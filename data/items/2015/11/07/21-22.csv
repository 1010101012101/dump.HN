They are drama queens crying out for attention. Now imagine putting 10 drama queens in a room together with 100 innocent bystanders. That is the media industry. They will tire you out. Media organizations have several proven strategies to push our buttons: voyeurism, outrage, greed, fear, prurience and envious aspiration are at the top.<p>This is compounded by the fact that the world is full of people acting crazy and doing awful things to each other. News organizations are actually pretty careful to not bombard us with constant photos of dead children, even though Syria alone could fill the pages of the NYT everyday with images of their mangled bodies. (I have sat on the photo desk, and seen the photos stream by on the AP feed -- they rarely make the paper. )<p>So news organizations are aware of the fatigue that certain sensations cause, and they seek to mitigate them.

10526360,comment,10523668,10525166,0,0,T-R,,,"SQL is incredibly low level<p>- Modelling Sum Types requires giving up correctness guarantees, performance, or both.<p>- It&#x27;s not expressive enough to get performance or abstraction - I can&#x27;t communicate &quot;this is a one-to-one relationship&quot;, &quot;this is append-only&quot;, &quot;this is associative&quot;, or &quot;these things commute&quot; in anything but comments. And my co-workers need to remember to make those joins, and think about how they can use that information to hand-optimize, because the optimizer sure as hell isn&#x27;t going to do it for them.<p>- There&#x27;s no abstraction/composition of anything at lower than a full query granularity, so everything needs to be inlined and repeated everywhere - this makes conceptually small changes, like going from single- to multi-column primary keys or vice-versa, require rewriting practically every view/query.<p>- Some optimizer WATs are required by the spec (&#x27;where&#x27; clauses can be propagated down the AST even past another clause that does type refinement; CTEs always materialize the result set and act as optimization walls), others may be implementation dependent (At least in Postgres, &quot;Union All&quot;, instead of acting like a simple stream concatenation, more often than not materializes the whole result set and pages it out to disk - your 0.2ms query now takes 2 seconds). SQL is &quot;Lazy when the stars align&quot; and optimized by &quot;this won&#x27;t break things in the trivial case&quot; - most effort in non-trivial queries is spent trying to convince the optimizer not to hurt you on a whim. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the devs do absolutely impressive stuff with what they&#x27;ve got - these quirks are clearly what needs to be done to compensate for the spec, and the spec can&#x27;t change for compatibility resons - but it doesn&#x27;t make it easy to work with.<p>- Things like missing a column in a join clause (like when changing that primary key) cause significant bugs that don&#x27;t actually throw an exception/type error anywhere - they just change the size of your result set. This could be completely fixed with type-level literals.<p>- Types are internally inconsistent, and supplied functions are pretty much ad-hoc &quot;we thought this might be useful&quot;. Type conversions regularly involve first converting to a string or wrapping in a nested query.<p>- The syntax is pants-on-head ridiculous for anything non-trivial, making education difficult and maintenance tedious. (especially window functions - SELECT a, b, LAST_VALUE(b) OVER (ORDER BY c ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS x).<p>The problem, though, isn&#x27;t just the amount of code and maintenance issues this creates - it&#x27;s the sheer amount of information that everyone on your team who touches the database <i>needs</i> to know and not overlook <i>just</i> to not create subtle bugs and significant performance issues. And all this knowledge is completely non-transferrable.<p>SQL is so bad that standard practice is just to not do anything on the database unless you have to; eating the connection overhead, adding yet another cache, and having a layer of wrapper functions are just considered the cost of doing business, leading a lot of people to think SQL is perfectly sufficient for what it does.",1446932677

I don&#x27;t know anything about the EU law we&#x27;re talking about, but I do know a bit about US sales tax.<p>First, if I sell a service, not a physical product, my understanding is that I don&#x27;t pay sales tax at all.   Next, even if I am selling physical product, I only need to worry about sales tax in the state in which I do business.   In my case, California (and <i>maybe</i> Washington, as I have a contractor there.)<p>But really, it&#x27;s a non-issue, because I&#x27;m selling a service not a product.<p>Now, if I was selling a product, it is more complex than it sounds.   Yes, as the business, I don&#x27;t worry about taxes in the states where I don&#x27;t have a presence, but those customers are expected to file a &#x27;use tax&#x27;  -   many people don&#x27;t, and some businesses take advantage of this, for example, provantage will ship my supermicro crap from California to Ohio or some other midwestern state, then back to me, so that I don&#x27;t have to pay them sales tax.   It&#x27;s super irritating, because I pay my use tax, so it&#x27;s extra accounting work for me, and it  is extra shipping money and time.   I usually end up getting the provantage price and sending it to my local supermicro re-seller (kingstarusa)  and buying from them afte rthey price match.  But the point being that the selling company doesn&#x27;t worry about sales tax if they ship a physical product to a state they don&#x27;t have a presence in.   That&#x27;s the recipient&#x27;s problem to sort out (or ignore)<p>But that&#x27;s not really the complexity of the US sales tax system.   The complexity is that within the states you do business, every county has a different sales tax.   And I&#x27;m supposed to figure out what county you are in and calculate your tax.  (fortunately, I don&#x27;t have to pay each county; I pay the state board of equalization)  -  it&#x27;s a pain in the ass.  you need to buy a special database, because counties don&#x27;t line up with zipcodes always, and yadayadayada.     It&#x27;s doable, just not fun.      But I bet that&#x27;s more complex than calculating a different vat for each EU country, though actually paying each EU country might be a bigger pain in the ass.   Seems like something that could be outsourced to your payment provider, though.<p>(note, this information about state sales tax is about a decade out of date;  that&#x27;s about as long as it has been since I sold physical goods.   Point being that it&#x27;s both more and less complex than you imply.)",1446932570

In many cases, employment increases for a while, which benefits a minority of citizens while the external costs of business are socialized, and then eventually the part of the resource that is cost-effective to capture is exhausted, commodity prices change, or for whatever reason production stops.<p>Meanwhile, there has been less incentive for the state to develop a diverse economy based on taxing earned income then there would have been without the income from selling extraction rights, and everyone who lives near the project is back where they started: the jobs are gone, but the public is often left with a big mess to clean up. In addition there are other major employment sectors and stakeholders that may be negatively impacted, such as fisheries and tourism, and legally guaranteed native subsistence rights. In other words, the kind of industry often results in a &quot;resouce cursed&quot; economy and polity.<p>I grew up in Alaska, and I own land in Southwestern Alaska. There was a closed mine in my home town. The reality of the situation is, the resource is so valuable that as a political matter, it&#x27;s virtually impossible for state or local residents to prevent the state from selling extraction rights on public land because the local citizens can&#x27;t compete financially with an out of state lobby. Several of our state politicians have been convicted of accepting bribes from private companies. There is simply so much money to be made that extraction projects on public land are almost inevitable, with or without the consent of the public.<p>I&#x27;m not certainly not opposed in general to mining or oil production, but if the resource is public, the decision should be made democratically.<p>Should the state sell mineral rights on public land if the majority of it&#x27;s population doesn&#x27;t want to? Shouldn&#x27;t people who live near the public land get a vote?",1446932373

I even went to an informational session for one, since I was thinking about it... the way these charity events generally work, at least here in U.S. (not sure about that particular event in Australia and the fundraising requirement it imposes) is that the participant is required to raise a minimum of 3X the amount of the expenses for doing the event.<p>So for example, if the hotel/airfare, event registration, and other misc training costs (generally this is water/snacks for group training on the weekends, e.g. the classic long run on a Sat morning for marathon training) are roughly $1000, then the participant will be asked to raise $4000. And of that $4000, $1000 goes to letting them do the event and $3000 goes to the charity.<p>That was for the one I went to, not to name it specifically however it was a marathon in a foreign country. So airfare and hotel and the pasta meal the night before. A local event won&#x27;t need so much diverted so the fundraising burden will be much lower. I&#x27;ve done local charity events which only required $250 (no fancy travel or lodging), so rather than bug all my friends I just wrote a check and submitted a matching form from my employer!<p>So on the one hand, if your goal is to donate to the charity, you are better off giving money directly. But that&#x27;s true of most fundraising situations as well.<p>On the other hand, if you view the expense as the cost of getting donors, maybe that is reasonable. A mildly obscure disease might not have a better way of attracting donations other than aligning with a sports event. I&#x27;m just speculating here since the specifics probably vary hugely and I have zero experience on the race director side of the registration table or with the fundraising side of a charity. ;)<p>Basically, I can understand your skepticism - your donation money is more effectively used directly to the charity or on people doing local events. If the goal event involves travel and hotels, then a chunk of the money raised by the participant goes towards them doing the event.",1446932327

10526320,comment,10523788,10523788,0,0,takinola,,,"The real question, I would guess, is where you get your sense of self-worth?  It is worthwhile to do a bit of introspection to understand what really matters to you as opposed to what all the people around you tell you should matter to you.  A while back, I found that a lot of my motivations to achieve certain things where driven by pride and a need to show off to my peer group and not due to any real intrinsic desire for those things so I started asking myself why I was working so hard for things that I do not really care so much about.  The question I kept asking my self was &quot;What is your life worth?&quot;  If at any moment I was told my life was going to be over, what are the things I would wish I had accomplished.  The list I came up with (and it is a pretty short list) are the things I use to prioritize my actions.  I am always checking back to that list to be sure I am actually trying to accomplish those things.<p>One caveat about setting any goals that involve the approval of or comparison to other people (e.g. I want to be as wealthy/successful/beautiful/smart/talented as person X or I want to be famous and celebrated) is that there is always someone better, more successful, prettier, smarter or whatever-er you desire and so chasing these dreams are a mirage.  I remember reading an article in Forbes (or Fortune, I forget which) which described what life is like for various stages of wealth.  The descriptions of life for people who are worth seven figures then eight were pretty much what you would think but I will always remember the first words used to describe people who have a net worth in the low hundred millions: &quot;Prepare to have your ego crushed&quot;.  I remember thinking that&#x27;s ridiculous, if I ever have a hundred million dollars, there is no way that I would feel insecure about my status and then I realized that I know a lot of fairly wealthy people (in the seven to eight figure range) who are very, very insecure about their wealth and in fact feel like failures simply because they are comparing themselves to others.  The only way to win this game is not to play.<p>Also, do realize that we are all very influenced by peer pressure.  Why do you think there are red states and blue states?  You think somehow every one in a particular geography just decided to have a certain set of opinions?  Nope, my guess is 80% of our opinions are driven by the opinions of the other people around us.  So the practical way to make this work for you is to find people who have the values you want and hang out with them.  Also, limit your interactions with people who move you in the other direction.  If&#x27;s tough but for a decision as important as this, you should try to actively shape your life rather than have it just happen to you.<p>Lastly, you should always separate your happiness from your achievement of your goals.  You should be happy and fulfilled regardless of the outcome of your strivings.  Your goals, however wonderful, are just one aspect of your life and not the whole point.",1446931963

But recall how it used to be an actual form, where you had to submit a query? That took time. Since then, there are features like suggestions and results-while-typing, which help reduce the overall search time.<p>BTW, when you say &quot;next Google&quot;, remember that you can&#x27;t decouple Google from its advertising-based revenue model.

A brief outline, though:<p>* There are places where the scorecard is factually misleading. For instance: there seems to be no coherence to what &quot;source code available for inspection&quot; means; it still lists Telegram as being open source!<p>* It&#x27;s oversimplified in misleading ways as well. Systems which technically have the capability of verifying peers are given big green checkmarks even when that feature is so broken as to be useless. And, of course, there&#x27;s the &quot;been audited recently&quot; checkmark, which, as anyone familiar with software security auditing will tell you, means absolutely fuck-all (again: ponder the fact that libotr, which has been a high-profile target for something like a decade and is more or less frozen stable, was counted as &quot;not audited&quot;, while projects that got a 1-week drive-by from a firm specializing in web security got a big green checkmark).<p>* What does &quot;security design properly documented&quot; even mean? Where&#x27;s the methodology behind the chart? A few paragraphs of text aimed at laypeople isn&#x27;t a documented methodology! The one place they eventually did add documentation --- &quot;what&#x27;s a good security audit&quot; --- tries to explain a bunch of stuff that has almost nothing to do with the quality of software security inspection, and then throws up its hands and says &quot;we didn&#x27;t try to judge whether projects got good audits&quot;. Why? Why didn&#x27;t they consult any named outside experts? They could have gotten the help if they needed it; instead, they developed this program in secret and launched it all at once.<p>* The project gives equal time to systems that nobody uses (at one point, Cryptocat was near the top of the list, and ChatSecure was actually hidden behind a link!), and is ranked alphabetically, so that TextSecure, perhaps <i>the only trustworthy cryptosystem on this list</i> (with the possible exception of the OTR clients) is buried at the bottom.<p>* If the point of this chart is to educate laypeople on which cryptosystem to use, how is anyone supposed to actually evaluate it? They don&#x27;t really say. Is it ok to use Jitsi&#x27;s ZRTP, despite missing the &quot;recent audit&quot; checkbox? What about Mailvelope, which is missing the forward-secrecy checkbox?

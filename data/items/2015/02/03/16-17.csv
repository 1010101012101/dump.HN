Now, getting the tongue off the cheek, you&#x27;re right, it makes a lot of (at least an economical) sense to look under our nose at the swaths of unexploited but with a higher promise land and, you know, use them?! Only that the thing is, Venus colonization is more than just a new place that we could find useful to extend into for a current-way of day-to-day human life. It is a lot more! Some may tell you that it is bad to have all the eggs put in the same basket and Venus would be a good second basket, but again it would be a lot more than that. Imagine that so far we haven&#x27;t had any signs of another life-form living in our universe. As small the chance for this to stay this way as it may be, we can assume for now that the entire universe is ours to extend into. And we need to become capable of doing it. We may &quot;start&quot; doing that by colonizing our own galaxy. For that we should become capable of colonizing planets in some reasonably-close star systems first. And for that it would be desirable for us to learn how to do that using a planet somewhere nearby, in our solar system. And yes, for that we should become capable of colonizing without much struggle harsh places like deserts (in polar or other regions), subterranean and ocean depths here on Earth. And more, those should become self-sustained, to mimic conditions of some far-away colonization prospects. In the long run Venus is just one of the intermediary steps, but an important one. We as a species need that kind of colonizing experience. Of course it won&#x27;t happen right away, but setting the goal of colonizing Venus is in itself a task that rise awareness and spurs in the meantime other important intermediary necessary goals. Biosphere 2 falls in this category, but we need more, and more - we need context for which these kind of projects would come to make sense.",1422982658

Notes and picking up tasks was super easy. Made everyone more compliant with comments on issues and tracking customer tickets. \n  - HelpDesk tickets turned into development tasks without loosing any fidelity or communication. \n  - Training videos were really good, webinars and support was also good. \n  - Pretty fast resolution to issues\n  - Flexible project management methodologies.\n  - Burndown charts and other reporting was very flexible and pretty simple to use. \n  - A lot of customization is possible.<p>Dislikes:\n  - Wasn&#x27;t opinionated enough at times, leaving too many options for people to choose from\n  - Customer portal was, at the time, difficult to setup. This was about 3 years ago\n  - Takes some setup to get it right, the out of the box ruleset and details just aren&#x27;t enough.

About 107 years ago, my grandfather was a twelve-year-old boy and as all boys at that time and his social class did, he went to work in the forest, logging trees with his father and brothers. They were not the poorest, but had to work hard to make a living, and that meant also children.<p>A pile of logs came loose and rolled on his knee, crushing it. My folks were so well-off people in a well-off area that they actually took the boy to a doctor, who said that his knee might never recover and he couldn&#x27;t work in the forest.<p>&quot;What use do I have for such a boy?&quot; was my great-grandfather&#x27;s reaction, in a tone of agitation and disbelief.<p>No tears for the boy, no expression of sympathy for the immense pain. It was simply the grief of losing labour, a pair of hands and feet that could work for the family, a family which had for generations made a living in subsistence farming but now could work the forests for the emerging paper and sawmill industries. He had no use for a boy that couldn&#x27;t work.<p>That might sound totally heartless today, but those days, it was the natural reaction. A kid who couldn&#x27;t contribute, e.g. in logging trees, was just a useless mouth to feed. My grandfather&#x27;s knee mended eventually well enough for him to work, and he died of tuberculosis at the age of 56, ten years before I was born.<p>And our family was not at all the poorest of families; they lived in a nation that was at that time ahead in poverty reduction of where much of India is now: there was even a new, universal school system! And there were those industries that were exploiting child labour.<p>How the world has changed. My own father still worked the forest with a horse; in between he went to a world war and then again worked the forest with a leg that was shot to pieces and did not mend well. His hands were rough with calluses. But mine are soft. Beside school I got a job at cemetery digging graves, earned money to buy a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, became a software engineer.<p>Even if logging and debugging MySQL slow queries is a bit tedious, it&#x27;s so vastly more pleasant and less dangerous work than logging trees and debugging lice from your bedclothes at a lumber cabin, which is what our previous generations did, that it&#x27;s worth leaning back and thinking of. Still, the development to this status required that people like my folks did this work and eventually built a nation that could produce someone who could produce MySQL.<p>Parts of the world are still the same. Those sweatshops are a step in between miserable subsistence farming and modern welfare. Yes, make them safer so that no one is burned alive because the doors are locked.

At the right pricepoint this must be attractive for those who just want something &quot;that works&quot; but if its too expensive, just using plain old wifi bridging will beat them out. Not sure how business will react to this as they typically have ethernet all over the place and don&#x27;t need, or want, wireless bridging of access points.<p>I do wonder why no one has made a wifi device that does bridging over 5ghz but does 2.4ghz for clients. No client-side interference issues to worry about as the three WAPs communicate with each other, but at the cost of 5ghz for clients (which most clients dont support).<p>I think the larger issue here is why wifi gets so little spectrum from the FCC.  It would be nice if we moved towards opening up some more spectrum for home wifi.  Perhaps start working on making channel 2.4ghz 14 work, like they have in Japan. Shame the sweet 700mhz band was sold to the telecoms instead of given to the people for open access.  So here we are with the status quo of &quot;just add more access points&quot; and hope to god all your neighbors don&#x27;t do the same. As someone who has neighbors who already do this, it pisses me off there aren&#x27;t any clear channels for me to use, so I&#x27;m always dealing with interference.<p>I think eero could really cause some problems as one apartment dweller could take up all three overlapping channels very quickly and now everyone else around her is suddenly getting half or less the speed they are used to. In the age of 50-100mbps internet to the home, suddenly being unable to get all of that via wireless-N sucks. I have 50mbps internet, and can barely crack 30mbps over wifi no matter what channel I use. Over wired ethernet, I get all 50mbps. Netstumbler shows me, amongst other WAPs, my neighbor has 3 AP&#x27;s with the same SSID using all three non-overlapping channels, which is pretty much what eero is.  So what now? Nothing, I just have to suck it up or hope that wifi AC fixes everything. I suspect AC won&#x27;t make much of a difference if it doesn&#x27;t have the available spectrum.<p>Also, anyone else impressed with the PR this thing is getting?

Why it has been singled out is not clear, but until comparatively recent times it was found chiefly in scientific or technical writing rather than belles lettres. Our current evidence shows a slight shift in usage: sense 3 is somewhat more frequent in recent literary use than the earlier senses. You should be aware, however, that if you use sense 3 you may be subject to criticism for doing so, and you may want to choose a safer synonym such as compose or make up.<p>So it&#x27;s not even an issue of grammar, it&#x27;s just a meaning of &quot;comprised&quot; that some people reject.

This thread is far too nested anyhow, but here&#x27;s my complaint.<p>Yes, Parrot and Rakudo drifted apart. There were poor decisions all around. Patrick and Allison and I in particular talked extensively about how to improve things.<p>We decided this: I personally volunteered to fix any bug, patch any memory leak, add any feature that Rakudo wanted. I spent a lot of time doing that. Several other people also volunteered to add any feature Rakudo wanted.<p>Time and time again, we went to the Rakudo developers with proposals and they said &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Not yet&quot;. Thus my work was mostly fixing bugs and making minor performance improvements. (The major improvements were in that list. So were major revisions of most parts of Parrot to make it smaller, simpler, and faster.)<p>Then the NQP rewrite came. Parrot faced using a deprecated NQP for its compiler tools, adopting a deprecated NQP so it would keep working, or rewriting all of its compiler tools.<p>At that point, I decided that there was no point in working on Parrot and left.<p>I&#x27;ll take responsibility for everything I did wrong (or for not doing things I should have done). I don&#x27;t accept the current party line from Rakudo, however. To wit, &quot;Parrot of course had to be abandoned, because it wasn&#x27;t meeting Rakudo&#x27;s needs.&quot;<p>Parrot may or may never have succeeded. Rakudo may or may not have succeeded on Parrot. We&#x27;ll never know. Yet the claim that Parrot developers weren&#x27;t interested in making it work with Rakudo is nonsense. In my experience, it was the other way around.",1422980556

You can have a personal ethical system without a pretend religion. I don&#x27;t see how this is in within anyone&#x27;s interest or time. That said, I&#x27;ve seen things like a very liberal interpretation of buddhism take this kind of role. Mostly, it seems, for the benefits of meditation, but this is a small movement.  I&#x27;m not sure where millenials will fit into all this, but they are even less religiously affiliated than gen-x, which is a good sign, imo.<p>Personally, if I had a choice, I&#x27;d love to see things go towards a more decentralized role (personal and private spirituality) than yet another centralized role like organized religion, even if some new &quot;ethical&quot; religion takes over. I do sometime fantasize about some new spiritualism that&#x27;s outcome based, but once more than x amount of people are involved, then politics takes over and any ethical integrity is lost.<p>As a recent dad, I have found no real replacement for all the religious holidays part of my culture.  How do you replace Christmas? How do you handle relatives asking when you will baptize your baby?   My non-religious wife and I take a hybrid role where we&#x27;ll celebrate certain things for the sake of family, but won&#x27;t do others like baptism. I think shopping around for one of the more &#x27;less religious&#x27; religions is just a waste of our time and a disservice to our kids. I&#x27;d rather teach my kids the history, criticism, and the folly of organized religion than shove them into one my liberal values will tolerate.

The most cautious route is to avoid using “of” after any form of “comprise” and substitute “is composed of” in sentences like this: “Jimmy’s paper on Marxism was composed entirely of sentences copied off the Marx Brothers Home Page.”<p>>There’s a lot of disagreement about the proper use of “comprise,” but most authorities agree that the whole comprises the parts: “Our pets comprise one dog, two cats, and a turtle.” The whole comes first, then “comprise” followed by the parts. But there’s so much confusion surrounding the usage of this word that it may be better to avoid it altogether.<p><a href=""http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/comprised.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/comprised.html</a>",1422980199

This is the premise of the work done in Racket on contracts, and more generally of the &quot;gradual typing&quot; movement. Harper&#x27;s &quot;unityped&quot; term suggests exactly how this can work. An untyped function takes arguments that are all of one type, and returns one of the same type (that type being the &quot;dynamic&quot; type that includes every possible value, and thus is useless for static checking).<p>To call an untyped function from typed code, simply cast all your arguments to this type (trivial, since it contains anything), and check its return value has the type you expect (throwing an error if it&#x27;s of the wrong type). To call a statically typed function from untyped code, simply check the types of all the arguments you wish to pass to it (throwing an error if they don&#x27;t match its signature), and cast the returned value to the dynamic type (again, trivial).<p>I&#x27;m glossing over a very important difficulty, which is that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> dynamically check something of a function type -- if I&#x27;m handed a function, how do I know <i>at runtime</i> whether it&#x27;s of type `int -> int`? I can&#x27;t! So the solution is to &quot;wrap&quot; this function with a contract that <i>delays</i> checking until the function is actually called, at which point you can check the argument is an `int` and the result is an `int`.",1422979638

The average pay for this type of job is about $100 depending on how much extra overtime you put in.<p>How to fix it? I have some ideas but that would be on a much smaller scale. Basically a more direct model. The fashion industry needs to be disrupted and consumers must get more information about how brands produce clothes.<p>The problem today is that the government in Cambodia is extremely corrupt. They can&#x27;t be relied on to improve conditions or put up the minimum wage (well they have a little bit but it is still under what can be considered a liveable wage). The big brands however point the finger at the government (H&M, Nike, Puma all put out press releases that blame laws and government practices). They say it is the job of government to improve. They sit in their nice offices in New York and Stockholm, in cities that were built over a long time with a long history of democracy and with a society that was built bit for bit. That took a long time. It is incomparable to the state of Cambodia (which started on a blank slate 30 years ago or so). Thus the government there is not qualified to make the required changes. The brands however are. They are in countries with good laws and fairly decent labour practices. They should take responsibility. They should not hide behind their suppliers. They can easily define contracts that require suppliers to have better minimum standards and wages for workers. It would not mean much difference in profits for these companies. A lady makes a shirt and earns $3/day, does it really matter if she is paid $5/day? Would the $50 shirt cost much more at the store? Nope.<p>I think the most pragmatic solution is that developed countries introduce taxes for clothes that are not ethically produced. That $15 t-shirt from H&M should be $17 and with $2 clearly labeled as non-ethical tax on the price tag.<p>Also I see some commentators here saying it&#x27;s much better to work in a factory than to work on the rice fields. 20 years ago you could earn enough as a small farmer. Today that is not the case. Also the rising cost in Cambodia and elsewhere makes the small pay even more a problem than before. The workers earn $100. Rent is easily $30. I used to eat lunch at the market every day in Phnom Penh. It was about $1.50 for noodle soup. You can get a cheaper meal (I&#x27;m white and I added some better quality meat). But add that up. And consider you need to buy a towel. That&#x27;s easily $4. A new pan? $5 for a cheaper one. I lived in Phnom Penh in 2012 and then in 2014. Even I as a foreigner noticed the inflation.",1422979208

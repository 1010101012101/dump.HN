3087712,comment,3087659,3087659,2,0,chubot,,,"A big part of the brain is the divide between conscious and unconscious.  Your brain is constantly making random associations.  If I read an article about Steve Jobs, I might remember something a friend said 10 years ago about him; and then I might remember that this friend lives in Brooklyn now; and then think about other people I know who live in Brooklyn.  The brain just likes to make connections;  perhaps synesthesia is an example of it getting slightly overworked.<p>I would say the unconscious part is basically the equivalent of a visiting a web page, Googling every term on that page, visiting those pages, and repeat nauseum (so like an inverted index perhaps on concepts/ideas/sensations rather than terms).<p>As for the conscious part, that's where the magic is.  The unconscious brains generates breathtaking amounts of useless crap, but the conscious brain manages to filter it and do things like design software and make movies.  I can't really speculate on how the conscious mind does this.  Creativity is different than recall.<p>There is a feedback loop too.  If your conscious mind starts ruminating on stuff, then the unconscious mind will generate more of it.  We had a discussion about how writing down dreams causes you to produce/remember more of them.  There is also the phenomena of playing a game like Tetris or Scrabble, and then your unconscious brain starts ""rehearsing"" all the moves in the background (sometimes against your will).  It knows what you've been doing and just starts going off and making connections.<p>(If you are interested in this general subject, read ""On Intelligence"" by Jeff Hawkins.  It will at least get you thinking and he has pretty fairly concrete ideas.  He doesn't go into what I am writing about here, but as far a books that pertain to your question, I was reminded of it.)",1318074410

3087695,comment,3087461,3087461,2,0,grovulent,,,"Hmm - I think we need to think this claim through a bit before assenting yay or nay.  It's just more complex than this.<p>First of all - let's take your claim that Google engineers aren't social.  What really do you mean by this?  Break it down a little.  You clearly don't mean that they are complete loners that never interact with anyone.  Most of them have families and friends... etc.<p>So there must be some kind of sense of 'social' that you mean - that Google folk don't match.  Now - you haven't elaborated, so I can only speculate.  But the first thing that comes to mind to me is perhaps like those 18-19 year old girls that never spend a moment without Facebooking, tweeting, sms'ing, etc to their large cadre of similarly obsessed teenage girlfriends.  Theirs is a life of duckfaces in pretty dresses.  Yep - those folks are pretty damn social.  And if THIS is the sort of social you mean - how many Facebook Engineers do you think match this profile?  Zuckerberg himself is not exactly known for his extroversion.  Yet he built the most successful social network around.  And had he been an extroverted college girl that like to post duckfaces, it's much more unlikely that he would have.<p>Secondly - their is an implicit assumption behind your thinking that sociality is this kind of static thing built into humans that is not contextually determined by environmental circumstance.  But it's not.  I wrote a long essay about this - if you want in-depth arguments... please read:<p><a href=""http://reviewsindepth.com/2011/07/paul-adams-dunbars-number-and-the-hidden-narrative-of-social-networking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reviewsindepth.com/2011/07/paul-adams-dunbars-number-...</a><p>I believe that online social networks will fundamentally alter sociality - it already has.  But to see this one has to be able to think outside the current frameworks of how people relate to one another.  This is actually very difficult to do when you're immersed in the current stream of sociality.  One actually needs solitude in order to see the potential for new kinds of relationships.  And this is a view that I think Zuckerberg himself actually shares, insofar as he thinks that online social networking must push people forward into a brave new world. (not that I necessarily agree with his particular vision).<p><a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebooks_zuckerberg_says_the_age_of_privacy_is_ov.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebooks_zuckerberg_sa...</a><p>If you don't really understand what I mean by saying sociality can be altered contextually - I'll give you one example which always helps me think about it, which I take from my essay linked above.<p>One intuition that we have concerning online social networking is the 'cheapness' of the connections that we make.  We tend to laugh at people that have thousands of facebook friends.  We say - but they aren't really 'true' friends.  What causes this intuition?  Well - it comes from the drop in the economic costs in signalling friendship made possible by online social networking.  Sure - going out to dinner signals a greater amount of loyalty than just poking someone on Facebook - but poking is still a kind of signal nonetheless, and it signals a kind of relationship.<p>If you don't agree - consider how things stood around the dawn of language.  In order to signal allegiance to other primates, you had to spend a large amount of time grooming other people in your group.  The costs of this were so high - you could only signal to a small number of people.  But imagine as a thought experiment that we developed language overnight.  Now you could just say to people that you were friends - without having to groom them.  And this has a much smaller economic overhead.  But imagine how it would have appeared to most primates...  It would have seemed CHEAP!  Such friendships would have been ridiculed.  Only the grooming based ones would have been thought authentic.  Yet very important kinds of relationships were able to develop on the basis of language - ones that enabled much larger forms of groups.  It enabled institutions that would have been scarcely imaginable back then.<p>So as I see it - what we are building today in our online communities takes a vision that goes beyond what most people can relate to or understand.  And this sort of vision requires extraordinary minds - and such people have typically struggled to get along with the common folk.",1318073800

Here are some of your argumets. I try coming with some answers.<p>1) ""To me, free is the freedom to use whatever I want, including propertiary software.""<p>In this context, when we talk about 'Freedom', we mean 'Free Software'. Fortunately, Richard Stallman, they guy you are bashing about, defined the term 'free software'.<p>Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.<p>Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.<p>Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.<p>Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.<p>This is what 'Free Software' means. Please, feel free to use any propertiary software you want. But please dont try changing or misusing the 'Free Software' term. This is the software freedom rms talks about. When arguing about 'Free Software' you dont have the right to change the meaning of term for the sake of argument.<p>2) ""Richard Stallman is crazy. We should replace him with someone more practical.""<p>Free Software Foundation is an ideologic campaign. Its not a Software Project. Its not there to create a fancy UI for your desktop. Its there to pusht the concept of 'Software Freedom'.
	FSF doesnt care about quality of software. Their priority is freedom.<p>GNU project, on the other hand, is a software project. It includes many many software projects, created by hundreds of programmers around the world. You probably have emacs, gcc and gnu coreutils on one of your devices. These are written by rms. He has doe more. Way more.<p>He puts his work where his mouth his. He has done some high-profile work. He IS a practical person.<p>GNU project is a software project. Richard Stallman created it. Created emacs, gnu coreutils, gcc and many other projects on it. He has done A LOT on his 'practical' side of efforts.<p>FSF should NOT be run by people who would give up a penny on software freedom for practical reasons. Because insisting on software freedom is its mission.<p>3) ""Richard Stallman is politically incorrect.""
	Yes he is. That is the way he is. Like it or not.
 Respect his individuality. Not everyone should be 'politically corect'.
	However, that doesnt mean he is 'wrong'. Most of the times, he is a very harsh guy making very valid points.<p>4) ""rms should 'step down'.""
	rms should step down as what? As the leader of Free Software `movement`? Well, there is no official 'leader' on this movement. Its just that people value his words ad his work. And he earned it.<p>Now, you say he should step down as the president of Free Software Foundation? Why? He is the founder of FSF. He drives it the way he wants. If you (or anyone else) think you could do a better job of pushing free software through an organization, GO DO IT. Free Software Foundation is not the 'exclusive' supporter of Free Software.<p>(There are already other orgaizations like FSFE)<p>Now, enough defending rms. I dont think he needs me or anyone else to 'defend' him. As a matter of fact, I bet he would argue me about many things I write here.<p>Lets talk about you this time.<p>Most of you are the people who use propertiary software. Even develop (or dont mind developing) and selling propertiary software and its 100% ok to you. You use Macs and iPhones because they have a litte bit fancier user interfaces. You praise Apple because its products are 'slick'. You would immediately choose a propertiary software if its technicaly 'a little bit' ahead.<p>You occasionally drop a few hundred lines of code on github and then think you are a contributor to Free Software? No.
Your reasons for sharing that piece of software is usually very 'Open Source'. You do it because you want a good resume. You do it because it gets you credit and karma. You do it because its fancy. Most of you dont do it because of Free Software. You dont actually care about Free Software.<p>Disclaimer: Im among you. Im not like rms either. We barely have people like rms. Thats what makes him noble and the right person to lead the Free Software movement.<p>Sorry for not-good-enough English.<p>Edit:Formatting.",1318072890

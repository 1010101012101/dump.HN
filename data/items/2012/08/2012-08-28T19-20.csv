I contributed exhaustive articles in publications such as Smashing Magazine, CopyBlogger, etc. The articles were purely educational in nature, taught people what A/B testing was and VWO was introduced as one of the of the new tools to do A/B testing easily.<p>The second big focus was on passion for feedback from early customers and incorporating that into the product.

If you know his view on immutability, values vs identity, transactions, and so forth, then you already have a pretty good idea about what kind of database Rich Hickey would build if Rich Hickey built a database (which, of course, he did!)<p>- The talk extends his ""The Value of Values"" keynote [1] with specific applicability to databases<p>- Further, there is an over-arching theme of ""decomplecting"" a database so that problems are simpler.  This follows from his famous ""Simple made easy"" talk [2]<p>- His data product, Datomic, is what you get when you apply the philosophies of Clojure to a database<p>I've talked about this before, but I still think Datomic has a marketing problem.  Whenever I think of it, I think ""cool shit, big iron"".  Why don't I think about Datomic the same way I think about, say, ""Mongodb"".  As in, ""Hey, let me just download this real quick and play around with it!""  I really think the folks at Datomic need to steal some marketing tricks from the NoSQL guys so we get more people writing hipster blog posts about it ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy</a>",1346183900

You aren't going to make tons more money, like if you invest in breakout startups.<p>The point is more that a16h realizes most of its returns through the small percent of startups that do phenomenally well.

And if you offered them a more typical amount they would say ""Nah, I'll just go sell it on Ebay rather than take that offer."" So you could get a discount (sort of a real world buy it now) but your leverage was greatly diminished.<p>In the world of investing, and Venture Capital specifically, I think Andreessen Horowitz brought a better understanding of value to the table.

My principle above still holds: needing comments tends to hint that your design could be better and/or your code could be cleaner.<p>Maybe your library is flawed. Maybe JS is fundamentally flawed. I'm not making any comments one way or another about what's flawed in this picture or how to fix it, just that seeing this comment indicates room for improvement.<p>Imagine the <i>ideal</i> design/architecture for a given application on all levels. Does it involve the users of this code or API explaining everything in lengthy comments? Or does it involve a clean, beautiful, and elegant set of interactions that is both transparent and intuitive as to what is going on? The latter, I argue, needs no comments. The former, I argue, is indicative of design flaws or inadequate function names.<p>So why do we see necessary comments in real life, then? Because real life system designs are rarely ideal.

One thing that's nice about a bigger house is that you can have special purpose rooms.  If you have only a living room but would love to have a pool table, you're either out of luck or need to convince whoever you're living with (sometimes yourself!) that it's ok to stick a pool table in the middle of the living room.  Or you have to compromise and get one of those ""pool table slash foosball table slash pingpong table"" things that are pretty much worthless.<p>Another example is home theatre.  It's true that you can just put a big tv and surround sound in your living room, but that more often than not screws up the decor and larger purpose of the living room as a family gathering spot.  When you have a dedicated room, you can go nuts with the stadium seating and all of that.<p>That said, I've downsized in the past two years from a two story four bedroom house with a yard to a one bedroom apartment.  I'm now preparing to spend the next several months in an RV.  I'm actually much, <i>much</i> happier with this arrangement.<p>For some, space is a true necessity (large families that wish to keep their sanity).  For others, space is a luxury that they can afford and that truly makes them happy.  For people like myself, though, I've found that I only wanted what I <i>thought</i> space could get me... ""breathing room"".  Turns out I needed psychological and intellectual breathing room more than I need more physical space.  Perhaps that will change as I get older, but right now I'm glad I learned that I can be <i>happier</i> in far less space.

These will likely require a distribution network, so fighting bike theft might benefit from focusing on infiltrating those networks.<p>I had a friend who bought a bike lock that was insured against any thefts (whether they were quick with the insurance, I don't know). When he went to register it, he saw that there were two exceptions, one of which was the city in which he lived: Eugene Oregon, a town with tens of thousands of students. After asking around, he was told bike thieves there loaded entire bike racks onto trucks in a couple minutes, then removed each lock at their leisure in a storage facility.<p>I find it hard to imagine that they sold them off individually: it's too suspicious to have a few people selling hundreds of bikes. Likewise, delegating to underlings to sell the bikes also seems too risky, as several people now know about the enterprise. I suppose they sell wholesale to used bike shops in other towns who are in the know.<p>The solution in this case would seem to be turning criminals into witnesses, a la drug enforcement. Enforcement on an individual-basis wouldn't work: mere possession of a single stolen bicycle is unlikely to prove criminality. I doubt penalizing individuals for owning a bike (as with counterfeit money) would work either: if I go to a used bike shop to buy a bike, they're not going to give me the ""stolen discount"" - the shop is going to mark it up to the same price as legitimate used bikes.",1346181198

Helping out country men from the north east, and surviving the daily tribulations of India with stoicism, and the ability to be open to all castes, creeds and colors<p>The discussion started from a post talking about <i>Indian heritage</i>, and the things which you listed(substitute <i>people from north east</i> with just <i>people</i>) are basic qualities expected in a decent human being - there is nothing uniquely Indian or heritage about it.<p>> The one thing that united most of India was mysticism and the belief that we are one under some god.<p>More often than not, I don't see a united India, which doesn't bother me much as long as people treat other people as human beings, and not some abstract entity(viz. Hindu, North eastern, Tamil etc). Countries are imaginary boundaries, intentionally and/or unintentionally created for various reasons(ease of administration among others).<p>Mysticism is something I never subscribed to. I was indifferent to religion, miracles, rituals from a very young age. I believed a relation between me and god is personal, and priests, temples, rituals have no business being there. Eventually, I became an atheist. Granted not many people are atheists(in India, or any other part of the world), but <i>people not into mysticism</i> is very common. I am pointing this out as you were listing it as something which is inherently Indian, and I am saying it isn't and there isn't an authority which decides the Indian heritage.<p>> You can experiment with that as a start.<p>Experiment with what? Mysticism? Show me, I will verify. If it works, at that point, it isn't mysterious any more. If it doesn't, it is just imagination gone wild.<p>> It's what bound the Sufis, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and several other religions during the best of our times.<p>If that is the binding factor for you, good for you. For me,  I don't give a shit which part of world you are from, what gods you worship, what color your skin is, what language you speak etc etc. You will get basic ""one human being to another"" respect, followed by ""earned respect"". If I just met you, you get the basic respect and empathy. If you are a superb programmer, good doctor, good athlete, good human being... you earn my respect. If you are an asshole(homophobe, sexist, xenophobic, wife beater...), you lose my respect. My system works for me and I don't see a reason to switch to Indian or American or Martian system.",1346180831

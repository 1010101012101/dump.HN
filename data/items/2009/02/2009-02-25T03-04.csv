494014,comment,493549,493792,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"What makes a ""feature"" a ""feature""?  Due to the nature of software, it's nearly impossible to adjust your ""scope zoom"" to be set on ""feature.""  Example:  If my one feature were: ""allow users to send e-mail,"" or let's make it easier... ""allow users to write a comment.""  I'm already at a loss as to what <i>exactly</i> that means.  It may or may not be a feature (and may or may not be work to implement) any detail of that, such as allowing comments to be multiple lines, allowing other characters besides a-zA-Z0-9, formatting, storing the date the comment was written, etc.<p>Give me any 1 feature, and I can zoom into it and <i>force</i> you to accept other features that need to go along with it, otherwise rendering it near useless.  Likewise, you can zoom out from any aspect of software and see that the ""feature"" really only works because it's part of a greater whole.  That's where my confusion over ""launching 1 feature"" arises.  There's really no such thing as a ""feature"" per se, but a some Platonic-esque form of your software that you strive to achieve.<p>I think it's precisely this kind of mysterious trickery behind software that makes it <i>so hard</i> to make specifications, test, debug, etc... and why something like 80% of all software projects go either over budget or miss their deadline.<p>This intangibility of software is also why I take advice about it with a grain of salt.  It's easy, after the fact, to look at what you've made and point out the ""one thing"" that made it work.<p>I like unalone's concept of the ""core goal"" behind your project.  PG and others talks about this as well.  Focus on the one core thing your software does, and do that the best.  This has problems also... because there's nobody to tell you that your ""zoom level"" of the goal is just right.  What if my software's goal is to ""make users happy?""  I could encompass nearly anything with that.  Conversely, I could set my goal to be: ""to allow users to post a 140 character message"", which is way too specific in and of itself to create a useful product.<p>I guess my point is that software, and nearly all other feats of engineering, are extremely organic.  I'm skeptic about advice on the topic by ""proven successes"" for two reasons:  hindsight is always 20/20, and selection bias.  I think what it really comes down to is using your best judgment.<p>AndrewWarner, I'd love for you to investigate:  ""What do you start with?""  I think it's one of the biggest blockers for would-be entrepreneurs, and puts off so many people from even starting.",1235534178

Not everyone has the same preferences or treats risk in the same manner.  Anytime you start saying cost-benefit analysis you have to deal with the issue that there isn't one cost-benefit analysis.  That makes it not science. 5% of GDP is huge but it doesn't have the same effect on each person in a society.  There's also no way to take 5% of GDP without undesirable side-effects and those also have unpredictable distribution.",1235532602

Granted few people seem to think this is a worthwhile investment (I don't know), but it's not like it's pie in they sky fairyland talk either.<p>One approach would be:<p>Solar home / hot water heaters for every home / building in the continental US.  (Pointless in Alaska)   This would pay for it's self fairly quickly so IMO it's a good idea.<p>Power the grid with a combination of Wind, Thermal Solar, Hydro, and Nuclear, with large grid connected energy storage systems.  This pays off in the long term, but it's expensive.<p>Electrify the nations highways, so electric cars can cross the country without backup power.  Also add charging stations to most parking lots.  This is where things get really expensive and there is not an off the shelf solution for this.<p>So, the real question becomes how far down that path you take before the costs outweigh the benefits.  Which is where knowing how much damage you get based on what level of carbon output.

6169132,comment,6168885,6168885,3,0,conorh,,,"Recently I spent around an hour writing a small image resizing server in Ruby/Rails and Go (a fixed amount of time in each). I have several years of Rails experience and a year of Go experience. The Go server code was significantly more verbose, had far less features and worse error handling given the amount of time I had. I realize it is not the best comparison given that I am more experienced with Rails - I believe though that it would not be that much different even given a few years more Go experience. Yes the speed of Ruby and Rails can be frustrating, but I find it is often not needed, and if it is you can just rethink that piece or do it in a language that is more suited to the task. For development productivity I have yet to find a combination of language/framework that let me write maintainable code in as short a time (having worked over the years with frameworks in C/PHP/.NET/Java etc.).",1375822788

While it seems to solve Twitter&#x27;s problems for the time being, it gives an incredible amount of power to the person who has your phone  which may not be you. Being able to authorize a new login <i>without any kind of authentication on the administrative side</i> (as managed by the Twitter client on your phone) means that anyone in possession of your phone is in charge of your account.<p>You leave your phone sitting around and someone else grabs it? That person can easily authorize a new, permanent login, and you probably won&#x27;t even realize it.<p>If you&#x27;re going to go as far as a second factor like this, why not authenticate the approval?<p><i>edit: verbiage and clarity</i>",1375822745

Any moment half of your stuff might be gone (a bit of exaggeration and could be your fault but still). Men are still seen as providers despite alleged &quot;equality&quot; so they are expected to have more of that &quot;stuff&quot; to get married.

6169118,comment,6168885,6168885,7,0,anko,,,"The article is just wrong.<p>> And its no wonder. Until Rails 4, the core framework didnt even support concurrent request handling. And even in Rails 4, concurrent request handling is multiplexed on a single CPU core, leaving Rails unable to take advantage of the parallelism of modern architectures.<p>Every single rails installation I have seen runs multi-process and takes advantage of multiple cores.  And then he goes on to say something similar, but says thats a disadvantage because the processes aren&#x27;t using shared memory to communicate and have to use memcached.<p>The thing is, the rails model means rolling restarts are a lot easier, and you are lot more flexible with deployment strategies.<p>> However, modern dynamic languages (and their incapacity to do the sort of meaningful pre-runtime verification of basic semantic well-being one expects from a compiler) place a burden on test coverage. Of course it is essential in any language to provide test coverage for core algorithms and other subtle aspects of a software module. However, when trying to move fast&quot; and get to market quickly, one shouldnt have to write tests for every souped-up accessor method or trivial transformation.<p>I&#x27;m still undecided about this angle.  I simply don&#x27;t find types to be a problem.  While I agree fixed types are more performant, not dealing with types makes the code more fun because you&#x27;re not held back from running it because you forgot a typecast.<p>Tests are essential, but the flipside is that tests are quicker to write in a duck-typed language, too.<p>The post of obviously trolling for clicks - even the title is saying nobody should use rails, and then it gives his times when you should use it at the bottom.",1375822640

6169111,comment,6148512,6148512,1,0,rektide,,,"I get a kind of jQuery feel from .NET, but I haven&#x27;t been following along for 9 years. By jQuery feel, I mean a fairly uneducated developer base that is happy to be well served by rote practice and already-engineered tooling. It&#x27;s not an engaging or creative work environment, it&#x27;s a get things done world where you kind of wade through &quot;solutions&quot; until you cross paths with some existing code that does whats needed, and use that. There&#x27;s a bazillion people around all kind of muddling through with various backgrounds who pop up to regurgitate whatever tidbits they themselves have picked up. Both jQuery and .NET do a decent job of providing some componentizing, so you can pull stuff in without having to understand it. You certainly don&#x27;t have to understand the target platform either: the web. RoR has a lot of similarities too in being a culture that remixes the available, and in hiding the real workings, within and of the target.<p>Before losing my sense of place in .NET, I was heavily enjoying alt.net stuff, largely owing to Boo (Python-alike .NET language with fantastic metaprogramming, AST, macros). Rather than take the normal webstack with Boo, I was using CastleProject&#x27;s MonoRail (Ruby Sinatra alike) + Jayrock (old+excellent JSON omnibus lib) and Spring.NET to build json rest web-services. For me, it was easier investing in my client side and web application skills than it was learning how to dive into the engineered WebForms and ASP.NET and prototype-era ASP.NET MVC work to make them exhibit the behaviors I wanted. It was a great environment to code in, I liked the toolchain I&#x27;d come to use, but it was far afield the large .NET world and I had only scattered groups of practitioners (in these various techs I&#x27;d elected in) to work with & no overarching place to for myself as a developer of this Boo+MonoRail+Jayrock+Spring.NET thing I liked doing and thought fine.<p>I tend to believe ASP.NET MVC is probably in great shape by now and serves getting shit up very quickly. At the same time, I think culturally MS- alike jQuery, RoR, and let&#x27;s throw in Apple- remains monocultural, with people invested heavily in fixed technologies that already define a huge amount of the experience and whose use won&#x27;t port &quot;out,&quot; (monoglot) and there&#x27;s not a creative community base that celebrates those striving & seeking less beaten paths, the polymaths. The intellectual level of engagement is, in short, pretty shit, and the community is at end to help the far-ranging. Too many end-developers (end-users of dev kind), not enough well-motivated, working-for-it journeymen, and mastercraftsmen far removed and few between, with too few to sound out the practice with broadly and not situated for helping the weirder polymaths below experimenting with weird shit. Tall organization, huge fat base with low minimum bars to entry, and monocultural to boot: death.<p>Or rather, undeath: sustained, undying yet no longer alive quite either.",1375822561

</code></pre>
I suspect that the particular mitigation strategy the BREACH authors&#x27; describe as &quot;Randomizing secrets per request&quot; could be implemented by having {% csrf_token %} instead emit:<p><pre><code>  <input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;random_data&quot;

...where the random_data changes every response, the emitted csrfmiddlewaretoken_xor is the real token XORed with the random_data, and upon submission the server will again XOR the two values together to get the real CSRF token.<p>There may be other secrets that need protection in other ways, and maybe this would make any random-source issues more exploitable... but this would seem to protect the CSRF token, in a cheap and minimal way.<p>UPDATE: Thinking further, though, maybe the attacker can probe for both values at the same time, and thus determine the probability of certain pairs, and thus this only slows the attack?

The most recent Rails app I wrote has average render times of 7ms (excluding network latency) on dedicated hardware largely because most views can be rendered with just 3 memcached hits. What&#x27;s more, implementing the nested caching strategy necessary to achieve this was pretty simple with the out-of-the-box capabilities of Rails 4. If I&#x27;m busy worrying about lower-level concerns it doesn&#x27;t matter if my runtime and framework are blazing fast - I don&#x27;t have the confidence or time to implement strategies like this, or at least not with nearly as little effort.

Sorry if my explanation is a little disjointed. There isn&#x27;t one particular issue that explains it all.<p>I see the whole issue as completely artificial. It was almost entirely created and started by Gavin Newsom (former mayor of SF). It was a demogogic move on his part to try to get support for his run for governor several years later.<p>Aside: Ironic it backfired and ended up pigeon holeing him as a far left politician.<p>No one talked about or wanted gay marriage before he brought it up.<p>A more nebulous reason is that society is moving away from marriage. People are more and more living in civil unions. Marriage has become a religious/traditional thing. So revising/redefining antiquated traditions to appease a group of people seems unnecessary.<p>I think the idea of redefining a term like marriage is also rather problematic for me. It&#x27;s always described a union between a man and a woman, since like the times of Hammurabi - and now we&#x27;re just redefining it? It seems a little absurd.<p>The address the issue, we created a new term. &quot;Civil Unions&quot;. But for some reason this isn&#x27;t good enough - and I don&#x27;t know why. Seems like the real goal is to redefine a several thousand year old term - which kinda seems revisionist to me.<p>Another argument I&#x27;ve seen and that I&#x27;ve never seen addressed is: why do gay couples get to marry and not polyamorous people? Seems like there is a double standard here.I personally feel like if they&#x27;re going to go through all of this, they might as well allow all marriage.<p>At the end of the day I wouldn&#x27;t really care if gay marriage passed. What bothers me the most is that so much time, effort and money is spent on something that is a rather insignificant issue.<p>The right to visit loved ones at a hospital and the tax benefits are more symptomatic of broken hospital/tax laws than a huge national issue on par with the civil rights movement. I think calling gay marriage a civil rights issue is hyperbolic and disingenuous (and is polyamorous marriage a civil rights issue too?). I think there are way way way more important issues currently to deal. Thousands of people are rotting in jails for non violent crimes, thousands of people have their lives ruined by medical bills, thousands of people are forced into plea bargains for crimes they never committed. There is so much suffering happening around us, and we spend out time arguing about redefining marriage. It&#x27;s just really frustrating for me to see this artificial debate occupy so much of the collective unconscious of the country (and now the world).",1375821871

They went through the effort and security risk to develop a custom protocol that doesn&#x27;t involve shared secrets. Good for them.  But if your shared secret only allows access to Twitter and is only stored on Twitters servers, its compromise probably entails their severs getting owned. In which case, the authentication schemes don&#x27;t matter.<p>Where this is somewhat more useful, however, is if you want to provide third party systems with two factor auth and not store a secret per user/service pair.  Then twitter&#x27;s severs being compromised and revealing the shared secret might expose other services. Of course, given how small HTOP/TTOP secrets are, I don&#x27;t think thats much of a problem.<p>Note, the usability issue is orthogonal to the protocol.

I&#x27;d be more inclined to assume that there are positives I&#x27;m overlooking, that might even outweigh the negatives. Especially for something as beloved by developers as Rails.<p>What evidence is there that running a process per core has a significant negative effect on throughput and/or latency in practice?

6168947,comment,6168379,6168379,1,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"Sorry for the brain dump, but here goes, I guess it depends on how large your company is, and the size of your admin team, along with how many emergencies you expect to have (is there is history you can look at? X emergency per month, etc?). We have 4 sysadmins, and we each have a cell phone, where we can communicate via sms in an emergency. <i>We are all on call, but no one is required to answer, so there is no schedule!</i> Our emergency rate is low, one page every 3-4 months (if that). When your emergency rate is low, by stabilizing your environment, and clearing defining what an emergency is, we have a culture where emergencies are really emergencies, like HVAC outage, uplink outages, etc. Personally, I like to be in the loop, even if I&#x27;m not helping. This does not happen often, as I said, so there is not really a burden.<p>First let me give you some advice about &quot;what an emergency is&quot; and &quot;how we are alerted&quot;. You need to define what an emergency is in your company, and notify everyone (with clear guidelines on &quot;how to get help&quot;), so that you limit pages to critical issues, post this on an internal wiki (you have a wiki right?). What is really worth getting woken up and coming into the office for? Alerts are issued like this, nagios alerts go to email, these are not generally emergencies, a couple checks do fire sms alerts, so I consider these email alerts issues for the workday, and I do not check these on the weekend. An automated system scans syslog for alerts that might be an emergency (based on prior experience (i.e. db errors about a disk subsystem, etc)), we also have our apps log emergency issues to syslog, and if one is triggered, a sms goes out to the group. We also have any helpdesk tickets (you have a helpdesk right?), with &quot;emergency&quot; in the title issue a page, users know to do this via the &quot;what an emergency is&quot; wiki page.<p>When a page comes in, if you can take it, you simply issue a sms &quot;ACK&quot; to the group, this tells everyone that you have Accepted this page, and you are the owner. This helps us load balance across everyone&#x27;s lives. If you need help, you pull in other people as needed. You also issue a sms &quot;All Clear&quot;, when the issue is resolved, this will typically go alongside an email to the group with an issue summery.<p>This entire system does not need to be complex. Start simple and iterate as needed. There also needs to be a process to find out what happened, do we need more monitoring, additional syslog triggers, etc.<p>ps. our UPS, HVAC, and security systems can issues pages via sms too as needed. I didn&#x27;t mention this because it highly dependent on our environment. We also use a modem and landline to issues these pages. We have a linux server with qpage [1] running on it, which issues the pages by dialing a landline at a telco. This allows us to issue pages if our network link goes down too.<p>pss check out my website @ <a href=""http://sysadmincasts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sysadmincasts.com/</a> where I plan to cover issues like this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.qpage.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qpage.org/</a>",1375821032

Although I went to film school I retaught myself (minus dreamweaver) to code for the web using front and back end technologies. There are a lot of great resources out there, but personally I really enjoyed Lynda ones. I feel that site gets the reputation that it&#x27;s for old people who don&#x27;t know any where else to go, but it contains very full and comprehensive walk throughs of whatever subject you&#x27;re wanting to learn. It does cost money however, so if you&#x27;re not willing to pay or don&#x27;t have the cash for it look around the web. Places like the mozilla developer network are a great place to start.<p>Long story short, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s really one-stop-shopping when it comes to learning something new. There&#x27;s a lot of information out there that requires a lot of research, but the great part (if you truly enjoy coding) is that it&#x27;s fun research, fun to search for new things, build new things, take on new challenges. :) Good Luck!",1375821016

Some of the world&#x27;s fastest supercomputers are based on POWER [1]. These supercomputers can have hundreds of thousands or even millions of cores for massively parallel computing. We&#x27;ve seen recently from some of these systems that the POWER processors are much more effective than x86 processors. They consume lower power and generate less heat. If combined with Nvidia GPU&#x27;s for CUDA and Mellanox&#x27;s commodity InifiniBand interconnect hardware, we could have affordable clusters for heterogenous high-performance computing.<p>In the past, the supercomputers/clusters sold by IBM do not include hardware from these other companies. I think this partnership with Tyan (major manufacturer of current x86 chipsets) will also allow 3rd-party vendors to build systems with IBM POWER processors.<p>In other words, POWER is not in the same market as x86 or ARM. It does have its own niche in the market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.top500.org/lists/2013/06/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.top500.org/lists/2013/06/</a>",1375820181

Such an ancient paragon of computer innovation should be able to come up with a clever algorithm that compresses but doesn&#x27;t substitute image bits.<p>But...<p>- The original story[1] didn&#x27;t mention that the product itself warns against the very thing they are reporting. Did they ignore that warning, did the copier not show it, did they use a setting that did not have the warning? Their further posts cover the issue, so it looks like somebody else set the resolution and ignored the warning.<p>- Calling what the JBIG2 algorithm does &quot;OCR&quot; is misleading. OCR is pretty much understood to be analog text (image) to digital text (ASCII, UTF-32). Matching to a real character set and outputting those characters is a defining part of true OCR. It&#x27;s also confusing because the copiers have a true OCR function, and this is not related. What JBIG2 does, I would call it &quot;sub-image matching and substitution.&quot;<p>- Calling JBIG2 &quot;lossy&quot; is also misleading. I suppose it is lossy by definition, but lossy is usually limited to pixel effects as seen in JPG, no image blocks.<p>- JBIG2 seems like an algorithm that shouldn&#x27;t be used on low-res text documents. You might say it&#x27;s just a configuration of the algorithm, but if engineers can&#x27;t take it as a tool and use it correctly, you start to wonder if it&#x27;s a problem with the tool.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_are_switching_written_numbers_when_scanning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dkriesel.com/en/blog/2013/0802_xerox-workcentres_...</a>?",1375819282

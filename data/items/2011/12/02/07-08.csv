3303158,comment,3296202,3302172,1,0,lisper,,,"> if your braces get screwed up for ANY reason there is not enough information left to reconstruct them<p>That's not necessarily true.  If my code is indented, then I can reconstruct the braces from the indentation.  Also, it's a lot easier to inadvertently screw up whitespace than a brace because there are so many more things out there in the digital world (HTML, autoindent) that muck around with whitespace than things that muck around with braces.<p>The right answer is to SPECIFY block structure using braces (or something equivalent), but then RENDER the block structure using (automatically generated) indentation.  It's perfectly fine for the compiler to complain if they don't match.  This is one case where redundancy is a feature, not a bug.<p>If you hate braces and love whitespace so much, why are you not urging Guido to get rid of the colon?  It's essentially equivalent to an open brace.  Why is an open brace more pythonic than a close brace?<p>> using a poor editor<p>I use emacs, but just to see if maybe I'm missing something I fired up vim and tried editing some Python code.  AFAICT vim (at least out of the box on Snow Leopard) is not aware of Python syntax at all.",1322812353

I don't know how it would apply in a work setting, but my ex husband had a big disconnect between his non-sexist ideals and the way he lived/assumptions he made.  On more than one occasion, I played to his ideals and kept my mouth shut about his sometimes weeks-long grumpiness over the friction between his ideals and his unstated assumptions/expectations.  This allowed me to gradually improve the latitude I had for pursuing my own goals in a situation where I was 100% financially dependent, with special needs kids in tow.<p>Humans are kind of like buggy software.  There is often contradiction between what they believe and how they behave.  That fact can be used as a force for good rather than just an accusation.

They also should ship with instruction manuals and data sheets with circuit diagrams.<p>I write GPU driver software (in userspace) for living. I'd be much more happier if I could push my code to GitHub for everyone to see.<p>However, I do understand that keeping the drivers secret can be a competitive advantage. GPU's are devices unlike any other, they're all different from vendor to vendor and model to model. The driver source code will reveal crucial parts of the hardware design. Knowing what your adversaries have in their chip is a disadvantage to them. I guess some reverse engineering probably takes place, but that is at a whole different level than actually seeing the source code.<p>OpenGL is also an issue. It's a nasty legacy API from Silicon Graphics, dating back to 1992 or so. It's not only a very crappy API for the programmer, it's also hell to implement. If you don't believe me, try to look for texture completeness rules in the GL spec (the problem doesn't exist in Direct3D, because they don't have backward compatibility or legacy API's to deal with).<p>So, having a working OpenGL implementation that passes the 30,000+ conformance test cases is also a competitive advantage you don't want to give away. It's worth several years of programmer effort.<p>However, I still think that we and everyone else should open source their GPU drivers and OpenGL implementations and compete in who makes the <i>baddass-est</i> silicon chips.",1322810989

One is sharing the output and the other is sharing responsibility.<p>Since you don't even need to even <i>ask</i> for the code for open source projects, it's there for the taking, the sharing is actually <i>better</i> than it was in the 1970s.  Largely this has to do with the greater ease of communication and distribution.  It's easier for me to share my code by putting it on github or providing a .tar.gz and forgetting about it, than it for me to have to cut a tape every time someone asks for it.  In fact, when companies honor the letter of many open source licenses by only making their modified source available if you actually ask for it or assert your identity by filling out a web form, rather than putting it on a publicly accessible site somewhere, they are often chided for making the user have to jump through hoops to get the source (notwithstanding the companies that actually violate the license and don't make the source available via any means, of course).<p>That the development style of not directly/immediately incorporating various changes from other parties may be a more cathedral, rather than bazaar, but nothing is stopping the recipients of the code from forking it and distributing and sharing their own changes with each other.  In fact, the very definition of open source is such that that is encouraged; that few do, or that people are not motivated to fork, has nothing to do with the culture of sharing the code, and, again, most likely has more to do with the ease of which it's possible to get the canonical version of the code and the branding behind the consistency of that canonical version.<p>I can bring a baseball bat I turned on my own lathe to the park and let other people use it, but just because I don't let someone else customize my bat or use my lathe doesn't mean I'm not sharing the bat.",1322809628

The monad laws you can take to be principles on which to correctly implement them, but they aren't necessary for their use.<p>Besides, that whole post just gave me the impression that you haven't done the minimum necessary to understand Haskell programs. You claim that there is no immediate visual grouping of the expressions, yet you seem to gloss over all the pattern-based definitions of functions.<p>Now, if you find using such lengthy sequences of patterns to define your functions unsavory, you can use case expressions, which... require indentation for their cases.<p>On most respects, it just comes down to the fact that Haskell is different, and it takes a bit of reading to accustom oneself to it.<p>edit: It was a tad too defensive before.

3639365,comment,3639175,3639175,62,0,patio11,,,"I have participated kinda heavily on HN and a few other Internet outlets for a few years, and both of my software businesses have been cloned.  BCC has been cloned multiple times, including by one regular user of a forum I spent a lot of time on, who is actually not lacking in savvy.  I do not make a practice of hiding the core tricks as to why BCC works, in fact, I have practically written the complete business plan for cloning it five times and begged people to start using the core tactics.  BCC is, at risk of stating the obvious, not the most technically challenging product.<p>My observations are as follows:<p>1) No clones have caused my business to fail.<p>2) It is <i>effing hard</i> to convince people to rip off good ideas which require non-trivial work or savvy.  Heck, it's highly nontrivial to get them to ""rip off"" those ideas when they pay five figures to have me write them down in a strategy document or build the prototype myself and hand them the working source code.<p>I mean, take A/B testing.  I have said ""A/B testing prints money"" so many times that some people are tired of hearing about it.  Empirically, most of my clients, many of whom have read my blog for years, do not A/B test before I work with them.  I talk to a lot of startups, some of whom are highly regarded.  Very few A/B test as a regular thing.  The savviest guy who cloned me doesn't bother A/B testing, either.<p>Please, good HN readers, ""steal"" that idea from me (or any of the numerous other people you could steal it from, because I certainly stole it myself).  The last company I successfully convinced to actually do it NDAed me vis-a-vis the impact.  Let me hum a few bars: they offered to hire me at a quant's salary to do it full-time.  (Cheapskates.)<p>And yet when we check back on who A/B tests here in February 2013, do you know what we're going to see?  A few articles about it, with wise comments like ""A/B testing can only get you to a local maxima"" and ""Didn't we read an article just like this on Smashing Magazine in 2006?"", and fairly few companies who actually have someone do it every week, even among the savvier folks.<p>P.S. Would love to be wrong about that.",1330358194

3639346,comment,3639117,3639117,13,0,einhverfr,,,"One of the most interesting books I read was ""The Servile State"" by Hilaire Belloc.  Belloc suggests that in fact most people when desperate will gladly trade freedom for subsistence.  He suggests the natural evolution of class warfare is from unrestrained capitalism to a welfare state, to one which legally compels workers to labor for the benefit of someone else.  And indeed that's the system we have in the US, if you listen to folks like Cornell West and look into the prison industrial complex.<p>The way out, as both Belloc and his contemporary Chesterton (Note:  I am NOT a Catholic.  I am NOT even a Christian.  I am not endorsing Chesterton's religious writings) thought was to try to push for an economy of the self-employed.  This idea may seem less welcome on a VC site....  But the basic idea is that if labor and capital fight, both get to declare victory, but really Capital wins.  The way to win if you are on the labor side is no to play the game, and go into business for yourself as an independent agent, freed from worker protections  but also in a relative position of power and freedom compared to where you would be as an employee.<p>Time was when almost everyone was self-employed.  The only reason it isn't for everyone is we make it so darn hard in the US.  I say that as one who has been in Indonesia and Malaysia for the past six months and I can say that no third world country makes it as hard to be self-employed as we do in the US.  Indeed no developed nation does either.....",1330357826

3639311,comment,3638455,3638455,25,0,DEinspanjer,,,"I have taken 200mg of Modafinil daily for more than 5 years.<p>Before it, I could go to sleep just about anywhere and just about any time.  I could easily sleep for 12 to 14 hours a day if I let myself.  When I had a work commute of about an hour and a half, I would have to pull over, sometimes four or five times, during the afternoon drive home to take cat naps because I couldn't keep my eyes open.  It didn't matter how much or how little coffee I drank, it didn't matter how much I slept the day before, and it didn't matter whether I was eating my typical diet which was fairly healthy, or if I had unusual amounts of junk food that week.<p>Caffeine doesn't work ""normally"" for me.  I like the taste of coffee, I usually have one cup a day that I sip throughout the morning.  However, I don't have a Folgers moment. I am not groggy until I get my first cup.  If I drink a soda or coffee or even have a shot of espresso in the afternoon, I don't get a sudden boost of energy.  I don't even get the boost of energy from energy drinks.  When I drink a lot caffeine or other energy drinks in a short period of time, I find that they will give me a mild case of the jitters, but even then, they don't counteract my actual drowsiness.  Hence, I've never gone higher than my typical cup of coffee in the morning and frequently a soda in the afternoon.  More than that has almost all down-sides and no up-sides for me.<p>I took a sleep study, and I was not diagnosed with narcolepsy because that diagnosis is very specific.  You must immediately fall into REM sleep.  I was diagnosed with a ""we have no idea what you have"" condition of excessive daytime drowsiness and received a prescription for Provigil.  Originally, it was a 100mg dose, but when that was not effective, it went up to 200mg.<p>It is a bit of a wonder drug for me, but certainly not in the terms that it was described in this article.  It doesn't make me hyper focused or give me unusually sharp focus, it just removes the incapacitating drowsiness I suffered in the afternoon.  I've actually found that music is more distracting to me during work hours since I started taking it.  While I still enjoy listening to various types of music for recreation, I don't play music while working anymore.<p>I would definitely say it is not addicting in the manner that coffee is.  On vacations and at times I didn't have my prescription with me, I've gone weeks without taking it.  There are no withdrawal symptoms, other than the fact that I would be excessively drowsy again, especially in the afternoon.  If I stop drinking caffeine, I will suffer migraines for about two weeks.<p>I will agree with the part about broad focus vs narrow focus.  I can think better about large system design late in the evening.  When I am working on an architecture problem during the afternoon, I find myself frequently rat-holing. I'll focus on one specific part and just keep going back to it over and over rather than spending enough time at the higher level.",1330357357

The doctrine of hell came about from the Greek view of Hades. This view was transplanted into a biblical view of hell during the dark ages by the church. It was not the original doctrine of hell. Jude 1:7 is very clear of the example of eternal fire, the translation is to burn up and be no more for eternity it cites Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of entities that underwent judgment by eternal fire, the symbolism of eternal fire is that the product is eternal not that anything placed in eternal fire burns for eternity. The book is very clear on the punishment for sin being death, not eternal torment in which the most rebellious angle is exalted with a commission to rule said eternal torment.<p>The reason I bring this up is not because I think that you need to believe what many think is a fairy tale. But because the very book documents such human nature and it may help your view of why some people need the book, yet may never even open it.<p>It documents that people will use the book and pervert it to their own devices. It also offers the wisdom that we should read what is in the book for ourselves and not let the actions and words of those that profess to be examples of the book be our brokers. There was a time when I absolutely loathed Christians due to the doctrine of hell. I thought that they worshiped a sick deity that never revealed himself and then punished people sadistically for their lack of belief in his lack of revelation.<p>My logical error was that I was relying on their misinterpretation to be my interpretation of what was actually in the book, I was relying on those very people to be my authority on what was in the book. Only afterwards did I come to realize that many of them are guilty of the same thing, they never read the book they just parrot what they here. I was asked by someone I respect a great deal, to read the book and it was after I did that I realize that the a part of the new testament is about those people, they parallel the Pharisees, it was then that I realized that most the people that claim to be of the book, have no idea what the book even says. So much so that they will accept that their god is a sociopath that will burn people forever, when the actual text is very clear on the laws and the justice laid out for them.<p><i>For every person calling their terminal illness ""part of god's plan"" as a way to deal with the stress of mortality, there's just as many people abusing each other and denying rights as part of ""god's plan"" too.</i><p>Again the book has very little to do with this, this is the word of those that claim to be ambassadors of the book. The old testament is an account of Jewish history and laws with divinity mixed in while the new testament is almost entirely a self help book about internal reflection, humility and forgiveness.<p>I guess my point is you can't listen to religious people about what is in their book most pervert it to their aims, or just flat out take others words for gospel and never confirm it and then parrot it as fact. Some of the writers of the books even have the foresight to explain such human nature.<p>Islam is the same, there is little justification in the book for their actions yet entire nations are lead to hold jihad in reverence because they are guilty of letting someone else read the book for them and tell them what it says. I used to have little tolerance for religion due to it's practitioners, so much so that I could have committed the same atrocities against them that they commit in the name of their books that they do not understand. Reading the text I actually came to see that a) there is a lot of wisdom in the books. b) that I now properly see the issue as complex human nature where I once had the simple convenient scape goat of religion and c) they are actually beautiful texts written by people that for the most part wanted to better humanity.<p>After reading the book I came to realize that Christ was actually a really awesome guy, he preached love and if everyone where to use him as a model the word would actually be a really awesome place. Whether or not he was divine or crazy is actually irrelevant to the fact that he was actually a great guy who really loved people and asked people to love and help one another. I was amazed to find that he was actually nothing like the people that profess to serve in his name. The story of Christ is about the redemption of men and forgiveness of all. Whether it is a fairy-tail or not, I think it is a beautiful and inspiring text that has a lot of value to the segment of society that actually take the time to read it. It is sad that so few people actually do.",1330356965

It's a second line of defense after Google's initial scan.</i><p>It's good to pay attention to cases like this, if only to flush other such cases out of the woodwork.  You say it's once, but it's more accurate to say it's at least once.<p>I also say that if I were greedy, I'd make my ""automated system"" confirm everything as a violation.  I'm not making that up as a crazy consume conspiracy theory.  That's exactly what robosigning was:  mass-production of claims that put the burden on consumers to figure out, and show evidence, of whether the company was making a valid claim or not.  Robosigning (or simply returning ""true"" in this case) is extremely cheap, gets the job done in cases where the company is in the right, and gets the job done in many cases where the company is wrong because some people fail to jump through the hoops placed before them.  In either case, it softens people up a bit before the company has to do any real work.<p>In the case of robosigning, it might actually have been profitable, even though they got caught at exactly the wrong time, when people were mad as hell about the crisis.  At any other time, the penalty for getting caught would have been lighter, and it's certainly profitable when you don't get caught.  If the strategy comes close to making money even in the worst possible case, I'd call it successful, and any established means of gaining an advantage at somebody else's expense merits a certain amount of vigilance.  We put locks on our doors, we have laws against fraud, and in cases like this:<p><i>rest assured you can always make an internet s_storm about it and your problem will be solved (this is clearly the ideal solution, yes?)</i><p>Exactly.

If your function takes a String as an argument, for instance, the compiler will ensure that it never receives a null instead. It will always receive an actual String, because normal types are non-nullable in Haskell. You have to explicitly wrap a type in a Maybe if you want to add nullability, and `Maybe String` is a completely different type from `String`, so the type checker can and will enforce that they don't improperly intermingle.<p>> and b) not call f with invalid parameters?<p>Same story here. If f takes a String argument, you can't (deliberately or by accident) pass it a Maybe String instead, or your code simply won't compile. The strong static type system in Haskell eliminates the mental burden of having to always watch out for nulls and handle them as a special case.<p>That may not seem like much of a burden if you're accustomed to languages like Python, Java, etc. where nullability is the default. But think about how much time you've spent dealing with NullPointerExceptions (or the equivalent in your language of choice) and imagine how much nicer it would be if the language itself could simply eliminate the possibility of them ever occurring in the first place. Well, thanks to its type system, Haskell can do that.",1330356183

I found one in particular that turned out to be the name of the city in which the game takes place (""Budayeen"", though it was completely garbled).<p>That was a stroke of luck because that word appeared many times in the text and gave me some clue about the adjacent words, since there are only so many words you could reasonably put around the name of the city.<p>I tried globally replacing the characters in DISKTEXT.TXT but was ending up with a word half as long as I thought it should be (for ""Budayeen""). One of the fortunate things that happened though was that it revealed to me, by accident, a couple other words (even though the decryption wasn't correct, it made some previously indistinguishable sequences look more like real words, which I pursued).<p>I think it really clicked that I was dealing with bigram substitution when I had to come up with a theory of how whitespace was so cleverly hidden.<p>Here's the lookup dictionary if anyone is interested: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/pxJU7q7F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/pxJU7q7F</a><p>And here's the script that does the substitution: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/8eYrGbzQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/8eYrGbzQ</a><p>You know, now that I actually think back to it, the lower 4 bits represent one character and the higher 4 bits represent the other.

If we are making an illiquid investment in say China, having Kroll investigate who has beneficial ownership of the other 85% of the firm, who in the Party are they connected to, and if anything shady is going on is useful. Additionally, given the increasing salience of macro factors in the capital markets having awareness of areas like Greece or Iran which are economically insignificant but carry the ability to effect asymmetric damage on asset prices (which traders have traditionally labeled as ""exogenous"" or ""fat tail"" scenarios) becomes critical.<p>On the offensive side the edge mostly deriving most traders' view of geopolitics as an exogenous risk. We were favourably positioned for the fallout in Libya, culminating in a life-changing trade where we syndicated oil being sold by the rebels in Benghazi.

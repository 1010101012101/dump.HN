There are lots of stories about how people would dread presenting ideas to Gates because he'd be brutally honest with how he felt about them. Same thing goes for Jobs - they care deeply that the <i>product</i> is good, so middle management is forced to focus on actually making good product. Whereas most CEOs and management care primarily about the process - we need the perfect process to make perfect product! Thus middle management that focuses solely on process. You never really hear much about the processes used at Apple, and I think it's because they don't really matter that much. What matters is the product and the consumer experience, and that is what Jobs cares about.",1297501153

2209673,comment,2209175,2209569,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""The mark of a true genius is the ability to hold two seemingly contradictory ideas in mind at once."" -- attributed to Albert Einstein<p>I remember, my first week of college, I had lunch with my advisor for the normal ""how are things going?"" chat.  I said that I really liked my physics course, but I thought the psychology/neuroscience seminar was frustratingly vague.  I liked that there was always a right answer in physics, but in psychology there're all these competing theories, and some experiments will point one way while others point the opposite.  It was all a contradictory mess of evidence, and you seemingly couldn't draw <i>any</i> conclusions from it.<p>He replied that once you get to the higher levels of physics, it was like that too.  (He'd done his Ph.D at Harvard as part of the team that won the 2001 Nobel Prize for discovering Bose-Einstein condensates.)  There are not clear right and wrong facts, there's only data, and sometimes the data will point one way and sometimes it will point the other.  And in order to make sense of that data, you need to be able to hold <i>all</i> the possible ideas, both right and wrong, in your head at once, so that you can sort them out.<p>I basically ignored him and then floundered through college.  But once I got out and into the working world, I found that pretty much all the leaders I admired had this ability to hold multiple contradictory ideas in mind at once and yet still make a decision.  And the authority figures I <i>didn't</i> respect lacked this ability, as did most of the people who never managed to rise into leadership positions.  It was a pretty discomforting realization, since I wanted to move into a leadership position and yet my whole life up till then, I'd been seeking certainty in my intellectual life.<p>When you reach a contradiction, there're a couple of possible responses.  You can go <i>narrower</i>, discarding the evidence that doesn't fit your hypothesis.  This is the Ayn Rand approach - ""Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction, check your premises.  One of them is sure to be false.""  Or you can go <i>deeper</i>, unpacking each idea into its constituent parts and keeping those parts that you can reconcile between the two.  This is the Hegelian synthesis.<p>It's not that one approach is necessarily better than the other, but if you want to have a big impact on the world, your thinking has to <i>encompass</i> the world, including all the parts that don't fit with your preconceptions.  If you limit yourself to faith, then the only people who can relate to your ideas are those that themselves believe on faith, while if you limit yourself to evidence, then the only people who can relate to your ideas are those who themselves believe in evidence.  You've excluded half the world from being able to hold a dialogue with you.<p>That's why I mentioned Kuhn and the Structure of Scientific Revolutions above.  Kuhn's contribution was to document how prevailing scientific thought shifts over time.  And he found that during periods of ""normal science"", scientists operate under the Randian paradigm - they sweep evidence under the rug that doesn't agree with the prevailing hypotheses.  But once in a while, someone will come along that actually looks at the experimental results that have been recorded as anomalies, and instead of discarding them, turns them over in his head until they can be made to make sense with the existing body of evidence.  Like Einstein and relativity.  And then you have a paradigm shift, and the body of knowledge advances to include both the old laws and the new evidence that has been discovered.",1297500373

2209656,comment,2206437,2209493,0,0,tres,,,"Yeah, I guess it does sound like I'm crediting Open Source and the geeks with singlehandedly saving Apple.<p>I don't think it was open source itself that saved Apple, but the decision -- as revolutionary as it was at the time -- proved to be an excellent business decision. They added value to their product (hardware sales) by integrating Open Source. And as a bonus, they appealed to a specific audience without having to invest significant resources in selling to that audience.<p>It was a brilliant business decision because it not only opened a new channel of potential customers, it opened up a whole new set of possibilities for integrating Open Source software; they could leverage the movement. And that's really the significance of the decision in this context.<p>Apple, Nokia and SGI all focused on their core business -- making hardware -- but only Apple saw the value of leveraging a movement to add value to their hardware/brand.  All three were in desperate positions, but only Apple saw the merit of leveraging the Open Source movement for the good of the business.<p>Where Nokia could have built on the goodwill of their brand by adopting an open and vibrant platform -- one where they could have as much control as they desired -- they have chosen to chain their fortune to a third party that has relatively little vested in their success.<p>The biggest irony here (other than Apple's role in Nokia's demise) is that choosing Android comes with very little risk compared to the risk that Apple took: there's ongoing development underwritten by a single organization; there's no licensing or quality stigma about the platform; there's a worldwide consortium of companies already using the platform; and there's already a significant and growing market share.<p>They have missed the opportunity to leverage the movement.",1297499244

AI is a biological, psychological, cog sci, EE/hardware, et al problem because, as you state, understanding how general intelligence works is important--as it is important to know how to build the technology that will run it (ie, possibly the memristor + something else, of course).<p>AI <i>is</i> a software (or other implementation of a specific algorithm) problem first, because general intelligence boils down to having an algorithm along with the right sort of inductive bias, and then running that in a world where it has input and its outputs matter.<p>While the other fields you mention may have something useful to say about what that inductive bias is, that doesn't mean that the core problem isn't one of software. The parent's point, as I read it, is that the specific type of <i>general purpose</i> hardware you run it on is irrelevant to solving that problem, and thus that this article is really rather sensational.<p>Apart from that, since we don't know what algorithms we need to solve that problem, it seems like premature optimization to start coming up with new hardware configurations for it.

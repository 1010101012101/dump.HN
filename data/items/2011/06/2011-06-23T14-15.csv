It was probably the most fun I've ever had in my career.  Anyway, one day the head of the branch gathered everyone together and talked about how he wanted to break off from the master company and build a machine vision startup.  Everyone was extremely excited and most agreed to follow him on the spot.<p>One week later 9/11 happened.<p>One week after that the same branch head gathered everyone together and laid off 80% of the staff.  You see, ""industrial machine vision was no longer viable""[1].

1. You probably can do without the <hr> tag separating the head and the rest of the body on the landing page
2. I see a signup button, but not a login/signin for existing user
3. I find the font a bit quirky, but that's just my preference.  I try to do non-cursive font for easier reading
4. The about page: a) url is sprint.im/user/about--that's a bit weird as I'd assume it's just sprint.im/about  b) shorter paragraphs and make the long paragraphs about ""why Sprint.im different"" into a list
5. Quick tour page: the bounding box of each step needs some top/bottom padding/margin. They're connected to each other right now.
6. Register page: a) help text for password is ""secret salt"" I get it, but I think the word salt would be confusing b) I don't like the arrow icon to the left--it's too big and too gaudy as a list icon
7. Just another thought/question for discussion as I am also wondering about this myself.  It's a B2B/Saas, I wonder if the fact that it was made by one person should be pin-pointed (on the about page).  Most people would prefer that their software is made by a team/group/company.  Having a single name as designer/developer takes away that illusion of ""faith"" and can turn a lot of people away.<p>I think it's a great project. Congratulations on launching your beta.  It's a great step and you should be happy and proud of it.  Now just iterate like a machine and I'm sure you'll definitely see some interesting movement.  Your space is interesting in that: there's a lot of players, but there isn't a king or someone who basically rule the rest (well, basecamp/jira maybe?), but that means if you focus (which I see that you are) you'll capture some market share that other guys haven't or can't seem to do.

The question should not be will Nokia's first wp7 phone run qt apps. It should be will we be able to develop wp7 apps using Qt technologies.  I am specifically speaking of QML.  Qt has been using web style technologies for a while.  I use CSS to style my c++ apps for example.  QML is basically what amounts to javascript and a json like syntax sitting on top of a c++ runtime.  With that in mind, it should not be that difficult for them to allow QtCreator to target, Symbian, MeeGo, traditional apps with QDeclaritiveView, a new Windows 8 runtime and a new WP7 runtime.<p>It would be huge if Nokia was able to leverage the existing Qt developer base for there new wp7 phones.  Personally, I am way more excited about the N9 running MeeGo than any of the future wp7 devices.  However that could change based on the developer tools available.

Do you want make all of them feel idiots?</i><p>Obviously you've never dealt with immigration. My wife was a Chinese citizen here on a student visa when we married, and so I've dealt with the process first hand.<p>It seems to me that most people believe that the process of getting a green card or citizenship is just a matter of filling out a couple forms, going to a notary, and waiting a few months for everything to be approved. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and as a result, many people who want to do everything legally, who really try to do so, wind up with an illegal status.<p>The process involves scores of forms that must be filled out just so. I can tell you from personal experience that figuring out exactly what the INS wanted was a challenge -- for me, an native English speaker who got 680 on the SAT verbal section. It's nearly impossible for non-native speakers, but many of them can't afford a lawyer to help them.<p>My wife's application was rejected twice. The first was due to confusion about the correct papers to prove marriage. The second was due to improperly collected fingerprints. We went to the State Police to have the fingerprint cards done. Who is better qualified to take good fingerprint samples than the police, right? We were rejected because the NJ State Police are not certified by the INS as fingerprint authorities. It seems that, to get the prints done legally, we had to drive to the duly certified fingerprint authority, some 40 miles away, which turned out to be a camera shop. Her prints were taken by some Indian guy, obviously an immigrant himself, rather than a police officer -- and these were accepted.<p>On one occasion the wife was at the INS office in NYC Federal Plaza. The woman at the counter was telling wife that something had to be done just so, no exceptions. Wife asked to speak to a manager to try to clear up the misunderstanding -- a perfectly legitimate request in any business. Rather than trying to work with my wife to resolve the disagreement, the worker pushed a little button, and two big burly guys came out of a door and physically removed my wife from the premises, claiming that she was a threat.<p>Obviously this process is not about a correct and complete application: they are about perpetuating the INS itself, through the fees for fingerprint certifications; shoring up their little fiefdoms, and so on. Anyone who believes that people who are unsuccessful in navigating this bureaucracy are criminals, bad elements that we don't want in our society, is badly mistaken.",1308840125

While simple and easy may be one facet companies or individuals are looking for, I think it's overused and the wrong approach.

This is a Damned if you do, damned if you don't problem.<p>a) Firefox must release frequently to keep up with competition. A firefox by any other version is just the same set of changes, just labeled 4.1 vs 5. I don't know why they changed their numbering system (to keep up with chrome i guess) but it makes absolutely zero difference.<p>b) Any corporation cares about stability vs progress. They want to test now, guarantee that it will work for say 10 years, and just stick with it.<p>And now of course<p>c) The web needs to progress. (ie6). IE6 is still being used. This has been beaten long and hard for years. The problem is not IE6, the problem is corporations. IE6 will die, it'll die soon (I hope) as I still have to support that heap of crap. HOWEVER tomorrow firefox 3.6 will be it. FF 3.6 will have some crap and work like shit 10 yrs from now and some corporation will want to use it and nothing else just like IE7 and IE8 and actually anything.<p>--<p>Anyone who embraces chrome is embracing a mindset, it will always be up-to-date and our it must support the latest version, we'll force a restart of chrome at some point to update that version. Our sites MUST WORK WITH LATEST CHROME.<p>Here we have examples of companies complaining, and I guarantee if Mozilla would state that 3.6 will be forever supported (7 yrs?) like IE6 was they would get the same shit MS got for IE6, sure not today, but in a few yrs ""omg fucking ff 3.6 can't do shit like rounded corners right, it needs to die"" followed by the FF3.6 eulogy website etc. The only way to win this is for companies to realize that the following will be true on the web:<p>a) security vulnerabilities in browsers will be discovered/patched, and quickly. You must upgrade frequently to keep up.<p>b) The web is moving forward, even if you dislike that. Due to this rendering engines must be updated constantly. Sorry. Adopt best practices and release frequently. Its an unfortunate cold hard truth and its costly but its the nature of dealing with the web.<p>c) Mozilla can't support an old browser forever. Pay them and they will. However they are not Microsoft, and even MS can't do this effectively, so if you want something for ""free"" (IE included here) be prepared for paying for having to move in the direction they take. Otherwise contribute cash to them to support what you want. I'm sure Mozilla will happily create a special FF3.5 branch back-porting fixes for years as long as you pay them to.",1308839459

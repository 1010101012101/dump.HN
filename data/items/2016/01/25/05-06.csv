Depending on how large those externalities are. The nice thing about this example is the code is there for you to modify and test your theories.<p>A good simulation tries to pare down the system, not getting distracted by other mechanisms that don&#x27;t change the basic dynamics. For example, it&#x27;d be more realistic if the transactions were partially parallelized, but that wouldn&#x27;t change the analysis much.",1453701595

A significant feature of Japanese bank accounts is money can move between them essentially instantaneously and Japan is a very cash-based society.  What banks do not want to happen is for someone to take a cookie-cutter LLC, do an ore-ore fraud (i.e. call up a bunch of Japanese senior citizens and get them to insta-wire their life savings to the new account), immediately convert it into cash (&quot;I need $200k for payroll in $100 bills&quot; is something that is not crazy in Japan -- getting rarer but not crazy), and vanish into the ether.  [+]<p>It does not help matters that a large Tokyo startup was a) a money laundering operation for b) a large international drug network then c) experienced more than half a billion dollars in suspected embezzlement while d) the banking system was caught with it&#x27;s collective pants down.  This current puts a giant blinking Give This Application All Possible Scrutiny on anyone who says &quot;tech company&quot; and &quot;international wire transfer&quot;, which is really %#(&)0$ing annoying when you&#x27;re a tech company which needs to get and make international wire transfers and does not have $100 million of business lying around to justify the bank doing fairly costly due diligence work.<p>[+] Edited to add: You might not think this sounds like a very plausible fraud, since it requires a corporate officer to make a personal appearance at the bank branch and produce identification, but the corporate officer might be a victim of the scam, too.  A &quot;local businessman&quot; who &quot;already owns another corporation so I can&#x27;t be director of this new venture&quot; approaches them about a great new job as company director, no experience required, the lawyers will take care of everything.  The lawyers (&quot;lawyers&quot;) draft paperwork and the director stamps everything.  On the first day of work the lawyer says &quot;Great.  OK, it&#x27;s the 25th.  First order of business: get $200k out of the account at the bank for payroll to the employees at the $FOO branch office.  Also, print out a receipt for your own salary; here&#x27;s the form.  We&#x27;ll meet you at the train station and walk you to the office.&quot;  At the train station the lawyer looks at the form, notices a misprint, and says &quot;Oh sorry, this is wrong.  We don&#x27;t want to make you look bad on the first day.  Tell you what, I&#x27;ll phone ahead to the company to let them know we&#x27;re going to be a bit delayed.  Wait here, I&#x27;ll pop back to the office, print the form correctly this time, and we&#x27;ll go in together then.  That&#x27;s the envelope?  Great; give it to me and I&#x27;ll put it in the safe; wouldn&#x27;t want someone stealing it at the train station.  Society is going to the dogs, you know?&quot;<p>Later that month, when asked by the police officers, the corporate officer can produce an impressive collection of meaningless powerpoint slides, business cards listing fake names of fake lawyers tied to phones stolen/registered with stolen credit cards/etc, and a total lack of understanding of what went wrong.",1453701283

(Name binding.) Think of all the other features in your application that can be reduced to this.

You&#x27;ll end up with an implementation that is very &quot;close&quot; to the core language. I would assert that this closeness strongly suggests correctness and composability.<p>Less philosophically, think of the Python virtual machine as a system with lots of &quot;safety valves&quot; and &quot;escape hatches.&quot; Import hooks are one such safety valve. Think about all the things you could do easily by hooking into module importing?

It&#x27;s common knowledge which is which, f.ex. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which extends to all the conglomerate&#x27;s suppliers and the employees of those companies, who will all use the same bank. This gives the major conglomerates enormous economic information, through the bank, about the financial state of their suppliers, as well as a huge amount of power over the companies, through the bank lending system. And this is before you get to the problem of Bank&#x27;s making very low interest loans to prevent companies going bankrupt - which in any case is common practice everywhere. Bank&#x27;s are structurally not able to absorb very high amounts of losses, so the old saying about the bank having the problem applies to large loans.<p>The only viable way to compete with Sharp in this example (well, apart from leaving the country), would be to go to one of the other conglomerates and pitch to be taken under their wing.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu</a>",1453699688

The VDP actually renders an extra 2 columns worth of background data (so 42 or 34 total) to enable fine scrolling. Rendering takes place 2 columns at a time to what I believe is a 32 pixel ring buffer. The data in the ring buffer is composited with the data in the sprite line buffer as it&#x27;s output to the display. The &quot;window bug&quot; is just a consequence of the 2 column coarse scroll granularity and the fact that it literally replaces the Plane A draws to the ring buffer.<p>This is not intended as a criticism of your code. If you&#x27;re only going for scanline granularity, most of the above is of little consequence (apart from the window bug) and would only add complexity. That said, I think my emulator, BlastEm[0], is probably a better reference for low-level VDP behavior as it has access slot granularity and mirrors the behavior above pretty closely. The code has gotten a bit messy though. There&#x27;s also Exodus[1], which has a quite heavily commented VDP core (a bit too heavily for my taste, but I imagine others may disagree).<p>[0] <a href=""http://rhope.retrodev.com/files/blastem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rhope.retrodev.com/files/blastem.html</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/exodusemulator/exodus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/exodusemulator/exodus</a><p>EDIT: Fixed typo &quot;line scrolling&quot; should have ready &quot;fine scrolling in the 3rd paragraph.",1453698811

10817553,comment,10811570,10811570,0,0,inthewoods,,,"Great thread here and the original article has some excellent points.<p>I recently left a company and explored executing my options via a vehicle called ESO Fund (www.esofund.com). In the end I did not use them for different reasons, but their offer was reasonable.<p>Two general comments on stock options:\n- Remember that bad things happen in companies in raising money. Your company could raise another round after you&#x27;ve executed your shares, and in addition to the dilution, you could also have an onerous term in that round - like a 2 or 3x liquidation preference - that will mean you are very, very unlikely to see any money.<p>- Remember that companies don&#x27;t have to have a liquidation event. I executed shares in a company I worked for in 2006. That tied up money in the company - and then nothing happened with the company for the last 9 years until this year I got a buy out offer on my shares at about 50% higher than I paid. Sounds great, except if you consider time. 50% return over a period of 9 years is certainly not a fail, but it also isn&#x27;t a big win over putting that money into the general stock market.",1451570293

I have previously used websockets on top of a traditional web app, and have been disappointed with the results.<p>My opinion now is that websockets are an all-or-nothing proposition. And I have gone all-in. My latest project has:<p>- websockets-only api (except a some image uploads and oauth/login)<p>- https-only<p>- single page app, central store with observable data, using a single connection servicing the whole application<p>- using SignalR (supports fallbacks for IE9 and old Android)<p>- Actor-based backend (Orleans)<p>This stack feels like the future to me, but I&#x27;ve had to learn a lot of new things. It&#x27;s quite different from the web development that I&#x27;ve done over the past 15 years. Overcoming the connectivity issues mentioned in the article is only the first step. Websockets need another type of backend to make sense: Actors. I&#x27;ve had many challenges with the async realtime behaviour of the system, deadlocks, etc.<p>But now that everything is working and I have some grip on it, I can&#x27;t imagine going back to a rest/database/cache web architecture.",1451567375

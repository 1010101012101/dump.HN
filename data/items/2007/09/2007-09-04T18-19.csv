The whole investment is the intellectual one in your playlist, which you can keep. At worst, if you discontinue Rhapsody, you could go and buy the music to replicate your playlist if you feel the need to own it.<p>I would be more concerned about the potential obsolescence of my investment in music in a physical medium or a particular file format.",1188931689
50076,comment,50015,50065,0,0,david,,,"I remember in the early days of reddit some people claiming reddit/digg were a good idea because they used the WoC idea, and thinking that wasn't really correct. I've always thought a lot of the problems with social news could be solved by following the WoC model more closely (ie: it would be a better way of getting ""a few interesting news stories""), but apparently I'm one of the 20 or so people who isn't hip to facebook, so I don't know if I'll be trying wildfire.",1188931627

50068,comment,49982,50025,0,0,mhartl,,,"Ah yes, selection bias.  In surveys of centenarians (people 100 years or older), a surprising number of them credit their longevity to eating onions.  Now, onions are good for you, to be sure, but will they make you live to 100?  Yes---if you have good genes, do a bunch of other things right, and are really, really lucky.  And so it is with all these ""multi-bazillionaires attribute their success to X"".  Are they smart and savvy, with possibly unusual backgrounds that give them an edge?  Sure.  But a bunch of other things have to go right as well---and even then I hear that the <i>most</i> successful people also eat lots of onions.",1188930444

I don't care if the JVM is well specified, this brings me nothing to my daily productivity.<p>What is the advantage of using Rhino on JVM against using native Ruby or Python? In Java, at least I know I will be very confortable doing automatic refactorings with Eclipse, which is the biggest advantage of Java against these other languages. Having coded a tool in Ruby with some good testing coverage, I still don't feel as safe to refactor as I was using Java.",1188929712

50056,comment,50015,50015,0,0,aston,,,"The reason Reddit and Digg are implemented the way they are is that they rely on people's need for attention to generate a constant stream of incoming links. Making it to the ""front page"" of whatever site you're dealing with is a badge of honor and indicates some sort of social significance. The incentive's just not there for people otherwise. The only people who'll submit links without any guarantee that anyone will see their submission should be using del.icio.us.",1188929346

This assertion is easily derived from looking at death statistics from each vehicle. But then, such statistics involve random parties. You or I aren't random drivers and so we may be very safe or very dangerous on the road [1].<p>Anyway, the average person's data is much more likely to disappear than that on google's server clusters.

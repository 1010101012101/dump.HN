Its often better to make the mistakes (while still exploring) and your next app will just be that much better.<p>Good luck and great choice :)!",1209375721
175494,comment,175466,175466,0,0,jamess,,,"Not all the good ones are gone, but it's certainly getting increasingly hard to find a sensible domain name. What worked for me recently is although I couldn't find a domain name that wasn't taken, I found a good one that was registered but isn't in use, then used the coarse expedient of offering the owner a few hundred quid for it.<p>My main concern is that most of the domains are ending up owned by a very few individuals concerned only with slapping cheap advertising on them. I refuse to attempt to buy domains from these bottom feeders, and I would suggest that everyone else do likewise. However, it's an increasing problem that's going to require either the advertising industry or ICANN to crack down on one of these days.",1209375661

Personally, I find a text version of a document to be indispensable.<p>I actually waited for the download to complete, and was still unable to print. First time I have ever had that problem.<p>What would be wrong with ditching iPaper altogether? Personally, I would convert the document to HTML, and provide links to download or view both the .pdf version as well as a plain vanilla text version.<p>That is just me though. I do appreciate your post however.<p>Maurice",1209374891

175485,comment,175282,175282,0,0,axod,,,"Instead of 'ajax' which doesn't really exist, I'd recommend learning javascript. Don't start with a framework or library, just learn the nuts and bolts of the language.<p>The incompatibilities between browsers are really really over-hyped, so I'd say using a library isn't worth it. At least until you have a solid understanding of all things javascript.",1209373784

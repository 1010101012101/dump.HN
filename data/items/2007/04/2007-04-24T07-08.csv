There's a lot of irony there, but I don't know how to make you see it.",1177401302

16249,comment,16234,16235,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Interesting concept. I believe there are more than a handful of regulars on this site that feel the need for better organization, and given how busy pg is (and he admits it), it makes sense to just take a stab. But do differentiate. Your project is in the right direction, but I agree it doesn't need to cater specifically towards YC rejects. ""YC rejects"" is probably the most exclusive group after ""YC teams"" (jk, well, you get me). Also see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=16211"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=16211</a> I dunno the overlap or similarity in vision, but it just seemed logical to ref it here.<p>The 5 points you list above sum to something greater than just those points. It's like a huge funded, connected marketing machine of experienced hackers. Camaraderie is an interesting point; in YC it's very easy to get everybody ""on the same boat."" YC invests in you, you deliver. They work for you, their investments, you work for them, your vision. The guys next door are also in the same situation. It's actually like a moderately sized company running parallel production pipelines. This setup is difficult to replicate because not only do you need the right people, you need the right money, and the right money and the right people.<p>Which means to do something similar, you cannot lack <i>any</i> of the points (wonders how Techstars and Highland are planning). Consider holding events (remember mydreamapp.com?); gathering a dozen or so beta-stage teams from here should be enough to throw something noticeable. A gallery kind of function, or project profile sorting by category and such, might also be good high-priority tasks. After all, your hosted teams are looking for investors/buyers.",1177399980
16248,comment,16098,16242,0,0,rtm,,,"Deferred logging is a huge deal! Appending a record to
a log takes one (or a half) of a rotation. A rotation
takes about the same amount of time as a disk seek. So
a DB that synchronously appends the on-disk log for
each transaction will be slow.<p>The huge win is if you can append many transactions to
the log in each rotation. To do that you have to gather
up many updates per disk operation. So deferred logging
is critical.<p>I suspect the reason PostgreSQL doesn't really support
delayed log flush is that they are thinking about ACID
transactions, where you really need the data to be on
disk immediately. A more technical issue is that the
log data <i>must</i> be on disk before the corresponding
permanent data (otherwise crash recovery will break),
and I suspect postgresql.conf's ""fsync"" option
has the effect of not fsync()ing the log at all, which
indeed would cause permanent corruption after a crash.",1177398810

I know you beleive that, but just look at the number of startups using MySQL.

Well, you know what they say-- those that can, do.  Those that can't, teach.  This goes doubly for entrepreneurship ""classes"".... though maybe I'm too harsh and that guy had actually started a business.<p>In terms of the number of millionaires or centi-millionaires in this country-- the vast majority of them got that way with ""lifestyle businesses"". <p>",1177398548

The problem is that the term ""lifestyle business"" is just derogatory-- it has no meaning. <p>Who are you to say that lifestyle businesses are not focused on growth?  Or that they cant' grow fast and change large numbers of people's lives?<p>There's a big difference between a restaruant and craigslist.",1177398233
16242,comment,16098,16232,0,0,dfranke,,,"That's a very strange knob.  What's the point of doing any logging at all if it doesn't let you recover from a crash?<p>I don't imagine that deferred logging is a big deal, though, because log writes are by definition sequential.  As Paul pointed out, sequential writes just aren't that slow.  You can build an array of 62 commodity drives for maybe $4000.",1177398092

5405104,comment,5402216,5403798,1,0,eah13,,,"You're right that I conflated the two above but the relevant feature of each is that they're a form of money creation. With a fractional reserve, the amount of money created (through leveraging the reserve) is inversely related to the size of the reserve. With fiat currency the 'reserve' the government has is nonexistent, allowing for unlimited money creation.  The government or a bank's ability to engage in money creation are both limited by the certainty that those using the currency have in its future value. If a bank loses it, we get a run. If a government loses it, we get hyperinflation.<p>Thanks for the distinction between the two concepts though. You're exactly right and gave a great explanation of them. I'll take a look at the free banking period. It does sound very interesting. Talking about the money and valuation sometimes it seems like all we have to measure things with is a rubber ruler, especially when the amount and value of currencies can be manipulated.",1363744767

5404945,comment,5403988,5404578,6,0,wutbrodo,,,"The purchase of the TV itself is not what's being discussed here, and frankly a bit of a strawman. As useless as it may be, a lot of households consider TV an essential item, so the question of TV marketing affecting men more has to do with _which_ television you buy, as opposed to buying a TV per se.  Per Nielsen, women watch significantly more TV than men anyway[1], so talking about marketing to men in the context of _whether_ to buy a TV is pointless.<p>As far as the _quality_ of the TV being purchased, it seems the point that GP was making (whether I agree with his larger point or not) is that the 60"" TV fills its function a lot better than the 19"" one which costs a tenth of the price. By contrast, as far as I know there is no correlation to ""how well a purse carries items"" and its price (beyond the very very low end, of course, but far from the $2000 level).  GP's point was that the price difference between a 200 and 2000 dollar purse is being spent almost entirely on brand (even the appearance is the same, when you consider off-brand purses), and the difference between a 200 and 2000 dollar TV is being spent on a VERY large difference in quality as far as functionality.  This distinction between ""paying for brand"" and ""paying for functionality"" is exactly the point that GP is making about marketing.<p>As a thought experiment, consider what would happen if Sony started selling its current flagship $2000 TV for 20 dollars, and it was widely known and permanent.  Now consider what would happen if the same happened for Louis Vuitton's flagship $2000 handbag.  The perceived value of the handbag would vanish almost instantly.  No one wants a status symbol that's cheap. You can't destroy _real_ consumer value (vs brand/marketing value) that easily just by dropping the price.<p>[1]<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/nielsen-gaming-tv-console/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/05/nielsen-gaming-tv-console/</a>",1363742691

5404874,comment,5402216,5403830,1,0,jvm,,,"Those are good points. I agree that it's essential to have a way for ripple issues to trade at discounts (another way of saying this is that ""Trust"" should be continuous rather than binary and it should be dynamically set by markets if possible). It would also be nice for issuance to bear interest as well.<p>However I think that ripple would still have a place in such a system. Anyone could start a trading site using the ripple protocol that allows ripples to be exchanged at relative discounts. The Ripple protocol does treat, say, jvm-USD as different from rdl-USD; when you do a transaction you have to choose the issuer. The nice thing about having a universal P2P protocol is that there could be more than one trading site using the same protocols, and wallets would be seamlessly transferable across them. The P2P network provides the assurance that the issued notes don't rely on a 3rd party.<p>As I said above, I don't really care if it's Ripple or something else but I think this is a really powerful idea, and I would definitely want it to work the way you're suggesting.",1363741628

I think Bitcoins might appreciate more than that, and I don't want to take on the risk.<p>On a planet with a growing economy and a growing population, Bitcoins will always be appreciating faster than material investments can grow.  If you can plant 100 seeds to get back 103 seeds (3% material interest) and also the planetary population is growing at 2%, that's 5% interest on Bitcoins.  Except then people try to hold more Bitcoins since they grow faster than seeds, which makes Bitcoins appreciate even faster... but even <i>before</i> taking that into account, you <i>still</i> wouldn't be able to grow enough seeds fast enough to pay back a loan in BTC, if the planetary economy used Bitcoin.<p>The deflationary process makes things much worse; the more people try to hold Bitcoins, the fewer circulate and the lower the velocity, increasing the apparent price of Bitcoins.  This process continues until instability in the price of Bitcoins as people occasionally dump their hoards is so great that Bitcoins stop appreciating.  Then fewer people want to hold Bitcoins and they dump their Bitcoins and the velocity goes up and the price goes down and the bubble pops.<p>(The reason this doesn't happen with existing central bank currencies is that central banks regulate interest rates to stabilize the supply of money and hence its price in response to velocity changes, or at least they're supposed to.  The reason this doesn't happen with equities is that they have an intrinsic rate of return due to dividends or stock buybacks; real estate has intrinsic rent; bonds have returns denominated in stabilized money.)<p>So like I said, Bitcoin is a horrible crackpot theory of money as a store of value, married to a beautiful transaction settlement mechanism.",1363741273

Rationally, it made absolutely no sense to me for the following reasons:<p>1) The idea of ""blood"" diamonds as well as the fat that the industry marks up diamonds to a ridiculous notion without translating any of those benefits to the societies it exploits.\n2) There is no tangible benefit to a diamond ring that CZ or similar gem would not provide.<p>That being said, my fiancee very strongly wanted a genuine diamond ring. When I explained my viewpoints and she understood and said that she did not want to force me to purchase a ring that I felt very conflicted about. At no point was our relationship in jeopardy over the issue. Even so, I knew that she really wanted a rock and it took me a while to figure out what to do.<p>In the end I decide to get her a ring because it was what she really wanted, even though she was wiling to suppress her desires to respect mine. I wanted to respect her wishes as well. If she had threatened or had gotten upset over the matter, I might have not reached this conclusion. Maybe she's just a super shrewd negotiator.<p>For me, the biggest blocking point is the human hardship that goes behind the diamond industry, and I was able to somewhat subdue this by seeking out a conflict free diamond provider.

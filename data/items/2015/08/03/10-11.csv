9994901,comment,9991120,9994730,0,0,rm445,,,"Good post, and well done for finding the numbers.<p>However the point of <i>Mars Direct</i> was to avoid some of the endlessly-extrapolating-upwards budget numbers by avoiding big technology developments (building a giant ship in orbit / launching from a moonbase / exotic engine technology); making use of elements present on Mars to produce rocket fuel on-planet from a smaller feedstock sent from Earth; and making use of automation, by preceding each manned trip with an unmanned fuel-production vehicle, with there always being one more lot of return fuel than human crews on Mars.<p>I quite agree with &quot;beyond non state actors&quot; - much of the above appears in <i>Mars One</i>&#x27;s plans, probably because it&#x27;s the only way they could even start to appear plausible on a below-shoestring budget. But for a state actor, or at least for the USA or some as-yet-unbuilt alliance of developed countries, Mars is possible with 80s technology, at a viable price. You don&#x27;t need to multiply the numbers up forever, so long as you resist distracting proposals from those who in reality want funding for a moonbase, or nuclear rockets, or whatever other technologies that promise first you have to solve a difficult, expensive problem, then Mars is cheap and easy.",1438599539

So does paying any tax, haha, this is why companies actively avoid them when they can.<p>I thought it was interesting where the survey referenced &#x27;paying off taxes will involve selling all/part of the business&quot;. This was around 40% positive across the categories. While firstly I&#x27;d take results with a pinch of salt as the people answering likely have an agenda to push, and a survey is not always reality. But having to sell some of a business is not a bad thing from a community POV. It keeps capital circulating in an economy. This offsets one on the main weaknesses of capitalism, that capital keeps concentrating. This conversation is about an equal society, so in that context I feel this is a good result, stopping people forever accumulating assets without having to release them. Hence it would be an easy argument liquidity problems from estate taxes could be a good thing for ensuring an equal society.",1438599389

One is to forever remain fuzzy and imprecise in your understanding, the other is to learn the notation you need, see how it matches your internal understanding, and then use it as an enabler.<p>If the notation destroys your understanding, then you didn&#x27;t understand it in the first place, you only had a vague sense of satisfaction with a pseudo-understanding.  This is akin to thinking you understand an algorithm, but not being able to code it.<p>I have every sympathy with people who find the notation a barrier, because so did I.  Over the years, indeed, the decades, I have come to appreciate notation as a way of concisely expressing deep and complex ideas.

What would syntactically be a reference to a method in other languages instead invokes the method with no arguments. It doesn&#x27;t have namespaced imports, instead its imports effectively behave like includes (i.e. the &quot;dump truck&quot; approach to imports). I could go on.<p>Ruby isn&#x27;t widely used in practice (although its users tend to be vocal and particularly prevalent in the web startup scene). Installing it requires some amount of care and technical knowledge (don&#x27;t even bother installing it with a Linux package manager -- you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to end up with the &quot;wrong version&quot; of ruby and rubygems).<p>I understand that Ruby programmers tend to be very emotionally invested in their programming language and that this book is probably written for Ruby programmers looking to teach their kids programming (using their favourite programming language) but it would be nice if there were well-written books aimed at a more general audience.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;best&quot; first programming language is. JS has its merits -- it&#x27;s becoming increasingly important, can be used throughout the entire stack of a web application and all you need to try it out is a modern web browser. Python is a lot more straightforward to learn and has consistent and mostly unsurprising concepts that are generally very compatible with more mainstream languages (plus it was intentionally based on a language developed for beginners). If market use were the main concern you could probably argue for Java or C# (although I think starting with a class-based language locks you into the wrong mental model).<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think Ruby is the best choice, even with its quirky community lore and the general emphasis on &quot;play&quot; and expressing yourself in code (although this seems to have died down a bit as the community matures).<p>I guess it depends on whether you want to teach programming as an art form and toy, or as a general skill (like maths, biology or chemistry).

I can only think of a few games that I feel do these things right, with the most recent notable example being the Souls series of games (Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1 & 2, Bloodborne).<p>In a Souls game the &quot;story&quot; is not fed to you in bursts of out-of-place exposition but instead is found in the layout of the environment, the description of items, and the types and placement of certain enemies. Hidden areas and items abound, and without a guide you would be hard-pressed to find everything available in the game in a singe play through. You are not generally kept out of areas that are too difficult to you. In fact, some of the more difficult parts of the game are readily accessible from quite early on. So you die. You die a lot. Which brings us to difficulty. While I don&#x27;t think these games are as hard as they are sometimes made out to be (you can out-level much of the difficulty if you want to spend the time doing so), the learning curve at the beginning is steeper than I have seen in a series in a long time. Games now have almost conditioned you to expect the developers to give you a break in the form of a special item or by restoring your health to full before a difficult section like a boss battle. This is not the case in the Souls series.<p>I kind of checked out of Zelda games after Ocarina of Time as I found the series less and less interesting as I grew older, though I still remember the old games fondly. While the characteristics of these older games are harder to find in newer titles these days, they are still rewarding and being used to good effect outside of the Zelda universe.",1438597907

Please don&#x27;t treat every word I use as totally definite.<p>Mathematics is the science of formal reasoning. I call the rules of reasoning, that is the rules of manipulation of statements including their lexicon, syntax and semantic, a logic. I see intuitionistic logic as the most intuitive, universal and fruitful logic, in short: <i>the</i> logic.<p>To reason, we need something to reason about. Said somethings should be respresentable, so we can communicate about it. Let me call the things we reason about objects. What do we use to represent objects? Symbols, pictures, sounds, smells and many more things we have senses for. We transmit objects as a literal, or as an algorithm (&quot;a turing machine&quot;) of how to recreate the object. All turing machines can be encoded with finite bit arrays.<p>It turns out we are able to make digital computers recreate symbols and pictures and sounds to a fidelity such that we can&#x27;t notice any difference compared to the original. I see no fundamental difficulty besides physical limitations to recreate other literals. All literals in a computer can be encoded with finite bit arrays.<p>Finally, I conclude that finite bit arrays are the most general objects we can reason about; they have rich semantics by the possibility to interpret them as turing machines. What we end up with looks a lot like common programming languages.<p>Based on intuitionistic logic, finite bit arrays, and the ability to interpret them as turing machines, we can follow the canonical construction of the reals. In this world, every object is a finite bit array, plus some annotated interpretation (&quot;a type&quot;), which is just notation for a bigger finite array. There is simply no place for non-countability.<p>I long for a software that lets me mix logic and usual programming seamlessly, without unnecessary like meta-theories, meta-logic. Coq is near, but the programming is too unnatural.<p>One can reason about the logic of a Rust programm, discuss it with others, and even the compiler understands some of the meaning, but richer intuitionistic logic statements about the output or behaviour of the code are sadly beyond the compiler.<p>I&#x27;m about to start applying for my graduate studies of mathematics. Do you have any recommendations which university to apply to to research in the area I talked about?",1438597165

But in new UI framework UI objects are indeed mixed up with game objects, and it makes perfect sense: they live in the same space. Game objects can be 2d, and UI objects can be 3d. For example, you can easily implement weapon UI as a physical display on your weapon&#x27;s back. You can change your menu from being 2d overlay to be floating in space and collide with level walls in 2 minutes.",1438596514

9994766,comment,9991538,9994584,0,0,golergka,,,"> Unfortunately that approach is rather cumbersome to reason about and brings with it unhandy syntax requisites. Given an entity UUID, how do you get a value for some property? It would be component_table_get(health_components, entity_id)->hitpoints. Or something similar. (note: what happens if you accidentily call that function on a entity_id for which no health_components entry exists?)<p>I work with Unity engine (which uses exactly that model), and in good code these problems don&#x27;t arise — or, rather, these checks are meaningful and actually represent the logic, rather then being &quot;unhandy syntax requisite&quot;.<p>Imagine that you have a lava object with a trigger collider (that means that it doesn&#x27;t influence the physics) and a Lava custom component (MonoBehaviour) on it. In `OnTriggerEnter` method of Lava you run `var health = GetComponent<Health>()` method on GameObject that entered lava and determine if that thing is something that can be damaged — because, quite possibly, it is a camera (as in that example) and the method will return null. And then, if it is something that you can damage, then you can use the `health.Damage(5 /* random dice roll */)` on it.",1438596318

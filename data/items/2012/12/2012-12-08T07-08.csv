4891090,comment,4889528,4890074,1,0,3d3mon,,,"Both of your examples are new to me as well, however I can make sense of topics discussed. Just to use your example, the first equation for B-splines defines it as a function from a tuple of ordered reals to real vector of dimension d. The real difficulty with math is not so much the symbols as they give a precise but very legalistic way of defining things but the underlying concept or intuition that it represents, the deep semantics if you will. The best analogy is law. The way a lawyer or judge defines things will be different from the way a lay person would due to the difference in precision. The descriptions will be technically correct but will make you second guess on what it really means. I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucks but math is definitely scientific legalese.",1354953350

What made Flash matter was video streaming and YouTube: suddenly all those who had been avoiding Flash because of stupid games and stupid Flash advertisements had to get Flash to view videos on YouTube. This never happened on Silverlight <i>to a major</i> extent; it always remained a weird alternative to Flash.<p>Curiously, Flash got killed too. I consider Flash dead in a similar manner that I consider Microsoft dead. They will both churn along for years but their supply of momentum is running out.<p>What practically killed Flash was the highly excretory nature of the Flash codebase. With the huge installation base induced by video streaming the Flash plugin had great opportunities per se but their codebase barely ran on a fast PC, and mobile Flash never materialized for real. First it was slow and when mobile devices got faster, it was a battery hog. So Flash got stuck in remaining the de facto web video player device and that space is slowly eaten out by various HTML5 based video technologies.<p>I hope we can ditch first Silverlight and then finally Flash in the shortest order of time.",1354951043

Not that either is easy of course.  Or even a reasonable expectation.<p>I wouldn't worry about stock price as you hopefully never have to sell a good income payer.  But if you are buying, at some point a good dividend payer will fall until it's cheap enough for a good return, ie wait for the next crash.  I think the dividend stocks are being sold off now because of uncertainty over tax rules in 2013 for dividends, and also since money has been chasing yield and made those stocks overbought.",1354950875

4891020,comment,4890481,4890481,24,0,cwilson,,,"When I think back to the days when I played Ultima Online (14 to 17 I believe), for whatever reason my fondest memory is a ""profession"" I picked up, which was that of a blacksmith. We're not talking a cookie cutter category I selected on character creation here, we're talking I happened to have a certain level in a skill that allowed me to repair my own armor and weapons, so I turned it into a public service. I'd stand around in the forge area of the most popular town, about 3 - 4 blocks from the bank in town (the most popular area in the town), and advertise that I could do repairs (generally resulting in a tip).<p>This required that another player literally GIVE me his or her items. As in, I could run off with them if I wanted. There was no trade window that allowed me to repair their items without actually taking them. They had to trust that I would give their items back after repairing them.<p>I found this absolutely fascinating (and still do) for multiple reasons:<p>1. Over time you built up a reputation of being trustworthy. At first people would only give a smith they didn't know crappy items, but as you became more trustworthy and well known they would start to hand over their rare items for repair. I was literally building a reputation in an online game, in a real community, for providing a quality service (think about the impact this likely had on a 14 year old, who at that time had no idea what having a job, or building a reputation, was like).<p>2. Items HAD to be repaired in UO, so this wasn't something players could get around (unless they wanted to train up that skill themselves, and you were limited on how many skills you could train to their max level at any given time). You simply had to trust a blacksmith in order to repair your items. After players came back to town after long sessions of dungeon crawling and killing monsters (in many cases because their armor was in need of repair), they would funnel back into town and the first stop was generally to get repairs.<p>3. For whatever reason everyone stuck to a tips based system. I don't remember a market rate at any time for repairs that players set as a community. It was just assumed you tipped your smith.<p>4. The better armor/weapons you personally wore while smithing, the more likely you'd get customers who had better weapons/armor, resulting in higher tips (because they likely had more money). It was my first experience with advertising and building a personal brand.<p>This is just a taste of why UO was such an amazing game and social experiment. It's a shame nothing has come close to recreating such an experience (EVE Online being an exception, but it still falls short in many ways).<p>If I had to pick a second fondest aspect of the game, I'd probably say Rune Books. You could ""mark"" runes in the game with a spell, which coded that rune with the location you were standing in when you marked it, which you could then place in a book. You could then travel back to that exact location at will, at the cost of a spell and its required reagents (hell, the reagents system was amazing as well!). Players made Rune Books of all the towns, dungeons, and crazy hidden locations (or their own homes, favorite shops, etc) for personal use, but also to sell so other players didn't have to make them on their own (as it would require a significant amount of traveling on foot to do so). I remember being very fond of my Rune Book collection.<p>What a game.",1354950658

Zapaang arose out of a personal need where we had items lying around that we dont necessarily want to sell but would give it to friends or neighbors if we knew they were looking for something similar. We werent keen on posting about it on Facebook and spam our friends with things that we have for sale as our work friends might not be so interested in my used diaper genie for sale. Neither did we want to post on craigslist and having to deal with people we dont trust.
Zapaang explores the idea of what if you had a way to list, share and invite people to view things that you know will be relevant to them. Zapaang banks on the trust factor by building on top of a users existing social circle on Facebook. Facebook groups is a logical extension to that group where a group of people with similar interests post messages relevant to that its members. We started off with a version of Zapaang where you can list, discover and interact with items posted by your facebook friends or shared with facebook groups you belong to. The app is available on the iPhone store and the Windows Phone marketplace. For more information you can visit http://zapaang.com",1354950534

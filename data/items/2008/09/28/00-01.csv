317294,comment,317160,317160,0,0,SapphireSun,,,"After spending 8 years not getting any sleep, I finally realized that I'm more efficient with real sleep. I finally wised up. In retrospect, my dumbest mistakes have mostly been due to being chronically sleep deprived.\n Amongst engineers and scientists, a lack of sleep is a point of pride. We feel like those stupid liberal arts majors are getting no real work done and that we're tired because we are. Whether the conjecture about liberal arts majors is correct, the sleep part is wrong. I'm so much more efficient now that I'm getting more sleep. I've been trying to get my friends to sleep more, but we'll see how that goes....",1222562983

317286,comment,317155,317241,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>Being neutral about gay marriage is like being neutral about evolution</i><p>What a strange analogy. Evolution is a natural phenomena, while marriage is a state-regulated union. There is a set of reasons apart from tradition why legal marriage exists, and very little in that set would apply with any frequency to ""gay marriage"". The most obvious reason, of course, is that the division of labor between the sexes is inevitably derivative of the constraints created by pregnancy.<p>Brin doesn't really argue beyond this,<p><i>we see this fundamentally as an issue of equality.</i><p>But this is an error.

The alternative would be to present an infinity of viewpoints on every topic one covers in any piece one writes.  At some point one has to exercise discretion on what gets included and what doesn't, on what gets covered in detail and what doesn't.  I don't think it's right or realistic to try to abdicate that part of one's journalistic responsibility.",1222561681

It's not my job to decide which of the different views on a topic I cover is ""correct"" or ""right.""  My job's to describe them and how they relate to one another and let the reader do his or her homework on which one they think is right.<p>Drew Curtis has a great chapter in his book in which he rails against the media's penchant for giving equal time to ""crazy people.""  He makes a great argument, but the problem is that it comes from an assumption that your readers are too lazy and dumb to make up their own minds about an issue, so we should be selective in how we treat different sides of an argument.

317268,comment,317057,317123,0,0,dhuck,,,"I have nothing against Mr. Perkins personally. I think he's a great investor - and he's undoubtedly a lot smarter than I am. I have nothing but respect for the man's accomplishments, I just take offense at how he chooses to spend his money. Now, granted, yes, it's absolutely none of my business at all. I would hate to be told how to spend my money, so it's hypocritical for me to judge him on how he spends his money.<p>But with that said, I just think it's a waste.<p>You can't moor a boat this size in a normal harbor (yet). And in a lot of ways, bigger isn't better (especially for a sailboat, as tlrobinson mentions below.) I read an article about a visitor on Larry Ellison's ship that said it was like walking in an empty mall. That's just how it feels - huge, imposing, but utterly empty.<p>I think it's hard for us to say if he gets the value out of his boat or not (and it's not our business anyway, true.) I speculate that he doesn't because I see this boat as just another conspicuous display of wealth intended to validate Mr. Perkins' ego. And if you can't feel secure about yourself without a big boat - then I really think you should reevaluate your priorities in life.<p>""Should everyone stop [displaying their wealth] because the brokers on Wall St made a couple of stupid bets?""<p>No, of course not. If we take away that - then what reason do you have to try to make it big?<p>The source of my ""hate"" of money is that I think people (especially Americans) think money is the answer to everything. To quote Blow - ""Money isn't real, it only seems like it is."" Over the long term, a big boat will not make you any happier than a smaller boat. Anything that you buy eventually will lose its luster. That Lambo? It'll feel awesome that first day, but then the second day - you're a little bit more used to it, and it loses a little value to you. By year 10, what is it worth to you?<p>I just feel that if people recognize this - that you eventually get used to all this stuff that you buy - than they wouldn't need to spend so much money on themselves. There are people starving in this world, dying of illnesses that could be treated, and Mr. Perkins is sitting in his empty mall of a boat. I personally feel that's immoral.<p>But he's free to do what he wants - and I'm free to take potshots at him from an internet forum. If he doesn't want to make this world a better place with his money (and honestly - he might be doing that as well, I probably am not giving him enough credit) - he's free to do that.<p>(Another important thing to consider is that this boat will be used to entertain hundreds of people, and not just for carrying around 12 guests. So it has many more uses then I am giving it credit for.)<p>laut: ""It isn't his fault that the financial system is a mess. Turn to politicans and voters for that.""<p>Anyone who demands greater and greater returns on their investments, at any cost - is the cause of this mess. Greed produces this demand. Poor people and rich people can both be guilty of being greedy, but it is people like Perkins and company that have the power because they hold the chips, and it is their demands that get heard over everyone else. Thus, the richer and greedier that you are - the more likely it is you that caused this mess.<p>And to clarify, I hope the boat doesn't sink with anyone on it. I don't wish that on anyone.",1222560341

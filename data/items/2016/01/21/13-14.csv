The  Big plans need to be future proofed, something you can still get utility from even if the big picture changes. Highways in tunnels under cities don&#x27;t fit that (railways are somewhat of a different story IMO).  An expressway that bypasses the city, maybe but a normal highway with exits, no way (IMO).

If the city was large relative to its size today (geographically) in the early 1900s odds are good it&#x27;s got acceptable to good transit.<p>The places which have mostly grown after the 1940s tend to have poorer transit as cars came to dominate.<p>Comparing what works in Switzerland with what works in the US doesn&#x27;t make that much sense, though.  There are plenty of stretches of railway in the western US that might be hundreds of miles between places big enough to warrant a substantial power station.  Which means that you&#x27;re going to have to pull hundreds of miles of high voltage lines (which aren&#x27;t free) in order to have a stationary power plant power the all-electric locomotive.

Since they&#x27;re only selectively enforcing laws that many people are breaking they can choose to enforce them on you arbitrarily.<p>For example the speed limit on a major highway in Ontario is 100km/h however they average speed is probably closer to 120km/h because the police are selective with the speed enforcement. This means they can pull over basically anyone based on arbitrary criteria - what kind of car they drive or what they look like.

Personally, the way I use Q-tips is to insert them from below the ear at a 45 degree angle, constantly rotating the Q-tip and then performing a swipe around the ear canal while keeping up the rotating motion (resembling the precession movement of a gyroscope). Using this technique, I never had any issues with pushing earwax towards the tympanum or irritating the ear canal. The advantages are less itching in the ear canal caused by ear wax, and having no visible crumbles of ear wax falling out of my ears. I seem to have the &quot;wet&quot; ear wax type.<p>It seems like this is a common and weird instance of problems that re-occur when medical professionals give advice to patients and the general public:<p>* Lack of insight into why people are exhibiting the behaviour. For me at least, the natural buildup of ear wax produces itching, and using Q-tips is a significant relief. In the re-occuring advice to the public by medical professionals this seems to be ignored.<p>* Lack of understanding of the importance of aesthetics. Yes, it might be natural to have large crumbs of ear wax visibly protruding from your ear canal, but that does not make it irrational to dislike how it looks. Ignorance of such social factors leads to &#x27;unexplained&#x27; lack of compliance with medical advice, which in turn leads to a decrease in the quality of doctor-patient relationship and ineffective public health interventions.<p>* Lack of interest in harm reduction approaches. For several decades articles like the OP have been published, seemingly with minor or no effect on actual practices. It might be more reasonable to accept that people are very keen on cleaning their ears, and to find strategies to reduce the potential harm while still letting people do what they want. Simple advice on  HOW to use a Q-tip without harming yourself (don&#x27;t push in too much, don&#x27;t push in straight if you really can&#x27;t do without it) might have more overall positive impact.",1453384237

Everyone can have the best seat in the house. The virtual capacity of the stadium is physically unbounded. The VR adds the atmosphere that watching the TV doesn&#x27;t provide.

However, I&#x27;m not at all concerned about the stock market. That has never influenced my decision to fund a company. My belief is that a strong company can weather a bear market.<p>I&#x27;m concerned with the current state of valuations - I enjoy giving investments to companies on the order of five figures or so each with the hope that they make something meaningfully impactful. I don&#x27;t necessarily look for them to become moonshot successful; a win can be much smaller than that. Developing incrementally impressive technology that effects change is also a win.<p>But valuations are so frothy right now that it&#x27;s difficult to tell the strong companies from the ones that won&#x27;t survive &quot;when the tide goes out.&quot; It all seems very clear in hindsight, but it&#x27;s hard to know right now, even moreso than usual. This is always very difficult, but the market for ideas has become somewhat &quot;congested.&quot;<p>There has been a flood of folks entering the &quot;startup game&quot; who seem to be planning for their IPO before they&#x27;ve even gotten a product off the ground. Again, anecdotally, I&#x27;m observing a noticeable increase in fraud among founders who are trying to raise money unscrupulously, especially with novice investors.<p>I don&#x27;t like to use the word bubble because I think it&#x27;s lazy analysis, but I do strongly believe valuations are in the beginning of a market correction. At the very least, I think there will be a higher bar for invested money to indicate a legitimate valuation instead of a loan.<p>I do think that there will still be plenty of capital ready to be given to companies, investors are just going to be more selective (read: cautious) about it, which may very well change the growth and success potential of certain more dubious business models in the valley.",1453383323

I started with React, and I&#x27;m now on ng2 and happy with it (apart from some hopefully soon fixed bugs).<p>Imho both are ok. What I did not like that much with React was that the virtual DOM did not play nice all the time (strange effects can happen if you place non VDOM aware widgets inside it) and if you not take special care (keys) then reconcilation can produce a messed up representation. These things seem less problematic in ng2.<p>An unexpected very pleasant surprise for me was using the dependency injection mechanism in ng2 - I did not expect it do be useful because I never used something like this before. But now if any sub-sub-subcomponent in my view needs access to a status I don&#x27;t need to pass it all the way down through unrelated components via props (like in React) but can directly inject it only in the using component. I also had good experiences with MVVM architecture from other projects with other frameworks, so I am happily using this approach also in ng2. For the model component I&#x27;m using service objects which are encapsulating the current state, exposing it through observables and are injected into the component (viewmodel) through DI. What I like here is that I can bind the view directly to the observables from the model with the help of async pipes and thereby get an auto-updating behavior with zero boilerplate code.<p>Apart from that there are obviously the major differences - angular has an inbuilt router, React not. But still I wouldn&#x27;t think of Angular2 as something highly opinionated, you still have lots of flexibility.<p>As I am a big fan of typescript a factor for me was also that ng2 is typescript-first and I don&#x27;t have to rely on possibly incomplete or 3rd party type definitions. But that might be more of a political factor, the basic typescript support for react is also good (it can even check the types of props in JSX - which currently not possible for ng2 templates) but many 3rd party libraries don&#x27;t seem to provide type definitions.",1453383231

One of their earliest open source releases was Libero - a code generator to generate state machines. The point being that they have spent a couple of decades on solutions based around minimising the sloc, and while a lot their output is in C, a large part of the code they write is not C, but code generators and input to code generators.<p>In terms of their techniques, a both the code generation and many of the other techniques they advocate are about reducing and isolating risk: Generate code so that you DRY things up and can focus on testin a smaller code base; split code into modules separated by process boundaries and message-passing, giving you smaller modules to test, boundaries across which you can add high availability (distribute message across multiple instances) or handle failures by queueing and so on.<p>And as much as I love &quot;scripting languages&quot; - almost all my code is Ruby these days - there are many areas still where C is necessary for performance. The approach advocated in this book fits neatly with that: Nothing stops you from interoperating with any language you want - the message passing creates nice boundaries to isolate components in whatever mix of languages you want.<p>But also keep in mind that they&#x27;ve been doing this for more than two decades. They have amassed a lot of tools and a lot of experience in doing C fast and right. It might very well be that the economic case for/against C or other languages would look very different to them if they were to start today without that experience.<p>That said: It also isn&#x27;t all about economy. I regularly reject job offers because it&#x27;s not what I want to do. If we all made all our decisions based on time being money, most of us would be in different jobs.",1453383172

At this time, these countries are Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.  Starting February 1, 2016, SoftLayer will implement network-wide blocking of these IP addresses.  Expansion of this policy will further prevent the use of SoftLayer services to interact with those countries.  This policy will help to implement the export compliance commitments detailed in SoftLayer’s agreements with its customers.\n\n  You can find a brief explanation of how SoftLayer will identify IP addresses from countries subject to U.S. trade and economic sanctions on this KnowledgeLayer article: http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/faq/softlayer-network-wide-ip-blocking\n\n  Need an Exception?\n\n  If you believe your planned interaction with U.S. sanctioned countries is consistent with applicable export compliance rules, you can request an exemption to the IP blocking policy by contacting exemptions@softlayer.com and providing details about why you believe you are eligible for an exception to this policy.   Be sure to explain the nature of your communications involving U.S. sanctioned countries and the regulatory basis for your belief that an exception is warranted.  Our team will then work closely with you to evaluate your situation.  Please note that requests received after January 23, 2016, may not be processed prior to effective date noted above.\n\n  Dedicated to Your Success.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/23/where-the-worlds-top-100000-websites-are-hosted-infographic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/23/where-the-worlds-top-10000...</a>",1453381607

Harder than it looks, but me and my other friend got 50 ideas each. Then over the next 2 days whittled it down to 5 ideas each to start work on. The 1 idea I am now concentrating on hits 19 of you points, and I am actually quite excited about it, especially as I will be the first power user, it scratches an itch for me.<p>I would like to see your list passed around some other successful people to see what they would add, and whether or not more items could be added, maybe including some negative items (ie if the idea hits this, minus a point from the score) . Then think about what the real number of points needed for a good idea should be. I am going to look back over my brainstorming list now and see how some of the other ideas score on you list.<p>Thanks for putting it together!",1453381315

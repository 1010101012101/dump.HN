I think most languages go through this.<p><satire>
My guess is that eventually there will be another golden boy and a whole new generation of programmers will swear that it is the best thing since the invention of the wheel while at the same time complaining of all the baggage and bad decisions made in Ruby/Rails and ridiculing anybody that still uses it. Meanwhile the Ruby/Rails developers will look and scratch their heads wondering what all the hate is about. After all, Ruby/Rails gets the job done even if it is not perfect and anybody that is a language fanboy does not have a brain. After all, a programming language is just a tool. A whole generation latter the cycle repeats itself with yet another golden boy language. Sigh! To be young and stupid. Those were the days.

2651216,comment,2647485,2649173,1,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Again, I saw nothing at your URL negative about Exxon.<p>Your claim that three energy industry executives make more money than all the climate science research is likely false:  A research grant in science to a research professor goes for about $500,000 a year.  The university grabs about 60% for 'overhead' (help support the English department, etc.).  The rest covers or helps cover the prof, travel, photocopying, lab equipment, grad students, etc.  Add up 100 such profs and have $50 million a year.<p>But nearly all the Fortune 500 CEOs are just hired managers and, surprisingly, are not so well paid if only because typically they don't last more then 5 years as CEO.  So, maybe they make $10 million a year, for a few years; then they don't go start again in the mail room and, instead, just retire.  After the taxes, considering how few years they were CEO and long they might continue to live, a guy who owns, say, 10 McDonald's can do better if only because he can keep his business for decades.<p>So, for your three CEOs you are up to maybe $30 million which is less than the $50 million for the profs.<p>Sure, a given CEO might some year cash in some stock options and make $50 million, but that's a one-time thing.<p>Instead of such salaries, the big bucks are from owning something not worth much and then making it valuable.  Why?  Because only a tiny fraction of the people can evaluate the tree that might grow from a seed or help such a seed grow to a tree.  E.g., relevant here on HN, there's hardly a single venture partner anywhere in the US who will even try to evaluate the chances of a particular project becoming another Google.  Instead, for any investment amount enough to support a few people for a few years, say, over $1 million, they will invest in something simple such as 'traction' and do so on the basis if the track record of 'traction'.  For 'another Google', they will be happy if it happened but will make no effort toward that goal.  So, entrepreneurs such as discussed on HN some hedge fund managers, especially J. Simons, can make much more.  On all of Wall Street, there is exactly one person who understands what Renaissance Technologies does and has good reason to know why it makes money:  Simons.  Period.<p>But, that some oil company executives are making money says nothing about global warming or really that Exxon is funding FUD.<p>A lot of the global warming hysteria is from stimulating the desire of people to have a religion.  With the major organized religions in decline, Communism, global warming, etc. can find some fertile ground.<p>There is also general paranoia such as made the morality plays popular going way back in the history of 'story telling'.<p>""All this said, though, perhaps the bigger question is:  what would convince you that global warming is a big problem and that it's being caused by people?""<p>Right, that's the bigger question.  The answer is simple and the same for global warming, climate change, dying of anthrax, having Yellowstone blow again and put a layer of ash 10 feet thick over much of the US, have the earth hit by an asteroid, etc.  Same for all of them:  Look for good data and good arguments, especially good science.<p>E.g., for the asteroids, yes, the various belts of asteroids are unstable so at any time a bump can cause an asteroid to leave the belt and head for earth.  Right.  So, for a fairly good first cut, dangerous asteroids will arrive like a Poisson process.  But we have a very good estimate of the arrival time:  The rate is less than once per 65 million years.  So, for the next few years, the probability is tiny.  And that's why I don't worry about asteroids.<p>For anthrax, we have good public health data and we understand anthrax.  So, for my life in the burbs, no worries, mate.<p>Etc.<p>For global warming and climate change, the data is total BS, and the science is worse.  So, flush it.  No worries, mate.<p>Easy enough.<p>Done.<p>For you, again, relax.",1308008964

In practice, I don't know anyone who does that. I'm sure for most it feels like a bit of a hack.

Launching an app equally long, etc). To the point where I actually had to jailbreak mine to get it into a usable state again.""<p>I used an iPhone 3G on iOS 4. It was bad. It was slow and unreliable. I'm not sure why they didn't lock it to iOS 3, other than the fact that Apple marches forward, with or without its user base. I guess maybe that's Apple's message to us.

Of course, you have to pay the rent, and you have to pay some kid to assemble it, you have to pay for insurance, etc...  but as a business owner, I'm not going to go with groupon unless I'm in a situation where I've overinvested in fixed costs.<p>I mean, renting buildings isn't like spinning up a cloud server;  Usually, you've gotta sign a multi-year lease, and usually you've gotta pay for expensive cooking equipment; equipment that costs you the same regardless of usage.<p>Employees are a little bit more flexible, but there is a training period.   New people provide negative productivity for a time, and if you don't give your old people enough hours, or if you jerk them around on what hours they work too much, your people who are good enough to get work elsewhere will do so.<p>Further, I think most valuations of groupon are assuming that groupon will provide some 'this deal only good during the less busy times'   solutions.  If  I'm paying all my fixed costs and the building and employees are idle, the marginal cost of another customer is not very much more than the cost of the food, and in this case, the cost of the food isn't much at all.  Heck, I know times in my business when I overbought capacity when it would have made sense to take a 75% price cut to move product and salvage something from the situation, rather than just paying for capacity I wasn't using.<p>Now, personally, I still think the groupon is massively over valued.  I'm just saying, it's not any more massively over valued than linkedin or facebook.   All of these companies are being evaluated in unrealistically favorable light;  I think if you shine that same light on groupon, it looks pretty goddamn good.<p>What I find scary about the groupon hate is that a lot of it seems to be because the founders cashed out early;  this means that cashing out early will be more difficult for founders the next time around.",1308007870

We have a few ideas, but both of us are pretty inexperienced, both technically and business wise.

The point is that becoming the fastest-growing company by revenue in history is not an independent accomplishment, because all it takes to do that is a large amount of money and a willingness to burn it. It <i>is</i> a measure of their ability to attract funding that can support spending, but not an independent measure of success, since, given sufficient funding, you can always buy revenue, e.g. by selling $100 bills for $50. To show that Groupon is more interesting than the money-burning scenario requires some metric other than revenue or revenue growth.",1308006926

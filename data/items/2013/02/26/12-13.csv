It wasn't devastating so much to my physical health as to my mental health. Sleeping too long is as bad as sleeping too short, not to mention going sleep in the morning for several days in a row. Sleeping properly really is essential for good physical and mental health, don't sacrifice it just to 'do more'.",1361883569

5285248,comment,5284826,5284826,1,0,42tree,,,"I found the following answer quite interesting:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404775/how-to-identify-web-crawler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8404775/how-to-identify-w...</a><p>""There are two general ways to detect robots and I would call them ""Polite/Passive"" and ""Aggressive"". Basically, you have to give your web site a psychological disorder.\nPolite<p>These are ways to politely tell crawlers that they shouldn't crawl your site and to limit how often you are crawled. Politeness is ensured through robots.txt file in which you specify which bots, if any, should be allowed to crawl your website and how often your website can be crawled. This assumes that the robot you're dealing with is polite.\nAggressive<p>Another way to keep bots off your site is to get aggressive.<p>User Agent<p>Some aggressive behavior includes (as previously mentioned by other users) the filtering of user-agent strings. This is probably the simplest, but also the least reliable way to detect if it's a user or not. A lot of bots tend to spoof user agents and some do it for legitimate reasons (i.e. they only want to crawl mobile content), while others simply don't want to be identified as bots. Even worse, some bots spoof legitimate/polite bot agents, such as the user agents of google, microsoft, lycos and other crawlers which are generally considered polite. Relying on the user agent can be helpful, but not by itself.<p>There are more aggressive ways to deal with robots that spoof user agents AND don't abide by your robots.txt file:<p>Bot Trap<p>I like to think of this as a ""Venus Fly Trap,"" and it basically punishes any bot that wants to play tricks with you.<p>A bot trap is probably the most effective way to find bots that don't adhere to your robots.txt file without actually impairing the usability of your website. Creating a bot trap ensures that only bots are captured and not real users. The basic way to do it is to setup a directory which you specifically mark as off limits in your robots.txt file, so any robot that is polite will not fall into the trap. The second thing you do is to place a ""hidden"" link from your website to the bot trap directory (this ensures that real users will never go there, since real users never click on invisible links). Finally, you ban any IP address that goes to the bot trap directory.<p>Here are some instructions on how to achieve this: Create a bot trap (or in your case: a PHP bot trap).<p>Note: of course, some bots are smart enough to read your robots.txt file, see all the directories which you've marked as ""off limits"" and STILL ignore your politeness settings (such as crawl rate and allowed bots). Those bots will probably not fall into your bot trap despite the fact that they are not polite.<p>Violent<p>I think this is actually too aggressive for the general audience (and general use), so if there are any kids under the age of 18, then please take them to another room!<p>You can make the bot trap ""violent"" by simply not specifying a robots.txt file. In this situation ANY BOT that crawls the hidden links will probably end up in the bot trap and you can ban all bots, period!<p>The reason this is not recommended is that you may actually want some bots to crawl your website (such as Google, Microsoft or other bots for site indexing). Allowing your website to be politely crawled by the bots from Google, Microsoft, Lycos, etc. will ensure that your site gets indexed and it shows up when people search for it on their favorite search engine.<p>Self Destructive<p>Yet another way to limits what bots can crawl on your website, is to serve CAPTCHAs or other challenges which a bot cannot solve. This comes at an expense of your users and I would think that anything which makes your website less usable (such as a CAPTCHA) is ""self destructive."" This, of course, will not actually block the bot from repeatedly trying to crawl your website, it will simply make your website very uninteresting to them. There are ways to ""get around"" the CAPTCHAs, but they're difficult to implement so I'm not going to delve into this too much.\nConclusion<p>For your purposes, probably the best way to deal with bots is to employ a combination of the above mentioned strategies:<p><pre><code>    Filter user agents.\n    Setup a bot trap (the violent one).\n</code></pre>\nCatch all the bots that go into the violent bot trap and simply black-list their IPs (but don't block them). This way you will still get the ""benefits"" of being crawled by bots, but you will not have to pay to check the IP addresses that are black-listed due to going to your bot trap.""",1361883470

To create a show of force and make our government seem formidable.   Why are there so many ceremonies involving soldiers, government officials, marching, etc.  Simply to put on a show and create the impression of solemnity, gravity, and importance.<p>Governments must continually act to keep the power they have achieved.  They do this mostly through propaganda and PR efforts.  Every white gloved soldier in a ceremony is a PR stunt.  Every wood paneled room, dramatic monument, motorcade, marble building, podium, flag and seal are part of the PR show.<p>The world is full of greedy people who seek power over others.  Whether it's an ambitious Carmen Ortiz or an up-and-coming young congressman or a mild mannered traffic cop.  Each seeks to control others as a <i>very</i> significant portion of his/her motivation and life's goal.<p>Most people who do startups just want to build something and work with interesting technology and so we often forget just what government is.  We must wake up and realize that it's about control and force, and now and then the victim of this control and excess is a fellow hacker and we start to take it seriously for a few minutes before we forget about it again.  Don't assume that you won't be the target, don't adopt that conservative worldview.",1361882322

It doesn't cost anything to have a new card (if you don't carry a balance), so it's useful to have a backup.<p>30 cards sounds like someone with a serious debt problem.  Separate credit/debit cards are a really useful distinction -- in particular, I can maintain much higher security for my debit cards (and not use them online); a credit card purchase can be disputed without the money already being <i>gone from your account</i>.  But they're certainly dangerous (given how people tend to rationalize spending money they don't have...), and <i>carrying a balance</i> on a credit card almost certainly means you're doing something wrong.<p>They make it really easy to live beyond your means; I got burned by that a couple of years out of college, clawed my way back out of debt over a few years (fortunately with reliable income and low expenses!) and haven't made the same mistake again.",1361880409

I stick to my opinions no matter if they are unpopular.<p>I know what you mean, but apart from Portal 2 the rest does not really qualify from development from scratch (even Portal 2 is dubious on that aspect, since it takes all the mecanisms from the previous games and expands on it). While I love what they do as a distributor and very much appreciate what they do for Linux support, as a pure game developer they fall short of expectations, and they have not done anything very original for a while. For a company with a ""flat organization"" that is somehow disappointing.",1361880338

It was for total registered lifters at all levels, including youth, juniors, seniors and masters. When a sport is popular in a country, it's played at all ages.<p>Meanwhile the USA had, until Crossfit, about 3,000 lifters. Not a very big pool to draw from.<p>You correctly point out that state funding for Olympic sports collapsed some time back and that this removed the quasi-professional pathway.<p>For a similar reason, few athletes in the anglosphere who is naturally strong and power will go into weightlifting. They're playing gridiron or rugby. Those sports are popular and have lucrative professional leagues.",1361880310

I'd prefer there were no DRM, and as makomk says above, it causes problems to others that I don't see. I just meant that that one particular argument of ""no ownership in X years"" didn't hold much water with me personally.<p>This being said, I have bought System Shock 2 twice and lost it both times (once stolen, I think) and today I have been playing a pirated version (hooray for the new texture mods).

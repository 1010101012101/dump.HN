No saturation point in sight.  From a discovery and find point of view, saturation point for that long since pasted.

One of his famous success stories was ICQ which was funded by him and sold for $287 million dollars in June 1998.<p>I read an article about him in the Israeli ""The Marker"", which points out a few interesting things about the entrepreneur - funder relationship.<p>I've translated a saying of his that was quoted in the article:<p>""When I hear a pitch by an entrepreneur I look for a few things in them. First, they have to be very talented. I'm not interested in good or great entrepreneurs. I want them excellent. They have to be nice people, since some investments don't ripe in early stages. I always tell my wife that in case the investment fails in early stages, at least we gave a ""scholarship"" to a good guy and not to some idiot. Moreover, they have to be focused on the arena I like which is the internet. If they meet those criterias, there is a good chance I will invest in them. What exactly they are doing is less important. Business plans are a wonderful part of science-fiction. They are developed for people who love sausages and don't know what are they made of. How can one conduct a 'due diligence' on something that is only in his mind.""<p>I would love to hear your thoughts,
Tomer.",1223468114

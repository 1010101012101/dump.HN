7154931,comment,7153671,7153851,4,0,mikeash,,,"The thing is, the &quot;PC market&quot; is rather artificially defined to be that market in which Microsoft dominates.<p>If you take the generic concept of &quot;personal computer&quot;, what people were using those for five or ten years ago, people are now often using smartphones and tablets. Due to how the market is segmented for analysis, this isn&#x27;t counted against Microsoft, but the money doesn&#x27;t care how we segment it. The PC, in the long term, is going to be a niche market. Not today, not tomorrow, but in 5, 10, 20 years, a Microsoft that owns the entire PC market and little else will be a tiny, broken Microsoft.<p>If we count tablets in with PCs, then MS&#x27;s &quot;PC&quot; monopoly is already gone. Tablets are selling around 1/3rd of what PCs are selling, so that gives MS a 75% share.<p>If we count smartphones in with PCs, then PCs almost disappear. Smartphones make up about 60% of the combined smartphone+tablet+PC market, with tablets making up another 10%, giving PCs 30%.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d point out how PCs are still very popular, how MS still makes tons of money off them, how they&#x27;re not going anywhere soon, etc. And I completely agree. But in the long term, it&#x27;s not going to last, not in the form it exists now. I&#x27;m sure MS could do decently well for a very long time as they are, but they will stagnate and they will eventually shrink if they do so. They might remain powerful, but not to anywhere near the same degree.<p>For your Wal-Mart analogy, imagine if Wal-Mart totally owned retail sales, but &quot;retail&quot; was defined to exclude all online sales, and Amazon was selling 3x as much stuff as Wal-Mart once you counted online.

Or they hired from colleges and sheep dipped people in the same thinking.  People from startups and industry don&#x27;t last long there, and definitely don&#x27;t rise in management.<p>The reason startup or industry people don&#x27;t rise in Microsoft is that they are rejected as not matching the 1990s way of doing things.<p>Examples:  Their UI innovation was in WPF because someone forgot to tell them that UI dev now happens on web pages and iPhone.

It&#x27;s useful sometimes, but people often use it in places where it is not a great idea.  Here&#x27;s why:<p>1) If you are in the mindset of &quot;I want a single file which is both a library and a program,&quot; how will you name it?  Files to import must end with &quot;.py&quot; and follow C-style name rules, so cannot start with a number cannot contain hyphens.  This leads many people to break conventions when naming their programs, because on Unix, hyphens are conventional in program names but underscores are not (count the examples of each in /usr/bin on any system).  And naming your program something like &quot;2to3&quot; is impractical if you want it to be importable also.<p>2) It is unclear where to install files which are both programs and libraries.  Programs usually go in some sort of &quot;bin&quot; directory (again, on Unix systems), but libraries do not.  Where do you put a file which is both?<p>3) Sometimes the __name__ == &#x27;__main__&#x27; trick is used to include unit tests within a module.  That&#x27;s not bad, but consider using Python&#x27;s excellent doctest feature instead, which often serves the same need but in a richer way.",1391135395

One poorly optimised loop using jQuery.each or Array.prototype.forEach  unless you&#x27;re writing a heavily JS intensive application isn&#x27;t really going to make a noticable difference to performance. The average Joe developing a Wordpress theme with a slideshow and a few other little pieces of JS probably won&#x27;t see any lag nor benchmark said theme. However, it does all add up the more you use Javascript for, you eventually get to a point where the milliseconds of delays and spikes in RAM usage add up and cause delays/lag.<p>I think it&#x27;s just important to be aware of the alternatives and trade-offs using certain methods and knowing when to a 3 line method in place of a one-liner piece of jQuery. On a site I am currently working on I am using jQuery.each, I am modifying elements in the page using jQuery.width and all kinds of other things I normally would advise against in a large application. But the site I am building which is a Wordpress theme uses such little amounts of Javascript that using a more optimal method wouldn&#x27;t really make much of a different interaction and latency wise.<p>My point was more-so that there are developers out there using poorer methods even in large-scale applications because that&#x27;s the only way they know how to do it. Just being aware of what you can do in Javascript can be a beautiful thing and even save your hide in a situation where the page is freezing up when you scroll (an event I recently witnessed occur and had to fix).<p>In time I do believe native methods and certain implementations will get better.

Things like sentiment detection, NLP, etc are still too infant in my opinion -- this is baked into the premise of the idea as a whole... We still NEED humans to write good translations - it seems unreasonable to start at the assumption that you will get high-quality output from the imperfect machine process that you are trying to improve (if that makes sense).<p>I think at best, you will START with bad style, at worst, people will essentially re-translate the chunks to make more sense anyway, and you&#x27;re left with the hodge-podge.<p>- If your method WAS suited for medium/long-form, I would suggest adding another tier of worker-bee: the proof-reader. Allow worker bees to apply/become proof readers, and create multiple proofs for large documents. These workers would have qualified for longer-form proofing and possibly editing. A possible increase to the relative pay of the proof-readers (as they are even more closely linked to your revenue and customer satisfaction, and are doing more work to boot), and providing multiple or a combined proof to the customer (up-charge for this) would be a great addition to what you already offer. This will probably do wonders for quality control, and will remove the problem above (I think, to the extent humanly possible). This also gives the people who work with you chance for improvement, chance to build a personal brand, and a chance to take pride in their work (and maybe even build personal/business relationships/trust that benefit the company).<p>- Why not play in all the vertical space that you guys are in? Part of my version of this service dictates a flat rate for a certain length, and a CLEAR indication that that kind of service is for people with small blurbs to translate. Some companies only need to translate small blurbs (disconnected paragraphs, tag lines, etc), and could benefit immensely and constantly (if you make a brochure for your company, or even an earnings report, etc, you would need this service EVERY month/year, for example). I don&#x27;t think you would have to make too many structural changes to accommodate such a group of potential customers.<p>- I have not operated a system like this at scale, so all my suggestions are largely baseless (keep that in mind please)<p>Oh and my idea was to rid the world of &quot;Engrish&quot;, especially at the corporate level.",1391134379

His arguments on such grounds are not cogent. (Another quote in the Wiki article shows that Rickover also disliked nuclear power because of its relationship to nuclear weapons, which is more reasonable, although still not sufficient to justify getting rid of nuclear power IMO.)<p>His comments on the US Navy&#x27;s particular philosophy, which worked for a military organization but would not work for civilian power companies, are valid as far as they go. However, to me that&#x27;s a bug, not a feature. To see why, consider the following sketch of an alternate history: in the mid-1970&#x27;s, having realized that OPEC is not going to play nice any more and therefore foreign oil is not a good basis on which to run the US economy, the US government makes nuclear power a national priority on national security grounds (much as France did). Knowing that existing reactor designs require skilled operators and strict procedures to ensure safety, the government institutes licensing similar to what is done with professionals in various fields, such as engineers, whose activities can, if done incorrectly, pose significant risk to the public. The US Navy program is used as a model, but the military-style aspects of it are adjusted to something more appropriate for a commercial endeavor.<p>Result: in the alternate 2014, the US imports no oil (except possibly from Canada), the majority of base load electricity comes from nuclear power plants, coal mines are all shut down and their sites cleaned up to serve as ski resorts, offshore oil drilling is a thing of the past (so no Deepwater Horizon spill), and the US can just leave the Middle East alone (so no special treatment of Saudi Arabia, probably no 9/11, no invasion of Iraq).",1391133762

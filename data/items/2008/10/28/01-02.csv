345910,comment,345476,345493,0,0,bokonist,,,"There's nothing inherently wrong with debt-backed securities.  They can be a very healthy part of an economy.  Variations of debt backed securities have been around for centuries.<p>The real problem is the maturity mismatching, which in this case was fraudulent.<p>Here's how it works:<p>I put cash in a money market fund. The fund promises me that it only invests my money in very safe short term debt,  It promises I can get my money back at any time, on demand.  The Sentinel money market fund - to pick a random example - promised that 50% of its investments were overnight loans.<p>The trouble is that Sentinel lied.  It turned out that 80% of their holdings were in long term bonds, and only 8% were in overnight loans.  The average maturity date of their holdings was an astounding <i>32 years</i>.  Other money market funds had their money invested in securitized student loans, mortgages, corporate bonds etc.<p>When you mismatch maturities like this, it becomes a license to print money.  The fund accepts my investment.  It then loans my dollar out to someone who wants a mortgage.  That person pays the builders of the home, who then deposit the money back in the money market fund.  The money market fund then loans the money back out again.  The cycle keeps repeating, like a great big money printing machine.<p>This manufacturing of money is what caused gold prices, oil prices, stock prices, and real estate prices to take off over the past five years.    More dollars floating around chasing the same quantity of assets causes prices to rise.  It also explains the rise in consumer debt.  With high inflation and low interest rates, borrowing lots of money is rational.  This also explains why the financial industry was responsible for 50% of all American corporate profits in 2006.<p>At some point, some event causes depositors in the money market fund to get spooked. Perhaps information comes out that a money market fund has too many defaulting loans.  The CFO of a VC backed startup is counting on that money to meet payroll in the next few months.  He can't afford to accept any risk, nor any delays in redemption.  So he decides to withdraw from the fund immediately.  Except the CFO of many other companies have the same idea.  The money market fund does not actually have the money to pay them.  All the fund has is a bunch of IOU's saying, ""we will pay you back with interest in 30 years.""  But the CFO's need the money now, not 30 years.  The money market fund is forced to liquidate the IOU's for pennies on the dollars.  Everyone loses their shirt.  Worse, many businesses were counting on the low interest rates created by maturity mismatching.  As people withdraw from money funds, the loan market dries up, and debt financed businesses start to go bankrupt.<p>This hardly is some ""new economic phenomenon"".  Maturity mismatching has been at the heart of every single systematic financial crisis in the history of the Anglo-American financial system.  The most notorious case was the Great Depression.<p>In the current crisis, the last step - the liquidation of the money market funds - has not happened.  That's because Ben Bernanke is a student of the great depression, and recognized what was happening.  When the bank run on the money markets began a few months ago, he decided to guarantee all the money market funds with full faith and credit of the government.  He was basically saying, ""We know that financial industry has been counterfeiting for decades.  Unfortunately, now everyone is holding these counterfeit notes, including good, solid businesses.  So instead of considering these bills counterfeit and allowing to a financial apocalypse, we're just going to consider these notes legitimate legal tender.""",1225158584

I am not one to take security lightly, and salted Sha256 is not taking security lightly. I am not sure what kind of apps you write, but for 99% of the apps in the world, salted Sha256 is plenty secure. If it was as big of a problem as you said it would be highly discouraged, which it is not. The leading authentication solution in rails uses Sha1. Regardless, if you are extra paranoid, you can use any type of encryption you want with authgasm. So the argument is moot. Lastly, authgasm is not about promoting sha256, its about a style of authentication in rails. The method of encryption is just an option, which is what the crypto_provider option is all about.

345886,comment,345226,345849,0,0,mkn,,,"Your reply seems to be a spot-on agreement with my post, except that you don't realize it. Your choice of analogy is particularly amusing in that, right now, if you'd had your money under your mattress, you'd be better off than if you'd invested in one of these highly-leveraged and over-exposed financial vehicles that I'd mentioned. Mattressing one's money may have been the best idea of them all for a large class of investors.<p>That aside, the proper way to make the analogy you're making is not to compare investing in a CDS against putting money in or under your mattress, but rather to compare it with putting it in a certificate of deposit in your locally-owned bank or loaning it to a locally-owned business. Either of these would very likely have less return and a higher risk for you. However, you would be less susceptible to a global default cascade like the one that is happening now.<p>The reason that <i>...your own data center [would] be better...</i> isn't that it's less likely to go down, but rather that, if everybody has their own data center, the chances of a <i>global</i> blackout go down drastically. This is precisely the analogue I was pointing out. If banks had stayed <i>non-optimum</i> and <i>local</i>, then (arguably) we would not be facing a (potential) global economic meltdown.<p>You may argue (rightly) that if you pursue these localist strategies when everyone else is pursuing these more profitable consolidated strategies, which <i>carry this systemic risk of catastrophic failure</i>, that you'd succumb to competition from others. This is the point of asking for regulation in the market, and (possibly) the case for asking for it here. At some point, almost by definition, the cloud computing market will commoditize. When that happens, the only way to cut costs will be do do without redundancy, if that is a legally available option.<p>The underlying problem is that people discount the cost/benefit of events that happen in the distant future, and the global catastrophes in these two systems always seems distant.<p>Finally, one may object that if redundancy is such a good idea, then it will happen naturally and never be eroded by market forces. In this case, then, there can really be no objection to legislation on the matter, because everyone will naturally comply anyways.",1225157396

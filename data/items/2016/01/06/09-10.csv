In order to copyright something you need it to be a particular fixed text (or image, or recording). There is no such text for web APIs. You can come up with multiple texts (or images) all describing the exact same API. That is not the case for &quot;plain&quot; APIs. Plain APIs -- like all code -- do have a fixed form. But no fixed form means no copyright.<p>You&#x27;re joking, isn&#x27;t?<p>> The bits of text comprising the names of JSON fields, while fixed, are too short (and lack the necessary structure) to be considered &quot;a work&quot; for copyright purposes.<p>What are you talking about?\nDo you really know what an API is and how web services are defined?

Is it just that the copyright holder eventually released a GPL version of the code while Google chose to stick with their own implementation?

Also 1991 Linux was probably illegal and Wine definitely is. These are just off the top  of my head, just search for &quot;open source implementation of&quot; on Bing, chances are most of the results are about illegal projects, including open source implementation of various standards: standards don&#x27;t necessarily come with a universal license grant, at least for patents (see e.g. the H.264 situation).

That&#x27;s what you have to live with as a programmer and striking the balance is delicate business, but luckily it&#x27;s enough that you only need to find the balance in the average.<p>Then again, it&#x27;s all about shit.

E.g. patents (artificial), real estate, infrastructure (both natural).<p>In the case of infrastructure, the answer is relatively simple - nationalize it (or strictly regulate it), and offer it to multiple <i>operators</i> at fair (and equal) prices. This is what is happening already in e.g. Europe (for electricity and mobile networks). It can even work for other scenarios - for example, when the Greeks were forced to &quot;privatize&quot; their airports, they didn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> privatize them, they just rented them out for a number of years - that way, whenever the lease is up for renewal, there is still a market happening, so it&#x27;s more competitive than ownership/monopoly.<p>For patents/copyright, it&#x27;s considerably more complex; I think we can all agree that current regimes in e.g. copyright law and software patents feature way too long monopolies, but it&#x27;s not so clear if that&#x27;s the case in other fields, especially farmacy.<p>For real estate, it&#x27;s hard to come up with <i>any</i> solutions. As long as there&#x27;s a benefit to living close to other successful people, rents/prices in high-prodoctivity areas will keep on rising. Taxes could help (e.g. by making buy-to-let less profitable), but they won&#x27;t solve the underlying issue. I&#x27;m hoping that eventually technology will improve to such an extent that there will be no advantage in living in the cities (i.e. remote working/communications technology or much faster transport).<p>Are there any other worrying examples of rent-seeking that you had in mind?",1452072563

The only difference is that before (as Google did) you could make two arguments: 1) that APIs aren&#x27;t copyrightable to begin with, and 2) if they are, then you&#x27;re making fair use of them. Now only option 2 exists (with the caveat of the ruling serving as a precedent, as other commenters say).<p>Also, copyrighted APIs are <i>only</i> &quot;language-level&quot; APIs (or just APIs as we&#x27;ve always called them) -- <i>not</i> web APIs (or protocols, as we used to call them), simply because web APIs lack other prerequisites to be copyrightable.<p>To the question of fair use. There are several fair use defenses, but two apply to the industry in cases like this: 1/ non-profit use, 2/ use for the sake of compatibility (to prevent vendor lock-in). AFAIK, <i>all</i> third-party implementations of APIs happen to be one or the other (or both). Android is neither -- it is for profit and it is not compatible with Java programs. More than that: it wasn&#x27;t even done to prevent vendor lock-in. So even if Google loses on the fair-use case, chances are that the defense still holds for all other cases of third-party implementation. Unlike the claims made by Google&#x27;s PR, this ruling&#x27;s effect on the industry are at worst tiny, and most likely nil.",1452071896

The main point to consider is that new technologies augment the possibilities - outright <i>replacement</i> is actually the unusual case, because there&#x27;s always some odd reason to have the old stuff around.<p>Artistic workflows definitely rank among those reasons; they do tend towards Taylorist efficiency when the artist doesn&#x27;t want a restriction, but desire to be a maximally efficient artist in every aspect can lead to a deep probing of your motivations for doing any art to begin with, instead of just jotting down what the piece is supposed to be. So most artists will take on at least one technical restriction of some kind, consciously or no. That restriction subsequently guides and shapes everything else they&#x27;re doing.<p>So for people who want their focus to actually be built on the limitations of analog, they need analog. Period. And that isn&#x27;t most people, since there are many other ways to go about setting limitations, and what is usually needed when it&#x27;s called for is an <i>indication</i> of analog, not its every nuance and imperfection. But like a car enthusiast who can enjoy old and inefficient designs, someone who really cares about analog audio will want to have the experience of the real stuff, despite the painstaking elements of doing so.<p>edit: And I welcome digital imitations. The newest VA synths really capture the imperfections of old stuff in a way I haven&#x27;t heard from previous attempts, and I want to use them for that.

The difference is accountability <i>within the profession</i>. If a doctor starts doling out tons of prescription opiates, an auditing system is in place (Many levels in fact - either within the state, nationally via the DEA, by someone arrested who will rat the doctor out in exchange for lenient terms, or by a pharmacist who has seen one too many &quot;Oxycodone 30 take as needed&quot; pass through his shop.)<p>Programmers (as individuals) can&#x27;t be ethically audited, but what we <i>can</i> do is regulate the data which is allowed to be collected. You regulate it like any other industry. Sigma-Aldrich is a corporate company that sells pharmaceutical grade precusors. I was dating a girl who was doing a post-doc in o-chem, in her office waiting to finish up something, and flipped through their catalog. I saw a precursor that was heavily flagged by the DEA which could be used to synthesize massive amounts of a recreational drug. Curious, I asked her the procedure for procurement, and she delineated it. In short, she could get it with a sign-off from the PI and a few other things fairly easily [she would never do that, she&#x27;s far too ethical - but her PI was famous enough that a request on his letterhead with &quot;Veritas&quot; on it would have been enough] but there&#x27;s a chain of custody and auditing system in that just like there is with doctors who are issued DEA numbers. If I call up S-A and ask for the same chemical not only would I be laughed off the phone, but they&#x27;d likely submit my information to the DEA to flag me for further investigation.<p>What am I getting at? You can&#x27;t regulate people, but you can regulate systems. If that precursor was ordered and that drug happened to pop-up, the DEA could easily call up any of the suppliers of those precursors and figure out when it was dispensed fairly easily. <i>We need to regulate any institution that collects data in the same way.</i> When it&#x27;s at a point where the institution is large enough to collect information at a level like that, issue compliance terms. In the same way publicly traded companies have to release financial information to the SEC and comply with numerous reporting terms (look at EDGAR to see how extensive it is), open up another branch of the government that is in charge of regulating the companies that collect data.

NK got their first fission several years ago. So it is about time.<p>It is frequently suggested that NK explosions are [half]failures because of low yields. Well, making low yield fission or fusion bomb is actually much harder then a powerful one and historically the pinnacle of nukes have been the low yield &quot;neutron&quot; ones. The low yield ones are also much more scarier as a weapon because they require lower threshold of craziness to use - i.e. sending a 1MT ballistic missile on a city even Kim III may be not ready to order while 0.5KT is just like that Chinese port explosion several month ago.<p>Anyway, giving the amount of tech assistance NK got in 199x from former Soviet researchers, one can only blame NK economy on why it has been taking them so long to join the club.",1452071068

I don&#x27;t need to be an employee and go to work, just to be allowed to do what I already want and am doing. Does this make sense to you?\nIn the end I&#x27;m pursuing employment to get paid, you know, and there are only degrees of alignment between a person&#x27;s current aspirations and the stuff you&#x27;re going to be paid for. So, what people are trying to argue here is the balance between the time you are required to sacrifice in order to earn enough for a half-decent living and the free-will time in which your actions are motivated otherwise.\nLike you once said - it&#x27;s nice to be in a position where people can&#x27;t exert leverage on you.\nThere certainly is a social and political push to this balance towards devoting yourself more to the company&#x27;s agenda.",1452071048

The online component has been criminalized due to the argument that internet demand will spur abuse in the real world - I see the logic of that.<p>However, the true wins will come by doing real-world police work, educating parents and children on how to protect themselves and what are the potential offender profiles (hint: not guys in an ice cream van). They will come on a diplomatic level by negotiating better laws in countries where such materials are produced (Japan was a recent success AFAIK) and where sexual tourism is rife.<p>Finally, those individuals that haven&#x27;t abused anyone should receive support from a mental health specialist if they come forward and admit to their urges, like in e.g Germany.<p>I have the feeling that this is a taboo subject, that is not discussed frankly in most societies. The authorities focus mostly on harsh punishments instead of prevention through education and mental health treatment.<p>Thinking about what happens on tor is mostly a reactive policy that doesn&#x27;t do much to treat the causes.",1452070984

A personal assistant is someone that you know, that you vet, that you can gauge the skills and reliability of, and that you can hold genuinely accountable.  And you are comparing hiring this person on a full time basis to an ad hoc and in many cases inferior &quot;assistant&quot; who is only available for a fraction of that time with no guarantee or indication of quality ahead of time.<p>And not just that, but only extremely rich people have truly personal assistants, and if they can afford them then they probably don&#x27;t need this apparently mass-marketed service. Most &quot;personal assistants&quot; are hired by a company that the said &quot;rich person&quot; is involved with, making it a company expense. And why would a company with the resources to hire a personal assistant (and likely other flexible personnel) go to some $100/hr service when they have their own employees to service their general needs and who can be responsible for tracking down and hiring the specialists who actually do those tasks.<p>I mean, seriously. You could hire a full-time minion to go out and find and pay specialist deliverers, caterers, etc. for a similar or smaller cost than it takes to hire someone unknown and unreliable to do it ad hoc for a quarter of that time, given that 40hr/month estimate.",1452070873

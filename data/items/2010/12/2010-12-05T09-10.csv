Large corporations purposely site different activities in different jurisdictions to take advantage of each jurisdiction's benefits and avoid each jurisdiction's pitfalls, as the company's self-interest dictates. Why can't Assange try to engage in the same sort of jurisdictional arbitrage, living in one country, running servers in another, accepting mail in a third, etc.?

Yes, it will, because at least some aspects of AI are limited by performance right now.<p>2. Are memristors particularly well suited to modeling the brain? Though there are small scale similarities, I think this is akin to saying a mechanical computer based on gears turning is uniquely suited to doing CAD for automobiles, or a wooden keyboard helps with furniture design.<p>The brain consists of a huge number of slow processing elements. Electronic computers consist of orders of magnitude fewer processing elements running orders of magnitude faster. Even if we approach AI from neuron-level simulations, we're better off using the ~1000 floating point op per second per transistor to simulate a set of neurons serially than to waste 5 or 10 memristors per neuron and enormous interconnect bandwidth to try to build an electronic analogue of the brain.<p>Edit: You quoted one thing I said, but you cut the crucial word ""pure"". If memristors are uniquely suited to AI, then this is not a ""pure consequence of performance improvements"". When I say that I mean that performance is fungible.

The difference is magical and 5 years later it still amazes me. At a check-up one year later I had 20/20 vision, and haven't noticed any degradation since then. I never particularly noticed the halo effect at night. I did have very dry eyes for a year or so, but nothing that artificial tears couldn't fix.<p>That's not to say the procedure is without risks; but it worked out very well for me.<p>The reason for the dry eyes, I was told, is that the cut in the cornea kills some nerves, reducing sensitivity, so you don't _know_ your eyes are dry (and hence don't blink enough) until they are _really_ dry. The nerves eventually grow back.<p>I stare at computer screens for 12+ hours a day, and I do get dry and irritated eyes -- but I think that has more to do with the staring at computer screens, and not blinking enough, than the Lasik.<p>I had my operation done in Colombia, a country with strong expertise in Lasik (the microkeratome, the instrument used to cut a flap in the cornea, was developed in Colombia). At my one-year-post-op checkup (in New Zealand) the doctor recognized the name of my Colombian surgeon from journal articles. At the time the operation cost US$1000 (for both eyes), less than 20% of what it would have cost back home, and probably better quality.",1291540700

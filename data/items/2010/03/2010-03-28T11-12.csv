(The basic theory is ""Birds of a feather flock together"": if most of your friends are losers, it is probably net-beneficial to the business to assume you are a loser, if most of our friends are solid debt-paying responsible citizens, it is probably net-beneficial to the business to assume you are a solid debt-paying responsible citizen.)<p>I think this would be so effective (prices risk appropriately, far cheaper to maintain than the current reporting infrastructure since folks helpfully update the social graph for you) you'd almost <i>have</i> to illegalize it.

This is one of the reasons I really like the Java platform, because of the choices. I can choose to run Java on Windows, Linux, OSX or what ever operating system. I can choose if I want to use Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, Geronimo or what ever server best suites my needs. I can choose my language; Java, Jython, JRuby, Groovy, Scala, Clojure etc. All these languages run on the JVM.<p>If I was still building desktop apps, like I did in the 90's, I'd probably still be using Microsoft tools.

First, figure out what exactly she wants to do/make/play with—then pick the best tool for the job.<p>If she just wants to make web pages, set her up with some webspace and then, after she's gotten HTML and CSS down, show her that she can ""make things happen"" using PHP and Javascript.<p>If she wants to make a game, I would personally recommend starting off not with any raw-coding environment at all. Why? Kids don't generally <i>like</i> designing game <i>mechanics</i>—and that's what they're tasked with if they have to turn a general-purpose programming environment—or even a multimedia environment like Flash—into a game engine. If they say they want to make a game, chances are what they <i>want</i> to do is just to re-use ideas they've seen in games they've already played, but with different content assets and ""individual-asset mechanics"" (i.e. new power-ups, weapons, etc.)<p>My own recommendation, then, is <i>RPG Maker</i>, partly because it's where I got my own start in logical systems-based thinking, but also because it has a nice, gradually-sloped learning curve, beginning with pure level design, and then transitioning into scripting as the need arises, before finally peaking with the limited ability to rewrite the game engine in the scripting language itself (with just enough chafing to make them crave a better tool.) The only catch is that it isn't free—RMXP is $60USD, as far as I'm aware.",1269775032
1224451,comment,1224407,1224407,0,0,Jermey128,,,"I remember trying to learn C when I was twelve. The strange errors the compiler  generated were way above my head, because the system was more complicated than I could understand at the time. Eventually, when I was 13 or 14, I learned a bit of VB, but not enough to be really useful. I think, however, that someone might have a decent chance of learning python, especially since you don't have boilerplate code. Also, if you are working directly with the interpreter you always know that it was the last thing you did that caused the error, so you don't have to hunt around (think attention span).",1269775018

Squeak is great for learning programming; It is very easy to produce little games and things like this.
Python is great if you want to use a lot of libraries and still want a clean programming language.
Php is fine for web pages - if she loves to build them it is great, but the other languages are better suited for learning to programm.
Bottom Line: I would go with squeak!",1269774969

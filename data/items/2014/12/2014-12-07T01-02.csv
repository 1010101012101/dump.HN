Irvin Yalom is a truly talented writer and a very talented psychotherapist; in this book (and, really, in his work), he focuses on how he and his patients grapple with death.  I have a copy on my shelf that I read from time to time, and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Loves-Executioner-Other-Tales-Psychotherapy/dp/0465020119"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Loves-Executioner-Other-Tales-Psychoth...</a>",1417917545

8710955,comment,8710448,8710448,0,0,stephenhuey,,,"2 of my friends--one is Nigerian and the other is not but grew up there--left great positions in other countries to go work for Tony Elumelu&#x27;s foundation (they left the Rockefeller Foundation and a foundation in Boston).  Both of them have always been passionate about seeing Nigeria progress and I was so happy for them a few years ago when they each got the opportunity to return there to work for such a promising foundation.  I&#x27;ve seen the jokes in this page, and yes, even within Nigeria people laugh about all sorts of other hardships of daily life there as a way of coping with them, but Tony is one of many people I know of who are defying pessimism and truly making a difference.  So many average citizens there already manage to pull off industrious plans despite roadblocks we don&#x27;t have to deal with in countries like the USA, so with opportunities like this I&#x27;m hoping to see even more successes.  With half the number of people of the USA and more than double the population of the next largest African country, Nigeria&#x27;s next generation is well poised to take the world by surprise.",1417917450

8710951,comment,8710561,8710561,0,0,AshleysBrain,,,"Open source/free/libre software is a great idea, but a lot of JS code out there is nontrivial, useful and incredibly narrow in scope. Compare it to a build script: it may be relatively complex, yet so specific to its particular use case that it is not really useful to anyone to open source it. I think this is much the case with Javascript on the web. Some websites may have genuinely useful nontrivial code full of their own domains and site-specific classes and IDs, and it&#x27;s not worth anything to anyone else, but it qualifies as nontrivial nonfree and now deserves to be blocked!<p>Defining &quot;nontrivial&quot; is probably impossible, and the attempt looks a bit clumsy: making a network request apparently instantly qualifies you as non-trivial, even though your browser probably made a bunch of network requests for static content just to load the page. Want to load a sound to play with the Web Audio API? You now need to open source your Javascript code and provide a correct license to avoid blocking. The given description also means use of obj[prop] (often used to mimic a hashmap, thereby arbitrarily disqualifying certain data structures) or loading an external script via <script src=&quot;...&quot;></script> (thereby disqualifying certain kinds of optimisation or organisation) count you as &quot;nontrivial&quot;.<p>How can this ever be objectively determined?

8710902,comment,8710299,8710299,0,0,natejenkins,,,"Although I&#x27;m a physicist group theory was one of my favorite undergraduate courses.  At the risk of sounding like an idiot to a mathematician, I will attempt to explain one of the cooler parts of an extremely cool subject.  There are finite and infinite groups.  An example of the former is the modulo3 addition operator over the elements [0,1,2].  The identity element is 0, 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 0+2=2.  The inverse of 0 is 0, of 1 is 2 (1 + 2 mod 3 = 0) and of 2 is 1 (2 + 1 mod 3 = 0).  Addition is also associative so we have that covered.  An example of an infinite group would be addition over the integers.<p>Anyway, focusing on finite groups, mathematicians spent many years trying to classify finite groups into different types.  For instance, every finite group of prime length is a cyclic group (<a href=""http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Group_of_prime_order"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Group_of_prime_order</a>).  This is already very cool since it implies that for each prime number, there is exactly one group with that number of elements, anything that looks like another group can be mapped 1:1 with the cyclic group.<p>There are many other types of finite groups and the vast majority (this is an understatement) can be classified as one type or another.  At some point mathematicians realized that although there are an infinite number of finite groups, maybe they could classify all finite groups into one type or another and set about doing so, with the caveat that there is a finite number of exceptions to this classification, and these exceptions are called sporadic groups (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_group</a>).<p>Here is where my knowledge is the fuzziest but also where things get awesome.  Using a form of magic only available to mathematicians, it was predicted that an extremely large sporadic group existed somewhere out there, avoiding classification into one of the standard group types.  I am guessing that certain hints to its existence were popping up here and there but have no idea as to what those hints might look like.  In physics, particles have been predicted before (and at least one time using group theory: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_%28physics%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_Way_%28physics%29</a>), these predictions usually stem from attempting to explain experimental results.  Mathematics lacks these experimental results so these sorts of predictions are all the more impressive.<p>Anyway, back to this extremely large group.  It was given the name the Monster Group and an upper bound was given as to its size.  If I recall correctly (I cannot find a citation), this upper bound was considered the largest useful number of all time (any child can name a number larger than a number given to them, but using it in some novel way is not so easy).  Eventually the Monster Group was found, fulfilling the prediction, and its size given as 808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000,000,000, far below the upper bound but still quite large nonetheless (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_group</a>).<p>Also, mathematicians succeeded in classifying finite groups (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple...</a>), it only took several hundred articles and tens of thousands of pages to do so.",1417915835

Beware the rabbit hole.

Back in the 90&#x27;s, many if not most programmers would have passionately agreed with every word of this.  Today, for younger programmers who take open-source for granted... it just seems like the incoherent ramblings of that old uncle who rants about Obama at every family gathering.<p>At any rate, where this is coming from would make a lot more sense if you&#x27;d come up in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, and remembered what it was like before open-source gained a serious foothold.",1417914284

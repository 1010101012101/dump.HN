But nevertheless, people still click to my site and start clicking on my ads.<p>The later 3 days were relevant posts. For eg. if it was a topic about bastketball, i post about basketball and then add a link to my site as my forum signature.<p>No. it wasn't performed ethically. I mean, come on, look at the first 3 days. Those posts are totally irrelevant.",1180579346

25565,comment,25459,25459,0,0,staunch,,,"Thanks to them for being so transparent. I'm definitely interested in seeing what they create and I'm rooting for them. I feel like they're borderline on about 6 of ""18 mistakes"" though, so I'm a bit skeptical. Upgraded office, slow launch, hiring lots of people pre-launch, devs with a C#/Java background, QA people, product managers, desktop software? Perhaps they'll handle it all well, but those are some red flags to me.

For example, I'd like to see an example of the messages (relevant and irrelevant), I'd like the address to your web site (I understand why you didn't post it, but it would be useful, perhaps private email?) and I'd like to see the numbers.<p>I do not understand how you make the connection between the data, and your conclusion.  Never-the-less, there is an interesting thesis in your measurements.  ",1180578058

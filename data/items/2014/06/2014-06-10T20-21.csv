Whereas the dumb, unvalidated metrics seem to be actually making inroads in education.<p>To some extent tech benefits from there being giant piles of money everywhere, which limits how much leverage stupid employers have over their employees (where legal, they try to use noncompetes to counteract that effect).<p>An interesting feature of this decision, though, is that it interprets the &quot;right to education&quot; in the state Constitution as creating an enforceable, quite broad right, rather than merely a general principle: any government policy that stands in the way of students receiving an effective education is (according to this holding) unconstitutional. If that stands as precedent, students may have another way to combat poorly designed metrics: such metrics might also be unconstitutional.

(Edit: other than the fact that the exponent should be unsigned int :/)<p>The whole point of encapsulation is to be able to write data types that have invariants other than those offered by the machine-level types. If you want a type <i>T</i> that satisfies the predicate<p><pre><code>    âˆ€nâˆˆT: âˆƒkâˆˆN: n = 2^k\n</code></pre>\nthen you write a type that only provides operations that maintain the constraint. In this case, for instance, construction from <i>k</i> and multiplication by another <i>T</i>. As I said, some languages like C++ do also allow things such as compile-time conversion of an unconstrained constant integer into a power-of-two integer, with a compile error if the constraint isn&#x27;t satisfied, but in my opinion that&#x27;s mostly syntactic sugar. Would be nice if you could simply write, say,<p><pre><code>    type intPowerOfTwo = unsigned int where âˆ€intPowerOfTwo n: âˆƒunsigned int k: n = 2^k\n</code></pre>\nbut what about the unsigned int operations, such as addition, that do not maintain the invariant? Should the type system include a general theorem prover that can deduce which operations are allowed?<p>However, I understand this was simply an example and do agree that expressive and powerful type systems are certainly a very useful tool. C++ template metaprogramming (pretty much computing with types as values) is very impressive even if horribly <i>ad hoc</i> and the concepts  feature (constrained templates), if ever actually implemented, will make all kinds of things easier.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_%28C%2B%2B%29</a><p><a href=""https://isocpp.org/blog/2013/02/concepts-lite-constraining-templates-with-predicates-andrew-sutton-bjarne-s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://isocpp.org/blog/2013/02/concepts-lite-constraining-t...</a>",1402433197

7875162,comment,7867634,7874875,2,0,pron,,,"I think your cause and effect are reversed. I think that the biggest difference between &quot;pragmatic&quot; languages and research languages, is that pragmatic languages are driven by actual need, and with consideration for current practices and workflow. The language features are designed around that. Research languages, OTOH, are made to explore an idea, or conduct an experiment, usually made to answer the question &quot;how would these language features affect development&quot; (they could increase productivity, reduce bugs, improve performance etc). The result of the experiment are very valuable, and the successful, proven, ideas are then integrated into pragmatic languages. It is very rare that a research language achieves mainstream adoption. In fact, I would argue that if it does, it&#x27;s failed as a research language because its widespread adoption probably means it wasn&#x27;t adventurous enough.<p>Haskell is a prime example of a rather adventurous research language. It&#x27;s an experiment that&#x27;s been run for about 15 years now. First the early steps, and now people are experimenting with real world applicability. I&#x27;m really interested in the results, so I&#x27;d really like more people to run the experiment, but I have no doubt that Haskell itself will never gain widespread adoption. If it does its job well, its best ideas will be copied by other, non-research languages.<p>Now, I&#x27;m certainly not saying that Haskellers don&#x27;t work on serious projects. But it is a fact that Haskell is much more common in academia than it is in the industry. Again, <i>this is intentional</i>. Haskell is meant to venture into unchartered territory and explore. Some of the things it aims to do work well and might be adopted in the industry, and others don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t. If Haskell teaches us even a few things, then it is a great success. What I don&#x27;t like is that some Haskellers deny the true purpose of the language, and instead of examining it as researchers should do, they preach it.",1402432606

You can think of the entire haxl run (program) as an AST that is given to the execution. It expands as much of the AST as possible (anything that&#x27;s not IO), and anywhere it needs IO it enqueues those requests to be scheduled. Once it&#x27;s explored as much as possible, it aggressively schedules the IO (deduping, batching, and overlapping the calls). Once it all comes back, it unblocks the AST where it can, and repeats the process.<p>This isn&#x27;t necessarily the optimal scheduling (as you point out, unblocking each part of the tree as each result comes in might be better).

For instance, from an object&#x27;s frame of reference, it is always at rest.<p>(This is also why old sci-fi about a drive that can push you to FTL if you get &quot;close&quot; to the speed of light is gibberish. Your velocity is always zero relative to yourself. You can never get close to <i>c</i> because you can&#x27;t even get clos<i>er</i> to <i>c</i>.

You know how people are doing impressive hyperrealistic paintings like this:<p><a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pictured-eloy-morales-stunning-self-portraits-3166130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/pictured-eloy-morale...</a><p>These are amazing, until you realize he&#x27;s getting the fidelity he needs by making the paintings huge, then taking pictures of them from farther away. Can&#x27;t tell a painting&#x27;s size on the internet, so it looks super realistic until you see it in person.  Next, if you look carefully at that first photo, he&#x27;s looking off in the distance at....a laptop most likely, or a projection.  If you look in youtube or at various artist&#x27;s blogs you start to catch them with a laptop sitting right there, or an ipad stuck to their easel with the image right on it.<p>If you check out these hyperrealists (they don&#x27;t say photo &#x27;cause that&#x27;s a bad word) you can sometimes catch them with a laptop, image on it squared off, sometimes even zoomed in.<p>What modern &quot;Vermeers&quot; are doing is they&#x27;re using computers and screen technology to get very exacting details and color harmony using combinations of large size projections (you can see Eloy&#x27;s pre-drawn lines), gridded images, and zooming on a computer screen.  So the awesome thing about Tim&#x27;s Vermeer is he shows that if someone&#x27;s using enough technology to make art then they become just a mechanical photo printer.  Might as well be a photographer.<p>Here&#x27;s another artist you can see copying a photo:<p><a href=""http://www.littleobservationist.com/2013/05/22/artist-interview-francoise-nielly/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.littleobservationist.com/2013/05/22/artist-interv...</a><p>FranÃ§oise Nielly at least interprets them, but I bet if you looked she probably uses the hell out of computers at first to get studies right.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is many artists use technology like this, and many of them get into this &quot;cheating&quot; when they run into disabilities or time constraints.  The problem isn&#x27;t the technology though, it&#x27;s whether they pretend they don&#x27;t use any, which is what a lot of these hyperrealists try to get away with.  But, take an artist like Richard Schmid and you find he started using a computer after a major back injury and he freely admits he uses photos and computers to do painting.<p>What I liked about Tim&#x27;s Vermeer is it&#x27;s at least proof that someone with zero talent can use technology to create an equivalent to what&#x27;s considered a masterpiece.  David Hockney&#x27;s book also demonstrates that much of the art we consider painted using pure skill is actually just clever uses of technology to do photo reproductions with oil paint.",1402430597

It doesn&#x27;t matter than VCRuntime will continue to be versioned since each compiler will provide its own startup and EH (they already do). In fact, I wonder if this is a move to begin officially supporting alternate compilers.

I&#x27;m not going to be drafting briefs on an iPad any time soon, nor are CPA&#x27;s going to be poring over spreadsheets on iPads. On the other hand, the <i>proportion</i> of overall technology users that need to do these things is shrinking because of all the new users coming online who use technology for consumer and social media purposes. E.g. there are far more kids using tablets and phones, who never used a desktop computer before, than there are CPA&#x27;s hunkered down in front of giant Excel spreadsheets. So the latter is almost certainly true.<p>A good point of comparison is the 3D graphics market. Initially, it was primarily used for CAD, etc. But consumer 3D exploded, and because it was such a bigger market, all the R&D effort migrated in that direction. Workstation users still exist today, as many as ever did, but now they use re-purposed consumer hardware.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the same thing happens to people who use desktop and laptop computers. I imagine I&#x27;ll still be drafting briefs on my Mac 20 years from now, but my Mac will probably be re-purposed mobile technology.",1414587246

8526848,comment,8522471,8524024,0,0,pluma,,,"I&#x27;m using React. My server-side rendering is essentially `React.renderComponentToString(App(data))`. The only difference between how I invoke my app on the server vs on the client is that instead of `React.renderComponent` I use `React.renderComponentToString`. On the client, React just uses the pre-rendered HTML and binds itself to that without re-rendering a single DOM node.<p>All my scripts are in `package.json`. I don&#x27;t use Grunt or Gulp. If I want to re-bundle my client, I invoke a script that essentially does `browserify -g uglifyify lib/browser.js > dist/main.min.js`. My JSX build script and the bundler script are automatically invoked by a watcher.<p>This[0] is my entire build script and the only reason it&#x27;s verbose is because I like to be able to execute each task separately if I want to.<p>The only problem with React is that it is <i>only</i> a view library. It only does components. The blessed solution is a Flux-like architecture as implemented by Fluxxor or Reflux, but you can integrate React into nearly anything you already have. I like the immutable/unidirectional approach React and Flux share and ended up writing my own library[1] because there were things I didn&#x27;t like about the existing Flux implementations, but you don&#x27;t have to do that.<p>I have to admit that Flux has a steep learning curve. And if you&#x27;ve never dealt with immutability before it can really melt your brain. But I don&#x27;t see how Meteor is any easier to pick up, especially considering that it comes with its own entirely separate ecosystem (the only non-node library I use in my React app is an XHR-wrapper that replaces `request` on the client).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/pluma/61a1639906e188be8423"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/pluma/61a1639906e188be8423</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/foss-haas/flox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/foss-haas/flox</a>",1414586744

Like today, frosty morning with clear blue sky when sun comes through a window and illuminates the room I can&#x27;t resist lay on the couch and read some physical fiction book in calm environment, it&#x27;s quite pleasing. On the other hand, reading from ebook/tablet/desktop gives more interactive capabilities, I can get translation of some words, create bookmark, I can do search within book or on the internet etc., so it&#x27;s more convenient for technical stuff or when I&#x27;m trying to improve language skills. So both ways are interesting, and I sure hope physical books won&#x27;t die out.",1414586638

I&#x27;m looking to see if they have &quot;A calendar of dinners, with 615 recipes&quot; by Marion Harris Neil. Where would you suppose this book would be?<p>If I go to &quot;eBooks and Texts&quot; I&#x27;m simply met with a wall of collections, none of which are subject area organized, is it under Microfilm, or Canadian Libraries? Boston Library Consortium? Who knows? I&#x27;ll never find it by browsing and the way books are collected is pretty much useless. Unless I <i>know</i> there&#x27;s a copy under &quot;Canadian Libraries&quot; I&#x27;ll probably not find it.<p>Sure I can search for it, &quot;A calendar of dinners&quot; gives me 3 results! Turns out it&#x27;s buried under the following Archives:<p>&quot;Toronto Public Library&quot;, &quot;The Library of Congress&quot;, &quot;Cornell University Library&quot;. Notice that none of these are the crumbtrail I used to find it the first time on accident (Canadian Libraries)!<p>How about Omni Magazine? Is it a &quot;Text&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure, even today. I <i>do</i> know if I go to texts and search all texts for &quot;Omni&quot; I get it back. But it&#x27;s part of &quot;The Magazine Rack&quot; and &quot;Additional Collections&quot; which I still have not figured out how to just navigate to.<p>These are just texts, video, audio and other media types are similarly hard to navigate and find stuff. There&#x27;s little pleasure in browsing archive because if you find something, it&#x27;ll be by accident, not because you navigated to some pocket of cool stuff.<p>Good luck seeing what SF books they have and browsing it. That&#x27;s actually a collection I&#x27;d care about.<p>I also like old radio shows, and those are scatter shot all over the site. Unless somebody basically just uploaded an entire series at once, good luck piecing it together.<p>Right now, about the only way I know something is on archive.org is because the person who uploaded the item mentions it on a podcast or something.<p>I&#x27;m almost tempted to just start a meta-website of some sort to start organizing stuff I care about to that other people like me can find it.<p>It&#x27;s kind of a mess, and it&#x27;s given me a lot more respect for what librarians have largely solved in the physical world.",1414584342

2933418,comment,2931670,2933027,1,0,mbreese,,,"We had a <i>really</i> bad storm a few years back when my first kid was only about 3-4 months old. That house was at the low-point for the block, so water would pool in our backyard when there was a lot of rain (and the city has horrible storm sewers). Our house has a nice basement with a great drainage system that keeps it dry - so long as the sump pump can run. The rain was horrible: ~5-6 inches overnight. There was also a tornado warning, so we were in the basement for most of the storm.<p>Then the power went out.<p>Now, I had installed a battery backup sump-pump six months earlier, so that was able to keep up for a while. Our cell service also went in and out as the power outage was very large and our service at home was spotty (and the towers were over loaded). The only way for us to get ahold of family for help was through the land-line. I still keep at least one plugged in phone (non-cordless), just for this reason. Because of the land-line I was able to get my father-in-law to bring over a generator to power my sump-pump for the next day or so until our power was restored. Our basement had almost no water damage, mainly because we kept a land-line.",1314511128

They should use the tools that we have had at our disposal since the beginnings of law.<p>Restraining orders put due burden on the complainant, preventing frivolous complaints clogging our legal system, generating a barrier in which there need be noteworthy substance to the claim.

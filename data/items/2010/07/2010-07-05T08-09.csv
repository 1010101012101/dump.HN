Its too easy to get stuck on.<p>You are right. It has nothing at all to do with duplication or how easy it is. One of technology's greatest and most subtle tricks is the elimination of scarcity. Its not that I can take one for myself (no matter how easy or hard it might be), its that when I do, I don't take yours. It up-ends the economic apple cart in a way that is very non-intuitive and difficult for the human mind to grasp via ""common sense"".<p>Its easy to comprehend a lower and lower marginal cost per unit but once that cost reaches the zero limit, it seems that the formulas that our current economy depend on become undefined.<p>Technology doesn't invalidate the rights of owners/creators, it forces us to completely reevaluate what ownership means.

Not very surprising.<p>Not to say that they are wrong. But I think the main reason is piracy. Windows has been so popular in China and Eastern Europe primarily because pirated copies of the OS could run on a variety of hardware. Apple OS is designed to run on a rather limited set of hardware. This is also coupled with generally a easier way to download pirated version s of Windows software vs. Mac OS X versions of the same software.<p>The large availability of Windows then creates an environment for a home grown software market that runs on Windows only, which in turn make Windows even more desirable.<p>A third factor is perhaps the design. Apple products cost a lot more,  it seems, because Apple feels their applications have a much better designed UI. It is true, and I am not arguing with that. But that UI is designed to appeal to American and Western tastes and preferences. Or, rather, Americans and West Europeans would pay a lot more for a well designed UI vs an an with equivalent functionally but without a polished UI. In other words, they are happy running Office in Windows and using Windows' file manager vs paying more to run the same version of Office and using Mac OS X file manager on Apple hardware and software.",1278318604

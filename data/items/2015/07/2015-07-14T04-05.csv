9882969,comment,9878779,9882446,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"Adding log messages to code is a good thing.  Every complex system needs a way to get visibility into it, and logs are a great way to do that.<p>I currently work on Hadoop, and pretty much every project in the Hadoop ecosystem has a huge number of log statements.  Most of them are turned off at any given time for performance reasons, but when it&#x27;s really necessary, we can turn them on.<p>I can see how having a source-code patching system would avoid the overhead of having an &quot;if&quot; statement to check if the log message was enabled.  But what are you going to do when the library changes and your patch gets out of date?  Having debuggability built-in to the library, rather than available as a 3rd-party add-on, is a feature, not a bug.  Hadoop also supports changing the log level at runtime, and it seems like this source code patching system does not.  So while this is a very clever system and may have some specific use-cases where it&#x27;s useful, I think log levels are a better way to go in most cases.",1436849727

It seems to me to be prudent advice (of course, I&#x27;ve been in companies going through layoffs more than once).<p>Despite best efforts on everybody&#x27;s part, sometimes (I might be tempted to say &quot;often&quot; wrt startups) your job dries up.  Even if it&#x27;s obvious that the company was in trouble when you look back, for a variety of reasons you are never going to be given any kind of notice that things are not going to continue as they were.<p>Sometimes companies are very forward thinking and plan well.  In that case they let you go while there is still money left to pay a severence.  Sometimes they grind the company into the dust and there just isn&#x27;t anything left.  Often the business people are hoping beyond hope for a miracle to happen and when it doesn&#x27;t there isn&#x27;t any money that can be earmarked for severance.  As pointed out, the law allows companies a fair amount of leeway here.<p>Don&#x27;t leave it up to your employer to look after you.  Make a plan.  What am I going to do if I loose my job tomorrow?

Sometimes a form submission has a lot of state around it. Sometimes its result has a major effect on the state of the application of which it&#x27;s a part.

A ton of the UIKit APIs are naturally stateful, so you end up having to work around them in weird ways. Animation is particularly hard when your view controllers are pure. The solution I opted for was to instead create a unidirectional data flow and just &quot;refresh&quot; the state of the VC every time it gets passed different data. This way, you get most of the benefits of one-way data flow and the state of your VCs is (somewhat) pure, but you can easily drop down and use the UIKit APIs as needed.",1436848476

There are so many problems we are ignoring and the biggest which ansible brought up is the battery & cost. Could you charge your battery faster you can fill up your tank with fuel? Yes I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s improving every year but there&#x27;s going to be a lot of time that will be required. There are so many other economic unknowns during this time. What if gas became so abundant and cheap due to continued oversupply from some determined group of oil producing countries hell bent on making sure there&#x27;s a market for their black gold? What if we improved and lowered the cost of extracting oil deep deep below the earth and run into an ocean size worth of supply? What if car technology improves suddenly that burning fuel becomes extremely efficient that batteries can&#x27;t match? What if somebody comes up with a new type of fuel concoction that you could put into any old used car and get crazy mileage?<p>If we do arrive at a point where everybody is producing electric cars, wouldn&#x27;t there still be an interest in buying out existing gas stations and turn them into super charging stations where you can just drive your car through a tunnel and come out the other end with batteries fully charged? Or would battery become so crazy good that you charge it overnight and it lasts for deacades (you gonna put a mini nuclear reactor in your car?)? Maybe it will be possible to just subscribe to some power station in the orbit that charges your battery constantly wirelessly. I&#x27;d love to see that happen but the time it will take to get all of these things right is quite long and a lot of things can change during that time.<p>I hope you are right, I really look forward to that day when we can say the hell with relying on oppressing people (creating some very angry people that are willing to blow themselves up to make a point) in countries where their leaders get all of our dollars in exchange for that sweet sweet black gold.",1436848168

There&#x27;s a startup opportunity for someone to do a moderate-cost presentation system that&#x27;s installed in conference rooms, hotels, and such that Just Works. Lighting control should be automated as well; if someone is projecting something, the lighting should be automatically adjusted for that.<p>And automate HVAC control properly, too. Put a temp/humidity/CO/CO2 sensor in the return air duct, and a motion detector in the room, and tie them into the HVAC controls.  All conference rooms and college classrooms should have this, because the people load varies enormously from hour to hour.  (As a room fills up, the temperature goes up and the CO2 content in the return air goes up. This tells the HVAC system to not only feed in more cold air, but to use less recirculated air and more outside air to bring the CO2 level down. This eliminates &quot;stuffiness&quot;.  If the CO level goes up, someone is smoking, fan speeds must rise and dampers dump the return air outside.  When the room is empty, do one last air change, then drop to minimum HVAC levels and turn off almost all the lights.)<p>You can buy all this from Honeywell or Johnson Controls, but it&#x27;s not well marketed, costs too much, and requires too much engineering during installation.

The same effect could be reproduced with 2.5 mi of ethernet cables, except it&#x27;s wireless. This is definitely nothing new. You still need a connection to the Internet at the other endpoint. How this secures you, I&#x27;m not sure. Also these radio&#x27;s are line-of-sight and the antenna is directional. You could effectively follow the direction the radio is pointing at and find the 2nd radio installation.<p>From my perspective, this is a useless tool. It <i>physically</i> secures your computer. Plus ProxyHam is extraneous, these radio&#x27;s work with minimal configuration. ProxyHam sounds more like a wireless broadband radio installer than a privacy device.",1436846976

As a result, it&#x27;s pretty darn happy with imperative programming, although it has its own limits.<p>(As an aside (Did I mention that I once worked in the same building as Dijkstra, although I never took a class from him.), I find it very amusing that the article has the sentence &quot;<i>There are rules for concurrency, procedures, jumps, and pointers.</i>&quot; although neither it nor the linked &quot;Branch&quot; article actually describe Knuth&#x27;s revelation of Hoare&#x27;s axioms for goto.)",1436846786

Got my MSc in Oceanography, had some basic programming experience (built basic websites for beer money, some light scientific programming), but not much.  Decided I liked the analytics more than the rest of science, and got a job at a SaaS company as a Data Analyst.  Really started falling in love with programming quickly there, and did the following:
- took online courses like crazy (often waking up early to get some in before work, and more on evenings/weekends when possible)
- always took on the most technical tasks at work, where I&#x27;d get to write as much Python/R/SQL as possible
- started a coding club at work, great for group learning and motivation<p>After ~2 years of this I had gotten myself to a point where I could legitimately work as a Software Developer, and got a new job as one (at the same company).  Stayed in my area of expertise, data science/analytics, but as a developer instead of an analyst.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest codeacademy, though.  Maybe it&#x27;s changed since I tried it, but my experience was that they introduced you to a bunch of syntax, but left out most of the fundamentals of how computer science and how to structure programs.

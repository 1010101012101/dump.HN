In fact I have prepared hundreds of tax returns and am currently defending dozens of innocent Swiss bank accounts from the greedy clutches of the IRS.  </STFU, Phil>  But I digress.<p>Here are some scenarios.<p>1.  You really truly have zero income.<p>In that case file an income tax return.  You do not have a filing obligation but do it anyway.  The IRS has a three year window to audit you.  This time starts from the moment you file a tax return.  So file the tax return and get the clock ticking.<p>This is a ""stick the pacifier in the baby's mouth"" theory of tax returns.  The IRS will get noisy and send you letters asking why there is a gap in the sequence of filing tax returns.  Prevent that.<p>Since the 3 year clock doesn't start until you file a tax return, imagine 7 years from now when you are a Bloated Plutocrat the IRS comes to audit you.  They say ""Hey, what about 2010?  No tax return!  We gotcha!""  You say ""But I didn't earn anything in 2010.""  They say ""Prove it.""  You say, ""Meh, I threw away all my paperwork for 2010 because I asked about electronic filing of financial records on HN and I got a comment back that said to never save anything.""<p>You.  Are.  Dead.<p>Memo to all personnel:  file the tax return, even if you lived on the beach and ate abalone you caught all by yourself and walked around naked.<p>2.  You earned money but not a lot, so you don't owe any tax.<p>This is the scenario where you make a couple of thousand dollars, but below whatever the personal exemption + standard deduction is for that year.  Even if you fully report everything, you won't owe any tax.<p>Again, file the damn tax return.  It starts the clock running on the 3 year audit window.  It prevents you attempting to reconstruct the past if the IRS does come back at you later.<p>This is especially true if you have a 1099 in any amount.  You will get dunning letters from the IRS.<p>So do it.<p>3.  You earn some money but you have deductible expenses and other losses that mean you owe no tax.<p>You can predict what I'm going to say.  File.  Start the clock running.  Get your deductible expenses and losses documented.<p>4.  Backing up a step.<p>I have handled audits where people have reported small amounts of income on their tax returns and the audit is triggered on a simple, common-sense question from the IRS computers:  ""Well, how did he eat and pay rent?""<p>Be prepared to document that you drew down from savings.  It will work and work well as a defense on the audit.<p>5.  I am assuming your startup is not incorporated.<p>There you are.  Have at it.  Question time!  Hit me with some.",1285975366

Let's say current dependency ratio is 6 to 4: 6 people supported by 4 people's production. No matter what way you dice it, on average everybody is getting 4/10 of the average person's wealth production. At a later time, the dependency ratio may get worse; let's say it's 8 people supported by 2. Still, everybody needs to get by on average with 2/10 of the average person's production. Whether this is done by taxing current production, or because of a share of ownership of production via capital saved earlier, it doesn't change the fact that there's only so much wealth to go around amongst all the people.<p>Of course, productivity is increasing over time, so it's not like everybody is going to starve. But if anything, using a tax on current production to fund current dependents is more flexible than relying on capital ownership to fund future dependents (who will become ""current dependents"" in the future). If that 8/10 people own enough capital that they really try to put the squeeze on the 2/10 people creating wealth, that productive minority will revolt. With taxes, a political solution can be found.",1285975261

Financial literacy is a huge problem for a country that's supposed to be the richest in the world. How do we teach people the importance of personal finance management or change their spending habits? We teach all sorts of things in school except this.<p>Personally, I have been on a campaign for the last 9 months to teach people about the importance of planning, budgeting and saving. It's been difficult convincing people that they should think about their future. Even when I'm sitting down at the kitchen table face to face, it is difficult to establish the reasoning why they should care in the first place.<p>There are 4 types of people I encounter with the most:<p>1. I don't know how to take care of my finances and I don't care about my future.<p>2.  I do know that it is important, but everything is going to be okay even I remain ignorant.<p>3. I don't know, but I would like to learn more, but don't know how.<p>4. I know some, I think I have a good idea, but still want to learn more, but don't have somebody to turn to.<p>The common problem between all of them:<p>1. Most people don't know WHY they should care about their personal finance.<p>2. Most people don't know where to get trust worthy information to help them or have access to professionals.<p>I have been trying to solve these problems with one family at a time.

About 2% of people with HSV-1 infection -- but not HSV-2 -- have genital herpes.<p>""Our findings are consistent with previous reports that genital herpes caused by HSV-1 may be increasing in the United States, as in other developed countries,"" Xu and colleagues note.<p>The researchers warn that the herpes virus that causes cold sores may one day become a more important cause of genital herpes.

1749149,comment,1746832,1746832,0,0,kyro,,,"So, recently, as I started pulling loans out for school and creating budgets, I went on the look for a money management service and tried out Wesabe among a few others. Mint ultimately won, and I'll tell you why, from my personal opinion as a user. Maybe it might help somebody somewhere.<p>A) Design<p>Perhaps the biggest selling point for me was how polished Mint was in comparison to Wesabe. It felt professional. I felt I could trust Mint with my personal financial data. Wesabe seemed unfinished, rough around the edges. Sure, it played more to my irrational mind, but I just felt more comfortable using Mint. Just hook in my various accounts, let me create a budget, and do the rest for me, which is what Mint did. I was guided through the profile filling process, and there was a strangely human quality about Mint -- as if it were my own personal accountant.<p>So the first thing I learned was that a good design and user experience can be very effective in developing trust within a potential user for your service. Second was that lots of time should go into capturing a user's attention upon first laying eyes on your app, placing guides along the way, etc, ensuring initial and continual engagement.<p>B) iPhone App<p>At the time, Wesabe didn't have a native iPhone app (I don't think they ever did come out with one). They had a webapp, but it wasn't good enough for me, especially when Mint had a native app. This played a bigger role than I thought it would. Having a native app just feels better. Just the feeling of launching the app is rewarding. I don't know about you, but I really try to avoid using webapps in mobile Safari as much as possible; they tend not to be as polished and snappy.<p>So, if your app and users create the need for a mobile interface, don't settle for webapp.<p>C) Focus (Personal/Community in this case)<p>Wesabe seemed to have a communal element, which I really didn't care for. Mint came across as a more walled-off made-only-for-me personal assistant, and I liked that feeling. I didn't want to share my tips on saving cash with others; I just wanted a service to manage my money, nothing else. In that respect, Mint felt more refined and catered to my needs -- it was more focused.<p>Give your app laser-focus.",1285974670

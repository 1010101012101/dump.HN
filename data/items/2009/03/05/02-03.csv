They're disarmingly simple while still challenging your brain to shift into a recursive/applicative mindset.<p>As for what functional language you want to end up using...well, it depends on your goals.<p>I'm personally partial to the family of languages which use ML-style type systems, which include OCaml, F#, and Haskell.<p>The core of F# and OCaml are very similar. F# has better libraries whereas OCaml has both a more powerful type system and more powerful module system.<p>Haskell is less straight forward than OCaml and F# and has many more esoteric features you need to learn before being considered an expert. Nonetheless, many have found the process of learning to be a mind-expanding process. Also, the Haskell community is much larger and more vibrant than what you'll find with any other statically typed functional language.",1236221783

As far as I can tell, the goal of all of the teachers I know is to get the students to learn the material the best they can, so they structure the class around that ideal.  I fully understand that some students just want the credit, or to just get by with whatever they deem to be sufficient knowledge, but I don't think it would be generally beneficial to structure the class to give them incentives to do so.",1236221259

I'm not sure how this differentiates itself from other file hosting/photo sharing sites.  For instance can you have private photos on Flickr?  At the very least there are things like drop box as mentioned.  What about people who tend to share photos through Facebook?  Besides which, what is the monetisation strategy?  Freemium?  What features will be added?<p>There must be some sense or it wouldn't have got YC investment - maybe the idea is to execute this so well that Google buys you you as I don't think they have a good photo sharing method yet and it would be a great way to expand?",1236221144

A few examples...<p><i>no video games except pong</i> -- The Odyssey home system was sold as early as 1972.<p><i>Word processors were still 10 years away</i> -- WordStar for CP/M came out in 1978; for DOS in 1982. AppleWriter for Apples in 1979.<p><i>No one thought to make a sequel to a movie just because it made a lot of money</i> -- Ten Bond films had already been made by 1975.<p><i>The work week was five hours shorter</i> -- This still varies a lot by region and industry; there are plenty of people who work 9-5 or less. And long-term studies of work vs. leisure time suggest Americans were working slightly fewer hours in 2003 than 1975.

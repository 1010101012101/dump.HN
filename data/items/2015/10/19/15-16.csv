It&#x27;s how online chats should be.<p>I read that article, you&#x27;re right, at first glance, it&#x27;s pretty troubling.  Seeing the source (one of the oft-propagandistic, oft-badly-sourced Real Clear sites) made me want to follow up on the claims inside.<p>The Ohio man who was shot, it isn&#x27;t clear from any authoritative reporting what actually happened--the only people who explicitly link his attacker to a union are secondary sources.  It also looks like the authorities were in fact working on it, though I couldn&#x27;t find any sort of follow-up reporting.<p>The rest is all so vague that I can&#x27;t really make a lot of sense of it.<p>That said, of course I don&#x27;t condone violence, neither petty vandalism (like leaving debris in the Verizon driveways), nor the economic destruction left behind when multinationals bend laws in favor of offshoring, and then do so, and leave entire towns with no source of employ.<p>Neither of those is right, but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll get to the right place by trying to come up with one &quot;right&quot; set of laws that every person and every business must abide by--I think we&#x27;ll iterate closer and closer to &quot;right&quot; when people and groups work together to make their slice of the world better.<p>It&#x27;s just that, the entire time I&#x27;ve been alive, the working folks and the poor have been under the bootheel of a variety of--excuse the language, I can&#x27;t really think of another way to be succinct about it--oppressors both large and small, whether it&#x27;s the people who ship factories overseas to save some bucks (and bend laws in their favor), or the managers who willingly accept just-in-time staffing solutions that leave their workers with unpredictable work schedules, or the managers who cheat workers out of overtime by classifying them as &quot;salaried,&quot; or the managers who try to normalize 100-hour work weeks, or ... on and on and on.  We work a lot harder for a lot less, and we&#x27;re still on course to work even more, for even less.<p>If a union&#x27;s a way to bend that downward slope a bit, I&#x27;m all for it.  No historical evidence suggests that less regulation would do it.<p>Anyway, thanks again for keeping the discussion going in a courteous, engaging fashion.",1445270300

In current democracies, the very important issues are so important, that they become turned into political games. No significant changes are being made because there&#x27;s always a side that will fight tooth and nail to oppose it for purely political reasons. We can&#x27;t get anywhere, because no single person (or group) has enough power (or incentive) to just <i>make a call</i> and go through with it.<p>As for the last objection - the typical voter&#x27;s preference will be reflecting the political battles described above.<p>> <i>People change their preference based on other people all the time. As long as it is clearly their preference, we have to assume that it&#x27;s in their interest.</i><p>The problem is, it&#x27;s not people changing their mind because they&#x27;ve heard someone reasonable saying something that makes sense. Politicians lie. Lie blatantly and lie on purpose. They hire the entire advertising machine, built out of professional liers and bullshiters, to convince people that their side of the debate is right by whatever means necessary. The average voter has to oppose people who are <i>trained specialists in lying</i>. I don&#x27;t see how you could argue it&#x27;s actually their preference.<p>But back to the primary reason. I could accept that start of affairs as fair, as long as we&#x27;re dealing with things that don&#x27;t matter much. But at this moment in time, we have several important problems - like supergerms, climate change and depletion of fossil fuels - that are going to <i>destroy humanity</i> in few decades, or at least pull us back into the medieval age. <i>This shit matters</i>. We need to make some hard choices and do some decisive actions soon if we want to have <i>any</i> kind of civilization surviving to the end of this century. And the democratic process is by design incapable of making those hard choices.<p>TL;DR: I don&#x27;t want to &quot;give power to the smarter&quot; or a king or anything. I just want someone to actually do something about global warming and power issues before this stupid textbook-level coordination problem kills us all.",1445270231

As a side note, I saw a Concorde at the Air and Space museum recently. Its huge. About the length of a 787 and with less than half the seating capacity. From a cost perspective, there&#x27;s no way something like would ever be financially sound. How many people are in such a hurry and willing to pay such a premium?<p>Just because speed has reached a status quo of speed vs fuel, doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t innovate in other ways.  The interior and driving experience of a 2015 Honda Civic is far, far better than the 1979 Civic.  Yet they both do the same 65 mph on the expressway and both are cheap.<p>Blaming consumers is short-sighted and unfair here. The industry competes largely on fuel efficiency anyway.

Someone at the level of Jay Carney is ostensibly more than just a mouthpiece, but someone who gathers the information and weighs in on what&#x27;s useful and relevant to disseminate to the press. This isn&#x27;t always a nefarious thing; sometimes employees have incomplete information but aren&#x27;t in a position to confirm it with the executives.<p>At this phase, where the story has run and the damage has been done -- the response <i>should</i> be done by Carney. Take the rebuttal to Mr. Olson, for example. That revelation is absolutely not something that should be revealed by Mr. Olson&#x27;s boss or a coworker. First of all, just because you&#x27;re an engineer doesn&#x27;t mean you have all of the facts. The PR person is in a position to collect the facts, including whether or not it&#x27;s legal to reveal Mr. Olson&#x27;s reason for termination, and confirming that reason for termination with HR. Even Mr. Olson&#x27;s boss wouldn&#x27;t have that same level of confirmation.<p>The other advantage of having Carney make this response is that you can be sure that this is, for better or worse, the official company response. If instead, this was a blog post by Mr. Olson&#x27;s co-worker calling him out for being a fraud...and the reaction to it was negative...then Amazon could pedal back and say, &quot;Oh well that co-worker blogged something he shouldn&#x27;t have and now he is being punished&quot;.<p>But since the condemnation of Mr. Olson has come straight from Mr. Carney, any backlash will be rightly the reaping of what Bezos, Carney, and all their lawyers have sowed.<p>edit: FWIW, a non-anonymous redditor is saying that he knows Bo Olson, personally, and says &quot;I can assure you that Bo was not the one defrauding vendors that was another employee in the same department&quot;...it strikes me as improbable that Carney (again, not just Carney, but Amazon&#x27;s lawyers and HR) would get this wrong.

Normally I&#x27;d say using anything other than TLS is a huge warning sign, but as far as non-TLS protocols go, ZeroMQ&#x27;s &quot;CurveZMQ&quot; protocol actually ends up looking fairly good in my book.<p>Iris does none of this, advocating the use of global PSKs. Global PSKs are the bane of security professionals everywhere, as they make any system that shares the PSK the weakest link, greatly increasing the chance that the most overlooked system will become a vector for total system compromise. This is why we&#x27;ve generally seen a move away from such systems to running internal PKIs with unique keys per host.<p>Instead, they claim:<p>&quot;This is achieved through the observation that if a node of a service is compromised, the whole system is considered undermined.&quot;<p>This is pretty much the opposite trend of modern crypto practitioners.<p>It&#x27;s been awhile since I actually looked at their crypto, but at a cursory glance-over again it&#x27;s hand-rolled and uses bignums without random blinding, greatly increasing the chances of timing side-channels.<p>If you care about security, you probably shouldn&#x27;t be using this.",1445269039

Players lose an entire year of eligibility after a first positive test. A second offense means permanent ineligibility from sports.<p>But when you dig into the numbers, the NCAA’s roughly 11,000 annual tests amount to just a fraction of all athletes in Division I and II schools. Exactly how many tests are conducted each year on football players is unclear because the NCAA hasn’t published its data for two years, according to the AP, and when it did, it periodically changed the formats, making it impossible to compare one year of football to the next.<p>More confounding is that NCAA rules say players can be notified up to two days in advance of a test, which experts say is plenty of time to beat a test. By comparison, Olympic athletes are given no notice.<p>The top steroid investigator at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Joe Rannazzisi, told the AP that he doesn’t understand why schools don’t invest in the same kind of testing, with the same penalties, as the NFL.<p>“Is it expensive? Of course, but college football makes a lot of money,” he said. “Invest in the integrity of your program.”<p>For a school to test all 85 scholarship football players for steroids twice a season would cost up to $34,000, said Don Catlin, an anti-doping pioneer who spent years conducting the NCAA’s laboratory tests at UCLA. The total costs would be about 0.2 percent of the average big-time school football budget of about $14 million.<p>Caitlin told the AP he became so frustrated with the college system that it drove him in part to leave the testing industry to focus on anti-doping research.<p>The investigation also found that penalties vary widely from school to school. Here are a few examples:<p>•At Notre Dame and Alabama, the teams that will soon compete for the national championship, players don’t automatically miss games for testing positive for steroids. At Alabama, coaches have wide discretion. Notre Dame’s student-athlete handbook says a player who fails a test can return to the field once the steroids are out of his system.<p>•The University of North Carolina kicks players off the team after a single positive test for steroids.<p>•At UCLA, home of the laboratory that for years set the standard for cutting-edge steroid testing, athletes can fail three drug tests before being suspended.<p>•At the University of Maryland, students must get counseling after testing positive, but school officials are prohibited from disciplining first-time steroid users.",1445268938

I was offered a position by Google recently so I am above some threshold. It is really unfair to paint a broad class of people with such a sweeping brush. I find that people often overestimate efforts required to attain a skill level, probably due to human nature to elevate one&#x27;s own skills or importance, or they unconsciously conflate familiarity with general intelligence. It is impossible to reinvent collaborative filtering within 45 minutes without any prior exposure if not told any reason behind or constraints under which collaborative filtering was invented. Software engineers ask basic questions from the narrow fields they operate in day in and day out and believe that the interviewees have all requisite knowledge and answers should pop into their heads. On the contrary, basic questions are often fundamental innovations and it is no small feat to come up answers in the first place. It is a hallmark of a real intellectual to probe deeper and learn from that experience and realize insights and reasons for reaching innovative solutions, so that next time he or she will be innovative quicker or better.<p>It is hard to accurately judge someone in 45 minutes. I made a mistake with fizzbuzz three years ago when interviewing with the hacker school (now called recurse center), so what?

After reading that there is no shorter way than to enumerate all four possibilities I was able to mentally unlock. It took just a few months of studying example code and discerning coding patterns for different logic control flows and now multiple programmers have commented that I write readable code. Anyone who has worked through real analysis problems can reason through most code well. It is a matter of concentration and time. I firmly believe programmers can make good ML engineers even though I spent years on numerical linear algebra, mathematical programming (optimization), statistics with measure theory and I still feel I have huge gaps in knowledge. So what if someone doesn&#x27;t know a basic theorem, as long as they can learn enough and apply it to do their job. We take people as they are and help them grow into roles we want.

Lemieux mentored Crosby. Sergei Federov mentored and played alongside a rising Alex Ovechkin. The older guys were well established. They&#x27;d been young, excelled, failed, and seen it all.

Making your new founders understand that they&#x27;re not to be feared, but consulted as a source of wisdom could steer them around potential mistakes, and provide that steadfastness when the cluster craps itself at 2AM.<p>Of course you want everyone to believe in your vision, even if there&#x27;s some skepticism, you need people behind you to succeed. It&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to evaluate on that.<p>But if I were in charge of an incubator, I&#x27;d be instructing that founder that, when she or he is building that young crack team, grab a few veterans as well.

It&#x27;s pretty easy to bypass a simple scan with objc_msgSend.<p>Conversely, it would be nice if the user could grant access to email and iMessage sandboxes. This would allow us to apply machine learning to personalize services. Ironically, by allowing opt-in, Android is an easier platform for creating private services.",1445266864

When confronted with the evidence, he admitted it and resigned immediately.<p>Together with the inappropriate disclosure of performance reviews, this statement just makes me think that Amazon probably has a culture of defrauding vendors, and usually gets away with it, but sometimes has to blame a junior hire to save face when caught.",1445266819

That&#x27;s not damning, but it does require you to trust the reporters to distill a large complicated mess to representative pieces.<p>What part of Carney&#x27;s piece do you think similarly depends on us trusting him?  Do you think he fabricated the email from Kantor?  Do you think he&#x27;s outright lying about the context of  Olson&#x27;s dismissal to the extent that it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> incumbent on the Times to disclose this in the original article?<p>I&#x27;m totally willing to accept for the sake of argument that Carney is dishonest, but I think that is largely beside the point here.  If you accept the truth of the bare facts presented by Carney, putting aside his spin, then the badness of Carney and/or Amazon is <i>irrelevant</i> for assessing the badness of the NYTimes.",1445266815

Let us take it as a given that there really is a stereotype threat and/or that women are systematically discriminated against with regard to acquiring math skills. Let us take it as a given that damage is really being done. The natural conclusion is that regardless of what name is put on the top of the test, the women should <i>still</i> do worse, because they really are worse at math at the time the test is being given, which is to say, after 15-20 years of systematic discrimination. If the discrimination is effective, then by definition it must mean they really <i>are</i> worse. If they aren&#x27;t worse, then the discrimination is either ineffective, or women are naturally <i>better</i> at math and the discrimination is holding them back (a position which would be quite complicated to establish and defend).<p>If the damage can be undone by merely putting a different name on the top of the test, then that strongly implies that the putative damage is itself illusory. If the damage can be wiped away so easily, then it can&#x27;t have been that bad in the first place. If this <i>is</i> the extent of the &quot;stereotype threat&quot;, then it&#x27;s obviously not holding them back all that much if <i>even so</i> their real skill is equal to the men&#x27;s.<p>I can&#x27;t help but think that this study was indeed ideologically driven, and in the zeal the authors had to prove their point about how women aren&#x27;t worse than men, they didn&#x27;t think about the fact this accidentally &quot;proves&quot; that the discrimination can&#x27;t be that significant. But perhaps it is just a neutral study performed out of sheer curiosity.<p>And just to make it perfectly clear, I am taking their own logic on their own merits.

They&#x27;re left over from a time before the standards were defined by the W3C.  At this point, and it is about time, they should rightly be removed, and the standard/common way should prevail.  That doesn&#x27;t mean a given feature was rooted in a mistake.<p>I think the biggest issue is you should only target a given browser when you <i>have</i> to.  Once in a while you come across a bug that only presents itself in a specific browser and version.  A good thing about frequent/forced updates is you have to support older browsers less and less.  Unfortunately XP was locked out at IE8, and Vista at IE9...  Vista won&#x27;t go away for at least 4-5 more years.  I think the biggest danger in the older versions of IE tied to windows is that those people don&#x27;t upgrade.  It&#x27;s just in the past 2 years that IE6 & IE7 can safely be ignored.<p>I remember the IE4-6 days... back then, IE was better... Where they deserve the vitriol is when it comes to letting their browsers stagnate for close to 6 years.  And finally, with IE10/11 are they even catching up.  It really bugs me that they put so much attention into accelerated canvas support before they finished a lot of CSS features that are more likely to be used.  Gradients for example, the old ie gradients + rounded corners is broken even IE9, not sure about IE10-11 as I&#x27;ve taken to using SVG gradients as they are more consistent everywhere.<p>It also sucks that running multiple versions of IE is pretty much impossible.  ex: the scripting engine is always the newer version, so even using multiple IE&#x27;s a live bug on the real version may not present itself.<p>I know how/why we are here, that said I still don&#x27;t think that we should call decisions past that weren&#x27;t thought of by anyone as mistakes at the time as such now.

However, IME this simply isn&#x27;t true:<p><i>People put a huge amount of time into working around, and complaining about, cross browser issues. Devoting a small fraction of that time to submitting regression tests instead would dramatically decrease the number of problems in the future.</i><p>The effort required for a regular user to file a bug report in the major browsers is <i>insane</i>. The bug trackers involved are among the most user-hostile and over-complicated interfaces I have ever encountered.<p>Developers move to six-weekly releases with at least three different flavours in the works at any given time, and then expect people running the regular browser to install a completely different version of the software to test things before filing bug reports. This is <i>insane</i>.<p>In Firefox&#x27;s case in particular, users are often asked to create a new profile, which AFAIK still requires command-line hackery and, from direct personal experience, carries a significant risk of corrupting or destroying your regular profile even if you follow the instructions to the letter. This is <i>insane</i>.<p>And even if users do make the Herculean effort required to create a minimal test case, install the latest development versions of the browser, create a clean profile if necessary, confirm that the bug still happens, and fight through the bug tracker to file a report, there is still no guarantee that anything will actually be done about it. Quality of implementation is obviously not the priority for several of the major browser developers, certainly not Mozilla and Google, and major bugs and site-breaking regressions are frequently ignored for very long periods while shiny new features no-one is actually going to use in production for years and another 0.3642% performance boost in JavaScript are prioritised.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m a professional software developer, and as such I appreciate the value of good bug reports and feedback from users, and I hate it when users make blanket criticisms. But Mozilla and Google are among the most user-hostile organisations on the software landscape in this respect, and until they fundamentally change their approach, I don&#x27;t see this situation improving. Meanwhile, their users, and those of us trying to develop web sites and applications to support those users against a constantly moving and frequently breaking target, are the ones who lose out.<p>For the record, I debated whether to post this. Ranting on public forums is rarely constructive. But in this case, I think the presumption that it takes much less time to file good bug reports than to find workarounds must be challenged, or the situation isn&#x27;t going to improve. For someone who isn&#x27;t a regular contributor, following the guidelines to file a bug report in the way that Mozilla and co would like isn&#x27;t the five minute job it should be, it&#x27;s closer to a five hour job, and I think sometimes the developers/regular contributors/bleeding edge alpha testers don&#x27;t even realise that.",1372783578

3) Make the post-signup page URL look something like this:

Misogyny can be manifested in the denigration or sexual objectification of women and in entrenched prejudice against women.  From Wikipedia (first item in the definition) &quot;Misogyny .... is a central part of sexist prejudice and ideology and, as such, is an important basis for the oppression of females in male-dominated societies. Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography...&quot; (Allan G. Johnson).<p>The attitude expressed in the linked article is that pornography is an appropriate (and amusing) subject to link to something to be used in academic and professional contexts.  Further, that it&#x27;s amusing that pornography is linked to a prominent woman simply by virtue of her surname.  In doing so, those who named the programming language and those who find it amusing are denigrating both Linda Boreman and Ada Lovelace and expressing and normalising the attitude that this is amusing and appropriate.  I find this a clear case of misogyny.<p>> I really don&#x27;t think overreactions like these help anyone.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an overreaction, and I would think that the appropriate reaction is to condemn these instances of misogyny.  In doing so, hopefully we can create an environment and industry less hostile to women and girls.  I&#x27;d say that would help quite a few people.",1372783006

Verify that the bug occurs in the latest available (possibly unstable/nightly) build.<p>2. Submit the bug to the relevant browser/engine bug tracking system (see below). If you aren&#x27;t confident about how to write a good bug report, read [1] first.<p>3. Write a testcase. If at all possible this should be minimal (i.e. not using the whole of jQuery/Angular/whatever) and should certainly be clear (e.g. no minimised code unless it is actually needed to reproduce the issue).<p>4. If the bug is a conformance bug rather than a QoI issue, submit your testcase to the W3C [2] so that it can be incorporated into the standard testsuite and automatically run by all browser vendors. To do this the test needs to be written in a standard format [3] and submitted using the process at [4]. At the moment the documentation is a bit sucky, but there is a big revamp in the works [5], so that should improve in the near future.<p>That last one may sound like a lot of effort, but testing is the <i>only</i> way that we will end up with a web platform that is both technologically competitive and open both in spirit and in practice i.e. with multiple interoperable implementations. People put a huge amount of time into working around, and complaining about, cross browser issues. Devoting a small fraction of that time to submitting regression tests instead would dramatically decrease the number of problems in the future. For example submitting a test for canvas clipping both makes it likely that IE will be fixed in the near future, and also ensures that it won&#x27;t then just regress again one version later.<p>It seems that it would be in the self-interest of big projects like jQuery to commit to creating a test for each time they have to work around some browser bug, so they can expediate fixing the issue, track which browser versions have the bug, and remove the workaround  and thus reduce their code complexity  as soon as the test passes in all the browsers they are targeting. However this is not just something that matters to big projects. If you have run across a bug that is making it difficult to implement something, you are likely the best person in the world to write a testcase for that issue.<p>If you are trying to submit bug reports and tests and need help, please ask on #whatwg on Freenode irc or #testing on irc.w3.org [6].<p>Bug trackers:<p><pre><code>  Gecko: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/

Also, although he was trying to say something interesting about the mass-production of art you can see that even his prints were hand-produced and often have manual brushwork on them.<p>3.

He hand-drew illustration for magazine, adverts & products so was being paid and appreciated for his skill in the tough world of graphic design before he became a renowned artist.<p>4.

5978834,comment,5977047,5978714,10,0,rayiner,,,"People are paid just less than MIN(cost to replace their labor in the labor market, cost to replace their labor with automation). Using terms like &quot;worth&quot; or &quot;deserve&quot; invoke a moral framework and it is unnecessary to do so. There is one moral framework where people are &quot;worth&quot; the price of their labor at the equilibrium of supply and demand, but that&#x27;s not the only conceivable arrangement. For example, partners in a joint venture are rarely compensated on the equilibrium of supply and demand, but based on some percentage of the value of the venture. If someone&#x27;s labor creates $X of value, there is no reason to say it is &quot;worth&quot; whatever it would cost to hire someone else to do the same labor instead of saying it is &quot;worth&quot; say 0.2 * $X.<p>Which brings me to the issue of $50k median household income. Contrary to your assertion, it is highly indicative of workers with weakening negotiating power. The story of the last 30 years has been one of inflation-adjusted individual income (using household income is misleading because it glosses over changing labor force participation trends) lagging individual worker productivity. That means of each dollar value created by each worker, the employer (usually the capital owner) gets to keep more of that dollar today than they did 30 years ago. That is exactly what you would expect based on a decrease in workers negotiating power.<p>This isn&#x27;t a political argument, it&#x27;s an economic argument. I&#x27;m not endorsing any particular steps towards remedying this issues. I&#x27;m pointing out the economic phenomena we are seeing.",1372781832

The primary error in this analysis is that it confuses a shift in the structure of relative prices with a general rise in the level of prices. If the labor costs of businesses are increased and they succeed in passing on the costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, they will have managed to change the structure of relative prices at the expense of businesses that are unable to raise their prices because of more-intense competition. This is quite distinct from a general increase in the level of prices, which would be possible only if the real supply of money was increased.<p>Many firms, however, may be unable to pass on their increased costs to consumers. It is consumers who ultimately determine the price of any good on the market, and they may decide that a business&#x27;s product is not worth a higher price. Producers cannot force consumers to buy what they produce, and businesses cannot always arbitrarily increase the prices of their products simply because the government has arbitrarily increased their costs.</i><p>Oh.<p>Well, how about free market champion Milton Friedman? What did he think? <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/1970-stagflation.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/1970-stagf...</a><p><i>Milton Friedman did not believe in cost push inflation. He believed that &quot;inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&quot; In other words, he believed prices could not increase without an increase in the money supply.</i><p>Oh.",1372780942

Where amazon shines is the amount of programmatic interaction you can do with it - have build scripts kick off an EC2 instance to run tests, send reports, shut it down.  Programmatically bring up more instances during peak times, spin them down at night, etc.<p>AFAICT, Linode doesn&#x27;t offer that, and they probably won&#x27;t.  Amazon&#x27;s been ahead in this arena for awhile, and will probably keep that lead for the forseeable future.  EDIT: Apparently they do have an API which would cover a decent variety of use cases.<p>What&#x27;s sad is the number of people that migrate over to Amazon because it&#x27;s the done thing, without realizing what they&#x27;re paying for (and that they&#x27;re not utilizing the unique features of EC2).",1372780929

5978712,comment,5977819,5977819,2,0,awj,,,"We&#x27;ve been doing this for ages where I work. New EC2 AMIs are built inside a disk image. We can pretty easily use all of the standard tools through chroot, so installing packages is relatively simple and flexible.<p>Instances are ready for use immediately after booting, and deploying new code is as simple as rebuilding the image and booting it. We can also easily scale up most forms of servers by simply booting more and adding them to the proxy as they come up.<p>The only downside here is that firefighting still kind of remains a two step process. Even after investing a decent bit of time optimizing the process, it still takes 5-10 minutes to build and upload an image. From there it takes another 5-30 minutes to get EC2 to boot it, so there&#x27;s a strong temptation to tweak things on the server. I&#x27;ve taken to patching, testing, and committing the fix on the tag for that release so I can simply apply a diff to get the server up to date. Not perfect, but it goes a long way to prevent regressions.",1372780872

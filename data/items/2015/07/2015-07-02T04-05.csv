I think the most relevant field of US law with that sort of provision is <i>trademark</i> law, which shouldn&#x27;t have been at issue here at all (3taps and Padmapper were not pretending to be Craigslist or authorized by Craigslist). <i>Copyright</i> law, which is sorta relevant, does not have such a provision. If your song gets pirated, you can sue only the pirates named Fred without losing your right to sue. The CFAA, which is definitely relevant here, does not have such a provision: JSTOR does not have their hands full with CFAA cases against everyone who ever sent an article to a colleague or friend.<p>2. What prevented Craigslist from giving a straightforward license and API to Padmapper? That would have sidestepped any such concern, without setting a precedent that everyone else must get API access. I think it&#x27;s pretty clear from this case that they did not want to see Padmapper exist, and regardless of whether they were obligated to sue and try to shut them down, they clearly <i>wanted</i> to sue and shut this particular application down.",1435813195

NYC and Boston stood up to their interstate plan. SF&#x27;s Embarcadero fell down in an earthquake and they wisely didn&#x27;t rebuild it, which then created a desirable waterfront.<p>>Detroit is basically fallen over, of course, but blaming the highway system for that is fairly disingenuous.<p>Urban planners (the people most knowledgeable on this subject) would not call this &quot;disingenuous&quot;. The cities that are most prosperous and desirable in this country are dense without highways cutting through them. People want walkable environments with 24/7 activity, not just buildings peppered throughout parking lots.<p>In Detroit&#x27;s case they cut through downtown with highways to easily connect them to the suburbs. This also meant adding parking lots. When new buildings were built, the code required a certain amount of parking. This ease of mobility allowed &quot;white flight&quot; to the suburbs. This reduced the amount of people living downtown along with amenities, reducing rent which reduces taxes. Detroit also never annexed its suburbs, so the tax base was reduced even more.<p>It&#x27;s basically a textbook case of what not to do. Live by the car, die by the car.<p>Here are some more cities:<p><a href=""http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/</a>",1435811719

The out of state seller is not, and my state has no authority to require them to do the collection for it.<p>I <i>think</i> that when OP referred to extortion, he was referring to Chicago collecting through Netflix, instead of requiring its residents to remit the tax themselves.<p>If Netflix does not have a sufficient nexus with Chicago to force them to collect, I too would like to see them tell Chicago to go suck donkey lincolns. My reason is not because of any philosophical objection to their tax, but simply because of the effects if other municipalities also decide to do this.<p>Collecting tax for thousands of municipalities would be a nightmare. There would be a plethora of ways they would provide rate data. Some would have a reasonable way to get it, like a URL that retrieves the current rate and valid date range, and the upcoming rate when it is going to change. Some would have arcane online protocols. Some would have a .DOC file you can download. Some would have it in a memo that you can get a PDF copy of. UUUUUUGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!<p>Then there would be actually paying the tax. That would be like getting rates--many different methods of reporting, with many different requirements for what you have to report.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with sales tax, and with VAT in the EU. Every Thor damned taxing authority seems to assume that they are the only taxing authority you are collecting taxes for, so if they make part or all of the process hard to automate it is no big deal. Let every municipality in on this, and small companies will need a full time person just dealing with tax rate tracking and tax reporting.<p>[1] well actually it&#x27;s my state&#x27;s use tax, not my state sales tax, in this case, but for all practical purposes they are the same.",1435810015

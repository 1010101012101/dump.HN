5826420,comment,5820245,5823866,1,0,aphyr,,,"<i>So any system that can handle a split brain by crash failing successfully handles the situation?</i><p>We seem to disagree about what ""availability"" means in the context of CAP. Nothing has to crash. All that a serializable system has to do under partition is refuse to respond to at least one possible request. Exactly which requests is algorithm-dependent.<p>For example, a system with e3PC quorum reads and writes will handle partitions by refusing to allow reads or writes in any minority component. If it writes to all nodes and can read from any node, it will refuse to accept any writes during partition, but all nodes can service read requests consistently. Conversely, if it writes to any node and reads from all, it can <i>always</i> handle write requests, but reads will fail.<p>Pragmatically, the desire for single-node-failure tolerance leads most CP systems to accept operations only when a majority of nodes are accessible. Systems like Paxos, Viewstamped Replication, ZAB, and Raft provide CP semantics in exactly this way: a partition which divides a 5-node cluster into a 3-node component and a 2-node component will continue to work correctly in the 3-node component, and the 2-node component will refuse requests until the partition is resolved.<p>Not all systems will shut down a component completely. Most sharded CP databases will run, say, Paxos quorums between groups of three or five replicas, but overlap those replicas around the hash ring. This is the design described by Eric Brewer for Stasis, and is the planned design for Cassandra's CaS and Riak's CP write support. These systems offer serializability over any particular key (or shard, e.g. a single  quorum), but not <i>between</i> keys. During failure, some keys will be consistently accessible in one component, and a disjoint set of keys will be accessible in another.<p><i>The definitions here are so broad, and doesnt really match my experience, which is namely detecting a fully split brain is difficult for humans to do, harder for systems, and generally causes major problems.</i><p>You are correct--designing CP algorithms is difficult. Luckily, you don't have to, because we have several already.

Slouching, for example, feels relaxing but it's pretty taxing on your lower back... you just don't notice that until later on.  Correcting these habits is a pain in the ass... even people who allocate many, many hours can take a long time (years) before they change their natural stance or form.  Quick fixes like shoe inserts can even be counter productive as humans are pretty good at adjusting their previous habit to the new circumstance.<p>Because of this, I'm a bit skeptical that changing or removing your footwear 'forces' you to do something right.  If you have bad form while running with supportive shoes, I'm pretty confident you'll be able to maintain that bad form while running shoeless.",1370447837

5826406,comment,5826117,5826117,5,0,jtbigwoo,,,"There are more companies like Amazon, but they don't exist online.  Amazon is Walmart, Costco, CVS, and Target.  (You could also compare them to Home Depot, Meijer, Kroger, etc.)<p>There are two traditional paths to success in business--high volume/low margin or low volume/high margin (Timex vs. Rolex).  Walmart is the classic high volume/low margin company.  They started as a five-and-dime.  Over the years they used their growing market power to add more product lines until they became a one-stop shop for everything.  Amazon has followed Walmart's playbook almost from the beginning.  While other early competitors were passionate about books, Amazon was passionate about warehouses and operations.  The same thing happened when Amazon moved into music, electronics, and everything else.  They could operate faster and cheaper than the other guys.<p>There are two reasons why there isn't another Amazon in the online world.  First, geography meant that Walmart, Target, and Costco didn't directly compete in every place from the very start.  They had time to develop and fortify an operational base and then expand.  Companies like buy.com had to immediately challenge amazon in order to survive.  Second, technology companies don't generally focus on the low margin/high volume path.  Online companies are generally populated by folks from the tech industry who look to Microsoft and Apple as their models for operating a company.",1370447722

Gems aren't presented as win buttons but rather as boosts to a particular aspect. When you add boosts together you're basically buying things outright but there's no button for ""$65 max level barracks"" (haven't played, won't be). This is important because it's more like ""I have all these pieces except..."" and you have this resource you started with and have received more of via normal gameplay that happens to solve the problem. I'm sure the amounts start low and slowly increase.<p>As for the hollow/bored, it's a competitive multiplayer game. Being the biggest dog in the neighborhood is always fun and once that's over it becomes you against the guy in the next neighborhood over who's also spending so it becomes not about spending money to win but rather spending money to compete.<p>This is a classic pay to win set of mechanics. It works when your audience either doesn't know how things work like the author or doesn't care (enthusiasts of the korean mmos that pioneered the model).

By lowering restrictions for LSA’s, it was predicted that planes would be able to sell for around $60,000.<p>9 years later, none of the big players in the industry have been able to accomplish this.  Cessna made its Skycatcher, which was supposed to sell for under $100,000.  It launched in 2007 at $110,000, and has since increased its price up to $150,000.  Several, better attempts at an affordable LSA have been made since then, but decent planes have struggled to find price points under $80,000.  A few are sold in the $60-80k range, but these are “bare-bones” airplanes, and the market has shown little demand for planes not equipped with radios, lights, navigation, iPod jacks, etc… even if they are affordable.<p>I co-founded a company that has made an airplane with all these amenities and more for $55k.  The design has been around for a few years now and comes from a kit-plane manufacturer in the Czech Republic.  It is tiny:  250 pounds empty weight, which is small enough to be classified as an ultralight (although its performance takes it way out of ultralight eligibility).  It is very strong, capable of carrying 60 pounds of fuel, a 230 pound pilot, and 30 pounds of baggage.  Because it’s so small, the performance specs are competitive with the Cessna Skycatcher on just a 50 hp engine.  It is very fuel efficient, getting 60 mpg and flying 575 miles on one tank.  Radio, GPS navigation, collision avoidance, synthetic flight, lights, and an emergency locator transmitter all come standard on the plane.<p>I know this isn’t tech news, but I love this website and rarely get to contribute since I’m not a programmer.

5826052,comment,5824405,5824779,7,0,Dn_Ab,,,"There is a lot of sense in this. From youth we've been trained that nuclear radiation is associated with cancer, Godzilla and mutant fish. My own irrational hate of Nuclear Fission plants comes from the hard learned lessons of Civilization 3; which teaches one to avoid building Nuclear plants due to the incredible rate of meltdowns and the subsequent massive death count and many turn loss of productive tiles. And global warming. Given all that, the level of trepidation around them should not come as a surprise. And if that isn't bad enough, fission plants are like airplanes. Crashes I mean.<p>People are afraid of Airplanes despite their incredible safety record because failure is spectacular and newsworthy. Consequence is concentrated and easily compartmentalized vs the more background event of the <i>relatively</i> near constant death from cars/coal (I wonder if this is leakage due to the brain reusing the smell cancellation modules on abstract frequencies like death rate). Similarly, the impact of meltdowns can be more viscerally felt in terms of relocation and ghost towning - even if they lead to little to no measured cancers or ill health (the worst case of incompetency in the form of Chernobyl is a fraction of the time integral health/death/radiative burden of coal plants to locals and workers). And to top it off, damage can be easily visualized in terms of three eyed fish, Godzilla and those ugly, ugly orange tiles. <i>Shiver</i>. Availability Heuristic at work.<p>At the same time I believe there is some cause for apprehension. It has to do with what the state current US infrastructure suggests on the real risks of a plant; failure of which might trigger an AI Winter type event at the worst possible time. The risk of Fission Plants is mainly in human competency and complacency. Will there be any corners cut in design and will operators become complacent due to extended runs of non-events? Will vital maintenance be done? I have not seen evidence that much of the world is ready for that kind of thing. The west is yes, mostly, but as the rest of the world comes online it would be preferable to have clean energy that doesn't jump to 50% chance of meltdown during revolts. So looking at alternative replacements at the same time as - instead of just focusing on -Nuclear is worthwhile.<p>A single large failure and human reaction to that kind of thing will lead to cascading moving away from Nuclear at just the time when it is most needed. It is thus in my opinion, better to do limited roll outs on newer incompetency resistant designs before any universal switching. Education on the nature of different types of radiation and their effects (focus on neutron vs bio, halflives vs waste), drastically reduced dangers to workers of nuclear vs coal plants, unloading the weighting on the bomb aspect of nuclear, probability theory, and shining a clarifying light on the stellar safety record of nuclear plants; will all go a long way towards solving the world's future energy problems.<p>As for me, while (I think) Civ 5 doesn't have that stupid penalty, the damage is already done. I will always recommend Solar and Hydro in place of Nuclear.",1370444665

Or you can draw parallels with extension classes in C# or Scala.<p>This is a sort of pretty common stuff, imho. Not some crown jewel Python has snatched from a unique language that was the only one to implement it.<p>I use Python since ~1999, and had a chance to observe how the language has imported a number of approaches from other languages, usually to a great benefit of its users. This is one more step. Note how it does not introduce a single bit of new syntax or backward incompatibility, btw.",1370444406

6619596,comment,6617154,6618538,1,0,stephencanon,,,"None of us objected to you saying that people refer to Cupertino as being in the South Bay.  What we objected to was the second half of that sentence: &quot;... rather than the Bay Area.&quot;  As written, this implies that the people in question believe that the South Bay is not part of the Bay Area, which is delusional.  Maybe you didn&#x27;t intend to say that, but that&#x27;s what you wrote, and what everyone responded to.<p>Regarding &quot;great&quot; vs. &quot;competent&quot; engineers: every company needs a mix of them.  There aren&#x27;t enough truly great engineers for even just Apple or Google to be entirely staffed by them, much less all of the other companies out there.  So everyone needs to make do with merely competent engineers in some roles.<p>You mentioned in a sibling comment that the engineers in question &quot;contract at Apple&quot;; here you wonder if Apple is merely &quot;hiring competent engineers to implement a roadmap&quot;.  But that&#x27;s exactly what all companies hire contractors for, whereas great engineers who are &quot;let loose to think different&quot; are typically permanent employees.",1382824751

I don&#x27;t want to give a website my email until I have a clear sense of what their value proposition is.  In other words, the more I can do without signing up, the more likely I am to see the value and eventually become a registered user, paying customer, and recommend the service to others.<p>With Github, for example, I lurked for months before joining.  Usually browsing and cloning public projets.<p>Letting your users see real projects that people are working on (even ones that have voluntarily become public) is a plus.<p>Also, I think that, since you&#x27;re targeting a market that&#x27;s not already familiar with Git, your marketing should focus specifically on the value that Git-enabled workflows can provide.

I do acknowledge that the formula is flawed and Congress could do a better job (especially in extending protections to areas not designated historically discriminatory that might be now). However, my specific point on bringing that up is that Scalia can&#x27;t be counted on to hold to his own originalist views, so I emphasized his deferral to other branches of government instead as the sticking point, as well as his general dismissal of the right to privacy. Any combination of these factors make him pretty hopeless on this case, regardless.<p>I made a mistake blindly sticking Alito in there, without considering his views on privacy. However, he does have a very strong deference to executive power that would place him in that bucket of deferring to national security agencies (and indeed probably drove his majority opinion on Clapper v. Amnesty).<p>&quot;One troubling memo concerns domestic wiretaps - a timely topic. In the memo, which he wrote as a lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department, Judge Alito argued that the attorney general should be immune from lawsuits when he illegally wiretaps Americans.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/24/opinion/24sat1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/24/opinion/24sat1.html</a><p>While I have this comment thread going, I&#x27;ll clarify what I meant by wildcard. I never intended to note this being a special instance for the court, but rather I wanted to emphasize how this particular forum (a hub for technology leaders) can get involved in a deep policy issue like this, and have their views be well-respected. That doesn&#x27;t happen that often. It was my call to action to this forum, rather than any particular critique of the court.",1382824438

I go look at my bike - it&#x27;s still upright, the front tire got wedged in a rust spot. I grab it out, hop on, and ride. I couldn&#x27;t help but laugh the rest of the way to class.<p>That&#x27;s the day I decided that bikers and automobiles need better communication. So I made a bike light that&#x27;s easy to use, has front & back blinkers, brake lights, turns on when you ride (so you can&#x27;t forget), a bright front light, USB rechargeable, 3400 mAh LiIon battery. I made a 3D printer to print the parts, I did the PCB design, physical design, and software. It&#x27;s pretty damn cool. I ride pretty regularly and recharge it about once every three weeks. It&#x27;s surprisingly water resistance - I am a little scared of selling this to people as I didn&#x27;t know how it would handle water, but I&#x27;ve taken it through two large storms, one with huge puddles splashing all over the cases, and the light handled it all in stride.<p>Here&#x27;s the images - <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/EUzXm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/EUzXm</a><p>I&#x27;m stalling on it a little bit right now - there&#x27;s not a very good way of bootstrapping into manufacturing. I could 3D print the cases and assemble the boards, but each case takes about 20 hours to print (on my fiddly printer). There&#x27;s ~100 components too, which is a pain for manual placing and reflowing. I have a couple other designs brewing that are simpler and lower cost, but without all the fancy features. Speaking of which... I have to go get some interrupts working.",1382823892
6619532,comment,6618491,6619328,2,0,EGreg,,,"Fiat currencies are inherently inflationary. That&#x27;s because people are forced to accept that currency, and on the basis of the M0 money there is a lot of other money, such as the credit money that far exceeds the amount of M0 money. We regulate how much banks must keep on reserve but ultimately the money supply is inflated not just by governments but by the banks. If every bank issued its own currency, then theoretically its credit would be affected by overextending how much money it lent out. And indeed in the free banking era, many banks failed. (I should point out, though, that even in the so-called free-banking era, the fractional reserve requirements were regulated by the states.) By having a lender of last resort (the Fed), we essentially have replaced a large amount of interbank credit with regulation and a moral hazard. Before computers, it was hard to keep track of so many currencies, but now we might want to revisit that idea.<p>Anyway, all fiat currencies are inflationary. This in itself isn&#x27;t bad as log as the inflation matches our GDP or at least matches the inflation of every other currency. The Chinese for example peg their currency to the US dollar so they can continue selling us more stuff. I don&#x27;t know how long this policy will continue.<p>What I am worried about is the trade deficit and the effect of automation and outsourcing on the working class and the general economy. I for example employ developers overseas. Amazon has disrupted bookstores. iTunes has disrupted record stores. The Mac and iPhone, once proudly built in the USA, are now assembled overseas from materials obtained overseas. This is a good thing for the consumer and for flexibility -- supply chains are now all over the world. It is BAD for the environment -- tons of stuff shipped all over the world and wasting fuel merely because capitalism moves things and people around geographically ... producers wanting to produce as much as they can to turn a bigger profit ... this is unsustainable. And it&#x27;s BAD for the working class, who are in a race to the bottom with people whose cost of living is much smaller, and who -- thanks to recent technological advances -- can take the jobs of local businesses who until now have enjoyed a comparative advantage.<p>When you can&#x27;t issue your own fiat currency, you fare worse. Witness the PIGS countries in Europe after they lost the ability to issue their own currency. They&#x27;re all in the south and their economies are slower-paced. I would wager that their trade deficits were quickly affected as the local businesses lost their comparative advantage, but their own governments couldn&#x27;t help them by printing money, only by borrowing. So they became at the mercy of German and English banks. A similar situation faces many cities in the USA.",1382823891

Studies have shown that people who know they are under surveillance change their behavior. They don&#x27;t challenge the status quo or participate in creative destruction because they fear being punished for it.<p>In general, mass surveillance is a tool for the few to control the many. It allows government officials to destroy popular movements by detecting and disrupting them early in their evolution before they gain enough political power to stand on their own. Governments engaging in this sort of political espionage is a historical fact.<p>Take the analogy of the federal government issuing every member of the NYPD a Humvee and a machine gun, in case they have to fight Taliban insurgents on the streets of New York. Doing so is hugely objectionable, not because we like the Taliban, but because the number of Taliban in New York is small and the number of innocent civilians is large, so the innocent civilians become by far the largest category of individuals who end up eating one of those bullets.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with mass surveillance. Government surveillance is a tool of destruction. The reason the NSA is engaged in this surveillance isn&#x27;t so that they can send you a reminder when you forget to pick up your kid from soccer practice, it&#x27;s so that they know where to send soldiers to destroy the enemy.

This is costly, and not as healthy as it can be.  To remedy that, I&#x27;d like to start a thread for your favorite quick to prepare, cheap, healthy recipes, which I like to refer to as &quot;Bachelor Chow&quot; (you know, like the stuff that Fry eats on Futurama).  There are no hard qualifications, but basically anything that can either be prepared in about 5 minutes (even if it has to cook for a half hour or so), and/or something that you can make a large quantity of and it keeps good for leftovers.<p>For example:  Chicken and yellow rice -- get a bag of frozen chicken breasts (about $7, usually has 4 - 6 pieces of various sizes), a bag of mixed frozen vegetables, and a package of yellow rice (essentially, rice with turmeric and other seasonings).  Boil 1 - 2 pieces of chicken (takes about 15 minutes to boil), cut or tear into small pieces, throw chicken pieces, frozen peas, yellow rice, and appropriate amount of water in a pan (the rice package gives how much water to add), cover and cook for about half an hour.  Total time in front of stove, 5 minutes (broken down into two separate sessions), total cooking time about 45 minutes.\nVariations include using strips of boneless pork chops (brown pork first in skillet, doesn&#x27;t have to be cooked all the way through), and you can slice up red potatoes on top instead of peas.<p>Both of these are awesome even a few days later (or fill small bags with the leftovers and throw them in the freezer.<p>Another quick recipe is beef stew -- basically a package of stew meat ($6.00 or so), a large bag of soup-mix vegetables (this should include potatoes, or you can cut up red potatoes -- reds, so you don&#x27;t have to peel the skins), a package of stew seasoning.  About $9, makes enough for about 6 meals.<p>So, any others?  If this thread gets some up-votes, I&#x27;ll add a few more in the comments section.",1382822835

A global passive adversary would be able to pinpoint the origin of posts if they had access to the wire-level data if posts were sent in cleartext, but all the connections are encrypted with TLS, so that&#x27;s impossible. With no physical access, Aether should be pretty much unbreakable (I hope I won&#x27;t have to eat this later) barring external vectors (keyloggers, rootkits etc).<p>If they have access to your computer, there are two possibilities, depending on your settings. If you have left locally flagging own posts as such enabled (the default setting), it will identify the posts you have created. But if you explicitly disabled that option, even that does not incriminate you: your node is just another node that might have been touched by that post.<p>The reason I have that &#x27;own post&#x27; flag is that it is the only way I can show or notify the user about the replies he / she receives. This is kind of an important ability, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have even given the option to flag. It&#x27;s a tradeoff between user experience and security: I am trying to protect proper citizens from eavesdropping, but I&#x27;m not interested in protecting criminals in case of computer seizure. The only reason I have protections against that kind of threat also is the possibility of people in less fortunate countries (where bar for seizure is low) getting their computers seized because of their exercise of free speech.<p>For the transport: so long as you have an IP address that the remote node can contact you back, it will work. It does not matter if it&#x27;s Tor, I2P or whatever. Granted, I did not try actually doing this yet, but there is no reason it should not work.",1382822789

I also, as you pointedly refused to acknowledge, expressed dissatisfaction with that state of affairs.<p>* Various commenters cited evidence of a lack of respect for the laws of Congress which were, to my eyes, all further evidence of the former point (opaqueness and &quot;flexibility&quot; in an area of law that was designed to be opaque and open-ended) and not the latter. I then refined my comment to be about criminal law, <i>which is the subject of the story the thread is based on</i>.<p>* Along comes &#x27;swombat to tell me that I&#x27;m an apologist for the state, a not-credible human being, and at risk of putting my professional reputation in doubt.<p>I think a close reading of the thread will bear my interpretation out, and, more importantly, show how different that interpretation is from the one you provided.",1382821547

6619357,comment,6618758,6618758,2,0,bane,,,"I finally got a chance to visit a couple roundabout heavy countries this past year and absolutely love them.<p>Growing up in the U.S. 4-way stops are terrible congestion sources, nobody follows the rules (right of way), and it&#x27;s generally an irritating experience with all the stopping and going. In my local area there are two interesting stretches of road, on the first there are three close proximity 4-way stops. Traffic is always messed up on them.<p>In the other stretch, there used to be an intersection with only a stop on the access road and then a 4-way lighted stop. In the evenings, traffic heading towards the intersection would back up for 10 miles or more and take an hour to cross the intersection. They decided to replace both intersections with three roundabouts and <i>poof</i>, they haven&#x27;t had a traffic issue in years despite more than tripling the number of cars on the same road.<p>American&#x27;s still don&#x27;t do them quite right, they&#x27;re usually too tight or we put lights all over them defeating the purpose. In a proper roundabout country, they&#x27;re amazing, traffic moves pretty steady, everybody knows what&#x27;s going on, they don&#x27;t really ever feel threatening and if you miss your exit it&#x27;s a pretty easy trip round back to it.<p>I think at some scale level, they start not to work as well as the American solution though (big highway exits and interchanges). Some of the really large ones I drove through <i>were</i> more problematic in terms of getting traffic through, even if navigating was still better. The American method moves more traffic, but at a loss of driver clarity in many cases.",1382821523

3626985,comment,3624856,3625567,6,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>And damn right Adderall is a recreational drug, it makes stuff that is boring fun.</i><p>As a prescribed user of Adderall, I don't agree. The fact that it can be abused doesn't make it a recreational drug, any more than the fact that cocaine can be abused invalidates its use as a clinical anesthetic. With ADHD, the problem is not necessarily inability to focus: indeed, many people with ADHD are capable of hyperfocus and have no difficulty 'pulling an all-nighter.'<p>The problem is that achieving this hyperfocus requires minimizing external distractions to an abnormal (and often impractical) degree. The all-nighter is a good example itself; it may be a lot easier to work through the quiet of the night but there are social, psychological, and physiological costs to doing that all the time. Likewise, working in an office or in a particular location for extended periods during critical projects can be very manageable and productive, but may require attenuating familial or emotional relationships during the period in question. Most people need to perform multiple roles in multiple every day, <i>e.g.</i> parent, homemaker, employee, manager, spouse <i>etc. etc.</i>. It's normal to give total focus to some roles some of the time, but one can't do that constantly without creating serious life imbalances, with negative consequences for both oneself and the people one is connected to.<p>For people with ADHD the mental cost of focus-switching seems to be much higher, because doing so requires constant re-contextualization. Imagine looking at the world through a pair of binoculars or a telephoto lens on a camera. You can see a great deal of detail this way, but shifting your view by more than a few degrees requires re-orienting your view around the new object of attention. With an optical device you can move it away, look at the wider picture, and easily establish your new point of focus. But if you didn't have that option, then re-orienting oneself would be more time-consuming. If your point of view were being shifted about by external forces on a regular basis, it would be problematic. Likewise, navigating a ship or following a map is simple in principle, but changing weather conditions or inaccuracies on the map can make the task considerably more difficult. My experience of using Adderall is not that it makes dull activities fun or effortless, but more that it provides a relatively consistent mental reference point against which one can calibrate one's model of external priorities. In programming terms, it's like the difference between having pointers and having to use global variables.",1330034272

3626975,comment,3625710,3626058,6,0,drostie,,,"This is a valid criticism, and if you wanted to really make the case you'd say I think, ""think about every time you have ever written an anonymous class. That anonymous class was probably an ugly closure."" So Java programmers basically already know that if you want to list your MP3s you might have to write:<p><pre><code>    String[] mp3s = new File(""/home/drostie/Music"").list(new FilenameFilter() {\n        public boolean accept(File dir, String name) {\n            return (name.length > 4) && (\n                name.substring(name.length - 4).toLowerCase() === "".mp3""\n            );\n        }\n    });\n</code></pre>\nIn Node.js this becomes:<p><pre><code>    var mp3s = fs.readdirSync(""/home/drostie/Music"").filter(function (name) {\n        return name.slice(-4).toLowerCase() === "".mp3"";\n    });\n</code></pre>\nBut as you said, this doesn't use the environment. The question is, when do you really need the environment?<p>One answer is that it's usually important when that environment is changing and you're modifying that environment; then you have to worry, ""Am I modifying the right value? Do I have the right value?"" And that's a much more difficult case. MIT's Abelson-Sussman lectures are very clear when talking with Scheme about assignment. ""Why do you care about assignment? Because sometimes you want new Date(), or Math.random(), or any number of other constructs which <i>don't</i> return the same thing when you call them twice in a row.""<p>There are some simple use cases for this, like tracking how much work you're doing. In client-side JavaScript you might write something like this:<p><pre><code>    var el_text_area = document.getElementById(""wordbox""),\n        el_charcount = document.getElementById(""charcount""),\n        clock;\n    \n    el_text_area.onblur = function () {\n        // stop updating when the user isn't typing.\n        if (clock !== undefined) {\n            clearInterval(clock);\n        }\n    };\n    \n    el_text_area.onfocus = function () {\n        el_text_area.onblur(); //clear the clock if it somehow already exists.\n        clock = setInterval(function () {\n            el_charcount.value = el_text_area.value.length;\n        }, 50);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nAll of those external variables are being dynamically modified.<p>The last case where I really used closures was as a debugging tool; I wrote a function which would take as input a function and 'wrap' it up for tracing its execution. Here it is in its full gory detail:<p><pre><code>    function log_call(fn) {\n        var count = 0;\n        return function () {\n            var out, name = fn.name + ""#"" + (count += 1);\n            function log(verb, value) {\n                console.log(name + "" "" + verb + "" "", value);\n            }\n            log(""<--"", [].slice.call(arguments, 0));\n            try {\n                out = fn.apply(this, arguments);\n                log(""-->"", out);\n                return out;\n            } catch (e) {\n                log(""--X"", e);\n                throw e;\n            }\n        };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI use it by writing code like this:<p><pre><code>    function fibs(n) {\n        return n <= 1 ? n : fibs(n - 2) + fibs(n - 1);\n    }\n    // fibs seems slow, let's see what's going on here\n    fibs = log_call(fibs);\n    \n    //later in the code\n    fibs(22);\n</code></pre>\nThe above code is in fact horribly inefficient, and gets to fibs#57313 before it starts to construct the Fibonacci numbers. The debug trace shows all of this, if you run it.<p>We can solve that by now defining a caching decorator:<p><pre><code>    function cached_onearg(fn) {\n        var cache = {};\n        return function (x) {\n            var out;\n            if (cache.hasOwnProperty(x)) {\n                return cache[x];\n            } else {\n                return (cache[x] = fn.call(this, x));\n            }\n        };\n    }\n    fibs = log_call(cached_onearg(function (n) {\n        return n <= 1 ? n : fibs(n - 2) + fibs(n - 1);\n    ));\n</code></pre>\nThe logger now shows a much more reasonable 43 calls.",1330034147

3626942,comment,3624714,3625645,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sorry, but this is flat out wrong.<p>The Tsar Bomba was a 100 MT bomb, period. It was capable of being used in 50 MT configurations but there was absolutely, positively zero chance that the 100 MT configuration would not work. Additionally, the 100 MT version would not have been a significantly different weight or size.<p>The reason for the 50 MT / 100 MT difference is that such weapons use a mix of fission and fusion reactions. In a thermonuclear weapon you can use natural Uranium (U-238) as a jacket around the fusion fuel capsule. While U-238 doesn't normally participate in a fission chain reaction it will fission when under high neutron flux and as it turns out fusion bombs generate enormous amounts of neutrons. Thus typical thermonuclear weapons leverage the fusion reactions to drive fission reactions and boost yield enormously, resulting in most of the energy from a ""thermonuclear"" weapon ultimately coming from fission reactions.<p>The downside of this is that fission reactions are very dirty. And in the case of the Tsar Bomba design that meant that testing the design at a full 100 MT yield would result in 50 MT worth of nuclear fission fallout being spread across the Soviet Union (and ultimately the world of course). Which is rather quite a lot of fallout. By replacing the jackets around the 3rd stage fusion fuel capsules with different materials that do not undergo fission the result is that the fusion reactions still proceed, and the bomb still releases 50 MT of energy, but very little energy comes from fission (the primary, parts of the secondary and the spark plugs in the tertiary stages), massively reducing fallout.<p>The part about the pilots not having enough time to get to a safe distance from a 100 MT explosion is true, but aside from that had the Soviets wanted to they could have done a 100 MT test of Tsar Bomba quite readily.",1330033662

Both Windows and Mac/iOS developers would use less useful tools if they still let them make products for the popular platforms. JetBrains, Borland and others are fighting for attention and developers' love. They must try really-really hard to make people choose an alternative to the official tools.<p>So both MS and Apple teams may focus on what is ""right"" and avoid feature bloat in UI, avoid quick and dirty solutions etc. Yes, they must include some features quickly and efficiently to allow support for some new APIs in the new products. But the overall design and fit and finish is free to define however they want. They can spend time making it right and redoing it how they please. They have resources and expertise for that and they don't need be in a stressing ""competition"" mood.<p>I'm really disappointed by what Microsoft did with Visual Studio. They have great technology - great language, great compiler support and integration with editors. But the way it is all presented and organized is all boring mess of panels and tons of icons. They even understand all the icons are heavy for eyes, but instead of <i>rethinking</i> the design, they simply ask ""40 existing and 36 new VS users"" how do they like monochrome versions.<p>Apple's Xcode 3 was also a messy window/panel cluttered tool like many others. Many still considered it lighter than any other complex IDE, but it was fairly cluttered on its own. Next version, Xcode 4 was not designed by ""asking developers"". Developers want a pink pony and all the features in one click. Xcode 4 was <i>designed</i>. They made priorities and straightened UI so much it is now Plain Straight. One window, three panes, 7 buttons on toolbar. Just by learning a single screenshot with both sidebars opened, you already know how to navigate 80% of the time. It is crucial. You don't have to read huge manual to learn more and more useful things. They all are discoverable over time. Most important things are more visible, others are discovered over time.<p>Apple and Microsoft are rarely in position to throw old stuff out and replace it with brand new in their actual products that make money. Windows, Mac, iOS all have its legacy which must be dealt with. But UI for developer tools are different and Microsoft has no excuse not to make it interesting.

It was found that combinations of few characteristics often combine in populations to uniquely or nearly uniquely identify some individuals. Clearly, data released containing such information about these individuals should not be considered anonymous. Yet, health and other person-specific data are publicly available in this form. Here are some surprising results using only three fields of information, even though typical data releases contain many more fields. It was found that 87% (216 million of 248 million) of the population in the United States had reported characteristics that likely made them unique based only on {5-digit ZIP, gender, date of birth}. About half of the U.S. population (132 million of 248 million or 53%) are likely to be uniquely identified by only {place, gender, date of birth}, where place is basically the city, town, or municipality in which the person resides. And even at the county level, {county, gender, date of birth} are likely to uniquely identify 18% of the U.S. population. In general, few characteristics are needed to uniquely identify a person.""",1330032460

This could be cool."" Here's the original email (screen grab from my NeXT machine): <a href=""http://www.fortuityconsulting.com/images/barlow.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fortuityconsulting.com/images/barlow.gif</a><p>I emailed TimBL and told him I'd asked my editors to let my co-editor and I write about it. TimBL was enthusiastic but warned me, ""We have to avoid any embarrassment about CERN code being 'given away for free' when developed with European taxpayers' money. We are working on this but don't say anything in print about how one gets hold of the code without checking for latest developments first!"" Here's the original email from TimBL: <a href=""http://www.fortuityconsulting.com/images/timbl.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fortuityconsulting.com/images/timbl.gif</a><p>TimBL had no reason for concern -- my editors decided the story was not newsworthy and we never ran the piece.<p>I was working on a book proposal at the time, titled ""Plugging Into the Planet,"" which introduced the Internet and explained how computer users could get connected to Usenet, Gopher, and WAIS. I added a section on the WWW. Random House, Bantam, and other major publishers turned it down. I was told books about modems didn't sell well.<p>When I saw TimBL's announcement, I felt it was an important project and worthy of notice. Still, I thought that calling it the WorldWideWeb was vainglorious; after all, how worldwide was it really, running on the handful of NeXTs that had Internet connections? It wasn't until John Markoff's December 1993 article in the New York Times describing NCSA Mosaic for Windows that popular interest in the web burgeoned. Even then, there were very few ISPs, modems were slow, and there was no easy way to create and serve web pages.

However, physorg needs to take some of the heat here because they pick the background, fonts, and colors for the ad insert (not the bolding). So they consciously choose to make their ads look like copy and that is unethical.",1330030935

When they finally locate the mythical Heart of Wallmart, it turns out it just a mirror.  In other words, the problem is not Wallmart (or Google, or whatever), it is us.<p>On another note, games (in general) are not so bad (although the ones they were advertising probably were).  Even the games many people might view as mindless (such as your average FPS) are actually deeply embedded with strategy.  I actually <i>learned</i> a lot from games - not just strategy or spacial intelligence or hand eye coordination, but many of the same things I would have learned if I picked up a science fiction or fantasy book.  Children today are glued to screens, and I think the only cure may be to embrace this and find a better way to use games as educational tools.",1330030815

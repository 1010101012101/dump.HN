In my own experience, that was something that potential VCs wanted, either in place or in place shortly after financing happened.<p>Also interesting that the new governing board has (as far as I can see) zero medical expertise.  The medical advisory board is still odd given Theranos&#x27; technology: Simons makes sense with a background in hematology, but Helfet doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense as an orthopedic trauma surgeon, nor does Frist (a carry-over from the old board) as a cardiothoracic surgeon, nor does Foege (another carry-over) as an epidemiologist.

And it might be subverted.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think it is easy to achieve verifiability to be above nitpicking of the kind we&#x27;re seeing here.&quot;<p>The most basic verifiability for open HW is to use components that have documented, open HDL with rest of what was produced open for 3rd party verification. Gaisler already did it for a CPU and whole IP library. Rocket RISC-V team did their part. Magic-1 guy did it with wire-wrap on TTL chips. None of these people had $10+ million. Gaisler shows it was just a matter of getting money together to do the development cost-effectively, licensing to commercial users to sustain it, ensuring any I.P. could be re-synthesized for new use cases, and simply offering source for re-synthesis or just verification.<p>Now, we can go much further than that and tools like Qflow OSS Synthesis are a step in that direction. However, most likely approach given EDA complexity is doing it with industry standard tools with third parties checking those results. Might even do it totally in high-end tools but in a way that end result can be verified to large degree with open tools. Many ways to do that but all need work. Good news is that there&#x27;s no Snowden leaks, etc suggesting EDA tools are subverted. That helps. :)<p>So, you&#x27;re creating one strawman after another to justify either (a) not trying or (b) calling something open that&#x27;s not. The minimal requirement has been done repeatedly in other projects by other people. It takes no extra money on top of a normal HW development. It can even be done both proprietary and open source as Gaisler illustrated for some of his stuff. The result merely has to be open and done in a way that 3rd parties can verify. Optionally, that they can integrate and put on fab of choosing if they desire.<p>That&#x27;s minimum for open-source hardware. A project does the minimum, I call it open-source hardware. If it is not doing it, I&#x27;m calling it something else. I&#x27;m calling a project that heavily depends on black boxes from DOD-connected and scheming companies as opposite of open in operation as is possible. If the board is open, I&#x27;ll call it an open-board or open-PCB design. Novena seems to be an open-board system with OSS software. It&#x27;s not open HW.",1446134192

Most of the book in which he describes his third law, Harmonices Mundi, is concerned with astrology, music theory, and (for lack of a better word) mysticism.<p>An excerpt from the Wikipedia article gives a flavor:<p>&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<p>While medieval philosophers spoke metaphorically of the &quot;music of the spheres&quot;, Kepler discovered \nphysical harmonies in planetary motion. He found that the difference between the maximum and minimum \nangular speeds of a planet in its orbit approximates a harmonic proportion. For instance, the maximum \nangular speed of the Earth as measured from the Sun varies by a semitone (a ratio of 16:15), from mi \nto fa, between aphelion and perihelion. Venus only varies by a tiny 25:24 interval (called a diesis in \nmusical terms).[6] Kepler explains the reason for the Earth&#x27;s small harmonic range:<p>&quot;The Earth sings Mi, Fa, Mi: you may infer even from the syllables that in this our home <i>mi</i>sery and \n<i>fa</i>mine hold sway.&quot;[9]<p>The celestial choir Kepler formed was made up of a tenor (Mars), two bass (Saturn and Jupiter), a \nsoprano (Mercury), and two altos (Venus and Earth). Mercury, with its large elliptical orbit, was \ndetermined to be able to produce the greatest number of notes, while Venus was found to be capable of \nonly a single note because its orbit is nearly a circle.[6]<p>At very rare intervals all of the planets would sing together in &quot;perfect concord&quot;: Kepler proposed \nthat this may have happened only once in history, perhaps at the time of creation.[10] Kepler reminds \nus that harmonic order is only mimicked by man, but has origin in the alignment of the heavenly bodies:<p>&quot;Accordingly you won’t wonder any more that a very excellent order of sounds or pitches in a musical \nsystem or scale has been set up by men, since you see that they are doing nothing else in this business \nexcept to play the apes of God the Creator and to act out, as it were, a certain drama of the ordination \nof the celestial movements.&quot; (Harmonice Mundi, Book V).[6]<p>&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;<p>We had a very interesting colloquium in my astronomy department a few years back by someone from the music department who had studied Kepler&#x27;s musical theories in great detail.  Evidently his musical theories have inspired a few modern composers.

Billing is purely on energy consumption. The effect of this is that low electric users get subsidized by high electric users.<p>When someone installs a domestic solar system they reduce their payments, but they still depend on the grid infrastructure. The system reaches its ultimate perversion when a grid tied domestic user achieves a negative bill. Not only have they been paid for their energy, they have been paid for the utility having a grid.<p>You can solve this economic distortion by a couple of ways:<p>• split billing into a grid-tie fee and an energy consumption charge: This accurately covers the solar houses, but it also raises the bills of the poor and cuts those of the wealthy (generally larger consumers).<p>• only pay domestic solar producers half what you charge for power: This works out asymptotically for a huge producer where the grid portion vanishes, but it doesn&#x27;t work for people reducing their consumption but maintaining a grid tie or selling a little bit.<p>• put a surcharge on each watt of solar capacity: This works out accurately, but feels abusive. 1 watt of solar panel is going to make about 100 wHr of power a month. If grid-tie privilege includes a surcharge to cover the grid portion of 100wHr then this 1 watt solar panel user will end up paying the same for the grid as he did before. If a domestic solar installation is a net producer, it will end up getting paid for the energy and the grid fees will cancel.<p>Even before we get to a point where the power company may say &quot;no thank you&quot; to a domestic user that wants to sell power at 1pm on a sunny day, we still need to straighten out the billing. The current system ends up with the utilities (and by extension all grid users) subsidizing solar installations by forgiving their grid costs. I&#x27;m in favor of that now, but in a future where our carbon emissions are under control the distortions will need to be smoothed out.",1446133675

Smaller creatures, with lesser access to resources and higher mortality rates, invest less in more children.<p>A rabbit doe can theoretically have 480 offspring, at 12 per litter, 10 times per year, over 4 years.

It&#x27;s important to be aware of just how bad things can get in technical interviews.<p>However, much as I&#x27;m always game for a good horror story, I&#x27;m more interested in the damage that the ordinary, polite, courteous technical interview/exam may be inflicting on people and our industry.<p>As I&#x27;ve posted in the past, I believe that tech interviews are essentially entrance exams that software developers are forced to take over and over.  Actuaries, for instance, take exams on topics that correlate closely with mathematics classes, like numerical analysis or vector calc and linear algebra.  These exams are recognized for what they are - rigorous entrance exams to show competency in core subjects.  We don&#x27;t call these exams &quot;interviews&quot; and leave it to an some dude who sits in cubicle D-12 to decide how he feels like testing an experienced Actuary&#x27;s understanding of integration by parts today.<p>The reason I prefer to focus on the polite, respectful, professional interviews is that it helps us see the fundamental problems with our approach, rather than the misbehavior that can occur in any interview situation.  I do think that the intense technical interviews in our field have taken the place of the bar, the actuarial exams, the medical boards.  However, most professional entrance exams adhere to a code of conduct - students have an associated study path, they get a respected credential (reassuring their peers and hiring managers that they really do possess this knowledge and ability), they are aware of who their examiners will be and are assured that they possess the proper credentials and expertise to conduit the exams properly, fairly, and most of all, <i>consistently</i>.<p>I really would like to see developers, as a profession, determine how our competence will be established relative to our peers.<p>Now, one more thing - I said that I prefer to focus on the polite interviews than the horror stories, but I absolutely do acknowledge that a process like tech interviews may be unusually prone to these horror stories.  In short, horror stories like this may not be entirely orthogonal to the core issues, they may very much be a common side effect.<p>Instead of highly respected practitioners and acknowledge experts sitting on a board, we go grab a few developers and hope they know what they&#x27;re doing.  When I defended my MS project, Berkeley didn&#x27;t go out and grab a few people who seem to know the industry well enough (uh, I guess, oh, he&#x27;s busy, well, this other dude seems pretty good, have him sit in) and have them decide whether I would receive a degree.  I&#x27;m not saying there is no variance among experts, some may pass you, others may not, without question.  But I could be certain that the people on my committee were qualified to evaluate my work, that I had rights as a student sitting for an exam, and I would receive a lasting and meaningful credential with feedback (not just a &quot;we&#x27;ve decided not to proceed with your application at this time, but we&#x27;ll keep your resume…).<p>With such a capricious and chaotic process, yeah, the sort of thing described here is more likely to happen.",1446133215

The military industrial complex works to serve itself, and it will invent or even create and support enemies if those enemies can be used against the public to push a bigger budget. (See Operation Gladio A and B)<p>The thing to realize though is that the threat is from hard to find potentially non-nationstate actors, and the threat is somewhat real, but it is hard to detect and creates a constant state of fear... which is great if you want to capitalize on that fear. To a certain extent it worked for a better good by bringing tons of money into America which along with the UK and Israel is one of the top arms suppliers to the world. (a great intro book on this subject is the updated <i>The Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade</i>.)<p>My problem is that this model of fear and money has been taken to the extreme is now eroding freedoms at home, and bankrupting us. Many republicans will rant and rave about the budget, but if you ask about cutting waste, fraud, and abuse (WFA) in DoD/Pentagon they hardly ever admit such WFA exists (even though everyone actually familiar with it knows how excessive it is, especially at the Pentagon.)<p>The other problem is that secretly, unbeknownst to you or the general public, in the smokey closed door places in the Beltway, the strategic thinkers have been saying we are returning to a neo-cold war, and to the tripolar world, and thats the real reason for our expansionism... used a measure of containment against our future enemies, (Russia and China) in the upcoming resource wars.

I think that the fact that Gen X and the Millenials have been less economically secure than preceding generations (reversing the trend toward greater security) means that increasingly, people are focused on more immediate, personal concerns. Plus, to the extent that there is a concern for broader, global environmental issues, the focus has been climate change rather than overpopulation (the two concerns overlap considerably, but climate change is more specific and concrete than generalized carrying capacity concerns.)<p>> At our current rate (ignoring the projected gradual reduction) we&#x27;ll double every 65 years.<p>And, IIRC, in the mid-1960s, that was about 32 years.

The senior guy you ask to help you sponsor the bill which is only 10 pages long then says he will support you if you add an amendment that says X, even that amendment has nothing to do with the main bill, and he has been donated money or promised campaign support by $KSTREETGROUP. If you say no, you get derailed, the bill never leaves committee, and you have made an enemy. You agree, and then the floodgates are open for 10 other sitting house members to throw in their amendments too. Before you know it, your bill is 250 pages and they removed all your original text and it&#x27;s no longer your bill. If you rock the boat, you make enemies and forever get shoved aside. Agree and support the bill <i>you introduced</i>, that is actually now bad legislation, and all those people say they will help you next time.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s more of the, <i>this bill has to pass, so we can add all kinds of little tidbits and the public won&#x27;t know about them in time to stop it!</i>. Then you might have a guy or two who actually put that tidbit in vote no just so he has some plausible deniability to his constituents who don&#x27;t know any better because reports on the hill suck these days.<p>We need to get rid of excessive riders, last minute riders on big bills, extend time for public review, and give power back to congress/senate to take stances without being pushed over politically. The thing is that the lobbyist will mostly just promise to get the guy fired if they push back too much, or they will then donate to another guy who&#x27;s been in for 18 years and get him to put the pressure on. If we put short term limits (and I don&#x27;t mean 12 years, I mean 6 year limits) then you can get people who will do stuff and not care about getting booted out, because they never had the intention to turn it into a lifetime job in the first place.<p>Also, we need to stop the revolving door between the hill and k-street. Staffers should not be allowed to turn around and go work for them, as Jack Abramoff put it, once he promised a staffer a job, he found out that they would do more for him than he even asked them to do!<p>We have a broken system, and until we address these fundamental problems, all the other issues people are passionate about will never get fixed properly.

Negativity.&quot;<p>Irrelevant: nobody suggested perfection. Matter of fact, all I suggested was for the project to deliver on its stated goal or articles on it modify their statements to reflect reality. Many projects accurately portray their capabilities without financial incentive at all. So, I&#x27;m sure this one can, too.<p>&quot;Fully open hardware is never going to be quite as achievable as open source software because the manufacturing and distribution costs cannot be driven to zero in the same way. &quot;<p>Fully open hardware has been achieved many times. It just hasn&#x27;t been achieved at the desktop or laptop level. QED.<p>&quot;Openness remains a minority interest, and therefore the NRE cost amortized in every unit is going to be higher. Signs of people being willing to pay for open hardware (the original designers who did the development, not the cloners who didn&#x27;t) are scarce.&quot;<p>Now you have a real problem. You have to get the costs down or just drop the goal entirely.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not even an unachievable amount of money that would be required to do a fully open CPU+GPU by paid professionals. $10m at the bottom end. Much smaller than, say, the Star Citizen kickstarter. What&#x27;s unachievable is the community unity of purpose behind it.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s actually easier than you think. All it would take are a number of academic teams, probably less than 10, using their discounted tools and grant money to each produce re-usable parts of a SOC on good process node (eg 45nm CMOS). Think USB, DDR, cache, etc. They&#x27;ve already produced a processor (Rocket RISC-V @ 1.4GHz) and many DSP-style chips up to 160+ cores that can be licensed. Remaining pieces are small plus SOC integration and testing with tooling.<p>I explained all this here:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10468534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10468534</a><p>Using academics for as many projects as possible keeps the EDA, MPW, and labor costs low. They can just public domain everything they build or cheaply license it to commercial projects to fund further development. In it for them is job/tool experience. In just a few years, we&#x27;d have every major component we need. Then, a private company (or another academic team) could put it together as SOC leveraging tools they already bought with funding from their own operations, Kickstarter, grant money, private donors, whatever. Many funding models.<p>So, far from an impossibility, there&#x27;s multiple paths to get to the SOC&#x27;s, DSP&#x27;s, or FPGA&#x27;s needed for open-source HW. A good chunk of it is already built, some open-sourced, and some just described in papers with enough detail to copy. There&#x27;s teams all over the world with skills, tools, and funding that can be motivated to do it. So, enough excuses: start cold calling on them. :)<p>And things like Novena can present themselves accurately in meantime as huge, black-boxes from scheming companies that are connected together in an open-source way. Seeing it that way, though, might make people concerned with their security less likely to buy it. Re-purposed embedded boards are probably a lot safer. :)",1446131388

Unless you personally know the OP, you have no idea what the OP&#x27;s personality is like. Sure, I personally would tear them a new one (civilly) if they treated me like that, but I have non-confrontational friends that would be terrified to escalate the situation like that.",1446130843

It handles backups for your phone, your iPad, plays videos, plays music, handles playlists, acts as a shop etc. etc. etc.<p>Combined with the fact that buttons on iOS no longer look like buttons and text and hints are being replaced by cryptic symbols, and everything is flat so you don&#x27;t know what is text and what responds to behaviour, I think user interaction has suffered and things aren&#x27;t as discoverable as they once were, in general. Not just iTunes.",1446130829

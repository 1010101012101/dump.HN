But from what you described I don&#x27;t think you made this (implicit) assumption clear, and it&#x27;s not clear whether that&#x27;s the sort of business they want to invest in (in the short term, the general platforms will be where the money is made, and it will be the aggregate of the niche platforms - a much more profitable investment than a niche product).",1399553988

I will try to explain a problem:<p>1. suppose there are two layers L0 and L1;<p>2. also there are an object O1 of type T which is used by L0, but pointer A1 to O1 is stored in context C at L1;<p>3. suppose an object O1 was freed, but after a while an object O2 was created at the __same__ address A1;<p>4. suppose a context C still has a pointer to A1 as a pointer to an object ____O1____;<p>5. but A1 doesn&#x27;t have __O1__ anymore, O1 was freed, right now, A1 contains an object O2;<p>6. suppose after a while, L1 call API from L0 and pass A1 as a pointer to an object O1. OOPS! We have a bug at this point and we don&#x27;t even know about it!<p>You may tell that it&#x27;s unusual situation when O2 created exactly at the same address where O1 was stored. But I can answer that L1 may store objects on the array, say `T Os[100];` . In this case that situation is very possible.<p>So I solved this problem by introducing PTRID. In short, ptr_id_t contains address and unique id which is incremented globally.<p>So using PTRID at stage (6) I can catch a bug! See the code.<p>Note that, PTRID is intended to using for intra-layer calls. Don&#x27;t use PTRID everywhere because it&#x27;s a bit costly. Use it for intra-layer calls (i.e. between L0 and L1).<p>I like the following analogy:<p>1. memory address space is one-dimensional space.<p>2. but objects created and freed over the time!<p>3. so it&#x27;s not really good to use one-dimensional pointer in two dimensional space!<p>4. that&#x27;s why PTRID can be imagined as two-dimensional pointer, i.e. a pair (A, T). Where A is address, and T is time (i.e. global ID in my code).",1399553845

7714879,comment,7714400,7714400,16,0,joelmichael,,,"Paradox is not really so alien to Western philosophy, as this article initially suggests. It does end up referencing a number of modern Western philosophers, but the idea is older than that. It&#x27;s ironic he refers to &quot;Western orthodoxy&quot; as being strictly anti-paradox, as traditional Christian theology is full of official paradoxes; a major example would be the doctrine that Jesus is simultaneously fully human and fully divine. Many were declared anathema for refusing this and other paradoxical doctrines. So rather than Western orthodoxy being unaware of paradox, it has insisted on it. The concept of the dialectic also touches on this idea of reconciling apparent contradictions, rather than defeating your opponent as one does in a debate, and this idea originates not truly with Hegel but spans all the way back to Socrates, and probably before.<p>I agree with the sentiment, however, that understanding paradox is extremely important to a person&#x27;s capability for nuance and understanding. If you insist on a simplified internal consistency, you will end up sacrificing (and demonizing) whole parts of your thought process rather than trying to reconcile them as having some truth. It can be a process of self-indoctrination purely to avoid the pain of confusion. Another way to think of paradox is simply rejecting false dichotomies in favor of a more complex and uncertain reality. I don&#x27;t think the lesson here is to &quot;break the chains of Aristotelian logic&quot; (God forbid) but rather, well, reconcile it with the idea of paradox.",1399551540

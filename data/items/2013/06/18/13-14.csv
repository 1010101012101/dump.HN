Anyway, the guy just thought GIRL = Macbook Air. No further analysis needed. Only when I showed up and talked to the guy did he back off... We talked about how strange it was that we needed to strong arm a salesman into paying more. Truly hard selling us on less.

I can see why more companies don&#x27;t use it for public clouds-- you do run into a few weird edge cases with containers vs. full VMs and these would be a tech support issue for a large-scale hosted. But the density you achieve with it is at least one order of magnitude better than KVM, possibly two, and the performance is also better. There is zero I/O overhead since you are in fact running bare-metal, so it&#x27;s very good for high-performance computing (one of our use cases).<p>Most of the edge cases you do encounter are due to poorly-written software. The most common thing is server software that depends on Linux&#x27;s default overcommit behavior and malloc() never failing and then uses that to try to badly implement a memory-sensitive cache in competition with the kernel. Containers change overcommit behavior and malloc() CAN fail, so such software will eat all the memory in a container and barf. But there are hacks to get around this, and it&#x27;s mostly an issue with POS rube goldberg machine web stacks like Apache/mod_php.<p>I&#x27;ve been following LXC for a while and see that some people are now using it in production.

5898980,comment,5897458,5898330,1,0,Dewie,,,"You&#x27;re using my mention of the Hard difficulty as a springboard to talk about something totally different? My point was that God of War is not so easy as to cruise through the whole game on the harder difficulties (and if it is then I guess you are very familiar with and good at hack-and-slash games).<p>> The big thing on most modern games is the frequent auto-checkpointing. This is done to prevent the player from becoming frustrated and walking away, but it saps a critial element of difficulty from the game in that you have to execute a series of hard maneuvers all in sequence, and screwing up anything puts you back at the beginning.<p>&quot;Executing a series of hard maneuvers all in sequence&quot; is not a good design for a lot of games. It is good for those &quot;match the button pressing to the prompts on the screen&quot; (ala Guitar Hero) and classical platformers, but not for stealth and/or strategy games. It isn&#x27;t very satisfying for me when it comes to hack-and-slash games, eiher, because it de-emphasizes reaction and adapting to novel situations.<p>Frequent check-pointing is often a crutch to mask poor gameplay design, but the tedium of having to do a series of perfectly executed actions is often a design that screams &quot;we didn&#x27;t bother to come up with something really satisfying&quot;.<p>> Modern games are very guilty of the overuse of checkpointing, which can frequently mean that you never lose more than a few seconds of progress. The frustration of doing 98% of a boss fight, flubbing one guard, and having to replay the whole level again is mirrored in the reward you feel when you overcome the challenge; modern games frequently minimize frustration via checkpointing, overly-verbose tutorials, &quot;look here!&quot; neon signs, and the like, all of which reduce both frustration and satisfaction.<p>No, the frustration is not nearly worth it. Using hours on one level - and the crushing boredom of having to repeat the first 25% of the same god damn level 50 times - does not culminate in some triumphant feeling when everything eventually falls into place. Maybe for something like 10 seconds, but that was hardly worth the frustration. Maybe that&#x27;s just me, not being a masochist and all.<p>Games shouldn&#x27;t try to hold your hand in order to frustrate you - it shouldn&#x27;t try to hold your hand because it is satisfying to figure things out more by yourself. It will only frustrate you if you are too impatient <i>or</i> if the developers designed the game with poor hinting towards what you should do. And not holding your hands demands better design - or else the frustration is magnified. If you bang your head against the wall for hours, trying every reasonable way (within the confines of the game) to get further ahead, and you only find out about it through reading some FAQ (Or those Nintendo Magazines) that you should balance on the pixel-wide rope, make a jump on the night of the lunar moon and press square - or any other way that doesn&#x27;t make reasonable intuitive sense within the games universe - that is a <i>failure</i> on the part of the designers, not some &quot;hardcore&quot; feature of the game.<p>I guess the hard games of old are kinds of badges of honor for some people (having completed them). I guess suburbanites who grew up during the nineties has to have their battle stories, too.",1371561991

Some points are clearly valid: use modern crypto primitives if you can, and know their properties. But things are more complicated than that.<p>First, even if you say that proofs are enough, you got to know what you&#x27;re proving. The problem is that, AFAIK, most security properties are actually defined as absence of a particular attack (or a class thereof). Thus knowing the properties you want to achieve is equivalent to knowing the attacks you want to avoid. In other words, even if I build my system to have a property A, I might not know that I also need to attain property B (thus securing it against the complement of B).<p>Second, if you do want actual proofs, well, good luck. You start off with the indistinguishability stuff, which is not easy in itself. Toss in the distributed aspects of Internet applications and you&#x27;ve got yourself a proper mess. Case distinctions abound, this stuff slowly crosses into the domain of intractable. If you look at the game-based security proofs, well, for anything non-trivial, who can really be confident that the proofs are correct? Machine verification would help, but our tools are both still too weak, and still only a domain of select few specialists.<p>Third, even if you do get your proofs, well, more likely than not, these are going to be based on a simplified model which will sweep a lot of stuff under the rug. E.g. I don&#x27;t know of works which address things like timing attacks in anything of even remotely practical value. And there&#x27;s a bunch of other stuff, keys distributed, management, etc.<p>Lastly, as lot of other commenters have pointed out, you are also more likely than not to deal with existing codebases at some point, where you might end up plugging the holes rather than constructing.",1371561545

The reality is that due to the FISA Amendments Act and its section 702 authorities, Americans communications are collected and viewed on a daily basis on the certification of an analyst rather than a warrant.

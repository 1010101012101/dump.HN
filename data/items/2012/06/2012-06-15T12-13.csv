He gives a set of things you can do to calm the situation down, but I don't get the feeling that he knows why.<p>First, people want to know that you understand them.  Repeating back what they said helps.  But even better is to rephrase what they said, so that they know you understand.  And if you don't understand, that can be corrected before you go any further.<p>Second, people want you to listen.  Once you've established that you understand, repeating everything back is really, really annoying to both sides.  Gentle noises show you're still listening, if you use them at the right time.  You may have to return to repeating if things get complicated.<p>Third, you identify their problem so that they can see it clearly.  In this case, he's labeling their emotions, which is just part of the problem.  But it could lead to them realizing that they need to fix it in a way that relieves that emotion.  ""It would be nice if there was another way to do that"" is another way, but the other option can't be too obvious or it comes out as sarcasm.<p>And last, you either solve their problem, of let them solve it on their own, inception-style.  You've led them by the nose to the problem in part 3, and now it's time to let them solve it.  If they just can't, you'll have to help them with the solution a bit.<p>Until this point, I guess I didn't understand just how little of this other people understood.  I've been empathizing with people for years and helping them solve their problems.  It was especially helpful when I was doing phone tech support, but continues to be helpful in software development and personal relationships.<p>When you get good at this, you don't even think about what you're doing.

For example - in my daily work I've used math more complicated than computing average/sum of numbers only a few times in 5 years. Once it was geometry on a plane when writing code for pathfinding in a warehouse (great fun :) ), other times it was mostly to calculate amounts of goods based on something (mostly converting units, calculating volumes, etc - basic stuff).<p>My hobby is wrtiing games, mostly 2d, but I've tried doing 3d too, and there you use math much more often. Mostly 2d/3d geometry, integration for game physic (for most purposes naive Euler integration suffices, and it's really simple, you can invent it without knowing about physics, nor what integral is, but still - it's math). Also requires math - collision checking, ai, space indexing, pathfinding.<p>When optimizing something, basic statistic is handy, but not required.

The value of that may be questionable given that 10k can do most of the stuff you'd be doing with the Ferrari but that's besides the point. The point is that the manufacturer found some way of <i>spending</i> your money on the <i>product</i>.<p>The problem with recruiting is that they have no way of spending your money in any decent way.

But the article also says that many of Apple's decisions are making their laptops less recyclable - even if the actual materials they're being made from are more so. This is a serious issue that people should care about.<p>People should also care about not being able to replace their batteries. Even if the rest of the hardware remains useful after 2, 3 or even 4 years, a battery is a consumable. It gets used up. In the article, it says the original Macbook Air was rated for 300 charges. That's not a lot, and since you can't replace it, you're going to find yourself buying a new laptop in 2 or 3 years even if the rest of the hardware would have lasted 5 or 6 years.

At first we were pretty dismayed and annoyed to see that somebody had patented the concept (we never looked into exactly <i>what</i> the patent covers), though one of the guys we were working with has connections in the Coldplay management team and assured us its fine for us to continue.<p>But then we thought about it some more and realised that we didn't need to, that the coldplay wristbands have some flaws (for what we wanted to do with them) that we can better tackle in other ways. Our goals are very different from Coldplays anyway - they seem to be using their wristbands more to make the DVD look awesome than to please the crowd present (though theres obviously some of that too). Our goal was always interactivity and engaging the crowd in more direct ways.<p>So we cooked up a similar concept which is not only <i>more</i> suited to interacting with the crowd, but also less expensive to produce. So win-win.<p>The wristbands are cool and maybe we'll still do something with that (depending on the patents of course - the Xylobands don't really do exactly what we want, so we'd probably want to build our own anyway) but we did the startup thing and pivoted and came up with something better (for our purposes).<p><i>The laptop would be connected by cable to a transmitter box and antenna. These are supplied by us on a free rental basis with a 500 refundable deposit.</i><p>Our own transmitter cost us about US$20 to build. Sure, it could only be controlled by USB-MIDI (while afaik theirs supports stuff like DMX), but meh, it wouldn't require a 500 deposit.<p>In any case, I'm now repositioning myself as more of a backseat tech consultant for this project rather than hands on engineer as I'm working on an unrelated startup and don't have time to stay involved in the day to day building of audio/visual gadgets, so over the next few weeks I hope to finish off a few more prototype devices and then leave the production up to someone who has a better idea what their doing.",1339763742

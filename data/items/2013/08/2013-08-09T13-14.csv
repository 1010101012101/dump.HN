At least some of them, most notably Google and Facebook, actively allure their users to share more and more of their private data, while misleadingly claiming, that they are able to keep them safe.

I&#x27;d install the software I want on it, and then I&#x27;d physically destroy the USB port.  I&#x27;d want 4 AA batteries, no recharge port.  I guess it would need a camera, as well.  And it would have its own Faraday cage.  And a built-in, non-electronic method that slags the RAM and storage with acid; possibly by pulling a pin out.  I&#x27;d wipe the screen clean, every time I used it.<p>How do I get data out of it?  I drop data into a QR code sending system.  It would generate one full-screen QR-code like image every second or so.  On another computer, I&#x27;d have a camera that I&#x27;d show the device to, and it would read the QR codes, and reconstruct the data.  I can reverse the process to send data to it.  Show it my computer screen, and it decodes the QR codes to a data file.<p>And if I personally wanted to increase the security, I would buy three completely different hardware random generators, XOR their output together, and make a giant One Time Pad.  I&#x27;d invent a way to keep track of where you and I were, in that pad.  (You&#x27;d start at one end, and I at the other.)  I&#x27;d physically copy that data onto my secure-Kindle, and your secure-Kindle, and then physically destroy the random number generating system in its entirety.  (And then destroy the USB port on both Kindles.)  If I ever got a suspicious message from you (re-using One Time Pad, etc.), I&#x27;d slag my secure-Kindle.  And you and I would invent pass phrases that we would use to communicate messages in secret.<p>My secure-Kindle would also have a password to let me power it on.  And it would have one or more dummy passwords.  If I entered a dummy password, the system would act completely normally in every way, but it would secretly insert the phrase &quot;[COMPROMISED, DO NOT TRUST!]&quot; or something like it, in the middle of every message I send.<p>I might need to have the dummy password electronically wipe the system, to help protect you from a government forcing me to decrypt messages you sent me.<p>But I honestly don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a good way to stop this.

Google did not start out reading our mail; their approach was a classic case of the slow-boiled toad (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog</a>).<p>Perhaps you should gain users confidence and trust first by NOT reading their mail and giving them an opportunity to become reliant on the service. At less than 0.50 per piece, postal mail is not so expensive that it weights a risk/benefit analysis in your favor with this model. Most people would probably opt to just continue paying for their mail versus having it read. (Also, not sure people want to create bad friend karma -- ha! -- by having their friends spammed with &quot;junk&quot; mail.)<p>Moving from critiquing to finding a more viable option: I think you can still make money with this upfront by &quot;skinning&quot; the mail with fully printed ad envelopes (obviously with windows for the addresses to show) paid for by general consumer advertisers who don&#x27;t have as much of a need for making sure they are hitting a niche group.<p>Once, and if, you gain a critical mass of users then you could introduce the &quot;read&quot; option with some kind of incentive to get people to opt-in. At least they will trust you more by that time, theoretically. And you could then sign up more advertisers including niche marketers.<p>The current model is not palatable -- unless it were used by a small business/entrepreneur that is sending marketing mail and therefore does not care if it is read (but that then poses a problem of them potentially having a competitor&#x27;s materials inserted with their materials). If the model remains as is I would have to say #schnailmailfail.<p>-Felicia Joy

During the time I did work, I started my own sole trader business, quit my job at a <i>very</i> well known firm who make virtualisation software, and spent time helping him grow his business.<p>He managed to get a few leads, but he relied on me to pull him out of problems. I recall the first time I helped him, it was only as a friend. Basically a large Australian government department had been screwed by a company who printed their paperwork. Their system couldn&#x27;t handle umlauts... Yet they had told that company they handled Unicode. They were telling them that they handled a &quot;subset of Unicode&quot;, which was sneaky because it was actually ISO-8859.1 that they could handle.<p>Later I did some reporting work, which I now see that he entirely left in my hands to sort out with the consultancy company. The state government department didn&#x27;t even entirely know what they wanted. It took me about 3 months to sort out what should have been a 2 week project. It was only when I threatened to quit the reporting project that I was paid.<p>I still believed in the guy, so I helped him sort out an absolute disaster project for him for free with a mining company. I didn&#x27;t ask for any money, as I was doing it as a favour. I managed to make him look awesome and turn it around.<p>Somehow through his existing work for another company, he stole a contract for an important Federal Government department - one that dealt with national security - and I implemented an ITSM solution for them. I fixed up a variety of things that I was never paid for (I fixed an upgrade that had gone terribly wrong and was threatening the project - which I was never involvc I till the last second).<p>Due to my success, I had learned some things about ITIL from my cousin, who is a genius about systems. So I explained to this agencies head of department what I thought about ITIL and where I thought it should go and the importance of the Service Catlog to their organisation. Not only did they get what I was saying, but they asked me in to implement their catalog! At the same time, somehow this guy had managed to get some systems integration work. The catch was the only communications channel, they could use was - wait for it - email!<p>Somehow I made it work.<p>I did a bunch of other work, and I started to help him win big contracts.<p>The final bit of work was with yet another very large, and highly political Federal government department. At this point I had been paid for very little and never offered any share of the company he founded.<p>It all came to a head one night when I stressed out as I was getting into serious debt, hadn&#x27;t seen my kids or wife for some time, and phoned him to tell him I wasn&#x27;t sure I could keep going.<p>His reaction was to cut me off all his IT systems, and then guilted me about not being loyal or reasonable.<p>Eventually he told me, after I had completed a large project to success, that his WIFE wouldn&#x27;t let me be a part of his business. He then tried to tie me into a bunch of contracts, which I declined to sign after he put high pressure on me.<p>I did agree to finish off work for a company I was implementing a solution for, mainly because I didn&#x27;t want to leave him in the lurch, and also because I didn&#x27;t want to let my client down. I had gotten a new part time job so i could do a computer science defree, which I warned him about so he would know when my end date for wrap up would be so he could finish up that project phase so he could implement testing, for which he would employ someone who finalize the project.<p>I then billed him...and waited a few months (I figured he was busy). In fact, I waited 6 months before I sent him an email... To which he told me that he wasn&#x27;t happy with the work, that there had been problems and he had had to redo the work. When I asked for specifics, he refused to tell me. He did say he&#x27;d work out how much he believed he wanted to pay me.<p>I never heard from him again.<p>I have now taken him to a debt collector. He has gone bankrupt and is no longer a director of his company. Instead his father is. His father refuses to pay me. In fact, he claimed he had no statement of work and that I should provide evidence before he would consider payment. What he didn&#x27;t realise was that his son had caused problems for a former business partner, a very very honourable guy who quickly worked out that the son was despicable, and he provided evidence of the work I had done.<p>The father then offered me a fifth of the money owed as a &quot;goodwill gesture ex gratia&quot; payment. The debt collector is less than impressed.<p>The gentleman doesn&#x27;t know it, but I&#x27;m about to wind up his company.<p>In my opinion, the man has no scruples and no conscience. I feel like a fool to have trusted him.<p>Such is my tale of woe... Quite cathartic to get it out there!",1376055195

6185436,comment,6185166,6185166,10,0,e12e,,,"Lots of good answers here. NaCl (salt) is one (relatively) recent effort to be just such a library, see eg under the sub-heading &quot;High Level Primitives&quot; on the features page:<p><pre><code>  http://nacl.cr.yp.to/features.html
 
  High-level primitives

  A typical cryptographic library requires several
  steps to authenticate and encrypt a message.
  Consider, for example, the following typical
  combination of RSA, AES, etc.:

  * Generate a random AES key.
  * Use the AES key to encrypt the message.
  * Hash the encrypted message using SHA-256.
  * Read the sender&#x27;s RSA secret key from
    &quot;wire format.&quot;
  * Use the sender&#x27;s RSA secret key to sign the
    hash.
  * Read the recipient&#x27;s RSA public key from wire format.
  * Use the recipient&#x27;s public key to encrypt the
    AES key, hash, and signature.
  * Convert the encrypted key, hash, and signature to wire
    format.
  * Concatenate with the encrypted message. 

  Sometimes even more steps are required for storage
  allocation, error handling, etc.

  NaCl provides a simple crypto_box function that
  does everything in one step. The function takes the
  sender&#x27;s secret key, the recipient&#x27;s public
  key, and a message, and produces an authenticated
  ciphertext. All objects are represented in wire
  format, as sequences of bytes suitable for
  transmission; the crypto_box function
  automatically handles all necessary conversions,
  initializations, etc.

</code></pre>
Of course, &quot;such libs have bugs&quot; -- it is software after all. But bugs can (and will be) fixed.<p>Somewhat unique to security and cryptography are the number of subtle bugs possible. There are both problems of actual &quot;normal&quot; bugs (like the Debian entropy bug) and system level design errors (like CRIME).<p>NaCl/Salt tries to reduce the number of errors possible by using the library wrong (as opposed to eg: openssl that has a very (some say too) rich interface). But you could still end up writing the secret key to swap. Or doing something silly with the plain text. Or expose yourself to a buffer overflow in the part of the code that renders those cute avatar-images for your chat application.<p>edit: formating",1376054866

It&#x27;s easier to hide and move, but it can be stolen remotely (unlike paper bills). This is a problem and we all are working on different ways to decrease risks. E.g. by having multi-party authorization, &quot;cold storage&quot; (e.g. keys printed on paper), 3rd party services (&quot;banks&quot;), hardware wallets.<p>Not real issues:<p>- &quot;No authentication for IP transfers&quot; - not an issue, no one uses it. If you need to authenticate payment address, either get it over HTTPS, or use upcoming (in 0.9) payment API (same principle as with HTTPS, but without HTTP) or any other way that reduces risks of spoofing payment address.<p>- &quot;Energy Consumption&quot; - not an issue. Miners spend as much energy as profitable for them, just like anyone else on the planet. Visa datacenters also consume energy. Who decides how much energy spending is &quot;too much&quot; if everyone spends what they can afford?<p>- &quot;Illegal content in the block chain&quot; - not an issue with Bitcoin, but an external arbitrary threat created by feds. Same applies to unencrypted WiFi connection or someone sending a well-hidden picture in email attachment to you. Also: users are not required to store the blockchain. If you don&#x27;t like a threat of &quot;illegal content&quot;, use lightweight client to keep your keys only.<p>- &quot;Breaking the cryptography&quot; - does not uniquely apply to Bitcoin comparing to, say, PayPal or bank wires. If some algorithm becomes weak, Bitcoin can be upgraded just like your bank&#x27;s SSL certificate can be.<p>- &quot;Double-spending with 51% attack&quot; is getting less economically viable with every single day as more people mine, use or simply know about Bitcoin. Also, it does not affect all the users, but only those with whom attacker transacts. And if that happens once, people would start sending expensive transactions directly to miners they trust to mitigate the issue.<p>- &quot;Coin destruction&quot; is not a problem for society. Everyone&#x27;s money gets more valuable when you lose yours. Divisibility is enough for a long time to come and can be increased on many levels, inside and outside Bitcoin core protocol.

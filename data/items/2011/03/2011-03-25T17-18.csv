It's a bit lighter weight than Real World Haskell, and doesn't have the breadth of practical examples, but I think it makes up for that by being more consistently interesting. I went through LYAH first and then Real World Haskell, and although the latter was very informative and useful, I found it to be painfully dull in certain parts (particularly the chapters that discuss the building of a JSON parser).",1301075944

I agree with what you're saying and I appreciate the feedback.<p>I work for an IT Services provider as a Level II technician and I am in charge of providing a certain service to our clients on a daily basis.  To administer this service I have to take time out of my normal routine of working tickets and sometimes I find it hard to find the time to do that.  My app would make administering this service easier for me, but it would also allow me to pass the duties down to a Level I tech who isn't as busy with working tickets.  There's not a product on the market that does this and I believe that the market is huge as far as IT Services providers goes.<p>Writing this app is all I can think about.

Even from session to session each pitch improves till the final session ends with all the founders feeling confident, and with investors lining up to talk to them.<p>My biggest lessons after demo day are simple: Everyone needs the right coach to be at their best. Raw talent gets you in the door, coaching shapes you, and investor support (monetarily and connections wise) pour rocket fuel on your company. The combination of the three is why YC companies are different. Without the coaching and support of YC, I've seen a few early stagers explode after getting burned by less savvy investors who are trying to ""do the right thing"". I'd say that a lot of other people find mentors and coaches in other places than YC, but that coaching seems to be the difference maker between ""hobby startup with no shot"" and ""thing thing is going to be huge."" It's a way of hacking through a lack of startup experience.<p>The other huge takeaway: Every company founder is probably as uncertain as you are at some point in their company's history. Some of my good new buddies (shouts to the Oracle of Web3.0!!!!

I don't think delaying the release of Honeycomb really qualifies, but that's debatable.<p>The handset manufacturers/carriers do lock down the software. But that's not Google, that's the manufacturers/carriers. When Google is involved (with their flagship devices like the G1 and Nexus devices) the hardware is not locked down at all.<p>I think one of the problems with what you're saying is the conflation of specific hardware, Android, and Google Experience Android. Anyone can take open source Android and put it on any hardware they manufacture. That's open. Some manufacturers can negotiate with Google to put Google Experience Android on their hardware. That's less open, but more open than most/all other platforms. Skyhook can make a deal with anyone making non-Google Experience Android devices they want to. Google Experience Devices still enjoy almost complete freedom in the Android Market, as well as openly distributed APKs (excepting ATT devices).<p>RE Apple and political implications: I disagree with you. Their editorial oversight and the heavy-handed and arbitrary way that they exercise it is political control.<p>RE Apple and censorship: Apple doesn't enable censorship in China. They actively engage in censorship everywhere (through the App Store). I'm sure if Apple had occasion to enable censorship in China, they'd (prudently) do so. (As an aside, Apple has other issues in China.)<p>I'll admit I do like Google and have a warm and fuzzy feeling about them. But I think it's deserved. Google has done some amazing things, some (like the release of Android source) unequivocally open.<p>That said, I do think Google makes some pragmatic decisions sometimes that are compromises of their professed principles. And that does make me angry. I don't reflexively defend those decisions. I do hope that they are pragmatic decisions taken with a long-term view (e.g. working with carriers/manufacturers until Android and specifically Google Experience Android is a sufficient industry power that they can force the industry to open up and allow software freedom).<p>Again, delaying the release of source code to me does not qualify as a breach of principle, and the criticisms thereof strike me as reflexive, and mostly in the two ways I described above.",1301075332

(Hebrews 11:1)<p>That's pretty simple, and secondly, that pretty much lines up with every ""dictionary"" definition of faith -- i.e. a confidence (or an assured belief) in that which cannot be presently assured.  Everything in this world has differing degrees to which we must use faith.<p>When I drive my car, I don't need much reassurance of faith (i.e. confidence in a belief) that when I turn the wheel left, the car is going to make the turn.  (My belief being in the car's ability to make the turn).  However, if you were rationally honest, you would agree that just because the car turned left 1000 times prior, that does not truly give you a reason to be 100% rationally confident that it will continue to do so.<p>Why?  Because the environment and every single factor has changed.  The road is different, the car is older, the wheel bearings may be a little less greased, the tires have worn, the gravel lays differently, the weather is different, thousands of tiny different universal factors have changed, which really forms an entirely unique model for the 1001st left turn you are about to make.  Not to mention, you aren't God, so you have no possible way of knowing all those factors.  The perfect mathematical model exists for determining whether that car will make the turn, but you will never know it, so you can only generalize based on prior experience.  So you go on, ignoring that tiny little chance (using faith -- a confidence in a given outcome) that the car will not perform as expected.<p>Faith is the confidence in an expected (hoped for) outcome, don't make it out to be more than it is.  Some things in this world require larger doses of faith, like whether or not God exists.  Empiricism helps to make faith easier.",1301074876

Reasons I think it's done better than average:<p>- It's not a game. As patio11 notes the competition in that area is incredibly intense. In the last few days I've picked up Angry Birds Rio for free, Galcon for $1, and AirAttack for $3.

It does everything the full version does except for saving pictures and videos. There are no ads, other than a Market link to the full version.<p>- I don't have to spend any time or money on custom artwork.

2369462,comment,2369271,2369271,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think the insight here for entrepreneurs is that 'web' is not 'enterprise'. Microsoft has spent billions targeting 'enterprise' (to compete with the big software players like SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, Etc) which is structured and deployed very differently than 'web' (where big users are Google, Facebook, Etc.)<p>When I worked at NetApp we had customers in both sides of the world, what we discovered was that the 'enterprise' guys often had a cadence, it went something like grow, identify challenges, coast, upgrade, repeat. That cycle was built around taking the latest release of 'big player' software, qualifying it, then putting it into production, growing a bit, figuring out where the problems were, talking with their vendor, waiting, getting a new release and then repeating the cycle. But the cadence at 'web' players was sporadic at best and often frenetic, feature request, test, iterate, feature, iterate, test, coast, coast, coast, feature, feature, feature, test, coast, Etc. As ideas struck the 'web' infrastructure folks they would would immediately implement some sort of prototype or test case, then rapid fire come up with features the infrastructure needed to support to maximize this feature. But sometimes they would go long periods, months, where nothing would change (in the infrastructure side, web pages, UX, etc sure but same servers and storage assets).<p>What I learned from that was that while it was great to have some other company own the burden of the 'base infrastructure' in terms of operational expense (hey you don't need Linux hackers if your not changing stuff at that level, so its a savings in staff etc etc) it imposes a hard limit on the change derivative. What happens if you try to change faster than the infrastructure can change, is that you end up hacking around the limits, and that builds up technical scar tissue that over time slows your mobility still further.<p>So bottom line, you can't continue to pivot faster than your infrastructure, if you're hacking your way around the infrastructure to change, then your ability to change will die by a thousand hacks. If you find your self thinking you need to hack around your infrastructure, listen to that warning and start planning for a more agile base to work from <i>now</i> rather than when we're struggling to keep an old system working while developing a completely new one.",1301074736

Yes.  Are most users very technical?  No.<p>People just want to use their computers to do something, and quickly. Why don't alot of people who aren't comfortable with technology install software?  Well, they have experience that they download something and install it, and suddenly their computer runs like crap or they have a virus.  They have learned they are better off just to leave it be.  That's why so many users just stick with the default.  They install something, they get hosed.  Again and again.  The alternative is to spend a great deal of time determining whether the source is trusted, or official, or whatever.<p>The app store removes that restriction, making it more useful to the -average- user.

That seems to be a lot these days.<p>> I can do whatever I want with my hardware<p>All handset manufacturers lock down the firmware. You can download the source, but you can't do anything without hacking the phone. If that's 'open', then by unlocking my iPhone I can render it just as 'open'. Now you can't even download the source. As for side-loading, the second-largest mobile provider in the US doesn't let you do it at all. How is Android open if Google never calls out the gatekeepers as they strip away the openness?<p>The only substantial way Android can even claim to be 'open' is the lack of editorial control over the software installed on Android phones.

Then (near enough) all software developers have to work for Microsoft. That gives Microsoft a lot of bargaining power against its employees, unionized or ionized. The only way in which the Universal Programmers' Union is better off in this world than in the real one is that Microsoft (having a monopoly) may be under less pressure from the market to sell its software cheaper, and therefore may be better able to pay rent to the unionized programmers. Fair enough, but is there any actual reason to think that that outweighs MS's gain in bargaining power over its employees? (Which exactly parallels the gain in bargaining power over its customers that makes it better able to afford to pay what its employees demand, if that seems worth doing.)",1301072722

We always stand at a point where we can watch both the presentation and the investors watching the presentation, to see how they're reacting to it. And I've probably watched over 700 DDay presentations now.  So by this point I can even predict fairly well which jokes they'll laugh at.",1301072711

- Create close to one new TLD a year.
- Either make it converge to the same logical""namespace"" (what's the difference between .biz and .com?) or make the new TLD highly specialized and charge ""premium"" prices (.mobi).<p>This does not alleviate the ""deficit"". For example, if you own food.com and someone else buys food.biz, you're in conflict. Solution? Offer lots of money for food.biz. Oh, but there is also food.mobi! You company has a mobile app, right? So you try to buy buy food.mobi as well. The system encourages you to hog the domains.<p>What I've described:
- Make a large number of TLDs available at the same time.
- Make them describe the type of content the server works with.<p>This would create a multitude of logical namespaces, which <i>would</i> drive the prices down. If you own food.review and someone else owns food.wholesale, you're not competing for the same name any more. This wouldn't completely remove contention, but it would reduce its intensity.<p>As for remembering domains, I don't see how adding meaningful TLDs would make it harder. Is food.review really harder to memorize than foodreview.com?",1301072697

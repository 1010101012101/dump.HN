""Unbiased courts"" and ""taking things by force from people performing better"" really, really, really shouldn't use the same word. They do currently - equality before the law, and income equality. Facts-based-unbiased-law is obviously a good thing. Take-by-force-from-best-performers, on the other hand...<p>Anyways, I haven't written the ""I reject equality"" piece because of how touchy it'll be, and how I'll have to ultra-carefully craft the arguments to say exactly what I intend to say, and no more or less than that. But I do think a goal of total equality is fundamentally hostile to excellence - excellence, by definition, is better than the rest. At some point, you have to start pushing down on the best if you want everyone to be the same.

So although on paper the JWs and the Black Protestant Churches look similar in terms of income one has to remember that the Black Churches have a significant problem with addiction to drugs and alcohol among their members which contributes to their low income scores.<p>Not smoking or doing drugs frees up more of the JWs disposable income, and the same goes for Mormons not drinking alcohol.<p>Also many JWs have a lower income because many of them only work part-time by choice so that they have more spare time for preaching, a by-product of this is that voluntarily being able to spend less time at work generally means less stress in the family and more time with the children.",1293330796

This is the problem: talking about this issue will get you labeled as being anti-<insert emotive issue here> (health care for veterans in your case).<p>The budget is blowing out for three reasons: Social Security, health care and the military. Of the three only the last is largely discretionary (being the ongoing cost for campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan).<p>When FDR introduced Social Security there was something like 50 working people for every retired person and the average life expectancy was probably only 60 or so. It's a straight money goes in money goes out system with no saving or planning for future spending. Everyone knows this is unsustainable. It's merely a question of when something will change and what. The smart money is on raising the retirement age.<p>Health care costs are spiraling. This is a much more complicated and multi-faceted problem. Personally I think part of the problem is the blank chewue mentality we have to health care. Basically it doesn't matter how much it costs to research and develop pharmaceuticals and medicine, we expect to be provided it. So companies largely ignore the costs.<p>It's a bit like saying to a subcontractor: you can choose to spend as much as you like and I'll pay you a 20% margin on top of that.

2526524,comment,2525621,2526189,1,0,ghshephard,,,"Not necessarily.  Sometimes the better advice is to tell someone to _not_ go to school.  Someone who might be a very effective (and well paid) tradesperson, but has no aptitude for University, would be much better served (and probably less stressed) by entering the workforce as young as possible, becoming a journeyman, and raising through their career without a formal education.  There are at least three reasons for this:<p>1. By entering the workforce as young as possible, total lifetimes earnings (and more importantly, savings) are maximized for a longer period of time.<p>2. If the individual has no aptitude (or desire) for higher education, then there is a very good chance they will neither get the credentials, nor the knowledge that comes with a high level education.<p>3. Even if they did manage to squeak by and, through sheer grit and determination and stubbornness, acquire the higher education - they might now slot themselves into a field of endeavor for which they are singularly not suited for - only to find 10 years after working some white collar position, that they really, really wished they had been in construction/electrician/blacksmith/what have you...<p>Frequently the path to maximizing total lifetime earnings, happiness, impact, and productivity is not through higher education.  I think that there is a lot of observer bias on most of our part, because most of us have gone through at least some post-high school education and would to believe it generally offers value to those who do likewise.<p>I've got a least one friend who really should have never gotten his Computing Science degree.  He is brilliant in ways that I'll never, ever, match - and should be building houses, not trying to work in IT - just not his gig.<p>On the flip side, i have a quite comfortable six figure income, and never completed university - I just have an aptitude for working in IT.<p>I really believe there is a correlation/causation problem with the ""Higher educations leads to Higher Income"" - the one exception being that a Yale/Stanford/Princeton/Harvard/MIT/Ivy League graduate probably raises the ceiling (and position opportunity) for candidates above what someone without those credentials would have.  But now we're talking about the difference between making $150K/year as a mid level manager and $750K/year as a Sr. VP - not as relevant to the masses.",1304882140

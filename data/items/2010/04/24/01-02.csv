Photos, events, links, news, feed, chat, all of it. \nI'd say for the majority of us, it is our main form of communication.<p>Don't forget PG-13, it was us 30+ year olds who built much of the foundation which made Facebook possible. \nWe're thankful to the 40+ who developed the technology and environment for us to do that.<p>Understand the concept of 'Standing on the shoulders of Giants', and you'll have more respect for those who made what you build and dream of today possible.<p>Along the way, you'll hopefully realize age has very little to do with anything.

You have never really used Facebook, which is why almost all the comments on here about Facebook are so bad. You sound like old people screaming at kids to get off the yard. If you were a real Facebook user (hundreds of photos documenting years of your life), you wouldn't be able to just quit like that over something like this. I seriously don't understand why anybody over 30 even bothers to write things about Facebook, something that isn't meant for them, and something they clearly don't understand.<p>Old wantrepreneurs on here are so bitter about Facebook's success. I remember someone giving career advice actually recommending Google over Facebook. You have to be completely out of touch to even think such a thing. Google is yesterday's news. They are a bloated company filled with talentless individuals, people who would kill for the chance to have the skills necessary to work for Facebook, but their brains just aren't good enough<p>If you're over 30, please stop posting your ""opinion"" on Facebook. Your opinion on Facebook is about as insightful as an 80-yr-old's opinion about the internet.

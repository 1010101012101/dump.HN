They encourage farming in places not conducive to farming, leading to significant environmental degradation. Considering the strength of the agricultural lobby however such subsidies are unlikely to be repealed.",1434174821
9710053,comment,9707874,9707874,0,0,liamcardenas,,,"There comes a point in a developer&#x27;s career where the framework/language doesn&#x27;t really matter. Node, PHP, Rails, Django, etc all have their strengths and weaknesses.<p>If you are wondering which framework/language to use for a given project, the above questions won&#x27;t really help you. Instead consider the following:<p>1. How much community support does the framework have?
For example, a novice NodeJS developer is probably better off using Express than, say, Koa-- which is much less widely used and documented (unless that developer likes struggling through problems). Tackling less supported frameworks can be very educational but is also risky. If you are building a startup based on something that is unstable and/or unsupported, you may accumulate some serious technical debt that could hurt you later.<p>2. Try out all your options and decide: which one&#x27;s easier/more fun (for you)?
If you are trying to build a product, why bog yourself down with a framework that you find more difficult to use, just because some other developers say that it is &quot;not as good&quot;? Many people love ruby and python-- I&#x27;m personally not a fan of either. Does that make rails, django, or flask bad frameworks? Not at all! I just personally don&#x27;t like them. At the end of the day, you are trying to make software that /does something/. I highly recommend simply picking the easiest/&quot;funnest&quot; route. You might even consider using parse to skip backend development altogether (it just makes you more efficient as a developer).<p>3. Are you collaborating with others?
If you don&#x27;t have a strong opinion on which framework to use, why not let those who do pick their favorite for you?<p>4. Are there any special libraries/tools that you would like to use?
Not all ecosystems are created equal. Most languages have frameworks that allow you to easily make HTTP endpoints and packages to help you access databases-- which is all you need for a basic web application. However, sometimes languages will have niche libraries that make them especially ideal for a given use-case. NodeJS and Ruby have very rich ecosystems, however, there have been times where I have been forced to use python or java for this very reason. It depends completely on what you are building.<p>I typically advise people who are just beginning to learn NodeJS, so that, as a web developer, they get more comfortable with JavaScript (I see you already use express, so this may not apply to you). If you are just asking this question for the thrill of trying a new framework, and not from the perspective of using it to build anything in particular, why not try Rust Iron? I&#x27;ve been meaning to check that out, although I&#x27;m not sure if it is production ready yet.",1434174803

I repeat for a <i>third time</i>, do you have a resource with a list of patents relevant to ECC and showing that none of them apply to any current implementations (esp BSD licensed)? It might surprise you but your word doesn&#x27;t mean jack in a patent case: it&#x27;s the patents, lawyers, and judges that settle it. So, I&#x27;m only going to back down on ECC patent risk if we get a definitive statement across these patent portfolios that there&#x27;s zero risk on one or more implementations. What you all have given me so far is (a) there&#x27;s no patents on ECC whatsoever, a lie or idiocy; (b) some non-lawyer said certain ones don&#x27;t apply so magically they all don&#x27;t in a real court; (c) you personally believe nothing applies so they won&#x27;t in a court; (d) there&#x27;s software licenses going on so patents don&#x27;t apply in a real court despite NSA et al licensing patents. It all sounds really weak. People have lost suits and their profits for less.<p>I&#x27;m still awaiting your reference with evidence that each of the ECC patents don&#x27;t apply to OSS or commercial implementations. Additionally, since it was added, I&#x27;d like your side to cite evidence that everyone is licensing software implementations instead of patents that don&#x27;t apply to anything. That contradicts what I linked to so burden of proof is on you to show there&#x27;s no patent-related licensing but software instead.",1434174511

9710038,comment,9704986,9704986,0,0,mapt,,,"(numbers not precise at all)<p>I see that graph of rainfall, jumping between ~350mm in droughts and ~700mm in wet years;  From what I hear, the farming industry has allocated perhaps 3000mm of water rights, is presently consuming maybe 600mm (depleting aquifers) down from their usual 700-800mm, and is complaining about reservoirs running dry and water deliveries not showing up.  Water rights that the owner does not attempt to use in a given year are lost forever: It&#x27;s not &quot;Finder-Keeper&quot;, it&#x27;s even worse than that, overconsumption is being guaranteed by this system.<p>If California wants to be sustainable - and not that word has a specific meaning, &#x27;to be able to continue indefinitely&#x27;, rather than a vague greenness - it needs to reduce the number it actually uses to perhaps 200mm-300mm.  Because reservoirs have run low, aquifers have been mined dry, saltwater intrusion and subsidence has been happening, and the geomorphology has been all out of whack.  The invisible damage they&#x27;re doing to the natural resources they rely on using just 100% of rainfall is enormous;  They&#x27;ve killed most of the native ecosystem, most of the native rivers entirely, and turned the hills to fire tinder;  The un-farmed areas rapidly went from grassland and swamp to desert.  At 175% of rainfall things begin to happen like destroying the topography (&quot;Congratulations, your farm is now on a hill.  Water doesn&#x27;t flow uphill.&quot;) which have overt, direct externalities, things visited on one&#x27;s neighbor rather than on one&#x27;s great-grandchildren.  That&#x27;s insane.  One wouldn&#x27;t expect even a rugged individualist frontiersman to tolerate their neighbor jacking up their property a few millimeters a day in the dead of night in order to rob them of canal usage;  Shotguns would be employed in remedy.  Aquifers have an interesting property in that they&#x27;re not necessarily trivially refillable - pore spaces compress and become less permeable.  If you let the Everglades loose again, eliminating humans from Florida, it would look drastically different than it looked in pre-Columbian times because the land has sunk and water would now flow over it rather than through it.<p>So:  What will cut back agricultural water usage (<i>usage</i>, not deliveries from canals) by around 2/3 in a durable way, which minimizes the hit to GDP?  That&#x27;s what California should be asking itself.  Anything which accomplishes this goal is acceptable from a sustainability & environmental standpoint, be it bureaucratic micromanagement, pricing, blanket moratoriums, state seizure, <i>whatever</i>.",1434174118

Free parking won't do that, and a no parking zone certainly won't.<p>In Cambridge, for the same reason, you'll be ticketed if they catch you feeding the meter instead of moving your car. It doesn't matter that you're putting up more money.",1189540672

It will take some doing to convince an arbiter or, God forbid, a federal judge, that giving clear text copies of internal corporate communications to a third party is consistent with those obligations.  Especially since the EULAs of these services typically oblige an enterprise to use the ""...It's OK...they promise not to read it"" defense.<p>Even better, an employee of one of these services, quite innocently, sells some of a client corporation's stock.  That corporation better hope to whatever they consider Holy that the stock refrains from dropping for a while.  SOX makes it a good deal easier to prosecute lots of different parties to the appearance of impropriety.  Guilt and innocence goes out the window.  What matters is what is LEGAL, and a little something called ""burden of proof"".  In my own opinion, it is so low now that a sick kindergarten age child could hurdle it.<p>Unless you are a VERY good lawyer, or you can afford one, or preferably 10, I would advise you to stay away from any SOX entanglements.  Sell the enterprise some software to run on their own servers, DO NOT offer to manage it if you are a startup.<p>That said, if you can afford the battalion of attorneys, move forward with your plans.  Keep in mind however, indemnity clauses in the new SOX era means you go to prison WITH them should anything go horribly awry.",1189540369

53480,comment,52823,52823,0,0,gscott,,,"Three possible solutions to this quandry:<p>a) Annoy your co-founder like a nagging girlfriend and he will break up with you instead of you breaking up with him.  Everytime he uploads a new file or makes  a change, complain about it.  Ask him to work longer hours or pay you through equity to work longer hours.  Find new ways to nag him to no end.  Pretty soon he will find you terrible and give up, giving you the project and you will never have to worry again.<p>If solution ""A"" doesn't solve the problem move to solution B.<p>b) Cut and run, now. When you become a multi-millionaire he may go after you.  Even if he does, well you are a multi-millionaire and have the money to fight (aka FaceBook).<p>If solution ""B"" doesn't solve the problem move to solution C.<p>c) Program naked, demand that your co-founder be there so you can collaborate closer to come up with the best product. Tell him you won't program unless if he is there. <p>---<p>I believe you have a self-confidence problem, it is very important to be confident in yourself.  If your partner is not pulling his weight and you are not far enough into the project to determine if it is worth a red hot cent then it is a great time to split.  <p>Then give him everything you have done and set it up for him on another server.  You program on your copy, he programs on his copy, if he ever bothers.  I am sure he won't so that means that you will never owe him anything.<p>",1189538115

53478,comment,53049,53049,0,0,tmoertel,,,"You're creating a web site and want to lower the entry barrier for people signing up.  So you require nothing more than a valid email address to register.  So far, so good.  But now some of your users have forgotten their login passwords.  Now what?  How do you reconnect them to their accounts?<p>One option is to send account-recovery tokens to their email addresses.  (That is the method described in the post that you linked to.)  It's a reasonable method because a valid email address was all it took for your users to register in the first place.  The account-recovery emails amount to asking the recipients re-perform the original registration test: do they own the email addresses they claim to own?  If the accounts are worth the same now as when the users signed up (i.e., virtually nothing), that test is probably all you need.<p>If, however, users can accumulate real value on your site, even if the value is small, attackers will have incentive to hijack accounts. So the test for reclaiming an account must be less susceptible to attack than the do-you-own-this-email-address test, which is fairly weak.<p>Unfortunately, that's where your options start to become expensive in terms of usability.  Most users are familiar with entering passwords, receiving emails, and clicking on links, but beyond that is probably asking too much of casual web surfers.  You can't ask them to sign challenge messages with their private keys and expect them to know what you're talking about.<p>Hence the popularity of security questions.  Users are familiar with filling out forms and answering questions, so it's a plausible option for account recovery.  But, as I'm sure you are aware, it has problems. It's not very secure because the answers to many security questions are limited and therefore can be guessed.  Further, many people are reluctant to provide the answers in the first place because the ""good"" questions are invasive.  People are rightfully suspicious when you ask for their mothers' maiden names.  So if your site uses security questions, you raise the barrier for initial registration, and you'll lose some users right there.<p>So what other options do you have?  If your accounts are somehow tied to the physical world, say to bank accounts or credit cards, you can piggyback off of real-world authentication.  But that's probably not an option for most Web 2.0 sites.<p>If none of those options work for you, consider not offering account recovery at all.  When users sign up, make it very clear (several times) that if they lose their passwords, they are effectively locked out.  Tell them to write down their passwords and store them in a safe location.  For certain kinds of sites, it's a reasonable option.<p>There are other options, too, each imposing a different set of burdens on your users and offering different degrees of reliability in exchange.  Ultimately, which is best for you depends on your goals, your users, and your aversion to risk.  There is no one-size-fits all approach for sites requiring more than trivial security.<p>(If all you need is trivial security, however, there is a minimal entry level for all such sites: salt and hash each and every password using a hash function designed for password hashing, and use recovery tokens for account recovery.  Less-secure options are not any easier, for you or your users, so there's no justification for them.)<p>Cheers. --Tom\n",1189538008

53472,comment,53326,53326,0,0,bharath,,,"Another trend in memory technology that I have not seen the mainstream media talk about is the ""memory-bandwidth gap."" Memory technology has kept pace with Moore's law (in the case of SRAM) or has failed to do so (in the case of DRAM) whereas fiberoptic technology has outpaced Moore's law. The result has been routers (which need lots of memory to buffer packets) that are slower than the pipes that feed into them. So far, these observations have been restricted to the networking research crowd. It would be interesting to see a blog/mainstream media article that talks about the commercial impact of this trend in the face of the Youtube fueled streaming media explosion.",1189537506

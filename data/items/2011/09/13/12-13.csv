2991192,comment,2987883,2988238,1,0,hga,,,"This is one of my biggest beefs with MIT's new undergraduate curriculum: in the panic over the post dot.com crash in enrollment (from 400 students per class for decades to a bit less than 200) among other things orders came down from on high to purge Scheme from it.  So now it's Python and Java, and as you might know Mr. Python hates functional programing.<p>(My biggest beef is personal, in that I'm by nature a scientist and what was most interesting in the department has been officially purged, although a cut down version of 6.001 (SICP) is still being taught in January, and you can even earn credit if you're one of the first N to sign up (purely a resource constraint there).)<p>(Also BTW, enrollment has climbed back up, 305 sophomores are declared EECS majors this fall term.)<p>Problem is, the multi-core future is very much here today and as far as I know functional programming remains the best practical way to address SMP/cNUMA systems (well, you can always go to actors but then you end up copying a lot of data if you're not functional and in general they haven't caught on like their proponents had hoped, except that of course that style is used for less tightly coupled multi-processor systems like today's big supercomputers).",1315918628

2991188,comment,2990571,2990571,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"If a presentation can be fit into three slides, then why use slides at all? At that point, it seems better suited to a one-page Word doc. To wit: one of the most effective short-form idea communication tools I've ever seen is the infamous ""P&G Memo"" used by Procter & Gamble. It's worth Googling, absorbing, and pressing into service. You'd be amazed at how pretty much any complex idea can be condensed into a single page -- not to mention how much more readily it will be received and digested, which is the entire point of communication.<p>As for Powerpoint and Keynote, reserve those for actual presentations (i.e., delivered live in front of an audience). Try to avoid them as handouts or passed-around documents, unless requested by the recipient (And even then, politely push back if possible; most people have been conditioned to ask for PPTs when they don't really need, or even want them).",1315918593

The ScanSnaps, while being quite a bit more expensive and bigger do have a decent support.<p>If we're only talking about the odd invoice, any normal scanner would do, too. If you get one of those printer/scanner combinations, you'll also save some space.<p>Yes, the app situation for Linux isn't that good. The Evernote web app alone isn't as comfortable as a native application, and I haven't seen anything decent out of the open source sector.<p>I'd recommend going a bit more low-tech. Create a script that invokes the ""scanimage"" command with the desired parameters, then moves it to your ""cloud"" directory (Dropbox, Ubuntu One etc.). There, run OCR software over it, dumping the result in a file. If nothing major has changed, tesseract would be the free OCR software of choice.<p>For simplicity's sake, I'd recommend that the script automatically chooses the file name, you just add some ""tags"", e.g. if your script is called ""scan_stuff"", you'd invoke it as ""scan_stuff amazon invoice"", and the result would end up as ""~/Dropbox/scans/2011-09-13-14-46-amazon-invoice.pdf"", alongside a ""2011-09-13-14-46-amazon-invoice.txt"" file generated from that. This makes it easy enough to search by date or by a rather generic type.<p>The SANE scanimage command supports batch mode, even if you don't have an automatic feeder (--batch-prompt).<p>This might not be as automatic as some of the specialized solutions for Windows or Mac, but it does handle special cases a bit better. You can just have a parameter or separate script for that and don't have to mess with Preferences each time something slightly different comes in (e.g. color, higher dpi, different target directory).",1315918281

In this one, about presentations, he fails to understand that <i>how</i> you present is not to be separated from <i>what</i> you present.  I too have heard lectures where somebody reads from notes.  They are often awful.<p>Without writing my own tome (which would obviously be flawed), I'll simply implore you to consider the following question when putting your presentation together:  Are you trying to teach or to persuade?<p>If persuading, keeping it entirely verbal may be effective (if you are good at such things).  However, if teaching, most evidence points to opening up as many sensory channels as possible to get the information across.  Usually, that means verbal and visual.<p>The most important thing is to structure your talk so that the audience's mind is engaged.  A simple trick to help is to ask questions (even if rhetorically), then reveal the answer.<p>In other words, it's <i>how</i> you use the slides, not <i>whether</i> you use the slides.<p>Same with pie charts, btw (the other offending article).<p>EDIT:  emphasis",1315918101

It means the bakery can not afford to buy a food future anymore (because banks drove the prices for futures up too much). So they'll have to do without the futures and simply buy at market rate once they need the wheat.<p>The allegation is that banks would never actually buy the food they have the futures for (they don't have silos for storing the food).<p>So the most damage they can do is destroy the utility of food futures.

The average big-company CEO works 58 hours per week. That's not slacking, but with the magical ability to buy one's way out of most out-of-office responsibilities, it's not that impressive either. It's what average people work, all included. CEOs just have the luxury of being more focused.<p>People don't <i>actually</i> vary that much in how much they can work. You're better off learning how to ""work smart"" than trying to work more hours. Most ""hard working"" people are just more focused, not more sacrificial.<p>To be cynical: the ""power career"" people are just another mechanism through which an elite class sustains an illusion of superiority. People whose bitchy daily needs are taken care of can work 1.5 times harder and learn 1.5 times faster and, because of nonlinearity and network effects, they get 10 times the results. It performs the same function as being a 6-foot-tall nobleman in 800 AD, when the average peasant was under 5 feet due to malnutrition. People of height now considered average were ""obviously"" physically superior and deserved their status of lordship.<p>Ten or fifteen years from now, I'll probably be running my own company. And I'll be leaving at 5:00 pm every day and ""stealth"" working from home. I don't want people with less income trying to compete against me on hours. That's stupid.

2991106,comment,2990592,2991085,1,0,Tichy,,,"To be honest, I still don't understand how speculation is supposed to drive the food prizes up. At the very least, food seems very ill suited for that kind of speculation, because it deteriorates. So if your gamble doesn't play out within a year or so, you make a loss of 100%.<p>Seriously, how does it work? So you buy a certificate for 100$, giving you the right to pay a ton of wheat for 1000$. Then you buy a ton of wheat for 1000$. Then what? If nobody buys wheat for you for 2000$, you lose. Rather than throwing the wheat away, you might end up selling it for 500$. Simply by buying a future that entitles you to buy wheat for 1000$/ton doesn't change the price of wheat. In the same sense it doesn't change the price of Google stock if I decide to buy a future that entitles me to buy Google stock for 10000$/unit.<p>It might be a problem for the baker who wants to plan ahead and would rather like to have a guarantee that he'll get the wheat for 500$. But if the real price is actually headed for 2000$, he would not have gotten that 500$ certificate anyway. Also if he had gotten it, he would effectively have ripped off the peasants.<p>Also, somebody has to buy the food at those high prizes. And if prizes stay high, it would be good for peasants and they should increase production. For example it might become more profitable to plant real food instead of raw materials for ethanol.",1315917158

2991099,comment,2989677,2990908,4,0,krschultz,,,"You are ignoring resale value. I'll walk you through my math using 15,000 miles a year on my Subaru Forester.<p>I bought my 2004 Forester XS with 70,000 miles on it for $9300 (KBB very good or excellent condition at purchase, but that was actual price paid to seller on Craigslist). I have exactly 100,000 on it right now. In between I've done about $1000 in non-scheduled maitenance & repairs (new A/C compressor, and an O2 sensor) that are related to the age of the car. I will ignore about $1000 in regular maitenance (oil changes, automatic transmission changes, new set of tires, new belts).<p>Based on the current value on Craigslist, I can get easily $7500 for it. So I will have lost $1800 on the price of the car and $1000 on repairs over 2 years. That's only $1500 a year or $116 a month which is not bad.<p>But over the next 45,000 miles, the car repairs are going to pick up. Timing belt change and a new exhaust are both looming which is around $1500. Plus what do you get for a car with 150,000 miles on it, $3000? $4000? So lets say over the next 3 years I will spend $2k on maitenance and the price will drop from the current $7500 to $4k. 3.5k in depreciation and $2k in maitenance is $5.5k over 3 years and around $152 a month. Obviously the car is getting more costly, and that is assuming I can get $4000 for the car with 145,000 miles on it which is asking a lot. More likely it will cost more like $180 a month.<p>So now we're talking about $180 a month for a car with somewhere between 100,000 and 145,000 miles on it. I used to pay $206 a month for a brand new Mazda 6 on lease that I put $500 down on. As a skier I like the Subaru but you'd be hard pressed to convince me a car with 20,000 miles on it is not worth $40 more a month than a car with 120,000 miles on it.<p>For comparison the original owner had to do basically no repairs and got 70,000 miles for a depreciation from $24,000 to $9300. So he lost around $267 a month. He may have even been better off leasing 2 cars during that time period.<p>Take your car, pull up the kelly blue book, and graph it out by year in Excel. Everyone knows that depreciation is not linear and that the 1st year is a killer, but a lot of people don't realize there are several plateaus in the price. If you buy and and sell the car on either end of a plateau you will lose very little. I holding a bit too long on this car, I should have sold it 5k miles ago or right now, but I really want it for the winter for skiing and I want to sell it in the spring and have no car at all next summer which is of course the cheapest option of all.<p>*Note I did the math owning the car start to finish, that would be $24,000 for the car and probably $4k for repairs over the life of the car (lets say 175,000 miles). That's 12 years with the same car and it costs roughly $200 a month. Personally after 12 years I would be quite bored with a car, but you can see it's not always the absolute cheapest option. I personally prefer to keep buying good quality/condition used cars coming off lease or the first owner and hold them for 2-3 years and then sell them.",1315916958

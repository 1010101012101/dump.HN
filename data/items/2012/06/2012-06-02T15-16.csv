If you replace an assert with a conditional that allows the execution to continue, you are concealing the problem and making it that much harder to track.<p>Practically speaking, <i>your</i> function should not be failing because <i>your</i> other code passed it invalid parameters.

4058337,comment,4058140,4058140,2,0,mkmcdonald,,,"As a developer, I'll outline why I <i>rationally</i> have great contempt for advertising.<p>Television, print and radio advertisements have irrevocably caused me to gag at most advertisements. I can see right though the lies and half-truths that marketers spin to fool people into buying their mediocre products. Take any McDonald's ad campaign over the past few years. Note that (at least in Canada) that no overweight person is ever featured. Somehow, perfectly healthy people are devouring Big Macs and we're expected to believe it.<p>Advertisements now often rely heavily on sexual overtones. Web advertisements are quite guilty as well. As an adult male with a functioning brain, I find ads that rely on sexuality disgusting. I wasn't compelled to purchase alcohol before the commercial came on, and now I'm thoroughly repulsed. Decrement another point of respect for marketers.<p>I'm also disturbed by ad companies tracking me whenever possible. I read a forum thread on a public computer which described a custom suit company. For the next week, I was inundated with ads for that company on the same computer. I do not seek ""personalization"" as I never intentionally click on ads. If I want something, I'll go out and look for it. On my own computer, I block as many ad servers as I can through my hosts file.<p>Yes, the world really does revolve around money. However, advertising is not the sole plausible revenue model for a web site. Wikipedia is a fine example of a web site that doesn't need third-party advertising to exist. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the Wikimedia Foundation because it's funded so openly. GitHub seems to be chugging along without bombarding its users with advertisements because it has a premium content model.<p>As was mentioned earlier, ""engineers"" are smart enough to see through advertising. Disillusionment of web sites like Facebook and Google Analytics is more than enough to propagate disgust for advertising.",1338652615

It (v3, at least) actually strongly embraced being a Javascript API in a time when most APIs were not. Almost all objects are created with options specified almost exactly the same way as here. The main thing this seems to add is being able to specify event handlers in the same way (that really does appear to be the majority of the code).<p>It does look lighter to use, but that's just the age-old difficulty of writing an API that's both lightweight when it needs to be and completely flexible when it needs to be. You'll run into the same problem with this library, but in the other direction, if you need more than one click handler on something, or you need to use the underlying MVC structure directly, etc.<p>edit: it's a minor thing, but not having to create a LatLng object every time you need one <i>is</i> nice on the code verbosity scale. That's one of the first things I alias when making a project with the maps api, actually. Lots of ""new""s in your code isn't unidiomatic Javascript, though, even if some wish it were :)",1338651333

We know very clear that their politics isn't about human rights but re-islamization.<p>Second, they run a pretty Nazi-like agenda: pure Turkish blood ideology (when it comes to marriages), supporting demographic pressure, strict top-down government, militarization, ideological intolerance, brutal assimilation of Kurds and other minorities, one can even count their recent anti-Israel doctrine and their attempts to establish themselves as the protector of Muslim interests and their volkisch politics to protect the Turkish immigrants in Western Europe (where they clearly influence politicians of Turkish origin and use their network of mosques and religious institutions to steer ""their"" population). It's a neo-Osmanic power game similar to what the Nazis did in the 1930s.",1338649615

If anyone owns it, they do. Of course, it was a derivative product of <i>their</i> genetic code, which they really had no claim to in the first place.<p>2) I leave complete copies of my DNA lying around everywhere I go, and on everything I touch. Maybe not in quantities that can be sequenced, yet, but it's there. Granted that I have ownership (and then some) over my own body, does that really continue to apply to the bits I discard in your foyer without noticing or caring?<p>I understand there are political issues that transcend this, but it feels like a case where politics is fighting a losing battle against physics.",1338649473

It was easier then since there was much less competition, so I think you'd have to pick your niche pretty carefully now.<p>My business (actually just me) made a small name for itself on the Mac scene (again, easier then than now) and pretty quickly hit around $50K/yr in revenue. It stayed around that level for many years, sometimes peaking at $7K/month after a significant release.<p>I haven't released any significant updates for years, yet it still brings around $30K/yr. This is in exchange for a couple of hours of sales and support per month. That's what great about shareware - just like a well-designed web business, once you've written the code, it can become a tidy passive income stream. And I've no doubt I could have made more of it by marketing it better, but I never quite had the inclination.<p>Two concrete bits of advice:<p>1. My two best and longest-selling products are tools for small (and occasionally large) businesses to get things done easier and quicker.<p>2. Work the feedback loop. My top selling product ended up being used in a way I never predicted. I heard about this from my customers and over time made it highly specialized for that purpose.<p>When it comes to acquiring wealth, did shareware make a millionaire? No - more like 1/3 of the way there, after tax.<p>But shareware did give me the income and freedom to not have to seek a job when I graduated, and in turn that let me pursue further study, and in parallel develop other (web-based) ideas which turned out to be the real earners.",1223157518

Just like the world needs people who focus on the happiness of themselves and those close to them, it also needs those who look at problems that affect all of us and say '.. and this is what I am going to do about it'<p>Pick your favorite world changer, do you really think they would have been motivated for change if they did not constantly ask themselves 'what am I going to do about this huge problem?'",1223157406

323676,comment,323656,323656,0,0,wheels,,,"Always listen to your users.  Don't always do what they ask.<p>When I took a course on software usability many years ago the first principle was how to work from what a user asked for to what they wanted to do.  So, a user might say, ""Can I have a checkbox to turn off feature Y?""  What that meant was, ""The way feature Y is implemented annoys me.""  And the solution is often to rethink feature Y and what it's supposed to do.",1223156667
323675,comment,323482,323637,0,0,robg,,,"But it's not quite that dependent either. There are stages of dependencies. Some states hang together more tightly (Northeast, West Coast, and Deep South) than others (Midwest and Southeast). And gradual shifts can be detected through polling and pinned to real world events (conventions, crises, etc). The campaigns use game theory to move resources accordingly (see McCain now in Minnesota versus pulling out of Michigan). Obama has a very strong firewall.<p>That's where, I guess, 538.com has taught me so much. The polls are a constant flow of changing opinions. But if your models are sensitive and well-designed you can see the slow wave shifts developing. It's not predictive, but history helps too. For instance, no candidate has ever been this far up, with this little time left, and lost.",1223156570
323674,comment,323482,323564,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'm curious how he modeled it. Do actual results follow a bell curve with prior polling as the median and some well-known standard deviation? If so, it would explain why a 10% lead in the polls is considered nearly insurmountable in a given state. I know that if someone is polling at 60-40 in terms of voters, their odds of winning the state are much higher. I've heard 90% thrown out, but don't have any hard data.<p>Perhaps a better Monte Carlo would use polling data and that.",1223156509

323672,comment,323482,323482,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"This is interesting because it points out yet another opportunity. If you believe 538, you should pretty much be buying Obama to win on Intrade and shorting him on the swing states.<p>It would hurt my brain too much to do so, but you could probably figure out a betting strategy with a small or moderate assured return.",1223156306
323671,comment,323482,323637,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"No. It means he's ahead in so many states, that he'd pretty much have to do something big (and it's going to take more than a little faux pas) to fuck it up, and there's about a 10% chance of that.",1223156156

Why does an e-book reader need a keyboard and other nonsense taking up roughly half of the real estate that could be used for adding more screen? This seems like the perfect application for a touch-screen since the majority of time should be spent reading or interacting with existing documents, something that isn't terribly difficult to do with limited navigation.<p>To me it just looks childish because there's so much bezel and cruft and no screen.",1223155971

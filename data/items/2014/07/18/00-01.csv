Unless you&#x27;re putting them right next to barren land, they&#x27;re all pretty similar.<p>Keep in mind also that chess is an extremely abstract version of combat, whereas Civ is trying to emulate civilisations. Likewise, chess has six different kinds of pieces, all of which play very differently. Civ effectively has three: &#x27;ranged unit&#x27;, &#x27;melee unit&#x27;, and &#x27;air unit&#x27;, without much difference between ranged and melee. There simply isn&#x27;t the scope for clever arrangement or movement of pieces like in chess - civ combat is more simplistic like checkers... a game which very few people enthuse about.",1405645005

8051138,comment,8050320,8050880,1,0,michaelrash,,,"First, let me state that I have a lot of respect for Moxie.  That out of the way, knockknock is not above criticism too:<p>1) It is possible to mount a MITM attack against knockknock just by intercepting a knockknock packet, changing the source IP, and retransmitting. This is a consequence of knockknock not encrypting the source IP within any payload (which involve only packet headers in the knockknock implementation). fwknop does not suffer from this problem because it encrypts the IP to be allowed within the SPA payload.\n2) You mention time synchronization issues above.  Well, knockknock uses AES in CTR mode, and this also requires synchronization between the client and server of a different kind.  If synchronization were a problem for fwknop, then you must apply this critique to knockknock too.\nYou _can_ disable time sync in fwknop if you really want to, but it was added to prevent MITM attacks.<p>Here are the design goals that fwknop is developed around:<p><a href=""http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/fwknop-tutorial.html#design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cipherdyne.org/fwknop/docs/fwknop-tutorial.html#d...</a>",1405644904

After choosing a career that was well-known for death-marches, that&#x27;s the closest analogy I can offer (this crowd).  Unlike a death-march, you never grow to hate the process: sometimes you grit your teeth just to take that next step, but your heart demands you continue.<p>After reading your story, I realize I walked a much easier path - my son was born with trisomy-21 (Down Syndrome) and it was easily diagnosed (though not so easily accepted by us parents).  It turned out he had several more genetic disorders, but as each was identified, it was (more easily) dealt with.<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine going through his first five years gathering questions but receiving no answers.  We have two children older than our disabled son, and when people asked me what I wanted them to be when they grew up, I was always quick to answer &quot;happy&quot;.  You&#x27;ve given so much (both for Betrand and the others you&#x27;ve gathered together) that I don&#x27;t want to take anything away from your amazing journey.  I do want to give you what I can here - a simple blessing.  May God bless you and your family so that you always find strength in him and in each other, and may your eyes be quick to see those small joys and victories so many people miss in their hectic lives.<p>Thanks so much for sharing both the original story and the follow-up!<p>EDIT:<p>There&#x27;s so much to say!  I&#x27;ll keep it brief though.<p>I should have noted that growing up in a household with a disabled child has had a profound impact on my other three children.  My older two are adults now (and Sam just turned 18) but from a young age they had empathy and sympathy that far exceeded what most adults feel.  It&#x27;s actually shaped their character in a tremendously good way.<p>[1] Exceptional Lives - <a href=""http://www.blurb.com/b/651459-exceptional-lives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blurb.com/b/651459-exceptional-lives</a><p>[2] Your Special Chef (Cookbook) - <a href=""http://www.blurb.com/search/site_search?search=your+special+chef"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blurb.com/search/site_search?search=your+special+...</a><p>[3] Your Special Chef (Website) - <a href=""http://www.yourspecialchef.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yourspecialchef.com</a><p>[4] My favorite molecular geneticist - <a href=""http://annamoyer.com/assets/resumesum2013_moyer.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://annamoyer.com/assets/resumesum2013_moyer.jpg</a>",1405644690

Even now, a generic Dell keyboard has me thinking QWERTY, while it&#x27;d be impossible for me to type on my Das Keyboard Ultimate in QWERTY. Actually what&#x27;s since messed up my QWERTY the most has been the unusual grid pattern of the Kinesis Advantage. I love it, but it&#x27;s given me some bad habits at more traditional keyboards.

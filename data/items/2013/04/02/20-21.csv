I work a lot on viral growth and I'd like to add a counterpoint that the growth of apps is so complicated that it is basically impossible to model in a useful way.<p>I've found that even if I make no changes to an app, the retention and virals fluctuate quite a bit for no apparent reason, and the fluctuations are big enough that it makes long term forecasting really more of guesswork than anything else.<p>Also, there are second order effects that are hard to model as well. For instance, improving virals can improve retention (user A invites friend B, user A stays for longer because their friend uses it).<p>I've gone through the process of modeling a couple apps, and it quickly gets to a point where the relationships become circular and small variations cause exponential differences down the line.<p>It is important to make informed decisions about virals and retention, but I don't think such a model is the way to do it. I think it is more important to think about optionality and decision making in opaque environments rather than trying to model the unmodelable.",1364936393

In fact, it may be the <i>only</i> article I've ever read that used that term, that wasn't a complete joke.<p>There's so much truth there... we work on ""stuff"" and some of the ""stuff"" we work on is truly amazing in many ways, but - and I don't know about you - I sometimes find myself wondering ""is this <i>really</i> making the world a better place, in the general sense""?  Even the stuff we are doing at Fogbeam Labs, which I am very passionate about, and even though we have very explicit core values[1] that drive us - sometimes leaves me thinking ""this isn't going to help a poor starving child in Africa.  Should I be doing something else""?<p>On the other hand, part of the reason we do all Open Source software is exactly because we think producing more OSS <i>does</i> make the world generally better, in at least some small regard.  And if some would be entrepreneur in Africa or Afghanistan or something uses our software some day, and it helps them succeed, grow a business and create jobs and improve lives, then we <i>have</i> done something very positive.  But it's hard to keep that in mind sometimes, when the chain of connections is so long and so speculative.

That's a voluntary response survey, which means that it almost surely doesn't represent the general population. (By the way, my first answer to a question like that would be ""Huawei,"" but then I could think of plenty more, including brands that are only sold in China, which I have visited.)<p>Here's a FAQ about the junk data from voluntary response surveys: As I commented previously when we had a poll on the ages of HNers, the data can't be relied on to make such an inference. That's because the data are not from a random sample of the relevant population. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>-----Original Message----- From: Paul Velleman [SMTPfv2@cornell.edu] Sent: Wednesday, January 14, 1998 5:10 PM To: apstat-l@etc.bc.ca; Kim Robinson Cc: mmbalach@mtu.edu Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>For more on the distinction between statistics and mathematics, see ""Advice to Mathematics Teachers on Evaluating Introductory Statistics Textbooks""<p><a href=""http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statland.org/MyPapers/MAAFIXED.PDF</a><p>and ""The Introductory Statistics Course: A Ptolemaic Curriculum?""<p><a href=""http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://escholarship.org/uc/item/6hb3k0nz</a><p>I think Professor Velleman promotes ""Voluntary response data are worthless"" as a slogan for the same reason an earlier generation of statisticians taught their students the slogan ""correlation does not imply causation."" That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has to take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world. The Literary Digest poll<p><a href=""http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5168/</a><p><a href=""http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/LiteraryDigest.pdf</a><p>is a spectacular historical example of a voluntary response poll with a HUGE sample size and high response rate that didn't give a correct picture of reality at all.<p>When I have brought up this issue before, some other HNers have replied that there are some statistical tools for correcting for response-bias effects, IF one can obtain a simple random sample of the population of interest and evaluate what kinds of people respond. But we can't do that here on HN.<p>Another reply I frequently see when I bring up this issue is that the public relies on voluntary response data all the time to make conclusions about reality. To that I refer careful readers to what Professor Velleman is quoted as saying above (the general public often believes statements that are baloney) and to what Google's director of research, Peter Norvig, says about research conducted with better data,<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that even good data (and Norvig would not generally characterize voluntary response data as good data) can lead to wrong conclusions if there isn't careful thinking behind a study design. Again, human beings have strong predilections to believe certain kinds of wrong data and wrong conclusions. We are not neutral evaluators of data and conclusions, but have predispositions (cognitive illusions) that lead to making mistakes without careful training and thought.<p>Another frequently seen reply is that sometimes a ""convenience sample"" (this is a common term among statisticians for a sample that can't be counted on to be a random sample) of a population offers just that, convenience, and should not be rejected on that basis alone. But the most thoughtful version of that frequent reply I have previously seen in online discussion did correctly point out that if we know from the get-go that the sample was not done statistically correctly, then even if we are confident (enough) that HN participants are young, we wouldn't want to extrapolate from that to conclude that the users of any technology site are young, or that users of the Internet as a whole are young.<p>On my part, I wildly guess that most HNers are younger than I am in part because this kind of poll recurs often on HN. Other preoccupations of younger rather than older people make up frequent topics on HN, and I've tried looking for signs that there are large hidden numbers of old participants here without finding many.",1364936096

The opportunity to do hard work that can be seen as purely technological innovation is often more appealing than retrofitting some technology to solve an existing problem.<p>To use the example you gave, _forms_ of online payment exist, and are growing. Products like Paypal have been changing the way many companies think about accepting payment from their customers for years; immediate online payment has slowly been adopted by the U.S's largest banks.<p>However, for most of their users, these technologies exist as innovations in luxury: they improve upon existing technologies in order to provide further ease-of-use. This is different, I think, than applying an existing technology to a problem: instead of _improving_ upon something, you are instead _applying_ something to a different set of circumstances.<p>I think many people do not think of that as a hard problem: since the 'hard' technology already exists, applying it should be easy.<p>I also think that for most ambitious people who have 'innovate' stamped at the top of their to-do list and have the freedom of choosing what they would like to work on, it then appears to be a choice between 'improve' and 'apply', and improve likely wins out for most.<p>EDIT:\nI realize that I essentially re-make the 'iterate vs innovate' point the author makes in my above comment, but I am choosing to keep it there for the sake of coherence.",1364935501

AAVE is how people of poorer means speak or with less education speak, even if it's not politically correct to say it. Spanish is an actual language hundreds of years old and spoken by multiple nations. By your logic you might as well recognize English slang as an actual language.<p>-Edit: So for those arguing that AAVE is a dialect, then If I add a few rules to any other language does that mean I've just invented a new language. That is what AAVE is, it is just English with a few additional rules that some people of low socioeconomic mean have learned (reinforced through bad education). Hardly what I would call a new language. Maybe in 500 years if the people speaking it become isolated, right now is just bad English.<p>In spanish there are people with low socioeconomic means that will also talk a bit different. Even with their own rules for some things. You do not call that a new language to spare their feelings. You call them uneducated and rightly so or else when will they learn if they are not ever corrected?

5481890,comment,5481430,5481430,19,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for the submission. This is an interesting article about applied linguistics for primary education in the United States. Approximately around 1900, the United States reached its peak period of receiving immigrants who were not English-speaking when they arrived. Today, nearly all Americans speak one variety or another of English, even though only about one-fourth of the United States population consists of persons whose ancestors spoke English before arrival in the United States. English has been assimilated by almost all inhabitants of the United States precisely because it is the only language that unites all those inhabitants. (Three of my four grandparents, all of whom were born in the United States, spoke a language at home other than English. My two maternal grandparents received the entirety of their schooling in church-operated schools in the German language, one in Nebraska and one in Colorado. But they spoke English just fine as adults, and that was the language I communicated with them in both by direct conversation and by postal letters. My Norwegian-speaking paternal grandmother went to college, majoring in English, and relied on her knowledge of another Germanic language to help her progress in reading Beowulf in the original Old English. I still have her college edition of Beowulf at home.)<p>The worry in the United States today is about the primary education of young people who grow up in cohesive communities of speakers of varieties of English that differ from broadcast standard General American English. The cases of African-American speakers and Hawaiian speakers of dialectal English are both mentioned in the article. To me, as someone who studied linguistics in my university studies, it seems a ""no brainer"" to meet elementary school pupils on common ground and to make sure their teachers understand the home language background of the pupils as the pupils are taught standard English in school. (Everyone appears to be united in the cause of making sure school pupils learn the standard national language, with the only serious dispute being about means.) There are, alas, social disadvantages in the United States from having nonstandard speech patterns<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5123171"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5123171</a><p>even if those speech patterns are well accepted in some social subgroups here. Just as my grandparents were free to use German or Norwegian to communicate throughout their long lifetimes, let today's children speak however they like in their private lives, but let's meanwhile provide all learners the opportunity to learn the speech patterns that are most expedient to adopt here.",1364934627

When I started working at a factory when I was 18, I was suddenly bombarded with blue collar vernacular. By the time I was 21, double negatives, particular ""ain't got no.."" were fairly ingrained in my speech and I still talk like that in informal situations. I certainly wouldn't advocate that becoming a nationally recognized language.

In principle you could solve the 'magic' problem <i>without changing a line of code</i>, purely by changing how the mechanisms provided are packaged to new programmers.<p>I spent some time last year trying to distinguish between abstractions and services. According to me, abstractions are things that you are expected to understand the workings of, and services are things you are not.

Many programming libraries are services because <i>in practice</i> nobody bothers to learn how they work, and we as a field, as a species, tolerate this cargo culting.<p>Unfortunately I had trouble articulating this distinction.

Strange matter may obey different laws, but it still obeys laws.<p>But in an information system like a computer program, things are a lot more nebulous. You can't even in principle point to the bit that makes one instruction a buffer overflow and another not.

The problem is people are used to thinking of this as an online payments problem, instead of a ubiquitous solution -- the average region will have isolated stores with no adoption, but there are pockets where the solution works really well and has widespread usage.  Density is really important to the consumer value proposition, as are having the right demographics in your early regions.  From what I saw in Boston they got it right.  It will be interesting to see how that plays out with expansion through channel sales with Heartland.  I think LevelUp is different enough from Square that there is room in the market for both of them.  Also, Seth is a really great guy who's easy to root for.

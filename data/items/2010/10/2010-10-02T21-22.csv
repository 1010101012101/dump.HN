Imagine being able to quickly apply a relatively mechanical refactoring that still required human judgement (pretty common), and have other programmers do it for you.<p>I imagine it would work something like this:<p>- Select the files/directories/blocks of code that you want the refactoring applied to.<p>- Describe (in english) what the refactoring work should be, and do an example on one piece of the code.<p>- The work gets split (by file?) and distributed via a mechanical turk-like interface (extra points if it opens tasks in your favorite editor with syntax highlighting).  As workers submit their work, the code is automatically built and tests are run (could be a callback to your local development environment, so you don't have to worry about shipping all your code up to the cloud and figuring out how to build it there).<p>Could be pretty awesome, particularly if you could enlist an army of freshman CS majors, bored programmers, and eager overseas engineers.  I wonder if intellectual property concerns would be too high for people to actually use it though.<p>EDIT: If I still worked at Google, this would be a fun project to try internally as 20% project.  There are lots of mechanical refactoring tasks that need to be done across large portions of the codebase, good build/test infrastructure to easily verify success/failure for a given task, and lots of bored/eager engineers that feed off of reward-based systems:)",1286056772

I've been told that the released version will be faster.<p>* The keyboard is very nice. One feature that I noticed is that if you hold down the letter key, you get accented versions of that same key. Makes it much easier to type résumé instead of resume. I can't compare it in over-all usability to other smart phones as I haven't lived day in day out with a smart phone.<p>* The way applications are organized is interesting. Instead of merely having a mongo huge list of apps, apps can also register themselves in app hubs. So applications that manipulate photos will show up under your photos, applications that deal with music show up there, etc. I'm not totally sold on this, but it seems like a good idea.<p>* Development for WP7 in silverlight is shockingly easy. And silverlight on WP7 runs super fast. Actually runs faster on the device than on my beefy desktop in emulator.<p>* There isn't yet an easy way to handle deploying WP7 phones in an enterprise, but I was told that this will be addressed later. There was only so much they could do before this launch though.<p>I'm in the market for a smart phone, and after handling the WP7 phones I am sold.

Every factory that I am personally in contact with (it's a fair number across several countries) are significantly more professional in sampling, production and payments than what you describe. Sampling done at the place of production, no matter where in the world, should be measured in days.<p>There are plenty of good agents if you know the right places to look who handle a lot of the details for you. Obviously, the problem is finding the right guy. All your problems of solved issues like fit, patterns etc. are taken care of then. Something like pattern grading can be done in 5 minutes by anybody who has experience to 90% accuracy.<p>To say that a t-shirt takes a half hour to make is a bit naive. The amount of processing and handling that goes between picking cotton and packing a t-shirt is non-trivial. Even if you want to just limit yourself to the garment process, you are talking about fabric handling, cutting, sorting, stitching, checking and packing. This is a complex procedure.<p>> Unless you have a good contact at the other end, the first few runs will be horribly wrong, because people don't pay attention, particularly on new/small clients with low revenue. _This happens no matter where you have things made._<p>[emphasis mine]<p>This is not true. Again, work with a professional factory, and you should not have this problem.<p>> Finally, you get your garments shipped, and then you send them off to be dyed, screen-printed, tagged, and packaged.<p>Or...use a manufacturer who can do all of that for you. I'll admit that finding a world-class garment laundry outside of California is difficult, but I guarantee you that you can get a lot of the way there for dollars a garment cheaper if you look hard.<p>> Then you deliver them to the places you sold to, and then 3 months later they pay you.

The reason would be that there have been thousands of wasted programmer hours due to discussions initiated by someone saying ""rails can't scale"", when they obviously don't know what they're talking about, so it does come off as trollish.<p>It became a something many said because of Twitter's scaling problems, which is probably how you heard about it. But later, it became clear and commonly accepted among the community that Twitter's scaling problems did not stem from rails itself, but other parts of its infrastructure. Saying ""rails doesn't scale"" really doesn't make too much sense, because scaling the application layer is arguably the easiest part of scaling: essentially you add more app servers, and load balance between them. The hard part is scaling the database etc.<p>In Twitter, at first they had a lot of issues because the queuing software they wrote wasn't great for their workloads and was pretty slow. And there are a ton of other moving parts as well in the application and the team must have kept hitting walls in all the various parts.

For Linux, probably C/Gtk or C++/Qt.<p>The problem with cross-platform apps is that you end up programming to the least common denominator of the platforms you support, and your app never has the performance or look & feel that users expect.  Contrast: uTorrent vs. Azureus, iChat vs. Pidgin, TextMate vs. jEdit, etc.  In a hyper-competitive desktop space, that often means death.  Giant companies like IBM (Eclipse) or Mozilla (Firefox) can get away with it because the scale of what they're doing is very difficult for a small startup to replicate, but most micro-ISVs can't.<p>Yes, this is one reason why developing desktop apps sucks.",1286054751

1751394,comment,1750073,1750537,0,0,avinashv,,,"You have a lot of things here, so let me attack each thing step-by-step:<p>> This thread (and especially this post) are interesting to me because I have considered -- on and off since I was a teen -- designing/making my own clothes (to meet my special needs) and, recently, toyed with the idea of doing something like that as a business (and all but dismissed the idea out of hand as just too much trouble).<p>Don't give something you are passionate about up! Please contact me if you need help getting off your feet. I will be happy to help you with as much advice and direction that I can.<p>> Any thoughts on finding/making cotton-silk blend knits (for women)? I rarely can find this but it is awesome when I can.<p>Cotton-silk is difficult and expensive to process. In knits, you'll only find this in the high-end. Zegna does the best big-name cotton-silk knit fabric that I have seen on a garment. If there is a store around you, go to their polos and take a look.<p>Why silk? If you want a soft hand feel, look at modal. It is a stronger fiber than rayon, significantly softer than cotton, and processes about as easily. In today's cotton market, it is only marginally more expensive. A cotton/modal blend is magnificent.<p>> Silks are too expensive and too fragile for my lifestyle and rarely come in knits. They shrink horribly when washed and just don't stand up to my lifestyle (which is rooted in keeping everything clean enough to stay well in spite of my medical condition, and dry-cleaning is not acceptable as I react badly to the chemicals).<p>If you are talking about woven silk shrinking, then you are doing something horribly wrong. If you are talking about knits shrinking...well, that's difficult to explain. Shrinkage is controlled in fabric finishing by ""setting"" the fabric while holding it at the dimensional stability you are after. Most garments that are 100% cotton in the US/Europe will have between 7-9% shrinkage in both length and width. This means the dimensions will shrink by that percentage after the third wash.<p>> Most knits are cotton-polyester, not acceptable in my book.<p>100% is by far the most common yarn to knit with. Cotton and polyester have to be dyed in different processes, so to make a solid color (dyeing both cotton and polyester as opposed to just one or the other) is more expensive than starting off with cotton yarn and just single-dyeing it.<p>Incidentally, the whole ""heather is the new black"" phase in the States confuses me. Most cheap heather garments are a cotton/poly blend and suck. Look for 100% cotton heathers--they are dyed at the fibre stage (before the yarn is spun) and are significantly better garments.<p>> I don't wear polyester....etc...etc.<p>Polyester, when processed correctly, gets too little credit. It has better drape and appearance than cotton, and is orders of magnitude stronger. It obviously has different uses.<p>> So I have played with the idea a bit. I looked up a site called ""French Rags"" because I know they do mass customization and they sell knits. But it turns out they use a yarn blend I don't want (IIRC: cotton-acrylic). Good quality affordable clothes is really tough to find.<p>I don't know French Rags, but a good-quality store wouldn't use blends like that. What is affordable to you? I can make recommendations.<p>> Nylon and some spandex is also acceptable for me. But polyester is absolutely unacceptable, most other synthetics are not really very acceptable, and 100% cotton wrinkles so bad and therefore is too high maintenance.<p>Viscose/rayon, modal, bamboo etc. all count as synthetics. All of those are significantly superior to cotton in all aspects of feel, coolness and drape.<p>100% cotton doesn't wrinkle bad if you get well-processed fabric, and understand how to iron clothes properly. The key is medium-high heat and plenty of moisture in the form of steam. If all else fails, iron your clothes with only 90% of the dryer cycle. On all good steam irons there is a button that squirts water. If you've ever wondered what it is for, then this is it. If there is a hard crease, just squirt it with water and run the iron over it with steam and the crease will be gone.<p>I don't own a single ""wrinkle-free"" shirt or pair of pants. I buy good quality dress shirts and pants, and only wear 100% cotton (100% linen shirts for the summer). If you are willing to commit to 7 minutes of ironing per garment, then there is no reason that you shouldn't have crisp clothing.<p>Plastic-based synthetics are harder to iron than cotton.<p>> Most of the clothes I buy is 95% cotton, 5% spandex or 90% nylon and 10% spandex. I don't own an iron but can't afford to show up at work all wrinkled -- it's a violation of the dress code. Knits with a little spandex generally avoids that issue altogether.<p>Ah, no iron. Buy one [1], since they are cheap and handy.<p>Spandex knits shouldn't make such a big deal. One trick is to use a setting on your dryer (if you use a dryer) usually labelled something like ""perm press"". Make sure you use 2 dryer sheets for anything over a 5kg dry load and plenty of softner, and then take the clothes out of the dryer the moment they are done and hang them up. Your clothes, after a night, should lose their creases just through gravity.<p>Protip: good quality suit jackets and blazers should never touch an iron via this method. Don't let that ugly iron shine ever appear on your clothes.<p>> So, I have thought about a DIY approach to solve my problem and also thought that the amount of work involved, well, it might make sense to do it as a business rather than jump through all these hoops to dress one person.<p>It's a great idea. With the kind of upscale market that you are looking into, you could definitely look into getting value-added garments and fabrics sourced from duty-free countries.<p>Good luck! Please let me know if I can offer you any advice on starting up.

It's only a few dollars a kilo to air something from Asia to the United States (there are obviously some minimums).<p>[edit] Talk to shippers for both air and partial containers. Offer them back their quote at 50% and negotiate from there.<p>There are plenty of boutique garment laundries in LA that air garments from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh or China and process them in small lots in their laundries and sell them on the LA fashion scene. If you see a washed t-shirt selling for over $75 around there, that is a good indicator that this is what is happening.",1286053283

- through their own human vote, 
- through the power lobbying, which allows them to not only influence votes in congress but even to initiate legislative cycles with laws which are usually written by a lobbyist or a former lobbyist in the staff of a congressman.
Excuse my tone, but please wake up people!  I am ready to do something about it beyond voting (some sort of activism).  Are you?",1286053207

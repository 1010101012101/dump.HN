There&#x27;s old servers running ancient (pre-2004) perl scripts alongside the brand new iCloud gear. I can&#x27;t imagine how the authentication for AppleID is working as login details still work on the ancient pages (think pinstripes and glassy buttons). Depending what URL you hit, the webserver is using php3, php4, perl, python or maybe WebObjects (java).</i><p>> <i>At one point I wrote a scraper that was targeting one of their product pages, and kept getting random, unexplainable results. It turned out that one of their product areas was behind a round-robin load balancer, with three completely different apache versions on each server. The page was dying on one but not the other two. In the end I just had to repetitively scrape until I hit a good response.</i><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6078854"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6078854</a>",1376125143

I haven&#x27;t run across one in the field.<p>> We need a fixed set of language extensions which are always available.<p>This sounds very much like a language standard. Haskell isn&#x27;t much different than other languages here, though the language committee is slow to ratify generally accepted extensions into the standard. GHC at least makes them available to people who want to kick the tires. Then read about closures in Java. Look at C++11 revisions and notice that sometimes meant cutting features, even if they were previously implemented by some compilers (template exports) or prototyped (concepts).",1376125080

It&#x27;s not even Stockholm syndrome, I just don&#x27;t use records that much anymore. The various lens packages can help with record overloading and dot indexed fields, but without some compiler support it will remain a sore spot for people who want/need a better record system.<p>#5 is a fair to a point. I don&#x27;t find MPTC or existential types to be useful in almost any case: I actively try to avoid both.

And everything that you value, whether it&#x27;s Shakespeare, Beethoven, da Vinci, or whatever, will be gone. The earth will be gone. The sun will be gone. There&#x27;ll be nothing. The best you can do to get through life is distraction. Love works as a distraction. And work works as a distraction. You can distract yourself a billion different ways. But the key is to distract yourself.<p>I love this statement; there is so much truth in it. I find it is something that enters the realm of my thought quite often. The fact that at some time in my life the last event will rob me of everything I am, I know, and will render everything I have done useless to my then forgone reality. Between the truths of death of an individual and death of the universe, nihilism seems all too logical.<p>However, knowing this,I&#x27;m in no way a depressed individual. I don&#x27;t think I could be any happier in my life. Nihilism has given me freedom.",1376122824

Maybe the cummunication capacity and the terrorist threat has developped to fast for taking the time tothink of the optimal approach in terme of efficiency and respect of privacy and rights. The strategy used so far is not ok. I fully agree and we need methods to ensure there is no abuse like for the civil forfeiture law.<p>This is the role of the feedback control loop.

Secrecy, and keeping the control to some arbitrary authority, is preventing to have such objective and independent feedback control loop.

Apple are known for their strong brand and taking down the dev centre for so long must have been an awkward decision between the marketing side and the technical one.<p>I don&#x27;t know the extent of the problem but taking down an online service for weeks is very uncommon. I guess (speculating a bit) that Apple could have applied a quick fix to the problem within a day to save their (short term, at least) brand appearance. I think &quot;just getting it secure enough&quot; is the most many people would do if an important service was down. It appears that Apple took the time required to deploy a proper fix, prioritising security over shot term wins.<p>It would be interesting to see what someone like Microsoft or Amazon would have done in this situation, or what Apple would have done if it was all of iTunes instead of the dev centre.",1376122414

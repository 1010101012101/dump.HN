This map shows the street price of a gram of ""cocaine"", as advertised, but it doesn't tell us anything about the purity of that gram. A recent police report in the UK suggested street purity had dropped from 30% to around 9%, compared to the 70% of stuff hot out of the factory. A recent government sponsored report on drugs misuse in Britain found the supply chain to be completely flexible: big busts higher up the chain would simply result in more cutting agents added lower down, with customers seemingly willing to pay standard street price for whatever purity they could get. Demand is rising, if anything. It's interesting that police have now turned their attention to the supply chain of the cutting agents. We're fighting a war on laxatives.",1246012992

675241,comment,674399,674399,0,0,chibea,,,"<i>The authors speculate that this is because some people just can't handle the meaninglessness of programming</i><p>I think he cited the paper wrong here: It's not the meaninglessness of <i>programming</i> but the meaninglessness of <i>programs</i>. And it is obviously not meant, that a program makes no sense, but that a formalism can stand on its own, without any purpose. Programming, however, is creating programs for a purpose, thus, abstracting facts into a formalism and after running the program interpreting its results is not meaningless at all. \nI think I can back the observations of the original paper. I occured people which seem to plainly don't get what a program does. They are not talking about what they themselves told the computer to do but they are speculating why the program/computer isn't doing what it ought to do (what its purpose is).<p>I disagree with Steve's opinion that the level of abstraction is a general problem. I started programming early, and I hit walls all the time. Back from the early times to now I always found things I just couldn't grok. For long years I couldn't understand programming graphical things at all. I watched with awe how my three years older neighbor could program animations on his C64, all I managed to do were Fahrenheit to Celsius converters. Later I was crazy enough to start learning C++ with only knowing BASIC before. It took days to get 'Hello World' running. I kept trying and eventually I found the right book which made me understand OOP. Programming some graphics came very late. And the list still goes on...\nI can read a book without understand a thing. I come back to the book (or suddenly remember details) some weeks, months, years later and manage to understand what is going on.<p>The same applies to other areas: Playing piano is something where you hit your personal wall all the time. Sure, there is a natural anatomical caused level of virtuosity which simply can't be overcome. (See Robert Schumann, who tried to hack his weakest finger which ultimately failed) But there are ""mental barriers"" which can only be overcome (aside from exercising) by keeping cool and sometimes stop trying to come back to it later.<p>Another example: As a child I always divided the physical world from the living world (the christian heritage?). As such it was for a long time unthinkable that creatures are made from the same stuff as everything else. I recall that accepting this knowledge was really hard...<p>Regarding the original paper (they've done much research, I can only guess and tell from observation): The humps they observe, couldn't they just be the indication of a clear mental barrier which has to be overcome? Perhaps being taught and some pressure is just not enough to grok these abstract facts about programming? Perhaps, what is needed is just time to (un)consciously chew on the ideas? So, shouldn't be children exposed to 'some programming stuff' as early as  possible?<p>In Germany at least it is left to chance when children become exposed to programming. In most regions there is no teaching at all before a pupil is about 16 years old (11-th grade).",1246012907

675230,comment,674128,675176,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Yeh ok your right - struggling bands was a poor statement (my Brother is actually a musician so I do have an insight into it).<p>Also what I actually said was:\n> a decline in published music quality<p>Music will have to be published on the cheap = bad quality. Yes there will be lots of great music online (there already is) but no one will sieze it and market in the same way. In the future I think there will be lots of user-centric acts who get little coverage outside their sites and genre's.<p>So this is the thing: your pitching promotion on a free-ish model potentially awash with thousands of good artists. It could be argued a large percentage of the gig attendance was from people who listened to your CD's - and again it's not a huge stretch to say that in many cases they were driven to the CD by advertising (especially for bands who are relativewly ""unknown"") - by advertising I include radio plays (which are often prompted by press releases etc.) and other hype. It is in the interest of the producers to sell the CD's so they invest in marketing the bands. In a free model there isnt any point in marketing the band - so the vast majority will never achieve the critical mass to make live gigs worthwhile.<p>I could well be wrong - but then again I think it's more a case of a ""bit of both"". I suspect we will see a decline in large music publishers, and will see a lot less ""global bands"".<p>So yes it was an emotional reaction (it's hot and the office has 20 computers in it compounding the issue :D) Im just somewhat fed up of the many people who keep bemoaning the media industry despite huge leaps forwards in the last 18 months - it's getting their slowly but is constantly hampered (as I see it) by those who just want something for nothing (and argument I just havent had sold to me yet :P).<p>Im not saying a free model cannot work (im sure it can). I just argue that some of the main exponents of the model consider it their right to access media for free on their terms - again something I personally strongly disagree with. Copyright is broken: but no protection at all? That's just wrong IMO.",1246011917

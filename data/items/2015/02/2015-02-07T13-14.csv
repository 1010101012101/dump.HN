I do it partly because it is cheaper but also partly because I find it sad that e-filing is not easier and more cost effective for the government to handle than a paper submission (if it is, it is sad that the government is not incentivizing it through cost). Maybe the government just prints the e-filed return out and adds it to the stack of mailed in returns to be processed. It seems like there would be big gains in efficiency if the government had a standard digital submission protocol, if they could get past the initial cost to develop it and could handle the security issues it would entail.",1423316224

Many state parties have POS data sets that still rely on a top-down method of data insertion that sucks. Also, the more rural you get the less accurate the data is. (Although, there are other methods of voter ID for rural voters.)<p>I remember reading Zell Miller(former Georgia Gov, and Senator)&#x27;s Biography. There was a story about his mother being the chairwoman of the Young Harris Democratic Party. The job of the party chair in those days (great depression era) was keeping the party files which consisted of notebooks, notecards, file folders etc on every voter in the county. family information, social relationships, interests, pain points. which is the exact same information that is valuable in politics today, just gathered by different means.",1423314191

No dice - they wanted to see numbers north of $20m/year for sizable exit before they&#x27;d be willing to put in.. $500k.  Those numbers always struck me as insane, but have stuck with me (this was... 15 years ago perhaps now).",1423314144

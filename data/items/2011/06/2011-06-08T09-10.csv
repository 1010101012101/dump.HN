In practice it seems the ISPs are unwilling to pay for the bandwidth so our connectivity ranges from ok to unusable. Having said that, things have improved enormously over the last few years, and maybe it just takes a while for customer expectations to adjust, and competition amongst ISPs to develop.",1307527154

In that regard, although iCloud has the cloud word in it, it's not a true cloud at all. Apple is turning the cloud idea on its head, and saying the cloud should only work with certain devices and operating systems, like theirs.<p>All their ""cloud"" services are native applications and their cloud iTunes doesn't even stream the music. You're still supposed to download it on your Apple device. But wasn't the point of music streaming to save storage space, so you wouldn't have to keep your thousands of songs on the device? Are you going to download every song one by one to your device to listen to them when you move to another Apple device? All their cloud services seem to be made so they lock you in the Apple ecosystem even more.",1307527090
2632570,comment,2630888,2630888,1,0,CrLf,,,"Recently there seems to be an increasing hate towards academia in particular, usually ranting about how it is too theoretical and how it doesn't prepare you for the ""real world"".<p>Funny enough, this seems to come more often from people who either never went through college, or failed at it for whatever reason. Which can be fine, for people who are dedicated enough to actually learn on the job, instead of just acquiring habits and repeating them over and over.<p>What isn't fine is this praise for superficial knowledge. What irks me the most is people praising their ignorance of what academic knowledge really offers, and how it can change some of your solutions (many times unknowingly) in the ""real world"".<p>Practice does not replace fundamental knowledge. Practice only teaches you the solutions for the problems you encounter, not the solutions to the problems other people have encounterer over time, and the underlying reasons for the solutions you are using.<p>It this particular case there isn't so much ""anti-intellectualism"", but a justification for ignorance.",1307527026

So I would usually buy a bike second-hand for the equivalent of about 40 USD. So long as it had straight wheels, working brakes, a maintained chain and gears and a solid frame, I was good to go. (Cables / tyres / tubes I could replace / fix myself. Other repairs wouldn't make a lot of economic sense.)<p>A heavier bike is slightly harder to push up hills and harder to accelerate, but if fitness is your concern, it's immaterial IMO. Spending a lot of money on a lighter bike strikes me as a waste of money. Actually, spending more than the equivalent of 200 USD on a new bike would strike me as foolish.<p>Of course, if your the sort of person who would only ride in a circle from your house, or your car after having driven your bicycle somewhere, then feel free to ignore all my words of wisdom.",1307526954

That is, hands down, one of the most pleasant walks I've had the joy of taking. I absolutely love the Microsoft main campus and think their design blends in perfectly. I'm not sure how to describe it but it just has this Seattle feel that makes the buildings seem very harmonious with the lush greenery of Seattle. If I had the chance, I'd probably pick that area over almost any other in the country to walk.<p>In case you can't tell, I've been back in Chicago for a year now and the weather is absolutely killing me.",1307524029

I guess he's referring to works of fiction and philosophy that require long linear reading, not reference material.<p>3) Classics are called ""classics"" because they convey fundamental ideas that shape our society. I would argue, though, that the problem is that ""classics"", as in ""seminal books"" are not being written anymore. Btw, Socrates never wrote anything.<p>4) True, i dont see what's bad about foregoing memorization of facts that are not relevant to one's pursuit.<p>5) Getting through college is just the start for academics. Making a profound discovery is the goal and it's much more difficult than making a moderately successful business.

Literally, they read ""insert, in paragraph 5a, after 'is the domain of', 'Hacker News and'<p>The GPO, however, only prints the full code once every six (six!) years. They've got a room full of people reading and double-checking that they're writing exactly what's in the bills. Very archaic. Someone should apply a modern versioning system so the code is in black and the effects of bills are in red (and blue and green, like alexa or Google Trends does graphs, but with text), so the public can see not just the bill, but what the changes look like in real time. It's shouldn't be hard at all.<p>I'll bet someone could do this with GitHub by this weekend and have a site up by the end of the month.",1234938091

So an architect made a bridge very, very strong</i><p>That's not the entire reason. In the Roman Empire, an engineer was required to stand under his bridge while a Legion marched over it. That was their beta testing. His interests were therefore fully aligned with those of his end users. On Wall Street, the interests of the bankers were not correctly aligned with their investors.

485430,comment,485349,485349,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"My thoughts (with the obvious grain of salt)...<p>The background sound is distracting<p>When you first create the course you copy and paste the info in.  I've found this can be confusing to users (though I don't know why).  I'd put in a small part that says ""I've prewritten this text and am just going to copy it in to save time"".  It just spells it out for the user and lets them know they aren't missing anything (You do it perfectly during the ""creating a lesson"" part, I'd just move that up to the beginning)<p>At :48 you move forward only to move back.  I've found that it's best to stay linear with the steps.  Don't move back and fourth.  Refer back later if you have to but when people are watching a demo they expect to see it step by step not jumping all around.<p>Again, when you add the remaining lessons I'd personally put a hard pause.  So say something like ""I'm going to pause the video for a second to add the rest of the lessons""<p>Overall I'd slow down the whole presentation and ditch the recap at the end.  It's a video that people can rewind so they don't need a recap.  At the same time you do speed through a lot of the demo (you have to on some level sense this since you felt the need for a recap to begin with).<p>Anyway, hope it helps",1234937686

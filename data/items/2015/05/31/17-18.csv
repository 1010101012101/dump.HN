It makes communication between processes easier than writing BSD sockets code by hand.<p>For example, the Mongrel2 web server uses ZeroMQ to drive backend handlers. You probably wouldn&#x27;t dream of transporting HTTP requests and responses over a brokered message queue, but ZeroMQ is different since it&#x27;s &quot;just sockets&quot;.",1433095137

It is a large community and hundreds of projects, e.g. independent ZeroMQ versions in Java, .Net, C++, Erlang, C. Nano is one library and bindings.<p>Take a look at the git repositories and the email list and you really see the significant differences. These aren&#x27;t technical. They&#x27;re why the ZeroMQ community merges pull requests rapidly, and products tend to be stable on master, while Nano has pull requests hanging for months, and isn&#x27;t stable.<p>Nano should have been compatible with ZeroMQ, then it would have been a successor and the protocols could have evolved over time to become what Sustrik wanted. Instead it tried to define itself by one-upping ZeroMQ, missing many opportunities. ZeroMQ has so much stuff built on top. Nano? So little.<p>This is not accidental or random. The ZeroMQ community is welcoming to people, and every effort is welcome, unless it&#x27;s really disruptive. Nano is just a the wrong side of hostile, arrogant, and insecure and it shows in the arguments on the mailing list (which we just don&#x27;t get on zeromq-dev).<p>Edit: by &quot;not stable&quot;, I refer to its &quot;0.5 beta&quot; status, not any technical instability.

IMAP mail storage, for example, decouples your mail folders and messages from whatever client you use, or whether you&#x27;re using a work computer at work or a laptop at home or a phone wherever. Databases are essentially the same thing, for more general data.<p>So why not tabs, or bookmarks for that matter. I think you have a sweet project in front of you, if you&#x27;re in to it. Start small, if you start, but think big while you&#x27;re small.<p>Side note, I&#x27;ve often thought about similar things, and thought about using IMAP as a ready made decoupled database. Unfortunately you&#x27;d have to implement your &quot;schema&quot; through convention in your folders/messages/data.

For your purposes, you might tag a page/tab, and untag it when you&#x27;re done with it, then use the associated RSS feed to view what&#x27;s currently associated with that tag(s).<p>Finally, when all is lost, the Firefox addon OneTab allows you to easily declare tab bankruptcy, taking all your open tabs and placing them on a list on a page, then closing the tabs. <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/</a><p>Ah, their home page says it&#x27;s also available for Chrome. <a href=""http://www.one-tab.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.one-tab.com/</a>",1433094267

Lots of libraries provide implementations that provide memoization or parameter checking on both functions and methods.<p>So in the short term, decorators serve only to work around the fact that ES-6 classes actually make this more difficult than ES-5 idioms.<p>But in the long term, a decorator can be extended to deal with static analysis, while functions provid eno such capability, so we’d be back to having “magic comments,” or inventing a new kind of pragma.<p>So, I’d say that the motivation is to lay the groundwork for things involving static analysis or manipulation of programs.

I&#x27;m a total feminist who believes that the significance of male rape is hugely devalued by society, that family court relies on outdated standards, and a few other &#x27;MRA&#x27; bulletpoints. I find nothing but agreement when I pursue these ideas in a public, academic, or otherwise serious sphere. The Men&#x27;s Rights movement, however, is not a legitimate offshoot of a cruel and uncaring feminism. It&#x27;s a reactionary, hostile internet culture that inevitably finds itself tied up in aggressive takedowns of feminism, responsible for fomenting a lot of denial of its legitimacy through a cherry-picked view of fringe perspectives, poorly considered, half-scientific &#x27;biotruths&#x27; and a thin veneer of concern for the rights of men.<p>Feminism is not called feminism because it hates men. It&#x27;s called feminism because it comes from societies with a history of gross, outrageous repression of women. As we move closer to equality, it becomes natural that men should involve themselves in the movement and ensure that it considers their rights as well. But feminism does that. MRA denies that only as a stepladder to get into a denial of the legitimacy of the female accomplishments of feminism. That&#x27;s what it is at its core.&quot;</i><p>I was very impressed. I conceded, and it&#x27;s stuck with me to this day.",1433092621

It&#x27;s easy to code up one page, but when you get to having to build out multiple pages with different elements, it really makes you step back and start to componentize your CSS and make you think modularly. Nothing will beat experience and familiarizing yourself with different scenarios. When I was starting out, I went this route and utilized Experts Exchange when I got stuck. Great community over there (or at least 10ish years ago...)<p>If you&#x27;re not a designer, take a popular webpage and build your own version of it, then look at the real source code and see how yours compares, or ask some CSS forum members to look over your code.<p>Build a library of frequently used styles. I have something like the following:<p>.small {font-size: 12px;}\n.big {font-size: 16px;}\n.bigger {font-size: 18px;}\n.biggest {font-size: 20px;}<p>...and it extends from everything like font sizes to colors.<p>.red {color: #f00;}<p>Then when you&#x27;re building something out, you can reference generic styles from your own library.

And Westlaw and LexisNexis have done a pretty good job with those. It&#x27;s not easy (or rather, it&#x27;s not cheap -- think tens of millions of dollars) to build what they have built. Even Google hasn&#x27;t with Scholar -- though to be fair, Google hasn&#x27;t tried very hard to get legal search to that level.<p>Ultimately, in the future legal search is not going to be a money maker, and Westlaw and LexisNexis will take a big hit when free happens.<p>As I see it (i.e., from the vantage point of Judicata), search will ultimately be free, just as Google search is free. And just as Google has been able to make boatloads of money on &quot;ancillaries&quot; to the results (ads), the ancillaries will be the big money makers here -- but in the forms of extremely precise analytics and AI.

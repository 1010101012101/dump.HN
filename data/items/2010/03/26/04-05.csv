Of course they are going to keep the numbers low.  11,000 (the last number I found) new doctors every year is simply NOT enough. It may be a little bit higher, but last I researched, for years it was 10,000 and only after a lot of controversy did they increase it to 11,000.<p>The system is designed to force doctors into debt so they have to be money focused and charge a lot and keep rates high for all the other doctors.  The doctors, many of whom are my long time friends, are <i>not</i> happy with the system.  They want more freedom. They feel like slaves to debt. One good friend left grad school with over $250,000 in debt!  It takes a long time to pay that off. She can't take on more debt to open a private practice, nor would she have the experience really -- she's forced into the big hospital system that she <i>knows</i> is flawed, but she's powerless to change it because the huge medical institutions call the shots, not the doctors.  We think doctors are invincible and make tons of money, but if they lose their jobs -- it's a horrible experience, because it'll be very difficult for them to find another job -- doctors talk and bankruptcy doesn't clear student loan debt, so even <i>that</i> isn't an option.<p>Add to that, the fact that individuals aren't even allowed to care for their own medical well being and you have a system that is <i>way</i> unfairly balanced toward doctors and away from patients.  Not even the doctors really, the hospitals.<p>Why, in the ""leader of the free world"" are individuals not free to care for themselves? Prescribe their own medications?  Order their own labs and CAT scans and the like?<p>Why do we give the AMA so much power?  Why don't patients have any over their <i>own</i> lives?<p>I suppose patients do have <i>some</i> power -- over the doctors.  There are doctors out there who send patients with viruses out with antibiotics because the patient <i>wants</i> something.  They prescribe drugs from tv commercials because the patient wants something.  Why do we let them do this?  There should be laws against prescribing antibiotics for people who don't have bacterial infections.  I know that and I'm not a doctor, but doctors still do it.<p>There's really something wrong with our system.  It's <i>completely</i> irrational.  There's simply <i>too</i> much money in it and people go crazy.",1269579300

How many businesses are handing out big bonuses, salary increases, and raises?  I can't imagine many businesses are, as they're doing their best to keep the penny pinching going on during a down economy.  Unpaid internships are just another business decision that you can more easily get away with today since the competition is so fierce that they're able to offer $0 / month just for the chance to get work experience.<p>One of my friends is currently struggling to get a job working in CAD.  It's so bad in that sector of the economy, jobs he's been tentatively offered have been taken away by people who called in after their interview saying they'll work for less than the advertised wage.  It cannot be that surprising to think that a college undergrad with ZERO work experience would work for free when he has to compete against so many with years experience that they're willing to underbid him on price, on top of having a shinier resume to boot.",1269576081

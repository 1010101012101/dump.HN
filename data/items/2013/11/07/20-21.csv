6692335,comment,6690559,6691222,1,0,lambda,,,"CSS was originally designed only for inline and block layout in a traditional single column of text with left or right floated figures. It has never had any features specifically designed for full page layout, but people have done lots of hacks to use inline, block, margins, padding, and floats to achieve full-page layouts they were never designed for.<p>There have been improvements in CSS2 and CSS3, like adding table layout so people could at least use the table layout features on div elements rather than abusing tables for layout, and CSS flexbox that work well for standard UI widget layouts.<p>But the big fixes to layout have been harder to specify and agree upon. They&#x27;ve been in the works for many years, but it&#x27;s taken a while to figure out how they really should work, and which parts should be fundamental. It looks like it&#x27;s getting a lot closer; the CSS Grid Module <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-grid/</a> is being treated as the fundamental part of the stack on which others will build, it is being worked on by several browser vendors and is in highly active development, and several browsers have implementations in development.

It&#x27;s going to get better very soon, however, once the CSS Grid Module is finished and implemented.

6692321,comment,6691214,6691214,15,0,tptacek,,,"Ladar Levison could not have missed Moxie Marlinspike&#x27;s point more completely if he had heard that Moxie&#x27;s post was coming and bought a ticket to a tropical island where there was no Internet for the expressed purpose of avoiding it.<p>Start by understanding this: end-to-end (e2e) security is not a crazy pipe dream. It can be accomplished today, using tools with graphical interfaces that are available on all mainstream platforms. Though we could surely use better, more convenient tools for providing it, there&#x27;s no valid argument that is premised on e2e being intractable.<p>Marlinspike&#x27;s argument was simple. Levison&#x27;s site made expansive claims about its security properties. Marlinspike highlighted them. Then he explained how the system could only provide those properties under an &quot;avert-your-eyes&quot; attack model, because it was fundamentally a plaintext-in plaintext-out system. It could provide no security without Levison&#x27;s own say-so, but could subvert its users the moment Levison&#x27;s will or capabilities broke.<p>Levison replies with a series of technical details that are irrelevant to the avert-your-eyes problem. Levison thinks that marking memory secure was a meaningful countermeasure against a state-sponsored adversary (compelled disclosure was his stated threat model), because attackers would not have had the source code. This is a baffling statement in an era where people reverse engineer smartphone basebands for fun, because it&#x27;s an obstacle that the FBI would have had no trouble surmounting in 1999.<p>Similarly, Levison&#x27;s surprise that the DOJ could compel him to hand over TLS keys (in a configuration that Marlinspike points out wasn&#x27;t even forward-secure --- that is, a configuration that provided sub-Google levels of resilience versus DOJ) doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with Marlinspike&#x27;s argument. If Levison&#x27;s own keys determine the security of the system, it is an avert-your-eyes system. However meaningful you believe avert-your-eyes promises to be, the are undeserving of promotional security copy that discusses the details of asymmetric encryption.<p>Levison argues that it&#x27;s unfair to judge his system by the standard of PGP. His system was designed solely to protect emails at rest. But that&#x27;s a meaningless distinction, obviously so, because Levison had to shut his system down after being compelled to reveal keys that could decrypt prior sessions. Plaintext-in plaintext-out mail encryption is like a bulletproof vest you store in your attic --- perhaps useful for protecting you against bullets flying in your attic, but little else.<p>I believe we need two kinds of privacy enhancements: laws that constrain the actions of governments and limit the scope of investigations, <i>and</i> better privacy-enabling technology. But I have no illusions about which of those two enhancements users should rely on: they should ignore the limitations supposed for governments, and choose technologies that offer end-to-end security, where the endpoints make the judgement calls about the degree of safety they have, <i>not</i> the operator of the service.<p>And while that concludes my direct response to Levison&#x27;s post, I&#x27;d like to make a tangential argument:<p>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t trying to fix security, only improve it&quot; has for the last 20 years been the siren song of bad security systems. It lured customers into the rocks in the 1990s when it was used to rationalize stack canaries as a cure for memory corruption vulnerabilities, shipwrecked web developers with promises of &quot;smart quoting&quot;, got Hushmail customers backdoored, inspired 100 different secret-salt password hashes, installed tens of thousands of packet sniffing &quot;intrusion detection&quot; systems on networks around the globe, and got us elliptic curve-based chat systems... incorrectly implemented in browser Javascript.<p>Alarm bells should go off in your head when you hear that sentiment spoken aloud. Loud ones. If you start to feel persuaded by it, tie your self to the mast: reinstall GPG, generate new keys, and refuse to send plaintext messages.",1383857733

6692302,comment,6690297,6692014,5,0,smacktoward,,,"The question of how intimately Windows and IE are tied together is a longstanding one, and in fact was a central issue in the antitrust case against MS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp."" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp...</a>). The question was discussed at length in Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson&#x27;s findings of fact (<a href=""http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm</a>):<p><i>In contrast to other operating system vendors, Microsoft both refused to license its operating system without a browser and imposed restrictions  at first contractual and later technical  on OEMs&#x27; and end users&#x27; ability to remove its browser from its operating system. As its internal contemporaneous documents and licensing practices reveal, Microsoft decided to bind Internet Explorer to Windows in order to prevent Navigator from weakening the applications barrier to entry, rather than for any pro-competitive purpose...</i><p><i>Microsoft&#x27;s executives believed that the incentives that its contractual restrictions placed on OEMs would not be sufficient in themselves to reverse the direction of Navigator&#x27;s usage share. Consequently, in late 1995 or early 1996, Microsoft set out to bind Internet Explorer more tightly to Windows 95 as a technical matter. The intent was to make it more difficult for anyone, including systems administrators and users, to remove Internet Explorer from Windows 95 and to simultaneously complicate the experience of using Navigator with Windows 95. As Brad Chase wrote to his superiors near the end of 1995, &quot;We will bind the shell to the Internet Explorer, so that running any other browser is a jolting experience.&quot; ...</i><p><i>Starting with Windows 95 OSR 2, Microsoft placed many of the routines that are used by Internet Explorer, including browsing-specific routines, into the same files that support the 32-bit Windows APIs. Microsoft&#x27;s primary motivation for this action was to ensure that the deletion of any file containing browsing-specific routines would also delete vital operating system routines and thus cripple Windows 95.</i><p>So while it was originally a marketing decision -- the two were tied together specifically to put competitors at a disadvantage -- the implementation of that decision was <i>not just</i> marketing. It was implemented technically too, to the point where removing IE from a copy of Windows would break the OS. So regardless of the motivation behind the decision, the fact remains that the two things are tangled up with each other quite deeply.<p>Microsoft <i>could</i> have gone back at a later point and un-tangled them, but that would have been a huge project, and there was no real motivation for them to do so -- the settlement agreement that ended the antitrust case didn&#x27;t require them to, and the market wasn&#x27;t rejecting Windows with IE tied into it. So it stayed tangled up.<p>The big irony is that by tying the OS and browser together to get an advantage over their competitors, they ended up disadvantaging <i>themselves</i>. Those competitors can now turn out new versions of their browsers at a fast clip, because they&#x27;re not tied to any release schedule other than their own.

According to the EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on stock exchanges, making it impossible for investors to either purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. As such, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and that the only way an investor can possibly obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier investments.<p>At the very least, if not me, Warren Buffett has shown that the market does in fact exhibit large-scale persistent opportunities. You just have to be patient. I don&#x27;t think &quot;arbitrage&quot; is actually the relevant term here. It has a very specific meaning that isn&#x27;t simply a stock being mispriced. Really though, the market offers deals all the time.<p>FWIW, I don&#x27;t have Buffett&#x27;s track record, but I currently have 20 stocks in my portfolio most of which I&#x27;ve held for several years. Of those, 19 have made money and 1 has lost a small amount, and on the whole I&#x27;ve beaten the market nicely. I could just be written off as lucky, or as about to lose lots of money, but how do you explain Buffett? He has a track record of consistently beating the market by wide margins for 50 years.

Two alternative explanations, which are not mutually exclusive:<p>1. Most people don&#x27;t like confrontation or rejection; they find it awkward and uncomfortable, even if it&#x27;s done politely. After interrupting you a few times, they find that they are generally rebuffed, so they stop interrupting you.

They may not really understand <i>why</i> you&#x27;re redirecting them to asynchronous communication; they don&#x27;t have a good mental model of how you will respond.

6692194,comment,6690607,6690607,6,0,tony_landis,,,"I think it was Rich Hickey that said the document database is the worst of them all, because you are now married to that structure.<p>Having used Couchdb in production for two years, I have to agree with his analysis, and offer my own opinion that Couchdb is highly overrated. Not because it is not a good implementation of a document style database, but because the document store itself is not a good match for most use cases.<p>If the only requirement is a replicated JSON document store, it may work OK for you. But so would Riak, Postgres and some others.<p>If you need to update the data in those documents or ever need to query the data in ways you did not initially envision, you will quickly find yourself missing features which even traditional SQL databases are very good at. Development is slower.<p>Writing map/reduce for queries seems particularly cumbersome, particularly if you prefer not to use Javascript. And you have to plug them into a textarea in a webpage interface, or manually put them into Couchdb over http using curl or some library that abstracts this away. Either way it is a degree of separation that makes the data feel more out of reach than through  a console interface like psql or mysql.<p>Consider the scenario where you want to update the value in an attribute on several thousand, or even just several documents that match some criteria. In SQL, you would simply jump in the console and in a few seconds or minutes complete that as a transaction with something like:<p>> update table set col=val where criteria.<p>There is no such feature in Couchdb. You will need to write code to filter and fetch each matching document, manipulate it as needed, then write the entire thing back. All to update a few bits that hopefully were not nested too deep as that really increases the complexity of the code you will need to write.<p>As memracom stated, the replication is not perfect. My experience even on a low latency network is the only safe way to ensure a client can immediately read back what they just wrote is to pass them through the likes of haproxy and use a sticky session. Otherwise you have a good probability of getting a 404 after a POST (create) or stale data after a PUT (update).<p>So for what it is worth, here is my advice on choosing a database from an ease of development standpoint:<p>1) has as many features as you can, even if you don&#x27;t need them initially\n2) has top notch libraries for your language / framework\n3) has relation awareness - do not denormalize unless you must\n4) supports consistency\n5) supports in place updates - easily filter and change values (doesn&#x27;t apply to Datomic)\n6) has tools to make schema changes / reshaping data is easy, and can be done online<p>Maybe 2 years ago Couchdb was a great solution. But with memory and ssd storage being so cheap and so much innovation with traditional and NoSQL DBs, I don&#x27;t foresee myself deploying Couchdb again. If I did need a place to dump some semi-structured data, I find Amazon&#x27;s hosted offerings more attractive.",1383856471

6692172,comment,6691077,6692047,2,0,FellowTraveler,,,">  the repeal of the parts of Glass-Steagall that separated commercial and investment banks, is what caused the banking catastrophe.<p>This is like saying that pulling a card from a house of cards is what &quot;caused&quot; its collapse. When in fact, the imposition of the unsustainable system onto us in the first place was the true problem. Everything else is just consequences.<p>> despite using (sort of) similar protocols and having (sort of) similar names, these are not similar at all.<p>Both are p2p protocols designed to enable censorship-resistance by eliminating centralized points of failure.<p>Just as Napster was replaced by Bittorrent, so also E-Gold is replaced by Bitcoin. The persecution is actually what is driving the development of these liberating protocols.<p>> What do we regulate that can&#x27;t be swapped for &quot;bitcoin&quot; in that sentence? IE: we can&#x27;t regulate drugs, at best we can only regulate how we plan to use violence against people who use drugs.<p>This is exactly true! We can never &quot;regulate&quot; drugs (or Bitcoin) -- we can only regulate how we use _violence_ against people who use drugs (or Bitcoin.)<p>But the question is, do we have a _right_ to use violence against people who are not thieves and murderers? And is it even possible to delegate such powers?<p>For example, I have a right to defend myself using force. Therefore I have a right to hire a _bodyguard_ to defend me. Therefore we have the right to elect a _sheriff_ to defend us. (In fact it is the same right -- delegated.)<p>But I do NOT have a right to beat and rob people. Therefore, neither do I have any right to hire a _bodyguard_ to beat and rob people.<p>...Therefore, neither does our _sheriff_ have any right to beat and rob people -- even if we voted for him to do so! Because you cannot delegate powers you never had.<p>Perhaps you should be asking what makes us believe, as a society, that we have any right to use violence at all, except in defense from violence. Because if the authorities use violence for any other purpose, then aren&#x27;t they the true criminals?<p>Careful not to throw out the precedent from the Nuremberg Trials -- that just because someone is in authority, doesn&#x27;t give them the right to victimize people. (Even if they were voted into power.)",1383856203

They didn&#x27;t end up selling all of the stock that was issued in the IPO and had to buy up stock back from the market at elevated prices in order to keep the stock from plummeting on the first day. They still made money but not what they expected.<p>As for the insider vs outsider. In order to issue an IPO, a number of stocks are agreed to be issued. These stock either come from the company issuing more shares and diluting the value to current stock holders and the company receives the money from the new share purchase, or the stock holders offer up some of their stock to be sold in which case they receive the money. I believe is usually mix of the two. The current stock holders don&#x27;t offer all of their shares up. Just enough (I believe this is set by the SEC) to enter the market.<p>The underwriter assumes a large risk and for the portion of the stock that goes through them to market, they are paid the $20 difference ($26 to $46). As well they facilitate the actual sale of the shares. This is not an easy task (again see the technical issues with the Facebook IPO).<p>So in the end the 11 rounds of investors get $26 for some of their shares, in order for the rest of them to be worth $46 or now $50. They are also now allowed to sell those remaining shares on the open market. Something they were not able to do before the IPO.<p>No one is getting screwed here.

Basically it&#x27;s just a cartel.<p>I heavily disagree with your assessment that regulation is to blame.  If anything the removal of regulation, specifically the repeal of the parts of Glass-Steagall that separated commercial and investment banks, is what caused the banking catastrophe.<p>> Saying that Bitcoin &quot;may need government regulation&quot; is like saying that Bittorrent &quot;may need government regulation.&quot; The question is, how on earth can you regulate such things, when they are designed to be resistant to such threats?<p>No, despite using (sort of) similar protocols and having (sort of) similar names, these are not similar at all.  Bitcoin will be regulated in these two, and probably more, ways: 1) It will be categorized as an instrument of value, in which case it can be taxed in USD, require licenses to transact with it etc. 2) It will be regulated at the point of currency exchange.<p>> Let&#x27;s not forget also, that policy consists of political decisions regarding the use and threat of force. Therefore we can never actually regulate Bitcoin. At best, we can only regulate how we plan to use violence against people who use Bitcoin.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure I understand fully what you mean here.  What do we regulate that can&#x27;t be swapped for &quot;bitcoin&quot; in that sentence?

6692023,comment,6691077,6691999,8,0,FellowTraveler,,,"Regarding Bitcoins and gold, its important to keep in mind that neither has intrinsic value.<p>Rather, both are valued by men for their unique properties.<p>Gold is:\nDivisible.\nFungible.\nValue dense. (Scarce.)\nRecognizable.\nDurable.\nZero counter-party risk.\nStable in supply, yet minable.\nLiquid.\nInternational.\nNon-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)<p>By comparison:\nDiamonds, while valuable, are NOT divisible, nor are they fungible.\nWater, while valuable and divisible, is not value-dense enough to compete with gold as a form of money, on the free market.\nFood, while valuable, is not durable.\nDollars, while liquid, do not represent zero-counter-party-risk (rather, they are debt-based.)\nDollars, while recognizable, are not stable in supply (inflation is a worry).\nDollars are also not minable. (Production is available only to a monopoly cartel, versus gold, which anyone can produce.)\nFood, which anyone can produce, is not liquid, especially in comparison to dollars or gold.\nDollars, while you can hold them in your pocket, a board of bankers still has the power to reach into your pocket and manipulate its value. (This is not the case with gold.)\nSoon it becomes very clear that gold was never declared to be a form of money by any authorities but rather, became money due to natural market forces.<p>If gold became money strictly due to natural market forces (as a result of its unique properties) then clearly the only reason it has been supplanted by dollars is due to artificial restraints imposed on the market by government force. (Such as legal tender laws, tax laws, money laundering laws, etc.)<p>Such forces must be constantly active, otherwise, natural market forces would immediately resolve back to gold again as they have for thousands of years.<p>Now lets consider Bitcoins unique properties:<p>Divisible.\nFungible.\nValue dense.\nRecognizable.\nDurable.\nZero counter-party risk.\nStable in supply, yet minable.\nLiquid.\nInternational.\nNon-manipulatable. (Non-centralized.)<p>AS WELL AS:\nNon-confiscatable.\nAccounts cannot be frozen.\nAnonymity is possible.\nElectronically transferrable.<p>As you can see, Bitcoins unique properties are similar to those of gold, although it adds new properties due to its ethereal nature.<p>Those new properties (non-confiscatable, non-freezable, pseudonymous, transferrable electronically) all serve to route-around the artificial forces that are currently being used to supplant gold with the dollar. After all, the various immoral, legal-tender legislation in place today uses the force of a gun to impose fiat money onto an economy that would otherwise resolve to gold by natural forces. That artificial force depends on the governments collusion with banks and their collective monopoly on the ability to issue, store, freeze, confiscate, track, and transfer dollars.",1383854579

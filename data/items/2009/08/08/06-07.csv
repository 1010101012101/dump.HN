For me it's always the same: someone is calling out to me, but I can't respond or get up because I'm paralyzed.  Usually I realize what's going on before too long, and it's not a big deal.  But this past Monday, for the first time ever, I managed to not only realize what was going on, but close my eyes, concentrate on my hypnogogic imagery, and transform it into a lucid dream.  If you can pull that off, I'd highly recommend it.",1249713778

That seems like it would suggest to the rook that there's some connection between the cylinder and the rocks.<p>Again, it's still very impressive (especially considering the speed with which the bird puts two and two together), but it's not quite the same as the bird thinking, on its own, ""Hey, you know what would help with this puzzle?

So he setup the minimal website, where <i>he</i> was the backend. It looked like it was automated, but under the hood, he just got emails from forms on the website, and fulfilled them manually. Extremely inefficient, and therefore defeated the purpose of putting it online... except it was an experiment to validate the concept. Which apparently it did (though I've not heard of the actual business, so it may be one of those business parables/lies).<p>However, this approach prevents you from succeeding in businesses that can only become viable once you've solved problems with them that you are <i>yet to come across</i>. You need to go quite a few steps into it before you come across the crucial problem that makes it a viable business. These types of businesses can only be successful if run by visionaries (i.e. people who <i>see</i> with their <i>eyes closed</i>). That is, they require ""faith"", ""confidence"", ""trust"" <i>that is not justified by the available facts</i>. My business is one of these, and I think the secret of it is to be motivated by something other than ""success"", ""fame"" or ""money"", but something intrinsic to the project, that is its own reward.<p>I've not done a survey, but I expect that all revolutionary businesses have some of this in them.",1249712666

Healthcare is unpredictable; you don't know when you'll need it and you hope you never do, but if you do, it could completely bankrupt you and since your life could be on the line you'll do anything to get it.<p>Also unlike food, since we have a massive insurance industry involved to spread the risk of unpredictable and often massive expenses, we've actually created a system that incentivises people to hurt other people by denying claims.

749039,comment,746873,747109,0,0,Dove,,,"A good method.  The skills required to create or navigate a codebase of 100, 5000, or 100,000 lines are different not only in degree but in kind.  Behaviors optimal in the first case can be brutally maladaptive in the last, and vice versa.  A preference for global variables or multi-threaded solutions says a lot about the size of project one is comfortable with.<p>But beyond the practical, what you're really measuring is the ability to break down a large problem, solve individual pieces, reason about how those interact, and iterate.  That is the critical intellectual muscle that makes programmers reliably great.<p>I remember a few projects I abandoned when their size outgrew my ability to comprehend them.  It took multiple attempts with new methods to break through certain complexity barriers.  I could not write a program longer than about 500 lines until I had learned the practical use of subroutines and data structures.  I could not write a program longer than a few thousand lines without a sense of taste when it came to objects and modules.  And I could not write a program of significant size until I reliably turned out code that could be comprehended at a glance after months or weeks away, as my own throughput guaranteed it might be that long between visits to disparate parts of the codebase.",1249711986

OTOH, it's common to see ""deprecated features"", and ActionScript (in flash) has been utterly redesigned a few times. They're still ahead.<p>Another issue applies to patentable inventions. You need to get this right, because you need to file a prov before you can launch. What if you find out your invention doesn't work in some cases, and you need to change it? What if you have improvements? These encourage a perfectionistic approach - but the truth is, you can just file another prov (depending on jurisdiction, they cost $80, so filing several is no real problem). The only danger is that time started ticking on the first one (you have a year), so you're using up your time until you have to expend real money and effort to patent it for real - or let it go.",1249711812

6982959,comment,6981843,6981843,62,0,declan,,,"Marvin, the author of the Wired.com opinion piece, is a smart fellow. But what he ignores is that Congress never handed the FCC the authority to impose Net neutrality regulations on the Internet. Such legislation actually came up for a vote in Congress, and it came close to passage: it was reported favorably out of a Senate committee but was defeated in a House floor vote in 2006: <a href""http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-6081882.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-6081882.html</a><p>Even if you <i>adore</i> the principle of Net neutrality, it&#x27;s reasonable to demand that federal regulatory agencies stick to what Congress authorized them to do. Otherwise you have illegal regulations and bureaucratic turf-grabbing that will not treat the Internet well. Remember Hollywood&#x27;s successful efforts to lobby the FCC to impose &quot;broadcast flags&quot; on computers by bureaucratic fiat? A federal appeals court correctly struck it down as exceeding the agency&#x27;s legal authority, as I wrote here in 2005: <a href""http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-5697719.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-5697719.html</a><p>That same appeals court is currently considering the FCC&#x27;s Net neutrality regulations. BTW, it&#x27;s also the same court that slapped down the FCC&#x27;s first attempt to impose Net neutrality regulations without legal authority in 2010: <a href""http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20001825-38.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20001825-38.html</a><p>If Net neutrality violations become an actual problem, there&#x27;s no shortage of publicity-hungry politicians in Congress (hi, Ed Markey!) who will hold hearings and push legislation forward. Obama will happily sign it. Until then, other government debacles including NSA domestic surveillance and Obamacare should make us wary of federal agencies exceeding their legal authority -- especially after Congress considered and rejected a law that would have given it to them in the first place.",1388375950

With that innovation I would love to see the same on the appliance end where it is trivial to replace the entire code on an appliance. This already exists with IEC320, but if would be nice if everything used IEC320.<p>Then every 5-10 years the industry innovates to dramatically improve one end and then 5-10 years later works to dramatically improve the other end. This would give a very reasonabe 10-20 years between completely replacing all the appliances (or using adapters or switching neither), and 10-20 years between replacing all the wall plates. You wouldn&#x27;t even necessarily have to upgrade every 10-20. If an appliance is working fine on an old appliance to cord standard or a cord to wall standard, you can leave things alone.<p>It was this interface approach that allowed Apple to have one dock connector for the longest time but many different shaped devices, since all that had to be done is replace the plastic dock insert [0].<p>This approach wouldn&#x27;t work for cellphones and laptops, but should work swimmingly for 120v mains since space isn&#x27;t at a premium except in the appliance.<p>[0] <a href""http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT1380/HT1380_02---002-en.pn"" rel""nofollo"">http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/...</a>",1388375664

In summary, the misconception that workers can be meaningfully ranked is based on two faulty assumptions. The first assumption is that each worker can control his or her performance. Deming (1986, 315) estimated that 94 percent of the variation in any system is attributable to the system, not to the people working in the system. The second assumption is that any system variation will be equally distributed across workers. Deming (1986, 353) taught that there is no basis for this assumption in real life experiences. The source of the confusion comes from statistical (probability) theory where random numbers are used to obtain samples from a known population. When random numbers are used in an experiment, there is only one source of variation, so the randomness tends to be equally distributed. This is because samples based on random numbers are not influenced by such things as the characteristics of the inputs and tools (e.g., size of the beads and depressions in the paddles) and other real world phenomena. However, in real life experiences, there are many identifiable causes of variation, as well as a great many others that are unknown. The interaction of these forces will produce unbelievably large differences between people (Deming 1986, 110) and there is no logical basis for assuming that these differences will be equally distributed.2</i>",1388375487

This is a &quot;high-risk strategy&quot;, but it is also empirically true that many rich men are married.[1] Of course, the odds of success in this strategy are also not evenly distributed amongst women as a group, either. Another person could look at that and say that marriage to a rich person is a &quot;risk avoidance&quot; strategy...and again, this may or may not be true. Because wealth and genetic fitness need not correlate, and so your frame of reference on the purpose of strategy quickly turns into quite a bit more complex calculation.<p>[1] Marriage as a legal contract has a financial value; a derivative, with contingent claims on of the underlying (asset) value of couple&#x27;s cumulative/aggregate incomes.",1388375061

I simply wish the US would stop making really foolish decisions that waste blood and treasure on idiotic adventures which harm its standing in the world. I certainly don&#x27;t think that any other power, either historical (e.g. the USSR) or speculative (e.g. China or India) is likely to do a better job, or be any &quot;nicer&quot; than the US has been thus far. But we can always do better, and the way to do better is to recognize past mistakes.",1388372675

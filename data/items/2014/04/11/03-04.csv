7571157,comment,7569692,7570899,6,0,srean,,,"Depends on what you are programming on. If its in a language far removed from the machine your mileage may vary.<p>I have had the opportunity to try out Google&#x27;s implementation of mapreduce implemented in C++ way back in time (6 years ago). These would run on fairly impoverished processors, essentially laptop grade. Have done stuff on Yahoo&#x27;s Hadoop setup as well, these used high end multicore machines provisioned with oodles of RAM (I dont think I should share more than that). If I were to be generous, Hadoop ran 4 times slower as measured by wall clock times. Not only that, Hadoop required about 4 times more memory for similar sized jobs. So you ended up requiring more RAM, running for longer and potentially burning more electricity. This is by no means a benchmark or anything like that, just an anecdote.<p>That Hadoop would require much more memory did not surprise me, that was expected. What was really surprising was that it was so much slower. JVM is one of the most well optimized virtual machines we have out there, but its view of the processor is very antiquated and it does not surface those hardware level advances to the programmer. You pay for a hot-rod machine but run it like an old faithful crown victoria.<p>Four times might not seem like much, for one thing I am being generous, and it makes a big difference when you can make multiple run through the data in a single day and make changes to the code/model. Debugging and ironing out issues is a lot more efficient.<p>I think Hadoop gave Google a significant competitive advantage over the rest, probably still does.",1397188786

7571144,comment,7566069,7570946,4,0,yypark,,,"The point is not the slippery slope of &quot;all boycotts are bad&quot; or &quot;boycott everything!&quot; but rather that we&#x27;ve become too trigger-happy and insular in boycotting non-tech political opinions that while mainstream outside of Silicon Valley, are not inside.<p>The entire debate is on when a boycott is appropriate and grellas is arguing to draw the line farther than the current one that&#x27;s solidifying in tech. Cynically, it just has to do with fitting in with your group politically, be it SF tech or Southern Baptist (no Planned Parenthood donations there) and the point is - what happens when you&#x27;re in the moral minority? Because Rice chose to enter an SF tech company rather than a random American one, there is way more backlash.<p>Ultimately, the Rice situation/backlash has a far stronger business case rather than a pure political boycott, due to objections of surveillance/digital security for cloud providers (hence the entire host outside of America movement). Here I mainly focused on the meta-debate about boycotts, and I suppose grellas decided to comment on the broad pattern given the original article&#x27;s major headlines about the Iraq War.<p>Just like war is not universally wrong, neither are boycotts - it&#x27;s just the degree to which we ask whether they are justified.

Onyx Ashanti[0][1][2] has built an entire performance around it (literally, the the whole system is custom built). And on a sort of parallel track, nerds like Herrmutt Lobby and DZA have done some really remarkable things pushing the boundaries of what can be done with off the shelf MIDI gear[3] as well as with game controllers[4].<p>Perhaps Mi.Mu will be the best execution of a MIDI/OSC glove to date—it will probably have to be if it&#x27;s going to make it on stage with performers like Imogen Heap and Tim Exile.<p>I will say, sometimes an encoder is exactly what you need. Other times what you need is a long throw fader (to say nothing of the very particular engineering of crossfaders for scratch DJs). I hope designers and engineers continue to experiment in this space, but not every conventional interface needs &#x27;disrupting&#x27;, and they certainly don&#x27;t all need to be made wireless. I always feel a bit annoyed when these developments are framed as a breaking down of walls between performer and audience, a paradigm shift away from the dark ages of electronic musicians hunched over banks of knobs and &#x27;checking their email&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a cliché, and I&#x27;m not even sure it maps to reality all that well. I&#x27;m fairly certain Miles Davis spent the majority of his time on stage looking at piano keys. And if not there, at his collaborators. Maybe occasionally a glance towards the audience. Maybe.

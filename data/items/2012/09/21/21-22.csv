Without further understanding, I don't think such a question can be answered.<p>i+1 on the plane is a vector at 45 degrees and a scaling of sqrt(2). So multiplying by it scales your multiplier and rotates it 45 degrees. This is a direct extension of the intuitive understanding given.",1348264795

Here is a summary of some of the worst that I have experienced:<p>1 - Intentionally inconvenient autoloading of a monthly pass.-  They will automatically charge your CC for this but it doesn't load onto your card unless you have tagged on AND off in the specified zones. The even more annoying part is that during the beta period you could just double tag (acts like a refund) at a single station and your monthly would show up.<p>2- Effectively bricking their own card and making $250 worth of mistaken charges.- This is by far the worst I have ever heard about in terms of Clipper fail. I had a two-zone monthly pass autoload setup. I changed it two a one-zone. The next period they charged me for BOTH passes. I asked them for a refund and apparently this PERMANENTLY blocks your card from ever obtaining the pass type that you were refunded for. I discovered this when I changed the autoload back to a two-zone monthly.... and they CHARGED my credit card the $126 but never gave me the pass. Clipper insisted that they never charged me and wanted me to ""prove it.""  It took me somewhere around 5 hours of phone time to get refunds and I still had to buy a brand new clipper card. The mistakes were 100% clipper's fault and it permanently broke my card. I am still waiting for that refund... should have just had my credit card block the charges!",1348264496

Well, this can be avoided by having (a) a tap-point at all doors and in locations within the carriage and (b) accounting for tap-ins/outs correctly by determining your Clipper/Oyster state and the position of the train (ie if you tap-out in between stations, it means you'll alight at the next one).<p>That's kind of what they do for buses in Singapore.",1348264436

4556062,comment,4555888,4555888,3,0,CowboyRobot,,,"I played with this idea when I was doing an algorithmic composition project. I started with a Markov chain analysis of a simple Chopin etude, which gave me parameters, such as:\n- The distance between the lowest and highest note is 2 octaves\n- The key won't change, so there are only 8 notes per octave and given the first parameter, I only had 17 notes to choose from.\n- The shortest note was an 1/8th and the longest was a half. Most were quarters and there were a few dotted quarters (if I recall) so there were 4 note lengths to choose from.\n- The main melody in the original was 4 measures (again, if I recall) so my generated melodies were set to be that length, and always end on the root<p>Given all of these parameters, there were still many thousands of combinations. Applying the Markov chain limited that a lot, but that was only to make it sound like Chopin (which it did, a little). However, most of the thousands of combinations sound like crap, which is not an insignificant point.

In talking, we realized what they do for music clients would be really useful for me as a freelance programmer.<p>Basically, a manager's job is to take care of the business side, so the talent can focus on what they're good at.  So, in a strange experiment, I hired them to act as my agent for programming gigs.  They started taking care of all my negotiation, invoicing, collection, scheduling, etc.<p>It worked out really well for both of us, so we partnered up and started 10x Management, to do this for more people.

The publication of the patent itself is more of a side effect of the desired outcome.<p>Also, just because you don't read patents doesn't mean nobody does.

They came out of a ""software patterns"" movement, inspired by Christopher Alexander's beautiful <i>A Pattern Language</i> about how to make great buildings, to capture various problems that come up frequently in software design and formulate standard solutions to them. The hope was that this would lead to a body of engineering knowledge that people could learn software design from, instead of everyone having to figure this stuff out on their own or (at best) from oral tradition. Also, the idea was to provide a standard vocabulary for common constructs, so for example instead of me saying ""wrap"" and you saying ""delegate to"" we would both say ""decorate"".<p>But it didn't work. Software patterns turned out to be at just the wrong level of abstraction: too generic to be applied directly to real problems and too specific to be good as principles. They confuse inexperienced programmers who are told that good code makes use of patterns and so try to find ways to organize their programs around them. That is disastrous: you get a bunch of abstractions in your code that are not there because of the problem you're trying to solve, but because of preconceived ideas about what good code looks like. What's particularly bad is that the patterns are seductive: they seem to make sense when you read them, but as soon as you get to your concrete problem, it's hard to see how to apply them. If you're inexperienced, you blame yourself and think you're doing it wrong, when what you ought to do is reject the abstraction as not fitting.<p>People who like software patterns will say that of course you're supposed to apply the patterns appropriately, not mechanically. But this leaves you trapped in a circle. If learning the patterns themselves doesn't teach you how to make good code with them, what's the point of learning them, and how <i>do</i> you get good at software design?<p>People who dislike software patterns add that in many cases, the patterns amount to mere code repetition, caused by the fact that a given programming language isn't powerful enough to get rid of the repetition, and that the solution is not (in PG's memorable phrase) to be a human compiler but rather to just use a more powerful language.<p>In my opinion, you'd be much better off just writing real programs to solve interesting problems. No one has a good general theory of programming. What you want is practice. Learning patterns will fill your head with a lot of abstract gobbledygook without telling you which bits are useful in specific cases. Don't start with a solution or a set of solutions in mind; always start from and return to the problem itself. It will tell you what to do, or at least what to try. Your job is to try those things and see which ones fit - they are the ones that solve part of the problem without adding extrinsic complexity.<p>Learn your language well. Learn more than one language. Read other people's code, especially by anyone you think is particularly good. Finally, when you write a program, think hard about whether you could do it more simply: that, over time, is the royal road to good software design.<p>And if you want to get stronger in CS, avoid software patterns and software process and most of what's called software engineering, and just learn more about the classics, like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, compilers.",1348263650

Once you have done that it's a simple case of setting up mysqldump to create timestamped .sql files and setting that up on a cron job to rsync to the remote server via SSH (you need to generate a key pair and copy the public key to the other end).<p>If you are using characters from weird character sets you definitely want to make sure all of your unicode settings are correct which may take some trial and error and I've never entirely trusted mysql in this regard.<p>If you are paranoid you should have a separate job that automatically downloads and restores your backups after a period of time and runs a few test queries on the data. Of course the hard part is knowing what the results of these queries should be.<p>Of course the problem here is that this will chew up increasing amounts of your remote storage over time, so it depends if you can afford to delete backups of over a certain age.<p>You can also enable binary logging in mysqld and do incremental backups by writing the binary log to the remote host at certain intervals (I think this only works properly with InnoDB databases), though I have no practical experience doing this because frankly I've never needed to. Nightly dumps were always <i>good enough</i> so my boss wouldn't want me spending any more time on it.<p>That's the crux of the problem with working for a non tech company, most of the time once the solution is ""ok"" it's time to move onto something else so you never get a chance to really kick ass which is what you need to do to justify a high rate.<p>These are really commodity skills though, you could have figured all of this out yourself by reading a few blogs (that's basically all I did).

This post misses the point that tagging on and tagging off is a simple and relatively elegant solution to the problem posed by Caltrain charging by distance traveled.<p>But that's not the real problem with Clipper. The real problem with clipper is their <i>horrible customer service</i>. Here's my story with clipper - and I hardly think I'm alone.<p>I got my card about a year ago when I was going from San Jose to Redwood City once a week. On their web page I set up an 8-travel auto-pay system where I get 8 San Jose<->Redwood City tickets, and when I run out it buys a new set of 8 automatically.<p>This works great until one day I missed my stop and wound up in Gilroy (woops). What SHOULD have happened is that I tag off, pay full price for the ticket I actually traveled, and have the 8 ride ticket refunded. If the card 'balance' (non-ticket cash on the card) goes below $0 (or, for them, $1.25 for reasons I don't understand) then it debits my account for the remaining balance.<p>Instead what happened was my card went 'negative', and they <i>shut down the card</i> until I went to a Walgreens (?!) to pay the remainder of the balance. I was cautioned that paying online could take 1 to 2 weeks to clear the card. Where in the heck did Walgreens come in to the picture? By the way, despite having a banner outside advertising Clipper cards, my Walgreens had <i>no idea</i> what I was talking about. They had to call the GM to call the Clipper people to figure out what was going on.<p>Fast forward, and now I'm commuting between Millbrae and San Francisco via Caltrain again. I just started at this company and they pay for Caltrain, so I link my Employee benefits clipper system to my clipper card  - a process they made surprisingly simple which unsurprisingly completely F'ed up everything.<p>All of a sudden I can no longer add funds via my regular portal and have to go through the company portal - and get this, though I bought my employee-benefit-purchased monthly pass on Sept 4th, that was <i>too late for September</i>. So I had to go to - you guessed it - Walgreens to buy a monthly pass with cash for the card that could no longer be used online.<p>I'm hoping that it will work again in October... we will see.",1348263171

If you want to take any of these and run feel free, if you'd like to talk more about any my email is in my profile:<p>-A dating app that more closely mimics real-world dating by bringing spontaneous discovery and subtle-interactions into play. Traditional dating apps require you to a) know what you want and b) know how to find that in a text-based profile. That's not how the real world works. In real life dating you either meet through a third party (friend, roommate, classmate) or you randomly meet this person in a bar, library, etc (serendipity). In the latter case you choose to interact or not based solely on a) attractiveness and b) very basic personal information (age, general personality, intelligence). This app would try to closely mimic that form of meeting. It would also control a major pain point with current dating apps where men send out hundreds of messages without hearing back and women tend to get buried in a sea of copy and paste messages. It would do this by first requiring the female (in hetero users) to indicate interest in the male (real life: raised eyebrow/come hither look). Men can say they are interested in a girl (real life: buy her a drink) but they cannot interact with them any further until the woman says she is interested. The idea would be to start this in colleges where the majority of users are of similar demographics and actively seeking casual dates/hookups.<p>-an online marketplace for premium artisan greeting cards. i've always thought there was a market for the $10-$20 greeting card as long as you can really bring something people want. You see it with Hallmark trying out fresh ink and with the rise of Papyrus. The idea is that you can find plenty of very good artists who are looking for a way to pad their income. Personally I'm family friends with a good number of cartoonists but a look in any liberal arts university could surely uncover 5-10 quality artists. So the idea would be to seed the site with numbered, limited runs of the best of these artists greeting cards. You would need to find a quality printer and make sure your packaging is worthwhile but if you could seed the site initially with 10-20 new/unique quality greeting cards it could turn into it's own machine. Especially if you allow artists outside those you ""invited"" initially to submit their entries and have the top 5-10 make it to print each month/quarter. After allowing for printing and shipping costs you could give the artists 60% and take 40% of the proceeds. If done right this could be a place for artists to get started/make extra money.<p>-and iphone app built to be a ""personal assistants assistant"". An app that can take a persons calendar (google, outlook, ios), travel plans (tripit), address book, etc and make common tasks for a personal assistant much easier to do.<p>-a site/app that makes it easier to find a workout partner. it's been shown that people work out harder and more consistently when they have a workout partner but finding one (especially in urban areas) is incredibly difficult.",1348262857

So recruiters have the short-term incentive of convincing candidates to take jobs, and not necessarily to do what is right for their career.<p>Long term requires recruiters to be fully ethical or lose credibility.

I'm from CircleCi (hosted continuous integration - <a href=""https://circleci.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://circleci.com</a>) and this is really to help people like us out.<p>The problem this solves is that you need credentials to clone a git repo from GitHub. That's easy: you can add an SSH ""deploy"" key to the repo.<p>BUT, dependency management tools (like bundler, pip and npm) allow you specify private repositories in your Gemfile/requirements.txt/package.json file. If you use a deploy key, you won't have access to those repositories and your CI wil fail. This isn't a problem you face as a developer, because you have an SSH key on your machine valid for all your GitHub repositories, this only affects your CI server.<p>So now a 3rd-party hosted CI server can use an Oauth token - something we already have - to download any repository you have access to.<p>There were already some ways of doing this - we could have added an SSH key for your user. But this is easier, and you don't get a notification saying ""Circle has added an SSH key to your account"", which panics people. This is also more convenient in a couple of other ways which I won't get into.<p>But there is one final problem, and it's a big one: your CI server adds this key to the machine before it checks code out. Since you can run arbitrary code in the CI server, you could possibly steal the OAuth key, and act as the user. Uh-oh! You can try and prevent this, but it's a bit tricky and error-prone.<p>So what Circle does instead is make you explicitly opt-in to a user key. If you need to access multiple repos, we'll detect it, and tell you how to explicitly opt-in. This means you'll also get a notification saying ""Circle has added an SSH key to your account"" which is good in our opinion. Then we don't use that key for public repos, and only use it when _you_ are the pusher (your teammates will use their own key). We're also making that key passworded, which you can't do with OAuth.<p>That still isn't good enough for everyone. Some people prefer to specify a user to run all their tests, and that user has restricted permissions using GitHub's team management tool. This is great, and something we explicitly support as the most secure.<p>So I think this is great if you're using your own CI server and trust everyone who can commit code to it. For 3rd-party CI servers like Circle, I feel what we're doing is safer. Feedback welcome.<p>Finally, I don't want this to appear negative. The problem that I raised above is one that GitHub is aware of, and one they are solving. I can't say how they're solving it, but I know that it does indeed solve it. I believe this is step one, and a great move in the right direction.",1348262265

It doesn't make any sense to me. Out of the 3.5 billion years that the planet has sustained life, animals (first sponges, then cnidaria, etc.) have only been around for 630 million. Evolution didn't happen according to some goal; organisms evolved to suit their habitats.<p>So saying that plants/animals wouldn't exist on a planet significantly hotter than ours is really strange to say - they'd have no -reason- to. Because the evolutionary tree on that planet would be completely different from ours, the organisms' forms and internal structures will be very different in many ways. The same things won't have happened in their evolutionary history.<p>And of course, life would be adapted to the planet itself. You might say, ""Enzymes don't function at those temperatures."" Well, the life on hotter planets will have evolved to use different enzymes that -do- work at those temperatures.",1348262253

Soap scarcity was a quite common phenomenon until very recently, historically speaking.

I'll try to follow what you've said and respond as I go.<p><pre><code>  > In this first set, I do not have a decimal point anywhere.\n</code></pre>\nOK, fine.  But then you talked about flipping them around to come after the decimal point.  When you do that you have only those strings that only have a finite number of 1s in them.<p><pre><code>  > As far as representing it as a string, I may still start\n  > from the right and work towards the left.\n</code></pre>\nYes you can, but that's not what people do when talking about Cantor and diagonalisation, so it's now completely unclear what you're talking about.<p>However, you start with finite strings of 0s and 1s, basically the non-negative whole numbers, represented as binary strings. Note that these are all finite, and the non-zero parts are still finite, even if you prepend an infinite number of 0s.<p><pre><code>  > Stating the above for the decimal case, let n=1 be the\n  > place right after the decimal, n=2 to the right of it, and\n  > so on.\n</code></pre>\nSee, now you're talking about stuff after the decimal point.  I'll continue ...<p><pre><code>  > Now for place n=1, the both zero and one are covered\n  > (first two cases below).\n</code></pre>\nBut for diagonalisation that's irrelevant.  We only ask what is the first digit of the first number.<p><pre><code>  > For n=2 place, again both zero and one are covered for\n  > all possible combinations above for n=1 place\n</code></pre>\nAgain, irrelevant.  We only ask what is the 2nd digit of the 2nd number.<p><pre><code>  > 0.000000000000...\n  > 0.100000000000...\n  > 0.010000000000...\n  > 0.110000000000...\n  > 0.001000000000...\n  > 0.101000000000...\n</code></pre>\nSo here if we construct the diagonal of this sequence as you've listed it we have 0.00000... Let me highlight the diagonal for you from this quoted section:<p><pre><code>  > 0.0xxxxxxxxxxx...\n  > 0.x0xxxxxxxxxx...\n  > 0.xx0xxxxxxxxx...\n  > 0.xxx0xxxxxxxx...\n  > 0.xxxx0xxxxxxx...\n  > 0.xxxxx0xxxxxx...\n</code></pre>\nIf we now flip this we get 0.11111....<p>Now observe that all of the strings you have contain only a finite number of 1s.  That means that 0.11111... is not in your sequence.<p><pre><code>  > Using the mathematical induction argument,\n</code></pre>\nYou haven't made an induction argument.<p><pre><code>  > ... all combinations are covered.\n</code></pre>\nFor each place, both possibilities are eventually covered.  but for each sequence that you give, it is eventually all zeros.<p><pre><code>  > This must include 0.1111111111... \n</code></pre>\nNo, it doesn't.<p><pre><code>  > It sits exactly where (simple) infinity sits in\n  > the enumerable set {0, 1, 2, 3, ... }\n</code></pre>\nInfinity does not fit in that set, and 0.1111... is not in your defined set of numbers.",1348261533

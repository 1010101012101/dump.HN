It doesn&#x27;t matter how effective it is, that&#x27;s not a life you want to be living.<p>What makes you feel better about your daily life will depend on your temperament.  The author of this blog post found that GTD resulted in his feeling like he had a never-ending river of stress ahead of him.  GTD failed for him.<p>Another example where GTD fails is for anyone who is doing sustained creative work.  As Paul Graham describes in <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html</a>, it is very important for those people to have large blocks of time set aside for focused work.  GTD&#x27;s focus on breaking things into simple tasks whose execution is routine is the antithesis of how work needs to be organized for a maker.<p>That said, GTD is life-changing for many people.

10768424,comment,10765148,10768262,0,0,jcrites,,,"A person looking to understand &quot;What is REST? What is a RESTful application?&quot; would be well-served by considering <i>websites</i> rather than web services.<p>Facebook, Amazon, and Hacker News are good examples of RESTful applications. You can enter them through their website roots with no prior knowledge beyond standard web media types like HTML/CSS. The site roots display some information, expose some functionality like search, and link to pages with more capabilities like to create an account. The search function is expressed as an HTML form, and when the user submits their search, the HTML spec tells the browser to navigate to a new URL composed from the search form fields. The search result page displays a list of hyperlinks to other resources, such as products on Amazon or people on Facebook. Navigating to those pages lets you discover information and hyperlinks to other resources such as a person&#x27;s photos, related products, etc.<p>The way a browser navigates through a website by following links is the classic example of a RESTful application, and is the meaning of &quot;hypermedia as the engine of application state&quot;. Fielding also wrote a blog post clarifying REST and its constraints: <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow"">http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hyperte...</a><p>> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience. A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server). A REST API should never have “typed” resources that are significant to the client. Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type<p>Some confusion about REST seems to stem from misguided attempts to apply REST to scenarios for which it&#x27;s not a good fit - scenarios where there is by necessity tight coupling in the form of mutual knowledge of specific data types and operations. Other confusion about the term &quot;REST&quot; comes from applying subset of its principles, resulting in a popular label that refers to a large spectrum of architectural styles. The Richardson Maturity Model helps organize these functionality subsets into levels that can be named and considered separately - services termed REST are sometimes level 1 or 2 in the Richardson model.<p><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.htm...</a>",1450648489

Research suggests that users only recognise a very limited set of icons in an application, and where there are extensive toolbars full of different icons, it is often the position that the user is recognising more than the icon itself. Thus reorganising things like toolbars can have a profound negative effect on usability, and it seems likely (though I&#x27;m speculating now) that this would be much worse than something like reordering text items in a menu.",1450648318

Some values are multiple machine words, pushed onto the stack.<p>Some of these (such as double-words) have language-defined representations. (They&#x27;re always stored with the low word at the lower address, regardless of your machine endianness or, as far as I can tell, whether your stack is growing up or down. <i>Which means that on some platforms the low word is pushed first, and on others the high word first.</i> This shouldn&#x27;t matter, because you should be using the dword words to manipulate them, except that it&#x27;s common practice to assemble and disassemble dwords manually.)<p>Some have implementation-defined implementation-defined representations. For example, the various bits of state that the control flow words push onto the return stack. You don&#x27;t know how big any of these are, so accessing the return stack from inside loops is basically impossible.<p>And some are just weird. Floating-point numbers live on their own stack. Except not necessarily; the implementation is allowed to store them on the data stack. So you can&#x27;t use NIP TUCK OVER PICK etc because you don&#x27;t know the layout of your stack.<p>Basically, at every point, you have to know the type of the values on your stack so you can pick the right word (DROP vs 2DROP vs FDROP) to operate on the stack... and if you get it wrong, you get stack corruption and horrible, hard-to-debug crashes.<p>tl;dr: Forth is typed.

I know that FORTH is more compact than C, and the code decrease in size might be reasonable in some cases, but the reasons you give are insane! come on!<p>Elaborate Syntax: Your syntax is simple, C&#x27;s is less simple. If you want elaborate, look at PERL or Haskell.\nRedundancy and Confusing Types: Fair enough, but the types have to be the ones they are because C&#x27;s supposed to be close to the metal. Therefore, you need specific bit sized types. It could be better than it is, though.<p>Strong typing causes errors: Um. Take that up with the angry Haskellers lining up behind you. I&#x27;ll just duck off this way... Honestly, C&#x27;s type system is pretty awful, but that&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s strongly typed.<p>Infix:...Yeah, pretty much, but the mainstream won&#x27;t except anything else.<p>Parens: Tell that to the lispers. Parens shine for syntax parsing, and the incredibly common editor support makes it even nicer than Python for editing. \nUnclear how source will be translated: Well, I guess, but more so than anything higher up the stack, like, just to pick a random example, most modern FORTH implementations.\nSubroutine calls are expensive: Compared to what? 1 mov or push instruction for for each arg, and than a call instruction, at least on x86. Most other processor architectures seem to have similar things going. Those are all pretty fast.<p>Elaborate Compiler, Object Libraries: Yes, compared to FORTH, the compiler is elaborate, but that isn&#x27;t why object libraries are distributed, seeing as there&#x27;s a C compiler for every system under the sun. And distributing object libraries isn&#x27;t exactly hard.<p>Lots and lots of files: Yeah, this sucks. But every other system is going to have the same problem, and a proper module system that associates functions to files is really the only way to fix it, aside from oddly specific introspection utilities. Most other languages, say, for example, FORTH, don&#x27;t have this, AFAIK.<p>Indentation as an indication of nesting: And you suggest counting braces as an alternative? or just not having nesting? Because most languages, say, for instance, FORTH, have nesting.<p>No Docs: In BAD C code, this is true. As in bad code in any language, like, for instance, FORTH, as any language designer knows that the language cannot make bad programmers good.<p>Names are Hyphenated: &quot;I think hyphens suck&quot; isn&#x27;t a problem with the language, it&#x27;s just a personal preference.\nConstants are named: With my passing familiarity with FORTH, I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s on about here. Could somebody explain, so I can see if I agree?<p>Preoccupation with Contingencies: Because everybody loves leaky abstractions that fail at critical moments for ill-defined reasons.<p>Conditional Compilation: This feature sucks. It really does. The problem is, I don&#x27;t see what else they could have done. So my response here is, Do you have any better way to do cross platform compatibility? Because I would honestly love to see it. I&#x27;m serious.<p>Hooks: Ahhh, I see. You&#x27;re from the beautiful-diamond camp of software design. I can recognize you guys by your catchy slogan, &quot;Don&#x27;t Design With The Future In Mind.&quot;\nProgrammers best interest to exaggerate complexity: No language can fix this. It&#x27;s impossible, because this is a social pressure.<p>Portability: Yeah, basically.<p>Maybe I haven&#x27;t seen enough C. Maybe I haven&#x27;t seen enough FORTH. Maybe I just can&#x27;t get into Chuck&#x27;s mindset here. But his claims just seem insane.<p>EDIT: I read some more off of Chuck&#x27;s pages, he seems to be thinking more in terms of embedded architectures and single purpose code.

Dereferencing NULL is a pretty classic case where anything can happen once you do it. &quot;Calling launch_missiles even though you don&#x27;t want it to happen&quot; is a subset of &quot;anything,&quot; of course.<p>Consider what happens if you rearrange that example a bit, though. Let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s more like this:<p><pre><code>    int computation(int *ptr_a, int *ptr_b) {\n        if(ptr_a == NULL && ptr_b == NULL) return 0;\n        if(ptr_a == NULL) return val_b;\n        if(ptr_b == NULL) return val_a;\n        launch_missiles(); /* OK to put this here? */\n        return ...something with val_a and val_b...;\n    }\n\n    int otherComputation(int *ptr_a, int *ptr_b) {\n        int val_a = *ptr_a, val_b = *ptr_b;\n        int intermediate = computation(ptr_a, ptr_b);\n        return ...something with val_a, val_b, and intermediate....;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen you call otherComputation in a tight loop. Should the compiler elide the NULL checks here, if computation gets inlined? otherComputation clearly requires that its parameters are non-NULL, so it should be fine to remove the checks. Failing to do so would be pretty annoying. It&#x27;s clear that the inputs are constrained, and while you could fix it by factoring out the common code so that the NULL checks are explicitly optional, it would be best if the optimizer can handle it and not require us to rearrange our code to make it happy.<p>That&#x27;s really what I&#x27;m getting at. There are clear examples where it&#x27;s bad to assume undefined behavior cannot happen and optimize away checks. But there are also clear examples where it&#x27;s exactly what you want to do. Can the optimizer reliably distinguish between these cases?<p>I think the best answer is to have tools available like the undefined behavior sanitizer which can catch these problems at runtime. You want the optimizer to make your code as fast as it legally can. Trying to tone it down is going to be error-prone, and safety checks that can&#x27;t be counted on are dangerous. You might end up just moving the problem around: instead of code suddenly being optimized out because the compiler proved it can&#x27;t run without invoking undefined behavior, you&#x27;ll have code suddenly being optimized out because something changed that made the compiler think you intended it. By checking at runtime, you recast the problem from &quot;does the programmer intend to pass in values which will result in undefined behavior?&quot; to &quot;does this code <i>actually get called</i> with such values?&quot; That&#x27;s way easier to check, should have zero false positives, and should have as few false negatives with good test coverage.",1450647588

10768378,comment,10768020,10768020,0,0,dsacco,,,"Let me give you some advice, from the perspective of someone who runs a successful security firm.<p>Have you worked as a consultant at one of the larger firms, like Optiv, Bishop Fox or NCC Group? What professional experience do you have? Have you found serious vulnerabilities and published them? Any bug bounties?<p>Without a network to draw on it is very difficult to start your own practice. You need referrals, introductions and people to vouch for you. Failing that, you need to be &quot;infosec famous&quot; or very close to it (this is why so many people publish for publicity in the security world).<p>My recommendation is that you join an established firm if you really have the technical skills. If you&#x27;ve already been at a serious firm for two or three years or so then you&#x27;ll understand the business processes inherent to running a successful consultancy. Without understanding how <i>that</i> works you won&#x27;t know how to leverage your skills and turn them into a reliable income on your own.<p>Forget certifications. You don&#x27;t need any to be successful if you can just demonstrate the ability to find vulnerabilities. The CISSP (as an example) can be helpful for a certain subset of clientele, but it&#x27;s not useful enough to pour your energy into instead of e.g. getting CVEs on your rèsumè and establishing a network.<p>Can you find every single vulnerability outlined in <i>The Web Application Hacker&#x27;s Handbook</i>? How about the trickier ones that crop up in Black Hat presentations? It&#x27;s not enough to be able to find CSRF or XSS in a bug bounty, you need to be reliable, consistent and thorough when working as a consultant. This is one of the reasons bug bounty participants are rarely qualified to join consultancies, even if they find vulnerabilities. They often lack the professional maturity to find more than a certain subset of vulnerabilities.<p>Your first few clients will be the most difficult. Here is a rough outline of what you can do to get a pipeline of work:<p>1. Join a reputable security consultancy and develop your skills. Polish them from &quot;I can find vulnerabilities&quot; to &quot;I can model a large software project for design flaws, implementation vulnerabilities and operational vulnerabilities, then thoroughly find everything&quot; (within reason, given a finite testing timeline). Your track record for finding vulnerabilities must go from &quot;more often than not&quot; to &quot;virtually always&quot; for each application put in front of you.<p>2. Do independent security research. Subscribe to security alerts from large vendors. When a CVE is issued, check it out, try to reproduce the issue and learn from it. Start finding vulnerabilities just like it in widely used software frameworks and libraries. Build up a track record and a personal brand of security formidibility.<p>3. If you have done #1 or #2 already, or once you have, then leave and start your own practice. You won&#x27;t be allowed to solicit your past employer&#x27;s clients, but you can leverage your network. Talk to past colleagues and coworkers and put yourself out there. Try to subcontract out to various security firms (it&#x27;s an open secret that most firms will do this if they have a surplus of work).<p>4. Aggressively pursue referrals for every single client you work with. Master the business side of running a consultancy. Consultants at large firms don&#x27;t earn as much as successful independent consultants or founders because their margin is spread thinner. Conversely, your own practice will not have salespeople or account managers. It will be you and you alone.<p>You must be able to communicate exceptionally well, maintain deadlines on your own, support a plethora of payment methods from clients (checks in mail, third parties, ACH transfers), survive under uncertain payment timelines (large clients love to languish accounts payable forever) and manage all your clients and sales pipelines on your own.<p>Your technical ability must be exceptional, yet it will only be half of your ability to make a good income.

And, yet precisely because of family roots and a rich social network and schools we never moved.<p>I worked for Boston firms for several years without moving there. I negotiated the remote work option and while it preserved my family goals ... when the recession of 2008 hit hard and jobs got eliminated mine was one of the first on the chopping block even though I was sitting on a consistent set of promotions and raises. I am convinced that distance and diminished face time with key executives meant that it was easier to choose my job as one to eliminate.<p>I made these decisions to stay where I was geographically for family reasons and my wife&#x27;s career at the time wasn&#x27;t particularly germane because she had already quit work to spend some years FT focused on raising our children. If she had been more actively building her own career and had a really great job that would have just reinforced the decision to stay-put.<p>I don&#x27;t have any experience with Amazon as a workplace but I am sure you have read online discussions, news articles about their culture and asked around your circle. My own impression of Amazon would be that it would be a very risky thing to uproot your family to follow that job. At the very least I endorse your thought of spending 6 months to a full year to see whether it is a good fit prior to moving your family.<p>You and your wife also need a really honest heart-to-heart about her feelings about potentially giving up a &quot;great gig&quot; and the likelihood that she can find something comparable in Seattle.<p>Decision making under uncertainty is a hallmark of human life. Without knowing a lot more about your situation I can&#x27;t really offer more than empathy.",1450646577

That&#x27;s not how I use it.)<p>-I don&#x27;t split up projects in to Asana &#x27;Projects.&#x27; I make one Asana Project for each client that I work for and a separate one for &#x27;Personal&#x27;. I split up real life projects in to Headings with subtasks in the same Asana project. (All projects for Client A go in the Client A project.) This way I&#x27;m never trying to move tasks between projects.<p>-As tasks come up that I want to remember, I forward them to the email address for the correct Project (client). I usually change the subject line to be more descriptive of the task. This puts them at the top of the list for that client.<p>-In between tasks (usually every few hours while I&#x27;m working) I read over the list and categorize anything new that I&#x27;ve emailed in under the right heading. I also set the due-date to be the next time I want to work on that particular task.<p>-As I get started for the day on a certain client, I&#x27;ll look at the list for that client sorted by due date and try to cross off or reschedule everything for that day.<p>-Sometimes I&#x27;ll tag tasks with a name of the person I need to talk to or the location that something needs to be done. That way the next time I run in to JohnDoe I just say &#x27;oh hang on I had a few things to talk to you about&#x27; then tap tap tap to the JohnDoe tag in Asana.",1450646219

Such a definition would assume that multiple people know and agree on what would be the full extent of that understanding. The problem with REST is not the different <i>amount</i> of knowledge that people possess, but the different <i>ideas</i> that they have about REST. Which is another way to say that REST is not really a well defined protocol. (Have you seen similar vague posts titled &quot;What IMAP4 actually means&quot;?)<p>Because it is not a well defined protocol, you cannot use the same client library to access random REST APIs. You use/write one library to access Twitter&#x27;s REST and another to access Facebook&#x27;s REST.

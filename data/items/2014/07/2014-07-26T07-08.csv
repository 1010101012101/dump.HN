So it&#x27;s not really stealing the idea or the code, only the business model, which the OP apparently doesn&#x27;t want to pursue anyway.<p>A non Affero license (or MIT, BSD, Apache) would have shut him off from his code (I can&#x27;t decide if those using those licenses are masochists or just extremely kind).

That&#x27;s 40&#x27;000 easily avoidable deaths each year - all they take is some inconvenience from everyone and a bit of investment in public transport infrastructure, in exchange for a dozen 9/11&#x27;s worth of terrorism avoided every single year. As a bonus, the US&#x27;s oil consumption would plummet and it would almost instantly achieve any environmental targets it can dream of.<p>What&#x27;s that - you still want the freedom to drive? Even though it involves a fairly significant (0.01%) risk of dying because of things not under your control? Well, some people want the freedom to not be monitored all the time, even though it involves a much smaller than 0.01% risk of dying because of a terrorist attack. And all people should, and would, if terrorism didn&#x27;t capture the imagination so vividly.",1406361354

That is precisely what they&#x27;re doing here, except on a much larger scale than the post office could ever fathom.<p>It is shocking to compare this to the past. I&#x27;ve just finished reading &quot;Team of Rivals&quot;, a biography of Lincoln, and the amount of deeply sensitive stuff that these high-level politicians shared in personal letters to their loved ones and colleagues is astonishing. No politician today would ever put such stuff in writing - if it got into the wrong hands, it could cause incalculable damage to their reputations, relationships, etc. Those guys were being entirely honest in hand-written letters that were delivered days away in different states by a very rudimentary postal system. They clearly had complete trust in the sanctity of the privacy of their letters.<p>This level of trust in the US government (or any, in fact) is pretty much unthinkable today.

8089193,comment,8084456,8089088,6,0,shutupalready,,,"Speaking of nuclear-powered aircraft, care to guess who holds the patent on that?<p>It&#x27;s none other than Richard Feynman, as related in this hilarious passage from his famous biography:<p>--- quote ---<p>One time when I happened to be home, the telephone rings: it&#x27;s LONG DISTANCE, from California. In those days, a long distance call meant it was something very important, especially a long distance call from this marvelous place, California, a million miles away.<p>The guy on the other end says, &quot;Is this Professor Feynman, of Cornell University?&quot;<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right.&quot;<p>&quot;This is Mr. So-and-so from the Such-and-such Aircraft Company.&quot; It was one of the big airplane companies in California, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t remember which one. The guy continues: &quot;We&#x27;re planning to start a laboratory on nuclear-propelled rocket airplanes. It will have an annual budget of so-and-so-many million dollars . . .&quot; Big numbers.<p>I said, &quot;Just a moment, sir; I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;re telling me all this.&quot;<p>&quot;Just let me speak to you,&quot; he says; &quot;just let me explain everything. Please let me do it my way.&quot; So he goes on a little more, and says how many people are going to be in the laboratory, so-and-so-many people at this level, and so-and-so many Ph.D&#x27;s at that level . . .<p>&quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; I say, &quot;but I think you have the wrong fella.&quot;<p>&quot;Am I talking to Richard Feynman, Richard <i>P.</i> Feynman?&quot;<p>&quot;Yes, but you&#x27;re..<p>&quot;Would you please let me present what I have to say, sir, and then we&#x27;ll discuss it.&quot;<p>&quot;All right!&quot; I sit down and sort of close my eyes to listen to all this stuff, all these details about this big project, and I still haven&#x27;t the slightest\nidea why he&#x27;s giving me all this information.<p>Finally, when he&#x27;s all finished, he says, &quot;I&#x27;m telling you about our plans because we want to know if you would like to be the director of the laboratory.&quot;<p>&quot;Have you really got the right fella?&quot; I say. &quot;I&#x27;m a professor of theoretical physics. I&#x27;m not a rocket engineer, or an airplane engineer, or anything like that.&quot;<p>&quot;We&#x27;re sure we have the right fellow.&#x27;<p>&quot;Where did you get my name then? Why did you decide to call me?&quot;<p>&quot;Sir, your name is on the patent for nuclear-powered, rocket-propelled airplanes.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; I said, and I realized why my name was on the patent, and I&#x27;ll have to tell you the story. I told the man, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I would like to continue as a professor at Cornell University.&quot;<p>What had happened was, during the war, at Los Alamos, there was a very nice fella in charge of the patent office for the government, named Captain Smith. Smith sent around a notice to everybody that said something like, &quot;We in the patent office would like to patent every idea you have\nfor the United States government, for which you are working now. Any idea you have on nuclear energy or its application that you may think everybody knows about, everybody doesn&#x27;t know about: Just come to my office and tell me the idea.&quot;<p>I see Smith at lunch, and as we&#x27;re walking back to the technical area, I say to him, &quot;That note you sent around: That&#x27;s kind of crazy to have us come in and tell you every idea.&quot;<p>We discussed it back and forth--by this time we&#x27;re in his office--and I say, &quot;There are so many ideas about nuclear energy that are so perfectly obvious, that I&#x27;d be here all day telling you stuff.&quot;<p>&quot;LIKE WHAT?&quot;<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27; to it!&quot; I say. &quot;Example: nuclear reactor . . . under water. . water goes in . . . steam goes out the other side . . . Pshshshsht--it&#x27;s a submarine. Or: nuclear reactor . . . air comes rushing in the front. . . heated up by nuclear reaction . . . out the back it goes . . . Boom! Through the air--it&#x27;s an airplane. Or: nuclear reactor . . you have hydrogen go through the thing . . . Zoom!--it&#x27;s a rocket. Or: nuclear reactor . . . only instead of using\nordinary uranium, you use enriched uranium with beryllium oxide at high temperature to make it more efficient . . . It&#x27;s an electrical power plant. There&#x27;s a million ideas!&quot; I said, as I went out the door.<p>Nothing happened.<p>About three months later, Smith calls me in the office and says, &quot;Feynman, the submarine has already been taken. But the other three are yours.&quot;<p>So when the guys at the airplane company in California are planning their laboratory, and try to find out who&#x27;s an expert in rocket-propelled whatnots, there&#x27;s nothing to it: They look at who&#x27;s got the patent on it!",1406360810

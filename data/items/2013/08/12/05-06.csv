It is like saying a compiler is smarter than a programmer, because its design incorporates tricks the human may not know. (The bacteria being &quot;designed&quot; by the trial-and-error process of natural selection, rather than an intelligent entity, of course.)",1376287194

6197832,comment,6197005,6197005,1,0,UntitledNo4,,,"In my opinion Fab.com is the next step in the evolution from the daily deal websites. The main difference is that currently it focuses on delivered goods while daily deals were about services in your area, but I think their basic hypothesis is that people love deals and will spend money in things they didn&#x27;t consider buying just because the price is good. \nAnother difference which I noticed is that unlike most daily deals websites, theirs are not time-limit based, but rather quantity-limit, which I guess works better for the suppliers since there cannot be a situation where they have to honour more transactions than they could have foreseen. \nAs a customer, I also noticed two main operating models which I find interesting. The first is where Fab.com have the items in stock and the other is that the items are delivered to fab only after you have made the purchase, and sometimes within a week of ordering, which might mean that they are waiting to make a bulk shipment from the supplier, and perhaps don&#x27;t have to pay for the goods until they have orders.\nAnother interesting feature they have is they give you 20 minutes to checkout. This, I guess serves two purposes, the first is giving the customer a sense of urgency, a &quot;buy it now or lose it&quot; feeling, and the second is that this prevents blocking people from buying the product just by having it in your basket (since quantity is limited).<p>There are already quite a few clones which I have seen seen. One is monoqi.com, but I have seen others (just don&#x27;t remember their names).",1376286058

You could essentially encrypt the entire header block if you&#x27;re changing the protocols. What actually delivers the email is the &#x27;RCPT TO&#x27; command on the SMTP transaction.<p>At the moment, SMTP requires that you also give it a &#x27;MAIL FROM&#x27; command that tells who the sender is. Most servers also require a HELO that identifies the sending server, but you can basically get away with putting anything in there.<p>But now you&#x27;re left with an authorization problem.<p>Currently the combination of these three fields is what determines whether an SMTP server will accept the message for delivery or relay. If all you get is the &#x27;RCPT TO&#x27; command, then you have no idea who&#x27;s sending the message until it&#x27;s decoded.<p>This puts the authorization task on to the recipient&#x27;s computer. So the 90% of all email that&#x27;s spam will now need to be parsed on the desktop.<p>One solution here would be to include another section above the encrypted email header+body that is the authorization block. Now the recipient&#x27;s server holds then entire encrypted message using the RCPT TO as the destination. The recipient downloads a list of auth-blocks addressed to them and issues back a DENY if they don&#x27;t want the message.<p>The authorization block would identify the sender who has signed their identity in a publicly identifiable way. BAM! There goes spam.<p>Unfortunately the BIGGEST problem in all this is Microsoft. They could have added simple-to-set-up PGP to Outlook years back.

6197732,comment,6196334,6196334,1,0,artagnon,,,"For a theory to be good science, it must fit a very large number of observations and not contradict any a single one. Here&#x27;s my attempt.<p>We must get a tight definition of consciousness to begin with. Are animals conscious as well (and to what degree)? What about amoeba and plants? If you classify &quot;living&quot; things as conscious, and &quot;dead&quot; things as unconscious, what is your definition of &quot;life&quot;? In their work, various people (notably, Metzinger) have isolated certain characteristics that make up various degrees of consciousness.<p>The &quot;conscious experience&quot; is a product of evolution: clearly, &quot;self-aware decision makers&quot; have better chances of survival than &quot;hard-coded automatons&quot;. In recent evolution, the part that has changed most significantly is the neocortex. Scientifically speaking, it&#x27;s very easy to figure out what is responsible for a high degree of consciousness: removing neocortex consistently leads to a lower degree of consciousness => the neocortex is responsible for a large part. Dissect, stick electrodes, and get unbiased data: then do a best fit.<p>Quantum mechanics is quite misunderstood: if you separate out the observer from what is being observed, it looks like humans are operating the universe (because their &quot;observation&quot; causes &quot;collapse&quot;, right?). Highly egotistical and inelegant. If you exclude M-theory (because it&#x27;s not able to make verifiable real-world predictions), a lot of people subscribe to quantum decoherence as an alternative to the classical Copenhagen interpretation.<p>On conscious computer programs. Essentially, I think of consciousness as a higher degree of interaction with its surroundings (it &quot;learns&quot; from its surroundings and adapts more quickly than it would normally take for natural selection to pick a genetic mutation). Aren&#x27;t we just describing computer programs that interact with humans via a high-level language?",1376283705

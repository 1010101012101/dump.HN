You can audit a cash business but with no receipts whole transactions never happened or have a paper trail.<p>I'm not condoning tax avoidance but remember most of the people on HN either earn six figures a year, will do in a few years and/or building startups that might be worth $millions.<p>This guy is making $15-30/hr, doing part-manual labor and has 4 kids and a wife to feed.<p>I guess it's a moral judgement but I feel less concerned if he was to not run all of his cash payments through his books compared to bankers and millionaires who put large amounts of money offshore to avoid tax.",1327618754

There is no magic trick to solve it no matter how much money you throw at the problem.<p>Show me the city in the world with the worst traffic and I'll show you the city with the highest buildings.<p>Only accepting that fact we can start planning better cities. Also worth considering, giving telecommute a high priority, since most of the office work done in these big cities can be easily done from home.<p>Suburban sprawl becomes a problem only when those millions of  people have to drive downtown to work clogging the driveways, but traffic is not an issue in suburban areas per se, lower urban density wins again.",1327618744

Your experience?",,"GetViable has been working within the York Butter Factory co-working environment with 20 other high-potential, seed-stage companies to understand how best to leverage our crowd-source and offshore experience to build and accelerate the growth of very early stage ideas. At this stage our model is highly effective in keeping our clients focussed on getting their product out the door with the least friction and at an affordable price point.
This model particularly helps:
the business founder, without the benefit of a tech co-founder, to test their ideas,
attracting tech co-founders once the product is live ,
attracting funding by demonstrating a viable, working idea.<p>Have you had experience using crowd sourcing or offshoring to build more faster? We'd love to hear from you - good or bad ;-)<p>Full article here - http://wp.me/p20yIF-6D",1327618557

You should focus on that and just that. If you feel like you have a lot of  free time on your hands try knocking on 1-5 pain management doctors clinic. See how you do there. If you manage to customize their workflows and menus for pain management, move to 1-5 MDs obesity clinics, and so on.

It has 2,612,024 mln medical concepts and counting. Many diseases are still poorly covered. Any time you talk with a specialist in a hospital he/she will need those terms in their documentation. Every disease has different workflow and different vocabulary. If a hospital thinks about adopting a new EMR, they will send ~100 their own IT people to EPIC/GE HQ to have them trained how to configure their system. Then, those ~100 IT people will work with ~1000 MD to have progress notes, flowsheets, and what have you configured to everyones liking. This is SO MUCH work and huge investment that has to have 0.0001% risk for the hospital and for the patients. Keep in mind that if patient dies and there are lacks in documentations someone will have to pay ... a lot.<p>I'm sure that some day you will have ~1k engineers and ~2k support team, each encumbered with basic medical knowledge and patient workflows.

The reason someone with 8 years experience can spot them almost instantly is because they have seen thousands of mutations of database, Toolkit, UI and self inflicted bugs, they learn over time to spot the fingerprints, that provide the trail to investigate. I think it is peculiar that we as an industry put juniors on bug hunting as some of the first assignments, when it has been noted by many that debugging is one of the most difficult and frustrating aspects of development.

Yes having notes, referencing materials, etc in the real world is being prepared. BUT, even in the real world, there's a reasonable expectation that you'll store and retrieve as much of that information as possible in and from your own memory. For example, I'm a pretty adept with python. I occasionally need to look at the standard library reference; yet, I try to commit as much as I can to memory. If I didn't, I would spend the majority of my time searching instead of doing. It goes without saying that a person who knows something off the top of his or her head is more efficient than someone who doesn't. You're correct that in the real world you'll rarely be in a situation where you don't have access to a reference of some kind.

Because my husband & I run a very similar business, and we understand what it's like.<p>Here's the thing about the comments on this article, here on HN: of the people saying it was a mistake, that the article was misleading, etc, etc: How many of them have a profitable business with a team of any size, and multiple products?<p>That's the hidden problem with HN: with a few notable exceptions, everybody here is an Monday morning quarterback.<p>There is NOTHING more draining than to keep a product running ""because it's just profitable enough."" Or worse, because you feel guilty about shutting it down, because you feel like you're going to let down your customers.<p>There's nothing more divisive than a redheaded stepchild product.<p>There's nothing more wasteful than a distraction to you & your team.<p>Running 2 products is not simply double the work than running 1. Running 3 products is not simply 50% more than running 2.<p>When one runs a successful business oneself, one knows this implicitly.<p>But when you haven't, then you are likely to look at this kind of story and go ""WTF? They just threw away $75k/year? But they could have spent 1 day a week on fixing it and making it more profitable! They could have hired a part-time designer!""<p>But this is just a lament wrapped up in logical, impartial language - but still a lament, which is really saying ""WTF? I could use $75k/year! How could they possibly throw that away? WASTEFUL. SHAMEFUL.""<p>Which is, really, totally understandable. Until you run a business of this scale, it's hard to imagine how $75k/yr in profit could be a millstone around your neck instead of something to celebrate. However, that does not good business advice make, and one must always consider the source & experience of the person dispensing it.",1327616253

His product, www.minomonsters.com, has evolved from a nearly-finished Facebook game into beautifully designed and highly engaging iPhone app.<p>2.) Josh is now an alien (with extraordinary ability) due to his O1 visa.<p>3.) He has grown the business from a one-man-band hiring freelancers into a proper company with an office and staff.<p>4.) His network has expanded exponentially.<p>5.) He has found a truly great cofounder who makes him raise his game.<p>6.) He has ridden the emotional roller-coaster of fund-raising on his own and that has transformed him into an even better businessman.<p>7.) The process has taught him the art of focussing on one huge, seemingly-insurmountable goal. He has sacrificed a lot but gained even more.<p>8.) Despite his incredible work-ethic and dedication to his startup, one thing hasn't changed. He is still a great friend and always makes time for those he cares about.<p>I met Josh about 4 years ago.

I finished school 3 mos ago and have been working for a company as a Jr. Dev for almost 9 months.  As far as the company expectation I'm meeting my deadlines and everyone likes me.  Where I struggle is I feel like I'm not even close to contributing as much a my co-workers(although they have all been coding 8+ yrs me 3mos +school which I did learn nothing barely functional).  I feel like I spend much time on problems that it might only take another co-worker 20 mins and takes me 2 hrs to figure out and fix.  I love programming so much that things like this is making me depressed.  Prior to my education I had no programming experience but a few IT gigs which no programming was used.  Question? Is it normal to feel this way as a newbie or Am I being hard on myself?  Also I think sometimes the type of software has a peculiar type of business logic which is not easy nor fond.  Sometimes I think learning all this business logic is making me discouraged because I'm not really into it..(So this makes programming the logic and understanding it hard.)    The weird part is everyone seems to be okay with my work but I don't..<p>My solution to get out of funk:<p>Either take another gig that is Associate Programmer somewhere else with different product and client.<p>Go into a hybrid helddesk or network analyst role that includes programming.<p>Start some small home projects in the type of technology we use at work and post them on Github.(To grow and learn as well as be inspired)<p>Totally leave development and do something else..(program on side as hobby)",1327615376

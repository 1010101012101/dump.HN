529791,comment,529337,529708,0,0,harpastum,,,"I admit there is some similarity there, and it might be because I didn't fully explain myself, but I would argue that it's neither a perfect conception nor iterative development that creates true greatness, but repetitive rebirth. When you simply build on the past, you aren't considering its true intentions. How many laws are there in the US that are simply reactions to British rule (i.e. safety from the quartering of troops)? Should those laws be held in as high esteem as those laws that are truly based on human rights? Descartes continues in <i>Discourse on Method</i>:<p><pre><code>    As for the opinions which up to that time I had embraced, I thought that I could not do better than 
    resolve at once to sweep them wholly away, that I might afterwards be in a position to admit either other
    more correct, or even perhaps the same when they had undergone the scrutiny of reason. I firmly believed
    that in this way I should much better succeed in the conduct of my life, than if I built only upon old 
    foundations, and leaned upon principles which, in my youth, I had taken upon trust.

First it is separated into 20 sections on the side, most of which I do not even use.  Another issue if I'm using linux with all the prerequesites I fail the browser check and it tells me to try Firefox3... which I'm using because of the lack of support for other operating systems I almost missed an assignment as it did not attach my document.<p>Another Issue that really bothers me is the grades, you cannot sort them in any way there is no relative dating just however the teacher enters it in and most don't really care how they enter it, at the very least I'd like to be able to see my total points or perhaps even a comparison between my grade and the average grade, something all my other classes give is averages of large assignments/tests.<p>The main thing I would like would be something like a simple editor as default and a html editor that actually accepts html code such as bold and paragraphs.<p>An interface that didn't use massive amounts of javascript to fetch each page would be awesome too but that might be asking a lot.<p>Id like sections that aren't in use such as calendar or announcements or data kind of things to be unavailable if the teacher has not posted anything in them.<p>Another good thing would be a way for teachers to change .doc into pages too many times have I seen bullets and numbered lists just copy pasted into a document to lose all formatting.<p>Thats a lot of what I hate but probably hard to do and not feasable.",1237873722

529779,comment,529552,529552,0,0,robotrout,,,"I'm skeptical.  To get meaningful energy transfer in a heat exchanger, you need time for the two material streams to be in thermal contact with each other.  This is done by either increasing the surface areas using some porous or tortuitous channel, or just making the channels really long.  In either case, it means you have significant pressure drop.<p>Now, a significant pressure drop in the incoming flow is bad enough, as I like a strong shower.  But more concerning, is the pressure drop in the drain, which is already only at atmospheric pressure.<p>I predict lots of plugged drains and showers that you're wading ankle deep in water.

In many cities you can't water your lawn, wash your car, fill your pool, etc, etc. Some smaller town and regions are already in total crisis.<p>When I mention the Murray-Darling Basin in my other comment - that's a big issue. The federal government basically had to step in and take over the control of water from the states. This might not sound like a lot, but it was a big deal, one of the biggest uses of federal muscle in Australia's history.<p>Even in the UK and New Zealand -- which you'd imagine as having a lot of water -- have issues with water infrastructure and population. I've heard the Bay Area is also facing the prospect of water restrictions... If you do a search on ""water restrictions"" it doesn't look like this issue is unique: <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=water+restrictions&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=water+restrictions&ie=utf...</a><p>Technologies such as desalination don't necessarily solve the issue. It's simply not economic or feasible in most parts of the world. Australia is already heavily invested in water saving technologies - low flow showerheads, low volume toilets, grey-water, rainwater tanks.<p>There are large areas of Australia that have had their ground water massively overused - causing massive issues with salination (in some places you literally have salt forming on the ground). The fresh water sources in these regions is totally collapsing.<p>Sorry to go on about it. But where I live, water is a real issue.

The people that have influence in the community are the folks that stick around.<p>We live in a very young-thinking age, anxious to throw out established wisdom and forge our own way. However, I fear that we are too eager to discount the <i>wisdom</i> in established wisdom. I'm not saying that we have to swallow it wholesale.

Or rather, we belong to a new one every two years, which amounts to the same thing.<p>We pay lip service to the ideas of helping our neighbors and building strong communities, but we have no idea what those words actually mean. We try to fulfill these ideals through national politics, but it's not the same thing as actually helping your neighbor, personally, in real life.<p>So sure, people need to rent and move around when they are young and finding their way.

They knew who was widowed and who had children overseas in Iraq and could use a nice meal with friends.

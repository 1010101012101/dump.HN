3900241,comment,3889512,3892851,1,0,Kadrith,,,"My experience has been very different however I work in a place that does care about the burden placed on people by compliance.  I am also heavily involved with compliance, drafting policies and the implementation of those policies.  When someone wants a new policy implemented I have a rule that they are the first ones I hold to the new policy.<p>One example was a change to the password complexity requirements for our organization (health care); since this was approved by senior leadership I changed the passwords for senior leadership first and did not allow any exceptions to the new policy.  This ensured that the people who initiated the policy and are in a position to change the policy are the first ones impacted by it.  If something was horribly wrong I would only change the policy or provide an exception if anyone who met the same criteria was also to be given the exception.  If the exception is by job title or position I would require that they explicitly put that in the policy; that has never been requested though.<p>When there is a process to communicate issues and a culture that actually cares, compliance isn't as bad.  For example we instituted a stricter change management process about a year ago.<p>We got people together to figure out what we thought a good balance was between the compliance needs, operational needs and the problems we were attempting to solve.  As we were using the new process we gathered information from people then reviewed the entire thing at around six months.  Based upon the feedback we made changes to the process, loosening somethings and tightening other parts.  We have another meeting to review this in a few weeks since there have been some new proposals for how to streamline the process.<p>As far as management learning the rules, I tend to not have too much issue with that.  If they don't follow the rules and are unwilling to comply their access to all systems will be shut off; the IT security group reports to me. :)  Once people know you will go so far as to shut off their access for not cooperating it is amazing how quickly they work with you when an issue arises.<p>For us there is always a process to get exceptions with any policy; but the person performing the action may not be authorized to give themselves an exception arbitrarily.",1335549003

3900238,comment,3899573,3899573,12,0,noduerme,,,"The point, as always, is that intelligent people find other intelligent people to hire by asking questions that aren't uniform or one-size-fits-all, or which only require regurgitation of facts, but rather by probing how and why a candidate thinks a certain way.<p>This should be obvious by now. Standard CV reviews, colleges and references say nothing about how efficiently a candidate is able to think through new problems or how elegant their solutions will be. Nor does that mean that formal training and real-world skill exist in an inverse relationship as a lot of self-taught coders (myself included) like to pretend it does. They simply aren't co-related, at least not as far as we can tell from most leading posts about hiring on HN.<p>So if the goal is efficiency, why not just hire people based on their IQ? What else is there that qualifies people for positions where their bosses 2 levels up have no idea how they're actually executing the work that's put in front of them, and rely completely on them to come to the best logical solutions to new problems creatively, quickly and every single time? The only other standard you might want to look for is trustworthiness, but you can't measure that in an interview.<p>Anyway, it doesn't matter if someone with 140+ IQ has ever coded before. It's probably worth paying to train them. So let's just cut to the chase.

Prototypal inheritance in itself probably wouldn't be all that confusing for these people  it's actually a simpler concept than classical inheritance. The issue with JavaScript's object system is that it's downright convoluted.<p>AFAIK, Self is the progenitor of prototype-based OO. In Self, the way you create a new object is just `someObject copy`. You can dynamically change its prototype later if you want, too. But in traditional JavaScript, you can't do that. You want an object? You need a constructor.

People know better than to monkey with object internals unless they have a good reason, in a way that doesn't seem to happen in javascript - I suspect because many perfectly sensible things in javascript look like monkeying around with object internals (foo.prototype.x = ...). Python is dynamically typed, but it gets away with it because its types are strict; if you think a is an int but it's actually a string, you'll catch it when you try and do a + 5. And even given that, python has added (weak, optional, but still there and standardized) type annotations. Code completion works, I don't know how but it does (maybe this could be done with javascript too). Modules are standard and heavily used.

I remember discussing this with a Swedish man who insisted that we thought of everything in language, and I was insisting instead that I think in <i>thought</i>, which does not necessarily map to language. What finally seemed to make him uncertain about his own hard-line position was to just say, ""look, I sometimes have the experience that <i>I don't know how to put my thoughts in words</i>. And I at least appear to be monolingual. It sounds like you're saying that this should be literally impossible. My thoughts are always <i>in</i> English, how could I ever have problems encoding them <i>into</i> English?""<p>Stephen Pinker's works have indirectly shown me one useful thing about these philosophical discussions: it helps to have an idea of Gdel/Turing-completeness[1] in your philosophy of language. The problem with the radical biological innatists[2] and the radical linguistic relativists[3] is that it seems hard to describe how languages evolve under either account. If our languages and proto-languages are in some sense Gdel-complete and can describe anything which is describable, then linguistic evolution just consists of building new language constructs which can more efficiently describe the new technologies -- and these in turn help us in thinking about our new technologies and making even newer technologies. You can also get a good distance in understanding how children acquire language; it's fundamentally similar to the bootstrapping process which gets a computer from being offline to running a modern operating system; a small set of built-in intuitions can construct a model for the entire rest of any logical system.<p>[1] Gdel's completeness theorem, as distinct from his more famous <i>incompleteness</i> theorem, says that a couple basic laws of logic are all you ever need, and any other logical system can be emulated by just constructing new objects whenever the axioms of the basic system call for them.<p>[2] something like, ""all the concepts which you find meaningful are somehow indirectly encoded in the genome, your words name just those concepts meaningful to you.""<p>[3] something like, ""if your language doesn't have a word for X, then you just cannot think about X, full stop.""",1335546819

3900059,comment,3899364,3899950,4,0,mistercow,,,"Well, the problem is that you're trying to bring analogies over from classical inheritance that don't directly apply. We're trained in classical languages to think of classes as being these blueprints in a strange hierarchy of blueprints and a ""constructor"" is this weird method by which a class transmutes itself from the abstract to the corporeal, producing an ""instance"".<p>In prototype-based OO, a constructor is just a function that builds an object. If you like, you can give that function a starting point for building its objects (the prototype), but in the end, it's just a function that builds an object. It's conceptually not that similar to a class in classical OO, even though you can use it to implement classical inheritance.<p>And that's really the core of the problem: read any book about JavaScript, and the first thing they'll probably tell you after introducing prototypes is how to get something like classical inheritance hierarchies by chaining prototypes together. So people end up thinking ""what a strange and roundabout way to handle classes"", when the problem is that they shouldn't be thinking about classes in the first place.<p>And here's the elephant in the room: long prototype chains are not usually the right solution because long inheritance chains <i>in general</i> are not usually the right solution. Classical inheritance just makes it so easy to build elaborate and beautiful hierarchies that most people never realize that doing so is usually just adding complexity for no real gain.",1335546752

Or rather, it's a fair question, but the answer doesn't depend on X. It is overwhelmingly a matter of network effects and social proof. What matters is what everyone else is using.<p>A programming language has a window of opportunity to gain mindshare while it's new. Once that window passes, the odds are hugely against it. It's true there are a few technical factors, for example that older implementations lack the infrastructure to work with newer technologies, but such things can be improved. The dominant factor, the real barrier, is social psychology. This is obscured by our tendency to retrofit plausible-sounding reasons to our choices (""X is slow"" or ""it doesn't have libraries"" or whatever).<p>This does suggest a strategy for reviving an old language: rebranding.<p>First, you need a new implementation. Trying to convince people to use the old one is like trying to get them to watch an old movie. George Lucas didn't promote Kurosawa, he made Star Wars. Second, there has to be a hook, something to convince us that this really is a new language, modern and with the times. So, light sabers. That's critical for opening a fresh window of opportunity instead of getting pegged to the old, long-closed one. It needn't be the most important thing, but it can't be fake either; it must be real enough or no one will take the new brand seriously. Without a convincing reason for why we weren't using X before, the new window will never open. Once it opens, then and only then do the beauty and power of X get their chance to bond with the user. In the Star Wars analogy, that would be the characters and the story  the deeper things that came from Kurosawa and ultimately from ancient archetypes. They'd never have gotten the chance to kick in if Star Wars hadn't got the audience in the theater. Once they did, though, then you had Star Wars fans for life.<p>With Clojure, the hook was Java libraries. Actually, there were three hooks. The others were concurrency and sequences.

A copy constructor is a constructor for type Tthat takes an existing T and initializes the new T to have the same underlying state.  So something like<p><pre><code>  class Foo\n  {\n  public:\n    Foo(const Foo& other) \n    {\n      //copy state from other Foo here  \n    }\n  };\n</code></pre>\nWhat this example is talking about is a normal constructor that can be (perhaps unintentionaly) used in the context of an implicit conversion, so something like<p><pre><code>  class Foo\n  {\n  public:\n    Foo(int heyThere)\n    {\n    }\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThis allows the C++ compiler to create an automatic conversion (in some instances) from int -> Foo simply by inserting a call to this constructor. So it can cause code like this to compile even if it was not intended<p><pre><code>  void HandleTheFoo(const Foo& theFoo)\n  {\n    //Do something here\n  }\n\n  void SomeMethod()\n  {\n    Foo intended; //assume there is a default ctor available even though I didn't show it above\n\n    int whoops = 5;\n\n    HandleTheFoo(whoops);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nMarking the constructor explicit prevents the compiler from using it in an implicit conversion context.",1335546422

make it more concise than Java by supporting local type-inference, first-class functions (closures), extension functions, mixins and first-class delegation, etc; and, keeping the useful level of expressiveness (see above), make it way simpler than the most mature competitor  Scala.</i>",1311947955

To users physically local to that/those servers yes direct access would be faster, but what about people out of sate? What about those on a completely different continent?<p>Most of Google's services are hosted in several distinct locations and they use and their DNS setup makes sure that any given user gets sent to the one closest to them.<p>Even without DNS to help by handing out different IP addresses for the same service depending on the location you are calling from, they have an anycast routing arrangement whereby even when referencing some things by IP address directly you will get a local service of which there are several. For instance if I ping one of their public DNS servers from my home connection (in the UK) I get:<p><pre><code>  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=56 time=30.6 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=29.2 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=28.9 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=56 time=38.4 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=56 time=36.5 ms
</code></pre>

  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=56 time=12.3 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=3 ttl=56 time=12.4 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=4 ttl=56 time=12.3 ms
  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=5 ttl=56 time=12.3 ms
</code></pre>
It is simply not possible, unless packets from/to one of those locations are travelling faster than light speed and/or nipping back in time during their journey, for these two locations to have been talking to the same server(s) despite using a specific address not a name.<p>As well as locality of reference, there is the benefit that your most local Google site is likely to be connected to the backbone by a faster pipe than your hosted servers (particularly for users of large ISPs who have more direct peering arrangements with Google). This comes into effect for any static content, or dynamic content where you can tell Google's checker when the content has not changed so the last version can be used, where the user does not need to wait for your server to respond in full to Google<p>For truly dynamic content this is going to be slower, but for many sites, especially if you have proper cache control on your dynamic content, I would expect this service to produce a measurable speed-up on average (obviously you'd have to test your specific site to see how much difference it truly makes) and it could save you a fair chunk of bandwidth if the site becomes popular.<p>This is certainly a service I'll keep my eye on with a view to maybe making use of it for certain projects if they ever get off the ground.",1311947468

We called the field advancing Human Potential.<p>During this time, we tried out all sorts of concepts, worked with world leaders and world class theorists and researchers.  We built all sorts of systems, and products, simulators, interactive games, expert systems, individual tutors, and other things of blended nature.  These products were built for governments, research institutes, and commercial companies. Some of the 'products' had empirical results that surprisingly showed that they were 'useful', too.  However, there weren't ever any revolutions in education or learning or educational theory, while I was there.<p>I eventually dropped out from this field from burnout.  Why? Because of the people.  This area of interest seems to attract people with very similar personality traits.  Reading this article and the subject reminds me of the type of people who want to 'solve' education.  It is not at all unusual to work with people in this field who complete advance degrees while still in puberty.  I worked with a guy who ended up the chair of mathematics at world-class university before he was 20.  These are all 'geniuses', as they have been taught and trained to think.  And, interestingly they all seem to clamor around this tall flag of solving education.<p>I believe the failure of this field is actually that most of these people running it are very 'left brain' analytical thinkers.  They think that they can solve these very dynamic, chaotic educational systems by decomposition and reductionism.  It's kind of funny actually.

Go through the pain of being the first person people talk to when stuff it broke. Try to fix it. Always try to fix it before you escalate. Preferably you get this job a mid-size company where you can have the opportunity to get to know the staff in general. Single office, walk around it once a day just saying hi to everyone.<p>Eventually they'll start to wait for you to make your rounds to get help. You're building relationships.<p>Get to know the maintenance and security guys in your building. These people need to be your friend. Your systems don't run without power, and you need to be able to get to consoles.<p>Watch for and take opportunities to get into a sysadmin position. Now, working on the trade skill of being lazy. Every task you do, think about how you can automate it. That's one of the real arts to being a sysadmin, if you have a lot of work that keeps you busy, how are you going to have time to respond to problems.<p>By taking this route though, you've built up one of the 4 skills I think you need to be a good sysadmin. People skills. Remember, by the time someone has to talk to you they've already had to deal with at least one other person who could not fix their problem. The rest of the skills you get from experience as a sysadmin. Scripting, documenting, creating DR scenarios and such... it's a never ending learning opportunity. If you've learned all there is to learn where you're at, then it's time to move on, unless you just really like it there. As often as not the latter is the case and that's not a bad thing as long as it pays the bills.<p>The one thing I always tell people who ask me to explain being a sysadmin to them is this. It's a service oriented position. The employees are your customers. The business is your customer. Your boss is your customer. You will hit a point where you think there is a technical answer to everything and you know better than them. You don't. It's not your job to make technology changes to change everything and make it easier. It's your job to implement and maintain what the business users feel they need to use to get their job done. Their positions make money for the organization you work for, your department is nothing but cost. Remember that and you can save yourself a lot of frustration.<p>Oh... and go home and build yourself a nice home network. This is a job where you take mental tasks home with you, having a place to play is helpful. Also helpful for job interviews.",1311946333

Even if AirBnB has seen the damage as reported by the host and the SFPD have a person in custody, what we have is the alleged destruction of property and alleged identity theft. Alleged, not proven.<p>> You know nothing about her.<p>Exactly, but what I do know is that there's a person who has made use of her blog three times this year: 1/22, 6/29 and 7/28. Two of those posts relate to AirBnB, drawing attention to the intense emotional trauma she's currently suffering and inattention and callousness that AirBnB is displaying towards her situation. Prior to that, we have an entry from 8/3/10. Nothing much to go by in order to assess who this person was prior to the AirBnB incident. Except we do have a blogroll link for ""My year of getting published"" dated one month ago. How odd.<p>Another thing that we have, and I'm drawing my own conclusions here, is the perfect recipe to get noticed in a sea-full of nerds: single vulnerable white female, lives alone in SF, violated by the actions of an unknown person or persons and who is crying out for help, appealing to the crowd who'll most like empathize with her: nerdy single guys who'd jump at the chance to put on their cape and save the day. It's too perfect of a recipe to ignore.<p>So what I'm saying is that she should get herself a lawyer, today, and have them handle her case and public relations going forward, because we all know that she's going to sue AirBnB and due to the amount of buzz she's been generating on the Twitters, my guess is that many a TV producer has been tasked with tracking her down for an interview. We'll see how that plays out.<p>If it took Chesky a whole month to address these issues of hers and implement changes in the organization to address them and those issues were real and valid, then shame on him, but something tells me that they may have expected this problem to go away.<p>I'm not trying to draw and links between this woman's complaint and those of the Groupon cafe owner, but it sees to me that, as always, people are engaging in activities whose potential consequences they know nothing about and in response they take to the web to generate outrage in support of their situation, but in those cases that I'm aware of, the stories start to unravel once they undergo any scrutiny beyond reading a blog post or two.<p>And if I'm still able to gauge public opinion correctly amongst the normals, most are going assume that you get what you deserve for handing the keys to your apartment to a total stranger for a whole week.

I know these jobs aren't looked upon with much respect by those of us in the engineering and development community who would rather say things directly to the customer...but here, an innocent attempt to cut through the redtape and get to the bottom of things  may have been misinterpreted by the customer to look much worse than it was...<p>I can totally see how the co-founder had the best of intentions and in his mind, was thinking ""She'll be grateful to see me cutting through the layers of BS and giving her a straightforward invitation to meetup"". Unfortunately, she saw the terse message and interpreted it in the worst light possible...and then reposted it to the world, with her interpretation.<p>When my car got wrecked by someone else's poor driving, I dreaded making the call to my insurance company to deal with it, even though all I had to do was report it to get my reimbursement.<p>The very first thing the customer rep said to me after I said why I was calling was, ""Are you OK? How are you doing?"" I was totally fine, and though this is most likely a script that they teach to anyone qualified to answer the phones...even if I were angry, it'd be difficult for me to rip on the customer rep (at that particular point).<p>In the airbnb case, if the co-founder had taken the five seconds to go through the motions of expressing the empathy that he felt, at the very least, this disgruntled customer couldn't claim on her blog that he had expressed no empathy for her situation and just wanted to get to deal making...which was probably quite the opposite of how he felt.<p>But yeah...it is a trivial bit in the big picture.

Custom UI enhancements/replacements, useless bundled apps that can't be removed, and the removal of standard, OS-delivered features. None of this should have been new or a surprise to the writer's mom, who was coming to Android from a feature phone. Feature phones have been plagued with the same crap for years, except they don't have a marketplace full of replacement apps that range from the serviceable to the remarkable.<p>I'm glad the author's mom found a smartphone she likes, but this isn't an Android problem. It may very well be a Google problem, since Apple was indeed successful in keeping the kruft off the iPhone, but Android devices come to market in a completely different way than iPhones, and as long as we sign over our rights in exchange for a $400 device discount we're going to have to deal with some of it.",1311944431

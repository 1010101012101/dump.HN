Insurance companies care about cost, but not really - it's easily passed to sponsoring employers or individual buyers anyway. Really, the only people that truly want cost reduced are the endpoint patients and their employers, who generally lack the clout and influence to push for real cost reductions. The entire system is broken. Costs have not lowered for health care, and will not lower, until the system is reorganized such that cost reduction becomes advantageous to all stakeholders.""<p>I'm not sure if we really agree all that much or not, but I do agree with this.  There's no way to keep from ballooning costs when the people paying are insulated from what they're paying for.<p>Unfortunately, it's largely broken as a result of some really strange incentives and a belief that employers should be responsible for their employees health care (rather than just paying employees and letting them deal with it).  HMOs, tax incentives to employers to provide health care, tax incentives to employees to take it, are all terrible, terrible things.<p>Fixing it will require that people ""pay"" for what they don't feel they're paying for right now.  I dunno about everyone else, but I'd rather be getting the extra $1200/yr my employer contributes to my health care and dealing in an actual free market than what we have now.  I think we'd all be paying a lot less, and getting better service.",1249671412

Instead I got a moderately lengthy and correct description of how to search for a value in a sorted binary tree. Correct, except for A: it wasn't the question I asked and B: immediate visual examination of the tree we were looking would reveal it was clearly not sorted. Other things in this interview led me to the conclusion that I got that answer because this person had studied that topic, but almost couldn't even hear, couldn't perceive a question that wasn't essentially right off an exam.<p>These are the ones who depress me a little, because they have clearly done everything everyone told them to do (study hard, do well on tests, etc) and must have some significant raw intelligence to be able to do this well on a challenging curriculum... yet, for all that, they have walked away with so very little useful knowledge or skills. I also feel some anger at the system that they have learned too well to navigate... but by the time they get to me, it's too late to change anything.<p>I comfort myself in the near-sure knowledge they will find a job somewhere. Some percentage of them  will even adapt to the real world and perhaps they will become great programmers. I don't know. I can't know. That's life.<p>But I can't in good conscience give a thumbs up for them. We are willing to train solid developers and we have a track record of hiring people that don't even know the language they will be working in (since they have demonstrated the ability to learn languages in the past), but you can only take that so far.<p>On the other hand, those who sat in college for four+ years and know neither the curriculum, nor any other skills, just barely squeaking by with the necessary grades and forgetting everything as soon as the class is over, well, they had every chance to realize they were in trouble and didn't take it. I don't feel depressed about them at all. That such people exist is just a fact of life.",1249671312

748293,comment,747549,747723,0,0,pyre,,,"It's worth mentioning that the usage of dovecot <i>makes</i> this configuration. I've had problems with using offlineimap + {mutt, maildir}. When offlineimap does maildir syncing it doesn't have the same information that it does if the maildirs are managed by an actual imap server.<p>Specifically, if I moved an email from my inbox to a tag/folder, offlineimap would end up just tossing it into the Trash.  I think this was because offlineimap stores metadata in the file name of the emails in the maildir, and mutt doesn't preserve that when moving from one maildir to another. So offlineimap would delete when syncing the inbox, and then gmail would maybe block it when it tried to sync it to the specified tag/folder (?). It's worth noting that this was with the Gmail IMAP option of 'delete when all visible tags removed' was enabled, and 'All Mail' was hidden from IMAP (but that was because without doing that it was a PITA to delete emails, b/c I would have to remove them from the folder <i>and</i> from All Mail... not to mention that syncing All Mail means downloading all your emails twice).",1249670948

748289,comment,748102,748234,0,0,mrkurt,,,"I've only ever seen statistics that compare the aggregate cost of health care relative to aggregate outcomes in the US vs other countries.  Do you have more details on the delta between pricing for specific services?<p>It's generally very difficult to compare the cost of specific services in any meaningful way.  For instance, many countries institute price controls on medication, cutting the cost of some prescriptions to 30% of what they'd cost in the US.  However, some of these drugs were developed in the US based on US patent law and with the assumption of a certain amount of profit from US consumers.  A price control in Canada is effectively subsidized by US consumers of a given drug, in lots of cases.<p>A great deal of the costs we pay come as a result of artificial scarcity of both drugs and medical services.  The result of legislation, fears of malpractice, and prescription requirements mean that treating a simple sinus infection (which I can diagnose reasonably well myself) costs ~$150 or so after the doctor visit and trip to the pharmacy.  There are a great many ways to attack that scarcity, but we're not really considering them (unfortunately).<p>Dean Kamen has a good point.  The level of medical care we <i>can</i> provide to people is both insane and insanely expensive.  High prices are rationing.  What we need to do is attack the high prices that are artificially inflated.",1249670830

Social friction, or even a low level power struggle emerges, in the worst cases, directing attention from other directors toward the immediacy of the contentious social situation on the board, in the worst cases fueled by sexism, but possibly just fueled by cultural differences.<p>(An older version of) the actual study is here:<p><a href=""http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/15730/1/WP2008-7a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hermes-ir.lib.hit-u.ac.jp/rs/bitstream/10086/15730/1/...</a><p>The abstract is:<p>Although some argue that tokenism drives the selection of female directors, we show that they have a significant impact on measures of board effectiveness. In a large panel of data on publicly-traded firms from 1996-2003, we ﬁnd that (1) the likelihood that a female director has attendance problems is 0.29 lower than for a male director, (2) male directors have fewer attendance problems the greater the fraction of female directors on the board, (3) ﬁrms with more diverse boards provide their directors with more pay-performance incentives, and (4) firms with more diverse boards have more board meetings.<p>We also show that the positive relationship between corporate performance measures and gender diversity documented by previous studies is not robust to attempts to address the endogeneity of diversity. Instead, the average effect of gender diversity on both market valuation and operating performance appears to be negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with greater shareholder rights. <i>In firms with weaker shareholder rights, gender diversity has positive effects.</i> Our results suggest that diverse boards are tougher monitors. Nevertheless, mandating gender quotas in the boardroom may not increase board effectiveness on average, but may reduce it for well-governed firms where additional monitoring is counterproductive.<p>The fact that diverse boards perform better than homogeneous boards where shareholder rights are weaker seems consistent with the hypothesis that the diminished performance of women directors is stress and contention based: perhaps the tensions between the male and female members of the board, the CEO, and the shareholders, are more difficult to work within than if the board needn't bow to the shareholders as much.",1249670375

He's talking about how making health care accessible to all will make it accessible to none - an interesting thesis, but ultimately one that has been soundly disproved by the success of public health systems in most of Europe and Canada.<p>He is partially right - the lack of extreme-expense health care drives out extreme high-end solutions such as the article's highlighted ""Luke"" arm, a prosthetic that is almost as good as the real thing.<p>But really, what do we want as a society? For a two-digit number of extremely wealthy people to have access to the world's best prosthetics, stuff that is in the realm of sci-fi? Or for <i>everyone</i> to have access to ""good enough"" prosthetic technology that advances more slowly?<p>""if talented people are given resources they're going to keep driving us to having better, simpler, cheaper solutions to problems""<p>Absolutely false, and proven by his own highest-profile project; the Segway hasn't gotten significantly cheaper or more accessible despite years of R&D, and is unlikely to become affordable anytime soon. This man's own business is a textbook case of the lie behind this claim. In order for solutions to get cheaper there must be market pressure to reduce cost: this is something that doesn't exist in America's current health care system.<p>Health care providers don't care about cost - it's passed along to insurance companies and consumers anyway. Insurance companies care about cost, but not really - it's easily passed to sponsoring employers or individual buyers anyway. Really, the only people that truly want cost reduced are the endpoint patients and their employers, who generally lack the clout and influence to push for real cost reductions. The entire system is broken. Costs have not lowered for health care, and will not lower, until the system is reorganized such that cost reduction becomes advantageous to all stakeholders.<p>He does make a cogent point in the end: more R&D will lead to better solutions and lower costs (given the right structure and incentives). But this argument is really independent of the affordability issue that plagues America today. Where I come from (Canada) we do a huge amount of pharmaceutical research (in fact, we invented the insulin injection) on government funds. I personally know very talented people working every day on cancer research.<p>Yet we can still afford to give everyone health care. Imagine that. A person can still get a major disease without going broke. Imagine that.<p>I really do think Dean Kamen is conflating two unrelated issues. The lack of R&D funding is an issue, but increasing R&D need not come from the pockets of consumers. Just look at the existing private system - a third of every health care dollar spent is just on administrative costs. Imagine if we took this money and threw it into R&D.",1249670228

I can't tell how fast it is (my guess is 'pretty slow right now'), but it has all the right scaling properties.<p>It works like a hashtable where the keys are distributed onto nodes based on their hash values. Each node takes a subset of the keyspace, and this subset can be dynamically reconfigured (so you can add nodes later and not have to move everything). You can also replicate each key onto several different nodes for fault-tolerance.<p>It doesn't attempt to address transactions; instead, when people make branching updates, it keeps all the branches. (Think how Git works -- it deals with fast-forward automatically.) You have to merge them yourself -- when you do a get and there are multiple branches, you get all the heads.<p>It's based on Erlang and has a pluggable backend storage system, so you don't have to deal with ETS if you don't want to.

Also they might sell a license to an after market shop so they can say they are the official Tesla parts brands.",1249669094

It's long, at 46 pages including data tables.  Here's the abstract:<p>""We show that female directors have a significant impact on board inputs and firm outcomes. In a sample of US firms, we find that female directors have better attendance records than male directors, male directors have fewer attendance problems the more gender-diverse the board is, and women are more likely to join monitoring committees. These results suggest that gender-diverse boards allocate more effort to monitoring. Accordingly, we find that chief executive officer turnover is more sensitive to stock performance and directors receive more equity-based compensation in firms with more gender-diverse boards. However, the average effect of gender diversity on firm performance is negative. This negative effect is driven by companies with fewer takeover defenses. Our results suggest that mandating gender quotas for directors can reduce firm value for well-governed firms.""<p>The pre-print PDF seems to have encryption/defense against copy/paste, so I can't post further extracts here.",1249668745

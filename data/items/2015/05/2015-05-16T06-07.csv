This can be used to prohibit fragmentation in cases where the receiving host does not have sufficient resources to reassemble internet fragments.<p>One example of use of the Don&#x27;t Fragment feature is to down line load a small host.  A small host could have a boot strap program that accepts a datagram stores it in memory and then executes it.</i><p>What it seems to mean is things like PXE[1] or BOOTP[2].<p>Basically, DF was built to allow the sender to optionally force zero fragmentation by intermediate hosts en-route that are connected to networks with a smaller MTU than the packet size originally emitted by the sender. This was <i>originally</i> intended to be of use because the sender was somehow made aware of limitations in the recipient&#x27;s network stack.<p><i>Probably</i> 20 or more years ago it was used for awhile as a latency-related hack for certain applications (VOIP, video, low-latency finance, certain scientific experiments generating vast amounts of data, etc.) mostly on UDP[3], though we have better methods for those now that operate through other IP headers (QoS).<p>Theoretically, intermediate nodes could also use it as part of path selection during routing, though I have no idea if this has been done or is encouraged - eg. a packet from node A reaches node B en-route to node C. Node B has two routes to node C. The lower-cost route is available with a smaller MTU than the packet size, and a higher-cost route is available with a large enough MTU to accommodate the packet size. The DF flag could be used by routing logic at node B to automatically shuffle the packet across that higher-cost route.<p>I believe the <i>Path MTU discovery</i>[4] feature of modern Linux kernels also probably uses this mechanism combined with short TTLs (ie. maximum hop counts, which also cause ICMP errors to be returned on their failure, and are the basis of <i>traceroute</i>[5], itself an unintended hack based on unrecognized capabilities of the IP protocol&#x27;s specification) to optimize long-lived traffic flows.<p>There must be other edge-case or optimization-related wishy-washy reasons to set it, too. The main thing to remember is: none of these were really intended by the authors of IPv4. This whole historic pile of what-if edge-case hackyness has been thrown out in favor of a better system in IPv6[6].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_Discovery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_MTU_Discovery</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Simplified_processing_by_routers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Simplified_processing_by_r...</a>",1431759115

I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street.

9555257,comment,9551378,9555067,0,0,BrendanEich,,,"The &quot;and&quot; and &quot;the&quot; line was from Mary McCarthy in reply to Lillian Hellman. You&#x27;re Hellman :-|.<p>You wrote:<p>&quot;As to support for other languages, I only have to point out that one of Mozilla&#x27;s reasons for decrying Google&#x27;s intended browser support for Dart was that Dart compiled to JS would not be competitive with the native Dart implementation.&quot;<p>The empty rhetorical flourish (&quot;I only have to point out...&quot;) aside, this is rank question-begging. You <i>assume</i> that JS as Dart target being too slow must mean DartVM should win because of &quot;competitive&quot; force. Wrong on at least two counts (I&#x27;ll ignore market power abuse):<p>First, DartVM may be faster at semantics JS supports due to optimization problems on the JS engine side. V8 in particular lost its founding team to DartVM, except for some moonlighting. Therefore &quot;competitive&quot; does not mean that JS cannot improve to be as fast when compiled from Dart as when the Dart source runs in DartVM.<p>Second, DartVM may have types and optimizations that JS lacks, bignums for example. Again &quot;competitive&quot; does not mean JS cannot change, and in fact bignums have been on the ECMAScript Harmony agenda since 2010, before &quot;Dash&quot; leaked.<p>In any competitive market with deep tech, there are lots of ways to meet a set of developer-facing language support/performance requirements. Even with all Google&#x27;s billions, Dart and Chrome decision-makers couldn&#x27;t ignore the compile-to-JS alternative and continue to justify developing and shipping DartVM + OilPan + all else not fully in hand to support JS and Dart with no performance regressions. Compiling to JS is the sole path forward for Dart on the Web <i>precisely</i> due to competition.<p>Citing my argument about bignums is perversely wrong, unless you assume DartVM is the only solution to any DartVM vs. dart2js performance disparity.<p>Such an assumption, like the one you seem to have made about NaCl, is anti-competitive, uneconomic, magical thinking. It requires indefinite amounts of time and money to fund all the work to have two VMs, a super-GC to collect cycles, write barriers as part of that super-GC, and more optimization to overcome the performance regressions imposed by those barriers (if possible). It assumes JS can&#x27;t more cheaply be extended to be a fast-enough target language. You offer no proof.<p>BTW, you started out with NaCl and I still think you&#x27;re mistaken about something pretty fundamental. NaCl was never proposed as a Web standard. Ok, suppose you mean PNaCl. The problem remains that PNaCl required a big API, Pepper, to reach the guts of chromium/Blink (originally WebKit) and the underlying OS. The problem with PNaCl was always Pepper, and again: competition killed Pepper as a cross-browser API.<p>It takes longer (it would have happened sooner with more cooperation from Google earlier, instead of the malinvestment on these two big follies), but JS is getting SIMD and shared memory threads, which are among the last few bricks still standing in the Pepper wall.<p>So PNaCl is evolving with Emscripten/asm.js now -- precisely due to competition -- and I would not hold my breath for PNaCl to remain based only on LLVM bitcode (with fixes requiring years and millions, to remove unspecified behavior). But feel free to hold your breath and then blame the &quot;vendor cartel&quot; if you like.<p>On that &quot;vendor cartel&quot; point, there are more web engines coming along, Servo (an open source project with multiple paying companies involved) among them. There&#x27;s no cartel, just a big compatibility hill for any new engine to climb.<p>Adding gewgaws like NaCl and Dash slows down that climb. It&#x27;s uncompetitive for the would-be market entrant. Why you think this requires collusion (&quot;cartel&quot;) or Satanic pride (&quot;reign in Hell&quot;) is unclear. Do you get many billion-dollar free lunches where you live?",1431758962

On that note, allow me to offer a fun set of mental tangents.<p>Lambda (uppercase Λ, lowercase λ) and the Chinese character for human (人) are not visually dissimilar. Lambda is asserted to have derived from early semitic forms, which influenced Pstalter and Soghdian, each of which allegedly reached the western limits of Chinese empire and existed circa 400BCE.[1] Written Chinese has been around for about 2500 years. It also has another similar character - 入 - which in classical or ancient Chinese can mean &#x27;to join&#x27; or &#x27;to become a member of&#x27;.  They say humans are social creatures, and social structures are built on identification. However, <i>lambda</i> in the programming sense means an &#x27;anonymous&#x27; function. Unlike Indo-European languages, ancient Chinese in particular defaults to anonymity (operating on a higher level of abstraction by default - ie. less specific, more poetic, more applicable) due to an absence of enforced conjugation.

Also, it sounds like there is something wrong with the Rust compiler if this landing pad generation really <i>doubles</i> the compile time... a poor compiler should not influence the language design in such a negative direction.<p>Solving problems like your iterator issue should not be difficult with exceptions: in fact, frankly, I don&#x27;t see why it is any harder than with Result: your worst case is that you start with a primitive, &quot;antitry!&quot; (which should be called &quot;try!&quot;, as it makes more sense than what &quot;try!&quot; currently does for that word) which performs an operation and returns a Result of either its value or its failure. Even if you do this &quot;frequently&quot;, I would be shocked if this was remotely as common as the code that was assuming success and just wanted to fail if something fails. And, as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to &quot;handle&quot; those errors (and it doesn&#x27;t sound like you are, you just kind of want to fail out with a list of failure reasons) there is no semantic complexity either. Exceptions are the flexible primitive, not Result: simulating Result from exceptions requires a tiny finite amount of code, while simulating exceptions using Result requires modifications to an arbitrarily large amount of code.<p>As for fixing panic, what really sucks is that so much library code is going to be written using Result now when much of it should have been written with panic, both in the core library and from third-party developers, meaning that the boilerplate is going to be somewhat inescapable at the lowest levels of the program... I think the thing I like most about programming in Python vs C++ is that I don&#x27;t have to wrap every single API I use to make it handle errors in a sane way. I don&#x27;t think that fixing panic at some point in the future is going to work as there seems to be such awkward community momentum against exceptions and behind Result, when the real RFC needs to be &quot;when you write your library, try to use panic, not Result&quot;.",1431756289

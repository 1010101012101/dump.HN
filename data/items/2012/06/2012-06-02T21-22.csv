4059311,comment,4058349,4058682,9,0,TheCount,,,"To explain the issue further, tersely, at the risk of being downvoted, in America, the average  score among blacks is a standard deviation lower than that of whites, on IQ tests, that is, 15 points. Given that IQ is normally distributed for the most part, using IQ as a factor in hiring will reduce the proportion of blacks who pass the 'bar.'<p>This gap may diminish if you're looking at a pool of people who passed some previous threshold, eg they have a degree in math. But even then, some of the gap remains, due to the shape of normal distributions. Think of the heights of men and women, and how even if you looked only at people six feet and taller, the proportion of women in that pool who just barely meet the threshold of 6' would be much higher than the similar group of men; despite the cutoff, the average height of the women would still be less than the average height of the men, within that group. Draw overlapping bell curves to see this visually, and analyze the areas under the graph of each distribution, to the right of a given cutoff point.<p>We do have a law against invidious racial discrimination. The current implementation of the law states that in practice, if some selection mechanism has a passing rate for one minority that is less than 80% of that whites, that is evidence of discrimination in the absence of validation of that mechanism. This is known as the four fifths rule. A test in which 10% of whites and 7% of blacks passed would fall afoul of this law. Say you set a 115 IQ threshold. That is +1 S.D. from the white mean roughly, and +2 S.D. from the black mean, meaning 16% of whites and 2.3% of blacks would pass, if drawing from the general population. That wouldn't even pass a 'One fifth rule,' let alone a four fifths one.<p>And validation is no sure thing either - police and fire departments have had these tests validated and still have the results thrown out regularly, due to disparate racial impact, i.e. relatively few blacks and Hispanics (average IQ: ~90) passing the test.<p>On a related note, explicit racial and gender quotas are more efficient than the race- sex- and IQ-blind, approach in use today. A quota would mandate in effect different thresholds for different groups, but it would allow one at least to use this selection mechanism. Within given groups, one would obtain more efficient outcomes. The problem with quotas is that they make racial preferences explicit, while abandoning such selection methods entirely is only an implicit, de facto racial preference, a rather subtle and hidden one at that.",1338674283

4059307,comment,4058857,4059255,1,0,barrkel,,,"No page file generally means apps crash hard when they reach the limit of memory. On a multi-tasking OS not set up for making individual applications hibernate, that's a recipe for data loss.<p>Back in the days of 16-bit Windows, we had this thing called cooperative multitasking. It sucked. It meant that a single unresponsive application could potentially lock up the entire system, and you'd lose all apps. Now, we have preemptive multitasking. The OS calls the shots. Without a page file, we'd be back into a similar situation re memory: a single app could consume most of the system, and all other apps would fail on allocation - and most apps are not written to be stable in the face of allocation failures. It's either that, or background apps would need to be suspended or killed arbitrarily by the OS, or some other kind of drastic limitations on productive work.<p>I have 16GB of memory in my system; but I regularly run utilities that consume a large fraction of that (enough that the 12GB in my previous system was starting to look pokey - and my prior system with 8GB IIRC, I had to run utilities sequentially instead of in parallel to avoid page thrashing). The advantage of having lots of memory is that you can write utilities that build massive in-memory data structures. Problems are way easier to solve when you can rely on being able to stuff everything into a big hash table, rather than worry about temporary files on disk, or god forbid faffing around with a database and losing orders of magnitude of performance.<p>Page files, even in the presence of large amounts of RAM, are what enable this approach on workstations, in two ways: it means you won't suffer an app crashing from out of memory as you skirt the line of maximum physical memory; and secondly, and probably more importantly, page files backing allocated pages means the OS is able to free up memory sooner for those applications that demand it.<p>If you use your computer for casual use and don't stress it or do much critical work with it (i.e. use it much like you would a phone or tablet), you can get by just fine without a page file. But if you actually want to use the thing, a page file is a very handy thing to have.",1338674201

At that point outlets arent polarized and the case might end up connected either to ground or to the hot wire depending on how you plug it in. Even when outlets are polarized<p>> Occasionally an electrician will accidentally wire an outlet backwards. This can't be helped, because Perfect Electricians are far more expensive than the normal human variety. And so we cannot intentionally wire appliance cases to the Wide Prong of the plug, since it would cause a lethal hazard if the appliance was plugged into a miswired wall outlet. Miswired outlets look exactly the same as the normal ones.<p>> The solution? Why, add a Third Prong! Connect this prong to the neutral side of the network, but do it only in one place in the circuit, and run a new third wire out to all of the wall-outlets. Give this wire a new color, one which is different from the other two. Give this this third prong a very different shape as well, so even Highly Imperfect Electricians will rarely connect the special prong to the wrong wire. Inside metal-cased appliances, insist that manufacturers connect this third wire to the case.",1338672870

And most of them are easily solvable if you think in a structured manner (a thing mathematician, programmers, physic's, etc. tend to do).

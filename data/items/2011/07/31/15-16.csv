2828567,comment,2828462,2828462,6,0,scrrr,,,"Coming directly from university I was earning about 45.000 Euro (+ Bonus) at a top-5 consulting firm here in Germany.<p>After one year I started to get very bored. In my free time I picked up Ruby and Rails and finally could not stand Enterprise Java and ABAP (SAP) any more and quit my job. I didn't have any freelance gigs set up yet, but I knew that I wanted to work with RoR.<p>Through a mailing list I landed a job at a Rails-startup and started to work there for about 300 Euro per day. Freelance. They didn't care if I was a normal employee or a freelancer, so I just said I want to freelance.<p>It was the best decision I have made in a long time.<p>First of all working for a startup you learn about 10 times as much as for a big company. There's just more stuff that needs to be done. From tweaking the database to writing front-end javascript. My colleagues were great tutors and especially through several sessions of pair programming I picked up some good skills that would otherwise have taken me a much longer time.<p>I also decided to work only 4 days per week, on average, which left me with one extra day for my private projects. While the jury is still out if we will succeed, it was a very comfortable situation, since I could work two days on my own stuff (Fri + Sat) and have the Sunday off.<p>Today I work for 500 Euro a day for a larger company that decided to use Ruby. They don't really care when I show up as long as the work gets done. I don't get called to as many meetings as the regulars and I know in a few months it will be over and I'll be working on something completely new.<p>Job situation: It's not ""totally awesome"" but by maintaining a network of other freelancers I'm never out of work. If one guy is engaged and gets an offer, he forwards it to the others, and vice versa. I'm not afraid I'll get in a financial crisis any time soon, because I have very nice savings and because I can always get a regular job for a big company, should I ever run out of offers.<p>I think it's important to stay up to date on new things (say the new RoR version or interesting ruby gems, nosql databases or caching methods), because a part of my job is consulting and offering suggestions, but that is easily done by reading blogs, watching some Railscast now and then and monitoring sites like HN.<p>So my suggestion is: Go for it. If everything fails, you're still a software engineer, a currently very sought after profession. (I assume it's the same in Scandinavia.) Remember: A regular job isn't very safe either. If the economy collapses you can still be laid off.<p>Todos: Find out about insurance and taxes. At least in Germany you're basically leaving the social security safety-net when becoming self-employed.<p>And yes, a long commute really takes the joy out of life. Quick tip: Get a kindle, use Instapaper to sync articles and read them on the train. ;)",1312127041

As you should well know, one of the first rules of business is never to take it personally.  Here's a re-post of a suggestion I just made to Brian Chesky:<p>""Although there have been negative PR effects for Airbnb due to this incident, it appears that they have benefited as well, by wisely using the lesson learned to improve their business by adding essential insurance and pre-deal inter-member communications services, among other things. The future value of that benefit to a start-up company most likely far exceeds the damages suffered by this host, assuming the PR issue can be positively resolved. There was no similar benefit for the host, unless you count the lesson learned that they should avoid the sort of activity your business is built around.<p>""So here's a suggestion: acknowledge publicly that this incident exposed ways in which the service could be improved and offer to make this one host whole as compensation for that value. Solves everybody's problems in one fell swoop without accepting blame for something that isn't Airbnb's fault (and more importantly without resorting to blaming the victim - not the host's fault either). I'll bet it would cost far less than the usual media blitz companies commonly use to repair their images after incidents such is this. Consider it a good investment in the company's future.""<p>It appears that Airbnb has made moves in this direction.  You say, and EJ confirms, that some financial compensation has been offered, but apparently EJ remains unconvinced that meaningful compensation will be forthcoming.  Given the mixed responses EJ has reported from Airbnb staff and mixed messages we see from Airbnb in the media (claims of compensation offers and links to TOS policies denying compensation), I can't say I blame her.  This needs to be remedied immediately, and all it would take is a press release and personal communication between Brian Chesky and EJ.  Her remarks which were far less flattering toward Airbnb in her second post could have been avoided had she been contacted by someone in authority at Airbnb expressing concern for her problem rather than concern for theirs.  You should have realized that her problem IS your problem.<p>The difference between ""oh, they're the company that made immediate efforts to improve security and insurance options after being completely blindsided along with the host when somebody ransacked an apartment and went the extra mile to compensate the victim even though they weren't legally obligated to"" and ""oh, they're the company that was so concerned about the effects on their funding efforts that they tried to suppress the story and blame everyone else when one of their customers ransacked the apartment of another customer"" when someone thinks of ""Airbnb"" depends wholly upon how the crisis is responded to.  So far, Airbnb has done at least as much to reinforce the latter image as the former.  You need message discipline and a positive message, and you need it now.",1312126907
2828556,comment,2827882,2828379,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"I remember a story from a book (could've been Innovator's Dilemma, I don't remember), where he said that around 1900's I believe, they needed 200 humans to do a job, like carrying a big lumber from a cargo ship.

The question of how EULAs can have any legal standing if you don't buy the software directly from the copyright holder was raised: if a contract necessarily involves consideration in both directions, and you get nothing of value from the copyright holder in return for ""agreeing"" to their often onerous EULA after you've completed the purchase of your software from a third party, what right do they have to impose any conditions on you at all? The answer being debated was that by merely running the software in the normal manner for which it was purchased, you are inevitably making copies (in RAM etc.) and thus copyright law applies and you require a licence. Ah, but making transient copies in the course of normal use is excluded from copyright by the point of law we're discussing, right?

You should also have your spouse on board with you emotionally before you do this - money/work fights can be a big problem if you're not both going in the same direction.<p>Ultimately, I suspect you can always go back and get another job someplace, although perhaps not as cushy as you have now.<p>Depending on how antsy you are, you could set a goal of 3 months from now (only 12 weeks) to have another month of runway saved up, and 2-4 paying client projects started or ready to start in October.",1312126569

This unique plugin is authorized to request keys for messages for your Trusted Contacts and generate new keys associated with your account.<p>The keys are generated in parallel on the client and on the key management server. They are always rolling forward and are synced with the key management server in real-time utilizing a few unique variables within your custom plugin and a few generated randomly each time.<p>No two messages are encrypted with the same key and keys are only stored in memory during the encryption / decryption process. Every time a message or photo that has been protected is viewed, either by yourself or others, authorization to that messages key is requested from the key management server.<p>Your Trusted Contact list is managed globally by connecting with other users through Social Fortress. Within Facebook all of your friends are initially treated as Trusted Contacts and you can easily remove individuals from this list with the click of a button.<p>Social Fortress uses AES-256 CTR for the encryption and communicates over a 256 SSL stream from your device to the key management server. The data in this stream is also encrypted using aspects of your customized installation.<p>The technology for web services (Facebook, Google+) operates as browser plugin for Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer[1] and independent of any service's API.<p>The technology for Thunderbird and Outlook is a separate plugin which requires installation.<p>We integrate transparently into the products we support so the user experience is exactly the same. No extra clicks, no confusing decisions and nothing extra to learn. We designed Social Fortress to be used by individuals who don't even know what the word encryption is.<p>Within every environment you have the ability to enable / disable Social Fortress protection with the click of a button or using a keyboard shortcut (CTRL+Q). This only disables the encryption functions. The reader is always on so messages and photos protected by your friends appear normal without you having to protect your own. It's like having Flash or PDF Reader once it is installed you don't ever have to do anything again.<p>If your device becomes compromised / lost / whatever you can login to the site and disable all active installations in two clicks and this will not affect previously encrypted messages as we just disable authorization access to your old plugins and have no need to change any previously generated keys.<p>We also support other services but have yet to make them live:<p>Skype Chat<p>Twitter<p>mail.yahoo.com<p>Gmail.com<p>Chatter.com<p>Yammer.com<p>Blackberry Native Email support<p>[1] The IE Plugin is not currently part of the public beta.",1312124977

For example, if you work in Cupertino, you can live in Gilroy; for other parts of the valley, you can live in Livermore. There are also cheap parts of the southern East Bay that are pretty nearby.<p>Even the central part of SV is quite cheap compared to NY for some living profiles. Buying a house is expensive, but renting one is relatively cheap. Going rate for a 2-bedroom house in a tract development in Santa Clara is maybe $1500/mo, while even out in Queens you're not going to find a house at $1500/mo.<p>I'm not sure where they got the $2250/mo <i>average</i> apartment price from; that seems high.

2828473,comment,2828136,2828136,14,0,tansey,,,"These stats are outrageous and the presentation is misleading:<p>1) Please do not go thinking that $7.5B in VC deals * 46% are seed/series A = ~$3.2B in seed money. The bulk of that money is skewed upward to the other 54%. If we assume the average size of a deal in the 46% is around $300k (since series A rounds are more and seed rounds are less), then you get about a $100M market for early-stage investments.<p>2) The section titled ""Average Salaries in the Valley"" is actually a graph of median salaries. It worries me that the infographic uses the terms ""average"" and ""median"" interchangeably, though at least they chose the better statistic for the chart. They also make no mention of stock options or equity that you get with those salaries, so it's not really a total compensation number.<p>3) The buying power part is completely off base. Having lived in San Diego for 3 years before moving to Palo Alto, I can definitely say I would rather make $92k here than $59k in SD. I imagine they are including all of San Diego County, which is huge and has vast differences in quality of life. Compare that to Silicon Valley, which is generally nice everywhere you go. If you're living in a comparable part of San Diego, I would imagine you are looking at no more than a 10% difference, tops.<p>4) The cost of housing is also ludicrous. Either the average is getting skewed because of some super expensive listings or they are simply talking about the average price of a lease. I just moved out of a 5 bedroom house in Palo Alto which cost $3300/mo. I was paying $650/mo for my room, which is about $150 <i>less</i> than what I was paying to live in UTC in San Diego and about half the cost of a beach-front apartment rental there.<p>In summary, there's lies, damned lies, and statistics.

The genes activated in those neurons were determined.<p>3. Genetic engineering was done to make the activation of those genes always happen in conjunction with activation of the gene being responsible for the neuron becoming sensitive to light.<p>4. The mouse was put through a learning experience, during which the small group of neurons affected became sensitive to light.<p>5. Via stimulating those neurons with light, the experience was reproduced in the mouse in a completely different environment (so the comparisions to Pavlov are not justified).<p>In this way the abstract concept of a memory and of the process of remembering something was related very closely to a specific physical phenomena. Even the methods used to make the experiment are interesting by themselves (at least for a lay person) and I think you cannot easily dismiss the importance of this discovery as some people do here.

Sure, it looks fairly similar, but the 'magic' like the kudos system and the pretty like CSS features that set the two apart are enough for me to distinguish between the original and the clone.
From the first article I read on dcurtis' site, I noticed the simplicity to the design and really liked it. 
When I started to read the article yesterday about his svtble network, I thought to myself, 'sweet, I can finally use this.' 
And then I got to the last line, and all that went away. I don't like exclusivity, and while the idea behind the 'every time you see this theme it will feature great bloggers' thing was good, I felt like he could have very easily made a stripped down version of the theme that differed a bit from the 'premium model' for the general public to adopt. Or perhaps not even the general public but rather one to just release within Hacker News, a (if I make a generalization) smarter than average community.

I remember I came to the admitted students weekend and toured one of the dorms. The walls were covered with murals and the floors with junk --- motors, robot parts, circuit boards.  People had built their own lofts; someone had rigged their door to open automatically when it recognized them. Someone had hooked up a camera and a projector so that you could ""draw"" on one of the nearby buildings with a laser pointer.<p>So of course, I came to MIT. I remember discovering pg's essays around sophomore year and starting to consider starting my own company, but my transformation really began when I set foot here at MIT, where creative and curious people build mind-blowing things every day.<p>At first it's intimidating. These people all seem so smart! Who am I to build a roller coaster, paint a 20 foot mural, build a loft, hack a PS3, build a crazy device and start a company out of it? You hear about these things in the abstract and you're intimidated. But then you get home and see people building a roller coaster in your courtyard and you realize: Who am I <i>not</i> to do awesome things?  Life is too short, damn it. It seems obvious to the entrepreneurially minded, but it's hard to describe the impact it had on me. I could've learned the same course material in many other places.

I understand how the algorithm works mathematically but how is it implemented on the server?  More specifically, how does the server keep its rankings updated if each stories rank decays as a function of the time since submission?  The ranks must be getting continuously calculated at some point, but I'm not sure when that would be--it doesn't make sense to calculate them on request, and there are way too many stories to be constantly processing all of them all the time.  My thought is that the rank is recalculated after each vote, and there must also be some rank threshold at which a story's rank is automatically processed and recalculated continuously in the background, this way the recent stories are constantly being processed while older ones past the threshold become stale and are ignored.  This could also be why there is no real pagination (instead the next url is /x/fnid=xxxxxxxxxx), possibly to discourage people from going too deep. I could also be completely wrong.

This is what dcurtis probably should have done. He didn't do any groundbreaking rails code, and there was very little value in having a new workflow of blogging exist only on his servers. I think the value of Nate open sourcing it is much higher than if he had just built a clone and kept it to himself.<p>Basically, the community response supporting Nate is strong because he did something that benefits the community as a whole, where as dcurtis did something that benefited only himself and then shouted about it.<p>That's my (pretty myopic and polemic) take on all this.",1332524702

The more you make yourself aware of the important issues developers need to worry about, the smarter you can be with your decisions and cash. Happy you're pursuing it!<p>Should you hire someone or learn to do it yourself? That depends on a few things: Are you planning on making money on this idea? Does your interest in pursuing the idea depend on the success of the idea? Do you have a limited window of time to execute on your idea for it to be successful? If there's no urgency to run to market, then I recommend doing it yourself. There's nothing more satisfying.<p>If you ARE interested in hustling with this idea, then you need to start sourcing your network for help. Do you personally know any developers? Do they want to help you develop a prototype? Do they know anyone who might? Do you know any computer science/engineering students who might want extra experience this summer? Do you know anyone who works in a Computer Science program or college that could help you source interns? Get involved in your local tech community. Go to meetups and find people who are active and involved. Ask them if they know anyone they could introduce you to. Ask people if you can help them with anything they're working on. (Be sincere!)<p>I wouldn't focus on trying to find a technical co-founder at this point. This can be something that sits at the back of your mind while you're looking for help, but going around asking for a co-founder is like asking the girl to marry you too soon. It would be a shame to pass on good help because they weren't ""founder"" material. When talking to people who might help you, ask for small portions of help. People are willing to help a little here and there without thinking twice. If they like interacting with you, you'll definitely feel comfortable asking for more assistance (and it's likely they'll offer without you having to ask).<p>Show the people you're talking to that you've invested a lot of time on this already.

The startup I co-founded began receiving leads and of course not all leads are a good fit for our product.  I'm a developer and have never been in a sales role previously, but when you are the only salaried employee and a co-founder, you do what needs to be done.  So I've been following up with the leads and in a five minute conversation it becomes clear if our solution is the best solution.  When I started, I made the mistake of trying to convince everyone that our product could do everything they wanted.  Then I realized this tactic was not only exhausting, but ultimately would lead to dissatisfied, short-term customers.  Once I made the switch to using the same techniques the OP describes, not only was the sales process far less stressful, but I found myself enjoying talking to people and just trying to help them.  If our solution is a good fit, great, but if it isn't, I'm not going to BS you.

That's not really such a shock, nor does it justify the poo-flinging at TSMC.<p>So the real question in my mind is whether TSMC is having problems that the other foundries (Samsung or Global Foundries, say) are not.  Given that Intel has been sampling 22nm parts already, it seems like the real news hers is that  TSMC sucks and the bit about production costs are just ammunition.",1332523984

If I understand correctly, Nvidia has nowhere else to go since TSMC is so far ahead of other independent foundries (I'm not sure how independent GF really is - is it conceivable for Nvidia to work with GF?) and it can't very well go to Intel given the amount of competition they are engaged in. Maybe Samsung?<p>Also, I'm not clear on the arguments presented in the slides. The transistor normalized price curves for 20nm and 14nm do eventually cross over the preceding curves, unlike the 40nm curve. And even putting the same transistor count on a smaller process node can result in lower power consumption once the leakage problems are mitigated, so the value is increased.<p>Edit: For historical background, here's a fascinating conversation from 5 years ago between Morris Chang (founder and chairman, TSMC) and Jen-Hsun Huang (CEO, Nvidia):<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-x7PdnvCyI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-x7PdnvCyI</a>",1332523775

3746170,comment,3745800,3746042,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Regarding founders and hard work, it's of a different nature from the typical image of people working hard. It's not like an investment bank where people are fired if they aren't in the office from 8 to midnight. Startupers tend to spend 80 to 100 hours on their startups, but no one is ""making"" them do it. It's extremely focused engagement.<p>I think it's still counterproductive and unhealthy to work that much (although 60 is sustainable and not unhealthy when you enjoy what you're doing and have a lot of autonomy) but it's not something that happens because startups really require huge amounts of work. They require a lot more commitment and energy than average jobs, but 60 hours is more than enough in most cases (except for people involved in fundraising, which is a hellish and time-consuming slog I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy's tapeworm) to get things done.<p>What causes that insanity in hours is that the extremely high stakes lead to a persistent sense of needing to do more. This causes a lot of people to have serious anxiety, and you know what's a good antidote to anxiety (in moderation)? Work. (Work itself is not very stressful: most people <i>like</i> their work; what they hate is the political and interpersonal stress associated with high-stakes organizational social-climbing.)

I need advice on how to move my idea forward. This idea has been keeping me up at night constantly. Obviously, I lack the technical skills needed to personally build my idea. Even though I am proud of creating a Firework's click-through prototype! I am currently learning to code with Codeyear, but it's safe to assume that it would take a long time for me reach a level where I can build it myself. I have personal money (50k) that I am willing to invest to start the build. Don't want to burn through those funds by hiring the wrong freelancers or company. Not to mention, I lack the technical savvy and experience to find a quality person or company to hire. It is better to pay to have it built, try to learn to code, or hope that I can find a technical co-founder?<p>Thanks for any advice!",1332522964

3746126,comment,3745800,3746049,7,0,michaelochurch,,,"I agree with you. For two other categories of employment, the risks, rewards, and promises are clearly laid out.<p>Founders: take on risk (no salary pre-seed, zero job security) but get a massive payout if it works.<p>Big-company employees: no risk, high job security, guaranteed payout.<p>For startup employees, the bargain is murky and implicit. These employees take some risk and stress (not as much as founders, but probably 30-40% as much) in exchange not for a huge payout, but for the promise of a leadership position when the company gets big. <i>That</i>'s the (implicit) contract. It's not, ""Get $100 million when this thing exits"" but ""Get a VP-level position, that might help you along to something else, when we hit 500 people"".<p>The implicit nature of that bargain makes it problematic. A founder with 5% in equity is always going to have those shares of stock. (His percentage can be diluted, but he has legal recourse if it's done improperly.) Even if he's fired, he has whatever equity he has vested. The early employee (whose equity amount is small) who worked his ass off to get a leadership position in the company as it grew can be denied that opportunity at any time for any reason.<p>There isn't an easy solution, because some early employees don't deserve the leadership positions they want, but they usually aren't bad enough to be fired either. My solution would be to give them very small-scale leadership, or even autonomous contributor status (they can work on whatever they want, but can only pull other people to their projects if someone else thinks it's a good idea) as a token of appreciation. Perhaps that's because I think there are few truly incompetent people; some just don;'t grow as fast, for whatever reason.<p>There's another dynamic that hits this whole thing in the side: as startups grow, they start wanting ""The Best"" hires, which often means that they have to hire people into positions of some status. But if your older employees feel promised leadership positions, and those opportunities are bargained away to new employees in order to make the best hires, you can end up with a conflict.",1332522936

3746120,comment,3744907,3744907,17,0,droithomme,,,"Taking a look at the timeline.<p>In November they fired a key employee, then the CEO demanded a loyalty oath of all remaining members that they would stay  for 6 months or get out. They had 48 hours to accept the loyalty oath or leave. All accepted.<p>It seems it was then that they began the total rewrite of the front <i>and</i> back end of the system.<p>On this last Monday, after 5 months of an unpaid overtime, they finished that complete rewrite death march. On Tuesday they had a token pizza party.<p>There is no other reward for completion of this death march or the roughly six months of loyalty.<p>On Wednesday they are back to the grind. A co-founder, having fulfilled his vow to stay through the six month rewrite, resigns. The rest of the employees are told by the CEO they must take another loyalty oath and this time be willing to work without pay because there is no income. This time they get 24 hours not 48 to answer. The entire team chooses to reject the new loyalty oath and thus ""resigns"", but it is also possible they were basically forced out for refusing the oath.<p>Even without the oath, mass resignations are quite common at the end of a death march. So far this story is straight predictable right out of Edward Yourdon. Yourdon is also correct that death marches are the rule not the exception with start ups. Given how many products and start ups are destroyed because of management driving death marches, they may in fact even be responsible for the largest waste of capital in the industry today. Business as usual though.<p>Now we get to the strange parts of the story.<p>During all this going on, the same CEO only the week before was emailing journalists and telling them that the company was doing well and picking up several hundred new customers per week.<p>The CEO then writes a letter to investors blaming the co-founder for not being loyal, doesn't mention the new loyalty oath, and goes on to say the company is in excellent shape with new customers coming in every day.<p>This is all quite strange with a number of unaddressed questions. Among them:<p>With all these new customers why was the team told to accept no pay or get out?<p>The team spent the last six months sacrificing their lives and successfully rebuilt the entire product. They succeeded. The CEO during that time period has successfully extracted only 50% of the loyalty oaths he demanded. This seems his major accomplishment. He completely failed to secure financing needed to keep the company afloat. What exactly has he been doing during this time while others sacrificed? It is clear what the developers have been doing, but him not so much.",1332522835

7608846,comment,7608485,7608724,5,0,vanderZwan,,,"Good point. I think it is because positive opinions without good reasons are perceived as encouragement (&quot;I like what you do, keep going!&quot;) instead of criticism, while negative opinions are criticism. The latter requires <i>arguments</i> to be useful as feedback. Of course, saying why you <i>do</i> like something would also make those remarks more valuable as criticism - you got a good point there.<p>(Note that I&#x27;m not saying Nathan Osullivan is necessarily wrong in his judgement - I might disagree with it but he can still have valid reasons for disliking it. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s pretty a useless remark if he gives no arguments why he has that opinion)",1397822357

You can start with 128,256, 512 and gradually move towards 2048 or even 4096.\n2)\tIt has different initial configurations. You don’t always start with empty board. Sometimes the initial boards have quite big numbers. We believe this saves people time.\n3)\tThe ability to get hint from the program. We have a great auto solver that can even reach to 16384. So the hints that app gives are great.<p>Putting these together, we believe you can learn great strategies from the program and ultimately beat 2048 easily.<p>Guys do you think this is something people would like?

7608758,comment,7601506,7607143,1,0,sparkie,,,"The fexprs provided by Kernel are not the same as the ones in traditional lisps which were abandoned - Shutt has developed a theory for reasoning about them in some ways (the vau-calculus, which is capable of defining the lambda calculus too). He describes pure and impure versions of the vau calculus in his dissertation.<p>Firstly, operatives are improved over the traditional ones by having lexical scoping - where the original lisps were dynamically scoped. The other main feature of operatives is that they gain access to the dynamic scope from where they were called - as this environment is passed implicitly to the operative when it is evaluated.<p>You&#x27;re right that they do not allow us to reason inductively about code in the same way as the lambda calculus due to this, but it&#x27;s a trade off for incredible flexibility. I think we can build alternative models to reason about them for purposes of optimisation and such. (Or alternatively, one can have operatives behave as compilers - in which you feed in type-tagged expressions, and your compiler-operatives can perform full type checking - then output an applicative which strips this type information). I see the possibilities as endless, because the model is extremely abstract.<p>Kernel choses not to enforce the static separation of operatives and applicatives for simplcity - instead, a convention based approach is used whereby operatives are prefixed with &quot;$&quot;, (such as $vau, $lambda, $define!, $provide!). One can check them during runtime with the operative? and applicative? predicates too.<p>However, it would be perfectly possible to create a compiler which can know this difference, since the forms `($define! ($vau ...))` and `($define! ($lambda ...))` which distinguish them could be given special forms or special syntax in an alternative representation of this model, although you would not be able to tell whether an applicative uses some operatives internally - that&#x27;s the idea of encapsulation - implementation information is meant to be hidden. (Even at the cost of performance, which often doesn&#x27;t matter.)<p>Even if Kernel is not as widely practical as lambda-calculus based languages - Shutt&#x27;s dissertation is definitely worth a read, and shouldn&#x27;t be discarded because of a perception of bad fexprs from 40 years ago.",1397819714

Generally, firms become insolvent if they can&#x27;t meet their liabilities <i>as they fall due</i> (things get a bit more complicated for regulated firms such as insurers, which also have to worry about solvency ratios). If a firm&#x27;s current liabilities exceed its current assets (where &#x27;current&#x27; is defined as &#x27;to be received/fall due in the next 12 months&#x27;) then it&#x27;s likely to be in trouble. Examples of current assets are cash, stock and trade debtors (i.e. other firms you have supplied to on credit), and current liabilities include trade creditors (firms who have supplied you on credit). These contrast with fixed assets and long-term liabilities, which aren&#x27;t expected to arise for over 12 months (e.g. a 5 year bank loan).<p>If firms automatically became insolvent when liabilities exceeded assets, then no one would ever be able to start a firm with a bank loan, because from day one the liabilities (loan + interest) would outstrip the assets (cash).<p>It&#x27;s also possible for a firm to have assets which exceed liabilities but still be insolvent, for example a property company with large fixed assets but little cash in the bank to meet its running costs.",1397819534

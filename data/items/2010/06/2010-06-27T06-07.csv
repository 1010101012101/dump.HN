Maybe a watchdog restart daemon process, etc. Then my understanding expanded to really consider all of this working in concert as the application, even the OS and it's configuration, and any other service dependencies. Whatever had to be a certain way, manually configured or tuned or whatever, to achieve the desired application result.<p>I think that's also where the notion of error handling comes into play because it's obvious at that level that it's not enough to just handle exceptional cases gracefully inside the body of your main program(s), and in fact, you may not want to, you may want to let certain things percolate up and cause the process to exit, if only to achieve a uniformity in how you handle edge cases.",1277621195

And letting people require trustworthy identities in frivolous contexts (equivalent to asking people to show you their driver's license at a party, or to shop at a supermarket) is a bad idea, an extremely attractive to ethically challenged marketers bad idea at that.<p>The gripping hand of course, is that we can't not do this. As a society we have set ourselves on the path where the benefits outweigh the risks, and the risks of not creating a trustworthy system of identity that does it's best to guarantee both the security of transactions (non-repudiation) and the freedoms that come with pseudo- and ano- nymity outweigh the benefits of sticking with a broken system of partial identification, where identity theft is a simple matter of copying the right strings to the right places.<p>Frankly if you read the PDF referenced in the story, it's not as bad as some of the comments in this thread seem to think it is, the people involved have obviously been reading Kim Cameron, and aren't completely at sea on the privacy issues, or the social implications.

This contrast reduction is for READ emails. Unread emails stand out really well (black on white). My guess is that designers did usability tests and found out that people are more interested in new, unread emails, than in read emails.

370901,comment,334355,334355,0,0,shortbusgeek,,,"Personally I believe a recession is the best time to start a startup.  Thinking of the amount of time and effort it takes to get a good startup going (typically), the economy could be coming out of a recession by the time you're ready to seek capital.  Sure, you'll have to bootstrap, as angel investors will be far and few between, but it's definitley do-able.<p>I've got 3 different ventures going on right now that I've been working on for 2 years, 1 year, and 6 months, respectively.  The one that's 2 years old I won't be ready for venture capital for another 2 years probably.  The one that is a year old could theoretically be ready for funding in another year, and the 6 month old I'm hoping to not even seek funding, but to just grow from the ground up into a profitable business a year from now as well.  The three somewhat interconnect and can use features of each other, which will hopefully help propel each towards success.  Either way, I'm taking advantage of the current recession as best as I can.  Pageviews are up, my alexa traffic rankings are going the right way, and revenues continue to increase.  All good signs that sometimes it's a recession that helps startups. :-)",1227209222

Let your subconscious chug away on the topic for a while; at least for a couple of weeks, if not for a couple of months. Eventually, something will bubble up that you like.<p>--- Long Version:<p>Just two days ago, I decided on a name for my startup company and app/website. It took me about 6 months, though. For the first 4 months, I was actively thinking about names, writing BASH, Ruby and Perl scripts to generate names, using websites like makewords.com and others, etc. Every name that I made either sucked, or was taken. That was pretty disheartening.<p>Eventually, I let the task of finding a name slip into the background. Every now and then, a name would bubble up from my subconscious, I'd ponder it for a few minutes, then write it down.<p>Then two nights ago, after a long coding session, I went to bed. I was tossing and turning, with my mind wandering all over the app that I'm creating. During that time, I started thinking about dinosaurs.<p>Say what?..I like dinos. They're pretty awesome!<p>After lying in bed for about 2 hours, thinking about how to integrate dinosaurs into my app, I got up and did a few whois searches. Lo and behold, most of the dino-related names that I'd just thought of were available!<p>What I'm trying to say is that naming is a very ephemeral process. You can spend 10 full days on the task, and still come out with nothing [that you like]. So if you're having trouble choosing a name, forget about it for a while.

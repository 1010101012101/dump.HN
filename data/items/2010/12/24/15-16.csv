It would have stuff like ""change text at"" and ""highlight line"" and so on. Going the other direction there would be a set of well defined events like ""text changed"" and ""do X"", and so on.<p>2. Convince tool makers to write to this api rather than a specific editor.<p>3.

You can also read-in values into the programming code in the org-file and return results to it as well.. so you could technically run your unit tests in the file and return the results in a nicely formatted org-table. :)<p>You just can't do that stuff with vim.

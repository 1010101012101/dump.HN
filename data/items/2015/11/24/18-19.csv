10622674,comment,10613814,10620150,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Identifying processes with file descriptors instead of PIDs, initially by adding a new flag to clone, CLONE_FD, that gives you back a file descriptor for the new process.  The descriptor becomes readable when the process exits, so you can manage a child process and get its status without SIGCHLD.  That allows a library to manage child processes without messing with the signal handlers of the parent process using the library.<p>Since the file descriptor holds a reference to the kernel data structure for a process (task_struct), that makes it race-free, unlike a PID (for anyone other than the parent process), and thus unlike a path within /proc (which uses the PID).  So after getting CLONE_FD in, and adding ways to use a file descriptor in place of a PID in other syscalls, I&#x27;d like to add ways to use that process file descriptor to get back information about the process instead of using /proc (such as via ioctls).<p>While there&#x27;s sadly no video available, I gave a presentation at Linux Plumbers Conference / LinuxCon that included discussion of CLONE_FD.

Curious if you have a source?<p>> Indeed, only solar flares present dangers, but they travel slowly and there will be at least a day&#x27;s notice for the crew to seek shelter. The entire spacecraft can&#x27;t be shielded from a solar flare, but a smaller part can be. That could be a room (pantry) in the centre which houses the food and water supplies, lining the outside.<p>Sure. In fact, I believe that&#x27;s the plan for Orion. This limits both the total crew capacity, their operational capability and puts further constraints on scientific and computing equipment (which can&#x27;t be easily moved).<p>> Microgravity can also be avoided at small costs by keeping the last upper stage tied to the main spacecraft with a long tether. Rotate that as a counter-weight against the main spacecraft (and the spacecraft itself) to give the crew a ground to stand on.<p>Maybe... except we&#x27;ve never built anything like that and new construction in vacuum has a way of causing interesting surprises. In the future, sure, there will be at least some microgravity generation and there are a lot of proposals but none are near-term engineering projects. What is the tether made out of? What&#x27;s your backup when it malfunctions in some fashion? Where do you get the energy to spin the weight and it&#x27;s counterweight up and down at need? Where do you get the long-duration, vacuum rated gear housing for the tether control mechanism?<p>> Manufacturing-wise, the main ingredient is a heavy-lift vehicle on the scale of Saturn 5, capable of lifting at least 100 tons to LEO, preferably 150 tons.<p>Lift vehicles are now well-known enough that corporations can build them in for-profit enterprises. That&#x27;s simple enough. With an eye to manufacturing, for long-distance space voyages, you&#x27;ve got to look at field-reparable spacecraft. This is a complete unknown for human habitable craft (though Hubble, the space stations and some of the later Gemini missions have given some sense of how that will go) out of range of resupply. There are plans but no operational experience which&#x27;ll lead to fun surprises.<p>> Life support is not insurmountable either, although we&#x27;ve seen in the past that NASA needs a better focus at estimating danger (Challenger, Columbia).<p>That... is a weird statement. There&#x27;s been no crew loss due to life support systems. Re-entry and launch vehicle mishaps yes, but not life-support.<p>The primary engineering challenge around life support is, again, we have no experience with closed ecosystems out of range of resupply. We can store food--so agriculture can be dumped, potentially--but carrying enough disposables to manufacture and recycle an atmosphere is a no-go in terms of weight. You&#x27;ve also got the challenge of illness--an inevitability over several years--which we don&#x27;t have any experience with save &quot;tough it out; it&#x27;s a short mission&quot;.<p>> You can find this and more in Zubrin&#x27;s book: &quot;A case for Mars&quot;, if you&#x27;re interested.<p>I&#x27;ve read Zubrin&#x27;s book. It&#x27;s well done but overly optimistic with regard to basic engineering challenges in a like matter to mid-50s proposals for a lunar landing. The discrepancy between those is fascinating and, when it&#x27;s all said and in the history books, will be in a like fashion to Zubrin&#x27;s book. Given present levels of technology, we&#x27;re more likely to send--in the near future and without substantial, multi-generational investment in basic R&D--something like a current-tech space station with a rocket on the ass-end of it.<p>Anything else is speculative and more akin to near-future scifi than not.",1448390987

Even in the rare case they do have that necessary understanding, they almost certainly have zero training in how to create or identify puzzles that actually align with the kinds of problem solving that match the profile they&#x27;re looking for.  The interviewer will have zero training on what to observe about how the person solves problems and what the signals actually mean.  They&#x27;ll instead almost certainly pick up all the wrong signals and miss all the important ones and interpret the ones they picked up in the wrong way.<p>Usually people tell me they ask certain kinds of puzzle or programming questions because they want to see how the person solves problems, collaborates, communicates, etc.  As a quick litmus test I always respond, &quot;When you ask these puzzle questions to your candidates do you already know the answers?&quot;  100% of the time, &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;  To which I say, &quot;If you already know the answer, you&#x27;re unable to remove your bias from the way of coming to the solution, and you&#x27;re learning absolutely nothing about how they communicate or collaborate.

Code that is not testable is not well-designed.<p>> Well designed code is properly encapsulated, does one thing, has a minimal interface and few dependencies.<p>And testing tests what the consumer of code will use, using the interface.<p>> Testable code is often less encapsulated, contains extra complexity for the test machinery, among which we can count extra methods (with potentially non-private visibility) and dependencies between classes (such as strategies, policies, factories, etc).<p>Only if you are doing testing wrong; what you should be testing, even for unit testing, is the behavior of the unit under test as provided through its exposed interfaces to consumers of the unit under test.<p>> Furthermore, while designing at the class level is important, it is much more important to architect at higher levels: component, subsystem, application, system/platform.<p>Conventional, unit-test-focused TDD is a practice isolated to a particular level which does not conflict with higher-level practices of the same type that address that concern, like Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD).",1448390654

I got phone screens on all of them, but only offers from about half.

As well, one interview I was asked a very tough bit manipulation, which I completely flunked.  Another interview I bombed because my interviewer didn&#x27;t know C/C++, and although he said I could program in any language, it was obvious he couldn&#x27;t understand what I did, and had no confidence that my solution worked, even though it did.<p>I did learn, however, that using C/C++ in interviews these days is problem, because most interviews now expect you to run these on the fly, or they ask questions that expect you to use built-in libraries that other languages already have.  I was asked at a couple of interviews to parse a CSV file, and that was a huge problem in C/C++ that would have been handled in a single line of code with python.

10622524,comment,10614526,10622306,0,0,pron,,,"> we probably should do some research by introducing programming languages to children<p>That might be a good data point, but it is hardly sufficient. One of the biggest problems of objectively evaluating languages is that many languages &quot;behave&quot; differently when the project in question is large (large team, many LOC, long expected lifetime) than when it is small. We have good reason to believe that some languages which excel at productivity when working on small projects, are actually detrimental to large ones. How well a language affects productivity of small projects is certainly important (as small projects are important as is fast prototyping), but in terms of overall significant effect on software development in the industry at large, it is large projects that are far more interesting. Sadly, testing a language on large projects is expensive (and makes using children as the test subjects completely impractical), and as a result some languages have gone completely or near-completely untested in this regard even decades after their introduction. Their benefits (or problems) are therefore often as much folklore and religious belief than anything supported by actual evidence (let alone convincing evidence).<p>This sad fact, however, is what makes arguments over languages so much fun (for some) and endless.<p>Personally, my belief is that other than some outliers, the actual effect of modern languages (say any of those made in the past thirty years or so) on large project productivity is measurable but far less significant than some would have us believe (to the point where switching languages for this important class of projects is rarely justified[1]). And when the effect is larger, it has more to do with extra-linguistic features (like GC, performance, monitorability) than any language-level abstraction. But, of course, I can&#x27;t prove it...<p>[1]: I am not suggesting languages <i>can&#x27;t</i> make a bigger impact on large-project productivity, only that the ones we currently have don&#x27;t. Indeed, more than one language has made such significant impact in the past.",1448389933

Before the refugee crisis, a growth of 40.000 people per year was expected, vs. plans to build 10.000 new apartments. The decision against developing the the abandoned Tempelhof airport only makes it worse, and shows some of the social problems in the city. Bear in mind that everybody who got to vote on the referendum already lived in Berlin:<p><i>&quot;Though about 20 per cent of the development was to be reserved for affordable housing, the locals decided to keep their expansive city oasis free of any new buildings. The rationale was that increased supply often only means more luxury dwellings and does not address affordability.&quot;</i><p>&quot;Luxury&quot; here doesn&#x27;t mean huge, it just means &quot;well built, nice kitchen, 14 EUR/m^2&quot;. It&#x27;s like saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t want anybody else to buy a car, because they might get a Mercedes, which I cannot afford.&quot;<p>The social housing system is also quite unfair, if you ask me. Social housing apartments are in regular buildings, not separated from the rest. The idea is to counter gentrification, and keep the population mixed. You are only eligible below some margin of income. So far so good, but if you work and earn one Euro too much, you need to pay twice the rent, for the exact same apartment.",1448388019

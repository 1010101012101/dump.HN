Ultimately, even though the movie takes place in the &quot;future&quot;, without the AIs you basically have Siri-style &quot;read my email&quot; or today&#x27;s cellphones. For me, the most interesting part was how natural it felt after seeing the movie to take a video call in public over LTE -- suddenly talking at my phone in my hand seemed normal (and useful!) Oh and it sounded almost as if the AIs decided it would be best for humanity if they left, I really felt it was a love story from beginning to end, and with recovery after that.

7055757,comment,7054975,7055254,9,0,rpedela,,,"Yeah I generally agree with you. My view is that mobile will follow the desktop in terms of apps. Once upon a time, most apps were native to the desktop. Then the networks got fast enough and the browsers and tools got good enough that you could build most native desktop apps as websites. Once the mobile networks get fast enough, and the mobile browsers and tools get a bit better then I think you will start seeing mobile apps being built as websites too.<p>The main problem websites solve over native is the fact you only have to build the app once and it works everywhere (mostly). Of course, there will always be a place for native apps, regardless of desktop or mobile, when performance matters most.<p>I think you are already starting to see it happen actually with mobile-first web frameworks like Bootstrap, some mobile browsers performing well (i.e. Chrome), and 4G rolling out.

They will be more confident and be important part in make everything in China better and better.<p>And it is also true that China invested more and more in education. The average quality is not that good, and the efficiency is low, but there still are big positive impact on China society in general.

I still thunk MVC and derivatives for proper object oriented environments like Smalltalk is superior as a <i>general</i> design pattern, but fusebox is a great match for web development with &quot;template oriented&quot; languages like php and cf. It builds sanely on these languages&#x27; strenghts and can be rather plesant to work with.<p>1:<p><a href""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusebox_(programming"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusebox_(programming)</a>",1389679408

As the BBC article notes glyphosate is considered one of the &quot;most environmentally friendly&quot; farm chemicals by the World Health Organisation (glyphosate breakers down in water unlike older herbicides). GMOs and Monsanto are not even mentioned in the BBC article. Your second story is a photo essay with sad pictures but very little actual information. It is much more likely if farm chemicals did cause any of these illnesses it was older pesticides that are known to be much more dangerous.<p>Do you have better evidence than this?

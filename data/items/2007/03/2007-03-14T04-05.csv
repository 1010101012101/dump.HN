For entrepreneurs with a previous failure it was 20%, and for entrepreneurs with a previous success it was 33%.<p>I suspect that the success rate is somewhat higher for bootstrapped tech startups, because you're given the option of failing and trying again with the same company, different idea.  Usually if you fail with a VC's money, they liquidate the company.  If you fail with your own, you can take the assets you have and try to redirect them to a new line of business.<p>I thought I saw another study somewhere that said that the average number of failures a bootstrapped startup goes through is 4.  That squares with the success rates for VC-funded startups above, if you assume that each failure simply means the entrepreneur tries a new idea.  You have a 18% chance of succeeding on the first try, a 33% chance of succeeding by the second try (82% * 82% = 67.24% chance of failing), a 45% chance of succeeding by the third try, and a 55% chance of succeeding by the fourth try, for an average of 3-4 attempts necessary before success.",1173847506

They could post about it and you'd probably get a lot of traffic and artists interested in signing up.<p>I also agree that going to shows and introducing yourself to bands will help. Any personal interaction like that would get me to try out the service over a junk spam message on myspace.",1173847464

It's fine when you're collaborating on documenting something that's completely objective, but as soon as you get into something controversial it descends into chaos.  There's good reason that some of the highest-quality articles on Wikipedia tend to be the ones about math.<p>Darcs/git might be a better model for this sort of thing:  everybody gets their own working copy and can merge changes made to other copies into their own.",1173846194
4055,comment,4042,4042,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I've always been pretty skeptical of the 90% number, but I don't think this article clears up the matter.  I'm assuming all of us here aren't interested in opening up a mini-mart (rather we're interested in startups in the PG definition of the word -- basically something that scales).  And yet, the ""over half"" figure that's quoted in the article I'm sure includes things like mini-marts.  And I would guess that a mini-mart business has a better chance of staying open over a year than a tech startup does.  So the ""over half"" might be inflated in the other direction. <p>Also, I wonder if companies that in reality fail before one year might just tend to wait until the next tax year comes before officially shutting it down with the government.  If so, depending on how the stats were found, this could inflate the success percentage.",1173845127

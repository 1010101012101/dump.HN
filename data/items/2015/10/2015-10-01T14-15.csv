10311570,comment,10311156,10311423,0,0,msandford,,,"But as it gets cheaper to put new satellites up, cleanup gets cheaper too.  And if access gets cheap enough I could easily see an international treaty mandating that all satellites have an EOL burnup system installed.  When 20kg costs $2mm a lot of people will balk at the idea.  When 20kg costs $200k or $20k it&#x27;s a lot easier to require people to include it.  It could even be a bolt-on kind of thing, separately powered and controlled such that it doesn&#x27;t have to be re-invented for every new satellite.<p>Also with access being cheap enough we could start doing active cleanup, beyond just not making the problem worse.  Aerogel is supposed to be great for capturing particles because it&#x27;s basically frozen air.  We could build a space-based aerogel factory and ship silicon ingots up which then get turned into aerogel panels to be used as replenishable armor for the factory.  And once you have the factory up you just start making the area that the armor sweeps bigger and bigger.  Build out sideways to clear a particular orbit faster, build up or down to clear orbits of various heights.  It&#x27;d be insanely expensive right now, but if launch costs come down to $100/kg or $10/kg it starts to look reasonable.",1443711563

It is needed for a service that routes traffic like a VPN, but netscans, e.g. 175.123.54.0/24 whereas 175.123.54.1, 175.123.54.2, 175.123.54.3, .. are scanned for :5900 (VNC), :110 (pop3), .., shall be prevented and actively blocked.<p>My current solution includes hooking libpcap, having a LRU-ring for connections whereas each entry has a TTL of 5 seconds and consists of 1) first 24 bits of the IPs and 2) the target port (for detecting whether a subnet is scanned for a specific port, et al.). When a specific threshold is reached, e.g. subnet+port counter > 30 in lte 5 seconds, the subnet is banned. If the subnet is whitelisted, it will not be banned when a netscan was detected.<p>However - before I start over engineering that solution - is anyone aware of a solution that already implements preventing outgoing network scans?<p>Thanks",1443711486

10311543,comment,10310628,10310713,0,0,icu,,,"Hi, I can only speak to reasons why from a UK perspective, however it may still be applicable in a wider geographical sense:<p>1) To have a holistic, financial plan.<p>What I mean by this term is a truly comprehensive understanding a client&#x27;s motivations, aspirations, hopes and dreams for their life and providing a plan on how to achieve this.  Ultimately this approach comes from the belief that your money is there to help you live the life that you want.  This holistic approach will encompasses all areas: protection, retirement, investment, savings, mortgage, tax, long-term care and inheritance.  Not taking a holistic approach means that you miss out on the synergy offered when structuring a client&#x27;s affairs with complementary financial products.<p>2) To ensure that your financial plan is appropriate for your current and future circumstances.<p>What I mean by that is that each client is different and that I believe there is no &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; approach.  Your plan should take into account your current arrangements, life&#x27;s goals, attitude to risk and capacity for loss. The last two items are very important because some clients are risk adverse and as an adviser you must take this into consideration when you consider how best to reach their life&#x27;s goals.  For example if a client wants a pension income of x, and you can achieve that goal with less risk (and therefore less returns), then it may be appropriate not to chase &#x27;market returns&#x27; for that client.<p>3) Access to specialist tools and knowledge.<p>For example we use psychographic risk profiling from Oxford University.  In conjunction with that we use stochastic modelling for efficient frontier analysis of a client&#x27;s entire portfolio and lifetime cash flow modelling tools.  I would suggest that these tools, while absolutely essential to creating a good holistic plan, are out of reach for most retail investors.  Furthermore there are many financial products that may be appropriate for a retail investor within a wider portfolio, but they are simply not marketed to the wider retail market (intermediaries only).  One last point, we have a team that includes several domain experts covering different areas such as tax and pension transfers.  I highly doubt that a typical retail client would understand, keep up with, and be capable of legally mitigating their tax.<p>UK Regulation Has Raised Standards<p>Post the UK regulator&#x27;s (Financial Conduct Authority or FCA) shake up of the adviser market with the Retail Distribution Review (RDR), huge changes have occurred in how advice is given.  Part of this is that from the beginning of next year commission from financial products will be switched off and adviser/product charging must be completely transparent.  If UK advisers were to carry out the self-serving advice offered by US &quot;advisers&quot; they would fall foul of UK regulation and face huge fines and a ban from the industry.<p>Another interesting point is that the FCA now require evidence of ongoing servicing of a client or an adviser will be forced by the regulator to hand back all remuneration paid by the client to the adviser.  Quite frankly if you are not demonstrating value to a client for the fee you charge you will likely loose the client anyway.<p>Closing Thoughts<p>Good financial advisers in the UK have already switched over to fee based business models many years ago and have been in line with best practice anyway.  Raising the minimum standards, while painfully implemented by the regulator, has ultimately been good for clients who can afford advice.  Unfortunately there have been unintended consequences and as a result it has made advice more expensive and inaccessible (that is another story).<p>Finally I would say that yes, there are bad advisers out there and you should be cautious.  However there are good ones out there too and I truly believe in the value proposition that a holistic approach offers to clients.",1443711325

You can have all the skills in the world, but sometimes you need fate (or whatever you want to call it) to fall in your favour.<p>A small example, not related to this, but when I started DJing about 15 years ago, I put on a party that was a warm-up party for a bigger night.  I told John Digweed (who was running the bigger party) about it.  John Digweed was one of the worlds biggest DJs at that point, and as &#x27;luck&#x27; would have it he was releasing a new mix CD.  So the world&#x27;s music press was there to interview him.<p>He came down to my party with the world&#x27;s press and suddenly my first ever party was in magazines across the globe.  I started getting offers of gigs all over the world after that.  There were much better DJs around (I was pretty average back then), but I&#x27;d had the stroke of luck which ended up in a pretty successful &#x27;career&#x27; (I put it in quotes because I always treated it as a hobby, but by most people&#x27;s measurements it was pretty successful).<p>Knowledge and skill is obviously important, but luck definitely plays a role, especially when it comes to areas of life that very few succeed in.",1443711157

When a page requests the cached resource, the owner &#x27;returns&#x27; the resource with a delay of whatever the original access time was, fudged around by some noise.<p>A weakness of this would be that websites would be able to &#x27;communicate&#x27; with each other by engineering response times to your browser, and then checking how long it takes your browser to access that. But this is a different scenario than random websites trying to figure out where else you&#x27;ve been: here the pages need to be in collusion with each other.<p>The servers might try to use fancy algorithms to try to figure out if you&#x27;re using cached versions by hitting different distributed servers and figuring out if the resource load time is an outlier. But that&#x27;s prone to a lot of noise and other issues, and lesser of an issue than the original concern. Right?<p>This obviously won&#x27;t help with page load speeds, but will help network load for bot users and servers. One possible issue might be: if you&#x27;ve been in a slow connection previously, all your connections will seem slow even after you are in a faster connection. For that, you can just purge the cache and force the browser to reload the 
resources.<p>Edited for formatting.",1443710551

Hence, the person putting a link to a &quot;web at large&quot; resource in, or the platform on which such link is published, caries the burden to keep the link working.

No, there is absolutely no consensus on this.  This approach is only
popular with researchers who pray at the church of lambda.
Essentially all programming languages that are not research prototypes
and that are used in industrial practise don&#x27;t follow this approach.
There are valid reasons for this.  A much better approach in my
opinion is to start with an unrestricted, effectful language and identify fragments with fewer effects via types. The problem is that adding interesting effects effects on top of something super restricted like pure functions leads to a high &quot;encoding tax&quot;. That&#x27;s because pure functions are not very expressive.<p><pre><code>     Why did type inference become the #1 criterion for a type system

We have been talking about large-scale software engineering, and
whether Curry-Howard or program logic is a more scalable approach
towards program verification. My claim is that in large-scale software
engineering the single most important criterion is to minimise the
cost of change. Type-inference has 0 cost of change, since it&#x27;s fully
automatic. I cannot see how a verification tool that I&#x27;m forced to use
in prototype phases when there is no stable specification is
cost-effective in large-scale software engineering.<p><pre><code>     There are far more important criteria than type inference, such
     as expressiveness.
</code></pre>
Sheer expressiveness is not interesting. You can produce trivial
typing systems where every program is typable. What really matters is
to find &quot;sweetspots&quot; between the following desirable features of
typing systems.<p>- Expressiveness.<p>- Strength of properties guaranteed by typing.<p>- Speed (including decidability) of type-checking or type-inference.<p>Unfortunately there are hard trade-offs between them.<p><pre><code>     Doing type inference for non HM-typeable parts of programs is
     theoretically simple.
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s that simple to do it well, and people do publish
in this area, see for example the Trellys project by Vilhelm Sjöberg.
I think it&#x27;s an unsolved problem. It may be possible to get a
pragmatically viable system that combines proving and programming in a
unified system, but we are not there yet, and whether the result is
superior to, or on par with simple programming languages and an
associated logic can only be considered when such a language is
available. And note that work like Sjöberg&#x27;s is about combining <i>pure
functional programming</i> with constructive logic in one system. Even if
some kind of polished Haskell with dependent types can be build,
whether that then generalises to state, concurrency, timing etc in a clean way is
another open question.<p><pre><code>     I would also suggest that your experience may not yet have been

In 1980 Reagan campaigned on lifting Carter&#x27;s grotesque grain embargo to the USSR, one of many pinpricks he made after they invaded Afghanistan and mightily embarrassed him.",1443708980

In some places, the law imposes minimum standards on what is acceptable in a consumer (or even business) transaction, and software companies have tried to play the &quot;But the EULA says...&quot; card, and if it&#x27;s actually tested in court they have sometimes lost. They often rely on people not being aware of their rights and/or not having the time or money or willpower to contest the issue.<p>Even that barrier may not help the software companies in the long run. Coincidentally, just today the UK introduced a sort of lightweight version of US class action lawsuits as part of a major revision of consumer protection law, as well as various other explicit consumer rights relating to digital rather than physical content.<p><i>I would not be surprised by a world where only specialists (developers, graphic designers etc) have desktops and the actual majority of computers in use are locked down iOS or Android kiosk type devices.</i><p>I&#x27;m afraid that is one all too realistic possibility.

I don&#x27;t think general purpose computers are going anywhere any time soon.<p>Perhaps more significantly, there is now a push in quite a few places to promote computer literacy and basic programming skills even at school age, and to spread the word that you <i>can</i> still tinker and make cool stuff, perhaps using devices like the Raspberry Pi and Arduino. We also have Linux and the FOSS community following a similar philosophy on the software side, of course, and actually one of the nicer results of so many kids having smartphones these days is that writing simple apps to run on them is now an attractive introduction to programming for kids who enjoy playing with technology. Ultimately, there is a strong human instinct to create and many people enjoy making stuff that is fun and interesting, and fortunately no amount of marketing is ever likely to change that.<p>Dumbed-down, locked-in devices may be the majority in the future, but I think there will always be room for powerful, flexible tools and there will always be room for innovation and creativity.

But the investors already own those assets, so investment management fees should really be based on what investors are getting in the returns that managers produce. Calculated correctly, as a percentage of returns, fees no longer look low. Do the math. If returns average, say, 8% a year, then those same fees are not 1% or one-half of 1%. They are much higher — typically over 12% for individuals and 6% for institutions...<p>Thus (correctly) stated, management fees for active management are remarkably high.

Mutual funds are one instrument that may be used for the equity side of the investments. If you are thinking that FA means active vs. passive/index funds then read on.<p>The one thing you absolutely can control when investing is costs. Low cost index funds put you in a more advantageous position right out of the gate which means more money available to compound over time.<p>Do some managed funds or advisors beat the low cost index funds? Yes, but they cost more and you have to be fortunate enough to pick the one who beats. Keep in mind the one who beats also often changes year to year so you&#x27;re stuck rolling the dice over and over.<p>Personally, instead of spending time researching which managed funds may do better than the rest I focus on companies instead. I have a small % of my portfolio in a brokerage account where I can directly invest in companies and ETFs that I think may do well.",1443708612

But when they got the licence they tracked down every copy of VAXSYMA and demanded the org stop using it and return/destroy all of the IP.  And while I&#x27;m not familiar with the long term history of Macsyma at Symbolics, there&#x27;s lots of talk about the reluctance of those outside its unit to sell or push it on non-Symbolics Lisp Machine platforms.  As far as I know, it wasn&#x27;t available for LMI&#x27;s LAMBDA or TI&#x27;s Explorer, although perhaps that changed as Symbolics&#x27; fortunes declined.<p>My reading on Danny&#x27;s take on Symbolics comes from when I was working for LMI in the September 1982 to June 1983 period.  Due to the ADL/Symbolics single source licencing scam (which also, I&#x27;ll note, cut out Joel Moses, the &quot;father&quot; of it and others, something he was still unhappy about at the end of the &#x27;80s), he didn&#x27;t want to buy from Symbolics, and asked me if there was any chance LMI could deliver in the time frame he needed for the founding of Thinking Machines, which was incorporated in 1993.<p>I regretfully had to tell him there was no way that would happen (success was not even in the picture until I recruited a <i>extremely</i> talented classmate right after he graduated in 1983), so they bought ~6 3600s to get the company off the ground (in part limited by the power available in their interim Watham office), and as you note, it was one of the front ends you could buy for the original formula Connection Machines (in black trade dress to fit with their stunning industrial design).  Understandably, he wasn&#x27;t willing to give up on his Comnection Machine dream because of Symbolics&#x27;s behavior at that time.<p><i>Stallman was reading other people&#x27;s mails and he was threatening to sabotage other people, wasn&#x27;t he?</i><p>&quot;Everybody&quot; read other&#x27;s emails, Joel Moses&#x27; was particularly fascinating.  Of course there was an ethos about what you&#x27;d do with that information, and one I can see RMS violating.<p>But the only sabotage rumor I heard was WRT to a conflict he was said to have with Dan Weinreb.  As the story went, on the basis of a technical dispute WRT to the Lisp Machine&#x27;s software, RMS threatened to not only delete all live copies of this bit of Dan&#x27;s code, but also their copies on backup tapes.  Dan&#x27;s response was to accept a job in Livermore, CA to work on the ambitious S-1 project (this looks good, just skimmed a bit of it: <a href=""https://forum.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/S1_project"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forum.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/S1_project</a>), which had very strong connections with this MIT community (the Chaosnet actually extended all the way over to it, I forget which is which, the other end was the most geographically east node in the MIT EECS machine room, one Trantor, the other Terminus), and for example GCC started with a failed port of its Pastel compiler.<p>When Dan returned, he flatly denied the rumor, and I found him credible, especially since threatening to mess with ITS backup tapes like that was a cardinal sin.<p>Lessor methods of sabotage, certainly obstruction, would certainly fit with RMS&#x27;s style, but I can&#x27;t remember hearing of any significant examples.  And I&#x27;ll note his response to all this craziness was to do GNU/the FSF, which was ideologically aggressive, but otherwise constructive.  We are, after all, people who <i>make</i> things, not destroy them.<p>Note on my (claimed) credibility: I was on first name business with all of the people I&#x27;ve named in this post, was even a roommate of RMS when he launched the GNU Project.",1443708236

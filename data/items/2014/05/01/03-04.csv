7678150,comment,7677758,7678047,5,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"Precisely. This may sound pedantic or academic, but in practice when static overloading and dynamic dispatch differ, the static behavior is usually not what you want. In my experience, this makes it painful to make code that is polymorphic in multiple arguments behave correctly in C++ (double dispatch [1] is one of the necessary but awkward tactics that&#x27;s used), whereas multiple dispatch just works. And of course, almost working and actually working are a world apart even though they sound so close.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lostechies.com/derekgreer/2010/04/19/double-dispatch-is-a-code-smell/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lostechies.com/derekgreer/2010/04/19/double-dispatch-...</a>",1398916766

For example, &quot;Setting up a dev environment takes a day.  Sometimes you need one in a minute, like if you&#x27;re interviewing somebody and need them to demonstrate coding ability on a company laptop.  We turn any browser window into a fully-functional dev environment, and it&#x27;s as ephemeral as the browser window is, so if you close it the company laptop is back in its original state without requiring a sysadmin to wipe it and start over.  Next applicant gets a new browser window.  Is everyone clear on why a dev environment which doesn&#x27;t take 2 days to set up or tear down is a useful thing to have?  Great!  Would you like me to talk about who is willing to pay serious money for this, or do you want to hear what special sauce goes into making this Just Work for your favorite programming stack?&quot;<p>My guess is that even technically inclined people connect to that more than &quot;OK, so we have cloud-based virtualization technology which spins up ephemeral application containers then hooks them to a proprietary in-browser IDE and shell prompt.

The trailer looks amazing as well.<p>Also- I would strongly encourage people to also look at Aaron&#x27;s writing on making Wikipedia better (which has profound consequences for the internet)\n<a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/whowriteswikipedia</a><p>====<p>So did the Gang of 500 actually write Wikipedia? Wales decided to run a simple study to find out: he counted who made the most edits to the site. “I expected to find something like an 80-20 rule: 80% of the work being done by 20% of the users, just because that seems to come up a lot. But it’s actually much, much tighter than that: it turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just .7% of the users … 524 people. … And in fact the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.” The remaining 25% of edits, he said, were from “people who [are] contributing … a minor change of a fact or a minor spelling fix … or something like that.”<p>====\nCurious and skeptical, I decided to investigate. \n====<p>I purchased some time on a computer cluster and downloaded a copy of the Wikipedia archives. I wrote a little program to go through each edit and count how much of it remained in the latest version.† Instead of counting edits, as Wales did, I counted the number of letters a user actually contributed to the present article.<p>If you just count edits, it appears the biggest contributors to the Alan Alda article (7 of the top 10) are registered users who (all but 2) have made thousands of edits to the site. Indeed, #4 has made over 7,000 edits while #7 has over 25,000. In other words, if you use Wales’s methods, you get Wales’s results: most of the content seems to be written by heavy editors.<p>But when you count letters, the picture dramatically changes: few of the contributors (2 out of the top 10) are even registered and most (6 out of the top 10) have made less than 25 edits to the entire site. In fact, #9 has made exactly one edit — this one! With the more reasonable metric — indeed, the one Wales himself said he planned to use in the next revision of his study — the result completely reverses.<p>I don’t have the resources to run this calculation across all of Wikipedia (there are over 60 million edits!), but I ran it on several more randomly-selected articles and the results were much the same. For example, the largest portion of the Anaconda article was written by a user who only made 2 edits to it (and only 100 on the entire site). By contrast, the largest number of edits were made by a user who appears to have contributed no text to the final article (the edits were all deleting things and moving things around).",1398916175

Second I think the author conflates the success of &quot;design&quot; with the success of Square which is a big mistake because if you really study Square&#x27;s success it is a fantastic case study for the success of design. AFAIK Intuit launched a similar product and service with a single UX designer on a large dedicated staff well before Square launched. Square&#x27;s intense focus on design trounced Intuit with a product and service based at least partially on superior design and UX. I think the author also slips his assumptions past the audience at the beginning of the article stating that design has won it&#x27;s “a seat at the table” which is highly contextual and in general may still be less true than the author makes the case for. While design may not be batting last anymore it most certainly almost never bats first.<p>In my opinion Daniel Rosenberg offers a more scathing and valuable critique of today&#x27;s design scene in his IXDA 2014 talk &quot;The De-intellectualization of Design&quot; [1].

The larger point is that in the aggregate, there are enough individual situations that would be disrupted by jammers in the theatre that it would outweigh the nexus between the number of times someone is going to be inconvenienced by a conversation during a movie and the number of times someone is actually rude enough to pick up the phone during a movie. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a cost-benefit analysis.<p>If a movie theatre did in fact install jammers each parent concerned about their kid (yea, it&#x27;s probably not a true emergency, but subjective perception matters) or each doctor (I&#x27;m thinking more about delivering babies, which can mean being on call for weeks at a time, than an ER doctor) might choose to skip the movie. The end result is that that the theatre will likely take a hit on their profits. That&#x27;s not a compelling reason to invest in installing a jammer.<p>The whole &quot;we survived just fine without constant connectivity&quot; argument is flawed.

When you&#x27;re on-call, your life is seriously curtailed. You can&#x27;t drink, you have to be within range of tools to do your work, you have to be immediately accessible. Being on-call sucks, but it&#x27;s no reason to argue against passive signal blocking in theatres.<p>As for the babysitter, deal with it. If you&#x27;re not contactable for 90 minutes, you&#x27;re not contactable for 90 minutes. This perma-connectivity is an entirely new phenomenon, and there&#x27;s no absolute need for it. Essentially this argument is saying that the parent&#x27;s inability to deal with lack of connectivity is a convenience which trumps the general theatre-going public&#x27;s convenience of not having people talking on the phone, or who light up the people behind them because they&#x27;re bored with the movie and are playing online.<p>Being uncontactable for a short period is not the horror that it&#x27;s made out to be in these arguments. The good old argument that someone can&#x27;t sit through a lecture without connectivity &quot;in case Auntie Mabel dies&quot;, but of course it&#x27;s just a cover for having phone access for other things. If one were to believe the excuses that get trotted out, you&#x27;d be forgiven for thinking that human mortality had skyrocketed since the public acceptance of mobile phones :)",1398913258

People aren&#x27;t rational.  They don&#x27;t store &quot;just what they can afford to lose and no more&quot; in a webwallet, apparently.<p>You could counter that by saying &quot;Oh, those are just drug addicts.  Normal people aren&#x27;t that dumb.&quot;  To that, I can point at the example of the Mt. Gox collapse.  There you have a case of people going from millionaire status to &quot;looks like I&#x27;ll have to find a job and keep it for a long time&quot; status in the blink of an eye.  One of the bigger losses was 4,700 BTC: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1yv26o/gox_horror_story_thread_how_much_did_you_lose"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1yv26o/gox_horror_s...</a><p>And lastly, you can&#x27;t have it both ways.  Either Coinbase is trustworthy enough to keep your personal savings safe, or it&#x27;s insane to trust them with any amount of money that you care about not-vanishing.",1398913214

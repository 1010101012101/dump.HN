No. Resources are fairly assigned based on need, and everyone at the company realizes that.<p>I should also point out that most senior devs do have laptops in my experience.

It turns out having a dog not on a leash is a Class C Misdemeanor, but it's one of those sorts of laws that even locals don't know about because it's only enforced against people they want to enforce it against. So for a Class C Misdemeanor, which is a pretty serious crime, you have to be booked. At the time I was carrying a US passport which the locals decided was not a valid form of ID, so I was held without bail or hearing until trial. I managed to get word to an attorney I trusted, he had to come in from the other side of the state, and was able to negotiate with the district attorney to allow me to be free until trial by threatening to file a Habeas Corpus. My attorney also acquired from one of my family members a folder with my credentials and newspaper articles and other citations about my company and work, which he laid out for the local authorities there which suggested the possibility of deep embarrassment in the media if they continued with this nonsense. When I returned for trial the charges were rendered ""Nolle Prosequi"", which means the charges are not dismissed and you're not acquitted or convicted, but you're free to go until they decide to bring you back in, it's sometimes used as a sort of a warning you are not welcome.<p>This sort of routine, being rousted and brought in on some bogus charges that are never applied to whites, is a common experience among non-model minorities in the USA.

Yes, browsers are async in the sense that your code gets invoked by the browser as events occur. But once your client code gets control, it nearly always proceeds in a completely synchronous fashion. If all you're doing is changing a few dom elements in response to a button click, that happens quickly and all is well, but woe betide if you need to do some long-running computation in the browser... what are you going to do? Build your own event loop with setInterval and chop things up into short-running pieces? That's certainly uncommon. So client-side JS programmers typically don't have much experience with organizing their own code asynchronously, and the learning curve for doing so is still steep.<p>(There is of course one big exception to what I'm saying, namely communicating with the server via XHR. But not so big that it teaches you how to write a complex program in a non-blocking asynchronous style.)",1298873713

Never `rm <i>`, especially `-rf`. If you must, `rm -rf ../tmp/</i>` or similar. You do not want this command to be in your history. Especially in the form `rm -rf * & cd; trn`.<p>2. Set up backups early on. Use `git` or similar for as much as possible.<p>3. `noclobber` (or not setting CLOBBER in zsh) may help. I found `noclobber` irritating because it also refused to append to nonexistent files.<p>4. Take three deep breaths after typing and before executing a `shutdown` or `rm -r` command, or typing a password at a password prompt. (Did you just give your intranet server password to whoever has backdoored your weekend-project VPS?)<p>5. Keep backups in a format that you can readily verify is usable. `rsync` with `--link-dest` is handy for this, as is `git`.<p>6. When referring to a directory that you believe exists, don't say `foo/bar/baz`. Say `foo/bar/baz/.` so that whatever command doesn't try to create the directory `baz` if it doesn't exist yet.<p>7. Color-coded prompts or terminal windows by server.<p>8. Tab-complete to ensure that things exist.<p>9. Use `sudo` instead of root shells.<p>10. Keep your config files in source control.

Then again not very many say what a technical degree really teaches you either.  Funny system.<p>Pure liberal arts programs are interesting structures on their own.  Can you name a high school student who thinks, ""you know, I want to improve my reading, writing, and reasoning skills and for this reason I will spend 4 years in a Liberal Arts program taking a mostly random stream and number of unrelated courses.""",1298873099

In 2008 John McCain's platform included a migration away from employer coverage by treating benefits as taxable income, while simultaneously granting a refundable tax credit for the purchase of individual insurance. Obama and the Democrats instantly demagogued that as ""taking away your existing coverage"" and defended the employer-based system.",1298872914

Showing the three-level branch hierarchy of your repository doesn't seem to tell me a great story about what it's like to be a dev at MS. Not because there's anything wrong with the branch structure; if you work at a place where coders are given a lot of liberty and freedom, there should be more interesting things to talk about.<p>I guess those can be counted as special cases and not pertaining to day-to-day working. The main point to gain from the post it seems is that its not a pain to work in such a complex environment.

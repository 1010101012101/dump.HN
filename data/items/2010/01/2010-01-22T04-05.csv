1069155,comment,1067421,1068556,0,0,PieSquared,,,"Aurgh! Your comment is on one hand something I really want to respond to, yet on the other hand difficult for me to respond to well.<p><i>> At a higher education level (say College on up) I would be strongly inclined to agree with you. Give the students freedom and they will make the right choices for themselves, and they will be the only ones to live with it if they don't.
> At the basic education level (high school and below), this is precisely when society is teaching its children what it needs to continue its culture.</i><p>Background: I am in high school.<p>Anyway, I've come up against this barrier so much and it drives me crazy. Here, like in most American high schools, society isn't teaching us anything. It's teaching us to hate the 'mandatory' subjects, because everyone has to take them, and thus the teachers can't teach it well because 3/4 of their classes are utterly uninterested. To be honest, I despise my world history class. And it's not because it's history - I'm fine with history, in face, I enjoy learning about it. It's because it's <i>mandatory</i>, which means <i>everyone</i> takes it, so in the end, everyone suffers.<p>With the AP level course system that exists in the USA, you're taking  college-level courses in high school. Why should high school students have to suffer any more than college students?<p>> Most students at this age do not have the knowledge they need to make informed decisions about what they should learn, and moreover society has a vested interest in ensuring that its young people meet certain minimums.<p>This is even harder to argue with, because of the ""most"". I guess it's that old argument: would you rather allow the more gifted to excel, or everyone be held at the same level (with that level being slightly higher than had you went with the other option)? And, honestly, it isn't 'society' - society isn't doing anything. It's the school system, a bureaucratized administration incapable of seeing the system from the students perspective and incapable of creating a true institution of learning in which the students who <i>want</i> to learn at a decent rate <i>can</i>.<p>Ugh, sorry for this rant. It's just been bothering me for the past two years, because high school is <i>so goddamn constrained and mandatory</i> it's angering. Instead of learning, I have to sit through things I already know and listen to incompetent teachers talk about irrelevant topics.<p>I guess I should add something related to the original topic. I speak two languages fluently, and learned Spanish in high school for four years, then promptly dropped it. Why? Because even though I live in an area with easily 30% Spanish-speakers, I don't ever need to use it. Ever! And if I try to practice it, the Spanish-speakers would just rather speak English, because a lot of them are more comfortable talking to me in English. My point: in almost all places in the USA, other languages are useless. Now, in my own time, outside of school, I've learned some Portuguese, because I play capoeira and my instructor and students learning it along with me speak it all the time. My second point: when you need to, you will learn a language.",1264136290

It was good stuff, but very difficult for anyone else to understand. He ended up leaving the company, and I inherited the front end code base. The project got put on hold for a while, and we decided to take a fresh start. I went with Jquery UI rather than ExtJS, because it just felt too much like you had to drink the kool-aid with ExtJS. Our team was more comfortable with a hybrid approach.<p>Every form we write is in bare bones partial HTML, and we use some juiced up JQuery UI Dialog code to display the forms as modal pop-ups. Additionally, we use the UI themes and their css classes even for non-JQuery Ui components, that way when we switch themes, all the elements change, not just the JQuery UI ones.

Certainly, I cannot find such a loop.<p>On the question of whether it is a constant factor optimization, though, it rather depends on the relative costs of following a link versus the bookkeeping accounting for steps taken. Empirically tested in a simple program, teleporting turtle (TT) is slower than tortoise and hare (TH) when simply following linked lists in adjacently laid out in memory. When retrieving a link is made more costly, TT pulls ahead. I cannot find any scenario where TT follows more links than TH, only less or equal.<p>So it seems that following links is the thing that is being optimized for, which makes sense for finding loops in PRNGs and similar problems: you want to optimize to reduce the number of links taken.

Clearly Java and C# had whole corporations' marketing departments behind them, so that probably didn't hurt.  Ruby and Python made ""Perl sucks so you should program in us instead"" in to a successful mantra (you know what they say about repeating a lie often enough..).<p>Clojure and Scala don't really have the same things going for them, but they are buzzword compliant, mixing OO, functional programming, and the JVM together.  Programmers hear that and it sounds sexy, so they jump on board.<p>Now the question becomes more of whether that initial buzz can be converted in to long-term success for the language, which depends less on language features than on the language's community and on further marketing (which, of course, may depend on having ""killer apps"" and what companies, projects, and personalities they can get on board).",1264133541

It's building on the Kindle's strength. Anyone who is choosing e-ink over a more general purpose LCD/OLED tablet is definitely in it for the text. For developers it seems like potentially a very easy platform to work with if your primary concern is simply formatting & displaying text. As a result I bet we'll see an entirely different set of applications making the Kindle a unique platform. It's a very smart move by Amazon. Sell books on paper, sell them on the iPhone, sell them on PCs, sell them on tablets -- but keep the e-ink market of serious readers locked up for themselves.",1264133462

""unsafePerformIO"" violates purity, type safety, and half a dozen other semantics as well. It is not part of the language standard, and requires special compiler flags and pragmas to use. Its use (except in FFI) is heavily discouraged, and often involves a proof of correctness to prevent its ""unsafe-ness"" from leaking.",1264133183

The argument to do with religion wasn't directed at me, and so it felt out of place. She was also, understandably, a bit 'politically correct' in her speech and answers. But all in all, pretty good.

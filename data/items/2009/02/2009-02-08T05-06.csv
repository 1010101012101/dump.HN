When I am using a book for reference I want to be able to see it and my screen at the same time (not the book on my screen).<p>Interestingly, I think that if I buy an ebook reader I will read more for leisure as well.<p>From where I sit, the EVDO on the Kindle is appealing (esp since I hear it has some RSS capabilities). However, the PDF support seems frustrating.<p>Hopefully the original Kindle will see a drastic price drop (even if only on ebay).  That way I can see if I like it without spending so much money.

The reality is this: If the client’s browser or the server’s infrastructure is compromised than there’s no security measure that will prevent a system from being compromised.  Think about it.

When I was a kid, people went to church, but it didn't spill over into everyday life.  They did it more as a matter of form.  Now people's conversation is filled with religious references.  Someone who 30 years ago would have said ""we have two children"" now says ""we've been blessed with two children.""",1234071694

 Imagine someone makes a critical statement about your personal character, The way we respond to it is obviously different from a generic statement. Whether or not, one tries to look at the statement as it is, there is usually also a powerful psychological response which is triggered and this will too often also be the basis for action. As one forms various identities, conversations about these new topics will lead to the same response.<p>The interesting question is how is this 'minimizing of identity' to be done? One idea i've heard is the following, Usually this psychological response happens in the background, the unconscious so to speak, Instead one can be try to be aware of it, not just abstractly but live.

It can't be entirely based on pure logic but if it is useful and leads to new and interesting things then who cares...<p>Even if it succeeded in removing a lot of the crap around a debate and focus precisely on the points that people differ on so they can be attacked directly I think that would be a useful thing.<p>My idea for making this somewhat enjoyable and stand a chance of people participating in it would be to make it game like in some way.<p>Anyway, its all pretty out there stuff I know, but I'll no doubt continue to think about anyway...",1234071257

471876,comment,471777,471777,0,0,sam_in_nyc,,,"Not too many.  If they don't I just use Dapper, and then Yahoo Pipes if needed.<p>Amazing ""hack"" about Yahoo Pipes... they block usage based on an IP accessing a pipe.  Yet, you can make that pipe access the ""singleton"" version of itself many times.  So let's say you want to pull up Delicious tags of 10,000 URLs (something I did to generate very nice marketing data), you could access Delicious yourself 10,000 times (and get blocked very soon) or you can access a pipe (which accesses Delicious) 10,000 times... or you can access a pipe 100 times, each time sending it 100 URLs, and that pipe will just loop through and do it (Yahoo will count 1 access against you rather than 100).  Since there are loads of pipes servers, and it's a semi-trusted source (in this case very trusted, since Yahoo owns Delicious), not all the Yahoo pipes servers will get blocked by Delicious.  Actually, at the rate I was pinging them, some of them did actually get blocked :)<p>Another interesting experiment:  Make a Dapper App which contacts Yahoo Pipes for an RSS.  Make that Yahoo Pipe access the same Dapper App.  Fun!",1234070968

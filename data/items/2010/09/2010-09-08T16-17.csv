So I'm not sure what he's talking about with the $10/gram thing being some benchmark that's lasted decades.<p>I know that's anecdotal evidence, but it's the shared experience of every smoker or ex-smoker I've ever known. And considering the wide variations of produce quality, I think it's odd to suggest that prices are tied to any sort of specific weight.<p>It's like saying, ""Fish always costs $x per pound.

It's cosmetic, not functional, like putting perfume on a pig.""<p>I have been in many situations with Class A office space, private offices, catered team-building breakfasts and lunches, etc., etc., etc. and was ready to jump out the window.  Why?  Because the work sucked and all the window dressing in the world wasn't going to change that.<p>Then I think back to some of my most favorite projects and remember the great work that we did.  Sometimes in squalor-like conditions, sharing cubicles or tables, sitting in the server room with too much air conditioning or in the warehouse without enough, eating vending machine garbage and drinking old coffee because that was all there was.<p>Bottom line?  The <i>work itself</i> is 100 times more important than the working conditions.  Sure, everything being equal, I'd rather have nicer digs.  But everything not being equal, I'll choose the better project every time, no matter what the environment is like.<p>I suspect Joel gives the programming environment more credit than it deserves.  His people are probably happy, and the office helps.  But the real reason is the work itself, and they'd be almost as happy no matter what the office was like.",1283964961

When I started developing the site, I did not give much thought to dealing with user uploaded photos. I simply saved them to directory on the server and resized them into the correct sizes at upload time.<p>However, when the site became bigger, photos actually became a bit of a pain in the butt:<p>* Its a pain to synchronise across multiple servers<p>* If you change the sizes of the photos in your templates you need to regenerate all the images to the new size (hoping you kept the originals!)<p>* A web server set up to serve images efficiently is different to one set up to serve dynamic HTML efficiently. Running two web servers with limited resources can be a pain.<p>Of course, most of these go away by using something like Amazon S3. However, you still have the problem of making sure your images are available in the right sizes, file format conversion etc.<p>I propose a cloud based service to make this all easier for developers. Something that allows you to use a simple HTTP API to post images to. You can then request the image back in whatever size you want. Other image process functions could be supported (e.g. cropping, black and white, saturation) etc...<p>So say, you save an image to the service with file name 'image1', you could form a url to apply these changes:<p>http://fictional-image-sevice.com/myaccount/image1?crop(50,50,600,400)&size(300,200)&black_and_white&format(jpg)<p>Would return a cropped, resized black and white version of the source image as a JPG (regardless of original file format).<p>This would remove the headache of having to worry about image resizing or processing.<p>It would be a low cost service. It would use amazon s3, so storage and bandwidth would be the same. It would simply charge a fee per 1000 image requests.<p>(Really simple) client libraries would be available in all popular languages.<p>I have a really fast implementation of this image 'proxy' written in node.js that can handle these transformations, and caches the results in memory and then disk to speed it up. So it would be fast. Eventually it may be possible to offer a geo-aware version that downloads from a local server.<p>Any legs?",1283964027

Some specific regions will behave differently, of course (like your suburb and my hometown).<p>As for the cost of hamburger, your dollar figure comparisons are irrelevant. I never disputed that green pieces of paper are worth less now than in 1970. However, on average wages in 1975, people spent 13.8% of their income on food. Today they only spend 9.6% and they eat out more.<p><a href=""http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/Data/table7.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ers.usda.gov/Briefing/CPIFoodAndExpenditures/Data...</a>",1283962186

1672282,comment,1670228,1671628,0,0,dgallagher,,,"Wow, thanks for all the links! :) I'll put some time aside later this week to watch up on them.<p>--------------------<p>When I lost around 100 pounds years ago, I did it on a mountain dew and rice cake diet (not recommended). That introduced calorie restriction, and it worked. After losing weight, it eventually motivated me to find and eventually adopt a diet that was long-term sustainable.<p>Hopefully the path my father takes is similar. Step #1 isn't always perfect, but it's much easier to take a single step than it is to try and run up a flight of stairs.<p>A former roommate of mine did the same. He went on an all fruit and vegetable diet, going from around 280 pounds down to about 170. That ""beginning"" diet wasn't sustainable, but it helped him lose weight through calorie restriction. Now he's a extremely athletic cyclist, and eats a very healthy well-balanced diet. Step #1 wasn't necessarily perfect, but it eventually got him on the right track.<p>--------------------<p>A lot of the hard research on refined sugar appears to just be coming into light. It'll likely take several more years/decades before its effects are truly understood. Human nutrition in general is AMAZINGLY complex, as there are so many variables interacting with one another.<p>I find it's best to question anything anyone says on the internet regarding nutrition. Ensure they cite sources, state their educational background, etc... Even someone who's a Doctor doesn't always know a lot about nutrition. Typically your best sources are people with PHD's in nutrition, active in the field.<p>Almost everyone on the internet doesn't fall into that category. So when you end up with is a lot of ""snake oil"" advice mixed in with the good. It's a tough problem that needs a solution: ""Verification of the accuracy of online information."" It extends well beyond nutrition and fitness. The solver of that problem has the potential to be larger than even Google. :)",1283961991

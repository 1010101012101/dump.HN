213743,comment,213418,213713,0,0,xirium,,,"It could have been expensive for Microsoft to license single click window closing on a per copy basis and it could have set an expensive precedent. So, they devised numerous methods of closing a window without infringing on the patent. One method was to open a menu on the top left corner of a window, and with or without a second click, selecting the window close item. Another method selects the same menu item by using keyboard sequences. However, no method allowed you to close a window by using a single mouse click.<p>After the patent expired, the keyboard sequences were retained for power users who were already familiar with the sequences. However, the prominance of the menu has declined.<p>> it doesn't work on Firefox<p>I'm not surprised. Firefox on Windows implements its own menu primitives. Many other applications have different versions of the same libraries statically compiled. Obviously, the Firefox implementation doesn't implement a legacy window.",1213095497

Watch them use their chosen text editor as they work through your problem. Have them run their program and watch them iterate through a few code/test/debug cycles. Once it's working, ask them for a minor but logical improvement, and watch their reaction. Dread at having to go back to the code, or gusto in making it better? How fast can they go back and edit their own code?<p>For whatever job you're hiring for, have them <i>do the job</i> as part of the interview process.",1213095156

I actually wrote a new firmware for the Archos multimedia jukebox for that reason - the original software absolutely sucked. Archos then actually threatened to sue me etc etc. Good times, good times...<p>Anyhow. Games consoles are pretty closed, I don't have a problems with the iPhone being closed to be honest. It has a very capabale web browser, which means you can run pretty much anything you like anyway.",1213094938

How is a dollar today worth more than a dollar tommorrow?<p>How is it better to defer payments (add debt) than to pay everything at once?

213727,comment,212838,213033,0,0,olavk,,,"It really depends on what kind of code you are writing. If you are writing a component or framework with a public API to be consumed by others, it is very important to document methods throughly. I agree that the code itself should be as clear and understandable as possible, and a superfluous comment is worse than no comment - DRY.<p>However the more complex and clever the code get, the more you need comments. Note that Knuth, one of the smartest and manliest programmers, invented literate programming.<p>We have no idea whether the woman in question demand stupid superfluous rote comments, or rather want well-documented API's or literate code ala Knuth.<p>BTW. I think the Inquirers slant on the article is clearly sexist, but also that she brought it upon herself by framing the issue in terms of men vs woman.",1213092975

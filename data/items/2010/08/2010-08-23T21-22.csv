Bleach does a quite adequate job of that. However, we care about in vivo efficacy, and that's qualitatively a different problem. For every thousand drugs that seem promising in isolation in a petri dish (e.g. killing cancer cells and not damaging human tissue) perhaps only a handful make it to human trials, and then not all of those prove effective (or completely safe).<p>If every new substance that killed HIV or cancer in the lab made the news then you would not have time to read about anything else, there are more than you could imagine. Substances at the ""kills X in the lab"" stage are generally only of concern to researchers, because the chances that they'll turn into a ""cure"" are extremely low.<p>Buying a lottery ticket isn't news.

It is not hard at all to see vast distribution of such articles on free websites. You only need to buy a subscription to the distributor, and then copy and paste and upload each and everyone of them.

We're not talking anything extravagant here, just 600-900 sq ft.<p>As I said, ""I'm also assuming that the first thing I would do is to pay off my mortgage, so what remains is basically entirely discretionary spending.""  Now, I've chosen not to live in one of those 3 or 4 ridiculously expensive cities.  You might not consider spending $3K for < 1000sqft extravagant, but let me assure you that most people do.

Kids don't actually eat that much, and amuse themselves much more easily than people seem to give them credit for.  Their clothing is fairly cheap, and since they usually grow out of things faster than they wear them out, you can pick up a lot of stuff even cheaper at second-hand shops.<p>I certainly enjoy travel, and it's a non-trivial portion of my discretionary spending.  My point is not that you need to live live a pauper, just that you don't need as much money as you think to have an enjoyable life.  There was a time in my life when I blew through twice what I spend today.  And I use that phrase because I literally couldn't tell you how I did it.  An attitude of ""we've got money; might as well spend it"" caused money to seemingly evaporate with nothing to show for it.  I don't feel any less well off today.

If you compare my mom's childhood with my childhood, she lived in a small apartment almost her whole life, until about 3 years before I was born, while I grew up in a house in the suburbs.<p>I wonder if this is behind a lot of the 20-something angst.

Multi-core processors enjoy significant usage in enterprise desktops and datacenters, and many software developers are only just beginning to realize the full potential of these powerful processors. But developers still find it challenging to build high quality multi-core applications and avoid concurrency bugs. Such bugs are enormously difficult to prevent, and once introduced, even more difficult to find, sometimes taking large development projects weeks and months to discover and resolve. Jinx makes applications “unlucky” by forcing hard-to-find concurrency bugs to occur more frequently and then pointing out the location of the bugs to software developers. With Jinx, organizations can ship software faster and at significantly less cost.<p>Mark Oskin

1628071,comment,1626403,1626403,0,0,drv,,,"Somewhat different from the commuter-oriented topic of the article, I've seen attempts by truckers to enforce a similar pattern in construction zones (traffic reduced by one or more lanes) on long stretches of highway: In a situation where one lane has to merge because it is closed in the distance, the ""nice"" drivers all merge far ahead of time, while the aggressive drivers attempt to go all the way to the end of the lane and then merge ahead of everyone, causing the kind of grinding gears described in the article.  To combat this, a couple of big rigs driven in parallel in the open lane and the lane that is closed ahead block all traffic from passing.  This prevents the aggressive drivers from attempting to merge at the last second, smoothing out the wave.  I've seen this happen several times on cross-country trips; I wonder if the truckers coordinate over radio or just choose to do it independently.<p>On a related note, I wonder if ""lane closed ahead"" signs placed too far ahead actually make this problem worse, since many drivers will immediately merge out of the closing lane far ahead of time, causing a wall of traffic if the front of the line has to slow down for aggressive last-second merges.",1282597856

The appalling figures came popping up into his brain. Last year his income had been $980,000. But he had to pay out $21,000 a month for the $1.8 million loan he had to take out to buy the apartment...
Of the $560,000 remaining of his income last year, $44,400 was required for the apartment’s monthly maintenance fee… $18,000 for heat, utilities, insurance and repairs, $6,000 for lawn and hedge cutting, $8,000 for taxes. Entertaining at home and in restaurants had come to $37,000. This was a modest sum compared to what other people spent.""",1282597504

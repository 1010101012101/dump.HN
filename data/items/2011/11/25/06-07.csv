3276410,comment,3275014,3275014,2,0,lightcatcher,,,"Before reading the content behind this link, I thought for a few minutes about why people procrastinate. I came up with a few reasons:<p>1. Fewer context switches. A true procrastinator only works on the single next thing they have to get done, so they don't have to switch between tasks as often. Imagine the simplicity of popping tasks off of a priority queue compared to some sort of coroutine setup.<p>2. Saves work. Occasionally, the things that people have to do get cancelled. The procrastinator never has to do these things that got cancelled at the last minute, while the person who works ahead does.<p>3. Some kinds of work are easier later. Particularly in collaborative environments, getting things done is much easier when other people have already done some/most of the hard works. Examples of this include my problem sets for school. However, there is less reward for doing things after others. For instance, there is less intrinsic reward for being aided by others than for just doing everything myself on my problem sets, and it is much easier (and much less valuable) to do something like building a light bulb now than it was 100 years ago.",1322202600

Do your research to make sure your expectations aren't completely ridiculous (your school's career office should be helpful here), but negotiate <i>every</i> job offer, fresh out of school or not.<p>In my experience, there's <i>always</i> something more you can get beyond the initial offer (why wouldn't try to get you at a discount if they can?). And as your future compensation packages (both at this employer and at future ones) are influenced by where you start, doing what you can to maximize that will pay off handsomely in the long run. The trick is giving them a reason beyond ""I want more money"" to give you that ""something more"".<p>Sometimes that reason can be credentials / experience / skills they're not taking into account (e.g. when I was graduating, one of my offers didn't take my Masters into account), but the best reason is having one (or more) other offers. Having other offers should also give you the confidence to do a better job negotiating. You've probably heard it is best to look for a job when you already have one. One of the reasons for that is that you have a default ""other offer"". When you don't have that advantage, you have to work harder to create something similar.<p>Good luck.",1322202101

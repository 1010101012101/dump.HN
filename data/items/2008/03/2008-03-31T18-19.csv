151242,comment,151109,151109,0,0,stcredzero,,,">When you break it down, Graham's argument from evolution goes like this: our ancestors worked in groups of eight or so, therefore humans evolved to work in groups of eight or so, therefore contemporary humans will be more alive and fulfilled working in groups of eight or so.<p>>In a general sense, this is the logical fallacy known as the ""appeal to nature"" -- the idea that what's natural is ipso facto good or right. There is no reason to believe this: plenty of natural things are neither good nor right.<p>Paul is not saying that working in groups of about 8 is not ""good or right.""  He's saying that it's satisfying and functional.  It's perfectly reasonable to say that something we were evolved to do is something we do well, and something we were not evolved to do, we have trouble with.",1206987178

While an exaggeration, this example shows(hopefully) that there is an initial resistance when an idea comes from an unlikely source. What method of publication best overcomes this resistance?",1206986644

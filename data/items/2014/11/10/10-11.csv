8582888,comment,8582252,8582252,0,0,sandGorgon,,,"Here&#x27;s a question - has Google made the move to ART for performance reasons or is it because it makes it possible to move to ... say.. Golang for Android ?<p>Let me explain - One of the big reasons that Google cannot switch over to Golang (or Dart, or any other) is that the core of Android SDK is written in Java and therefore every app needs to work with Java to be able to tap into it.<p>However, ART can make it possible for SDK components to compiled down to object code, thus making it possible for Golang/Dart/etc. to link against it, while MAINTAINING backward compatibility with old java apps.<p>Will it allow new apps to be written in pure native code, without relying on the JNI bridge ?",1415616979

8582883,comment,8582175,8582555,0,0,netcan,,,"MasterCard and Visa have the ability to put the full cost of fraud (including a fee for dealing with it) onto merchants in many/most cases. This includes &quot;friendly fraud&quot; of the false chargeback variety (customer falsely claims they did not receive a product) taking advantage of consumer protection guarantees offered by MasterCard and Visa to <i>their</i> customers as a value add.<p>IE, CC companies offer their customers consumer protection to encourage use of their product. They charge <i>merchants</i> when a consumer uses the product. Then, they unload the risks, costs and other burdens inherent in offering this add on service onto merchants as well. This is why they put little effort into investigating claims, making it feasible for merchants to dispute them or otherwise preventing fraudulent claims. It&#x27;s has a distinct odor of oligopoly.<p>Oligopoly also allows for price setting. IE, the forces pushing the cost of a good or service closer to the (marginal) cost of producing it are weak. It could also be that &quot;card present&quot; is cheaper because in-store purchases have to compete with cash purchases. IE, they might be charging the higher fees because they can, not because they have to.",1415616841

What if Google had been bought pre-IPO? Could the World Wide Web have &quot;lost&quot; to some other technology, perhaps centrally controlled? etc.<p>You end up with a lot os scenarios where certain things get set back decades.

The creative zeal of the telecommunications industry is not a force I would like to rely on for progress.<p>Anyway, I think that most &quot;money&quot; industries might be like the web if it hadn&#x27;t hit some lucky breaks. Financial services, ways of moving money from one place to another are incredibly clunky, bureaucratic, expensive, difficult to understand, slow, expensive and expensive. Credit cards are expensive, complicated, & oligopolistic. Bank transfers are slow and bureaucratic. It&#x27;s ridiculous that heavy, stealable, physical money is cheaper to handle than electronic variants.<p>This is all a very straightforward example of &quot;transaction costs,&quot; a concept at the centre of many basic and fundamental economics theories. Basically, transaction costs permeate everything in economics by reducing efficiency and limiting the velocity and cumulative volume of transactions, which are one of the few very basic elements in the economics&#x27; periodic table (say, resources, labour, technology, consumption & transactions… or something).<p>Many massive efforts have been made to reduce transactions costs in the form of barriers to entry or international trade. Transaction costs inherent in our financial services industry are the same sort of problem, probably even more important.<p>A 10, 100 or 1000X reduction in transaction costs could have a lever effect on the economy similar to the discovery of a new energy source, continent, new method of communication, better legal paradigm or some other fundamental column in an economy.<p>This is why I was (and still am) hoping for cryptocurrencies to succeed. Who knows where it could go.<p>Whatever you think of Walmart, they are obsessed with costs and efficiency. I&#x27;m not surprised this pushes their buttons.

I run into the same &quot;once off&quot; problems more frequently, and getting more value out of debugging them.  I&#x27;m getting better at using my tools, better at tying symptoms to causes, better at coming up with appropriate defensive coding techniques, and writing more (reusable) code that makes them easier to debug when they (and entire categories of similar bugs) reoccur.<p>> Part of this skill is also being able to recognize when a bug you thought had been routed around was simply swept under the rug, and changing course to understand it properly instead of sweeping it under the rug again.<p>Frequently not possible on two fronts:<p>On recognizing it:  I&#x27;ve seen a distressing number of bugs which are hideously context sensitive (meaning &quot;works fine on my machine&quot; is the punchline because it&#x27;s 100% broken on another, only now you&#x27;ve got a terrible bug report and no good repro case)<p>On changing course:  Any offline distribution channel.

8582836,comment,8582132,8582231,0,0,higherpurpose,,,"Well yes, the whole voting system in US needs to be overhauled. US may have one of the most human-rights-friendly Constitution in the world, but out of all the &quot;democratic&quot; countries it has one of the <i>least</i> democratic voting systems. Heck, people don&#x27;t even vote their candidates directly in US. You can hardly get any less democratic than that, in any other democratic country.<p>But my point was the US needs a proportional party system, which better represents (in aggregate) the wishes of the people. The two current parties don&#x27;t represent the wishes of a lot of people right now, especially when it comes to issues like foreign policy and surveillance.<p>A proportional party system would also make it easier for <i>new</i> parties to rise up and become the &quot;major&quot; parties, while the current &quot;major&quot; parties like the Republican and Democratic Party to die off.<p>For example, a more <i>libertarian</i> party could kill the current Republican Party, which is <i>very little</i> libertarian, especially when you consider the conservative Republicans pretending to be libertarians, but still are pro-surveillance, pro-police state, pro-&quot;tough on crime&quot;, pro-wars, pro-christianity, pro-coal - which have nothing to do with libertarian-ism.<p>Also a more progressive party could kill the Democratic party, with a much bigger push for renewable energy, civil liberties, gun control, campaign finance reform, stronger bank regulations and prosecutions, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s all about competition, even in elections. Right now there&#x27;s no competition to Republicans on the right side, which is why they can afford to vote for <i>bigger</i> budgets for the military and pro-surveillance, despite pretending to be a party of &quot;small government&quot;, while on the left side, the Democrats also have no competition when it comes to ensuring banks get punished and are well regulated, and so on.<p>A proportional party system together with a really good voting system (perhaps approval voting or range voting) could fix <i>most</i> of those problems.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s all going to be perfect, but for example, if the Republican party wins with a 40 percent share, and the Libertarian Party takes 12 percent, the Republicans will most likely have to ally with the Libertarians to control Congress, otherwise Democrats and Progressives will have a bigger majority than them.

It is partly a result of colonialism, partly of nationalism, partly of globalization and partly of the way world unfolded after WW2.<p>Basically, beginning of the century, when Asian countries got &#x27;freedom&#x27;, all the political leaders who got power were educated in western philosophy. They read western books, spoke western languages as a sign of education and adopted competing western ideologies as the model of society. The old, native one was discarded because it was a memorial of defeat. And people accepted it. You can see that everywhere - Gandhi was a barrister who wore coat before he become a monk (and all his lieutenants, from Nehru to Ambedkar, wore suits), Mao wore western clothes. Korean, Japan - they are the best examples of it. Rich people had become rich by following foreigners, and when foreigners left them alone, these same rich westernized people became rulers. Since then there is a fascination with everything west. There are some poor people who are still clinging to the old system, if they can. But the middle class has almost no option if they want to get rich.<p>As I said, it is a very complicated topic in sociology and there is no way I can explain it, as much as I understood it, here.

How much additional ART development effort is required for correct execution of non-AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) Java applications (essentially, headless server processes)?  I know the Java/JVM ecosystem well, but I have not done any Android development.

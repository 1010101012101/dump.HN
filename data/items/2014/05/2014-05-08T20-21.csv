Which is why I believe that if you really want to teach someone software design principles, you have to be prepared show them an actual, real software system; the real problem you encountered; the reason why you picked a particular solution; and the results of that choice (both pros and cons). All the details.<p>Given that data, its easy for a developer to extrapolate (more general) principles that may apply for their own concrete situations and problems, if any.<p>If you do the extrapolation of the principle yourself but hide the data that caused you to arrive to that principle, nobody will learn anything.<p>I have no idea why software architects do this.

Apple products are a specific niche, and you can&#x27;t take your Apple dealer and turn it into something else with much hope of success. Selling PCs is a pretty different business.<p>But when it comes to car, surely selling Fords is much the same as selling Toyotas? If Toyota treated a dealership badly, why wouldn&#x27;t they shop around for a brand that would treat them better?

7717644,comment,7716587,7717223,4,0,tomkinstinch,,,"The major accomplishment of the paper referenced in the original article is that they demonstrated the feasibility of unnatural bases in vivo. The work in the Yang, et. al. paper occurred in vitro, whereas the Malyshev paper was in an E. coli system. Malyshev, et al. noticed that the unnatural bases were being degraded in the space between inner and outer cell membranes (periplasm), so they added a membrane transport protein to import the unnatural bases into the cell. From there, the E. coli was able to incorporate the unnatural bases into replicates of an introduced DNA segment (plasmid) using its endogenous replication machinery. They also demonstrated that the unnatural bases were not a hinderance to growth, and they they were not excised by the DNA repair enzymes.<p>There have been other papers demonstrating the use of unnatural bases in various cases in vitro (some cited in the paper), but this is notable because it is a thorough example of use in vivo. Peter Schultz has done similar work, as well as exciting work on unnatural bases in tRNA.<p>The bases in the Yang paper and those in the Malyshev paper both exhibit Watson-Crick bonding geometry, and pair by hydrogen bonding. One distinction of those mentioned in the Malyshev paper is the presence of a sulfur substituent, though there is no mention of its participation in the bond.",1399582580

If it is a consumer product where viral adoption can happen you might get a big enough start just by being first to market. It can be intimidating to face a team - but recall that teams have communication overhead, often multiple competing visions for the product that need to be resolved and time sucked up into numerous activities that don&#x27;t directly speed product development.<p>If this is a product for enterprises then you are at a greater disadvantage.

Priuses tend to cost about $30,000 all in.  Ford Explorers start at $30,000.  Assume $10,000 in after-market add-ons, but then assume that Lyft negotiates your base price down to $25,000 because they&#x27;re buying a bunch of them, you&#x27;re only an additional $5,000 in the hole compared to a Prius.  Gas is twice what a Prius owner pays.<p>And they&#x27;re charging twice what Lyft ordinarily costs.<p>So, basically, if they can deliver the same number of rides, your gross is twice as high, your costs are something on the order of twice as high or actually a bit less than that, means that your take-home pay is probably about 150% what a normal Lyft driver makes.<p>Again, the big if here is whether you are in fact getting the same volume of rides that the downmarket offering is.  And the question there is how much supply Lyft wants to put on the road.  Are they willing to have more failed rides in order to support their drivers&#x27; incomes?  Is the demand for a Lyft premium option there at all?  Alternately, is the demand really high and you&#x27;re going to be surging (yeah, yeah: &quot;prime time tipping&quot;) more often and making a higher gross?

7717383,comment,7717380,7717380,1,0,jimrandomh,,,"Text for those who can&#x27;t get through the paywall:<p>I realize that the Glass software development team has their hands full with kernel-panic/boot-loop issues and with getting video calls working again, but as a developer and power user I&#x27;m feeling really neglected and abused. The ability to pair with a Bluetooth keyboard and run regular Android apps is important to me. It hasn&#x27;t worked since November (XE11). The auto-updater is extremely aggressive and can&#x27;t be disabled (once you&#x27;re in the gradual-rollout set), and every update breaks API compatibility, without warning, even where warning would be easy to give; so you can&#x27;t trust that Glass will work for a demo. There are no Google developers participating in the Glassware Developers forum. The GDK still doesn&#x27;t support voice menus on cards.<p>I waited past the end of my Glass 30-day return window and 120-day CC chargeback window because I thought things were going to get better. Instead, they got worse. I have yet to see a version that works as well as XE11 did. (Except that once a device has had XE16 installed on it, XE11 won&#x27;t boot anymore.)<p>So, there are a few options for Google at this point. Option one, the default option, is to just plow forward with the current developers and the current strategy. Frankly, I don&#x27;t see this plan working out. There are clearly process problems, the pace of development has been glacial, and competition is coming.<p>Option two is to continue with a different development team, or with a lot more manpower added to the current development team. I get the impression that either the software development team is less than half the size it needs to be, or half the development team is working on secret projects that we&#x27;re not seeing and not addressing current pain points.<p>Option three is to make Glass open source. Right now it&#x27;s exactly as closed as it legally can be, and this is causing a ton of pain; there are many issues affecting us developers that we&#x27;d be happy to go ahead and fix, but can&#x27;t. Google having started from Android, which is open source, and closed it, really feels like a betrayal of principles. If there are plans to eventually open it up, then accelerating those plans would make a lot of problems go away. I&#x27;ve burned a lot of hours trying to get Google to pay attention to bugs which I probably could&#x27;ve fixed in just a few hours myself. (A leak would also work.)<p>When I first heard about and when I first got Glass, I was unreservedly enthusiastic. Little by little, that turned to anger, as updates broke it in uses where I had put a lot of effort into getting it working, and Google was completely unresponsive to my complaints. Now I&#x27;m just resigned. I&#x27;d like to see Glass get back on track, but the lack of progress or communication is just unimaginably frustrating.<p>This has been a problem for the entire six months I&#x27;ve had Glass. It came, it worked just long enough for me to set up some really neat things and get emotionally invested, then Bam! XE12 comes along and breaks it. Start looking into workarounds, battle the auto-updater which won&#x27;t let me stay at XE11, then Bam! Screen dead. Warranty replacement turnaround takes 23 days. Figure I can wait for XE14, two months drag into three months drag into four months, XE16 comes out. Instead of a fix for XE12&#x27;s issues, it renders XE11 unbootable, won&#x27;t pair with a bluetooth keyboard, removes support for gestures in regular Android apps, and crashes all the time. But before getting to the point of finding out it&#x27;s unusable, it takes some work: got to hunt down new versions of all the relevant software, because 0% of third-party software is compatible. So after I&#x27;ve gotten set back up with an only-half-working launcher and see how broken things are, I start making some noise, and Bam! Closed: WontFix. So I start making some more noise. Crickets. Oh, here comes XE17! But not for you, it&#x27;s missing from the downloads page. Two days later it auto-updates, and nothing&#x27;s changed - still crashy, still can&#x27;t pair with either of my keyboards, still can&#x27;t navigate Android apps with gestures.<p>At this rate, I half-expect Google I/O to find some way to brick my phone.",1399579847

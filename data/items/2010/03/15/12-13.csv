(1) He was implementing a computer system designed to run a centrally planned state and used it in anger; (2) he had a stated aim to seize and redistribute property based on priorities to be determined by a central authority; (3) he was forming strategic relations with the soviet union; (4) he was undermining the separation of powers in the standing constitution; (5) close working relationship with the communist party, sometimes against the perspective of his own party and supporters.<p><pre><code>    In places where a tiny minority have a chokehold\n    on a country's economy land reform is a pretty\n    essential prerequisite to general political and\n    social equality\n</code></pre>\nSocial equality is an unachievable ideal though.<p>Chile never underwent that reform, and has for the last twenty years been the most stable elected parliament in the region, with economic growth at all levels of society.

He was supported by his local communist party and was setting up an intelligence relationship with the Soviet Union, and the cold war was on.<p>But I agree with you that the US would do better by leading by example rather than meddling in the affairs of other states, and that that sort of conduct is the 'right' thing to do.",1268657881

With that being said, I still love YC and it makes sense for a lot of companies and I agree with pg that it just wasn't right for mine.<p>Here are a couple things I have learned about funding in my last 2 years building my startup:<p>1. Funding is mostly a security blanket. An expensive and usually unnecessary one. I think most startups do worse with funding because they lose that fight or flight mechanism that drives entrepreneurs to do mind-blowing things. I don't think most ideas require funding exceeding the seed stage, which is usually a lot cheaper if you can find it elsewhere. For example, I launched my company to profitability with just 3 laptops + servers, which you can usually dump onto credit cards if you're growing way faster than your cash-flow (which makes your startup cost almost $0 to start).<p>2. You cannot base your startup's success on whether or not one person (pg) believes you can make it. If nothing else, pg cannot possibly be an expert in every field.<p>3. Money is EVERYWHERE in the valley. It is absurd how many different VCs there are, and how much money they're obligated to deploy in behalf of their LPs. There are definitely less opportunities than the money out there to fund them. Getting funding is pretty easy. It's all about building models that you can plug a # into and get a bigger # out, which if anyone needs help with please feel free to email me.<p>4. Lastly, if you believe you can make it, no one can stop you. Go be a tiger.",1268654732

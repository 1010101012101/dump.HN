Those activities, in particular, are considerably heavier on the network than, say, downloading a single, or even a series of webpages.<p>One way the major carriers can do this is by disallowing certain kinds of activities. For example, as seen on the iPhone, users are not allowed to download files more than 10MB in size. That isn't a case of ""what"" a person can download, but instead an issue of ""how much"" a person can download in a small period of time. Is that still 'net neutrality'? And, if not, then how is VOIP any different?<p>(This is under the presupposition that the price increase was ATT's doing, and they're not doing it because it's taking away from their profits; but instead they're fearing that VOIP will cause an even greater tax on their already strained network.)",1275260375

In the case of iced espresso beverages, most coffee shops around here (megachain or otherwise) typically add an extra shot of espresso to the iced drinks, presumably to compensate for the melting ice.  This adds to the cost, as more coffee is going into the drink.<p>Now, whether or not a shot of espresso costs a dollar is a whole other issue, but it does make sense.  You aren't paying for coldness or the different cup or ""seasonal rarity"", you're paying for that extra shot at the usual extra shot price.",1275260261

1391264,comment,1389001,1390331,0,0,jrockway,,,"The reality is that JFK-LHR and JFK-CDG were not really very long flights to begin with.  I'm not sure why the Concorde was used for those routings.<p>But for routings like ORD-HKG or JFK-NRT, I think a faster airplane would be a good solution.  These flights, when I've flown them (actually PVG-ORD and ORD-NRT), have been completely full in first and business class -- and first class is over $10,000 one way.  I think people would be OK with a smaller seat if it meant they were in the air for 6 hours instead of 13.  13 hours is a lot of time to kill, even if you have a fully-flat bed and laptop power.  (For me, anyway.  I can't sleep on planes at all, even in the good seats.)<p>I don't completely agree with your numbers about travel time to and from the airport though.  It takes me 45 minutes to take the subway from my house to ORD, and then 30 minutes to get from check-in to the gate (10 minutes before departure, of course).  So that's 2 hours on one end.  On the other end, it's never taken me more than 2 hours to get from an airport to city center... even in Tokyo (where the airport isn't even in the same prefecture as Tokyo).  London is particularly easy; immigration is pretty efficient, and the express trains to Paddington are very fast.<p>Anyway, I think the Concorde discontinuation was due to ""maximizing shareholder value"" rather than revenue issues.  Concorde was considered the ""best"" option between two cities that had Concorde service, but it was usually less expensive than ""real"" first class.  That is a lost revenue opportunity, Concorde resulted in less profit per passenger-mile, and it cannibalized the super-profitable high-end business.<p>(That's what's really holding society back -- shareholders.)",1275260051

1391224,comment,1390440,1390440,0,0,strlen,,,"I highly suggest going the technical route. Ask yourself this: would you prefer to be a software developer in a start-up (including your own), or a manager in a more established firm? If the only sort of management you see yourself doing is in <i>your own company</i>, I don't see an MBA as being very useful to you. You need to be some self-sufficient, meaning you should know how to code and not <i>just</i> how to manage. It's easier to bring in outside managerial talent to a purely technical firm rather than vice versa (I personally would <i>never</i> be the first programmer in someone else's company, many other hackers are similar).<p>You already have a strong background in a quantitative discipline (CEng). It means you'll have an easy time picking up either. Don't forget the advantage that this gives you. That means you'll have an easier time with statistics, mathematics and numerical analysis: this opens up a whole new world for you that's closed to many programmers who are only good at programming.<p>That being said, there's a lot you still have to learn. Start with learning C (you might not develop your application it, but a) you need to understand how physical memory works in order to be a programmer b) C is the lingua franca of programming languages which means you'll have no problems learning whatever <i>other</i> language is better for the task at hand), then learn algorithms and data structures and at least three of (compilers, operating systems, databases, computer networking).  Then specialize: machine learning/NLP/IR (given your ""real engineering"" background, you might have an easier time here than most programmers), further into systems, further into databases, etc...<p>That's a multi-year project and you have to be ready for it.\nDon't under-estimate the value of experience (by experience I mean working in firms whose product is software i.e., <i>not</i> consulting or internal IT development) in doing a start-up: it's possible to start without ""having done it before"", but several years of work experience (alongside people much smarter and more experienced than you) is extremely useful. Experienced developers have a huge role to play in a start-up: partly by making it possible for apt junior developers to be recruited (they want to work alongside ""hard core"" hackers) and mentored.<p>If you join a start-up, it's also a chance to be exposed to the ""business side"" as well -- although certain types of established firms (in my experience, those who build software for other developers) will give you exposure to customers and sales/support cycle as a developer too.<p>If you prefer a more structured environment in which to learn (as do I -- there is absolutely nothing wrong with that), an MSCS will serve you well. It's also a chance to meet hackers, show your ""worth"" to them (they'll have collaborated on lab projects with you) and make connections without looking like a ""shmoozer"". It will also give you credentials for employment (getting initial experience), although I'd have zero hesitation in hiring a self-taught hacker with a degree in Civil Eng (software development is really an engineering discipline rather than a science).",1275258388

The elites permit democracy, but they reserve the right to decide what the standards for participation should be. Who decides what ""good-faith"" means? This isn't conspiracy, it is ideological delusion: elites become corrupt because they're convinced of their own benevolence, that because they stand for Democracy and Decentralization (today's empty signifiers, replacing God, Nation), preserving their elite position is justified. It is definitely not because they cynically manipulate, pulling the strings behind the scenes while laughing at the deluded masses. It's a natural human tendency to see yourself as acting only for the greater good, and to adopt an ideology that explains why what's good for you is good for all.<p>As I mentioned before, my preferred solution to elite power is not some fantasy of ""true democracy"", which only ends up concealing real power. Nor do I think that elite control is necessarily a bad thing, only concealing elite power behind mask of democracy. Scientific knowledge is an obvious arena where we are best served by having an elite. But if they abuse their power, we should be ready with the (metaphorical) guillotine. In the case of Facebook, the real response is not a different, more decentralized system, but the guillotine of strong privacy regulations. Or government enforcement of net neutrality, and so on. The libertarian & anti-government leanings of the tech community is more evidence in favor of my argument. Is this not just another way to defend an oligarchy? I think many sincerely believe that this is the best arrangement, but avoiding the facts might cast some doubt on this.",1275258097

Many of the projects that didn't originate at Google wouldn't have seen the light of day if Google or someone with comparative capital hadn't acquired them. And actually, it's a bit ironic that you make this complaint here given the subject of the article, since acquiring startups is a way to hire people who are both smart and get things done.<p>""Originated"" is also somewhat ambiguous. There are at least a couple of examples where Google was working on a project internally and saw a similar external project that they decided to acquire and merge with the internal project. Did the resulting project ""originate"" at Google? Even if you answer no, I think at least half of the items at that list still ""originated"" at Google.",1275257989

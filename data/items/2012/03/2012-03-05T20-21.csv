I think its good you realized its something we all do in different forms like as in understanding Trigonometry or Logarithms. 
I would suggest you to take some basic algorithms and spend a week devouring and playing with them sooner or later everything will start sinking in, Hope this helps.",1330981189

I also wrote a pastebin in Clojure: <a href=""https://refheap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://refheap.com</a><p>It has an emphasis on being excellent for Clojure but supports a lot of languages via pygments. It seems that it is becoming the defacto #clojure pastebin.<p>My plans for RefHeap in the future include supporting basically everything gist supports (without using git for anything other than versioning the project itself ;)) and code evaluation. A friend of mine is working on an API-based code eval service that will support tons of languages. We plan to tie that into RefHeap when it is ready.<p>Anyways, good work.

3668306,comment,3667716,3667952,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think polemic brings a valid point of view here. The phone maker has huge costs that they are recovering, the network has lots of costs, both on-going and sunk, that it is covering. The developer, well he's got his time and if you want to include his depreciation of his development setup.<p>Lets say the developer spends $10K on equipment to do development, and maybe $2,400/yr on net access and developer subscriptions, etc. So with a 3 year straight line depreciation they have maybe $5.7K in costs for the year. And in that year they make an application which sells for $1. At a 60/40 rev share that is 5700/.66 or 8636 sales to cover their annual cost and 20K sales if they want to have a 55% gross margin on their software business.<p>Of course $13K/yr for an app isn't a living wage. But then again if you only make 1 app a year and sell it for 0.99 you're not exactly as productive as say someone who makes 4 apps in the same time frame.<p>Business analysis aside however, the App market does seem a bit like it shot itself in the foot. I mean the typical ASP per game on a game console is north of $35. Why are iPhone Apps $0.99?",1330981088

We are doing AJAX and the amount of data we are sending back causes 2-3 second delays. Similar sites have accomplished it almost instantaneously.<p>What I found was that the sites I checked used localStorage, or at least from what I could tell from the minimized javascript. It seems like most of the established players have concluded that there is no better alternative and that they will just need to hack together something with localStorage: which brings me to my request:<p>Perhaps someone can elaborate not only on the pitfalls of localStorage/sessionStorage, but the best ways of working around them?",1330981077

How much was new, and how well did the signal hold up to the noise?  We went from pure text, which was mostly well-written, to a heavily graphical environment.  Pages didn't render so hot but some of the crazier websites were just about to do some really impressive things.  Webmail was becoming a cute way to check your mail real quick when you weren't at your regular computer.<p>Now you're in 2002 and are warping to the present day.  Now how much was new?  Somewhere in between it got fast and diverse enough to replace television.  Browsers got real good at all rendering the same thing.  The client side code started getting robust.  The noise level is at an all time high.  Advertising runs rampant.  Fraud is prolific and all sorts of infrastructure is integrated and allows all sorts of use and misuse.  Add to this the upcoming significance of mobile computing.<p>Now with this cadence of the imagination, pole-vault yourself into 2022.  It's ten years from now.  How is the signal compared to the noise?  How is the 'web' doing?  How are the programmers that created it?  Their upcoming replacements have never known a webless world.  Few were trained in college, nor vocational centers, but simply picked the skills up as part of the natural landscape of growing up.  Programming has had another 10 years of abstraction.  Graphical environments allow programmers to metaphorically build entire program flows the same way a call center employee reads a script.  Creativity within these environments is stifled, undesired, expensive.  But it pays the bills and keeps the net flowing back at home.<p>The blue collar programmer of 2022 goes home from their job, fatigued from a day of pointing their fingers at 4 foot glass displays.  They feel a relief when they get home to an 8 foot display, where they can run some white collar's program for the remainder of the night.  The program is a mix of video games and social networking.

When I was a Windows user, I rarely used the Start Menu. It was, in my view, the worst part of Windows. Vista improved things -- please, hold your jeering until the end of the speech -- with the type-to-search feature; conveniently available at the press of the Windows key. In WinXP, I memorized many application executable names so I could press winkey+R to invoke the run dialog, then launch the app from there. Vista meant I no longer had to memorize! Yay!<p>On OS X, I'm intensely addicted to Quicksilver. I know many others who use Alfred, or even the built-in Spotlight search feature, all of which are invoked from a readily accessible keyboard shortcut.<p>There must be a Windows equivalent? If not, here's a pro-tip for Microsoft: build a smart launcher in to the OS, and make the back-end pluggable so others can write their own alternatives and market them. Power users will shut up about the new Start screen, because they'll never bother with it. The rest of us will enjoy our shiny new dynamic tiles and can get on with our lives.",1330979702

You want your product to create value for the user, but you also want to be the one that captures that value (in the form of $$).<p>IBM in the 80s/90s created a massive amount of value with the PC, but let Microsoft and Intel capture just about all of that value.  Bad move on their part.<p>Apple, on the other hand, has positioned itself in such a way that it captures a huge percentage of the value that its mobile products create.  Its pretty amazing what they did, particularly in the US where historically the power in the mobile industry was in the network providers, not the device companies.  And as you've pointed out, they've somehow convinced app developers to work for almost nothing to add lots of functionality to their products (which helps sell more products).<p>Obviously not a groundbreaking recommendation here: pay attention to what Apple did.

I got into the habit of doing this since it's immediately obvious that the value you're comparing is expected to be a boolean and not something like an integer, which could cause subtle bugs later on if what you thought was a boolean gets negated. More commonly, it's of the form:<p><pre><code>  if (someValue == false) ...
</code></pre>
rather than:<p><pre><code>  if (!someValue) ...
</code></pre>
to distinguish this from:<p><pre><code>  if (someValue == 0) ...

Unbounce free gives you only a 200 unique visitor limit, so the minute you might want to start using the A/B testing and other data (when you have a lot of traffic), you get kicked off.<p>3) You need a video to show this off -- before I download an app I want to know what it looks like, how it works, things like that. I know the android market link shows off a few pictures, but I think you should also have them on your website as well.",1330977671

I don't see why the desktop environment would matter--the program doesn't have to (and probably shouldn't) care whether I'm on Gnome or KDE or Unity.<p>Moreover, all the popular environments support both GTk and Qt fairly well, and both are cross-platform, so you would actually be supporting <i>more</i> users than with a Mac OS-only program.<p>Really, fragmentation like this is not nearly the issue people make it out to be. Basically, everybody can use everybody else's programs on Linux, with the exception of very odd or customized systems. And the sort of people who have very odd and customized systems can fix problems themselves.<p>EDIT: Also, you could use wxWidgets. That would give you a native look on all the platforms you support.<p>I would also like to clarify that I understand an OS X user wanting to write an OS X-only program. The real issue is dissuading others from supporting Linux because of non-existent fragmentation issues. They simply do not affect people using GTk or Qt, in practice.",1330977633

It should poll for updates every 30 minutes until it gets closer to when you need to leave, then we ask for updates the closer we get to your ""Bounce time.""<p>2. Yeah, we'll make it smarter so you can customize which events it notifies you for and which it doesn't.<p>Thanks again.",1330977630

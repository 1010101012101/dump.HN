There's a good chance they won't even make it out of the house, but many people smoke daily and go about their business no matter where you live. No one notices or cares. And if there are people stoned every day then there are people people driving around you are stoned every day. These people are a threat to no one because they are practically unimpaired. It's not even  comparable to driving drunk unless you're on edibles or are very unexperienced, so they go unnoticed as well. It's just not a big deal anymore.",1324929525

And I'm making the assumption that we're comparing drugs of high quality in either category (because obviously drugs that are mixed with adulterants are going to have other problems). You seem to understand what's going on, but for anybody else who's curious:<p>Adderall isn't methamphetamine. However, the methyl group doesn't change the way that the drug affects the brain; it just makes the drug cross the blood-brain barrier more easily. The increased bioavailability means that less of the drug (by weight) is needed to achieve the same result, but the drug isn't activating any different receptors or having a substantially different neurological effect in any other way or for any other reason. Subjectively, there may appear to be a difference for that reason (more efficient access to the brain), but the same pathways are being accessed - just to a greater degree.<p>An analogous and more familiar (but not identical) example would be Vyvanse and Adderall. The actual metabolic process is different from the example above, but in essence, about 50% of Vyvanse is lost when converting from a form which has no effect on the brain to a form which does. Once it's converted, it's chemically equivalent to Adderall. That's part of why Adderall XR is prescribed in doses about half the weight of Vyvanse.<p>[Nitpick: Yes, this isn't a perfect analogy; pharmacology is complicated! Vyvanse contains a single enantiomer of a single amphetamine; Adderall contains two enantiomers each of two amphetamines, but if you know that, you probably already know everything else I'm clarifying here anyway. The reason Vyvanse has reportedly lower side-effects is because it lacks the less effective l-enantiomer, not because the amphetamine is otherwise radically different.]<p>Maybe I should have been a bit clearer, but my point was that Adderall (legally prescribed amphetamine), Desoxyn (legally prescribed methamphetamine), [street] methamphetamine, and [street] amphetamines ('speed') are pharmacokinetically different because of the way that they are taken, the mode of ingestion, and the set & setting, not because of the active ingredient itself. In general, people don't seem to understand that difference, and for that matter, neither do our laws.<p>[Disclaimer: Everything I've said above is 'false' in the sense that it is an oversimplification, but this is HN, not a discussion board on pharmacology, so I'm sacrificing some precision in favor of accessibility/simplicity and (attempted) conciseness.]",1324927163

Apple maybe has it the easiest with their limited selection of devices, but even they can't support old hardware indefinitely.<p>No-one expects indefinite support. The problem is that the Galaxy S was released <i>only 16 months ago</i>, and is still available in some countries. And the Galaxy Tab is only 13 months old, and is also still being sold.<p>The comparable situation from the competitors would be if the iPhone 4 couldn't be upgraded to iOS 5.0.<p>In reality, Apple is still supporting the iPhone 3GS (released a whopping 30 months ago) and the third-gen iPod Touch (released 27 months ago, discontinued 15 months ago).

If we all returned tires to Nordstrom they'd very quickly shutdown the practice, if they actually even do it now.  Upgrades to Android phones would have to be practiced -- Samsung just can't create an urban legend that some phone in the midwest of the US was updated before.<p>2) Most people prefer cheaper prices rather than more expensive prices w/ better support.  I don't have data, but I suspect that Walmart consistently does better than Nordstrom.<p>And if Samsung effectively doubles the lifetime of each Android device and it's successful then other Android manufacturers will do the same.  The net effect?  Half total revenue in the Android marketspace -- unless this practice is able to eat away at iPhone -- which I doubt since Apple already does a pretty solid job of updates.<p>It's one of those things that would be better for the customer.  But due to the way the market is segmented it likely hurt the bottom line.<p>The only company that could pull this is off is Motorola.  Google doesn't care about the total revenue in the HW market.  What's Samsung and HTC going to do?  Focus on Windows Phone?  Not likely.  Google could squeeze almost all of the profits out of the HW manufacturers knowing they have very little alternative.

3393654,comment,3393284,3393555,11,0,cek,,,"People ask me all the time why, if I think Windows Phone is such an excellent product, sales appear so lackluster.<p>(This post got long. tl;dr: Microsoft's approach with WP7 has a significant impedance mismatch with the carriers & device manufacturers. Will end-user dissat with Android be strong enough to overcome this impedance mismatch...that is the question.)<p>The fact that Windows Phone has, thus far, avoided fragmentation (almost every WP7 device from every manufacture r & carrier automatically got updated to WP7.5 ""Mango"" this fall) actually points to one of the core reasons:<p>_The device manufacturers, mobile operators, OS providers, and end users operate in an overly complex virtuous cycle_<p>A virtuous cycle is one where each side of the market both gives and receives positive value from the other sides. So much positive value is exchanged, with low friction, that the cycle grows and grows, like a snowball rolling down hill.  The more sides to the market that exist, the more complex the system.<p>In the mobile device space the four primary sides of the market are not actually aligned very well. In fact, there is such deep <i>misalignment</i> that there is great instability.  Android has succeeded by capitalizing on that misalignment. Windows Phone is attempting a different strategy...<p>Carriers: Own the customer.  Own billing. Own Sales. Own the physical pipe. They hate being just a fat dumb pipe, but their capex structure means they will never be anything but a fat dumb pipe.<p>Device Mfgs:  Own the hardware. Own the industrial design. They hate not owning the customer.  But their HW bias (and manufacturing capex structure) prevent them from breaking out of this.<p>OS providers: Own the core of the customer experience. Own most real innovation. They hate not owning the customer. Their core business models (search, desktop/server OS, office, ...), as well as the fact they can't build HW, means they are always at the mercy of some middleman between them and the customer.<p>Users: Own the disposable income. They don't know what they hate. All they know is they buy phone service from mobile carriers and/or buy a phone from a carrier.  They love speeds & feeds and will generally buy anything they are told to by television ads and RSPs (Retail Sales Professionals).<p>Note that Apple circumvented this by cutting the device manufacturer out and used that fact to force the carriers into being even more of a fat dumb pipe. Topic for another day, but my belief is over time this strategy will start to deteriorate for Apple.<p>Android has been wildly successful because it was built to reduce friction between all sides of the market. It 'bows down' to the device manufactures AND the carriers. It enabled device manufactures to do what they do best (build lots of devices).  It enabled carriers to do what they do best (market lots of devices).  It enabled users tons of choice. My hypothesis is that it also enables too much fragmentation that will eventually drive end users nuts.<p>Windows Phone has taken a different approach. It raises it's middle finger at both the device manufactures and carriers. It says ""here's they hardware spec you shalt use"".  And it says ""Here's how it will be updated"" (to the carriers).<p>Thus both of those sides of the market are _reluctant_.  Especially the carriers.<p>This is why, despite being a superior PRODUCT to Android, Windows Phone has not sold as well.<p>The question in my mind is whether Microsoft's continued investment in WP and close partnership with device manufactures such as Nokia will eventually enable a breakthrough here. I know that MS can be very persistent & patient; it's been so in the past. We will see.",1324926802

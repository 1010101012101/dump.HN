8838509,comment,8838253,8838253,0,0,alkonaut,,,"A sports analogy appeared in yesterday&#x27;s HN thread on this topic: the difference between an average runner and the fastest man alive is less than 50%. The counter argument here is that the measurable variable here isn&#x27;t really the skill of the programmer but the success of the company (or equivalent). You only have to be best by a small margin to win. If you count wins between me and Usain Bolt he would be more than 10x as successful. Now you could argue that a lot of programming is just factory work; you can complete it in 20% longer time and your salary is lower by some factor. The truth is somewhere in between: a company with developers and other staff that are better than their competition by some factor, will go on to be a successful company a lot more often than others. The measurable business result could be thousands of times better.
So what is being measured? We can&#x27;t measure &quot;skill&quot; separate from experience, but even as a compound the interesting measure is the success of what you produce. If your product or service is earlier on the market or slightly better, you might have 10x the return of the &quot;average&quot;.",1420462699

8838471,comment,8837508,8837508,0,0,gitaarik,,,"I like to advocate against using placeholder texts most of the time. The problem is often that designers/developers have to create a page with some content on it, but they don&#x27;t know the content yet. They know a bit what it&#x27;s about but the real texts on the page are not ready yet. Then they use Lorem Ipsum or something else.<p>This is wrong from the start. Before designing a page, you should know what the content is gonna be. The content should then decide what the design is gonna look like. Essentially, content is part of the design.<p>Designs that used placeholder texts like Lorum Ipsum can also fail, because the real texts turn out to be much shorter/longer than the placeholder text. Or the text is really something else than the designer/developer expected. Or the designer placed some cool text box somewhere but nobody has an idea what kind of content they should put there. This often results in useless texts appearing on the page because the design demands it. Or the other way around, the product owner wants to add a certain text somewhere, but there&#x27;s not really a place for that in the design, often resulting in an ugly/quick fix.<p>In the end it is all about the content. The design is to complement the content. So I think generally the best approach is to start with the content, then create a design to complement the content.<p>Of course, in some situations it&#x27;s not possible, but if you can, start with the content!",1420461972

&quot;The transactions on the blockchain are not reversable&quot;.  However, on other occassions they were reversed.  And, coinbase collects a fee each and every transaction and assumes a fiduciary responsibility for facilitating bitcoin transfters between buyer/seller.  Thus, when you send bitcoins through coinbase, you can never know if the transactions are fraud or not.  You could be getting ripped off, just like I was.  
 While  coinbase made me verify my accounts, including a credit card and bank account to &quot;prevent fraud&quot; coinbase claims to &quot;not know&quot; who was on the other side of the transaction, that is, who is receiving the bitcoin. I     I lost about 41 bitcoins or $16,000 in this transaction which Coinbase refuses to fix.

I was purely taught Java at university, but was keen to learn other languages as I wanted to expand my knowledge past what Java would offer me. Sure, Java to C# isn&#x27;t a huge paradigm shift, but after playing with LINQ I was sold on .NET.<p>For my final-year project, I built a search engine from scratch using C# that would rank websites based on &quot;how they looked&quot;. This involved looking at the various data structures required to store and retrieve this information, alongside figuring out how to rank pages on both content and their looks. To handle the looks, I took a screenshot of each page, reduced the size to around 100x100 and scanned the colours of each pixel to see if text would contrast. Alongside this I scanned the CSS of the page to check text colour and see if it matched the pixels; if it did, do a comparison against this. I can&#x27;t remember the exact algorithms I used, but if you used dark text on a dark background you&#x27;d get ranked down, and vice versa, alongside some other metrics.<p>The result was very crude, and looking back on it now the code was terrible. I had implemented the data structures myself, had a semi-decent crawler set up, and could sit all the tools alongside each other to crawl the Internet. Most importantly, it worked so I ended up getting decent marks! While the code makes me cringe, my write-up was fairly impressive, and I felt that writing 40k words over a year helped my writing ability considerably.",1420460984

From the point of view of development of treatments for aging, the most important divide is between programmed aging theories (a loud minority) and the view of aging as accumulated damage (the majority). A simplistic way of looking at it is to say that in the programmed aging view epigenetic change causes damage, while in the aging as damage view the damage is a side-effect of the normal operation of metabolism and leads to epigenetic changes as a reaction.<p>(This simplistic view obscures a lot of argument within programmed aging, just as there is a lot of argument within the aging as damage view. The author of this article has developed a novel evolutionary theory of programmed aging to compare and contrast with a range of others, such as the hyperfunction theory of aging).<p>At the present time we are entering an age of genetics. Whether the research community thinks of aging as a program or not is very important from the point of view of which treatments they try to chase. If aging is programmed, we&#x27;d expect damage repair to be of limited utility. If aging is accumulated damage, we&#x27;d expect attempts to change epigenetic patterns and gene expression levels to be of limited utility.<p>Strangely, despite the fact that most researchers think of aging as damage accumulation, the research community actually spends much more time on trying to catalog and alter epigenetic and gene expression changes - the path that clearly won&#x27;t have any great impact on the underlying causes of aging in that model. So if you do support programmed aging you should be pretty happy with the way things are going. If you don&#x27;t, you really shouldn&#x27;t: the field is heading in the wrong direction, for bad reasons. i.e. that it is easier to raise funds for the study and alteration of epigenetics, or the Big Pharma style development of drugs to do the same, which is the very hard exploration of how to safely alter a massively complex system that is very poorly understood, while it is much harder to raise funds to aim at rejuvenation through repair of damage, as this latter is a comparatively new approach in medicine.<p>So despite the fact that the majority of the field thinks that aging is damage, next to no groups work on damage repair. They are largely working on building a catalog of the precise way in which damage interacts with metabolism in great detail, a part of the ongoing process of producing a complete map of metabolism, a process that has only just started in the grand scheme of things: what we have today is just the sketch of an outline.<p>But that list of forms of damage that cause aging? That&#x27;s good and defensible and therapies could be built starting now, with a proposed ten year timeline to get to working prototypes in mice given $100m/yr funding. The whole and main point of the SENS strategies for aging is that we can skip over the need for full understanding of the detailed operation of metabolism and just fix the damage we know distinguishes old tissue from young tissue. This is the logical way to go if aging is thought to be damage. And yet it has taken a decade of advocacy to get even a small number of researchers in the field to support this approach. [3]<p>Want to prove whether aging is programmed or not? Implement SENS therapies, a clear and very detailed research program with a billion dollar price tag (much less than has already been spent on investigating sirtuins and mTOR, efforts that have produced nothing but knowledge of metabolism, and none of the promised treatments to modestly slow aging in healthy individuals). If that produces actual rejuvenation in mice, then aging is damage accumulation. If it doesn&#x27;t, then it is programmed. End of story, fastest way to the target, job done.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.senescence.info/aging_theories.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.senescence.info/aging_theories.html</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/about/leadership/research-advisory-board</a>",1420460270

We are all biased when deciding what is average as we use those around us to decide what is average - if we are surrounded by great programmers then our average is much higher than if we are surrounded by poor programmers.<p>The other complication is the intellectual energy hurdle that each problem brings. Some problems can only be solved by a small percentage of programmers, while others can be solved by anyone who can fog a mirror. How do we measure difference between programmers when the complexity of problems vary so much?",1420460258

They could be longer, but don&#x27;t for cultural and social reasons. With Culture stories though, I&#x27;m never quite sure if Culture society has genuinely agreed on it&#x27;s conventions freely, or if they are the result of subtle manipulation by the Minds (hyper-intelligent AIs that run the ships and habitats that host the Culture&#x27;s biological population).<p>For me if a population of immortals means a population without children I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s such a great idea. I&#x27;m concerned about intellectual, cultural and technological ossification and ultimately degeneration without a continually renewing population.<p>From a moral point of view, I don&#x27;t buy the idea that death is something horrific to be avoided at all costs. Historically it&#x27;s generally been accepted that there are things worth dying for, and countless throngs have sacrificed their lives, or at least willingly risked them, for causes they believed in. I&#x27;m specifically reminded of the case of a father a few years back that leaped in front of a lorry to push a child to safety, obviously knowing that he was sacrificing his own life to do so.<p>Human life is precious and valuable, but not infinitely so and it&#x27;s not obvious to me that an existing life is necessarily more valuable than a potential new one. I don&#x27;t expect it will be politicaly possible or desirable to suppress life extending treatments and I don&#x27;t really have any idea how this will all play out, but for me it&#x27;s not a foregone conclusion that a future in which it is normal to indefinitely extend life is an ideal one.",1420459644

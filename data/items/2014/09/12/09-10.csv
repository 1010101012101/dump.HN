8307298,comment,8306735,8306868,10,0,georgemcbay,,,"I disagree. I like it a lot, particularly if &quot;graded&quot; as a first public draft.<p>I&#x27;ll admit right up front that there is a lot of subjective bias here, different people learn in different ways and you will never please everyone.  So I&#x27;m not saying you are wrong, just that the guide appeals to me.<p>In terms of the A/B split on target audience:<p>A - Newbs) I&#x27;d argue that teaching people to code is way, way beyond the scope of any document like this, so the most logical starting target is someone who codes already but maybe doesn&#x27;t have a ton of experience and maybe it is in a language very different from the one the guide is presenting.  I think this guide hits that target pretty well as a straight-forward read.  There are nitpicky things that maybe could be better, but luckily online guides like this can be expanded and iterated on.<p>Obviously a newb isn&#x27;t going to understand something like what a &quot;closure&quot; is inherently, but they have the whole rest of the internet to tell them that when they see the term in this guide and then google it to fill in the blanks.<p>B - Non-Newbs) As an experienced programmer I think the guide is actually pretty great if you use the nicely presented ToC/index at the front as the primary interface to it.   Click a concept and boom, you&#x27;re looking at some nicely formatted example code along with some text that you can probably just skip over completely or skim because you already know what a closure is (for example) and just want to see the syntax for Rust.<p>I remain a diehard Go partisan for now, but I think this guide is actually superior in a lot of ways to the combination of the &quot;Go Tour&quot; and &quot;Effective Go&quot; which, cute mascot aside, are a bit too much on the dry/clinical side for me as introductory material to a language.",1410515839

Interesting, and a bit worrisome to think that some corporations could use this technology to get 16 hour days out of employees.<p>I am interested in the idea of continuing to &quot;work&quot; while sleeping. I&#x27;ve read anecdotes about people who solve technical problems in their dreams and the concept of getting a few more mental hours out of the day is very appealing. Time is arguably the most valuable resource and anything that can create more of it has potential to have a big impact. Hopefully this early result will turn into something bigger, ideally some kind of technology that allows people to communicate with themselves while sleeping. For that, I would pay a lot.<p>edit: Also, does this method have any value as a lie detector? Someone could ask a target true or false questions and record their EEG readings, and then ask a different set of questions while the target is asleep.

Many of the costs are going to be for things that do not scale linearly with building size.<p>For example, consider a single room building with a square floor plan.

It&#x27;s simpler to think of Monad as an interface for manipulating encapsulated data in a way which keeps it encapsulated.<p>The simplest way to encapsulate data is to wrap it using a constructor which we keep private to our module:<p><pre><code>    module M1 (Encap(), val1, val2)\n    data Encap a = mkEncap a\n\n    val1 :: Encap Int\n    val1 = mkEncap 5\n\n    val2 :: Encap Int\n    val2 = mkEncap 10\n</code></pre>\nOther modules importing M1 get access to the Encap type, val1 and val2 but <i>not</i> the mkEncap constructor. They can use val1 and val2 as-is, but they can&#x27;t construct new Encap values or destruct existing Encap values to get at their contents. The problem is, there&#x27;s not much we can do with this interface.<p>One way we can make this more useful is being able to apply some function to an encapsulated value. That&#x27;s what Functor is for, so we can add this to M1:<p><pre><code>    instance Functor Encap where\n      fmap f (mkEncap x) = mkEncap (f x)\n</code></pre>\nNow users of M1 can transform encapsulated values without being able to break the encapsulation. For example:<p><pre><code>    val1Plus7 :: Encap Int\n    val1Plus7 = fmap (+7) val1\n\n    val2Str :: Encap String\n    val2Str = fmap show val2\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re still pretty limited though, since there&#x27;s no way to combine encapsulated values into new encapsulated values, or to encapsulate our own values. That&#x27;s what Applicative provides, by letting us construct encapsulated values <i>without</i> gaining the ability to destruct them, and by allowing encapsulated functions to be applied to encapsulated values (since functions are closures, this lets us gather up encapsulated values and combine them arbitrarily):<p><pre><code>    instance Applicative Encap where\n      pure x = mkEncap x\n      (mkEncap f) <*> (mkEncap x) = mkEncap (f x)\n</code></pre>\nNow users of M1 can encapsulate and combine values, like this:<p><pre><code>    -- val1 + val2\n    val1PlusVal2 :: Encap Int\n    val1PlusVal2 = fmap (+) val1 <*> val2\n\n    -- New encapsulated string\n    val3 :: Encap String\n    val3 = pure &quot;Hello world&quot;\n\n    -- val3 repeated val1 times\n    val3Repeated :: Encap String\n    val3Repeated = fmap rep val1 <*> val3\n                   where rep n _ | n <= 0 = &quot;&quot;\n                         rep n s          = s ++ rep (n-1) s\n</code></pre>\nThis is quite a powerful interface, but one thing we can&#x27;t do is `collapse` double-encapsulated values into single-encapsulated values. That&#x27;s what Monad provides:<p><pre><code>    join :: Encap (Encap a) -> Encap a\n    join (mkEncap (mkEncap x)) = mkEncap x\n</code></pre>\nAn alternative, but equivalent, definition is to allow calls to encapsulation-producing functions without encapsulating their result. Haskell&#x27;s Monad is defined this way:<p><pre><code>    instance Monad Encap where\n      (>>=) :: Encap a -> (a -> Encap b) -> Encap b\n      (mkEncap x) >>= f = f x\n</code></pre>\nThese kind of encapsulated values turns out to hold effects without breaking the language, and these interfaces turn out to be powerful enough for general computation.",1410512922

That works because the landline network, when it is trunked, is compressed into 56kbps or 64kbps channels using methods the 56kbps modems were explicitly designed to take maximal advantage of.<p>Over a cell phone connection you will get much less. GSM data modems gets to bypass the voice codec, and are still limited to 9600 bps. An acoustic modem over a GSM connection will get less than that, if it will connect at all: A full data rate GSM code is compressing the audio down to about 12.2kbps using codecs geared towards reproducing voice as well as possible, which is going to be brutal to a regular modem and far more wasteful than GSM data.",1410512684

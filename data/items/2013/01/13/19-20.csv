Also, a lot of people with depression develop thoughts of suicide and the notion that it may be the only escape from the pain. So I wouldn't call Aaron's case ""textbook suicide"". One might reason that had he not been subject to such stress by our justice system his suicide would be delayed if not prevented, but I wouldn't go as far as saying he died knowing he would be a ""martyr"".

This doesn't work for code (or, perhaps, it doesn't work for the programming languages we have now---a programming language with syntax designed to be spoken, not typed, would be very interesting) and it seems it doesn't work for writing fiction, as I think I recall Charlie Stross discovering (can't find the blog posts now, though <a href=""http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/03/a-writing-experiment-i-plan-to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/03/a-writin...</a> discusses the problem). For day-to-day communication, though, the stylistic differences between dictated and typed prose are probably not important.<p>Moreover, this might yield a small efficiency win over both text communication as is (email, IM) and the telephone: dictated text would be as fast to produce as spoken communication (I can talk much faster than I can type, and I get the feeling that's true in general), while remaining as fast to read and as easy to edit as text.<p>I'm not sure this win would be very big, though; for me, at least, the bulk of the time I spend on writing is spent figuring out how to phrase things. Jackalope's comment, though, indicates that people are starting to see noticeable improvements in efficiency---the ""how did I ever live without this"" feeling. Perhaps they find speech more natural than typing, and spend less time agonizing over how to express themselves?<p>This scenario depresses me somewhat, as I have an inordinate and perhaps irrational fondness for slower, more considered forms of expression.

The prosecutor's job is <i>not</i> to zealously convict anyone they encounter with everything they can convict them with, it is to represent the interests of the people. There is no fathomable way that sending Aaron Swartz to prison for 35 years could possibly do that.<p>But let's not put all of the blame on the prosecutors. The prosecutors <i>did wrong</i> here, but we allowed it to happen by giving them the <i>authority</i> to do wrong. We are, as we speak, allowing laws to remain on the books that make ""crimes"" that should be a minor misdemeanor at worst (and not illegal at all at best) into felonies punishable by a sentence of imprisonment longer than the sentences received by many unrepentant criminals who have committed <i>premeditated murder</i>.<p>These outrageously disproportionate laws are what allowed these prosecutors to abuse their discretion. Get rid of the laws, or cut the penalties by a factor of a thousand, and you get rid of the problem. That should be the goal here. Making an example of these prosecutors is not a bad first step, but actually prohibiting what they did by removing their ability to levy outrageous charges at minor offenders has to be the long-term solution.",1358106143

(Perhaps those other expressions were themselves simply products of passing moods, or a calculated facade, but we have to assign them about as much credibility, as expressions of Aaron's rational thinking, as his suicide itself.)<p>Such inconsistency suggests to me that the suicide decision was the result of an irrational and possibly transient mood problem, and an <i>erroneous</i> assessment of likely future legal/incarceration outcomes.<p>(If some deep, emotional portion of the decisionmaking machinery goes wrong, and 'chooses' death, then subsequent painting-in of all the reasons that death <i>is</i> or <i>might be</i> a reasonable course can be an expression of choice-supportive biases.

5051560,comment,5051030,5051369,8,0,georgemcbay,,,"I'm okay with exposing channels as part of an API.  The problem was that in my experience doing async reads (especially where the data size is variable, not fixed) where you may have multiple possible callers reading from what is basically the same resource doesn't mesh too well with channels.<p>Say you have 3 goroutines, any of which might be requesting data from any/all of 3 connected I2C devices all on the same I2C bus.  They could signal a read over a channel and then have a return channel they look for the result on, but if there is a single channel per I2C bus, how do they know the result they see is the one they asked for? (As opposed to one being asked for by another goroutine also reading from that channel).  You can do it with some sort of token/id system but it gets complicated because if you read the data off the read channel and it isn't yours you have to stuff it back on there for others to read and make sure your goroutine isn't deadlocking everyone else out.<p>This is, of course, possible to work around while still using channels in many different ways.  One way is every time a client calls Read a new channel is created to return the results, but given that the data returned is of variable size and the underlying I2C layer requires you to pass in a pointer to the data buffer being used channels don't buy you much here.  Plus you end up with a lot more garbage to collect in the form of new channels being created each time Read is called, which is no big deal on a ""big"" computer, but when doing Go programming for smaller devices I do try to minimize the amount of garbage that needs to be collected.<p>When I first got into Go I wanted to do everything with channels and goroutines because where they fit they are awesome, but I've found the ""essence"" of Go is simplicity, not specific features, and sometimes a plain old mutex is just simpler than a more complex channel system.<p>And you can, of course, pretty trivially add channels on top of the I2C API like I do in the accel_dump example, where your code knows exactly what the access patterns of any single device will be (whereas the base I2C code doesn't really know or care).",1358105098

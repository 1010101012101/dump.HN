The Smalltalk vendors completely blew that opportunity and Java became the OO language of choice. There's still a significant amount of Smalltalk in banking, insurance and other big custom-software installations, but mostly it's a niche language now.<p>I think the ""Smalltalk is dead"" meme comes from all the ex-Smalltalkers out there. At one point they worked on some enterprise project in Smalltalk, but then switched over to Java when that became fashionable. They remember Smalltalk fondly, but won't use it for anything ""real"" anymore.<p>With the rise of the internet, niche languages are a lot more viable than they used to be, and so there's a small but vibrant community around the surviving Smalltalk implementations.",1243989478

638951,comment,638053,638891,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"What you say is all true, but only for stuff that comes from big-name bands or artists with the potential to be one. I do think there is quite a large community of bedroom producers/artists out there that will never get near a record deal or anything more substantial than tiny sales on iTunes or views on YouTube - less good musos who can't easily make out the chords (like myself) and those in the less profitable musical genres (electronic/dance and metal) where there are many, many more amateurs or hopefuls than successful acts. Anyway, I think there's a definite market for this plugin among the bedroom set. AU users (who I forgot abuot because I'm not a mac owner...oops) are more likely to pay money than VSTers, but a friendly Lite version will definitely drive sales of an affordable Pro version.<p>The Pro Tools folk will have little to no use for this plugin - let's face it, if you're paying for PT, you probably don't need the computer to help you with working out the chords. I think you're being a little unfair to Windows audio though. I used to produce on a full-size Pro Tools HD rig, but at home I've always been a Win/PC guy and don't find it limiting. I think the lean to Mac is just because they were the leader in that space for such a long time.<p>I was really surprised you didn't mention Ableton Live in your otherwise excellent roundup, though of course that's much more for dance than other DAWs.",1243988591
638950,comment,637996,638216,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I think the reason newspapers have declined so much, is merely the fact that they rely almost entirely on advertising to pay for the production and it's fairly inaccurate advertising. I mean your demographic targeting is exclusively to those who read, which in countries with 99% literacy rates, you're basically fucked for targeting. Where as you can pay less money to advertise online, reach less people but potentially have everyone who sees it interested.<p>Advertising on a bus is more demographically targeted than newspaper advertising, I mean generally lower income and likely don't own a vehicle. I don't own a drivers license, so why do I care about the new Ford Taurus, they just wasted money by advertising to me.<p>However, there's no advertising in book sales. Perhaps this is why for the past ten years they've had record sales. The internet has only helped book sales, and interestingly free eBook releases also boost sales.<p>The assumption that publishing is dead because of the internet is just stupid. We have ubiquitous clean water supplies, but people still ""waste"" money on bottled water. Plumbing isn't as useful to people as water in a bottle. Similarly, eBooks aren't as useful to people as books (at least so far).<p>Kindle and similar eBook readers offer promise to removing the paperback from its throne, but tangibility and freedom are key here. I can hand my book to anyone, I can sell it on and whatever I want, this creates the incredible ability for free advertising. Most of my books are from authors recommended to me, which usually involved the person handing me the book to me for me to read.<p>Also you can't advertise that you're intelligent and well read better than a bookshelf full of books. Then there's all the textile sensations that come with books.<p>While I don't doubt books will likely go the way of the newspaper. I highly doubt the end is nigh for bookpublishers when they have record sales. It just stinks of the BS spouted in the 50's that the end of the automobile would be soon because of how cheap air travel was becoming. I'm still not flying to work, so I'll laugh and ridicule the people who tell me book publishers are going to go out of business when they have record sales, just as everyone should have doubted we'd be flying to work when automobile manufacturers were posting record profits and more highways were being built than ever.<p>It just strikes me as ignorant, that so many tech news websites and the fanboys on them don't seem to grasp that newspapers and novels are far more different than Microsoft and Apple. You'd think people who can proclaim two computers so different would be capable of understanding a newspaper is not a book, alas apparently not.",1243988569

From what I've seen you write pretty clearly and lay your ideas out well.<p>Also, the linked article isn't that complex once you get past the first paragraph.  It's actually about discussing domain specific complex topics, and the first paragraph acts an example.  From then on it's written pretty clearly and the ideas are layed out well.  But at the end of the day it's more a thought / concern the guy had than an article.<p>It's not that the domain experts are all snooty and don't want to condescend to explain things properly.  It's that they have to make a choice about explaining things to those that are familiar with the domain - in which case they can be fairly concise and get whatever idea it is across with a minimal signal to noise ratio - or they can try for an explanation that anyone could understand - which might take more than a feasible amount of time, and carries a risk that the core idea that got them motivated enough to explain things in the first place would be lost amongst all the new information.<p>With that in mind, using a highly domain specific first paragraph as an example seems to be a highly effective way of a communicating the idea - if it was at the end, or in the middle and the reader was told it was an example then people would have skipped or skimmed it. The stakes wouldn't be high enough.  You don't know that because you didn't read the article - kind of amusing since you subsequently accused the author of having a lazy attitude :)<p>Anyhow, it seems liked you were offering advice between authors of similarly complex works which is what caused some cognitive dissonance in me.  Maybe you've written equally complex works before, but it feels to me that if you haven't then you can't know if your advice scales to the higher complexity description.<p>I would argue that most of your subjects are reasonably straightforward but perhaps discussed less clearly elsewhere.  I didn't see any data or graphs showing lost opportunity costs and probabilities of succes in the ""College vs Startup"" entry for instance - which for my money would make it more of a complex subject, radically more useful while still being easily explainable.  As it is pretty much anyone could have written it - perhaps with a different style - but it doesn't seem like it's coming from a domain expert.<p>The merchant account article is the exception amongst them, I'm sure that's very useful for the people who are looking at getting a merchant account.<p>Maybe we just have different levels for what we count as complex, which is fine.",1243988404

638937,comment,638607,638709,0,0,DougBTX,,,"> I could definitely see using this format for detection<p>Why have any gaps between the keys at all?<p>On a physical keyboard, you want gaps for at least a couple of reasons: so that your fingers can feel the edges, and so that you don't accidently click on two keys at once. Triangular keys might make some sense on a physical keyboard then, since presumably you would be able to press inside the combined area of the key's triangle and the two adjacent triangular gaps, so less chance of pressing two keys at once.<p>On a soft keyboard, you can't feel the edges of the keys, so the first point doesn't apply anymore. The second worry, pressing two keys at once, also doesn't apply, since the software calculates the centre point of the finger press, and activates the key which that point falls over, rather than all the keys under your finger.<p>With a soft key pad then, the only real way to make keys easier to press is to make them bigger. The iPhone for example, will increase the effective size of the keys that you are likely to press next, predicted based on language settings.<p>So, it probably hasn't been implemented for a soft key pad because it would make it harder to press the keys. You would press roughly in the right place, and get no response.<p>As for physical key pads, I notice that the Blackberry has keys with raised diagonals. That probably gets you most of the advantages of triangular keys (easier to feel them apart) without the need to actually make them triangular.<p><a href=""http://3466.voxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/8820-keyboard.jpg?host=vox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3466.voxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/8820-keybo...</a>",1243987975

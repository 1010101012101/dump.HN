The number of high-rise buildings constructed?  That says more about how little buildable land Japan has than it says about the strength of the Japanese economy.<p>The article also mentions electricity ""output"" (a.k.a. consumption), which has grown faster in Japan than in the US.  The article spins it as an indicator of the strength of the Japanese economy, but you could just as easily describe it as a success story about US conservation efforts.<p>And some of it is just strange.  Michelin ratings as a measure of the strength of an economy?  Cultural factors matter as much as economic strength, there.<p>Japan might actually be doing better than people in the US think, but this article isn't a good argument for that position.",1326034529

I feel like upon launch if this service becomes successful that someone else will be hired for that position and will be given more of a stake in the company that I currently hold, even though I've been doing all the work in developing the product/platform from scratch.<p>Is this standard operating procedure?  I know titles right now are irrelevant since we haven't yet launched publicly or even in a limited beta, but I want to make sure I don't get screwed out of a position that I feel I deserve.  What is a standard stake of equity for employee #1 who happens to be the technical developer creating the product/service?  I'm kind of naive when it comes to money and equity since I'm only 23 and this is my first startup, so I kind of just agreed with whatever was given, because up until now I had no past startup experience so I wasn't sure what to expect and figured anything was better than nothing.<p>Also to mention that we haven't yet raised any outside VC funding, it's all self-funded by the co-founders right now, but one of the co-founders has connections with VCs from his past job",1326033443

Either way, my productivity, savings, and future goals need to be harmonized for my plans to come to fruition.
Most responsible, productive people find it very easy to return to the workforce. Sometimes they are a step down or two (as in the case of my mother, who was a former research manager at IBM before she had my brother and me) but if their skills haven't eroded, they quickly gain back, and even exceed their position (she's now fairly high up at AT&T managing the internet pipes between Asia and the Americas, as well as VPN services to huge companies like Siemens).<p>what you are saying here is that, although having children is typically something that two people do, the onus falls on the woman to bear the career hit, and have to run faster and harder to return to the same place.",1326033109

Every time I've watched someone at the store play with a WP7 they just immediately move on to the more ""glossier"" home screens of iPhone/Android.  If it requires them to add embellishments to the home screen for the sake of sales despite violating a Metro design principle then that's what needs to be done.  You have to give people what they like/want and not be stubborn about sticking to certain principles and/or give options in addition to Metro if you're struggling and about to go down in flames.<p>3) Treat developers better.  Right now there's so much uncertainty in the WP7 development ecosystem wrt Silverlight and XAML/C#.  Personally I'm at stalemate on the platform as I don't know if it's a waste of time to focus on XAML/C# if Silverlight/WPF is going to die, and whether all of that is going to be replaced with HTML/JS and/or WinRT/C++.  Maybe after a year or two the dust will settle and the messaging for what to use for development will become clearer.  But that's a significant time of lost opportunity to market share as developers will just stick to Objective-C for iPhone or Java for Android to avoid wasting time throwing away XAML/C# code for later HTML/JS, WINRT/C++, etc...",1326031554

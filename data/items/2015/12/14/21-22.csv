Is there a logical flow from A to B?<p>It would have been interesting to be &quot;a fly on the wall&quot; and see how some of these evolved over time.

But they have the money to walk and chew worker-bees, so we&#x27;ll probably see both.<p>( This is getting further afield, but. Do we even have a semi-reasonable comparison for a bundle of legal and societal changes involved in self-driving transport? I can&#x27;t think of one outside of the original introduction of cars. And on the legal side, that was mostly new law, not revising the assumption of human action across criminal, tort, insurance and whatever other categories. The analogous social changes - at first, demonizing pedestrians to get them off streets; later, suburbs, the propaganda tying the car to U.S. American notions of freedom, towns becoming dependent on violations for income, etc. - are somewhat harder to make bets about, but more interesting.<p>There certainly have been bigger changes (I&#x27;m guessing, of course, but I don&#x27;t see auto-autos as a bigger deal than agriculture), but I don&#x27;t know that legal codes were as complex then, and I know we don&#x27;t have extensive records on the changes.

I can&#x27;t think of any good reason why in a case like this, where it has both patent and copyright claims, that the appeals need to go to the same court.

Holding separate trials in different courts would be wasteful, annoying, and could get complicated and troubling if different courts found different facts.<p>Those considerations mostly do not apply at the appellate level.

The main contribution here is to use a JIT with inline caches (Truffle VM) to optimize change propagation.  That&#x27;s some cool work, but it comes at a cost in flexibility and power, at least with the current state of the project.  The framework supports only static graphs that only grow (no removing nodes), and changes must be single source (no &quot;transactions&quot; that handle several changes simultaneously).  Those limitations are enough to make this probably not useful in &quot;the real world.&quot;  As a research project, though, using JIT w/ ICs to optimize propagation seems really promising.",1450128906

It made sense because workers of a common trade share experiences and grievances. If one particular employer treated its workers bad, that trade guild had more leverage by threatening work stoppage against other employers who could put pressure on the first employer.<p>Over time employers started to converge and grow in power. Now you have a company who employs thousands of people in multiple locations. To keep the balance in power, the unions converged and grew in power. You cant threaten to replace a union worker if everyone who does that job is in the union(1).<p>Now the unions are big enough to disrupt economies, sway elections, etc. They are large professional entities of lawyers, financial managers. They want everyone in the union for maximal leverage (ie fewer scabs, more dues) so they lobbied to affect the policies we have today.<p>The small voluntary no-admin-overhead organization you are describing is ideal, but its really unlikely to work.

They typically dim the screen brightness through the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) operating at the frequency of approximately 240 Hz. This is the same kind of low-frequency PWM found on early LED-backlit LCD displays that some users reported to cause them more eye strain than their previous CCFL-backlit monitors. I have not seen any medical study examining their complaints but companies like BenQ responded by publicly announcing  &quot;flicker-free&quot; (i.e., PWM-free) monitors while others made the change quietly in their new product lines. We&#x27;ve seen PWM in LED backlights either phased out or configured to operate at higher frequencies (often >1000 Hz).<p>For an introduction to the whole PWM business, read <a href=""http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation....</a>.

10734001,comment,10731231,10733574,0,0,mwcampbell,,,"I seriously doubt that using Python bytecode rather than native code makes the application more lightweight. Here are the problems I see:<p>1. Code size: Bytecode instructions may be more compact than their native code counterparts, since the bytecode instructions are dealing with higher-level abstractions. But the dynamism of Python prevents some major optimizations. First, the bytecode has to include identifiers, since everything is late-bound. More importantly, a packaged Python application tends to include a lot of dead code, because the packaging tool can&#x27;t accurately tell what modules, let alone individual functions, are actually used. And that&#x27;s assuming you&#x27;re using something like py2exe which at least tries to prune the set of distributed modules.<p>2. Startup time: Of course, even native code can vary here. If you have an executable that&#x27;s statically linked except for OS libraries, the OS can just read that executable into memory and jump to the entry pooint; that&#x27;s fast even for a cold start. But if your application consists of an executable plus several DLLs or shared libraries, the OS has to do a lot more work to get it loaded. Python modules tend to be more fine-grained than typical DLLs, and for each module, the interpreter has to find it on the search path, then open the file and read it.<p>3. Memory footprint: Native code is mapped into memory as shared read-only pages. The OS doesn&#x27;t actually have to add any of those pages to the working set until they&#x27;re executed, and it can page them out at any time without having to write to a swap file, which mobile platforms don&#x27;t have. A few bytecode interpreters, most notably Dalvik, have managed to exploit this, but not Python. So all the Python bytecode has to be in memory all of the time. This is exacerbated by the limited ability to trim the code size as described above.<p>More generally, my thinking on performance, especially perceived performance, in end-user applications has been heavily influenced by this blog post:<p><a href=""http://chadaustin.me/2009/02/logic-vs-array-processing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chadaustin.me/2009/02/logic-vs-array-processing/</a><p>Here&#x27;s the money quote:<p>> With disk and memory speeds improving so much more slowly than CPU speeds, the difference between a snappy desktop application and a sluggish application is a handful of page faults. When choosing a technology platform for a project, it’s worth considering the impact to overall responsiveness down the road. And I’m pretty sure I just recommended writing your entire application in C++, which sounds insane, even to me. I’ll leave it at that.<p>That post was several years old. These days I&#x27;d expect him to recommend Rust over C++.<p>Of course, you&#x27;ve been developing software for a long time, and you&#x27;ve actually used Python in a mobile app; I haven&#x27;t. So maybe the issues I&#x27;ve raised just don&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;m particularly curious if startup time has been an issue for Inky at all, especially on the mobile platforms.",1450128316

These are library functions, so their names must be carefully chosen to imply only what the contract of the actual method supports. In particular:<p><pre><code>    Executors.instantiateThreadManager()\n</code></pre>\nYou lose information about the thread count (single thread). Also, a nitpick I know, but in Java new means instantiate, so just say new and save typing. Also, an executor is not guaranteed to be a thread manager in any meaningful sense. It is only guaranteed to be an Executor.<p><pre><code>    exec.queueForAsyncExecution()\n</code></pre>\nThis may not actually be async. 9/10 it is, but the interface does not guarantee async, just a de-coupling from queuing and execution.<p><pre><code>    exec.executeQueued()\n</code></pre>\nThis misses the fact that calling shutdown will deny future tasks from being queued after it is called.<p>This is actually a great example of why function names are not a sufficient replacement for appropriate comments.",1450127496

Guns allow for the physically weak to still have a chance to defend themselves.  On NPR I remember calling for the police to help as her ex was breaking into the home.  They didn&#x27;t have anyone anywhere near by and the woman had no weapons on her.  The boyfriend ended up breaking in and attacking her quite badly.  He didn&#x27;t need a weapon and a weapon wouldn&#x27;t have made what he did any worse, but it might have given her the chance for the victim to defend herself or scare him off.",1450127073

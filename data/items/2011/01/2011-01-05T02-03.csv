2069635,comment,2069477,2069477,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"You can learn a lot in 6 to 12 months, but you probably shouldn't expect to become a skilled developer in that time period. There are a lot of edge cases that you just have to experience to understand, and you'll never stop experiencing them, as long as you're programming.<p>These days, my advice -- if I felt qualified to give any, which I don't -- would be to decide now whether you want to be ""a programmer"", or ""a (COBOL | Python | Ruby | PHP | Java | JavaScript | .NET) programmer"". That is, decide whether you want to learn the principles of programming, and apply those to multiple languages, or whether you want to learn a language, and specialize in it.<p>If you choose to be a generalist, then you'll be able to more easily pick up new languages and work in alien frameworks, because everything you look at will be similar to something else you already understand. You won't be as good as someone who specializes in that particular language or framework, but you'll be good enough to get a job and do reasonably well at it. The flexibility will also make it easier for you to find jobs, assuming that you're able to sell your generalism as an advantage instead of a disadvantage.<p>If you choose to specialize, you might not ever understand certain low-level programming concepts, but if someone needs work done in your language or framework of choice, you'll be able to knock it out without any concern about how long it'll take you to familiarize yourself with the environment.<p>This decision will probably mostly be the result of your own mindset -- whether you prefer puzzles or stability -- as well as whether you'd rather aim for a job as a consultant (or freelancer) or a regular job as an employed programmer for some company.<p>If you decide to be a generalist, I'd recommend spending a couple of months learning basic concepts in an ""easy"" language (PHP, VisualBasic, Pascal), and then diving into C and then C++. By then you should be able to relate most languages to one of the couple you've worked with, and you'll have a better idea of what to learn next. You'll also develop a solid understanding of types, stacks, heaps, object frameworks, and on and on.<p>If you decide to specialize, then honestly the best recommendation I'd have would be to hit some of the job sites, see what people are looking for (and willing to pay for), then get some real, actual books on that particular language and dive in.<p>Your background in math and physics will help you when it comes to thinking analytically, but programming is still a whole other level of analytical thinking.<p>Good luck!",1294196061

2069631,comment,2069341,2069525,0,0,cletus,,,"It's naive and inaccurate to view copyright (or, in fact, any form of intellectual property) as an absolute right.<p>The state allows IP so that creators can be rewarded for their efforts in the hopes that this will allow various industries to flourish.<p>But such IP has limits. Patents can't be granted on certain things. For example, India does not allow patents on certain (all?) pharmaceuticals because it views low-cost health care for its citizens as being more in the national interest.<p>The US does not allow the patenting of nuclear technology.<p>Copyright has term limits, typically being X years after the death of the creator, although lobbying has steadily increased this limit (the so-called ""Mickey Mouse"" law).<p>The idea is that at some point copyrighted works will pass into the public domain because that's in the public's interest without needlessly enriching countless descendants of the creators.<p>Copyright has other limits: fair use, use by nonprofits, education use and so on.<p>You may not even be aware that there is such a thing as <i>compulsory licensing</i> [1], which allows you to pay statutory royalties and use something without permission for certain enumerated purposes.<p>Basically, copyright (or any IP for that matter) is not absolute. So we're simply haggling over what those limits are.<p>As an aside, the content creators themselves, apart from a very few, don't derive significant economic benefit from their works (particularly in the music industry). What you're really doing is simply protecting the intermediaries (being the record companies).<p>So arguing that they have the right is not only incorrect but it misses the point entirely: those rights exist by the grace of the state for the perceived (alleged?) national interest.<p>""Stifling innovation"" is not really something worth arguing about (in the sense of having a right to do so). Any protected industry fighting the tide still loses in the end. The genie never goes back in the bottle.<p>Look at the millions spent on lobbying Congress to pass crazy laws, abuse of the judicial system for mass lawsuits, PR campaigns and so on. Have they stamped out piracy? No. Have they killed the idea of and the desire to download content over the Internet so we can all go back to buying CDs from the corner record store? Hardly.<p>The writing is on the wall. So legislation is important too obviously but here it's only an issue because the various industries are so intransigent to the inevitability of change.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://copyright.gov/circs/circ73.pdf</a>",1294195963

Dirt; which is the home of such wonderful things as anthrax. I hate to use a scare tactic, but anthrax, as well as a host of other nasty vermin like MRSA, live in the soil. I know because my family owns a landscaping business, which means a lot of time spent in the dirt, and by consequence, knowledge of such infections. Bathing is good. Soap is good. Anti-bacterial-soap-with-ultra-lathering-action (tm) is probably a bit of an overkill, but I'm not convinced that it will be the end of our species.<p>On the topic of brushing your teeth and the ancestral diet, it's worth considering that our hunter/gatherer ancestors (Paleolithic) -- those who enjoyed the diet most frequently referred to as ""ancestral"" -- only lived to see 33 years of age on average. Without refined sugars and acidic soda, the primary danger to your teeth was biting down on a the hard pit of a fruit, or having them knocked out by prey that turned on you.

So they found a solution: DMCA, that would cover what they wanted to do as long as they responded to labels who didn't want their music and they had deniabilty when it came to how the copyrighted content ended up on their service: users uploading.<p>So they had a problem (""how to stream music that requires rights to stream without those rights"") and they found a solution (""dmca"") and used the requirements of the dmca (""users uploading and removing when requested"") to shape their service.

I installed BeOS and used it for about 2 years (no joke) back in the day. LOVED IT. I even had it replace my Slackware instance for about 6 months as my primary system.<p>2. I love seeing OSes still actively developed even if they aren't popular. I think it keeps driving ingenuity and pushes other people. But, I don't get why we have to have rewritten older systems...lets try to advance OSes.<p>3. The interface has to go. It was clunky back then and now it is downright horrendous compared to nearly any interface we have. Gnome might feel like 2004, but this feels like 1997.<p>4. The biggest problem with BeOS back in the day was lack of applications. I don't see this being fixed with Haiku unless they have translation layer.<p>EDIT - 
One thing I forgot to mention about BeOS back in the day. It booted in about 15 seconds. It was amazing. Right now the fastest I've seen is an Ubuntu box getting from start to internet in about 7 seconds w/ a SSD etc but for 1999/2000, it was amazing. Astonishing, really.<p>I would also add in this edit that I think the state of UI on current OSes is a bit disappointing. I think Ubuntu is trying w/ Unity and even that has a ways to go before I see any real innovation in interfaces. It feels like we've got a modality that worked 15 years ago and we've sort of massaged it, but haven't really innovated or pivoted on the concept too well.",1294193513

And Minesweeper.<p>I can imagine a niche for high-density ARM-based servers running IIS, but, unless licensing is very cheap, I cannot imagine someone paying for Windows on four ARM blades when the same Windows on one x86 blade could do the same work. When licensing is a big part of the whole stack, the hardware evolves in weird, sometimes unpractical, ways.<p>That happened before too. When the most common Windows version (because it could run lots of popular software), was the 9x series, x86 processors were under specific evolutionary pressures and ended up with deep pipelines and insanely high clocks to remain acceptably fast until past 2000 (and entered an evolutionary dead-end). At the same time, RISC-based boxes that ran Unix routinely had more than one processor since the low 90's.

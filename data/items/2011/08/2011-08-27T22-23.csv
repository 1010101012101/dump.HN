It focused on test and measurement equipment for engineers and scientists. The computer and printer sections of the company were created to fulfill the needs of that niche. When personal computers took off and the computer and printer divisions grew, the management thought than in the lusty days of the dotcom boom it would be best to split into two companies. Their rationale at the time was that it was too hard to manage a consumer products business and a industrial products business at the same time. Though, the tech stock market fever at that time was probably the probably the real reason.<p>HP's history after that is well known. Carly Fiorina has been vilified for destroying Bill and Dave's company, but at least she wasn't responsible for the split. Since the split, years of mismanagement have led it to where it is today.<p>Agilent, meanwhile at least pays some lip service to the ""HP Way.""

To the extent that the real Hewlett-Packard still exists, Agilent is the real Hewlett-Packard. (The company spun itself into two parts in the 1990s.)<p>And so it's painful to read all these stories about how the HP Way is dead dead dead, about how the company founded by Bill and Dave has been trashed, et cetera. In fact, the company founded by Bill and Dave isn't quite dead. It just donated the HP name -- and entirely too many unfortunate employees -- to this now-completely-different company that has since been run into the ground.<p>Agilent, as far as I know, is still chugging along. Unlike this thing-now-known-as-HP, it still makes test equipment, descended from the test equipment that Bill and Dave built in their garage. I suspect that, in true HP tradition, its products continue to be fairly expensive, culturally distinct, equipped with voluminous and sometimes mysterious documentation, occasionally quirky to the point of hysterical laughter, and utterly indispensable in their particular niches.",1314482712

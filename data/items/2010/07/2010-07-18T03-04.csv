1525146,comment,1524485,1524485,0,0,apsurd,,,"I was finally able to understand REST by learning ruby on rails, specifically going through this tutorial here: <a href=""http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a><p>So REST is a ""standard and accepted"" way of structuring your URL paths to make them make intuitive sense. Of course thats not the literal definition. You'll see the term ""Resource"" thrown around.  At a basic level, ""things"" on the internet like a single static web page article, or a single user signed up for a service would known as a ""resource"".<p>Let's use a blog as an example. A blog has ""authors"", ""posts"", and ""comments"". These can all be identified as resources of a website. 
Now think of the interactions you are likely to do with a resource. CRUD comes to mind: Create, Read, Update, Delete.<p>So a RESTful implementation of a simple blog would have an intuitive URL structure that allowed you to Cread, Read, Update, and Delete ""resources"".<p>Consider these urls:<p><pre><code>  myblog.com/posts/1
  myblog.com/posts/1/edit
</code></pre>
This url structure is the start of a RESTful application. A ""post"" resource can be identified by its unique id here.<p>One thing that I was unclear about was that you can send different types of ""commands"" over http right in the header. For example even though<p><pre><code>  myblog.com/posts/1 
</code></pre>
is just one url, you can actually do multiple things with it:
  GET, POST, PUT, DELETE<p>So depending on the headers you send, your application can do different things. REST recommends that you GET when you want to ""read"" a blog post, you PUT when you want to update a resource, and DELETE, when you need to delete the resource.<p>The myblog.com/1/edit  is not actually sending the editing commands, its simply GETting the edit ""view"". The form then should issue a PUT command to update the resource.<p>Hope this makes sense, I've go to go now but I can clarify if you have any more questions.",1279422509

I have a general impression of how people play, but I couldn't tell you about a hand I played 30 minutes ago or what anybody did in the hand exactly.  On Provigil, however, the game becomes absolutely crystal clear and I can tell you what hand you played 4 hours ago or 4 minutes ago in striking clarity.  Really creative playing goes out the window though and I become a very ABC player with the advantage of total recall.  I've never had a losing session on Provigil, but I've also never 4x or 5x buyin session on it either (making 4x or 5x my initial buyin) which is probably due to the fact that I play smaller pots because I'm not taking as many risks.<p>I can stop taking it for months, go on a ""binge"" and then stop taking it again.

A decentralized, federated social-networking platform that would allow individual sites to include social-networking features, but where all the ""social stuff"" could be federated through API's, so that a user had access to his/her entire social graph, no matter which site he/she was logged into.  This was a semi-novel idea 3 years ago, but now everybody and his brother is writing a decentralized social-network. <shrug /><p>2. This has maybe be done, not sure, but I was intrigued by the idea of a robotic avatar that could be used for remote conferencing.  That is, a small robotic device with a camera, microphone, and speakers, where the head could pivot to scan the room and look up and down, etc...  the idea being, if I'm hosting a teleconference in my conference room, and 3 people are ""virtual"" attendees, I plug 3 of these things in, and the remote conferencing software attaches a session to 1 per remote user, and lets them interact with the other people.  Didn't really put much thought into what it would look like or what other functions it might have... but it wouldn't be fair to let the virtual attendees shoot at the others with frickin' lasers, if the others can't shoot back somehow.

Up until this very argument, the suggestion that people (for instance) stick djbdns dnscache on their laptops instead of using (say) OpenDNS resulted in a spew of FUD about straining the root servers. Either way, it's irrelevant; at the same time we roll out laptop DNS caches, let's also give everyone two factor authentication and a pony too.<p>2. You need to acquaint yourself with Dan Bernstein's presentation on NSEC3, but I think we can trust each other that we're not simply making things up. Like I said, NSEC3 --- the solution to zones being OVERTLY walkable --- creates a crackable ""zone password file"" that everyone can download.<p>3. The lack of UI for dealing with DNS failure is an artifact of the fact that the DNS was never meant to be secure, and so trying to layer an incredibly complicated security service model on it is a bad idea. Saying ""that's up to the vendors to agree on"" is, like the ""sufficiently optimizing compiler"", the very definition of hand-waving.<p>4. Those people who think that SSL CA's can be replaced by a vending machine built into the DNS are --- excuse the hyperbolic tone --- delusional. This suggestion not only doesn't solve the problem of how crappy vetting is for certificates, but actively amplifies it.<p>5. Wrong. If you are (for instance) a YC networking startup, you are going to pay through the nose in admin BS to deal with the hassles and failures created by this system which will cost billions of dollars across the board to deploy and which won't solve problems.",1279422086

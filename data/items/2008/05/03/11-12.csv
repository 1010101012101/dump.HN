On the other hand, Microsoft might come back and offer the $40 or $50 million it would take to make the VCs agree (I think it would be a good idea for them to do so) and they’ll be buying beach house and Bentleys.""<p>Let's say an angel would invest at the same valuation as the VC, then for $1M they would get 12.5% of the company. That would mean that when acquired for $20M, founders are left with $17.5M. For VCs with 50% stake and $40M acquisition founders are left with $20M. Not sure where Bentley's come from.",1209815304

Indeed, a larger proportion of tech founders are middle-aged, well-educated in business or technical disciplines, with degrees from a wide assortment of schools. Twice as many U.S.-born tech entrepreneurs start ventures in their fifties as do those in their early twenties, as this paper will show.""",1209815293

Right now I spend that time reading RSS or watching last night's Daily Show, trying to get my brain going. But I've been thinking about doing something more intellectual to get up to speed faster. My best idea so far is to solve 1 or 2 Project Euler problems each morning. Any other suggestions?",1209812454

10178968,comment,10177775,10177775,0,0,bane,,,"I keep hearing about how miserable things are in academia and have come to perhaps a surprising conclusion: research and education need to be broken up. I know that there&#x27;s arguments that the two should stay entangled, and that new research feeds quickly into education blah blah blah. But I personally think that the world is far better off with large, dedicated, quasi-commercial R&D labs and institutions like Xerox-Parc, Bell Labs, Howard Hughes Medical, Battelle, Microsoft Research etc. and that those research labs operate off of a &quot;licensed innovation&quot; model.<p>It feels like these places are struggling (I might be wrong), but I&#x27;d argue for a vast expansion of this system on par with the university system, but without either being burdened by the needs of either one. Offer competitive industry pay and work on demand for commercial and public interest.<p>A kind of kernel of this already exists, either big National Labs that try to spin out mature research paths into companies (giving the researches a shot at making it big as CEO or CTO of these new companies) or as dedicated commercial R&D firms that get hired to produce product ideas for commercialization. But I think it should be institutionalized in the same way universities are rather than running as independent as they do now. And then universities should get out of the research game altogether.<p>I don&#x27;t have real concrete ideas on how this should be done, but it would provide a better career track for smart people.",1441572851

That being said, Csound has a much better collection of sound modules.<p>Not exactly the answer you were looking for, but I hope you can check them both out, as they offer different approaches to computer music composition.",1441571983

Instead I&#x27;d invite you to ask yourself: Could this argument have something to it despite the fact that it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable?<p>Going on, why does getting behind this make us look good? It shows that:<p>* we are not ignorant of questionable business practices in our field<p>* we don&#x27;t prey on the (intellectually) weak in order to sustain our businesses<p>* we value ideals like craft more than money (ignoring that most of these practices are not driven by greed at all but are the only way to ensure the survival of some companies, which brings me to the next point, that)<p>* we are not afraid to &quot;stick it to the man&quot; (even though &quot;the man&quot; is probably a complete strawman and we don&#x27;t have to fear any real retaliation for expressing this opinion)<p>Now there is nothing wrong with advice that makes us look good per se, but is it also good advice?<p>> People&#x27;s capacity for bullshit is rapidly diminishing<p>Again, this may sound good, but it could have been said at any point in time and be true, the question is: Is it diminishing faster then new ways of bullshitting arise?<p>And maybe it is not diminishing at all. Take gambling for example. It is obviously &quot;intentionally deceptive or insincere&quot; in that it won&#x27;t make you rich, it is in fact mathematically proven to make you lose money, yet people seem to have gambled for thousands of years and will probably go on to do so for thousands of years to come.<p>The attempt of linking bullshit to Sturgeon&#x27;s law is also pretty weak IMO. It&#x27;s not like anybody set out to put something in the bottom 90%, it&#x27;s what happens to, well, 90% of things, and it&#x27;s not at all clear that it was BS that put it there.\nIn other words: Naively looking at the top 10% and saying: &quot;None of those is doing BS&quot; does not mean the lack of BS got them there. All it says is that &quot;In the top 10% you don&#x27;t have to BS (because you can afford not to)&quot;, or even just &quot;BS doesn&#x27;t get you any further in the top 10% (and that&#x27;s why nobody is doing it)&quot;.<p>Finally, Buzzfeed is certainly in the top 10% of &quot;lighthearted entertainment on the internet&quot; and it is BS (and only BS) that got them there, because that&#x27;s the kind of environment that &quot;lighthearted entertainment on the internet&quot; is like. No amount of shaming will change anything about that (but would still make us look good, so produce some quality content over there already!).<p>tl,dr: Be aware of advice that sounds good.

Attempts to physically get inside the chip to do so will destroy the keys. You have to communicate with the software running onboard.<p>But the software running onboard is, well, just software. It&#x27;s common for applets to want a PIN before performing signing or decryption operations, and to lock out further attempts after N bad PIN entries. Yubikeys were vulnerable for a while to a logical flaw in the applet that let you trick it into signing without the PIN. Presumably applets can have buffer overflows and logical flaws just like everyone else; it&#x27;s not inconceivable that you could get remote code execution inside the smart card by talking to it the right way. If implemented correctly, you still shouldn&#x27;t be able to get the key this way, but you can use it. Also, while there exist readers with onboard PIN keypads, most people type their pins into desktop software that you could phish or keystroke log with remote code execution on the client PC, then have remote use of the card as long as it&#x27;s connected to a compromised machine.<p>There&#x27;s also generally a layer (or two) of administrative PIN/PUK codes so organizational administrators can reset forgotten user PINs. This is sort of a problem for the military when people in remote postings lock themselves out of their computers are there are no sufficiently privileged IT guys around. Some organizations can do this remotely, which is (probably) cryptographically secure but vulnerable to social engineering if you can steal a card and convince remote support to give you a PIN reset code. There&#x27;s also another code that&#x27;s necessary to replace applets. All of these are presumably vulnerable to being left at their factory defaults, being leaked by a careless administrator, etc. and not easy to rotate if compromised.<p>HID iClass (smart card-ish proximity physical access control) credentials are supposed to be impossible to clone without a cryptographic key, for example, except the same key is embedded in every HID reader. You can rip one off a wall, JTAG it, get the key, and sign arbitrary cards for any building that hasn&#x27;t bothered to generate a facility-specific key (and almost no one has).<p>In a stored value card application, you probably can&#x27;t get inside the card and flip a bit to give yourself $1,000,000. But there&#x27;s a much better chance you can figure out the protocol spoken by vending machines and impersonate one. Security through obscurity is common here, and if cryptography is used the private keys in the vending machines may well be sitting in RAM in Windows XP on a subway platform, or crypto primitives may have been chosen incorrectly, or keys may be available by social-engineering the manufacturer.<p>Smart cards aren&#x27;t a panacea. As some CIO-focused trade press mentions, most real-world breaches don&#x27;t involve stealing authentication credentials. Having super-secret SSH keys doesn&#x27;t help you if I can get a shell through PHP. But it is a hell of a lot easier for an attacker to get your SSH private key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa than from your smart card - at worst the smart card would let him <i>use</i> it.<p>BTW, you <i>can</i> generate the keypair on a computer (preferably an air-gapped one) and load it onto a smart card. This would let you have backups. But most applications are for authentication; there is no need to have a backup because administrators can simply associate a new card with the account. Server-side HSMs have different properties.&#x27;<p>(I am not a security expert, just taken an interest in this recently.)",1441571766

(It might be more parallel if Hawking&#x27;s parents specifically had a goal of producing more and more intelligent human beings, and genetically engineered their children to try to make that happen.) Human reproduction involves a lot of random variation and not a lot of goals, expertise, or the wherewithal to achieve them.<p>2- I think this is an interesting point about possible inherent computational limits on the ability to solve some problems that we might care about, including in designing more intelligent machines.<p>3- This is something people have thought about quite a lot. What superintelligent machines do depends on what they&#x27;ve been programmed to do. It&#x27;s very unlikely that an AI would inherently value &quot;diversity&quot; or &quot;fate&quot; unless it were programmed to do so. The AI wouldn&#x27;t spontaneously create new values (unless it were programmed to). Most concerns about AIs that exterminate humanity are based in the possibility that an AI would fulfil other goals in a surprising or unanticipated way, with bad side-effects for human survival.<p>4- Intelligence helps people wage war and dominate others more violently, both by coordinating better to do so (including motivating people to join in), and by developing new technology that helps make larger-scale violence cheaper. Weapons research can help you learn how to kill more people faster and at lower cost. A superintelligent AI could engage in this kind of research if it saw an important reason to.<p>5- I think that&#x27;s exactly right; perhaps the important difference here is that the machine version would be more flexible (if you wanted to try overclocking it, or modifying the software somehow). This is dangerous and expensive and confusing to do with a physical brain, because it&#x27;s hard to manipulate the details of its organization and structure, and because you can just die if you mess up. Think of the ease with which you can edit a PNG or SVG file in a computer compared to editing an oil painting.

Actually the seeds of their downfall came earlier when they decided they needed to monetize and kill anyone else that was earning money by leveraging Twitter.  But being public and having to listen to Wall Street where they are judged by <i>Facebook&#x27;s</i> chosen KPI is the thing that will prevent Twitter from realizing its potential.<p>The thing about Twitter is that to this day, no one really understands what it is.  It is stable only because the investors have been beating this drum for Twitter to explain and define itself.    But whether you talk to founders, employees, or daily users, no one really can pin it down.  However it&#x27;s obvious that it has some unique properties in terms of how it lets celebrities get close to their fans, and how it allows a conversation to take place among influential people.  Twitter has the power to spread ideas faster and across more varied demographics than any other tech product.<p>But the question Wall Street keeps asking is how can Twitter grow 5x so it has the same number of users as Facebook.  They don&#x27;t give a shit if the average Twitter user is 100x as influential.  And it goes even deeper than that, because Twitter still faces this existential question of what it can become, whereas Facebook is pretty clear what it is, and the question is only how valuable their data is.  In other words, I believe Twitter has a lot more upside than Facebook, but of course it can&#x27;t take a risk on any of those ideas if it&#x27;s judged by Wall Street&#x27;s unimaginative criteria.",1441571622

Only the wealthy and upper-middle class filed returns—less than 10 percent of the population. The system was based on what the irs called “self-assessment,” which meant that the taxpayer told the government what he or she earned the prior year and then sent a check on March 15. Some information returns were sent to the government, but the government had no capacity to match the return to the taxpayer and the returns piled up in warehouses. Not until 1962 did the government’s computer system begin to efficiently match the information returns to the taxpayer. During the 1920s and 1930s, the tax system relied almost entirely on the honesty of taxpayers.</i><p>It&#x27;s amazing to think that there was once a time in US history when the government could sustain itself through the honesty and goodwill of the richest 10% of its citizens.<p>I wonder what would happen if we returned to the goodwill tax model. If we had a simple tax code with self-reported earnings where we spent far less on hunting down and punishing cheaters and freeloaders, and instead left it as a matter of conscience for those who had amassed their wealth and raised their families through the good grace and fortune of living in the US.<p>Do you think our collective social fabric would be strong enough to fund an effective government? Or are we too far down the path of the self-centered, get mine at all costs, cheat the system if possible mindset?",1441569694

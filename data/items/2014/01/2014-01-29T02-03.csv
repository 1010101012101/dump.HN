7141526,comment,7140898,7141337,10,0,ANTSANTS,,,"> err, can you link me to the other thread?<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7141039"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7141039</a><p>They just mentioned bitcoin mining and didn&#x27;t go into any detail.<p>> Does AMD GPU hardware have a general advantage mining?<p>Yes. Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t mine anything, am not <i>that</i> familiar with how Bitcoin works, and mostly heard about this stuff on the grapevine, so some of this is probably off. Corrections are welcome, if there are any cryptocurrency experts lurking.<p>At first, Bitcoin mining was done on CPUs. It uses SHA-256 for hashing, which (relatively speaking) isn&#x27;t that difficult to compute. At some point, someone developed a GPU implementation for it, after which GPU mining quickly overtook CPU mining in terms of cost efficiency. The problem is easily parallelizable (just run a separate hashing procedure on each of the many processing elements in the average GPU), making it a better fit for GPUs than CPUs.<p>The short reason[1] that AMD GPUs are better than NVidia GPUs for this purpose is that while NVidia&#x27;s GPUs use more powerful, but lesser in number processing elements, AMD GPUs use less powerful but more numerous processing elements (a processing element is basically marketing speak for each of the dozens or hundreds of small, specialized &quot;CPUs&quot; that make up a GPU). For mining Bitcoins, the extra capabilities of the NVidia processing elements basically go to waste, while AMD&#x27;s cards, with more, less power-consuming elements, give you both &quot;more hash for the dollar&quot; and &quot;more hash for the megawatt hour.&quot; This caused a huge spike in the value of ATI cards, completely unrelated to demand for PC gaming.<p>However, because this was a trivially parallelizable problem and there is big money at stake, miners came up with FPGA-based solutions (and later ASICs) dedicated to the purpose of mining Bitcoins, which in turn took the Bitcoin mining throne from GPUs. As I understand it, at this point mining Bitcoin with a GPU is a net-negative, and you need an ASIC farm to actually make anything off the operation.<p>At another point, Litecoin came around, and one of it&#x27;s design goals was to be only practical to mine on CPUs, so that Bitcoin miners could make use of the underutilized CPU in their PC-based mining setups. It used the scrypt algorithm in place of SHA-256 for this purpose, which was designed to be computationally expensive and difficult to practically implement on FPGAs or ASICs (and therefore, more resistant against brute-force password hashing attacks), in particular by requiring a lot more memory than it would make sense to allocate a hashing unit on dedicated hardware. Unexpectedly, someone came up with a performant GPU implementation for that as well, giving AMD GPUs back the throne for mining (of Litecoins, and the Litecoin-derived Dogecoin). At this point, there is no sign of a cost-effective FPGA or ASIC-based scrypt mining device, so it looks like things will remain that way for a while.<p>[1] The gory details here, including something I wasn&#x27;t aware of until now: NVidia GPUs lack an instruction for a certain operation necessary for SHA-2 hashing that costs them a couple of instructions each loop to emulate. AMD GPUs do have an instruction for it, so this automatically gave them another advantage over NVidia GPUs for mining purposes. Not sure if this applies to scrypt as well, but I&#x27;d guess so, since it was derived from SHA-2.<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_a_GPU_mines_faster_than_a_CPU#Why_are_AMD_GPUs_faster_than_Nvidia_GPUs.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Why_a_GPU_mines_faster_than_a_CPU...</a>",1390963952
7141525,comment,7140231,7140728,2,0,ttcbj,,,"I agree with the analysis above, with one addition: a big reason to pay yourself more at any owners only profitable small business is to max out a contribution to a &#x27;individual 401k&#x27;, sep-ira, or similar.  The rules vary, but if your &#x27;salary&#x27; is in the $250k ballpark, you can contribute up to $51k in additional money to a tax deferred retirement plan.  Just like a 401k, it grows tax free.<p>Most SS taxes are capped just above $100k, and if you own a tech company it&#x27;s pretty hard to argue you salary should be below that, so the SS angle is limited.

At the margin, you&#x27;ll work less if you get $100 in return for an hour&#x27;s labor than if you get $200 in return for it. Maybe still more than half as much work, but you&#x27;ll still decrease the amount of labor you perform. Income taxes do exactly that.<p>It&#x27;s possible to make the marginal disincentives less steep, but the more you do that, the more you lose the cost savings you were hunting for in the first place.<p>E.g. imagine a basic income of $20k. And suppose you make it phase out such that at $40k you don&#x27;t get one. That amounts to a whopping 50% marginal tax rate. And that tax rate is <i>on top of</i> existing taxes, and it&#x27;s not hard to end up with a result where someone making $30k/year is paying a 75% marginal tax rate. Which is much too high for anyone making so little.<p>So let&#x27;s try spreading it out. If it phases out at $60k, that&#x27;s a 33% marginal tax rate; $80k is 25%; $100k is 20%. That&#x27;s much better, though still a significant tax. But you&#x27;ve also made the guaranteed minimum income much closer in cost structure to a simple basic income. At least 90% of individuals make less than $100k, and their average per capita income is probably below $40k (remember we&#x27;re cutting out the long tail that accounts for a large percentage of income). So we&#x27;re paying out around $12k to each of them on average; and since we cut out the people making above $100k, that&#x27;s around $11k per person, 55% the direct financial cost of a basic income.<p>Cheaper, definitely, but you&#x27;re still going to face sticker shock. And you&#x27;ve paid for the cheapness in the disincentives due to taxes; administrative costs; and in creating incentives to misreport income.",1390963629

7141488,comment,7137498,7138716,1,0,jfroma,,,"The [OWASP] recommended approach to solve CSRF is with a Synchronizer Token [1].<p>Basically render a token with a hidden input with your form associated with the user session and as you mention use a middleware to validate the token on every request.<p>So, let&#x27;s talk about Syncronizer Token and &quot;Single Page Applications&quot; which was the topic on our first blog post. The recommended way for this is to get a token the first time and use the token in a header in every AJAX request. [2]<p>So, you now have cookies that are vulnerables to CSRF and a token in your javascript scope, in the same way you have the JWT.<p>If you think XSS is that common, the http only cookie+synchronizer token is more work and equally vulnerable to CSRF.<p>While with JWT you can stole my token if the site is XSS-vulnerable, but you can&#x27;t trick me with the browser to do things I didn&#x27;t meant.<p>I still consider XSS is easy to prevent than CSRF, you just need to escape user inputs always which is what every major template engine does by default.

As a result, it doesn&#x27;t matter who is nominally paying it - the &quot;real&quot; payer (the incidence of the tax) depends on the relative elasticity of the supply and demand.<p>As it turns out, empirically, about 95% of the incidence of FICA (if I remember correctly) falls on the employee. In other words, it doesn&#x27;t matter if the employer is nominally paying for half - they factored that in already when deciding how much to offer the employee when they hired him or her.<p>For many people reading this thread, Social Security is a bad deal no matter how you look at it - for many people reading this, it will be <i>literally</i> impossible to earn as much back from Social Security as they have paid in (assuming a vaguely realistic life expectancy).<p>(This is not a political statement, by the way - whether or not one believes that Social Security is good or bad depends on how much value one places on transferring a bit of wealth in order to guarantee a minimum income for the elderly.

7141351,comment,7135667,7136277,1,0,jwarkentin,,,"I think you&#x27;re thinking of the wrong problem. The basic problem, of course, is simply that we want an easy way to pay for things without having to carry a lot of cards around. Google Wallet was an attempt to solve that, but it&#x27;s got some flaws.<p>First off, everyone has a card reader, but not everyone accepts the NFC based payment method with Google Wallet from the phone. At the relatively few places that accept it, when I&#x27;ve tried it&#x27;s been pretty finicky and only worked a few times. So, naturally, I was pretty excited about the idea of a Google Wallet card when I first heard about that because it was a card I could actually swipe. It would be accepted everywhere and not be finicky.<p>Well, as it turns out that only pulls funds from your Wallet balance, not your selected default payment method. I told several people, even long before the Wallet card, that I really wanted a Google Wallet card that could charge any one of my payment methods, but that had a screen on it so I could select which one to use.<p>So like I said, it seems like an obvious solution. If you want to have a payment method that works everywhere (including legacy payment systems), isn&#x27;t finicky, and can replace all of your other cards then you obviously need a card with a barcode that has a screen and a way to select the payment method (or allows you to select the method on your phone before swiping - which is what I&#x27;d hoped the Wallet card would do since it&#x27;s a virtual card).<p>As for your accusation of protesting based on who is patenting, I really don&#x27;t give a crap. I&#x27;m opposed to most, if not all patents, but especially obvious ones like this because they stifle innovation. They&#x27;re used for evil SO much more than they&#x27;re used for good. As for Amazon specifically, I don&#x27;t really have any major problems with them. I generally like them. I just hope they don&#x27;t use this patent for evil because that would anger me enough to abandon them.",1390961246

7141347,comment,7124139,7137302,1,0,arg01,,,"Sorry this is quite long.<p>I&#x27;ll provisionally agree that enough people could buy into regulatory information assuming it&#x27;s useful enough. I&#x27;ll even allow that it&#x27;s not corrupted (though I have written a paragraph below on why I believe this wouldn&#x27;t be the case). I&#x27;ll allow that the regulators are able to discover who own the company above a protection firm all the way to the top. I&#x27;ll allow that people will actively switch between companies to stop a local monopoly forming (though I&#x27;ve written another paragraph below saying why this might not be true). Is there any way you can stop an investor buying up all the competition in a small region at a price above market value for a competitive market and below market value if you had a monopoly and were willing to abuse it?<p>Ignore the next two paragraphs if you want as they&#x27;re the ones referred to earlier:\nI don&#x27;t know that the regulators aren&#x27;t in bed with the regulated in the public system. I do know that if people care about it enough they can effect the regulators. I believe it&#x27;s easier for the regulators in a free market system to get in bed with the regulated because those most motivated in regulating a specific industry are those within the industry itself.<p>You may believe it&#x27;s obvious that consumers will switch to the better option in the market but the vast majority don&#x27;t because the majority of people can&#x27;t pay attention to everything they spend money on all the time. If you look up the “What&#x27;s my number” campaign in New Zealand you&#x27;ll see that simply reminding people they could change electricity providers and giving them an easy way to compare them hugely increased switch overs. The point being in this protection market which would be a service you just pay every other month would be something to easily forget about until it&#x27;s to late. Even given advertising by concerned parties how do I trust advertising anymore when there&#x27;s no one regulating it, I could put out an advert saying I&#x27;m the official spokesperson for a company and what would be the consequence?<p>My last paragraph was admittedly a quick example without explaining the reasoning behind it. I&#x27;ll explain my reasoning now. You say that protection and laws will be decided by what protection company you subscribe to. You obviously don&#x27;t have a system outside these providers to enforce other laws except market forces.<p>These providers can decide what services they offer. One of these services will obviously be protection from theft. i.e. If I stole from you your protection service will take action against me in some form.<p>What is the incentive for your provider to not offer varying plans that we find socially objectionable but say 5% of society is ok with. i.e. Plan A we imprison the perpetrator for these crimes. Plan B we cut off their hands for these crimes. Plan C (our platnium package) we shoot the guy for any crime against you. Plan D (our cheapest) we take the perpetrator to a work camp were he works off his debt to you. (Plan D is at a work camp were room and board costs more than what we pay the perpetrator). These providers also offer lower penalties i.e. no work camp penalty to those who are customers.<p>So obviously the next step is your provider comes up with a set of rules that limit what other providers can do to you without some form of retribution. What form of retribution is this? Is it a financial penalty? If so how do I stop a rich man from saying I&#x27;ll double the cost of the penalty just get rid of this man. If it&#x27;s physical retribution does that mean we accept people being beaten up in the street by the protection providers as part of our daily lives?<p>Let&#x27;s say one provider has imprisonment as a penalty, why would I pay more for a provider that offers the same service but there prison is nicer that the alternative provider. Unless say the providers have a reciprocal agreement were they place their own customers in their own prison, which of course means the rich get to live in a country club for the duration of their sentence and the poor get whatever they can afford.<p>Finally the fact that everyone can afford a provider. While I do not agree that everyone will be able to afford a provider and there won&#x27;t be any homeless who can&#x27;t be preyed on with impunity, or that there are no poor that can&#x27;t afford health insurance (sorry I meant protection) we&#x27;ll ignore that. Instead consider what happens if for the sake of argument I forget my payment one month or I&#x27;m outside of my protection services city/village. Am I suddenly no longer protected and subject to others whims? Are there roaming fees for protection? If it&#x27;s a sunday night and I need to drive to the other side of the country to get to my dieing mum am I able to be beaten up at any gas station along the way with no penalties for the offender, and possibly penalties for me if I fight back?<p>Assuming we surmount these regional justice issues and we also get a system were the providers effectively offer an equivalent and fair level of &#x27;justice&#x27; no matter who you subscribe with how do you stop one growing on the basis of being the most efficient and then leveraging economies of scale to get into a monopoly position. When the monopoly is established how do you expect a new upstart in the region to be able to get a reciprocal &#x27;justice&#x27; agreement with the monopoly when from a business point of view it is better to not have the competition.",1390961213

Dogs respond to rewards, not authority. To make a dog respond to your commands, he has to be trained to do so, using some kind of reward. Say ""sit"", he does the right thing, he gets a treat (or a hug, or to play, or whatever). Do this 50 times, and you have a dog that responds to the ""sit"" command.<p>No amount of gravitas in your voice is going to help him ""sit"" if he hasnt been trained.",1355068700

Excel export is one of them- there are not a lot of libraries that reliably read it in all cases, and it isn't even exported properly in many cases (so good luck fixing that).  Also changing formats like Apache Hadoop did allows things like sub-linear time (on the master node) file splitting- which is not possible if you are hunting arbitrarily far for matching quotes.  So superficially it may look like the opposite of opposing broken formats is ""recentism"", but there are often good reasons to start over with better trade-offs and better implementations.",1355067630

4894925,comment,4893755,4894734,2,0,Confusion,,,"Wittgenstein left some nicely quotable statements behind, that people think they understand, when in fact they don't. Like Nietzsche's ""God is dead""[1], there is a lot more behind the statement than most people know or even suspect. People repeat Wittgenstein's 'conclusion' from his Tractatus, but don't appreciate how much nuance his later publications give to that statement.<p>This is still the trap I was talking about. I'm not moving the goal posts: I'm just asserting that they are further away than most people think. Some people say: ""everyone is a philosopher"", to which you can reply ""indeed, and most are awful ones"".<p>Instead of asserting all kinds of things in this essay, pg should have asked a series of constructive questions: if something seems obvious, yet smart people disagree, then perhaps, just perhaps, there is something to learn there. Somewhere with deeper knowledge of the subject could then have pointed to material that explains why it just isn't so simple.<p>That is the bottom line: it just isn't so simple. It is unclear which things 'we cannot speak of', if anything. It is unclear how to make language precise enough to speak of certain things and whether that is possible. Many people have written many things about 'language and truth' and simply majoring in philosophy is just not enough to appreciate the whole of it, like majoring in physics is not enough to understand most Ph.D. theses in physics. It certainly doesn't enable one to conclude that ""philosophy is just confusion over language"". If only because there are branches of philosophy that investigate that exact question.<p>[1] This is the entire aphorism and the sentences that follow the proclamation of God's death are essential to understanding what Nietzsche is saying. Those who don't know what follows the proclamation don't understand <i>anything</i> about what Nietzsche was saying. First and foremost: he is not (just) talking about the Christian God.<p><pre><code>  God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. Yet\n  his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves,\n  the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and \n  mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to\n  death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?\n  What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What\n  festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to\n  invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for\n  us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear\n  worthy of it?</code></pre>",1355067051

Benchmarking is taking a measurements of a nondeterministic process, i.e. a statistical sample. Yes, some problem with the setup is quite likely given the result, but other explanations are possible as well. What if some threshhold for some action that helps the server deal with more concurrent connections was just not hit at 100 connections? unlikely but not imposible.",1355065741

On the other hand brain thrives on aerobic activity, esp. higher end of the spectrum near the aerobic threshold. And this is also great for your mood and general well being.<p>It also takes a decade to develop your aerobic engine (well there are really 3 - 4 metabolic systems available to you when you do aerobic exercise, but some are so short in duration that are negligible and the others respond to training very well). Developing power at threshold (i.e. put out as much power as you can at a level just at the edge between aerobic and anaerobic) is the slowest to develop.<p>For more on connection between brain health and aerobic exercise see Dr. Medina's Google talk on his ""Brain Rules"".

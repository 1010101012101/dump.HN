What it does is present an incredibly more fluid feel with the way the tabs gently slide out at the edge of your vision, and the fonts seem to be more carefully rendered.<p>Also, when you see the web pages in Chrome you see them with all the ads intact. The pages are designed for ads so they have a more aesthetic impact with a greater variety of detail, color and incident.<p>(On the other hand, it has loaded the page ads and all as fast as Firefox with ads blocked.)<p>Overall it seems to me that 70-75% of the sense of Chrome being better is subliminal, the effect of a better aesthetic impression.",1238896794

Long letters were always very rare; a prolific letter-writer in the 1800s might have written hundreds of them in a lifetime, but a more typical number might be ten.  I think the majority of human discourse throughout the millennia has consisted of things like schoolgirl gossip, parents scolding their children, ""ain't-it-awful"" discussions in bars, and requests for phone numbers shouted over loud music in dance clubs.  What you're observing is that more of that stuff is being done in writing instead of by voice.<p>People do seem to be more willing to disagree with each other on the internet, but that doesn't necessarily worsen the quality of the discourse.",1238895790

546923,comment,546743,546856,0,0,kragen,,,"Python is slow.  For loops containing arithmetic, array indexing, function calls, and similar primitive operations that also exist in C, it's maybe 100× slower than C.  But programs written in Python are usually not 100× slower than C programs with similar functionality.  They may be 10× slower or 3× slower or, very rarely, faster; that's because their inner loops tend to be in operations like regexp matching, array arithmetic, data compression, string hashing, and the like, and Python's implementations of those things aren't themselves written in Python — they're the things you're likening to ""gzip"" here.<p>There's a selection bias here.  If you write your compiler or interpreter or pathfinding algorithm in Python, it's going to be a lot more than 10× slower than if you wrote it in C (or Java or OCaml or whatever).  So people don't write those programs in Python, so we don't get to compare them.<p>I've been writing about Python because I know more about it than I do about Ruby, but I think most of the same things are true of Ruby, as well.",1238895407

546914,comment,546743,546852,0,0,ewjordan,,,"I agree with you, but I think the gp has a point: look at Java as an example.  Here we are, at a point where Java code runs extremely fast, but because of the ""Java is slow"" meme that took off at the turn of the century, any time Java comes up you _still_ see uninformed people on (for instance) Slashdot insisting that Java is unusable for important code because it's so slow.<p>That said, I don't think the right solution to avoiding problems like this is a ""head in the sand"" approach.  If there are real performance issues, they should be acknowledged and addressed.  I definitely get the sense that a lot of Ruby zealots are trying to pretend that there is no problem, which is something that Java zealots tried to do years ago (and something that the people in control of feature requests still do quite a bit, using the ""Nobody can microbenchmark the JVM, it's too smart!"" excuse).<p>I don't know why this stuff gets people so emotional, though.

546901,comment,546799,546799,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I think hackers need to hack a new social response to mass shooting incidents. Currently there is saturation news coverage of such incidents, and much speculation of what ""drove"" the shooter to kill many people, often just before the shooter kills himself. Maybe video game designers need to build in scenes in the games where a mass murderer has survivors desecrate his grave and curse him as a cowardly loser, rather than seeming to glorify mass violence. Maybe news media coverage of such incidents needs to be more subdued. (I've read that news outlets are encouraged NOT to report suicide clusters, to avoid triggering copy-cat clusters of suicides in other places.) Lots of people own guns and never use them in any harmful way, and a sufficiently crazy person can use a car or a common household chemical to kill multiple people. There needs to be a social consensus that (this will sound very harsh) the murder-suicide perpetrator should just eliminate the middleman and kill himself without harming innocent bystanders. The more mass murder can be held up to shame and disgust rather than amazement, the better.",1238894403

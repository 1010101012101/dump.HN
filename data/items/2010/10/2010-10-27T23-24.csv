1840948,comment,1839611,1840082,0,0,alextp,,,"Re ""Could you provide easy examples where you would use a pair-wise approach, and a list-wise approach? Like, let's say I wanted to build a recommendation system for college football pick-ems (Ie, will Iowa beat Michigan State? Etc.). Which method would be preferred, and why?""<p>I had written a longer reply detailing what are listwise methods and how they differ from pairwise methods, but apparently it was eaten by the web hyenas.<p>Turian's explanation doesn't actually cover what listwise methods are. I've seen them presented in the learning to rank context (learning to rank is when you want to build a machine learning system that given a set of documents, say search results, ranks them from more to less relevant to a query), so I'll follow this context here.<p>There are two very obvious approach to design a learning system that outputs sorted data: the first is to learn to assign a real number to each ""document"" (and then you sort according to these numbers) and the second is to learn a classifier that predicts given a pair of ""documents"" if a <= b (and then you can use this classifier as a comparison function in a sorting algorithm). Both these approaches have a common flaw, however, which is that they are very easily myopic, and will make decisions only looking at a very small window. This is clearly suboptimal in the learning to rank context because, for example, mistakes in the top elements of the ranked list are a lot more important than mistakes further down the list, and sometimes you want to maximize diversity or something like that, and it's hard to do that in an elementwise or pairwise approach.<p>So they invented listwise approaches, and there are actually two sorts of these: you can either learn a classifier that scores entire sorted sequences of documents (with features like document trigrams, features connecting similar documents, etc) or you can learn one of the above models with a loss function that depends on the entire sorted list of documents.<p>So essentially a listwise approach is better if you can do it, as listwise approaches come closer to minimizing error measures you actually care about (like precision among the top 10 documents) instead of bogus measures (like number of document pairs misclassified). On the other hand, precisely because listwise approaches allow you to be more specific, they are less generic, and it might be cumbersome to adapt one of them to your recommendation system.<p>Also, it fundamentally depends on how the results of your recommendation system are used. If you present something like top k recommendations then listwise approaches can be better, but in some other scenarios you will actually care about all the individual decisions, so a pairwise approach can do just as well.",1288222454

And if not, I'll probably be helping HN continue to develop this idea further through <i>action</i>.<p>I think I can safely assume the majority of active members representative of YC here have startups that are in need of traction, but of a different kind not yet fully explored; but nevertheless, in need of <i>resources</i>. I hope I'm also not mistaken in the feeling most of us feel ""not ready"" or not in the right stage for official seed funding and don't necessarily fit into traditional crowd funding landscape, or simply don't want that much of a burden to worry about while developing.<p>Yes, money is a burden because it's an anchor you must tie yourself to in most cases, and is hard to come by. I've read it many times here before, as it should be, since this is the YC news.

To where?

It doesn't have to be big; maybe some food, a sheltered corner to hack under, language manuals, maybe some light consulting, or other things of this nature. And like other crowd funding platforms, you make sure there are enough hands to help you down the edge so you don't have to <i>take the dive</i> by yourself. <i>In return</i>, the angels may receive the startup's product if it was something they personally wanted, or maybe simply the joy of having helped a hacker or two that is adding more value to the world than he or she is taking out, or maybe it's a kind of symbiosis not easily definable.<p>In short, I feel I'm not alone when I say this has much more potential than just being slash or pipe ""Offer"", and being so, it really is out of place in the header. HN community participation shouldn't be a function narrowed in scope by its site header, nor should the header sacrifice its functionality of directing users contributing and reading news.

While my transition from physical products to digital has encountered a few difficulties the information here has been invaluable. With experience designing, prototyping, and manufacturing physical products I wanted to provide a guide for people that are going in the opposite direction. Saw a few questions on the subject so hereâ€™s a summary of what I use.<p>Best Cheap Design Package: Ailbre Design (as low as $50)
http://www.alibre.com/
I used this before Solidworks, if the design isnâ€™t extremely complicated this is the software to use. Make sure to find a coupon, they offer 50% off about every other month. There are 3 different price points depending on what you are doing. Very active community that helps newcomers learn.<p>Enclosure Prototyping in the US: 
http://www.protomold.com/ or http://www.quickparts.com/
I tend to use Quickparts more, but Protomold is also very good. All you do is upload the design and they price it. Also Quickparts offers samples that show you different finishes, materials, and designs problems to avoid. If new, definitely order one.<p>Design Guidelines:
http://www.protomold.com/Resources.aspx
Shows you the general rules on materials and design.<p>Outsourcing Design Work:
http://elance.com/ or http://guru.com/
Excellent locations to find extra help, only accept companies after you have talked to them (I suggest IM for overseas) and only if they have sample projects and references within the US. Place a keyword at the end which they must reference in the bid so you know they read your requirements.<p>Electronics Prototyping in US:
This really depends on the type of parts, the mount, and quantity. Generally though I use http://www.screamingcircuits.com/. For just a couple there are a few cheaper options.<p>Electronics Layout:
http://www.cadsoftusa.com/index.htm
Itâ€™s cheap and gets the job done for simple projects. They have a free version to test.<p>Parts Supplier:
Small scale: http://digikey.com/
Large scale: http://arrownac.com/
If you get in touch with a sale or tech rep at Arrow they can be a great help in putting you in touch with oversea producers. Arrowâ€™s website sucks so just find your local rep and call them.<p>Producing in China:
There arenâ€™t really any go to firms, it depends on what you are building. For rapid injection and electronic assembly I have used http://icomold.com, they even do design and prototyping. The design work is done in the US while the manufacturing is completed in China. They sell steel injection molds for the same price as a lower quality aluminum mold in the US.<p>The general rule when producing in China is to NEVER have a product completely assembled in 1 factory unless you want copies going out the back door.<p>How to do it:
1)	Have the device produced in 1-2 locations without the software
2)	Have the boxes produced
3)	Ship the unboxed products to the US, (LA)
4)	Hire a firm to box the product and flash the hardware<p>If there are more questions I would be happy to try and answer them.",1288221611

They are mashing together frameworks.<p>I've looked into frameworks like Django.  It's not good because it abstracts away the functionality of the database.  It's nice that everything is an object, but if you want to do something more complex and go around the framework, things get messy and start to feel hackish.<p>I am a PHP developer and I generally don't use a PHP framework.  I have my own set of classes that I wrote (and improve on).  I have also used the smarty template engine in the past, which works really well for keeping HTML separated from the actual code (and it has built-in caching).  Jquery is also great for the front-end.<p>I started development with pascal, then moved to c/c++, and finally PHP.  I like PHP because it is a high-level enough language that makes development easy, yet it's still powerful enough to allow for complexity and lower-level functionality.  The c-style syntax doesn't hurt either.<p>PHP 4 and below had many security issues (what were they thinking with register_globals?), but 5.1+ has made some major changes.",1288221205

The food costs (flour, yeast, ingredients) and packaging costs = Cost of Goods Sold.<p>But then restaurants have a whole host of other costs which might be somewhat fixed.<p>Interest expense, Restaurant Wages, Rent, Restaurant Operating Expenses (utilities, maintenance of the building, repairs), General/Administrative (corporate level costs), Advertising/Marketing expenses.<p>So the key is to figure out what is going wrong. If you have a bakery housed in a location where the rent is just really high, you'll either need to raise prices on bread (could hurt volume), increase volume, or reduce rent.<p>If the interest expense is the issue then you need to either restructure the loan or pay the loan off asap.<p>If they are not profitable, they will want to determine how to become profitable. That's either going to come from increasing volume, increasing prices, or reducing costs. But any of those strategies could have their own drawbacks. Price hikes can reduce volume.<p>If you switch to inferior ingredients you might reduce volume if it alters taste. If you increase volume you will be baking more bread which will require more by way of labor.<p>They need to first establish what their problem is, then they can analyze potential solutions.",1288220859

Are you capping the number of start-ups you are working with?  (This offer doesn't seem to be infinitely scalable.)<p>2) Do you see this role more as employee-working-for-stock or as angel-investor-contributing-design-skills-instead-of-money?  Maybe another way of asking that is: are you taking direction from the founders/owners or are you offering advice/support as you see fit?  Are you OK with a founder who only wants you slice up a PSD she designed or are you looking for an adviser role?<p>3) I think there is a lot of sense in pg's advice around giving up a small percentage of the company in exchange for a much greater chance of success, but I'm not sure it is obvious that your offer is a ""great deal"" for the founders as you state.<p>I'll accept that in some cases a good design can increase the value/success of a company by 10% or more but I think in this specific scenario (early stage start-up, possibly with long-hanging fruit design challenges):<p>a) A 10% improvement in the <i>current</i> value of the company probably isn't worth 3% of the <i>eventual</i> value of the company if it is successful. That is, it may be easy to take a company from $1000/mo to $1100/mo through 5-10 hours of design, but barring major oversight I think it will be a lot more difficult to take a company from $10M to $11M through graphic/web design alone.<p>b) On the founder side of the equation whether or not the design work will increase the value of the company more than it cost is really only half of the question. The other half is comparison shopping: is there a cheaper way to do this?<p>For instance, if you assume a modest $500,000 exit then 3-5% is $15,000 to $35,000, which may be a roughly competitive rate for design services (e.g., that's $60 to $100/hr if you assume 50 5 hour weeks).  Obviously if you assume a $1M exit those rates double. If you assume a $5M exit those rates grow by an order of magnitude, and I hope I'm not a cheapskate in thinking that $600 to $1000/hr is a disproportionately high rate for all but the most remarkable web designers and even then is probably only appropriate for the most design sensitive web apps (whichever those are).<p>I may well be wrong, but I have a hard time believing that for most start-ups a bit of early stage design work really provides an additional 6-7 figures of valuation in the long run.  Is that what are saying is ""ridiculously easy""?<p>c) A moderately successful start up should be able to afford market rates for design services, and I'd guess that it is rare for great rather than merely acceptable design to be the difference between moderate success and failure. Why shouldn't a firm just limp along with an acceptable design until they can afford a great one? (And if they don't have an acceptable design yet they can certainly get one for less than 3% of the company.)<p>In other words, I think the major challenge to your offer isn't about whether or not design can offer a 10% improvement but more about whether or not 3% of the company is the easiest/cheapest/lowest risk way to get that improvement.",1288220654

There's also no help section or features section, which left me guessing on how to use product and what problem it would solve for me.<p>Minor UI issue I noticed, in Chrome, the background images on the signup page show a light grey background instead of the darker page background.<p>If you can fix the audio issue, I'll take another shot at reviewing.",1288220553

I'm just suggesting however that it gets added to the top nav bar of the site to encourage people to continue posting these items in an ongoing way (although hopefully at a more reasonable frequency than today).

From what I can tell the 1 night thing was to fix a bug, not improve performance.<p>Regarding the 5x increase:<p>> One of our operations engineers, Ricardo Chimal, Jr., has been working for some time on improving the way we target messages between components of our platform.

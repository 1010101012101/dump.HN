It stored natural numbers. Each sample contained a few gigs of natural numbers. Numbers could be anywhere form 0 to 99999. <i>So each entry contained all possible numbers in increments of 0.02, with Null in all places where the sample did not contain that number.</i><p>This is what happens when people have never heard of foreign keys or a one-to-many relationship or a many-to-many relationship.<p>This could have been done so it's a lot smaller and faster to search. The place holder could have been a negative int, instead of Null, so that it would evaluate to something other then Null in searches. An infinity of things could have been done better.<p>But when you have Ph.D and you legitimately think of yourself as brilliant. AND you are used to doing a lot of HARD work, then heroics with MS Access just seem natural, right, that's what hard science is damn it. And this is why a little knowledge can be worse then no knowledge.<p>If that guy had instead hired almost anyone else to design the database, he would have been better off. It's hard to imagine anyone who could have screwed up worse AND had the tenacity to stick with it.<p>PhDs are not just smart, but they also are used to working hard so when things get hard they don't quickly perceive that as signal to try something else.<p>As to being computer illiterate:<p>A field biologists might get away with it, but anyone working in a lab will sooner or later measure something with an instrument entirely controlled by and accessed though a computer.<p>Let me say that again, a computer is the gate keeper.<p>And it's not enough to simply know how to use the GUI/API what ever. You have to also know at least something about the algorithms involved in the analysis. <i>Because a lot of analysis of things that can't be seen with the naked eye is actually statistical inference of what's there.</i><p>Let me say that again, a whole of of stuff is not measured in the way a lay person thinks of measuring, <i>it is inferred using fancy math</i>.<p>But make your math a bit too fancy and you're just making stuff up now. Use a second order polynomial and you're good, use a 3rd or higher order and you can see anything you want. There's a reason we use cubic b splines for computer graphics, it's because we can fit them to any shape we want!<p>And oh yeah I've seen 3rd order polynomials used in science, no they were not used correctly.",1249058323

734740,comment,734373,734565,0,0,imack,,,"When I was job searching right out of university, one of the reasons I stopped looking at big job boards is that they tended to be filled with jobs from recruiting agencies that wouldn't name the client and would instead show themselves as the employer.  I hated that because the type of company was so important to me and what recruiting agency wasn't going to say their client had a position at a ""dynamic successful company"" where you'd work on ""cutting edge technology"".  They say potential employers spend 30 seconds looking at resumes; I always joked that potential employees spend even less time looking at job postings.  If I couldn't figure out what kind of company it was, why would I waste time writing a cover letter?<p>Although, now that I'm on the other side, I can see why I don't like traditional job listings either.  If I post a developer job (at this startup) on something too public I get spammed with mediocre applicants.  It takes a long time to sort through them all, and that's time I could be programming.<p>I do believe this is a problem in need of a decent solution, but I agree that it spreading virally doesn't really differentiate it from traditional means.",1249057938

Other classes that my degree required was advanced mathematics (with biological application), advanced statistics, and computer science.<p>About the computer science portion of my degree: I was required to learn C, C++, discrete math, Perl, and data structure/algorithm design. I chose to take machine language as an elective.<p>What I've learned in industry: The CS foundation I built in college was critical. Although Perl is widely used where I work, languages like R and C are used more often (for my particular projects). I've also learned that my job is to bridge the gap between biologists and computer scientists.<p>Biologists say what they want to get-> Statisticians/Mathematicians think up a procedure -> I make sure the formulas make sense with the subject at hand, program it in Perl or whatever -> CS people optimize it and do their magic to make it run super fast -> checked by everyone to make sure its okay. -> stats analyze and feedback to the biologists.<p>My point being, I always think everyone should learn more math, but the industry has found a way to get around everyone needing to learn everything (jack of all trades master of none) to having experts work together towards a common goal (an oceans 11 type set-up). Everyone has something special to offer. Personally, I think the current set-up is working fine. Although everyone should learn more advanced math (or biologists should learn more CS), not everyone is willing and/or capable.<p>I hope this was helpful.",1249057460

I have a friend (neighbor actually) who has degrees in geology, but is clearly a top notch developer.  He runs a very successful small software shop (doing custom development for small to medium businesses, usually on the Microsoft stack) - when you mentioned the 90% social, ""pin down what should be done"" angle, I immediately thought of what this guy does.  His customers could care less that he doesn't have a CS degree.<p>What he does that really sets him apart (in my view) is that he sits down with the people who are doing the work in these small to medium size businesses and then designs the tools that he feels would make him most productive if he had to do the job of that person.<p>BTW, I have a MS in CS and spend my days hacking SQL.  I really enjoyed getting both my BS and MS in comp sci.  Having them was pretty key in kick-starting my career.  I started at a huge IT company and the degrees mattered there.

Creating a good environment where kids enjoyed coming to school was obviously a priority at the top of the organization.<p>2. In addition to all of the classic recess games like kickball and four square, the school put out some chess sets and got toys for the sandbox so that kids had alternatives.  There was a playground rule, “can’t say can’t play” that instilled the notion that games were open to everyone.<p>3.

Adults use violence too. Violence is alive and well in most blue collar male dominated jobs. The act of not being an easy target is specifically addressed by fighting back. You can't project an image of ""If you screw with me, I'll make life difficult for you"" as an adult if you aren't taught this as a child. This has a huge value every damn day you are not mugged, picked for a car-jacking, or otherwise selected by those people looking for easy targets.<p>(c) Physical violence is a subset of bullying in pretty much every standard definition. The reason for this is that males tend to solve their issues through force, while females tend to use other methods. If you separate only the male response as something worth addressing, I think you are missing the underlying nature of bullying.<p>(d) If you punch me, even now as an adult, you're getting your ass kicked; or I'm going to at least hurt you as bad as I can. That being said I don't think I've been punched since I left the army 13 years ago (And before then, probably once or twice in high school). I'd like to think that's because most people - even those inclined to resort to violence - can instinctively tell that would be a bad idea, or at the very least, a difficult task.<p>As an aside a story:<p>In 2001, I moved to Vancouver, BC. I was about 26 at the time. As I lived next to the beach, I decided one night to go for a stroll. It must have been about 11-12PM or so. The path by the beach was dark and away from the street down a hill, and at this time of night, almost devoid of people. I liked the water though and being new to the city felt relatively safe. As I was walking, I approached two men (probably late teens early 20's on a bench). One had a bike and one was on foot. As I got closer, they both said nothing to each other. The one on the bike started to ride on the path towards me. At this point I could see they were the stereotypical young b-boy punks. The guy on the bike got closer, slowly. I looked him straight in the eye as he passed and heard him circle around behind me.<p>I kept on walking, same speed and gait. As I passed the guy on the bench, I looked him straight in the eye as well. You could feel the tension, but I pretended I didn't and just kept walking. The guy on the bike stopped at the bench, now behind me and that was the end of it.<p>I'm convinced that those two goofs were up to no good. They concluded however, that I wasn't worth their time.<p>Take it for what it is, but don't ever think for a second that you aren't part of the jungle of primal human behaviour that is very much alive and well.",1244571297

For all we know, in a thousand years, the laws of physics will completely change, with absolutely no clue given in advance. And I don't mean different vacuum states or anything like that, I mean, <i>completely</i> different physics. We can't prove it won't happen, only be Bayesian-very-sure it won't, which isn't the same.<p>However, nothing <i>necessarily</i> stops us from determining the laws of physics all the way to the bottom. There's no contradiction there, only a question of whether they are ""too far"" away for us to see them or we are unable to gather enough information, not because it is fundamentally impossible to figure out the substrate you are running on but simply because the substrate itself happens to be too fuzzy to tell. Already, we're to the point where if you built a universe off of the standard model and added some hacks to cover the cases where we know it doesn't work, you could probably build a correct-enough simulation to support life.<p>(Also, rather than posting again: I strongly disagree with the author's claim that the real world is more complex than math.

If you admit &quot;bad data&quot; into your language, you very quickly spiral into true undefined behavior.<p>Well, by your definition, it would indeed be basically impossible to turn C into a well-defined language. You&#x27;d have to make absolutely radical changes to memory management, pointers, etc.<p>So then, can we at least agree that it would be a good idea to <i>minimize</i> undefined behavior in C? Sure, we can&#x27;t fix bad pointer accesses, and I get why this stuff was there in the &#x27;70s. But modern CPUs have largely homogenized on some basic attributes. How about we decide that &quot;two&#x27;s complement has won&quot; and thus clearly define what happens on signed integer overflow? How about we state that &quot;a byte is 8-bits&quot;? And so on ... all of the things that are true of basically every major CPU in use, and that would be <i>exceedingly</i> unlikely to ever change again in the future.<p>And this can still be offered as an optional flag. But when enabled, it&#x27;s just a little bit of added protection against an oversight turning into a major security vulnerability, and at virtually no cost.",1436935831

The most that can happen afaik is getting fired, which is scary enough.<p>In the end what I got from the article is that the initial vision of EA largely succeeded: to replicate the music industry and Hollywood with a steady big budget revenue stream. The only problem is the glaring misnomer: the correct term would be the unsavory &#x27;Electronic Mass Media&#x27; instead of &#x27;Electronic Arts&#x27;.<p>The sad fact about the shareholder revenue maximization in this industry is that people are happy to be fed dog food, and producers are happy to make tons of money off of it. They  shrug off the moral dilemma and say &quot;we&#x27;re just making what people want!&quot;. This situation is reproduced verbatim across mass media -- the largest revenue share is absorbed by content that is simply not good at all. If you look at music, I would say at least 80% of the top revenue generators out there produce music that is objectively worse than centuries old music. Take this for example: [1], how can one not say it is altogether a better, more energetic, more expressive, more moving piece of art than the vast majority of what is produced? Yet people seldom listen to it. Who makes money off of copyright-free Mozart works? Of course, there are exceptions, but the situation overall is an unhappy conjunction of the vast majority of people being satisfied with repetitive industrialized hits, lame jokes with explosions, and the sports game or first person shooter of the year -- while the industry is satisfied with flooding the market and the media with this rehash-able mass produced content. With no good consumer content discovery and reviewing tools, I believe that&#x27;s a stable status quo for the majority of the population.<p>That&#x27;s the role platforms like Steam with indie games (or Spotify with indie music, or Netflix with original productions) can perform: the consumers can seek directly quality, and marketers don&#x27;t have the ability to distort this too much. With good discovery consumers should be able seek more engrossing experiences and share opinions directly, hopefully without bias towards what&#x27;s brand new (although I confess that one is hard to get rid of). In this kind of marketplace producers can also target more specific markets, making what they enjoy and find beautiful (and still able to make good revenue off that niche) instead of aiming for generic mass market titles.<p>Of course, it could simply be that a large fraction of the population irremediably wants to just shut off their brains  outside their jobs, but I don&#x27;t want to believe that, at least not without unmistakable evidence.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISBNqJZVrXM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISBNqJZVrXM</a>",1436934587

But the differences are minor.<p>But, to be precise, libsodium prefers XSalsa20 to ChaCha20. The core feature about XSalsa20 is that it supports a 192-bit nonce instead of the 64-bit nonce of ChaCha20. This means that it is safe to use a randomly generated nonce, while randomly generating a 64-bit nonce would result in collisions eventually. I believe this is the reason they chose XSalsa20.<p>XSalsa20 is a simple variation on Salsa20 that does a bit more initialization to turn the normal 64-bit nonce into 192-bit. I assume the same construction can be applied to ChaCha20, but since djb (the author of both Salsa, XSalsa and ChaCha) hasn&#x27;t done it, I think that libsodium went with the safe approach and just used XSalsa20.",1436933875

How the value is interpreted determines is left to the implementor. If the value is interpreted as a tuple and has a predetermined form, then you can get to a relational (or SQL) database. If the value is interpreted as a pointer you can get to  a graph database. If the value is interpreted as a document you get some other sort of database.<p>If you&#x27;re really interested in databases, <i>Database Systems: the Complete Book</i> is an introductory text that I enjoyed last year.

678018,comment,677725,677962,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The very energetic high-energy particles are less of a problem.  They tend to pass straight through and cause relatively little damage.  The critical danger comes from cascades of low energy secondary particles causing much greater damage to genes.<p>The people pushing for more sophisticated radiation shielding than tanks of water are hoping to get funded to build that stuff.  It's unnecessary.<p>Again, the lethality rate for Mars transit is about the same as picking up a bad smoking habit.  Acceptable for early explorers and initial colonists, and actually an argument for settling Mars as soon as possible.  (Many people already know these risks, and they <i>still</i> want to go!  Once you have a native workforce living up there with a local infrastructure, the risks are minimized because the resources for shielding form radiation are also more available.)<p><i>We are not going to mars anytime soon. Even a colony on the moon is not possible right now. We would either need to send people on once only short term construction trips, or some sort of robotic construction to make a shield first. Or a biological protectant of some kind.</i><p>Again nonsense.  You can build bricks and masonry arches out of local Martian materials.  Ship a ""vault-laying"" robot up there, and you can create lots of living space quickly.  Bury it in soil, and you get the physical support to pressurize those environments as well as radiation shielding.<p>(You can't do the same trick on the Moon, because you need lots of <i>water</i> to make bricks.  Far less of it on the Moon, and easily extracted concentrations of it are probably only at the poles.  To build weight-pressurized compressive structures on the Moon, you're going to have to make silica blocks.  A lot more energy intensive and expensive, with high temperature handling of materials.  Smelting aluminum?  Fuggedaboudit!)<p>Also, the radiation question is actually an argument for Mars over the Moon.  Mars has an atmosphere that reduces the radiation load of humans walking outside.  In fact, this is another reason why lunar industry should be established <i>from Mars</i> with teleoperated robots controlled form Earth.",1246218945

What is the rationale here: the Chinese seize the resources on Earth, so the USA goes to outer space to seize the resources of the Solar System?</i><p>Sorry, but you're not quite there yet.  The old world hadn't run out of resources when the American Industrial Revolution hit full stride.  A big part of the reason why the US rocked the world economically was because of advantageous economic geography.  (No need to devote resources to defend borders, lots of ports with easy access to waterways, waterways with good access to vast agricultural resources, advantageously situated synergistic natural resources like iron and coal, etc.)<p>If you look at the economic ""geography"" of the Solar System, it's quite obvious that Mars will eventually be the next North America.  It's much cheaper to get almost anywhere in the Solar System from Mars than Earth.  Heck, it even takes less energy to get to Earth's Moon from Mars than Earth.  (This makes it likely that initially lunar industrial equipment will be made on Mars, shipped to the Moon, and teleoperated from Earth's surface.)<p>Also note that you are making the classic mistake of not extrapolating technology.  Perhaps certain English shipwrights pooh-poohed the vast American forests.  After all, the infrastructure was all in Europe.  How many of them could have predicted that ships would be made of steel, sails would be obsolete, and ships would be propelled by coal and steam?  Industrial technology in the late 21st century is likely to even more unpredictable to us as our industry was unimaginable to all but a few denizens of 1909.  The only sure thing is that they will want to be able to marshall vaster resources and energies.  To do that, you must go to space.<p><i>I understand the allure of colonizing Mars. But I also believe in prioritizing. The US is fighting two unwinnable wars, and is in a grim financial situation.</i><p>Yes, but whatever we do, we need to do it <i>first.</i>  It will be much better for the US if the future superpower of Mars is not settled by the Chinese.<p><i>Why not start small? We could keep sending robots to Mars. Since Mars has ice and CO2, one could introduce plants in Mars and try to start recycling all that CO2 into oxygen. That would perhaps create a tiny habitat and make things easier for the first humans to ever land on the red planet.</i><p>Have you read Zubrin?  He thinks along similar lines.  However, he's probably spent a lot more time working out the difficulties, likely steps, even specific chemical processes.",1246218085

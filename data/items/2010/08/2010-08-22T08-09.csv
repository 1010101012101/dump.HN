1624404,comment,1624338,1624338,0,0,holman,,,"The thing that's just so frustrating about this is that this is <i>our</i> culture. Jazz (and its precursors) formed the foundations of pop, of rock, of rap. It's easy to think of culture as abstract concepts like our ""freedom"" or ""ambition"", but in the last century we've broadened our culture to be, in part, rooted in commercial entities. It's not bad, it's not good, it just is. The unfortunate effect though, as demonstrated by this find, is that we've permitted that part of our heritage to be legally locked away from us.",1282466916

1624400,comment,1623129,1623431,0,0,w00pla,,,"> I knew it was big, but a third of the British workforce? That's insane.<p>The British East India Company is nothing against the Dutch East India company. From WP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company</a>)<p>> was a chartered company established in 1602<p>> It was the first multinational corporation in the world and the first company to issue stock.[1]  It was also arguably the world's first megacorporation, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, negotiate treaties, coin money, and establish colonies<p>> Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asia trade. Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English (later British) East India Company, the VOCâ€™s nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 1600s.<p>> The Dutch East India Company remained an important trading concern for almost two centuries, paying an 18% annual dividend  for almost 200 years.",1282466317

You claim for weeks that you fear being the target of a smear campaign.<p>How better to protect yourself from one, than to vaccinate the entire public? Find two accolytes to report the alleged rape and molestation on just barely credible terms, and then either have them withdraw them or bring to light certain facts that mean that the charges HAVE to be dropped (factual inconsistencies, for example, or a previous record of crying wolf; etc).<p>Do this quickly on a saturday morning when newsrooms are too understaffed to do much reporting and will probably not have much time between the issuing of the charges and the withdrawal to actually spread the uncorrected, daaging rumours; just the retraction.<p>Result? CNN runs a front page headline next to not-negative press about you (charges withdrawn) suggesting to all its viewers that you might well be the target of a smear campaign. Future journalists AND readers will be immunised and healthily sceptical the next time something like this is attempted.<p>If this was a wikileaks taskforce's test balloon, wouldn't they have done it in a normal newsday?",1282465879

Don't put words in my mouth.<p>It's axiomatic that low-probability events must occur, given a long enough outlook.  What's <i>not</i> axiomatic are the broad, overwrought conclusions that Taleb reaches from this starting place.

10144164,comment,10139224,10143212,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"&quot; If you&#x27;re interested, I recently touched on the early history and original motivation in this blog post&quot;<p>Appreciate the write-up. Actually a good read. I did see a convergence between you and Dresden in this:<p>&quot; the external dependencies on top of which rump kernels run were discovered to consist of a thread implementation, a memory allocator, and access to whatever I/O backends the drivers need to access&quot;<p>Their papers from 2006-2010 on pushing stuff into user-mode for L4 kernels kept mentioning the same three things albeit with work. Shows that other academics trying to improve status quo in kernel-user mode tech should continue to work on making those things easier to understand, modify, debug, integrate, and so on. They keep popping up as critical to unrelated projects [for obvious reasons but still].<p>&quot; Since this is the Xen blog, we should unconventionally understand ASIC to stand for Application Specific Integrated Cloud.&quot;<p>I <i>really</i> wish the community didn&#x27;t re-invent ASIC&#x27;s definition. ASC would&#x27;ve done nicely. This is going to screw up search results for people researching either and filtering via titles/abstracts. I know because one threw me off for around 5-10 minutes because I skipped the abstract assuming it meant a chip and was <i>very confused</i> with their findings lol. &quot;How the hell did they implement Rump Kernels on an ASIC? Where&#x27;s the chip boundary in this diagram? Are these PCI devices in x86 servers?&quot; It will get worse in near future as much cutting-edge cloud stuff is on FPGA&#x27;s or leverage ASIC&#x27;s. I know: I gotta live with it. Just annoying as hell...<p>&quot; the ability to run unmodified POSIX-y software on top of the Xen hypervisor via the precursor of the Rumprun unikernel was born. &quot;<p>Speaks to what a good job you did on your end. Back to the HN conversation, though.<p>&quot;all that without fully understanding the related work. So you tend to make goal-driven assumptions, and hence &quot;related work&quot; generally tends to be more wrong than right. &quot;<p>Interesting. I&#x27;ll try to keep that in mind when reading seemingly bad ones in the future.<p>&quot;btw, my papers are somewhat obsolete, the dissertation is still mostly accurate&quot;<p>I was going to read... thoroughly skim... the dissertation anyway. Thanks for the tip, though, cuz I could&#x27;ve gotten lazy and read the paper instead. ;) I&#x27;ll just use dissertation and web site when I get around to trying to learn this stuff.<p>&quot;I never saw the LeVasseur paper as being in the same category as e.g. DDE. &quot;<p>The connection is that the paper tried to reuse, unmodified drivers with new OS&#x27;s and clients (eg stand-alone apps). Implied one could even use several OS&#x27;s if one supported hardware X and the other hardware Y. That&#x27;s what DDE did, albeit differently,  along with what people told me you did with again different implementation strategy. That&#x27;s the only connection. I mean, don&#x27;t you at some point have a client (user-mode app, unikernel on Xen) use a stub/function in one space that gets redirected to code in NetBSD to execute it against the hardware? Seems like a similarity. However, this conversation has shown yours to be much more advanced and portable in design/implementation.<p>Similarities ended up being the main goal (driver/feature reuse), several areas of implementation (dependencies), hooking into a major BSD/Linux, and turning that into something supporting lightweight VM&#x27;s. Past that, your work is totally in it&#x27;s own category given its specifics and the no-fork focus. Congratulations on being original in a space where that&#x27;s uncommon. And the History indicates you got to originality by focusing on not being original (reusing code). Oh the ironies of life!<p>&quot;Not sure if you can manually manage a research database. Are we really not able to do that automatically in 2015, or is it just a question of nobody building the right kind of crawler/searcher? &quot;<p>You probably can. Datamining is outside of my expertise, though. I have over 10,000 papers on software engineering, formal verification, INFOSEC, tech like yours, etc. Quite a few are obscure despite totally solving a category of problem. That&#x27;s a start. Maybe a tech such as the open-source, DARPA-sponsored DeepDive can be used to sort it. Gives side benefit of overly-paranoids running screaming when they see &quot;Powered by DARPA tech&quot; in fine print under search. :O<p><a href=""http://deepdive.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://deepdive.stanford.edu/</a><p>&quot;The other problem is that most research tends to be conducted with a &quot;graduate-and-run&quot; method. The professor might have a more holistic vision, but the professor lacks a) time to engage in such discussion b) a grass-roots understanding.&quot;<p>Maybe have a solution to that. My collection was built and individual works evangelized with no participation on those groups part. Matter of fact, some were <i>very</i> hard to find with me adding a few gems from late 90&#x27;s just this month. The common denominator is that a description and PDF are published somewhere accessible to the public. If it&#x27;s a group (eg CS department), then it&#x27;s even easier to manually or automatically pull the research if they simply have a dedicated page for publications. If students don&#x27;t care & professors do, then professors might be willing to send in interesting work with pre-made tags, etc. Takes little time. Could even make students do it as part of requirements with a list of tags on web-site with suggestion capability for ease of use. Others digging through the database with motivation to build can pick up abandoned ideas.<p>As Jeremy Epstein at NSF told me, the biggest problem will probably be getting buy-in from schools outputing high-quality stuff. Without critical mass, it&#x27;s unlikely to go anywhere. However, I fight with myself over whether to push it anyway given that something good might come from it anyway much like Citeseerx&#x27;s passive collection. Even if only a few use it, something really good might come out of it and I&#x27;d hate to waste that potential. Internal struggle on that one as idealism and pragmatism rarely go in same direction in this field.<p>Anyway, glad you like the concept. Still getting 3rd party input before going all out with it.",1440961008

10144157,story,,,4,3,pegas1,"Why is it possible to set traffic lights wrong?",,"It seems like a rather simple algorithm to check if the traffic lights on a given intersection is set in a wrong/dangerous/conflicting way. Why is it not done?<p>Long story: I had a traffic an ugly traffic accident the last Friday. The area is new, all the traffic light equipment was installed recently. I had a green left arrow, so I was turning left. Three cars in front of me in the same left turning lane, one behind me. So I am sure I had the green arrow and also I am sure it was there when I was entering the intersection. Suddenly, there was a car approaching me going straight from the opposite direction. There was no time to avoid, just hit brakes and pray.<p>The girl driving the other car told me she had a green light too, going straight. I could not believe. So, I went to the intersection yesterday and watched lights. I had seen it: straight in one direction and green left arrow in the opposite direction overlapping for almost a minute.<p>I called the police to report the traffic hazard.<p>They did not sound surprised at all. I am assuming that there is a lot of software involved in traffic light control nowadays. Obviously, there are three independent inadequacies: (1) software that allows programming traffic lights in a dangerous way, (2) software that controls traffic lights and (3) the person who did the setup. Why is it not done the right way?",1440960917

Many parking garages have installed chargers. I charge at home in my garage. I wake up every morning with a full charge. Many people who&#x27;ve only owned gas-powered cars don&#x27;t consider this advantage.<p>A Nissan Leaf or a BMW i3 can only go 80 to 100 miles on the battery. But that covers the average commute of nearly every American commuter. With a charging place at work, you&#x27;d be able to swing a 70 to 100 mile daily commute and never need a public fast-charging infrastructure.

The amount of information available is simply crazy and &quot;normal people&quot; can rarely appreciate the subtleties of a disease and its treatments. Unfortunately, 10 years of training is impossible to squeeze in a few hours of reading.<p>That being said, Grade IV gliomas are usually being treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy (usually temozolomide).\nSurgery is either a biopsy or a resection. Glioblastomas have multiple &quot;roots&quot; making them very difficult to remove. Even after surgery they almost always recur. Sometimes they&#x27;re located in regions of the brain where the risk of surgery outweighs any benefit (for example, the patient would be left unable to talk after the surgery); then we do a biopsy and go on to the next &quot;step&quot;, which is radiation.<p>Radiation therapy is given daily over a few weeks. Based on a few factors such as age and general condition, the radiation oncologist will determine the dose and number of treatments (fractions) he recommends. Between 15 and 30 treatments is usual in patients that are in reasonable shape.<p>Again, based on general condition and a few other factors, someone (a neurosurgeon, medical or radiation oncologist) will prescribe temozolomide. It&#x27;s usually given during or after radiation. That medication really improved outcomes and is now considered standard of care in people that can tolerate it.<p>Despite our best efforts, the disease usually comes back. At that point options can be limited. Some people will try clinical trials, but before you start travelling with a loved one across the country, keep in mind a few important things: this is a deadly disease so quality of life becomes very important. Spending hours in hospitals trying out toxic treatments has an important impact on that. Moreover, I haven&#x27;t seen any breathtaking preliminary clinical trial results on GBM lately (that includes virus, weed and the likes). Participating in trials should be seen as a way to contribute to cancer research; I wouldn&#x27;t go into it expecting to find a cure.<p>If you really want to have access to the information physicians use, you should check out the NCCN guidelines on Central Nervous System Cancers. It&#x27;s NOT written for the general population and I would not advise you to even look it up. It can be really confusing and bring in more stress than it&#x27;s worth.

For example, if Haskell had only two available IO operations (read a character or print a character), the following would be a workable definition of the IO type:<p><pre><code>    data IO a = PutChar (Char, IO a)\n              | GetChar (Char -> IO a)\n              | Return a\n</code></pre>\nPrograms can work by constructing a value of type IO () and defining it as main, just like in regular Haskell. Note that IO is no longer a wrapped impure function, and there are no magical tokens in sight. In fact, the above implementation doesn&#x27;t even have to be opaque, it can be completely exposed to programmers. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s just as easy for the runtime to interpret in a sequential way, and there won&#x27;t be any problems with accidentally optimizing away or memoizing anything.",1440957950

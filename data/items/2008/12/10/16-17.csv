Judging by all the flight manuals in the garage, he flew pretty much everything in the USAF inventory.\nAnyway, although he and I never had much of a conversation, she said he was always very interested in what I was working on (medical software). He just wasn't very talkative outside his immediate family.",1228928296

393137,comment,392889,392889,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Speaking as another history undergrad, here's what I've found helpful:<p>Read HTDP (<a href=""http://htdp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://htdp.org/</a>), SICP (<a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/</a>), and/or CTM (<a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html</a>), and <i>do most of the exercises</i>. They're all huge books, but getting even halfway into any of them will cover a <i>tremendous</i> amount of material. Also, they focus on largely complementary material, and each may help clarify concepts you find puzzling in the others. Also, HTDP is probably the most approachable of the three. (The first two are available online, the third has a draft PDF floating around. There's something to be said for a hardcover on your desk, though.)<p>Also, find something you're seriously interested in and program for it. With an undergrad in history, you have quite a few niches to draw upon that most CS grads don't. (Python is one reasonable language for this. People will debate this endlessly, though; picking something and actually doing it is more important than getting bogged down in worrying about language differences, for your purposes. Having libraries relevant to your niche is also important.)<p>You will almost certainly need to learn C somewhere along the line; it's a good candidate for the lingua franca of algorithms. _The C Programming Language, 2nd ed._ by Kernighan & Ritchie is <i>the</i> book, and for good reason. Learning C will also get you intimately acquainted with many mistakes people frequently make, which will help hone your testing / debugging. (This is the upside of C making it easy to shoot yourself in the foot, I suppose.)<p>For math and algorithms, take your language(s) and dive in at Project Euler ( <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/</a> ), a series of math puzzles. Have fun with it, and dig deeper into any questions you don't understand or can't code a reasonably efficient solution for. The algorithmic insights will come when you read other peoples' solutions that solve the problem 1000x faster. :) Also, comparing both idiomatically similar and fundamentally different solutions to the same problem across several languages can teach you quite a bit.<p>For data structures (which you didn't explicitly mention, but will need along with algorithms), I found learning OCaml (via <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a> ) most helpful. ML is an <i>excellent</i> language family for expressing complex data structures, and a little experience with it will probably make thinking about them clearer, regardless of what language you're working in. (Other people will probably have better book recommendations, though.)",1228928235
393136,comment,393078,393078,0,0,answerly,,,"Check out usertesting.com.  I have had a lot of success using their service.  For about $19 you get a screencast and talk track of a user trying to complete certain goals (that you pre-determine) on your site.  Its not perfect, but it is a great way to get insights from 3-5 users that you can then use to create a larger survey for the rest of your user base.<p>My experience with surveys is that the more open ended you make them, the less valuable the feedback is.  I would try to come up with 4-5 questions tops.  Its a good idea to try and figure out what the theme of the survey is upfront (i.e. on core thing you want to be able to figure out from the survey data).  Some businesses try to cram too much into a single survey- I have had more luck with shorter surveys more frequently than less frequent long surveys.  Also, multiple choice and ""rate on a scale of 1-10"" questions have worked better for me than open ended text boxes.<p>As far as the audience for your survey, unless you have a very large user base you should send it to everyone.  Responses rates on surveys tend to be pretty low and you want to make sure you have enough data to draw conclusions from.",1228928172

393134,comment,392889,392889,0,0,gills,,,"My opinion might stray a little bit from some of the answers here.  I don't think a CS education is complete without an understanding of how the whole stack works.<p>So work through the Scheme lessons in SICP or HTDP, it's a fun and playful language!  You can easily build interesting algorithms and watch them in action to get a better feel for how computation behaves.  You will also be introduced to FP which will help you in the long run as a dev.<p>From there I like to think of two directions you could explore.<p>Down => compilers, OS design, processor/memory/machine architecture, networks, circuits, physics.<p>Up => automatons, language theory, complexity, ways to mitigate complexity (approximation, optimization, AI).<p>Sideways => the wide world of application programming.<p>It depends on what tickles you...but in my opinion a basic understanding across the spectrum will provide you with the framework to explore more specific areas without feeling lost.",1228928154

Also, I strongly prefer to be around people with a sense of humor.<p><i>Your advice for young programmers -- or for not-so-young programmers?</i><p>Programming is part of software development. It doesn’t matter how fancy your code is unless it solves the right problem and you can explain it to others. So, brush up on your communication skills. Learn to listen, to ask good questions, to write clearly, and to present clearly. Serious programming is a team sport, brush up on your social skills. The sloppy fat geek computer genius semi-buried in a pile of pizza boxes and cola cans is a mythical creature, best buried deep, never to be seen again.<p>Learn your first language well. That means trying it for difficult tasks. Don’t obsess about technical details. Focus on techniques and principles.<p>Learn another programming language; choose any language that’s quite different from what you are best acquainted with. You can’t be a professional in the IT world knowing only one language. No one language is the best for everyone and for everything.<p>Don’t just do programming. Computing is always computing something.

393079,story,,,6,18,tstegart,"Ask HN: Finding a job for the rest of my life",,"I’m facing a dilemma. How do I find a job I could love for the rest of my life? One that keeps me interested, fulfilled, happy, content. Or, alternatively, what can I do to make money that will let me be me on my own time. Its come to the time in my life when I need to take a sincere look at where my life is heading, and how I plan on living it. Some people call it growing up.<p>I’ve been slowly on a mission to discover things about myself. Why I don’t like certain things, what things I really love. The only problem is, the result doesn’t provide a clear solution to the problem of what I should try doing with my life.<p>The things I’ve discovered:<p>I love learning. It goes beyond mere excitement and borders on a psychological need. Maybe that is the wrong word, it is a need. I could go to school for the rest of my life. I ache to go back to classes, just for the idea that to sit in them would be fun. Even in my college days I hardly skipped class. I didn’t always do the homework, but I went to class anyways. I would read through my textbooks for fun. I go to the library and read books about subjects I don’t really need to know. I read in general, and I love every minute of it. I love exploring new places just to see them and eating new foods just because I wonder what its like to try them.<p>I would describe myself as a polymath, but that implies a certain amount of acclaimed accomplishment that goes along with the learning. Taking the time to be famous at something has never appealed to me, mostly because that time could be used to learn something new. But one of the best days in my intellectual life was finding the definition of that word, because it meant I was not alone in the world and that other people were like me.<p>I love thinking through problems. It’s the one thing I’m not humble about, I’m good at it. Thinking excites me, and thinking through things incites me more. I originally wrote “solve problems.” But that isn’t true. I love thinking of the solutions. But once the solution is thought of, I become disinterested. It requires someone else to put the solution into effect. To build the gadget, write-up the paper, complete the process. The problem is solved in my mind, but until someone else does the work it can’t really be said to be truly solved. But the thinking, ah, the thinking. That is truly where my mind can expand, can envision. I’m definitely a vision guy. I ask way too many questions, but I’m extremely good at throwing away useless information and working out a way to solve something, to get somewhere, to chose a path that will likely work.<p>I hate writing. I hate it with a mix of guilt and resignation. It took me forever to find this out, but again, it was such a relief. Every time I realized I did not like what I was doing, it was this. School was a blast until the night before papers were due. Tests? Sure, love em. Studying, of course! But papers? Writing? That’s where I get bogged down. I finally figured out that it was the ONLY thing I ever procrastinated on. Why? Because deep down I don’t like it. I end up disliking the jobs I have when writing becomes heavily involved. My thoughts have already moved on, they’re going new places and solving new problems. Putting the old thoughts into writing both bores and paralyzes me.<p>So what should I do with my life? How do I find something that will fulfill me? I’ve thought of academics. Being in a constant learning environment would be fun. I’ve though of those idea companies, where you solve problems, but I admit to a problem with execution. They both want you to solve the problem and execute the solution. I know I’ll hate those parts. So what’s out there for me?<p>I have found one thing that works, and that’s to take drudgery work. I worked in a factory, and I didn’t mind it. My current occupation is a big step up, I make a ton more money, but it’s the same. You do the same thing over and over for hours. Its enough that I can play close attention to what I need to do, but at the same time a little part of my brain can be thinking through things, solving little problems, or just dreaming up big ideas. It allows me to be me and still make the money I need. By the way, it not that I’m lazy. I’ve worked my share of long hours, both in factories during school and in my current occupation. I don’t mind the long hours as long as I don’t mind the work.<p>Sorry this is so long. Thank you to everyone who replies.",1228926339

I already have a feedback button on the site but I think the feedback it captures is only a small segment of my user's thoughts. If I do a survey, which users (heavy, light, new, old, all) should I send it out to and what other questions should I ask? Does anyone have a survey already prepared they'd be willing to share? - Thanks",1228926326

They can’t produce quality products as cheaply, as reliably, and as quickly as they would like. They correctly see a shortage of good developers as a part of the problem.  What they generally don’t see is that inserting a good developer into a culture designed to constrain semi-skilled programmers from doing harm is pointless because the rules/culture will constrain the new developer from doing anything significantly new and better.""<p>Wow.

This $100 store credit is going to end up selling MORE Apple hardware because everything is so expensive. People get to feel all warm and fuzzy again and Apple makes more money. It's amazing.",1189119313

51344,comment,51226,51279,0,0,forgotmylastone,,,"I am so pissed that my million dollar cancer treatment has come down in price to $500.  I mean, sure, I got treated two months ago, and I would be dead right now had I not, but that wasn't the point.  Living is nice, but what I <i>really</i> wanted from this cancer treatment was to live while <i>others who couldn't afford it</i> died.  I guess there is some small consolation in the fact that a lot of people died during a couple months there, but this whole thing just pisses me off.  I don't know if my slight, smug satisfaction at their deaths was worth the million bucks.  On a normal technology schedule, I would expect at least a year of deaths; didn't Apple know we were counting on that?  I hate you Apple.",1189118553

51342,comment,51226,51338,0,0,aston,,,"I agree this little detour is pretty wasteful, but while we're on it, I might as well clarify. The silencing comes by way of a disincentive to post your opinion, at least until it's clear that no one's going to downmod you for it. How powerful that disincentive is hinges mostly on how much you care for your karma. Even if you don't care at all, it's an expression that the community's not really welcoming you/your opinions. Ultimately, I think it leads down the path of group think, but maybe that's too dramatic as well. Anyway, I'm more than done here. My apologies for the derailing.",1189118411

51328,comment,51248,51321,0,0,nostrademons,,,"After SFP05, I took a realistic look at the product and my ability to complete it before competitors did and decided not to pursue it.  I took a job with another startup instead, first finishing up a long-time volunteer coding project I'd been working on.  It turns out the product (web-based collaborative editing) would've had a market, but I probably would have been crushed by Google.  They folded similar features into Google Docs not long afterwards.<p>After SFP07, we continued working on it.  We launched a side project (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16234"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16234</a> and <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18233"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18233</a>) and put about a month of effort into that before deciding it wasn't worthwhile.  We also launched an intermediate milestone that we'd mentioned in our application, which is linked in my profile.  It's had the same lack of success that we predicted, though I was of course hoping that there may be an off-chance of it taking off.  (We did it that way because we need the functionality anyway for the main idea, so might as well package it up and get feedback while we work on that.)<p>Well, some subset of ""we"".  We had applied with 5 founders, and PG immediately shot back an e-mail with ""too many uncommitted founders!""  It became apparent that he was right, so the 3 that were not really into it left a couple months later.  <p>Curiously, our schedule in the SFP07 app would've been nearly dead-on had we not done the 5-week side project.  We were initially planning to launch Diffle in late April; it actually launched on June 1.  Then we were going to prototype the main idea between then and the start of the SFP; we actually got our first prototypes done during the first week of July.  Progress since then has been slower than we anticipated, mostly because I kept the day job through the summer (I'm in the process of quitting now, and really would recommend that anyone in a similar situation quit as soon as they have an idea - it's not worth the hassle of ensuring you own your own IP).",1189116871

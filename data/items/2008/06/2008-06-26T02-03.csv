They have had Starcraft 2 what any other company would consider 'finished' for probably 2 years.  But they run massive beta tests, continually tweak and perfect the game.<p>It shows in every one of their products - look at the Starcraft/Warcraft/Diablo series - not a single flop or poor game.<p>I bet you right now that Starcraft 2 becomes even more popular than the original - and the original is still played in large numbers ten years later!",1214447564

JavaScript can also be used to re-write a webpage, including changing images, fetching more text, revealing optional form elements and the changing the destination of hyperlinks.<p>Some, if not all, of this can be achieved with IFrames and Flash but web browser security is such that you'd have to include JavaScript anyhow.",1214446796

An if statement inside a for loop inside a function inside a class is already 4 levels of indentation. Call a ten-letter function with three ten-letter arguments and you're over the limit.<p>It depends a lot on the style of code... some apis will have really long names and require a lot of arguments. In this case you'll run over 80 columns even if you use two-space indentation (which we do at my workplace).",1214446412

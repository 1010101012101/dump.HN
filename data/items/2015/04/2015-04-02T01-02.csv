9308246,comment,9306077,9306077,0,0,jdietrich,,,"This reads to me like a massive overthinking of a very old problem - bad products.<p>We used to have bad products that did a hundred different things badly, rushed out to meet an overambitious spec sheet and an unrealistic launch date. Now we have bad products that do one thing badly, rushed out because the Kickstarter money or seed funding has all been spent.<p>I think the author completely misses the mark on what these teams are getting wrong, and the solution to the problem. The products he describes have clearly had no small amount of effort put into the &quot;whole gestalt experience&quot;; The hardware he complains about looks beautiful, and I expect came in beautiful packaging and was sold with beautiful marketing. His gripes are straightforward engineering issues, mainly of poor software quality. There&#x27;s nothing romantic about refactoring and debugging. It doesn&#x27;t take any sort of deep philosophical insight to do proper QA.<p>If I may be somewhat blunt, I think that the answer is perfectly straightforward - stop buying unproven hardware just because it looks cool. Companies ship buggy, half-finished devices because the market makes it profitable to do so. Curb your enthusiasm and wait for version two. Pass over the hot new thing from the hot new startup, and buy something more pedestrian from a manufacturer with a proven track record. Ignore the glowing press reviews on launch day, and wait for the trickle of complaints on Amazon when the thing starts failing after three months.",1427939937

It is an off-the-shelf catalog item you can order from Panasonic.</i><p>Um, no. Viewing the battery of a Tesla Model S as just a big flashlight battery misses the whole point of what Tesla is doing.<p>A flashlight battery does one thing: it discharges energy until it&#x27;s empty. Even an ordinary rechargeable household battery only does two things: it recharges, and then it discharges.<p>The battery in a Tesla Model S, OTOH, is continuously <i>computing</i> whether to charge or discharge, how much to charge or discharge, what its current state of charge is, how to manage charging and discharging to maximize its life, etc. And it has to do this in a constantly changing environment--a car that is traveling at varying speeds over varying types of roads. (Doing it for a home battery is actually easier, in a way, because there is less variability in the load.)<p>This sort of technology is absolutely critical if batteries are going to become significant in our energy budget on a large scale. The energy storage medium of the battery is only a tiny piece of the whole picture.",1427939666

That&#x27;s about $25 (according to Google). Most of them run Android. Though, once Windows Phone 10 comes out, I&#x27;d be interested to see if that&#x27;s a better UX at the ultra-cheap end of the spectrum. Nevertheless, Android is currently the OS of choice at the low end, wherever you draw the line on acceptable UX. And the latest and greatest Android is available for about 4800rs, or about $77, running on a quad-core SoC.<p>As for how that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s because Android can aggressively &quot;swap&quot; (really serialize and reconstitute)background components out of memory, and it can do the same to whole processes. You can actually watch your Android app instance switch PIDs, as it comes back from having had all the components, and the underlying runtime instance, killed. Now, there are some fat slovenly apps out there that might not be happy with life in a very limited machine, but I bet those 1500rs phones push the minimum specs pretty damn hard.",1427939614

Somehow the entire supply chain has piked up a lot of overhead, and he realized it would be possible to reduce that. At those prices, Model-S battery pack costs are between $36k and $51k!<p>When I realized that, I came to conclusion that Tesla Motors could be viewed as merely a stepping stone on the way to building a Gigafactory.<p>When demand for batteries is low, a low-volume battery factory has to share its suppliers with other clients, and those suppliers will price their risks and profits into the deal, multiple times along the chain. On the other hand if you have enough volume to justify having the entire manufacturing cycle under one roof, from ore to ready packages, all those markups go out the window. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to see overhead going from the staggering 500% to a more moderate 50%, but only as long as there is enough demand for all of those batteries. Which is why you need cars - they consume a lot of energy.<p>By now it&#x27;s pretty much certain that Tesla will be the first to build a Gigafactory. The interesting bit is whether Musk figured out a way to make sure no one has the ability to build a competing Gigafactory and commoditize the business. Right now only Tesla itself can generate enough demand, so they are pretty safe. If Musk can convince the other car manufacturers to buy batteries from Tesla, it will kill the incentive for anyone else to build a competing Gigafactory for a long time. So at the least Musk needs to appear non-threatening to other car manufacturers, and perhaps the best move would be to split battery division away from Tesla Motors completely.",1427938569

Thanx helps merchants identify, reward, and retain their best customers. Launched in 2012, Thanx evolves the traditional customer loyalty program which is plagued with high integration costs for business owners and massive customer fatigue (think punchcards and plastic loyalty cards). Thanx makes the experience effortless for merchants and consumers alike. For consumers, earning rewards at their favorite merchants is as easy as paying as usual – gone are the hassles of check-ins, loyalty cards, or any added steps at checkout. Through Thanx, merchants can easily build personal relationships with their best customers – no point-of-sale integration or additional hardware required – taking advantage of automated retention marketing campaigns powered by Thanx. On average, Thanx merchants generate 30% increases in revenue from existing customers and experience drastically improved customer satisfaction. Backed by A-list venture firms Sequoia Capital and SoftTech VC, Thanx powers retention marketing for multi-location merchants across the United States. Over $15B in loyalty rewards were given out last year. Thanx brings a new, measurable and data-driven approach to a massive market that is waiting to be revolutionized.<p>Roles?
Entry-level sales candidates! We&#x27;re looking to expand the sales team at Thanx, as we&#x27;ve been growing a ton and recently raised our Series A with Sequoia Capital. We also just hired an excellent head of sales (he was one of the first hires at Groupon), who will be a great mentor to somebody looking to establish a career in sales.<p>How to apply?

They are also leaders in direct sales, JIT manufacturing, motor design, any one of which is a disruptive innovation channel they could monetize, all in the service of building electric cars. Tesla is an energy company, a battery company, a car company, etc, just as GE or any other innovator ends up in many segments. What they are is a nascent Multi-business, Multi-national company that the market is betting (based on the stock price) is going to be able to be a global force. A lot of publicly traded companies are single-business companies that derive most of their revenues from a domestic operation. The few companies that manage to become multinationals have this outsized influence because they tend to drive massive revenues, earnings, and markets caps. The correlation between operating in multiple business areas and being a massive multinational is a direct relationship, because disruptive businesses always reach a saturation point. Businesses like Tesla that set out to disrupt industries that represent significant portions of GDP will naturally need to move into multiple markets in order to execute their strategies, because they need to disrupt or create a sequence of disruptive or creative strategies in order to reach that saturation point (natural market size).<p>I love Elon for the fact that he thinks of his businesses on a planetary basis, and if you consider the point, you&#x27;ll see he&#x27;s actually executing Tesla in multiple markets simultaneously, and essentially going directly from startup to Multinational, and skipping the domination of a single category. He knows that if he doesn&#x27;t, he&#x27;s going to face stiff competition from entrenched companies and it&#x27;s likely he&#x27;ll lose his advantage. But by tight control of the supply line businesses, and a few strategic relationships with existing multinationals, he&#x27;s able to elevate Tesla into a multi-business, multi-national organization in record time.<p>Sure, they&#x27;re a battery company, but what they really are is an organization that&#x27;s shooting for the moon and actually executing at that scale.

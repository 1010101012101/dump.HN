You don't serve 21,000 requests per second. And you never will. Go and look at the size of your MySQL tables, then look at how much RAM your server has and what percentage of it is allocated to filesystem cache and how many real I/O reads/writes your hardware RAID does per second.

361484,comment,359737,360502,0,0,giles_bowkett,,,"I explained this in my blog a few posts ago. You write programs to focus on some particular aspect of your programming that you want to make better. I think it should be obvious. You use functional programming idioms - write programs that have using functional programming idioms well as their only purpose. You use regular expressions - write programs that only exist to make you better at regular expressions. In other words write a bunch of regular expressions and make them as good as you can.<p>In the Ruby community we have the Ruby Quiz. I'm pretty sure that's copied from some other community, I think Perl. Every programming language community has practices of this nature.<p>It's absurd to suggest that deliberate practice has anything to do with body memory <i>intrinsically</i>. How many times will you write a regular expression in your life? There's no element of repetition there? The literature on deliberate practice cites Mozart, Bobby Fischer, and Bill Gates. Body memory has nothing to do with it.<p>The feedback comes from sharing with others, as in the Ruby Quiz, or benchmarking your code, or posting it on a blog. Another form of feedback would be seeing if your programs run at all. ;-)",1226469021

I find that upmodding a post gives me the psychological fix I need to feel like I contributed to a conversation. Without that fix, I still feel compelled to get my own voice in, even if my comment will be redundant. So I find upmodding someone else's post that I agree with prevents me from adding noise to an existing conversation.<p>I naively assume (hope?) that all discussion will be intelligent, so I don't see any need to reward it.

Engineering is generally the most difficult program, so you'd expect that the dropout rates would be higher. I suspect there's also a number of transfers to less demanding programs baked in there.<p>Why should we want to minimize drop-out rates anyway? It doesn't necessarily indicate there's a problem with the curriculum - engineering <i>should</i> be a tough program. The only way you could minimize drop-outs would be to prevent all but the strongest students from entering in the first place. I think it's telling that the highly-selective schools have very low drop-out rates. Is MIT's methodology all that different from less selective universities? I doubt it.",1226468717

Old, actively maintained code, tends to be more reliable than new code.<p>- C tends to be employed in relatively predictable sub-systems.  Something like a device driver has a relatively predictable set of states relative to a GUI application.  There aren't that many paths.

361460,comment,361253,361253,0,0,netcan,,,"I think he is ignoring a (perhaps difficult) piece of reality. The lines have blurred of late between professional & amateur in all sorts of fields. The knowledge & abilities can be gained gradually & the tools are inexpensive.<p>There is no threshold where one becomes a professional designer, programmer etc. The neighbour's kid may be able to design your logo, install your shopping cart, etc. Some of them even do it well. Many do not.<p>A lot of the time the business owner hiring doesn't care too much about quality, isn't willing to pay for it or can't tell the difference. Making things worse is that a lot of the time the quality is not actually different or is equal to a lower tier of professionals making the price gap between medium & higher quality very high.<p>Look at it this way. Architects are largely shielded from this kind of mess. Legalities aside, people want pros & builders & engineers will probably refuse to work with amateurs. Interior designers may have the potential to add as much or more to a given project, but they will usually be excluded. You or your wife or boyfriend (or both) or your kid will have a crack at it. The guy at the furniture store will give you advice. Your accountant thinks that looks nice over there.<p>Now interior designers can lament the fact that you don't know the slightest thing about creating spaces, positioning, making use of light & all those things. You've made all the textbook errors. You're not utilising the building you paid so much to have designed. You made the most basic mistakes.<p>But this is the nature of the game when amateurs get to play. Graphic designers (& to a certain extent programmers) have moved from being architects (& lawyers & dentists) to being interior designers, caterers & piano teachers<p>That doesn't mean the profession disappers. But it means you have a certain market imbalance that follows. The bottom tier of service is no longer really needed.<p>1. The mechanic who used to get his card designed by the cheapest or closest guy gets his grandmother to do it free. He doesn't care what paper she uses. He may be wrong to do so, but tuff.<p>2. There are lots of people who are on the border of 'professional' that enter the market. Either in their skill or in their attitude. They can enter with this approach since entry barriers are pretty much $0. Usually they go by the title freelancer. Since you have this influx now competing with the previous cheap guys, for a market that is now smaller, prices drop.<p>Sprinkle in bidding sites & globalisation of labour, stir. Prices dropping, guys in slipknot tshirts bidding at under minimum wage & fighting for business. Not fun for the previously professional freelancer.<p>The answer of course is to go higher market. You may cater your own party yourself, but you're not expecting the queen of Belgium to. You know that $30 a martini bar got a professional interior designer in. Their prices are probably unaffected by any drop in the price of starting a business in their sector.",1226468145
361459,comment,359737,360034,0,0,giles_bowkett,,,"this is why these sites are doomed, dude. any site built on this model of news dissemination is doomed. putting out a flag button makes your site vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. it's in everybody's group interest to only flag spam, but it's in everybody's personal interest to flag anything <i>they</i> don't want to see again. these sites are so intrinsically vulnerable to tragedies of the commons that we might as well call them sheep pastures.<p>they make the same mistake here that everybody else makes with tagging. if you look at the research on tagging, the big tagging success story was delicious - which leveraged SELF-INTEREST in its tagging system and produced a useful public resource as an emergent byproduct. this is not coincidence! read James Surowiecki. seriously. economics 101 for social software.<p>leveraging independent self-interest is <i>THE</i> key factor which differentiates the wisdom of crowds from the stupidity of groupthink. ""the wisdom of crowds"" is really just a reiteration of adam smith's invisible hand. to create an invisible hand effect, you <i>must</i> leverage independent self-interest within a shared context where independent self-interested actions are <i>visible</i> to other independent self-interested agents.<p>every tagging system that fails to leverage self-interest fails to capture that. you can't just sprinkle magic web 2.0 fairy dust on something and go ""Tagging!"" if you want delicious results, you have to find out what made delicious work and emulate that. what made delicious work was a fundamental principle of economics. the reason so many sites have useless tags is that their makers are <i>ignoring</i> this fundamental principle. it's cargo cult site design.<p>similarly, this flagging nonsense flat-out ignores <i>another</i> basic fundamental of economics. what makes it even <i>more</i> insane is that <i>Paul Graham</i> already explained in one of his first blog posts about Bayesian filtering <i>exactly</i> why spam filters should be tuned to an <i>individual's</i> preferences and not to a group's. if you had a bunch of individually-tuned spam filters, you could find a way to leverage that. since you have a group-tuned spam filter, you have nothing but a tragedy of the commons magnet.<p>anyway, just ranting about why Hacker News should hurry up and cease to exist already.<p>edit: just for the record I'm responding to Reg's comment.

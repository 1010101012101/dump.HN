8251592,comment,8250270,8250705,8,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> The most surprising discovery for me was that it seemed like after foreign language students the heaviest users of the service were education majors. No joke. I never figured out if the noticeably heavy use by education majors was a selection bias caused by the way the service was advertising itself, a sign of especially low ethics among education majors, or an indication that there might be a higher incidence of lifestyle factors (e.g. going to school while working full time) that made it difficult for them to crank out all the BS assignments required of them.<p>Not a huge mystery here; check the average GRE scores by major here (2001-2004, but the general effect is well documented): <a href=""http://www.ncsu.edu/chass/philo/GRE%20Scores%20by%20Intended%20Graduate%20Major.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncsu.edu/chass/philo/GRE%20Scores%20by%20Intended...</a> . Data provided is average GRE score in Verbal, Quantitative, and writing sample, for 50 majors. Here are #s 41-50 in verbal, along with some reference points:<p><pre><code>     1. Philosophy (589)\n    25. Business - Bank. and Fin. (476)\n    41. Engineering - Industrial  (440)\n    42. Business - Administration\n    43. Education - other (437)\n    44.  Home Economics [?!]\n    45. Education - Special (432)\n    46. Education - Counseling (428)\n    47. Social Work\n    48. Education - Administration (427)\n    49. Education - Early Childhood (418)\n    50. Business - Accounting (415)\n</code></pre>\nHere are the same in Quantitative:<p><pre><code>     1. Physics/Astronomy (738)\n    25. Education - Secondary (577)\n    41. Education - other (531)\n    42. Social Sciences - other\n    43. Education - Elementary (527)\n    44. Education - Administration (523)\n    45. Public Administration\n    46. Education - Special (502)\n    47. Education - Counseling (500)\n    48. Home Economics\n    49. Education - Early Childhood (495)\n    50. Social Work (468)\n</code></pre>\nThere are four education majors which <i>don&#x27;t</i> make the bottom 20% cutoff: Education - Secondary, Education - Higher, &quot;Education - Curr. & Instr.&quot;, and &quot;Education - Eval. & Res.&quot;. They hold ranks 21, 30, 32, 37 (V) and 25, 34, 35, 39 (Q). So to sum up -- it&#x27;s a &quot;lifestyle&quot; factor; it&#x27;s harder for education majors to crank out their assignments because, compared to other students, they&#x27;re not very smart. What you&#x27;re seeing is not lesser ethics but greater need.",1409547332

He will sit and watch lecturers and all the videos in sequence and take copious notes. Not me. Unless it&#x27;s something complex and physical (like changing a car part) I can&#x27;t abide video instruction. I don&#x27;t care for audio much either. It&#x27;s too slow and you can&#x27;t skim picking out relevant points, nor refer back up quickly to refresh a concept. I don&#x27;t think my co-worker does this. If he did prefer to read, he would start reading, read every word and not go back to what he read before until he was finished.<p>Having observed the difference in our learning style and our relative skill set, it appears (from my biased point of view) that I know a lot more than he does, and I get a lot more done.<p>But it would be interesting to hear my co-workers take on me.

If people talk honestly about why they did things and weren&#x27;t obviously trying to do ill from the start, it&#x27;s pretty easy to empathize.<p>I read that the participants in the Milgram experiments were _way_ disproportionally likely to be conscientious objectors later in life, and that they attributed this to having been in the experiments.  I hope that I&#x27;ve been immunized like they were.<p>We were crazy careful about screwing up people&#x27;s machines, because anything that we did that made it seem to malfunction would likely result in them reinstalling the OS over us, and while we had some ideas about how to persist across a reinstall, it was a few bridges too far.<p>I certainly can&#x27;t say that we avoided all catastrophe, but I&#x27;m not aware of us ever causing one.  We had pretty good abstractions: the stack-shuffling code was fully encapsulated so that it wasn&#x27;t just littered about our normal code, etc..<p>We also tried pretty hard to avoid the really dangerous stuff.  It sounds crazy to put arbitrary code in some random process, but if you know that it doesn&#x27;t leak, and it never interacts with other threads in the process, it&#x27;s not really _that_ risky, really.<p>One thing that probably also helped is that we had so much feedback from the individual ad clients.

On average, we scheduled 40 man hours for each flight hour (sometimes as high as 60). The F/A-18&#x27;s that eventually replaced the Tomcats took about half that, but for most aircraft you&#x27;re looking at 10 MMH/FH, at least, for mx alone.<p>That said, not all aircraft are created equal, and not all those Tomcats required all 40 scheduled man hours. Maintenance manning, at least in the Navy, is largely determined by man hours. So it isn&#x27;t uncommon for commands to log as many hours as they can to keep billets, and possibly get a few additional ones. Billets are taken away if you show you can operate at fewer man hours.",1409546399

8251569,comment,8248869,8248869,13,0,bane,,,"I taught an advanced adult course for a number of years. I taught something north of 700 students in 40 and 80 hour courses over that time. I also later developed curriculum for another instructional program involving around 300 hours of instruction time that taught complex technical skills to another 300 people (equivalent to 2 B.S. degrees in terms of class-time) and graduated them as instructors in their subject. So I feel comfortable claiming I&#x27;m a professional educator (at least with adults). I also feel comfortable claiming that there are definitely different learning styles.<p>In addition, after being identified as a &quot;special gifted student&quot;, I myself went through a nonstop progression of tests and evaluations as a student starting in elementary school and continuing all through high school so I&#x27;m extremely familiar with the tests and results being talked about here.<p>I&#x27;d say as both a subject of these tests and as a former professional educator, yes, absolutely, students have different learning styles. But I agree with the article that the kinds of styles and methods used to identify the learning modes don&#x27;t really work.<p>Even worse, once students learn the results of these diagnostic tools, they use this knowledge as a kind of crutch to explain areas they are weak in. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a term for this phenomenon. Students then expect the teacher to treat them as a special snowflake and teach in the mode that they believe they learn most naturally in.<p>I believe that these diagnostic tools are being used incorrectly. They should be used to identify where students have weak modes of learning, and then their education should focus on building up those modes, not streamlining the educational process for efficiency and optimizing only for where students are <i>already</i> strong.<p>It&#x27;s like a person who already has strong biceps doing nothing but curls in the gym and not only skipping leg day, but telling everybody else in the gym that they don&#x27;t do legs because they&#x27;re biceps are already well developed and their legs don&#x27;t work so well.<p>This is a continuation of the notion that public education is an assembly line process like building cars and needs to optimize for the fastest way to shove knowledge into a student&#x27;s head. This is a hopelessly dead-end approach to pedagogy.<p>Education should be about teaching people how to learn themselves. If a student opens up multiple modes of learning, they can already multiply their capacity to learn. If you are weak in an area, then you should concentrate in that area. Learning is both a talent and a skill that needs cultivation.",1409546303

Maneuver dynamics is really, really hard to do, as the time scales of the problem are long (ships turn on the order of a minute), something very challenging for CFD to accurately represent.  Also, accurate free surface liquid dynamics is really damn hard to do, and I&#x27;d be skeptical of of most model&#x27;s accuracy.  I certainly wouldn&#x27;t make billion dollar decisions on it.<p>In aerodynamics, which has had much more time and money invested, CFD can almost completely replace the wind tunnel, but only for aerodynamics problems we understand (ie wings, fairings, nacelles, turbine blades, backward facing steps, etc). As soon as you leave the validated/understood world, CFD becomes a tool used to augment the designer&#x27;s intuitions, with the wind tunnel providing an essential ground truth.<p>Fluid dynamics is the business of predicting complex nonlinearities to a few %, and imo, complex nonlinear models are only useful when validated.\nIt&#x27;s telling that when they debated building the DDG1000 they built a 1/4 scale ship:<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Advanced_Electric_Ship_Demonstrator.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Advanced_...</a>",1409545969

It&#x27;s so bad that, after an organizational change, even if there is no logical reason that this change should affect the software running the bank at all, it will anyway, because some existing piece of technology was the old guy&#x27;s pet project, and so the new guy needs his own pet project. And all projects are pet projects. And so on.<p>And that&#x27;s just on the tech side. Of course, on the business side, technology is a cost to be grudgingly paid out and worked on, at best. And once the technical debt gets to be unworkable, someone comes up with the great idea to hand everything over (or in pieces, whatever) to a vendor. But then eventually the cost structure there gets too onerous as well, and so the business tries to replace it in-house again, after spending the last decade clearing out all their in-house expertise. And so the cycle continues.<p>Some banks are worse than others, but if this article has you thinking that maybe at Goldman Sachs, or Credit Suisse, or Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank, technology isn&#x27;t an absolute shit-show, well think again. And these places run the world economy while their technological infrastructure is held together by duct tape.<p>The article is right, of course, that banks will still be around in 20 years. Obviously. But, the big banks have known they need to get their act to together for, at the very least, forty damn years. And not a single one of them (not one!) has done it. And they never will, because they are dominated by a culture going back two hundred years that will not ever let engineers anywhere near the levers of the business, which is where they need to be, and for that matter will most of the time not invest profits back into the business when they can funnel it into their own bonus instead.<p>If you want to disrupt banks, start a bank! Start a bank where you can do things and enter markets that the big guys can&#x27;t, because their tech is half-assed and they aren&#x27;t creative enough to do anything about it. Finance is in need of disruption, and the potential windfall to pulling it off is enormous, but you aren&#x27;t going to get there by selling to existing players.",1409545753

8251539,comment,8250052,8251099,7,0,mattknox,,,"Yeah, I learned tons about Windows internals.  Three standouts:<p>1: We never hit a limit to what you could do to the stack.  It was trivial to write a function F that would fake the stack such that you would then &quot;return from&quot; some other function G (that had never actually been called) to yet a third function H that did something you wanted.  This turned out to be useful in creating self-deleting executables.<p>2: There were several cases in which backward-compatibility APIs created opportunities for the clever.  One example was the handling of registry strings.  They are, internally, WinNT counted unicode strings, but are generally accessed by older Win32 apps, which use C strings. This means that you could create a registry key using the WinNT APIs, where the string identifier for the key had a null byte in the middle.  Then Win32 apps (like some written by competitors to kill our apps, and also regedit) would be unable to do anything to that registry key, because it literally could not express the key&#x27;s name.<p>3: windows is CRAZY hackable.  It supports an API called CreateRemoteThread, which lets you start a thread in some other, random process, running arbitrary code that you specify.  This means that if you can get a file down to the machine and execute it, it can load a bunch of bytes into memory, tell other processes to execute them, and terminate, using 1: above to delete itself.  This made it a fairly hard target for most removal techniques-you&#x27;d have to find all the threads, out of all the threads running on the system, that were running my code, and kill them before they could replicate into another process and/or find the processes that were killing their siblings and retaliate.<p>Windows also allows random processes to tell the OS that they are SO IMPORTANT that the OS should immediately BSOD on that process terminating.  We never used that one.<p>As far as stuff I still use today, no specific technical techniques, but lots of general things:<p>- It&#x27;s crazy how fast you can level up with a hard problem and room to run.  I knew basically nothing when I started, and within a year or so, the team I ran and I had done some pretty cool stuff, and beat the hell out of a lot of other companies.  For a while, I was told that installing our adware was the best way to uninstall some obscure but horrendous russian malware.<p>-Tools trump humans.  Lots of other companies were trying to clobber us at the same time we were clobbering them.  We mostly won, and in several cases completely ran the table against the other company. (by which I mean we wiped them completely off the machines that had both their client and ours, without losing a significant number of machines ourselves).  It wasn&#x27;t that they were dumb or we were geniuses, but we would write like 10 lines of scheme and they would have to write a whole new executable, probably a few thousand lines.  Probably lots of coders were faster than us, but not many were 100X faster.<p>There were probably others, but those are the standouts.",1409545449

Then she would know the the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control.<p>&quot;She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time. This was in about 1947 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the conditions and see what happened.&quot;<p>I can tell you that this attitude hasn&#x27;t changed since the time of Feynman&#x27;s essay (1974), indeed it seems to have gotten worse.<p>By the way, here&#x27;s the &quot;punch line&quot; from Feynman&#x27;s famous essay:<p>&quot;I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call <i>cargo cult science</i>. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they&#x27;ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he&#x27;s the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They&#x27;re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn&#x27;t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they&#x27;re missing something essential, because the planes don&#x27;t land.&quot;",1409545302

8251489,comment,8251356,8251405,5,0,lutusp,,,"Scale models of nautical craft have always been limited by some unrealistic assumptions -- assumptions that are recognized but not well-adjusted for.<p>One important aspect of a scale-model ship/boat is that as you change the size of a model but keep the relative dimensions constant, its surface area changes as the square of its length, but its mass and volume change as the cube. If you  halve the size of a model, its surface area is 1/4 the original, but its volume and mass will be 1/8 the original. Simply put, this means a scale model won&#x27;t behave very much like the full-size craft.<p>As models become more sophisticated, these unavoidable limitations of scale modeling begin to argue for computer modeling, where you can model the full-size vessel using a carefully designed numerical simulation, including many factors that can&#x27;t be realistically modeled in a laboratory tank experiment.",1409544278

What if you&#x27;ve lot your key and you need to access the server for reasons such as getting the data out, how do you do it without root and without login password? Is there a way to go around this issue? Let me know if there is because right now, I have login password that I don&#x27;t re-use. Well, I guess for real deployment, serving real users, you&#x27;d have shading and a good central logging system so losing an instance is not a big deal, but for me I run a personal server and this is so far the way I protect myself (have login and ssh) in the case of lossing my key :(<p>Anyhow, DO droplets allow people to &quot;reset&quot; root password and it is important to protect your DO account.",1409544177

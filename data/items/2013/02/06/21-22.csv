Very annoying problem and incredibly hard to debug. We'd replaced just about every piece of hardware except for a stupid little T-connector. My buddy Jasper and me looked at it and we both more or less at the same time said 'it can't be'.

5179072,comment,5157760,5159012,1,0,nessus42,,,"Cognitive Psychology is a scientific field. It is different from ""Psychology"" though, an in fact it repudiates Behavioral Psychology, for instance. Cognitive Psychology is quite distinct from CBT, so criticisms of CBT do not apply to Cognitive Psychology.<p>The claim that the mind does not exist is a throwback to the dark ages of Behaviorism. They made this claim because they sought to make psychology only about things that can be very easily measured and very easily modeled. They claimed that this was ""scientific"", and that any talk of the mind was ""unscientific"". It was the Behaviorists, however, who were unscientific. In their goal to elevate Psychology past the unfalsifiable claims of Freudianism, etc., they made a model that was far too simple, and they ignored all the evidence that a more sophisticated model was necessary, and to make matters worse, they actively acted to suppress science done with more sophisticated models (i.e., Cognitive Psychology), holding the field back by decades.<p>As to claiming that you can't photograph or weigh minds, this is a non sequitur. You can't photograph or weigh a computer program either. A computer program is a mathematical entity that can be instantiated on hardware, but is distinct from the hardware and is as non-corporeal as is the number 2. The mind is the software of the brain, and Cognitive Psychology is the field that aims to reverse engineer this computer program. Neuroscience, no doubt, has compatible goals, which is why at MIT Neuroscience and Cognitive Psychology are in the same department.<p>In any case, you do the world no favors by promulgating Behaviorism's ill-conceived notion of science and their specious reasoning.",1360187562

The Ivy League is way too weak on socioeconomic diversity.<p>I think a classic, and rather accurate criticism of efforts to increase diversity is the notion of what ""diversity"" actually means.  How many students does Harvard have who grew up in trailer parks in Appalachia?  Certainly these students, culturally, would be more different, and therefore increase ""diversity"" more than a black student raised by a wealthy family in a New England suburb.  What about an Asian student who is from a poor Hmong family in Minnesota?  It seems current admission policies would lump her in with all of the other Asian students which the Ivy League has used a defacto cap to limit.<p>What has always been weird to me is the widespread observation (and most certainly accurate) that organizations with huge gender imbalances are more prone to weird groupthink type issues (Wall Street's excessive risk taking, hospital nurse/elementary school infighting), and a constant notion of ""we need more women here.""  But when companies try to talk about solutions, there is suddenly a requirement to view women as exactly the same as men.  If the effect of having more women in an organization will change the organization (for the better, according to research), it is very likely that women have some inherent attributes which make them differ from men.",1360185505

However, we have had extensive experience tracking down build and test failures caused by cross-language builds where a Python snippet embedded in another language, for instance through a SWIG invocation, is subtly and invisibly broken by a change in the indentation of the surrounding code. Our position is therefore that, although spaces for indentation is nice for small programs, it doesn't scale well, and the bigger and more heterogeneous the code base, the more trouble it can cause. It is better to forgo convenience for safety and dependability, so Go has brace-bounded blocks.<p><a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a>",1360185070

What I was looking to do was just give each navigation item an extra layer.

You'd go down another layer where you could scan through a minimal list within the menu. You could still click to go through to the respective page, but you wouldn't be forced to as you would with a standard navigation menu.<p>I suppose Facebook does this with their notification icons. You can see your messages and friend requests without leaving the page. Or you can choose to ""view all"" and go to a new page.<p>I personally find this useful. But I wonder if others feel the same?

If you hired an actual studio than chances are they have a site with contact information.

If their site doesn't have their contact information you can always run a whois on their domain and possibly get an email address or phone number.

There was a much more serious implementation flaw this summer: common SSL implementations could be spoofed by embedding NUL characters in certs. Every time something like this gets found, the protocol gets <i>stronger</i>, not weaker.<p>(4) The odds of you or me or anyone else on Hacker News developing a crypto transport for which an attack as slick as this would be required are basically nil.<p>(5) This isn't so much a TLS problem as it is an HTTP + TLS problem. The core issue is that HTTP doesn't really understand how TLS works; it looks like TLS appeared to give HTTP the ability to ""upgrade"" a connection, when in fact that TLS really does is ""tunnel a new"" connection. HTTP could have had a ""369 PROVIDE CLIENT CERTIFICATE"" error code instead of trying to reneg connections.<p>I should end with a question. Questions usually seem to stop you cold. So here's mine: name the widely-used cryptographic transport protocol that someone invented that <i>didn't</i> subsequently have very serious flaws uncovered in it.",1257403010

These aren't mutually exclusive (Phil Ivey, for example), but it seems that your impression of pro poker players is of the 'TV-pro' variety.<p>Players who rely on winnings for their livelihood do meet the author's description. In particular, for online poker players, the # of hands per year can total in the millions, and you can get pretty specific about the types of strategies/decisions that will alter your bottom line. I played poker online pretty seriously (and profitably) for about 2 years, logging over a million hands, and I definitely did no self-promotion.<p>Check <a href=""http://www.pokertableratings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pokertableratings.com/</a>, a site that logs all hands played at the major poker websites. A major statistic is BB/100 (big blinds won per 100 hands), which is an oft used metric for profitability. The online poker community has a very good idea of the expected BB/100 at various skill levels/stakes, and the associated variance - it's very much a 'science'.

It showed using statements, a namespace, the program entry point, and other boilerplate. While I agree that C# has a non-trivial class boilerplate and non-zero function boilerplate, the Clojure you quoted doesn't even show any function boilerplate (defn foo [args] body)<p>I compared a C# 3 expression to a Clojure expression.<p>And that bit of Clojure that you quoted uses helper functions which are not defined. The C# version of that is:<p><pre><code>  (from asset in assets
   let liquidValue = GetLiquidValue(asset)
   where DoubleMargin(asset, liquidValue)
   select liquidValue).Sum()

923451,comment,923214,923258,0,0,btilly,,,"It depends which pros you're talking about.<p>Certainly well-known poker players are happy to take advantage of any chance to make money with less risk.  Therefore you'll rarely see them turn down opportunities to do an endorsement, be on TV, write articles, and so on.  The ones who get that opportunity are not always the best.  It is also clear that the chance to do this is a significant motivation to participate in tournaments.<p>However most pros make significant money day in and day out playing cash games.  In fact most live on that.  And I guarantee that you aren't going to make money on cash games with just a little bit of initial luck.  I also guarantee that if you lack skill and play those cash games, you'll get wiped out.<p>And the pros who make a living online?  I guarantee they have skill!

923449,comment,923439,923439,0,0,tptacek,,,"Ouch.<p>So, here's what's up: applications that rely on client certificates (where the client had to have a valid, accepted cert to make a request) can, on most servers, be coerced into accepting unauthorized requests.<p>Most applications HN people are familiar with don't use client certificates. They're cumbersome, but (the conventional wisdom goes) much more secure, because the client has to cryptographically prove their identity.<p>But lots of important high-security apps do require client certs, including SSL-VPNs.<p>The problem boils down to this: when you connect to (say) a web app that wants a client cert, the client usually doesn't offer their cert first, and the server can't tell if the client even needs to do that until it routes the request. During that window of time, the SSL client is anonymous. When you hit a resource that needs a client cert, the web server tells TLS to renegotiate the session to get the client cert --- <i>but it can't throw away the data from the anonymous portion of the connection</i>.<p>So, if you're a man in the middle, you can stuff an HTTP request into an anonymous session, then splice the client to the server for the renegotiation, and you got to send a free request. You can't see the response (it's encrypted under the new TLS session, which is now cryptographically protected from you), but you were able to make a potentially dangerous request that appeared authenticated.<p>There's more about this attack at this link, including a PDF report on the general problem of client renegotiation:<p><a href=""http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8</a>",1257402286

As far as I know, not many new code projects are being done on mainframes. But whatever is there, has to be maintained/upgraded. Mainframes are <i></i>NOT<i></i> as difficult to use as the author says. They power most of the big life/general insurance companies, and they do interface well with front-ends [with XSLs in middle to convert from/to string streams].

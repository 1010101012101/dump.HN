1963442,comment,1962527,1963344,0,0,kj12345,,,"But the way this is working is by looking at the depth buffer and replacing only the person. So you could invert that mask and use this for chroma keying the person into a different environment. Then if you had depth info for the environment shot, you could potentially simulate a light and cast shadows from the person into the environment, and so on.<p>Long story short I think most Kinect hacks will be theoretically possible with 2d image analysis, but its more the speed of iteration and simplicity of these solutions that's interesting. For a similar scenario look at the way many modern game engines use a ""g-buffer"" which includes depth and surface normal info to create more realistic effects:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading</a>",1291319927

1963438,comment,1962554,1963118,0,0,zach,,,"Neat app and one of the best examples of a keep-it-simple webapp I've seen.<p>But let's talk about the ID.  Sure, it's a hundred and forty trillion, but it's also less than 48 bits.  Note that every visit to the site's root URL generates a new ID, and compare with The Fridge which (very reasonably) uses a 128-bit-equivalent ID: 25 alphanumerics!<p>I'm not buying this ""hard to type"" argument.  First, an app would ideally just allow you to get a more-typable version if you specifically request it.  Second, how often are you typing in IDs?  When the URL is on paper or on another device? I'm thinking it's not often enough to truly affect usability.  Third, I use a keyboard that doesn't even have a numpad and somehow I get by.<p>Finally, let's say we spec out that we do want at least 47 bits of IDs.  The site can get there by using 10 lowercase letters or 8 of all alphanumerics.  Game over.  Now the lowercase option comes down to adding two characters for the sake of better typability, which is a crummy trade.  Not only for Twitter reasons but because the longer the URL is, the less shareable it looks.",1291319752

There is just too much complexity that emerges in places which are difficult-to-impossible to anticipate until I've dug into code and physically tested the ideas I've laid out in pseudo-code. I'd probably put the number more in the range of 25-50% depending on the scope of the project.<p>Of course for simpler projects or in domains where the developer is extremely experienced and can anticipate every hiccup that might occur, that number could go much higher, but I don't think this is usually the case in the wild.",1291319584

They could have spent that money buying fiber backbones, 4G Spectrum, clean or solar energy plants.<p>I would have much rather seen google branch out more into infrastructure then into another consumer facing web play, especially one with such a long window on ROI. Its not necessarily about having the money or not so much as how could that money have been better spent.<p>A nice counter example, in 2007 MS bought 1.5% of Facebook for 250M at a valuation of 15B. Currently Facebook shares are selling at a valuation between 100B and 200B - split that down the middle and that MS investment is now worth $2.5B, which makes their small investment in FB look a heck of a lot better then Google's Acquisition of YouTube.<p>EDITS - I keep adding to this point, I apologize.  Most of this comes off of realizing that Google didn't even pay cash for YouTube, it was a stock acquisition.<p>NOTE: I should also say as an armchair analyst I thought Google's purchase of YouTube at the time was pretty good and MS's investment at the time in Facebook was pretty bad.

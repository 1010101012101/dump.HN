However, virtual offices such as Sococo are changing that.  I propose a online communal workspace / incubator.  I imagine mentors and investors becoming a part of the hand selecting / demoing / and fund raising processes.  I've written up some my thoughts at www.dotincubate.com.   Certainly there are advantages to working in the same room, in fact, some investors might not even consider a team if they didn't.  But I think with increasingly advanced communication platforms,  some great teams can form that wouldn't otherwise be possible.  This provides unique advantages to telecommuting teams and they deserve their own incubation spaces to further their chances of success.  What do you think.. yea or nay?",1306720586

2598181,comment,2595952,2598076,1,0,jgesture,,,"Making a general statement about American culture, which I did, doesn't, necessarily, say anything about the details of the culture. As you suggest, and as I've also generally observed, among the Asian Americans that I've met, they tend to retain a culture that's more interested in academics than what is generally found in the American culture.<p>I think you allude to a good point that I would like to restate.<p>In this study, and in others like it, the blame seems to be put on the educational institution. But, it's not hard to see places where success is gotten independent of the institution (like, for your example, Asian Americans). So, it seems wrong to put all your faith in and all the blame on the institution.<p>I've tutored 100s of people and I've done lots of independent learning and, based on my interactions, I think I can say that the schools could be changed however you want and they won't fix the problem in America. See, the students that I've tutored didn't mainly have a problem in understanding the material, as far as I could tell, they had a problem in not wanted to learn. And, if I can teach myself calculus, physics and programming, you don't need schools to learn things.<p>As far as I can tell, one large problem is that, in America, it's more prestigious to be a manager, lawyer or securities trader than it is to be an engineer or scientist. Engineering and science is associated with curiosity and learning (things good schools should have), the other disciplines are more associated with prestigious and financial comfort and generally are not as socially or economically valuable.

I'm doing mainly RoR work and as such, setting up development environments on each of these three machines and keeping them relatively in sync is quite a pain.<p>I've been tossing around the idea of running an EC2 instance with Ubuntu on it, getting it set up to use as a development desktop and remoting in with NXWindows. As far as practicality goes, this (in theory) should work rather well, but I'm open to other ideas for doing the same sort of thing.<p>Has anyone done something similar before? Any tips, recommendations, etc? Thanks!",1306717704

2598065,comment,2597397,2597707,5,0,jcr,,,"tptacek, you built a false dichotomy, and then you pretended I said it\nso you could have a straw man to knock down. We can laugh about it over\na beer the next time you visit the valley.<p>When a friend tells me I'm trolling, even unintentionally trolling, and\neven if it was expressed through a fallacious argument, it's time to\nstop and rethink.  Something is definitely wrong.<p>I seriously thought about just dropping this, not responding and letting\nthis thread die of natural causes. But I would be setting a bad example\nby doing nothing, or taking it privately to email. $DIETY knows HN needs\nmore good examples of responding properly under pressure on contentious\nissues, and with some luck and effort, I'll hopefully write one.<p>It seems tptacek meant ""Web-as-we-know-it"" but I really do get his \npoint; people are now accustomed to executing code from any source via\nweb browsers and javascript. It undeniably is the status quo. Me and my\noutdated, curmudgeonly views have never agreed with the idea of\nexecuting code from any source. I am undoubtedly a minority.<p>The problem is, why is it such a terrible sin to question if the risks\nare worth the rewards, voice flaws in the design, and try to look for\nbetter alternatives? --In other words, why is everyone forced to accept\nthe ""as-we-know-it"" part without question?<p>Wanting to improve the as-we-know-it is vastly different from wanting to\nabandon everything.  I'm always in favor of trying to improve the status\nquo. I know for certain the same is true for tptacek and although I\ndon't know him, I'd bet the same is true for daeken.<p>It's safe to say all of us ""violently agree"" that there is no such thing\nas perfectly secure code, and it makes no difference if the code is only\nhandling data or if it is attempting to execute other code in a\nsandboxed virtual machine such as javascript.<p>Javascript has unimaginably huge investment and momentum behind it. The\noverwhelmingly vast majority of people have a vested interest in\njavascript, either as a company or developer, but also as just a user.\nIt won't be abandoned overnight. Similar is true for other problematic\naspects of the web including CSS and frames. In short, there is a damn\ngood reason why unpopular views are <i>very</i> unpopular --Billions (if not\nmore) of investment would be lost if these things were abandoned.<p>With all of that said, browser exploits are painfully common. If you\nreread tptacek original comment:<p>> <i>Because pretty much all the browsers, on a better-than-quarterly\nbasis, fall victim to attacks that allow arbitrary web pages to upload\ncode into their processes and run it.  Just not sure this needed the\n""attack class"" name.</i><p>you can see browser exploits happens regularly enough to cause\nsignificant damages, but even mentioning the underlying problems results\nin, ""You're trolling...  Internet-as-we-know-it... no shit."" and\nsimilar. It doesn't need to be that way, but around here, it almost\nalways happens. The very idea of finding something better than the\nstatus quo of javascript and endless browser exploits is far too\nintimidating and unreasonable for most people. If you make your living\nfrom javascript or you're just a casual user, it is terrifying to think\nwhat would happen if it suddenly stopped working at 3pm tomorrow. When\nan idea contrary to the status quo is voiced, many people succumb to the\nirrational thinking of a sudden change and the associated irrational\nfears.  But...<p><pre><code>  The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable\n  man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore,\n  all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\n  -- George Bernard Shaw\n</code></pre>\nBeing unreasonable is never a license to troll; the efforts and\ninvestments of others have value and should be respected, but making\nimprovements should remain open for discussion.  Maybe I am\nunreasonable, but I do have good reason for it; our status quo is\nrepeatedly broken. Taking offense to reality will simply prevent you\nfrom improving the situation, and worse, shouting-down others for\nventuring where you fear to tread may prevent them from improving the\nstatus quo for you.<p>If you can't talk about a problem, then you have a bigger problem.",1306717660

Complaining that wikipedia isn't an indiscriminate collection of information is like complaining that Target isn't a fine lobster restaurant -- it was never intended to be and it's fine the way it is. There's enough ""inclusionists"" out there that I'm sure they can build a parallel encyclopaedia with a slightly different philosophy, and if (as I suspect is true) it turns out to be swamped with useless and unverifiable information (not to mention a huge number of vanity pages) then at least we'll know.<p>However:<p><i>[it] will discard ‘notability’ and other ‘encyclopedic’ standards in favor of ‘true and useful’</i><p>I'm not sure how ""useful"" differs from ""notable"" and I suspect they're just going to wind up having the same arguments about different words.

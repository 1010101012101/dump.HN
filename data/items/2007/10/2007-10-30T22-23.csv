74409,comment,74355,74399,0,0,uuilly,,,"It is a universal Gui API.  So on OS X it api's to carbon (soon to be cocoa.)  On windows it api's to mfc and on linux to xwin.  So yes, it has exactly the same look and feel as a mac app or whatever platform you choose build on.  Once it's compiled it's just a bunch of native system gui calls so there is no way to tell the difference.  You've probably used Qt a million times and not known it.  Opera and Google Earth are both Qt apps.  <p>Even if I was only releasing on one platform I would still use it b/c it is so simple and powerful.  And what's the harm in having your app available to the other 90% of computer users?

74405,comment,74076,74192,0,0,davidw,,,"Well... it's a bit easier, but more than anything, it makes it easier in the sense of not screwing it up.  It's not made for massive <i>calculation</i> applications though, like some of the more Fortran/C/C++ oriented things like MPI.  It's oriented more towards fault tollerance - using multiple computers simply because they won't all fail / be offline in the same moment.",1193784077

74403,comment,73674,74029,0,0,sbraford,,,"brk - yup, there very well indeed may be  more factors to consider.<p>I'm with several other posters on this one:<p>- 2% + a modest first-developer salary is totally reasonable (some would even consider 2% high here)<p>- 2% + $0 is a fool's bargain indeed<p>Any remotely successful entrepreneur could scrape up at the very least $5-10k to get a prototype working.  These potential co-founders sound more like guys with an idea who just want someone to develop it for them (do much of the hard work), while paying / cutting in equity wise very little.<p>These guys don't sound like they can be bargained with, but the developer could ask for $200k in cash compensation if/when the startup gets funded.  (doubtful they'd go for this)",1193783635

74394,comment,73854,73854,0,0,ratsbane,,,"That's consistent with my experiences.  As several commentators mentioned, I think it's such a problem because decisions about enterprise software in big organizations are typically made by people who don't understand software, design, or information architecture.  Smaller companies are much more responsive.  It is a mistake (which I've made more than once) to assume that a large organization will make reasonable decisions.<p>It used to be that a successful business started with expertise in how to make widgets or rent cars or something and then tried to figure out information management.  The new trend is for people who understand information management to start from there and get into some other business. Old-school businesses, even capital-intensive ones, which remain clueless are gradually becoming more irrelevant as newer information-savvy startups intrude on their turf.<p>And that is rather interesting.

74389,comment,73850,74365,0,0,wastedbrains,,,"Yeah I guess we can look at redoing some of our CSS as fluid to allow for more compact views on smaller screens. We avoided it for now as our graphic designer said it was more complicated and we would likely face more cross browser compatibility issues. After nailing down pretty much the whole UI, it is probably worth investing the time at that point for scaling CSS.",1193781810

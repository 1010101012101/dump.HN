9291755,comment,9290697,9291167,0,0,strlen,,,"Few things:<p>Google and Facebook have offices in New York (in the case of Facebook, there&#x27;s a team available for most any engineering role in the NY office; I can&#x27;t speak for Google, but I believe Spanner is out of the NY office), so for folks who really want a city lifestyle, this is always an option.<p>As for Bay Area, the big issue are schools: San Francisco schools operate on a lottery system (with the exception of a single &quot;test school&quot;, Lowell), whereas South Bay has excellent public schools available to all those who live within their district boundaries (Cupertino School District, Los-Gatos/Saratoga School District, Los Altos SD, several schools in Fremont area, etc...). So for many, a South Bay location is actually a perk: commuting from South Bay to SF on Caltrain is a major hassle (that is assuming the offices of the company are located to close to Caltrain -- public transportation within SF proper is a nightmare unless you work and live close to BART station) and leaves no time to pick kids up from school/drop them off at school/curricular activities.<p>I should add that at least Google and Facebook run buses within suburban South Bay as well -- so the worst part of the commute (going North on 101 in the morning, South on 101 in the evening) can be avoided.<p>I should add there are also people living further in various bedroom communities in East Bay like Albany or Walnut Creek, or San Ramon (which also have good schools) and most of those folks either work for SF-based companies (keep in mind Google does have an SF office as well), or make use of company busses (Google runs busses to SF), or work from home some days a week.<p>This would also be a huge generalization, but one can also think of the Bay Area as the OSI stack: application/presentation in SF, mid-tier (databases at Oracle,  distributed infrastructure at Google and FB) in Peninsula/Northern parts of South Bay, and physical layer (Apple, Cisco, Juniper, Intel, etc...) in Sunnyvale and further south. So for companies that do more systems-level development, there&#x27;s both network effects (they&#x27;re hiring people coming from other companies in the area), and the need to somewhat more experienced engineers (who are more likely to have families and to own vs. rent).<p>(background: lived in South Bay Area since I was 13, worked as an engineer in various South Bay Area software/Internet companies -- both in office parks as well as offices in more walkable downtown areas -- since late teens, including at Facebook in the Menlo Park campus).",1427741991

9291744,comment,9290289,9291676,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> The question is, is it lawful?<p>Apparently yes.<p>> It&#x27;s appropriate for the court to express disgust when the law leads to blatantly bad outcomes.<p>Then they should find different jobs. The law working &#x27;bad&#x27; happens quite frequently and I have yet to see such a blatant preference for one side over the other in official court documents.<p>It degrades the court.<p>The homehowner is not &#x27;stealing the home&#x27;, the homeowner has found a legal loophole in a situation that could have turned against them quite easily and the court had to confirm that the loophole is <i>indeed</i> legal. Liking or disliking doesn&#x27;t enter into it. The bank probably had ample opportunity to avoid this happening but in the end trusted too much in the judge siding with them because of the fundamental unreasonableness of the request, forgetting that it was the legality that mattered.<p>If it there is any doubt about this being legal then you can be sure the case will be appealed.<p>Contractual law is usually dealt with quite strictly when the tables are turned, for once it is the homeowner that ends up with an advantage, it&#x27;s a foregone conclusion that future contracts will be re-written to rule this possibility out so the damage is limited and that the bank(s) will be much more careful about letting things get even close to the statute of limitations.<p>I wonder how many homeowners are in a position to continue to exploit this given the fact that the banks are now warned.",1427741931

And if/when they do arrive it&#x27;s almost inevitable that they&#x27;ll make driving more attractive, not less.<p>The problem is that you can approach self driving cars in an incremental way, while light rail is extremely expensive upfront.<p>I don&#x27;t have time at the moment to go into detail, but look at the Greenlight Proposal in Pinellas County (Florida).

9291726,comment,9271136,9274430,0,0,derf_,,,"Well, one has to be careful here. In a static portion of a scene, a consistent error likely to look much better than an error that flips between being too large and too small in alternate frames, since the latter will show up as noise or flicker that was not in the original. That can be more objectionable than simply being slightly wrong. Notably none of the metrics we use for evaluating Daala have any means of measuring this.<p>The better approach, I think, is some form of &quot;temporal RDO&quot;, where you spend more bits on places that will be good <i>predictors</i> of future frames. We discussed the idea in a Theora update in 2010 [0]. x264 implemented it even before then (under the name &quot;mbtree&quot; [1]). It is not yet implemented in Daala, as we do not have two-pass rate control or lookahead yet. It&#x27;s possible to do one-pass, no-lookahead versions by estimating future prediction efficiency based on the past, but you want one with full lookahead to compare against to make sure those estimates are doing the right thing.<p>I am not sure temporal RDO would save us here, because the issues described only occur in areas of the frame that are being updated. It still might have, in this case---these things are relative---but we could construct cases where it would fail to do so.<p>[0] <a href=""https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/theora/demo9.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.x264.nl/developers/Dark_Shikari/MBtree%20paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.x264.nl/developers/Dark_Shikari/MBtree%20paper.pd...</a>",1427741827

Of 1.5m total people, only about 500k live in the city, and the other 1m live in the suburbs, which spread out to a surprisingly large radius considering that it&#x27;s not that large of a population (the outer suburbs are about 40-50km from downtown).<p>However that quite geographically large sprawl is <i>mostly</i> channeled along five main corridors [1], with a fairly fast commuter-rail system serving as the backbone of each corridor.

Kids often have lots of accessories that you don&#x27;t want to be dragging around with you everywhere (stroller, diaper bag, toys, books,  etc).  A car is a great place to store those.  Kids also result in more multi-stop trips that aren&#x27;t necessarily on the Metro lines.<p>I think millennials probably won&#x27;t adopt their parents&#x27; car-based solutions to these problems, but what they do choose will be different than what they&#x27;re choosing now.",1427741069

Is that worth the overhead?&quot; and the answer is almost always no.  Ie: is local optimization worth the overhead?<p>Local optimization is extremely tempting no matter who you are, where you are.  It&#x27;s always easy to reach a point of frustration and come to the line of reasoning of &quot;I don&#x27;t get why we are wasting so much time to ship this product using the &#x27;old&#x27; stuff when we could just use &#x27;newstuff&#x27; and get it out the door in the next week.&quot;  This happens to engineers of all levels, especially in a continuous deployment, &quot;Just Ship&quot; culture.  The point of the article is that local optimization gives you this tiny boost in the beginning for a long term cost that eventually moves the organization is a direction of shipping less.  It&#x27;s not that innovative technologies are bad.<p>> But if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you choose good technologies<p>No, if you know what you are doing you make good organizational decisions.  It matters less what technology you use than that the entire organization uses the same technology.  Etsy has a great engineering team and yet the entire site is written in PHP.  I don&#x27;t think there is a single engineer working at Etsy who thinks PHP is the best language out there, but the decision to be made at the time was &quot;there is a site using PHP, some Python, some Ruby etc., how do we make this easier to work on?&quot;  Of those three python and ruby are almost universally thought of as better languages than PHP, but in this case the correct decision was picking a worse technology because more of the site was written in it, the existing infrastructure supported it more completely and so as an organization and a business we could get back to shipping products more quickly by all agreeing to use PHP.  Etsy certainly does not think of its engineers as monkeys, quite the opposite.",1427741049

Those, in turn, fudged their accounting to make re-sales to the tertiary market more palatable.  The tertiary market just leveraged the hell out of those repackaged mortgages, and sometimes just made up numbers to fill in the blanks.<p>Then that first guy that got a mortgage loan with no actual income missed a payment.  That increasing leverage all the way up turned that little blip into an explosion.  Mortgage businesses hit the ground or hit the brakes, and now fewer new buyers could afford homes without loans.

9291574,comment,9290697,9290697,0,0,radicaledward,,,">> Researchers say they’re intrigued that millennials’ aversion to driving and owning a car has endured even since the recession ended.<p>This is a direct response to the above quote.<p>Every time I read one of these articles I&#x27;m surprised that the rise of smart phones isn&#x27;t cited as a contributor to this change of preference. Every minute I&#x27;m driving is a minute that I am disconnected from the internet. Constant connection is arguably a bad thing, but I&#x27;m pretty much addicted, and I would bet that everyone else is too.<p>Of course there are many other contributing factors to my preference for mass transit over driving. My perceptions that inform my preference (whether true or not):<p>* Cars are simply not safe. It isn&#x27;t just that I&#x27;m worried about getting hurt in an accident. I don&#x27;t want to be responsible for harming someone else.\n* Many forms of media have constantly reminded me as I grow up that cars are bad for the environment.\n* Cars are incredibly expensive. If I never buy another car, I could easily afford a small house with the money I will save over my lifetime. In addition to the car, I have to pay for gas, insurance, and maintenance.<p>However, in the end, I still have a car. I have a car because my city&#x27;s public transit is still slow and unreliable. It is getting better. And I use it quite a lot to get to things in the interior of the city. My car gets me to the events I go to on the edge of town, and it covers me when I need to get somewhere in the middle of the night, when the bus isn&#x27;t running.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how similar I am to other millenials, but these are the things I think about when I see a quote like that.",1427740606

I find the idea of millennials not driving simply due to aspiration sets a little nauseating, as depending on how you&#x27;re slicing the age cut off, I&#x27;m part of &quot;this generation&quot;.<p>Owning a car is very expensive and out of reach of fair number of people. Even driving a modest economy car, between parking ($150 monthly downtown in my city) , my car loan ($200 mo.) and good insurance ($200ish mo.) + gas ($60ish) means I&#x27;m out $600+ of income. That&#x27;s $7200 yearly without maintenance.  That&#x27;s as much as many people&#x27;s rent in many places. I&#x27;m privileged enough that I can afford this without seriously impacting my lifestyle, and I have a sinking suspicion that if more millennials could, they&#x27;d also be car owners/drivers. With the average income per person, at $26,000, owning car is nearly out of reach.<p>However, I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t look the gift horse in the mouth. Giving more mass transit options for work is certainly a good thing.",1427740583

9291568,comment,9289409,9289409,0,0,Metapilot,,,"I think the author&#x27;s perspective is skewed in order to stay in line with the title.  Here&#x27;s an example of why I say that:<p>The author states that &quot;For some 90% of searches, a modern search engine analyzes and learns from past queries, rather than searching the Web itself, to deliver the most relevant results.&quot; This may be true in some types of searches but overall, I think the statement is misleading.<p>Rather, it&#x27;s better to think of it like this:\nOne important part of the algorithmic process involves constantly crawling the web and updating the index with new information. (Important / frequently-updated web sites may get crawled all day every day, while ones that are less important may get crawled only weekly or monthly). Meanwhile, another part of the algorithmic process constantly analyzes new info discovered in the crawl and combines it with, as the author-mentioned, click-through data learned from past queries.<p>The answers to many queries don&#x27;t change, while the answers to many other queries deserve freshness.  For example, I&#x27;m quite certain Einstein&#x27;s date of birth hasn&#x27;t changed in quite a while, but his theory of relativity is in constant discussion and there is always new information and new queries pertaining to it.  As a result, there is not much need for a search engine to go digging for the latest info on an &quot;einstein&#x27;s birthday&quot; query, but it&#x27;s to everyone&#x27;s advantage that Google is able to identify which pages on the web deserve priority crawling and that Google has retrieved and incorporated the fresh info those pages contain into its index when it comes to a topical type of query like &quot;diffraction of light with quantum physics&quot;.<p>In the end, the results to every query depend on info gathered from the web and user data helps refine the results. Info that is more static can be prioritized with more input from click-through data, while new information found on the web must rely more on Google&#x27;s artificial intelligence to push it up in front of searchers.<p>Another reason that that &quot;90%&quot; statement sticks out to me is that there is a fairly often-used factoid tossed around industry experts that between &quot;6% to 20% of queries that get asked every day have never been asked before.&quot; Google can&#x27;t rely heavily on past query data for all of these type of searches.",1427740556

Many of these short sellers that were depending on ticket price dropping ended up having to refund the tickets they short sold at 2x or 3x the original purchase price.

A lot of new tech solves existing problems, while re-surfacing problems that the old tech solved.  Everyone thinks it&#x27;s great until they&#x27;ve used it for a bit longer, and run into those issues.\n- New tech runs a higher risk of disappearing/becoming unsupported.  If you plan to support your product for a long time, that&#x27;s a valid risk factor.<p>For myself, I&#x27;m wary of having very new tech as a fundamental underpinning of any piece of work I need to stick around.  I&#x27;ll likely adopt frameworks or database systems cautiously, unless their superiority is overwhelmingly obvious.  On the other hand, I&#x27;d be a lot more willing to take risks on a simple library.<p>With a smaller, simpler piece of tech, it&#x27;s easier to replace if something goes awry, and it&#x27;s easier to evaluate in its totality prior to taking the risk.",1427739999

That was a very simple system, pay someone for clickstream data, extract trending queries, front those with AdWord buys to get your page on the top of Google&#x27;s results, and profit.<p>Having built a search engine and run it for 5 years, we got to see what people felt was relevant and what wasn&#x27;t in a very loose way with click stream data. Basically you have a query and 10 blue links you can split the results in quartiles and figure out if the thing they clicked on was top half, bottom half, top quarter/second quarter etc. And do A/B testing to see how that played out. But what we found was that the best indication of what a page was about, was the text that linked to it. If you have an in-link to a page which was &quot;<href=&#x27;page&#x27;>great radio site&quot;[1] then &quot;great radio site&quot; would be a query that should return that page which might be titled something like &quot;bob&#x27;s electromagnetic spectrum imaginarium&quot; or something equally unlikely to come up in a query string.<p>So the bottom line is that there are lots of ways to try to determine relevance, click stream data is a part of that but by no means the biggest factor.<p>[1] neutered html for obvious reasons.",1427739973

We are passionate gamers and want to create a cheaper and simpler alternative for playing VR games than Oculus. We are developing a mobile app that uses a smartphone to create virtual reality experience.\nThe app connects to our PC server that takes the game picture, renders the image into stereoscopic 3D and streams it to your smartphone. You need a cheap, plastic headset to put the phone in and you can play games in virtual reality. You can also use Google Cardbord if you want to try VR without breaking the bank. Your smartphone has build-in accelerometer and gyroscope sensors which the app uses to track your head movements. The app works with any PC game without any modifications to the game needed. We currently have a beta version that you can test. It&#x27;s an Android app, but an iOS version is coming very soon as well: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intugame.vr&hl=en .\nWe have lots of work to do to improve the app&#x27;s performance. That&#x27;s way we&#x27;ve launched an Indiegogo campaign. You can check it out for more information: http://igg.me/at/intugame",1427739644

But it&#x27;s actually really hard to measure engagement with digital ads since the vast majority of digital ads are display ads.<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s no real metric that can determine whether or not a user even looked at an ad: yes, the ad was loaded by the user&#x27;s browser, but the user may not have scrolled down the page far enough to actually see the ad, or if they simply scrolled past it without actually looking at it. Because there is no good way to measure engagement, advertisers tend to create ads that promote being noticed over user engagement. Publishers have reacted by loading ads in different ways (e.g. multiple page articles, progressive page loading, etc.) to support higher ad rates on premium content.<p>There was a recent trend in last few years that showed mobile ads had higher engagement levels, though many in the industry now think that a substantial portion of this is due to &quot;mis-clicks&quot; on mobile ads. The trend is moving away from click-throughs as a measure of engagement as a result of unscrupulous publishers building sites that make it reeeeeally easy to mis-click on an ad. Regardless, measurement is a huge problem in the digital space when it comes to engagement; though the trends relating to engagement on a per-ad basis are almost certainly declining simply due to the increase in quantity of ad inventory and the reduction in transactional friction involved in advertising over the last 10 years.",1427739356

(Erlang did what node does but much better, and MongoDB is poorly engineered global write lock mess that is probably better now but whose hype way exceeded its quality for many years.)<p>The engineers are monkey&#x27;s idea is that engineers can&#x27;t tell the difference-- and it seems to be supported by the popularity of those two technologies.<p>But if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you choose good technologies-- Elixir is less than a year old but its built on the boring 20 years of work that has been done in Erlang.  Couchbase is very innovative but it&#x27;s built on nearly a decade of couchdb and memcache work.<p>You choose the right technologies and they become silver bullets that really make your project much more productive.<p>Boring technologies often have a performance (in time to market terms) cost to them.<p>Really you can&#x27;t apply rules of thumb like this and the &quot;innovation tokens&quot; idea is silly.<p>I say this having done a product in 6 months with 4 people that should have taken 12 people 12 months to do, using Elixir (not even close to 1.0 of elixir even) and couchbase and trying out some of my &quot;wacky&quot; ideas for how a web platform should be built-- yes, I was using cutting edge new ideas in this thing that we took to production very quickly.<p>The difference?<p>Those four engineers were all good.  Not all experienced-- one had been programming less than a year-- but all good.<p>Seems everyone talks about finding good talent and how important that is but they don&#x27;t seem to be able to do it. I don&#x27;t know.<p>I do know is, don&#x27;t use &quot;engineers are monkies&quot; rules of thumb-- just hire human engineers.",1427739072

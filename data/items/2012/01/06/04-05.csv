I occassionally get emails from idiot recruiters who think that secrecy is the best way to go and won't tell me which companies they are representing but want to get me on the phone 'just for a few minutes' to talk about these amazing opportunities. I usually give them one more chance and email them to explain that its important for me to research potential employers before spending time on any sort of application process and that I would need the company info to go any further. If they don't comply, I blacklist any further communication from them.<p>Basically, you need to know what a company is all about before wasting any time, once you have at least the name of the company, go to their website, read any reviews you can find from past employees, etc, 'google map' their offices to see if its a dump or if it looks like a viable place of employment. There's no shame in blacklisting communication from people who are wasting your time, I now make it a regular part of sorting through the emails I get regarding 'opportunities'",1325825931

3432029,comment,3431434,3431434,4,0,kurtvarner,,,"This question can be highly debated, but here's my take...<p>Yes, alternative TLDs are cool for us nerds, but it's horrible for any startup in the consumer internet space. Most ""regular"" people are not familiar or comfortable using them. More often than not, people will meet you with a blank stare when you tell them your website is example.io.<p>I once spoke with the founders of Vol.ly (since acquired) and they said their name choice was a nightmare. Their company was pronounced Volly, but every time they would have to take time to explain their domain was v-o-l dot l-y. This is annoying for the founders and instantly forgotten by the user.<p>There's a reason why most startups that begin with non-.com domains eventually switch if they gain enough traction.<p>All that being said, I don't think it's logical to purchase an expensive .com before your company proves its success (or raises an absurd amount of money). Take your time, and get creative to find a workable .com, or get a domain that will still make sense if you ever want to purchase the .com. For example, served.io (no disrespect to them) could never change to servedio.com.<p>However, if your not in the consumer space, then I think alternative TLDs are a much more viable option. You're not depending on eyeballs for your startup's success. And if your target market is technology folk, it's even better.",1325825835

(Bernoulli first proponed that a persons willingness to gamble a certain amount of money was a product of how that amount related to his overall wealththat is, $1 million means more to a millionaire than it does to a billionaire.)""<p>But in the lecture, Kahneman stated no qualms with utility theory. Rather, he pointed to the application of the theory, where Bernoulli had assumed a gain of $1 million is equivalent to $1 million appearing in their bank account, with the mechanism being irrelevant. That is what prospect theory (and the associated question) debunks.",1325825770
3432026,comment,3431616,3431884,8,0,rayiner,,,"That's kind of the whole point of the research. Neoclassical economics assumes certain things about peoples' utility functions that aren't true. For example, even though you can ascribe utility to going on a date, there should be no difference between not going on a date at all and having to cancel a date you had expected to go on. Obviously people don't view things that way. Or, to use another example from Kahneman's work, getting a $5,000 raise out of the blue is perceived as very different than getting a $5,000 raise after your boss had told you to expect a $10,000 raise. Or, for that matter, after your coworker got a $10,000 raise.<p>From the standpoint of neoclassical economics, these outcomes should be the same, but clearly they're not. Delving into the psychology of the rational actor in this way is a pretty fundamental change in economics.",1325825755

3432010,comment,3431107,3431107,22,0,agentultra,,,"This is <i>still</i> a terrible problem. It's simple exactly because it is familiar to the interviewer. It's easy for them to believe that anyone with half a brain should be able to answer it because they've practiced it a hundred times and have forgotten exactly what it is like to not know the answer.<p>I think coding problems are terrible for almost any interview because the candidate is going to be struggling to find the right answer that will please you. They're looking to avoid causing you to press the big red button that gives them the electric shock and sends them home feeling like they're the most stupid person on Earth for not solving the easiest algorithm problem known to human kind.<p>I get it though: as people who have to interview potential hires it gets tedious wading through the muck. Personally I don't understand how you can interview someone for a senior position without reviewing their prior work. I also find it rather insulting to assume that we should just separate them from the wheat just like all the other chaff. It's just disrespectful IMO.<p>I'd done a lot of interviews about a year ago. All but one of them used a programming test of some sort. From fizzbuzz to fibonacci to splitting words, finding palindromes and implementing FIFO queues. I did it all. Some of them I got right. Some I didn't. Even the ones I had practiced and came to know really well... sometimes even then I would blow it. It was a really disheartening experience and I almost gave up programming forever when I started to believe that rigmarole about how any programmer worth their salt should be able to solve these problems without thinking about it.<p>Which got me to thinking. I can solve these problems easily. I've got my algorithms books, I practice code kata, and I can generally golf some problems off the top of my head and they'll often compile. Why can't I do this in front of other people?<p>The psychology of the situation is what gets in the way. If you give a candidate a problem they're going to immediately begin to think about what you want them to say. You say it's not trivia, but that's the exact mental process that will happen in most people. Given such a problem I'm certain a good number of candidates I interview would be able to solve them on their own. They might even be able to white board them once we start working together and they get to know me. But while we're in the interview room I'm the gatekeeper with the big red button and they've doing everything they can to keep me from pressing it. That doesn't work for me because I know that's not what I want from them.<p>When I hire someone I look for initiative, experience, and intuition. I look for people who have taken what they've been given and made something more for themselves. If at their last job they weren't happy with something I'll ask what they did to change it. I also like to test their experience. I ask design-type questions, ask them what they like about their tools, what they don't like, patterns they've seen, how they practice... things like that. And finally with intuition I like to throw up some source code of some problem I'm working on or interesting ones I've come across (and solved) in the past and discuss it with them. I give them an over view of the code, my expectations of it, and then ask them to read it. We walk through it and I get to see how well they can spot bugs, code smell, what they focus on when they see code. IMO, these are the sort of things that I think demonstrate a person's knowledge of programming.<p>And from my experience I think it's a better way to find good candidates.",1325825418

3432006,comment,3430100,3430100,5,0,benburkert,,,"AFAIK there's no way to initiate TLS over a SPDY stream (i guess SPDY could be extended to add TLS handshake control frames, but that's downright crazy) which would mean that the third diagram is misleading. End to end SSL would not be possible with a SPDY proxy. Instead, the client's SSL connection would extend to the SPDY proxy, and the proxy would have it's own SSL (HTTP, HTTPS or SPDY) connection to the remote server. If that's the case, the proxy would have unencrypted access to all traffic.<p>This is arguably not a problem for clients that explicitly opt in for this sort of proxy setup. But it sounds like this is not the case for the Kindle Fire. Based on this article (i don't have a Kindle Fire to test this theory), i'm guessing the browser has custom CA's for the SPDY proxy so that the SPDY proxy can spoof any domain through the magic of SNI. If all this is true, then it's pretty evil. People who know enough to check for the ""secure connection"" badge in the browser would be fooled into thinking they have end to end encryption to the website they are viewing. In reality, the proxy, and whoever runs it, silently has complete access to your unecrypted traffic.<p>There's quite a few assumptions here. And I'm not a SPDY expert so I may be overlooking something. But this doesn't sound like an optimization i'd be comfortable with.",1325825295

3431980,comment,3431132,3431132,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"GAE is a mistake. By that I mean that it's got a big design flaw that's bound to cost Google money, which means it'll always be expensive than alternatives. Consider shared PHP hosting: a request comes in, apache finds which PHP file is responsible for it, then directs the request to the PHP interpreter. The PHP interpreter will parse the file (or more likely load the parsed bytecode from a cache) and return a response, which apache will then forward to the user agent. Notice that aside from the cache the PHP interpreter is stateless. As soon as it is done serving a request from site foo.com it can immediately jump on a request from bar.com and the context switch doesn't cost anything (once again disregarding finite cache size issues).<p>Contrast this with running a stand-alone application server for each site, which is what GAE does. Here, even if your code is not serving any requests it's still waiting to get them. Now, GAE has powerful magic in it to retire request handlers which aren't frequently used. This way if site foo.com is getting 1 request/minute, it only really needs one process/thread/hander abstraction at a time. However, it is expensive to start/stop these ""processes"", so instead GAE is forced to keep this ""process"" around for a while after a request has been served hoping that the cost of keeping it alive would be justified by a second request. Thus these stateful, slow-to-start processes are always taking up resources that could be used to serve other requests.<p>Disclaimer: all my knowledge of GAE has been from reading their docs/blog, not from deploying projects to it.<p>Disclaimer 2: I am not saying that PHP is better/worse than GAE in any way. However, I am saying that the model that GAE uses is more costly for a typical application. This can be easily seen by comparing the cost of running a basic site on GAE vs $2/month shared hosting.",1325824354

I can mock the Request and Response object.<p>We do have integration-tests that test specifically component that interact with databases. But there are another set of unit-tests that test the business/process workflow and assume the database will return something relevant. We do this because we want to write many tests with focus specifically to business/process workflow related code, not the database layer.<p>This way we can write more tests without paying the taxes of: performance and setup (when you have a huge database models, it's not fun to prepare the models for each-single-unit-test that has to touch the database even though the purpose of that unit-test is not to test the database).<p>So far this model has worked well for us (i.e.: no more excuses that build takes too long or writing unit-tests take too long due to the setup both infrastructure and preparing huge model).",1325822991

I apologize if it appeared that way to you, it was not my intent. I am really passionate about this subject, because I was one of the worst offenders with testing people and was taught how to not do it and still be able to identify quality candidates. I can tend to get exited about the subject because it was such a wow moment when the revelation struck me.<p>More specific to your answers I understand your position, and I truly believe that you use it in this manner, the problem I have is that for every one of you there are 20 of the former me's who get so wound up in code tricks and trivia that we create unfair and useless interview filters. As such there is a perception among developers about code test, and that perception can be summed up that I am going to be tested on what the company thinks I should know, not what I know. For some of us, this creates a horrible and humiliating interview experience. In which a developer stands in front of a whiteboard analyzing their every move. No matter how much someone reassures them, they still have everything but logic running through their mind. It only takes one interviewer with an ego to permanently affect a developer in this manner and no amount of reassurance from a person they just met will help someone believe that their every move is not being judged.<p>Many people with Asperger syndrome fail tech interviews horribly but a good deal of them turn out to be wonderful developers. My best friend is affected by it, and I know from experience that he would never land a job if it where not for me. In spite of that, he is always the star developer at every organization that I bring him into. Now if someone sat him down and said, show me something you built and walk me through a routine, like the article suggest, they would be fascinated by his depth of knowledge.",1325822894

At school we did a project once where we built a GTK app for creating logins on linux. There's many things you get to deal with like file handling and executing commands from code and so on.<p>One fun thing for learning hacking is trying to implement linux commands such as ls or ps. You get a little more intimate knowledge about the OS and you don't have to come up with specs because you already know what it's supposed to do :)",1307689155

I was only taking three classes  (French, English Comp, and Music) and ended up only paying attention in French class.  Came in handy when I decided to go to Paris that summer.<p>Some years later I read Soul of a New Machine, got excited about studying EE, and managed a partial scholarship to NYIT.<p>I cared about <i>passing</i>, and cared about learning (most) stuff, so I mostly got good grades.  Switching from EE to CS helped. :)<p>My enthusiasm sort of petered put after a while, I started  lowering my course load (school + work was getting hard), then dropped out for bit then went back, but nine years later I graduated with honors and an award from the the English department.<p>I had wicked great English profs, and a few really good CS teachers.  Most of the time teachers would let me slide on assignments if I otherwise demonstrated understanding and the ability to apply what I knew.  So I had some fun. Had one math prof who gave me a C even though I swear I never got more than 30 on any test.  But I was the only one in class who asked intelligent questions and could make useful observations.  (Thanks, Dr. Vitale!) Sadly, I sucked on the tests.<p>Did the grades matter later in life?  I doubt it.  I think all that mattered was that I had a degree.  Might be wrong, you never really know, but I don't recall too many people being impressed.  Once you get a job all people care about is what you're doing right then and there, not some college grade.<p>Overall I think you should learn as much as you can for its own sake, which often leads to good grades anyway.",1307688507

Website that allows you to enter your phonenumber, and sends an installation URL via SMS. Just a few clicks on the phone side, very simple. For example Google uses this. <<a href=""http://www.google.com/mobile/maps/&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/mobile/maps/&#62</a>;<p>2. Enter the short mobile optimized URL in the phone.

So if anything says more than 7926 (plus maybe the height of a mountain or whatever), it's not calculating a straight line in Cartesian 3d space.<p>Second, that distance of 7926 miles would be from a point to its antipode.  Iowa is not antipodal to Egypt, not even close.  The antipode of Iowa is in the Indian Ocean and hundreds of miles from any land.

Admeld's RTB platform is possibly second in size to Google AdX/GDN. Rolling up all their publishers under the same platform means even more inventory that Google can control.<p>This is consolidation in the traditional sense- Google is trying to commoditize display inventory and end up as the monopoly provider of display inventory. Interestingly enough, Yahoo! sells a boatload of inventory through Admeld... I'm curious to see what changes in that relationship, and if Yahoo! really is going for more of a content strategy while Google goes for the advertising tech play.<p>While it was a pretty dumb comment and off topic, the top comment on the TC article got the gist of it: ""this is why android is still laggy and fragmented, because google cares about ads more than software quality.""",1307685916

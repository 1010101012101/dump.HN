7727812,comment,7726615,7727740,4,0,saurik,,,"I feel like you ignored the brunt of my argument and demonstration for my statements, and instead are just arguing with a soundbite from my comment. I will try again, maybe more explicitly: bandwidth is actually very much like electricity because both have a peak capacity, a noticeable cost of equipment maintenance, but very little incremental cost; you don&#x27;t experience a blackout or a brownout because you ran out of coal: maybe that will happen in the distant future, but today the problem will be that the immediate amount of power needed by the users exceeded the maximum capacity of either the plant burning coal (which likely has lots of coal in reach that it can&#x27;t burn fast enough) or at best the rate at which you can remove it from a mine to get it to the plant.<p>Now, if you could somehow cheaply lay cable and setup cell towers constantly and everywhere, and if they didn&#x27;t degrade or get obsoleted by new standards, sure: maybe you could keep building out infrastructure and accumulate capacity to handle increasing usage forever. But finding places to put cell towers is hard, laying new cable is destructive, and the reality is that you have to maintain and upgrade your infrastructure constantly. The peak load that can be supported is thereby a key cost, and there should be incentives for everyone to keep that cost low.<p>As for your &quot;peak usage is contributed to by everyone equally&quot; assertion, I just don&#x27;t understand why this is not clear: if the Superbowl being streamed is the highest usage load, then if you are watching the Superbowl (or doing something else equally bandwidth intensive <i>at that exact moment</i>) you contributed to the max total peak usage for the month in a way that someone who wasn&#x27;t using the Internet that day did not. I just don&#x27;t see how you can argue against that: it seems self-evident :(. Some people are simply going to be using more bandwidth than other people during the peaks (and some services are going to encourage people to use lots of bandwidth, especially simultaneously, while others do not.)<p>To put this another way, you are saying that my grandmother sending a few emails every month is contributing to peak usage as much as someone who streamed the Superbowl... or that someone who only uses Netflix at 3am (or whatever the most non-peak time happens to be) is also contributing to peak usage as much as someone who streamed the Superbowl... at some point this argument becomes gratuitously preposterous. If everyone were my grandmother then the world would need fundamentally less networking infrastructure to keep up with demand: she should not have to bear the cost of people who insist on streaming the Superbowl live over the Internet.<p>And again, with the concept of &quot;wasteful&quot;, this should also be really obvious: let&#x27;s say the there are two ways to steam the Superbowl--two codecs that could be used to compress the stream--and one uses half as much bandwidth as the other. This one decision affects peak usage more than any other decision: someone somewhere has to bear the price of this decision, and to make the wrong choice is &quot;wasteful&quot;. If someone insists on using the worse codec (or in a network neutral &quot;bill the users&quot; model, chooses to use services that employ the worse codec), they should somehow be forced to bear the infrastructure buildout and upkeep cost of that decision.<p>Maybe you could work this out with some math: can you demonstrate how all these different kinds of users are contributing equally to the peak load? You seem to believe that this should be as obvious to me as I think this should be to you. Whether you measure a ratio of the peak or the probability of increasing the peak or even metrics that are purposely flawed in an attempt to force equality, like &quot;whether the user was using any bandwidth at all during the peak&quot;, any and all analyses show that the person watching the Superbowl streaming in this example are contributing to the peak <i>much</i> more than my grandmother is, <i>much</i> more than someone watching Netflix in the middle of the night is, and even more than someone using a &quot;less wasteful&quot; codec to perform the same activity is... please show me what metric you are using where these people ally work out to &quot;contribute equally&quot;.",1399784013

7727804,comment,7725732,7727519,8,0,mpyne,,,"> no one seems to have ever seriously asked &quot;why do these people want to kill us&quot;.<p>Plenty of people have asked that question. That the answer isn&#x27;t what you expect doesn&#x27;t mean the question wasn&#x27;t asked.<p>It turns out that the goal is to establish (or rather, re-establish) the Caliphate, or at least some twisted takfiri version of it.<p>In order to establish the Caliphate you need somewhere to put it -- namely, the Muslim countries of the Middle East.<p>But the countries already have states running the show. In AQ&#x27;s viewpoint, they are &quot;the near enemy&quot;. The near enemies have supporters too, including the U.S. (which was &quot;the far enemy&quot;). Other enemies include the United Nations (both since the UN Charter is incompatible with takfiri Sharia extremism, but also because the UN recognizes Israel), Shi&#x27;a Muslims, etc.<p>In one of the key decision points for OBL post-Gulf War, he decided to focus on the far enemy first instead of the near enemies.<p>At this point, the &quot;crime&quot; of the U.S. wasn&#x27;t drones or bombing brown babies or anything so snide. The U.S.&#x27;s only crime was putting infidel soldiers on Arab soil to evict Iraq from Kuwait, and for maintaining regional stability for what I&#x27;m sure were completely self-serving reasons that provided no benefit whatsoever to the rest of the world.<p>Accordingly AQ attacked the U.S.: The 1993 World Trade Center bombings... the 1995 &quot;Bojinka&quot; airline bombing plots (yes, plural) that was only discovered by accident at the last second by an alert Philippine policewoman... the 1998 embassy bombings... the 2000 attack on USS Cole in Aden, Yemen.<p>The U.S. response was remarkably restrained throughout this entire period. Despite hundreds of Kenyans alone being killed by AQ in the 1998 bombings, the U.S. response was limited to dropping cruise missiles on known AQ training camps in Afghanistan and a chemical production facility in Sudan that showed evidence of working with AQ to produce nerve gas. The evidence was not ironclad, mind, but that was it: No boots on the ground, no roving drone patrols, no NSA massive surveillance efforts.<p>The problem for AQ wasn&#x27;t what the U.S. was doing to the rest of the world by 2000, the problem was that the U.S. wasn&#x27;t doing enough. AQ had somehow failed to get America&#x27;s serious attention, and had failed to evict America completely from the Middle East, so they decided that they had to go bigger. And they did.<p>So while the facile &quot;they hate us for our freedom&quot; line is not the answer, it&#x27;s not far off: They attack because Muslims still live in either approximately free societies, or tyrannies under the wrong dictator (i.e. apostate regimes). There will be no end unless they establish the Caliphate, and even that doesn&#x27;t necessarily represent the end, since the stated goal of this new caliphate by Ayman al-Zawahiri is to extend jihad against the U.S. and the West.<p>If you want to research yourself the motives of the various and many insurgent/terrorist groups out there then there&#x27;s certainly no lack of material, from the very many people who have asked the same question you say has never been asked. I&#x27;d recommend going through some of it. Articles asking (and trying to answer) this question have been published since long before 9/11.

7727796,comment,7727597,7727597,6,0,quotient,,,"I think &quot;board game to teach kids programming&quot; is a misdescription. This is a board game that teaches kids to think like programmers --- it teaches elementary logic skills and makes them familiar with programming concepts. It doesn&#x27;t teach them anything about actual programming, though it makes them better potential programmers. I think this game is worthwhile as a general learning exercise, i.e. to develop structured thinking, but with regard to programming, it is a misdirection of efforts.<p>To elaborate: there&#x27;s a certain magic moment when you write your first program. You realize that you can make the computer <i>do things</i>. First, you just have it print a test message. <i>WOW</i>. Then you have it add two numbers. It works, and you feel a surge of emotion: with this tool, <i>anything</i> is possible. It&#x27;s an incredibly powerful and liberating feeling. It is very persuasive, and often gives rise to an immediate fascination.<p>The way to &quot;teach kids programming&quot; is to give them that experience, to let them feel that Eureka!-moment. Teaching kids about logical statements, loops, etc. is neat stuff, and will certainly make them into better thinkers, but <i>it does not make them (significantly) likelier to open up a REPL and type in &quot;print &#x27;Hello World&#x27;&quot;.</i><p>And that is the critical point: if a parent wants their child to pick up programming, they&#x27;ll have to get them to actually program. Playing games about conditional statements and basic logic is only very tangentially related to getting children to write and run code. (The same complaint goes for other products in this space: picture-books, games, etc. to bring children closer to programming have been released in great number recently.)<p>Perhaps there is some sort of general fear that actually opening up a terminal, notepad, etc. is somehow an intrinsically difficult task (likely because most parents have no idea how it works, either), so parents try to edge closer to programming with these educational toys, but the problem is that &quot;learning to code&quot; is not something that can be done by gradual immersion. A child can learn to swim by dipping their toes into the water and then slowly wading into the pool while moving their arms ---  a couple hours of this, and they&#x27;ll learn to swim. However, with coding, the process is not as gradual: at some point, the child has to open up an editor and start typing. An effective educational tool that &quot;teaches kids programming&quot; really must do only one thing: help them make this step.",1399783442

It&#x27;s extremely easy to identify incidents involving them: Windows 8, GNOME 3, Firefox 4 and later, this new version of Google Maps, and the Slashdot beta website, among others.<p>There are some common traits we see with these cases:<p>1. They hijack an existing, well-established software product.<p>2. They throw out years, if not decades, of accumulated knowledge and experience.<p>3. They usually come in with little to no relevant experience themselves.<p>4. They consider appearance far more important than usability, efficiency or productivity.<p>5. They create a design that&#x27;s obviously flawed in many different ways.<p>6. They refuse to accept or even acknowledge these many flaws in their designs, no matter how loudly long-time users point them out.<p>7. They release their changes into the wild, often forcing them upon users who absolutely abhor the changes.<p>8. Their design efforts drive away more users than they could ever hope to bring in.<p>The fourth and sixth points are the key ones here.

1665555,comment,1664722,1665341,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"It's a reasonable enough way of protecting hosted websites, especially if you're running more than one server. You can monitor multiple logs for abuse from different sources, and then update all servers to drop traffic from those sources. So, if someone runs a WordPress vulnerability scan on a hosted website, you can detect that and immediately refuse any mail/ssh/dns/www/ftp/other service from that IP.<p>It requires a little bit of kludging to do this though. :-( As packaged, it's not much more useful than a hacky shell script.",1283734556

It feels like they're unwilling to put constraints on their process, so it can make it largely painful rather than helpful.<p>It feels like the architecture astronauts you get some times in corporate walla walla land in software. Some people have grandiose (and costly visions) and do not feel they can be questioned on those; refusing to accept questions makes everyone else think they're full of crap, because it's usually the guy who doesn't know what he's talking about who starts going off when challenged.<p>Perhaps you're doing the same sorts of things? You're regurgitating popular layouts, etc, and not really making decisions which can be explained well nor taking into account an economy of development resources.<p>It's great working with designers <i>under</i> you. But as equals, it's very taxing to work with people who won't articulate reasoning. Questions which may figure that out:<p>Can you explain how much time different things take to do?<p>How do you know this?<p>Do your developers agree?<p>How much of your dev's portfolios have you gone over (and therefore know what they can do easily/cheaply)?",1283734323

In the introduction, he says ""You need to find a way to end the conversation without making it seem like you want the conversation to end.""  -  which is wrong, I think.

Universities currently get away with paying below industry rates partly because of the lure of research freedom: once you're tenured, you get complete freedom to define your research agenda (well, universities still have a lot of levers they can use to put pressure, but it's at least <i>relatively</i> large freedom). But if you're never going to get to that point, and have to continually justify your research in light of current grant opportunities, what's hot versus out of favor in various fields, how much your output was this year, etc., you don't necessarily have more freedom than you'd have at an industrial research lab. So I think universities would find it harder to attract researchers unless they started paying salaries on par with industry research positions, which may not make abolishing tenure a net money saver.",1283733799

1665493,comment,1664877,1664877,0,0,Goladus,,,"To me, a cloud is a distributed system of computing resources where the resources can be dynamically allocated with an API.  A hosted application should be able to increase or decrease the available processors, memory, and disk without human intervention.  Human oversight should be implemented at points where it makes sense for business and security, rather than at points dictated by the limitations of technology.  This means a cloud should do be able to do significant automated management of DNS, networking, and provisioning of fundamental operating system details.<p>The line between any classic distributed system or cluster and a 'cloud' is blurry, but generally speaking a cloud's API should be internet-compatible and capable of using commodity hardware to scale up with minimal (and preferably asynchronous) intervention from system administrators.<p>As for 'The Cloud' -- currently I don't think there is 'The Cloud' the way there is 'The World Wide Web', but it's theoretically possible.  Right now 'The Cloud' generally means 'A Public Cloud', which is a publicly available distributed system like the one I described above.  A Virtual Private Hosting service is not a cloud, because allocation of resources typically involves a sales contract of some sort.  But the service itself it might theoretically run on a cloud, and you can build a cloud out of VPSs.",1283731726

Perhaps you cannot understand why the effect the cook says the ingredient has improves the result. But then the cook could make a dish with ingredient A and without ingredient A and then you can probably taste or see the difference. If you cannot then the ingredient probably wasn't important.<p>Similarly if the UX designer says ""this label should go here"" he should be able to explain why: ""the form is easier to understand that way"". And if the client doesn't see why it is easier to understand he should be able to make two versions, and the client should be able to see why one of them is better. If the client cannot see that and the UX designer cannot convince him then it probably isn't better.",1283731598

The gate line is managed by the airline and is primarily concerned with ensuring passengers get on the right plane.  (They saved me from an impromptu trip to Seattle when I was to the JavaOne conference.  International travel does strange things to the brain.)  Another concern is earning the airline money through rigidly enforcing the class system.  (+)<p>The security line is managed by the TSA (an arm of the government) and its (stated) primary purposes are to ensure bad people and bad things do not get passed it.<p>(+) I watched the 2nd to last person onto the plane get yelled at for going through the left priority boarding line when she was holding an economy ticket, and holding an infant to boot.  They made her back up three feet and go through the economy boarding line.  It someone could have telepathically read my thoughts they would have probably taken away my Vast Right Wing Conspiracy card.",1245833383

Microsoft owns the desktop until they are unable to e.g. scare netbook builders to stop selling preinstalled Linux.""</i><p>I know we discussed this the other day (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=666787"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=666787</a>) but I think it's more a case of brand imprinting than anything.<p>When you have clueless people who buy new computers (which make up the vast majority of the consumer market), one of the things they look for is what version of windows does it come with.<p>To me, for another OS to actively take significant market share in this dominated space, they would have to overcome this preconception that consumers have.<p>To liken it to another industry, it would be like a new softdrink manufacturer having to compete against Coca Cola (with Apple being Pepsi) with their own cola brand. People instinctively go for one or the other when they go buy a cola, even if there are better products that are cheaper on the shelf.<p>That's really what it boils down too.<p>So while Linux may be free and a superior product (I personally switched to Ubuntu about 8 months ago) - it requires much more momentum than what the Linux community has right now. Which is a damn shame.",1245832955

One of the reasons I am trying literate programming is that I hope it will prod me to explain my code more.  So far I only seem to use more headings to break up my code, but this is still an improvement.",1245830728

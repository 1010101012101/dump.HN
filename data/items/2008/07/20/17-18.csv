His point #3, about IE being integrated ""deep"" into OS is absurd: IE isn't integrated into anything, in fact IE is just two DLLs, which allows them to ""merge"" iexplore.exe and explorer.exe, very similar to how conqueror works on KDE.<p>Even windows registry, the source of many issues, has nothing to do with security, since critical portions of it are read-only to a non-privileged user.",1216576670

We had only 4MB of RAM available and the requirement was to never use more than 10% of CPU, which was as powerful as 386DX (remember those?). These things operate 24/7, mounted on telephone poles, for years, without human supervision.<p>Yes, in C++.<p>As a side thought: if Apple were dumb enough to embrace Java instead of sticking to Objective-C, I doubt that OSX-powered iPhone (with a full-sized WebKit) would have been possible.

Going to sites where you disagree completely with their philosophy is called trolling.<p>You want a moral 4chan style site, go to christchan(real site btw)...thats the thing with the internet, sites that people want will always stay alive. I mean look at 4chan stats: ""Current users: 29,989"", that's almost 30,000 users using the site at the same time, so I guess there are plenty of people who don't mind the openness of the site.<p>Freedom of speech IS axiomatic, in the bill of rights they didn't write...""freedom of speech, except when it disagrees with our beliefs"", all the freedoms guaranteed by the bill of rights are not there to protect the opinions of the majority, they are there to protect the opinions of the minority.<p>Sure its not treated this way in the real world, and that's where the hypocrisy lies. All these people being proud of ""the freedoms we enjoy in America"", are usually the same people who then go around and start telling everyone what they can or can't do.<p>Internet really is the last standing bastion of actual freedoms. I can call you a little bitch when you act like one, and you won't run to the boss crying about getting your feelings hurt.<p>No there aren't any degrees, when you start applying degrees and stop giving a shit because it doesn't apply to you that's when you start helping others to strip away your own rights. The key is to set precedent, and when you have one its much easier to go for the bigger fish.<p>And here is a good quote for you: ""In Germany, they first came for the communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Catholic. Then they came for me -- and by that time there was nobody left to speak up.""<p>So you may disagree with whats being said, but you really need to take the approach of ""I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" because if you don't, it won't be long before it affects you.",1216576024

The difficulty of buying property is likely to increase.<p>So, with a good banking system, I can afford a $300,000 home.  The banking system collapses and that home is now $200,000.  The only problem is that without a good banking system, I can only afford a $50,000 home because without a mortgage, I can't pull together $300,000 or even $200,000.  This becomes a problem for renters because the number of people who can afford to become landlords/ladies decreases.  Where you had plenty of people who could buy a place with a commercial loan and pay it back over time from rental income, now you need people that can pull together cash.<p>Something is only expensive if it's hard for me to buy.  A $10 dinner isn't expensive in absolute terms, but try selling that to the majority of Sub-Saharan Africa.  Likewise, if home prices decrease, but the difficulty of getting a loan increases by more than that, it becomes more expensive to buy a home.<p>I'm hoping this won't get so bad so don't read this as my money is evaporating.

251494,comment,251065,251163,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Basically, as I mentioned above... if open source doesn't work for you, it's your fault for not fixing it.<p>Uh, I'm releasing other open source software (really free as opposed to shotgun-free, btw) which I have labored on in both private and professional time. I am already part of the  ""open source"" community in my own areas of expertise, and that's more than most people do. It is <i>not</i> my fault nor my responsibility that the OpenMoko FreeRunner's UI is in a primitive state, nor am I obligated in any way to fix it. Every developer has their spheres of expertise, and you can't expect everyone to contribute to every project. Nor do they have to contribute in order to have the right to an opinion.<p>My video was certainly more constructive and fair than it had to be, I could have <i>really</i> laid into them. All I'm doing is pointing out that the FSF's contention that the OpenMoko project is anywhere near ready to challenge the current gen of smartphones is totally absurd.<p>> The developers will love you forever if you help them fix it. So will everyone else.<p>Fortunately I have a feeling of self-worth driven by other projects besides the OpenMoko project. I don't have to be involved with the project to express an opinion about it. And can anyone who has watched the video say I was inaccurate with either of them?<p>> So get off your ass and start helping, or at least stop criticizing the people that are donating their time to help keep software Free.<p>I am not criticizing the people, I am criticizing the product and the FSF's assertions. Completely different things. The OpenMoko guys are great, and I wish them luck. They need it, the smartphone market is in high gear with a lot of competition, and Apple has set the ""good"" UI bar and ""quality"" hardware bar extremely high.<p>So stop making excuses.

I was extremely upset at the article for exposing the OpenMoko project to too much expectation too early in the game.<p>But it's not just that article, a lot of defensive open source fans are saying, ""I am happy with my FreeRunner"" and trying to look at it in a positive light.

251478,comment,251326,251399,0,0,mdasen,,,"The most obvious impact will be to the thousands of people they employ.  They will be without a job.<p>In more vague terms, it's really difficult to consider how wide-ranging the impacts will be.  Banking is actually really important.  It allows us to overcome capitalization gaps.  In a metaphor that will go over well here: Say you have a great idea, but you need 10, high-quality 2-U physical servers to do it (and the room to put them in).  Well, that's going to run you probably around $50,000 - before you have any money.  VC steps in and you all get rich.<p>Likewise, without banking, it becomes hard for you to buy a home because you can't pull the money together.  Who cares?  You rent?  Well, it becomes harder for the person who owns that building you're in to buy it and that causes rent to spike in a way that would seem unimaginable.  Likewise, the farmer who needs cash to live on until harvest can't get it and so they have to charge more for their goods, etc.<p>The price of everything goes up because the cost to cover those capitalization gaps has risen incredibly.  Worse, we'd face shortages - large ones.<p>Beyond that, Banks increase the velocity of money.  Basically, the velocity of money is the time it is between when you get $1 in your pocket and when that $1 is spent on something else.  At first, this looks like the Republican you should buy to be patriotic argument.  That's where Banks come in to actually help.  Banks allow you to get that money back into the economy without wasting it on useless things.  For example, I inherit $50,000.  I could spend it on stupid purchases that I don't want.  That might boost things in a very short-term way.  OR, I could put that $50,000 in the bank and the bank can then loan the company that needs servers that $50,000 and they are creating real value and growth in the economy.  So, banks make the economy more efficient by keeping money circulating even when you have no use for your money.  By doing this on a large enough scale (with certain safeguards), banks can guarantee you access to your money while improving economic efficiency (once your server company hits it big, you'll have lots of money you don't know what to do with when I want to remove money).<p>The issue we're seeing right now is that we got a little too ambitious.  We wanted to open home-ownership to people that probably couldn't afford it.  Now we're in a bad place where people have deposited money, but where the bank has lent it probably won't be able to pay back - the bank is facing a capitalization gap.<p>We should all hope that this is just a little blip - and it's unlikely that it will become worse than that.  People are panicking right now because there is the potential that we're hitting a, say 10%, gap that can't be covered.  When the gap is that small, banks can usually eat it in the long run (rather than go under) because it just isn't enough to kill them.  Likewise, the government might help out if it's larger because if the banking system goes under, consumer prices would rise at a rate unimaginable to anyone who didn't live during the gas crisis in the 70s - but this would apply to all goods.<p>This could be bad, but there is enough strength in these institutions that even as pieces crumble, there is too much good in them to completely die - I hope.",1216573327

It has to become like a demanding girlfriend you have to remember to txt or call. You can't dump her because she's loaded and you work for her dad.<p>The right system is totally secondary. It can be as simple as a note in your front pocket. In fact, a written note is good because you have to continually rewrite it, and that makes the tasks stick in your head. It also becomes a huge hassle to keep writing down the same things instead of getting them off the list. When I have to kill my list I do this.<p>Day to day I use google tasks (iphone-dock and firefox-sidebar) and it stays in my face all day between those two.<p>A long list is good. There's nothing that guarantees failure in todo world like having tasks like: ""Profit"". You have to break everything down to the smallest particle you can, then you knock off more things more often and you get used to using your system.<p>Determination is the most valuable skill in the world, stick with whatever you do and it will pay off in every aspect of your life.",1295632748

Not that I am an expert on either.<p>By annihilation of the self, I mean the elimination of the concept of the self, not suicide. The thought being that the concept of the self is actually an absurdity. ""Can a man step in the same river twice.""

2127954,comment,2127113,2127113,0,0,mapgrep,,,"If you're going to use the BOM despite it not being in the HTTP spec, why not ignore the spec entirely for encoding? The spec is pretty brain dead in that it says the HTTP header should override explicit declarations within the document itself.<p>When I've written this sort of code I've found it most practically effective to look at any explicit document declarations (meta tags), then the BOM, then any XML declarations (XHTML was big once upon a time), then the HTTP headers. Far more people have control over their HTML docs than over their HTTP server configuration and I think it's insane to look at the former and ignore the latter. (Actually, there was one case in which I did so: When the BOM and the HTTP headers agreed, I would ignore meta tags, which are downright wrong more often than you would think. For some reason there are a lot of pages out there encoded in UTF-8 but with meta tags declaring Latin-1 [not vice versa like you might think]. This seemed to be correlated with ColdFusion.)<p>That said, it's impressive that he's thought through different paths for text/plain and application/xml. The last, most comprehensive function I wrote to do this assumed HTML or XML, which obviously isn't comprehensive, and I missed the text/xml wrinkle.",1295629850

2127951,comment,2127116,2127432,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"1. Lift goes further in enabling convention over configuration for common AJAX tasks that are part of normal workflows, so there is less boilerplate to write.<p>2. Parallel rendering means you can move to a SOA where different components on the UI are served by different backend services.  This can be great if you have a recommendation service, a shopping cart and main content areas that are all served by different systems that may have different performance characteristics.. It also parallelizes the loading of the different parts of the page, which should decrease page load time.<p>3.  Is there good comet support in existing frameworks out of the box?  How would you easily update a partial in a rendered page when an object changes in rails or django?  With Lift, you can hook up the rendered page (and its events) to server-side Actors... without any boilerplate code.  This helps the productivity of development and (AFAIK) is still a rare feature.<p>4.  You do have complete control, it is merely a matter of style.  Lift does more things server-side.<p>5. One of the differences is that you don't need to have ""partials"", which could be more designer-friendly.  I agree that this isn't a huge win.<p>6. yep.<p>7.  I don't think the ""No Direct Object Reference"" security principle is taken care of by any other major web framework.  It is a pretty big win for security -- because all of your exposed ids are session-specific, whole classes of problems just ""go away"".<p>I'm not saying that Lift is to Rails/Django what Rails/Django was to PHP, but it does have some interesting features that set it apart.<p>Note: I have a bias.",1295629751

Morality and religion are dissimilar - maybe we will one day fully understand morality, but religion is (by religious people) in my understanding defined in terms that make it explicitly exempt from reasoning. Morality, we 'just don't understand' (maybe, depends on your position on the nature of morality, really); whereas religion is by its very nature we are said to be incapable of understanding.<p>I agree with your real point, though; what I'm saying is that religion in a class of its own, because the religious make it (or should I say 'make it up') to be that way.<p>(Related to this point, I do think that one day religion will be explained: when we fully understand the brain, how thoughts develop etc.; at that point, religion will be shown to be just a figment of our (rather, 'their') imagination. Maybe it served an evolutionary role once, who knows. Of course it won't give us insight in the nature of 'god', it will merely show that 'god' is a fabrication of our unconsciousness).",1295629544

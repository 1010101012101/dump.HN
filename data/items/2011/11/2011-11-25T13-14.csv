This isn't exactly dumb, because it's easy to take a bad angle on a runningback if you're paying too much attention to the linemen.<p>2. The linemen take one hard step forward, but not enough to get downfield, and then pass set.<p>One thing to remember about the NFL is that every single step matters.  A linebacker doesn't have to run into the line and tackle the runningback for play-action to be effective.  All he has to do is take one or two steps towards the line of scrimmage when he should be moving backwards and you can complete a pass over him.",1322229403

It's not really 'fixing' as much as it was the NFL wanting more scoring overall.<p>There is no way for the NFL to do mass game fixing because that's just too many people that have to agree to doing it.  Keep in mind this means they would need current players, ex-players and the ex <i>disgruntled</i> players too all agree to not talk.

I wouldn't go as far as to call this decision a fluke, but I've generally found the EU to make more bad decisions than good on the whole.",1322226606

GRPN may fall to half its IPO price, but it won't be a half price deal, it will simply be worth less today than it was at IPO time.<p>The markets for stocks behave very differently than the markets for, say, spa treatments, in large part because nobody has commoditized spa treatments. Buying a spa treatment for half off doesn't say something about the market valuing it differently today than yesterday, it says something about the spa's marginal cost of offering a treatment during an idle time slot and price discrimination.<p>Whereas, GRPN's price says something about market segmentation alone: The folks who bought the hype have all bought the stock and now it will trade according to the expectations of the rest of the market.",1322226582

[1]<p>Linking everything statically works usually quite well, except if you use libraries that make some assumptions about being dynamically linked (e.g. GTK+).<p>The benefit is that you have one big EXE file for which you don't even need an installer. Also, it is usually smaller than the previous bunch of DLLs because static linking omits code that won't be called anyway. You can even run an EXE packer [2] on your result, making it even small and easier to deploy. The total memory usage, however, stays the same, of course.<p>The downside is that you need a good build system for that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mingw-cross-env.nongnu.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://upx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upx.sourceforge.net/</a>",1322226280

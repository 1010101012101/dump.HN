6197396,comment,6196334,6196636,4,0,neltnerb,,,"The only sensible experiential definition I&#x27;ve heard for consciousness is the word &quot;cognizance&quot;. Meaning, consciousness is the ability to be aware. This is the term many Buddhists use in translation, and it&#x27;s by far the best fitting for me.<p>It fundamentally comes from asking the question, &quot;What am I if you strip away everything that is impermanent?&quot; Emotions are impermanent, thoughts are impermanent, sensations are impermanent... but cognizance -- if you take that away, there is no longer anything. It is the most fundamental.<p>I didn&#x27;t notice the earlier post on this, but I think all people should think deeply on this. It is not just sophomoric philosophy, it&#x27;s deeply practical, and few people bashing it understand it. That lack of understanding leads incredibly often to, well, suffering.<p>Acknowledging the nature of existence intellectually isn&#x27;t enough, you need to experience it. I see this very often in people of any age. Fear of death, fear of loss, fear of love, fear of change. But at the root, no matter what happens if you are comfortable with the nature of your own existence, you know that no one can take that cognizance away. Buddhists monks manage to light themselves calmly on fire in the interest of helping others.<p>Anyway. I obviously have many thoughts on this. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about and meditating on a great deal for over a decade. I will just end with a famous quote by Pascal.<p>All of humanity&#x27;s problems stem from man&#x27;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.<p>EDIT: I also hate it when philosophers abuse physics. I&#x27;m a physicist, so every time I hear &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; in a philosophical context I put down the book to avoid throwing it. As a friend put it, as soon as Buddhist monks can derive the ground state of the hydrogen atom, I&#x27;ll give them credit for understanding quantum mechanics. I think that people who suggest that Buddhism is related to these sorts of things know neither physics nor Buddhism.",1376275790
6197395,comment,6196334,6196334,3,0,aufreak3,,,"I didn&#x27;t come across the HN post when the original article was posted. I think the original article has many warning signs of &quot;sophomoric&quot; thinking to warrant rapid dismissal.<p>The first big bold warning sign is this -<p><pre><code>    &quot;After reading and listening to David Chalmers, I came 
    to realize that there is an intelligent argument that
    supports the idea that consciousness does not emerge 
    from the brain.
    
    <big-n-bold>Quantum Mechanics</big-n-bold>&quot;
</code></pre>
Invoking the &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; quantum mechanics to understand and explain something that isn&#x27;t even defined in the article is, indeed, &quot;sophomoric philosophy&quot;.<p>In the original article, you&#x27;ll also find this regarding the Schrodinger&#x27;s cat &quot;paradox&quot; -<p><pre><code>    &quot;Many physicists today think the many-worlds theory
    resolves this paradox by stating that there are actually 
    infinitely many universes, some in which you are dead and 
    some in which you are living, and that once the quantum 
    trigger is measured/observed, a specific universe is 
    followed.&quot;
</code></pre>
Plain wrong. The &quot;many worlds&quot; is not a &quot;theory&quot;, but an <i>interpretation</i> of quantum mechanics. It does not add any new physical mechanisms over and above what we already have in quantum mechanics - i.e. there is no &quot;once a quantum trigger is measured/observed&quot; in the many worlds interpretation. All these universes exist. Period.<p>The problem of &quot;observation&quot; in quantum mechanics is being discussed here without even a mention of &quot;decoherence&quot;. AFAIK, the unexplained part of quantum mechanics to date is the Born probabilities - i.e. why does the likelihood of observing an event correspond to the <i>magnitude square</i> of the amplitude we calculate for it. There are some recent insights into this, but I believe this is still unexplained.<p>The original thing that the article sought to explore is whether it is possible that consciousness does not come from the brain. If that is indeed the primary point to be explored in this essay, the question to be asked is what does &quot;come from the brain&quot; mean? When a current passes through a memory circuit, it toggles from 0 to 1. What does it mean to say this &quot;comes from the circuit&quot;? Does is not also &quot;come from the current&quot;?<p>We thus reach a point where all we can say is &quot;shut up and compute&quot;, for we&#x27;ve fallen into the trappings of everyday language.<p>edit: typos.",1376275771

His blog, Shtetl-Optimized[1], is also a good read (and I think the book appeared there first).<p>On a different subject, recently there were a spasm of interest in fMRI studies that showed that &quot;free&quot; choices could be predicted based on neural activity well before a &quot;conscious choice&quot; was made.[2][3][4]<p>The general consensus seemed to be &quot;Hah! Take that, free will!&quot;<p>My take on the results were that they were hardly a surprise, if consciousness is an activity of the brain. You should no more expect to make a conscious decision prior to displaying brain activity relating to the decision than you should expect to perceive a flash of light before the light bulb is lit. It would not necessarily have <i>any</i> negative implications for the existence of free will; those experiments are simply exploring the mechanism of free will.<p>On the other hand, I believe they do kind of imply that consciousness is a product of the jello in your noggin. Either that or there are some funky delays involved.<p>Now, as for the third buttock: if consciousness doesnt come from the brain, how does it work, exactly? I&#x27;d like some mechanism with my philosophy, thanks. Presumably, if I&#x27;m waving my arms around, you can trace the motor neuron activity from my appendages, up my spinal cord, and into my brain.

When I try to teach people how to fix their own problems, 90% of the time they don&#x27;t care and &quot;just want it fixed&quot;. 9% of the time they write down the instructions on a piece of paper that promptly gets lost, and the process of teaching them is considerably long than the quick fix.

The hypothetical device is &quot;observing&quot; the system during the entire experiment, so the cat is never in a superposition between dead and alive.<p>At least, I can tell you some of its other advantages.<p>First of all, wavefunction collapse is non-local. That is, if you take the wavefunction as being physically real in some sense, then collapse is an event which propagates faster than the speed of light. Because this cannot be used to actually send information faster than light, it doesn&#x27;t violate causality. But it still has a smell to it. MWI does not have this problem.<p>Another advantage of MWI is that it is deterministic. Once again, there&#x27;s no rule that says that physics has to be deterministic. But when you&#x27;re going along, finding one deterministic law after another, and then all of a sudden it seems that things are non-deterministic after all, it should give you pause.<p>There are other problems MWI solves which I don&#x27;t understand as well, most dealing with problems with wavefunction collapse. In short, collapse has a lot of properties which are highly suspicious because you just don&#x27;t see them elsewhere in physics.<p>It&#x27;s also arguably a simpler interpretation, in which case Occam&#x27;s razor applies. Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t yet have good ways of estimating the algorithmic complexity of arbitrary hypotheses, so whether this is actually the case is a matter of debate.",1376273098

2150153,comment,2149563,2149563,0,0,swirlee,,,"Interesting. As gilesc points out, this is only possible by reverse-engineering (i.e. decompiling) the Flash client to get the encryption and decryption keys (crypt_key_input.h and crypt_key_output.h [1]). It's actually pretty easy to do this--I did the same thing a few years ago as a weekend project. So why didn't I release it? Well, IANAL, but I think there are potential legal repercussions to this kind of reverse-engineering.<p>And, as gilesc also points out, Pandora regularly changes their encryption keys, which makes maintaining this kind of software kind of obnoxious. (The solution to that problem, I think, is to make the software download and parse the .swf file on startup or just on failure to yank out those fresh encryption keys itself, but I never tried it.)<p>I just cringe a bit when I see these sorts of apps, not because I think they shouldn't exist (seriously, Pandora, just release a goddamn API), but because I'm just picturing the lawsuit hammer coming down on the well-intentioned developers who are just Pandora fans.<p>Regardless, I applaud PromyLOPh's work and am keeping my fingers crossed for his continued lack of legal fees.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar/tree/master/src/libpiano"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar/tree/master/src/libpia...</a>",1296172526

Buying into ""vs. the Man"" is, ironically, one of the Man's main tools in the contemporary US; there are entire ethnic cultures in the US being held back in no small part by the belief they are being held back by the Man, which in turn requires them to be externally rescued by the don't-look-too-closely-just-believe-we're-not-the-Man-Man.<p>There's truth in the ""Man"" analysis, but the escape is to transcend the narrative, not engage with it.

It's terrible and I hate it, but about 10 minutes into my walk, I realize it's actually giving me time to think and literally appreciate the scenery.<p>I also do the 100 push-ups program after work; it's literally 5-8 minutes, so even if I feel like skipping it, I just tell myself ""Hey, it's just five minutes of your time. Skip hitting F5 on all of those sites and just do it.""<p>The best tip I can offer is to find something that suits your personality. It sounds like you feel stretched for time, so maybe you should find a quick workout, or even a quick stretching routine. Start small] five minutes three times a week, then expand once you're in the habit.<p>As far as sleeping... it's a lot like jet lag, in my experience -- it takes at least a month, if not more for your body to not only switch to begin tired/awake at all of those times, but also to switch a lot of other things over (for example, bowel movements?) so that you feel more comfortable waking up at those times. All I can suggest is to try it for at least two months without breaking your habit for any reason.

-Use Google Reader to find new stuff to read every day, and save with Instapaper or bookmarks. Do the same thing as before: peruse random stuff, save really interesting stuff.
-Don't read everything. Be selective. There's too much stuff to read out there, and understand that it's a lot better to have a deep understanding of one thing than just absorb headings and pictures. You'll find that you'll learn a lot more, and remember interesting statistics and bits of information that pop up in random areas of life.

I can appreciate this line of thinking.<p>Another way of thinking about it....if there is a forceful, non-voluntary, ongoing transfer of money from one group of people to another group, should the recipients of the money, or their advocates, not have some obligation (on an ongoing basis), to justify the aggregate benefits to society of this wealth transfer?  Can you appreciate this line of thinking, at all?<p>Don't confuse this with me suggesting the unemployed should be cut off and thrown out on the street.

It's just as likely that modern marketers are just doing what people want. That the current system of distraction, consumption, and unhealthiness is evolutionary and not some master plan of a cadre of evil overlords. Sure, it makes for a better straw man to bounce your essay off of, but it's flawed. If nothing else, it assumes a personality for a thing that quite obviously involves tens of thousands of people acting independently. Usually (almost always, really) such systems are emergent in nature.<p>I understand all the emotional buttons that are being pushed with this, and by all means enjoy your time reading it. I enjoy a good rant and pipe dream about ""rational social planning"" as much as the next guy. All I ask is to take a little time and ask ""Am I being manipulated by people I should hate? Or am I being told a story and a narrative about people to hate so that I can be manipulated?""<p>EDIT: Of course the truth is somewhere in-between, and I didn't mean to make a false dichotomy. Most times these types of reasoning errors are simply artifacts of the way people solve problems. So, for instance, if you feel that systems are controlled from the top-down, you are more likely to see a dysfunctional system and assume that it was made that way from the top-down. Those of us who have studied dysfunctional systems can only wish that things were that simple. They aren't.",1296171236

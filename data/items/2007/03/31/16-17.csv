7831,comment,7829,7829,0,0,ginn,,,"Reading the forum, I noticed a lot of you are applying to Techstars and Y.  If you were accepted to Techstars, you will have to give an acceptance decision by April 16th. However, lets say you were given an interview to Y but acceptance is not offered until April 29th.  So what would you do?<p>Take a leap of faith and wait for Y, knowing that you just given up a sure opportunity to be mentored or go for Techstars?<p>Of course both are great programs",1175359240

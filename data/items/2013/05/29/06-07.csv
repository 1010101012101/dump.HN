So nearly ten years without a meaningful response for the most updated issue on the issue tracker.<p>It's a similar case for many of the other issues on the site.<p>The site itself seems like a good idea, at least they're tracking the problem, but I can't fathom why they can't get some of these simple fixes in. Would this be better if it was open source? Perhaps, but there's still the problem of getting patches / pull requests in past the gatekeepers. Maybe the real money makers come from somewhere else so they can afford to ignore the community feedback, or maybe they're so locked in with existing users that there's no incentive for them to pay attention to them when they can work on getting new customers.",1369810786

The style will ensure minimal impact on those who should read it.<p>Small point: why the focus on the Roma as against non-Roma Romanians and Bulgarians who are also very poor but shut up, get down to work and obey the law. Anecdotally (I live in Romania) I would say that many Roma do just that. Plenty join the professions as doctors, lawyers, engineers and media folk or simply do an ordinary job of work but there is a criminal minority who are the authors of their own problems.

5785024,comment,5784074,5784626,3,0,icambron,,,"I think you're missing the point. The argument is not, as far as I can tell, that fancy schools provide no signal at all. What it's saying is that they're unfortunately the best proxy historically available, but that it's possible to improve on it. You've marshaled various arguments on why it might be a decent proxy, and of course other people can marshal arguments on why it's not as good as you think. That's a reasonable debate, though I disagree with your side of it (context: I went to MIT for undergrad and have worked in the job market for almost a decade with people from a broad range of educational backgrounds). But I don't think it's the relevant debate.<p>The point is that regardless of the merits of a Yale degree, it doesn't really come close to measuring, ""will this person be good at this job?"" Signaling is a shortcut, something you do because you don't have time or energy to measure something more directly aligned with what you need. It's not wrong, just a blunt instrument. Yale will graduate tons of dud candidates, and far lesser schools will graduate hoards of great ones, even if they do so at a lower rate. So the question is, can we create a more precise tool for measuring what we actually want to measure? We should certainly be trying. A Yale education might be well correlated to, say, the ability to learn quickly, but a good test for the ability to learn quickly would be even better correlated. If the talents that got you into Yale, not to mention the stellar education you got there, cause you do better in those measurements, then good for you! (None of that is to say this particular company is successful at this measurement, BTW.)<p>Another thing that went unstated in the article is value. Yale (and MIT) grads are expensive! Penn State grads, relatively speaking, are not, which creates a huge incentive to find the good ones and hire them instead. So at the very least, you should agree there's a big opportunity in a more precise tool for separating the chaff from the wheat, even if you think all the Yale wheat is pre-husked.",1369810609

Focused drive makes it easier not only for the viral growth but it also makes it easier to create your overall marketing plan.  Just like target market it is the basis for creating a marketing roadmap, Unique Spreading Point is the basis for creating a successful viral plan.  This does not mean you stick with that one point forever; in due course, successful companies create many little things to make it easy for their users to spread the word.    In the beginning sticking with one main point makes it easier to focus on all fronts including faster entry to the market.  The cost and time for getting multiple viral plans in the beginning may be just too high.  Hope this helps.",1369810448

Also thanks for introducing me to the phrase ""rubber hose cryptography"", I didn't know that.<p>It is probably good to keep in mind what you said. All passwords are only as good as your ability to keep them for yourself.<p>Also remember that if someone (feds) would had physical access to your computer while encrypted data is mounted, then the password doesn't matter. Even if you manage to turn off the computer, they could still decrypt the keys by ""cold boot attack""[1] within minutes after shutdown. Actually anybody can do that easily. [2]<p>For normal-purpose encryption that this thread is about, it would be too much hassle, but if I had something I would want to really encrypt and be sure nobody would get to it, then:\n1. I would use multiple layers of encryption with the possibility to decrypt one layer in multiple ways (plausible deniability)\n2. Would not rely on password only, but also use some external key/token, maybe something like this: <a href=""https://www.crypto-stick.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crypto-stick.com/</a>\n3. Make the access to data quickly destroyable if I choose so. Several options come to my mind. E.g. make the key/token easily destroyable for me. Other option would be to physically destroy the media where data is stored. These would render the data inaccessible if I choose so. I would of course lose the data.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://vr-zone.com/articles/bitlocker-pgp-truecrypt-cracked-real-time-with-299-tool/18466.html#ixzz2FdtkooOw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vr-zone.com/articles/bitlocker-pgp-truecrypt-cracked-...</a>",1369810062

It is a mistake to constrain the increase in domain to larger or more frequent diffs. Code is a tool you have for solving problems. If you were gardening, you might plant flowers or pull weeds. Increasing your scope does not mean planting more flowers or pulling more weeds (though you should expect to be faster and more proficient at that as you become more experienced).

Interesting take, but I'm not sure I agree, or perhaps I misunderstand.<p>In the initial example, I represented 'good' as a set for ease of understanding, but, in practice, unless a client specifically requests an older version of a data item, the system serves the latest value written to 'good'. That is, the system does not expose a read() that returns multiple values. Rather, clients can read_good(key) or read_by_version(key, timestamp), both of which return a single version/write.<p>This is different from deciding which ""transaction you will accept as valid and which you will reject."" Many database systems perform in-place updates, but they must either either 1.) choose a winner across multiple writes (as I described below, distributed databases often employ what's called ""last writer wins"") or 2.) abort multiple writes. However, a large class of database systems (e.g., Oracle, Postgres) employ what's called multi-version concurrency control, whereby the database stores multiple versions of each data item. The system has a total commit order on transactions which determines what version a transaction should read() from the database. But, say, in Oracle, if:<p>1.) I start a transaction<p>2.) You start a transaction<p>3.) You modify variable X<p>4.) You commit<p>5.) I read X<p>Under what's known as Snapshot Isolation, I will read X as of the start of my transaction (i.e., I will not read your write to X even though it's ""present"" in the database). This is often accomplished via MVCC techniques.<p>> The paper describes this scheme as READ Committed which doesn't make generally make sense except in the context of a database with secondary indexes.<p>I tend to disagree. This is probably another conversation, but databases rarely guarantee serializable isolation (see <a href=""http://www.bailis.org/blog/when-is-acid-acid-rarely/#acidtable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailis.org/blog/when-is-acid-acid-rarely/#acidtab...</a>), and Read Committed is a fairly commonly deployed model. It's true that serializability is often required for correct operation. But, perhaps interestingly, many databases like Oracle 11g and SAP HANA do not provide it as an option (largely due to poor performance and deadlock avoidance), and, anecdotally, models like Read Committed are 2-3x faster than serializability.<p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by applicability to secondary indexing (rather, I think there <i>are</i> other use cases, though I'm excited about 2i applications). However, I'm genuinely curious if I'm missing something.",1369808568

I can imagine that trying to sell adoption of emerging transitory technology into a massive financial system would have seemed an unwarranted risk.<p>Magnetic ink doesn't care who reads it and magnetic ink readers don't care if they're driven by vacuum tubes, transistors, microprocessors, or (we hope) photonic integrated circuits. The vision that went into this project was phenomenal. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the foundation of our modern electronic banking?<p>Another point on obsolescence: consider microprocessors in satellites and probes. I understand that well proven circuitry is required, which by nature is obsolete because it trails newer system in features and performance.<p>""Traditionally, space-qualified single board computers (SBCs) have trailed the cutting-edge commercial and military products by factors of performance often times in excess of 10-100x.""<p>See: <a href=""http://www.cotsjournalonline.com/home/article.php?id=100088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cotsjournalonline.com/home/article.php?id=100088</a><p>So the technology was obsolete for ""new technology"" but it still was suitable for the purpose it was intended, whether finance or space exploration, both areas we don't want to make mistakes.",1235966223

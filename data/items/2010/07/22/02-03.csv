Steve said exactly that in his D8 interview. Frankly, most people like that. Apple makes decisions about stuff most people don't care about.<p>To explain the ""cynical"" part, I'll make a tenuous parallel to Thomas Jefferson who said the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.<p>Ultimately, people are responsible for keeping themselves informed, not creating monopolies, not giving too much power to certain people, governments or companies and so on so the Apple strategy is fanning ignorance because, let's face it, most people want to enjoy ""freedom"" without having to actually do anything about it.",1279767255

1537191,comment,1536946,1537119,0,0,tmsh,,,"Right, but the problem is that the root node is always going to be Python, and any code that uses Python is going to have to go through the root node (hence all Python code is really part of the root subtree). This becomes problematic if you have more than one queue that you're watching (e.g., input, network, graphics output, etc.).<p>Were it possible to have Python code be in some non-root node, it'd be great (e.g., for parsing text, or doing something algorithmic). As it is, when everything has to be fed through the interpreter, the design becomes top-heavy from a performance standpoint because the slow stuff is on top. And any time you want to optimize something but then use some Python, you're stuck (it becomes part of the root subtree again).<p>At least that was my experience. But Python does encourage interesting alternatives for performance (with generators, etc.). And if you're already mostly doing Python anyway (I'd say the threshold has to be 70%), then it seems to make sense (v. the opportunity cost of switching contexts between languages -- if you are spending more than 30% in C, I find it difficult).<p>But it's a really interesting issue.

1537183,comment,1534943,1536732,0,0,madair,,,"Well, my point was also not clear in that people may presume that I'm criticizing the developers themselves. I work with a lot of developers, some of them very good at software, but most not, but they are very good coworkers, hard working, and they get a lot done which fulfills the needs of the business, and they actually do themselves want to improve and are intrigued by techniques they didn't know about or that they reserved in their minds for ""geniuses"" which they assume that they are not.<p>I think that the implication that people may presume in my critique above is that I think the problem is the developers not being better, but that's perception is a big part of the profit motive that I'm critiquing. If success is a zero sum game then sure, you want only the best, but what I'm critiquing is that it is that very same zero sum game which makes it harder for these corporate developers to get ahead. I'm not charging some evil master plan, just that it's not realistic to presume that all developers must be top of their game at any one point in their career, or even that it must be their primary motivation in life.<p>I don't think the problems these developers face are only related to contemporary society seeing the corporate profit motive prerogative as paramount. It's also the attitudes of other developers who look down on them and put them down and actively detract from the reputation of those ""corporate drones"" who aren't as good as them. How about maybe didn't have the same opportunities? How about didn't get the same influences in school? How about just not having any mentors to show them the ropes? I find myself mentoring <i>a lot</i> and yet I also find it important to not be patronizing, but that's not very hard when I appreciate and am thankful to be working with these developers because they have so many good qualities, even if they haven't yet learned some abstract coding concepts and maybe aren't even interested in learning them.<p>But bleeding heart for the poor drones is not even the point, that's patronizing in itself. I think the self-described non-drone developers that look at things this way who are as negatively affected by the perception problems. On a delusionary scale of one to ten who's the more delusional one? The true believer in the way things work right now and is hoping for their big Startup break so that they too will be winners and <i>free</i>? Or the corporate drone developer who's a survivor, who's often an immigrant or foreign worker, who's sending remittances home every year, or who's already lost all hope and for whom thinking about career is about the time they reach for the depression meds.<p>It's also worth considering that the negative weight that is assigned to these developers is just plain factually wrong. First of all the corporations that hire them are making buttloads of money upon the work of these ""unskilled"" developers. And anyway, what exactly should we do with this supposedly dead weight? Throw them out of the village? Banishment? Their lives aren't worth as much? There isn't a place for them at the success in life table like there is for the better developers? Is it that they don't work as hard? Really? Hmmm...and what is this work of which you speak, bank software? Health insurance statement producing doofangles that too 65 hours a week for the past two months because the integration with the COBOL backend was acting up again and the nightly batch jobs from partner corps sent to the FTP dropbox were frequently corrupted? Hmmm.<p>And then some smartass comes along and tells them they're stupid for using FTP or some other random criticism, some developer <i>always</i> has a better way to do it of course, but fails to realize that the developer they are talking about simply has no say, no time to research, and nobody pointing to sources of information that will make it easier. Not everyone reads HN.<p>I think the problem may not be those less skilled developers, the problem is social conditioning and the narrative of what success is being all wrong.<p>We might talk a good game about looking for happiness in all the right places but that seems to break down pretty damn quick the moment we start critiquing those drones for not being good enough workers for the greater good. So what is is? Socialist or Capitalist? Or is the Left and Right narrative that guides our intellectual, political, and populist debate simply completely broken to begin with. But I think that broken narrative are what guides the conversation and attitudes as they relate to the concept of better or worse developers and how they contribute to us, presumably the great ones that is.<p>So my actual criticism is really about the attitudes, both those ""greater good"" attitudes, and those profit motive constraints which remove so much of the joy in a job well done. ""More bricks, less hay"" seems to be all we hear in corporate-land. Or at least, that's all I hear, maybe your bigcorp is a healthier society.",1279766005

1537158,comment,1536792,1536792,0,0,grellas,,,"The nature this case in relation to how it is being reported fascinates me. Let me summarize while making a few observations:<p>1. A guy comes out of nowhere and files a lawsuit in a state court in Allegany County, New York (population: about 50,000 - <a href=""http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36003.html</a>).<p>2. The lawsuit is filed on June 30, 2010 and consists of a grand total of 2 pages of allegations, coupled with a request for relief (see <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/34239119/Ceglia-v-Zuckerberg-complaint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/34239119/Ceglia-v-Zuckerberg-compl...</a>).<p>3. Among the substantive allegations are absurdly wrong ones (from a lawyer standpoint), such as the allegation in paragraph 3 that Facebook is a ""domestic corporation"" in New York. Facebook is in fact a foreign corporation that is qualified to do business in New York, as is shown by the very attachment the lawyer appends to the complaint itself (Exhibit B). I make this point only to highlight a certain level of sloppiness that attends this whole matter. This is hardly a mark of top-flight lawyering.<p>4. The contract states that it is entered into as a ""Purchase agreement and 'work made for hire' that reflects two separate business ventures,"" the first for something called StreetFax Database and the second for the ""continued development of the software, programs, and for the purchase and design of a suitable website for the project Seller has already initiated that is designed to offer the students of Harvard university [sic] access to a website similar to a live functioning yearbook with the working title 'The Face Book'."" Mr. Ceglia was to pay to Mr. Zuckerberg $1,000 for the work he did on StreetFax and an additional $1,000 for the work he did on ""The Face Book."" In turn, Mr. Ceglia was to receive (with respect to the ""Face Book"" work, the following: ""It is agreed that the Purchaser will own a half interest (50%) in the software, programming language and business interests derived from the expansion of that service to a larger audience."" The contract then provides that ""the agreed upon completion for the expanded project with working title 'The Face Book' shall be January 1, 2004 and an additional 1% interest in the business will be due the buyer for each day the website is delayed from that date.""<p>5. The agreement appears to be a canned document and is poorly drafted. Since its terms appear to be heavily slanted in favor of Mr. Ceglia, it is probably fair to assume that this was his form of contract which he presented to Mr. Zuckerberg (then a student) to sign.<p>6. The complaint then alleges that the website was completed on February 4, 2004 (paragraph 7) and asserts that Mr. Ceglia is therefore entitled to an extra 34% of ""the business,"" (paragraph 8) or 84% in total.<p>7. A few comments on the above:<p>(a) can anyone say ""vagueness"" and ""uncertainty"" as serious problems with this contract? with no company formed at the time, this is a guy who essentially hired Mr. Zuckerberg to develop a website that was to be like a ""live yearbook"" and who claims that he is to have an 84% stake in <i>any</i> future expansion of that idea to be made by Mr. Zuckerberg, no matter what form it took and no matter who else contributed value to build that business; this in essence is a claim by Mr. Ceglia that, at any time and under under any circumstances, he can pull a piece of paper out of his pocket and claim a perpetual non-dilutable stake in somebody's company based on a work-for-hire contract for a small development fee done before that company was even to be formed; thus, every founder who might work in that company, even for years, every investor who might invest in it, and every other stakeholder (including innocent purchasers for value who bought shares in the company in secondary trading), all such persons were to work, sweat, and toil, taking huge risks all the while, and all were to be subject to dilution - except for Mr. Ceglia, who could take his sweet time and come forward at any time with his claim of an 84% non-dilutable interest;<p>(b) if not vagueness, how about an unenforceable penalty? How would you react to someone who told you he would pay $1,000 for some development work and then take 1% of your company for every <i>day</i> delay in completing the project? Such terms are outrageous to say the least and probably serve to render the entire contract unenforceable, particular when the contract as a whole amounts to an alleged non-dilutable stake in a business no matter what future form it might take;<p>(c) how about statutes of limitations? New York apparently has a 6-year statute for breach of a written agreement. If the work was done by February 4, 2004, then Mr. Zuckerberg's obligation to perform would have started on that date. The complaint was filed on June 30, 2010, well past the 6-year deadline. Thus, on its face, the claim appears to be time-barred. One can of course allege facts for why the statute did not begin to run until a later date. This complaint fails to do so.<p>(d) Other equitable defenses would almost certainly apply so as to preclude assertion of any claim for equitable relief after such a long delay (laches being the most obvious - I discussed this in an earlier comment, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1509601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1509601</a>).<p>Thus, all in all, a lawsuit full of holes is built up by sensationalist reporting into a supposed major threat to Facebook and to Mr. Zuckerberg.<p>This is where the reporting becomes interesting. I think this relates to a strong impulse to see Mr. Zuckerberg get some sort of comeuppance for whatever reason.<p>The case got major headlines nationwide because a judge in a small state court entered a TRO, with the reports touting the idea that this gave the claim more gravitas because judges do not enter a TRO lightly. Yet this judge <i>did just that</i>. He entered the order even though the defendants had been given no notice of the application and even though the plaintiff made no showing whatever of likelihood of success on the merits and of alleged irreparable harm that he would suffer if the defendants were not enjoined from transferring assets while the TRO was in effect (see the brief filed by Facebook making these points, <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/34240120/Ceglia-v-Facebook-Motion-for-Dissolution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/34240120/Ceglia-v-Facebook-Motion-...</a>). Without getting into technicalities, this amounts to a court having concluded that the TRO had to be entered to cover a 15-day period in which Mr. Ceglia might otherwise suffer <i>irreparable harm</i> absent a court order barring any transfer of Facebook assets during that period. After a nearly 7-year delay, it is basically absurd that such an order should have been entered. No possible harm could have come to Mr. Ceglia over a 15-day period that would have been any different from whatever risk he had faced for the nearly 7 years pre-dating the order. Thus, the TRO was ill-conceived at best and the federal court to which this case was removed immediately stayed its effect upon getting the case (the parties have since agreed to allow it to expire and die a merciful death).<p>In this piece, then, we get a subtitle stating or implying that the claims made by Facebook's lawyers (that this lawsuit was frivolous) were in themselves frivolous. Why? Because we now have an admission by Mr. Zuckerberg's lawyers that he did indeed sign the contract. This is then touted as some sort of setback for Facebook's case.<p>From a lawyer's standpoint, this is all really <i>weird</i>. This case is full of holes and represents at best a wild swing at Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg. The contract is worded in a flaky manner. The terms themselves are outrageous by any measure (think about you would react if someone claimed a perpetual stake in whatever you did just because he paid you a small fee for a minor development effort). The lawyering in support is slipshod at best. Yet, in spite of all this, the reporting on it is building continual momentum such that it is perceived as a serious problem for the company and all because a judge entered an ill-conceived TRO and because of the basically irrelevant fact that Mr. Zuckerberg's lawyers admit that he signed the contract (a fact never previously denied). Yes, this all makes for high drama, but it also makes for highly inaccurate reporting on the legal merits of what is happening.<p>At most, in my view, this case represents a nuisance claim against Facebook, as no court in the world is about to prejudice the interests of innocent investors, co-founders, employees and the like for the sake of some guy who comes out of the woodwork after long delays with a wildly worded contract that is of dubious enforceability. While a court might be more open to entertaining a claim against Mr. Zuckerberg personally, even that is so dubious here as to be barely worth considering.<p>There are obviously many people who want to see Mr. Zuckerberg get what is due to him but this will <i>not</i> be the channel by which that might happen, notwithstanding the reporting on the case. In the end, this will be tried to a federal court and not in the blogs. And, in the courts, this thing is going nowhere.<p>I am, by the way, no apologist for Mr. Zuckerberg and have been quite critical of his actions in relation to the whole ConnectU mess (which <i>does</i> pose a serious risk for him and for Facebook, as I discussed in an earlier comment, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362379</a>).",1279765145

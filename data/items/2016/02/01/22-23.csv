When scientists were investigating the increased prevalence of gastric and other GI cancers in  Asian countries, they turned their attention to Braken fern, whose shoots (fiddleheads) are commonly eaten in Asia, as well as in US. Turns out Braken fern contains a well known and documented carcinogen called ptaquiloside or PTA. It causes cancer in animals and in humans. But here&#x27;s the kicker: Danish scientist Lars Holm Rasmussen released a study in 2004 showing that the carcinogenic PTA compound in bracken fern can leach from the plant into the water supply, which may explain an increase in the incidence of gastric and esophageal cancers in bracken-rich areas. Such as Pacific NW of US. (There is also evidence that PTA is spread through inhalation of pores of ferns!)<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11945131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11945131</a>",1454367543

11016318,comment,11013185,11013185,0,0,danharaj,,,"I&#x27;m a Haskell contractor who currently works with a tech stack that looks like PostgreSQL, Haskell (backend), Haskell (frontend), and Nix. Stuff gets deployed to AWS.<p>things i hate about nix:<p>1. The nix language isn&#x27;t haskell. It&#x27;s a very spartan functional programming language. errors can be unhelpful and it is difficult to find thorough documentation. There&#x27;s not much sugar and it has few abstraction facilities beyond higher order functions (like ML modules or Haskell type classes). In order to grok nix, I recommend reading the nix manual[1] thoroughly and this series of blog posts [2]. Honestly though nix would be much more powerful if it were embedded in a full fledged functional language instead of trying to focus on just package description. i am many orders of magnitude less efficient at writing nix as i am haskell. guix looks interesting but i haven&#x27;t tried it seriously: check it out too.<p>2. the caching system is a little boned. if a cache goes down, the builder will wait forever to get the metadata from the server instead of ignoring it. there is a timeout setting but it only applies to downloading the actual binaries, not the .narinfo files. the workaround is to disable binary caches for that invocation. it is an annoyance since i often work on projects with flaky cache servers.<p>things i like about nix:<p>1. i haven&#x27;t fucked up my computer with NixOS yet. upgrading everything Just Works. If it doesn&#x27;t Just Work, reverting Just Works. You have to go rather far out of your way to put a NixOS system in an inconsistent state. I might be a somewhat reckless user, but i used to put my Ubuntu installations in inconsistent states regularly.<p>2. i can create a good sandboxed environment for any project with relatively little effort. it doesn&#x27;t matter how many languages or arcane dependencies there are. there are no subtle bugs caused by interfering components: if there&#x27;s interference it&#x27;s a build error; if there isn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re good.<p>3. if you&#x27;ve used a build system in anger and you can only come up with two complaints and neither of them are &quot;it has trouble building the thing&quot;, then you&#x27;ve found a good build system. i&#x27;ve never had to worry about dependencies, reproducible builds, sharing binaries with colleagues or anything. in spite of all the warts of the language and the byzantine user experience, by god it works.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nixos.org/nix/manual/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/nix/manual/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://lethalman.blogspot.com/2014/07/nix-pill-1-why-you-should-give-it-try.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lethalman.blogspot.com/2014/07/nix-pill-1-why-you-sho...</a><p>AMA",1454367447
11016317,comment,11008340,11015538,0,0,bdamm,,,"I think the author is embellishing.  While it may be trickier than driving a truck, this is not on the same scale of difficulty as operating a large freight train, where the operator needs to consider where the back of the train is in relation to the locomotive, nor as difficult as operating an airliner, where a momentary navigational error could put the entire airship underground in a matter of seconds.<p>I&#x27;d expect that trainee engineers are trained on specific routes.  Whereas a car or truck driver would be expected to operate safely on roads they&#x27;ve never encountered before, this should not be the case for a passenger train engineer.  So the difficulty would be doubly embellished.<p>It appears to me that the most difficult part about driving a train is remaining alert and sober, absorbing and executing the restrictions on the track, and doing so confidently well in advance of turns or restrictions.  The theory presented in the article, that he was injured as a result of a rock throw and lost control of the train, seems like as good a conclusion as any.  Especially given how unusually dedicated the purported evidence shows him to be.",1454367433

The school itself doesn&#x27;t add anything to their success; it&#x27;s just that those who are going to be more successful anyway, regardless of school, are better at getting into harder-to-get-into schools.<p>And as for the connections, these comments keep talking about how the better schools give you better connections. If so, this research showing no mid-career earnings advantage suggests that if those &quot;better&quot; connections are worth anything at all, it isn&#x27;t money or things that show up as more money such as better jobs, more access to jobs, more job stability, etc. My interpretation, though, and my own experience, is that the connections ARE worth money, but that birds of a feather soon flock together after graduation, regardless of where they went to school.

At that point I reckon we start slipping into philosophy.<p>Philosophers are aware that &quot;inside/outside&quot; is sometimes a vague distinction for objects of interest like humans and they now know better than to intentionally pursue a strong programme of dualism.<p>See e.g. <a href=""https://www.umass.edu/complit/aclanet/DualFFem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.umass.edu/complit/aclanet/DualFFem.html</a> for comments on the kind of cultural ideas I&#x27;m referring to.<p>My point is not that opposites/oppositions don&#x27;t occur in technology, but that they are rampant in much cultural production.

George Boole himself apparently had some funny dualistic ideas, of the kind later promulgated in &quot;Laws of Form&quot; by Spencer-Brown. Dualism is seductive and gets elaborated into huge (and often prejudiced) systems of values.<p>The reality is that most of what computers do is necessarily digital, but not necessarily binary. The bits are down there but they don&#x27;t totally determine the nature of the software. Yes, bits correspond to on/off.

It&#x27;s essential to stop in the correct places, but it&#x27;s also necessary to keep accelerations smooth (we don&#x27;t want all the wagons bumping together, or slipping wheels), including up and downhill. Driving must also be efficient, and with good planning it&#x27;s easily possible to coast many miles on a slight gradient. (Did everyone just get off the train at the stadium? Then the braking distance will change. Except it&#x27;s raining now, so it&#x27;s longer.) Acknowledge every signal, and run to time — being early means being stopped, which is wasteful (and annoying for passengers, if this is a passenger train), being late means delaying other trains.<p>--<p>I read some of the accident reports from the British RAIB, since they&#x27;re often interesting.  It&#x27;s hardly ever one failure, even for something that seems straightforward.  Some of the reports show charts of management structures, since many problems come down to organizational mismanagement — the safety equipment exists, but perhaps wasn&#x27;t maintained, or a fault wasn&#x27;t repaired soon enough.

If someone&#x27;s paranoid fantasies happen to correspond to reality, that doesn&#x27;t make them more trustworthy.<p>I completely agree with that.

In many shady events, there are state-level interests, and many of parties involved have interests themselves.<p>For example, many of the anti-conspiracy researchers are trying to debunk everything they perceive could help the right-wing movements.

But, to quote from that: &quot;Instead of installing packages via yum or apt, CoreOS uses Linux containers to manage your services at a higher level of abstraction. A single service&#x27;s code and all dependencies are packaged within a container that can be run on one or many CoreOS machines.&quot;<p>So, you&#x27;re now managing &quot;containers&quot; instead of &quot;packages&quot;. What&#x27;s the difference in terms of making them reproduce-able and reliable? Very little (though there are big differences in how you deploy them and how they behave when deployed). You still need tools to manage the complexity of reliably building these containers (a &quot;higher level of abstraction&quot; that contains many more moving parts than a single package, generally speaking). They&#x27;ve built configuration management (etcd), and they use existing tools or custom tools for the &quot;packaging&quot; part of the equation (Docker or rkt). Even though they&#x27;re calling it a &quot;container&quot;, you&#x27;re still building and deploying software...now only with less mature tools than the old ones we&#x27;ve been using for 20 years.<p>Someone has to build those containers, and someone has to use tools to do so reliably and predictably.<p>I&#x27;m saying that NixOS seems to provide better tools (for both configuration management and for packaging) than the current popular solutions. It surprises me that more people haven&#x27;t embraced it for doing this stuff. I&#x27;m just saying I think NixOS would be an ideal candidate for the same spaces where people are using CoreOS and Docker or CoreOS and rkt.",1454364498

If even one of them decides to change allegiance (which should be somewhat likely if we are describing these people as &quot;opportunistic&quot;) the conspiracy ceases to be pure speculation.  For example, look at the sequence of events that eventually outed Lance Armstrong.<p>> They simply do not fathom the ruthlessness of the political or business world.<p>&quot;Ruthlessness&quot; is a spectrum.

And self-encouragement to act on a task tends to take the form of saying out loud, &quot;it&#x27;ll be better <i>when it&#x27;s done</i>.&quot;<p>But in both cases, talking it up does nobody any good. It&#x27;s the mind being directed towards rationalizations about the future as a destination, a place to arrive at with a tidy fairy tale ending, and life doesn&#x27;t really have those. What life has a lot of is journeys conducted by routine, accented with pivotal chance events. Whatever happens, you wake up the next day and continue. And <i>that</i> is depressing if you&#x27;re convinced that an ending should take place!",1454364061

11015860,comment,11011923,11014285,0,0,StillBored,,,"> Not sure exactly what you mean by the &quot;hardware support&quot; part,<p>Yes I should have been clearer, and said no penalty or minimal penalty, support for base+offset address calculation. A fair number of machines a couple decades ago, had additional latency or throughput penalties for addressing modes that required address calculation. This is still true in some cases for more complex calculations. So the use of pointer arithmetic was in many cases noticeably faster than using array syntax even though they are functionally the same. This was also partially due to the compilers not being smart enough (or not having enough registers) to dedicate one explicitly for the resulting address (and using register indirect) if the programmer was using a base[offset] calculation.<p>For example, the ARM I&#x27;m using at the moment has a 1 cycle latency penalty for certain scaled displacements. This means that if your looping over an array of 16 bit ints it will be faster to use a pointer to the integers if the compiler fails to increment the index by 2 and instead uses a (base+offset * 2) load/store. This means the compiler has to be fairly smart about code that uses the index&#x27;s absolute value as well as its &quot;offset&quot; value in an array.<p>(BTW the particular ARM in question does base+offset*4 or 8 at full speed).",1454364005

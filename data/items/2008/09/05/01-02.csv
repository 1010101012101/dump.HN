295432,comment,295068,295377,0,0,william42,,,"Agreed.  Personally, I find advertising much less annoying than having to pay for things directly, especially online where it's still easy to phish.  The only ads I block are the obnoxious Flash ones.",1220579807
295431,comment,295270,295270,0,0,briansmith,,,"I disagree with the Slinkset guy about reddit just a destination site. This year, reddit has rolled out features that let you (1) create your own reddits, (2) theme them, and (3) publish them on your own domain. Those features are a clear indication that reddit doesn't want to be just a destination site. The next logical step for reddit is advertising revenue sharing.",1220579699

Sounds like utter scaremongering.<p>I don't really see how Google can face an antitrust challenge over Chrome: they don't dominate the browser space, they aren't product-tying or doing anything that could be construed as abusive, they don't even force you to use their search engine within Chrome, and the entire source is offered permissively and they've encouraged other vendors to use it in their products. If anything they are /encouraging/ competition in the browser space.",1220579613
295429,comment,295373,295410,0,0,jasonb05,,,"cheers wheels<p>your ""crotchety"" point's a good one. in fact, it's a frequent point of discussion within the team. the website!=business comment is a common rebuke for us.<p>my position is agreement with your statement. ""something people want"" is a starting point, a primer for the business. rather than four business in four months, I argue 4 seeds, some of which may grow into viable business, and most that won't.<p>Further, trying to grow 4 business at a time (come November) is equally insane. The niches are small (we call them micro startups - one month to address the core need, the ""one thing""), and the end of the year might be a good time to weed.<p>nevertheless, we are learning a tremendous amount about the process, about users, and about how much we truly don't know. and damn it's better than working in an office!",1220579591

In this case, consider two bloggers Alice and Betty.

How many are really PDA apps? Or tablet apps?<p>a ""mobile"" startup is a company concentrating on ""mobility."" There's a lot of opportunity there.

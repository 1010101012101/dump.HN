The industry a person picks to start a business has a huge effect on the odds that it will grow. If you go back 20 years or so, about 4% of all the startups in the computer and office equipment industry made the Inc. 500, 0.005% of startups in the hotel and motel industries made that list, and 0.007% of startups in eating and drinking establishments.""<p>This ignores cause and effect. Presumably a lot of business in the hotel and motel industries are simple mom and pop shops with no intention of growing. This is almost never true for ""the computer and office equipment industry"" Also presumably there there is a significant difference in the capabilities of founders in these two industries.<p>I hate when writers cannot see beyond their numbers, and cannot distinguish between cause and effect.<p>That being said I found it interesting that ""you have to hit the top 10% to have income as an entrepreneur better than what you would have gotten working for other people.""<p>Maybe if I hadn't done those startups I would have a red ferrari by now ;-)",1201352406

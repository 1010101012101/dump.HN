Why would you want to kill the incentive for working on good ideas by preventing their creators from having control over them for a time after they create them?  The capitalist system has shown over and over that financial incentives drive progress more quickly and more surely than any other system ever devised by any society on earth.  Content creation isn't magically different.<p>Further, why would you so callously wrest away control of someone's labor?  That person who created that thing has a meritorious right to benefit from that labor.  To ignore that person's right to the benefits of his labor is to enslave him in a society of forced egalitarianism.  It's basically, morally wrong, and it always seems to go hand-in-hand with ruthlessly authoritarian communist regimes... and there are reasons for that.",1331600295

I almost gave that person a blanket statement to not use IDs, but I guided him towards reusable classes instead.<p>It all boils down to reusability though.  If you have an ID, say for a #promoCol, sure, there may only be 1 promo column on the page now, but what happens when the client/designer says, hey we need a promoCol on the right side as well?  Do you go back and refactor #promoCol to .promoCol (as it should have been originally, IMO), or just add #promoCol2?<p>Maybe a column is a bad example as you might be able to deduce ahead of time that there MIGHT be more than 1.  But you could say that of just about any element on the page.  Theater was mentioned, but I've worked on sites where we had to add a second theater second to a page (yah...I know, wasn't my call.)<p>I would even go so far as to say, if you use IDs in any significant factor in your CSS, you are doing it wrong.  And it has absolutely nothing to do with knowing how to work specificity, and everything to do with the additional flexibility not using IDs provides you (or your co-workers) both during an initial build and down the line when maintaining or updating a project.",1331598936

If you are comparing throughput that <i>can</i> be a true statement (thought it's usually only true in devices where the limiting factor is the bandwidth of the connection to the host computer...).<p>Luiz was referring to the latency of individual operations.

> I had never heard this claimed before -- is this true? Wikipedia says:<p>The claim is very true.<p>At the level of a single flash chip, you can only do one operation at a time. So at any one time, a single chip can be doing exactly one of: erasing a block, writing a page, or reading a page.<p>Erasing a block
- Latency ~5-20ms depending on the generation of flash.
- On modern chips, a block will have between 64 & 256 4KiB or 8KiB pages.<p>Write a page
- Latency 400us - 4ms
- On SLC chips, the latency will be consistently in the 400us range
- On MLC, half of the pages in a block will see 400us latency, the other half will be in the 3ms-4ms range
- Writes can only be performed on erased pages.<p>Read a page
- Latency ~80-100us<p>SSDs achieve performance by putting together a lot of flash chips and trying to keep them all busy at the same time. The more the operations an SSD can do in parallel, the better off it will be. A (very) simplified way to think about it is to imagine that the SSD is a RAID0 controller that is talking to flash chips rather than disks. For simplicity, imagine the data is striped uniformly across the chip, so a read/write for logical address A will always end up on chip (A / page_size) % number_of_chips.<p>Imagine you have two apps:<p>The first app only reads from the SSD. As long as nobody else is writing to the device it will see very read latency. If the reads are perfectly distributed across the address range, it will see 100us latency consistently. In the real world, some reads will be targeted to the same chip, and will therefore have to wait for the preceding read to complete.<p>The first app is seeing:
Read - 100us latency
Read - 100us latency
Read - 200us latency (got stuck behind a previous read)
Read - 100us latency
Read - 100us latency
Everyone is happy.<p>Now imagine that another process wakes up and starts writing to the SSD.
The total latency for a write can vary greatly. If there is an erased page ready to go, the write operation will take ~400us. If the SSD needs to erase a page, it can be much higher. If there is an empty page that just needs to be erased the write operation will take (20ms + 400us). If the SSD needs to do garbage collection (i.e. copy data from one block to another to free up a block) the time could be much higher, possibly 50ms or higher.<p>App  Operation    Latency
A    Read chip 0  100us
B    Write chip 0 400us
A    Read chip 0  500us+
... or ..
A    Read chip 0  100us
B    Write chip 0 40ms
A    Read chip 0  40ms<p>So app A would see a 40ms/100us = 400x variance in read latency.",1331597923

3696345,comment,3694604,3695477,13,0,jf,,,"Reading the rant from John Rose in the preface to THE UNIX-HATERS Handbook [1] was pretty eye-opening to me. The world that John is complaining about is the world that I've spent many years living in, quite happily too!<p>How is it that we lost the ability to fix the code to a program that crashed, then continue running the program from where it left off? Why aren't all of our tools self-documenting? Etc, etc.<p>I've spent quite a bit of time wondering why we've ""lost"" so much. I think that part of the problem is that technology was developed a rate faster than what most people could keep up with. I remember that early Macs had a game to teach people how to use the mouse! Also, before the internet, it was hard for to transmit software and information about it.<p>So, the way I view the world of technology now is that we haven't ""lost"" anything, we're just catching up with the past. And doing a better job of it too!<p>In many ways, I think that the capabilities of ""HTML5"" (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) are converging on the capabilities of the X Window system. The main difference that I can see is that ""HTML5"" requires about 2-4 inches of book to understand while the X Windows System required a couple of feet of book to understand.<p>I'm not sure if my view of us just needing to catch up with the past is correct, but it's been pretty useful to me. Now, instead of bemoaning things that are lost, I look forward to seeing those things again, in a form that is easier to understand. More ""pure"" if you will.<p>I'm looking forward to the day when I can edit any part of my OS or applications, live, while they are running. I'm looking forward to being able to fix a program that has crashed and then have it continue running. I enjoy using interactive debuggers and I'm looking forward to seeing them in more languages. I love using REPLs to learn new languages and for doing quick prototyping.<p>That's why I'm watching JavaScript with interest. Many people are doing things with JavaScript that we were doing with Lisp Machines before. Some people are able to edit their server-side JavaScript live. Many of us know that our web browser has a built-in JavaScript REPL, some of us use that to fix webpages that other people wrote.<p>In short. After spending a lot of time reading, talking about, and using Lisp Machines, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of what William Gibson meant when he said ""The future is already here  it's just not very evenly distributed.""<p>Footnote:

I don't particularly want to start looking down at my screen. I suppose there could be an optimal angle of compromise - but, I have other reservations about using touch screens exclusively.<p>1. Keeping any one finger extended while keeping the rest off the screen is none to pleasant for me, whereas mice are pretty comfy to rest the hand on.<p>2. Being a female with somewhat longer nails, I find using touch pads and touch screens to be a nightmare in terms of accuracy. I know exactly where my mouse is and what it's going to activate when I click - I can't say the same for my finger nail getting in the way or the larger area of finger-pad that touches as a result of avoiding nail contact. I suppose this could be remedied with a stylus of some sort, but I'm also sad when my hand is in the way of viewing stuff around what I'm trying to manipulate. I've got some pretty slender hands, but this still leads to awkward wrist action trying to keep a finger on the screen and look at everything around it simultaneously.<p>3. The distance I cover with my mouse on the desk in order to move my pointer across three monitors is a fraction of the actual distance travelled by my pointer, so instead of sweeping my arm dramatically across a meter or so, I've flicked my wrist a few cm to achieve the same effect. But, when I move my mouse very slowly, I can still achieve pixel accuracy.<p>4. Unless screens develop the ability to change their texture and structure, there is just no screen substitute for the little grooves between the keys, home row extrusions, and physical feedback of my keyboard. I can rest my hands on the keyboard without worry because it takes a certain amount of pressure to activate the keys, and I know for certain when I have pushed a key, even if there is no immediate visual feedback. I can always look down to my keyboard and it reveals a good deal of it's functionality to me. It also never takes up any precious screen real estate and I don't have to do anything elaborate to bring it up.<p>5. Goodness, can you imagine how dirty my screens would get, so fast! Yuck. Finger prints and smudges everywhere.
But this is just my opinion and may be subject to change if better technologies come around. Presently I'm in no hurry to abandon my mouse & keyboard.<p>-edit for formatting.",1331597156

3696322,comment,3695546,3695778,8,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Agreed.  Imho this argument that copying is not stealing does a real disservice to the cause. No, you're not stealing a thing when you copy it, but you are stealing the utility that it confers, be it entertainment, knowledge or whatever, that you would otherwise have had to pay for. You're taking value and not compensating for it, aka theft.<p>This is so transparent and obvious a flaw in the assertion that no trained lawyer (aka lawmakers) will suffer it, and the non-torrenting general public will remain mostly unconvinced. And when the ultimate goal is to force the content industry to open up, to switch from a business model based on artificial scarcity to one based on abundance, this argument is only going to do more harm than good.<p>I think it would be much more productive to instead focus on the fact that the fundamental problem is that articifical-scarcity-creating, rent-seeking cartels like Hollywood and the music industry have no place in our emerging culture of digital abundance. That their attempt to maintain control of a resource, limit supply, and charge rents for access is increasingly only possible with government force.<p>Further, as Steve Blank observes [1], we've seen this same thing play out over and over throughout history, any time a new technology made content more easily distributable, the content cartels vigorously opposed it, until finally losing, being forced to adapt, and eventually making more money than previously.<p>There is a win-win-win way forward, that is just as if not more profitable, but it doesn't include things like DRM, DVD region codes, SOPA/PIPA, etc. Neither the content industry nor the current generation of lawmakers will be able to get us there, so it's up to those of us on the bleeding edge of technology and culture to, but making silly [2], easily-refuted arguments won't help at all.<p>1.  <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2012/01/04/why-the-movie-industry-cant-innovate-and-the-result-is-sopa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2012/01/04/why-the-movie-industry-cant...</a><p>2.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4</a>",1331597045

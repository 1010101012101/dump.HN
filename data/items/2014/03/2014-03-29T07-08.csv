The math has been a lot of work, I don&#x27;t have a strong math background.<p>The ability to get a US work visa is something that has worried me. I looked into this when I got approached about a job opportunity in the states a while ago, however it turns out I can&#x27;t work in the US without a degree, or 12 years experience. That said, I&#x27;ll have 12 years experience around about the same time I&#x27;d complete my degree, so it&#x27;s probably not really going to help with that.<p>I think your edit is actually pretty spot on, I probably need to worry less about finding a start-up that&#x27;s going to make it big and focus more on finding a problem that I can solve locally. The scale in NZ is quite small unfortunately, there are only 5m people here which is one of the reasons I figured I&#x27;d need to look overseas.. perhaps it just means there&#x27;s less competition?<p>Lots to think about - Maybe I&#x27;ll finish this semester and then spend the rest of the year working on one of my ideas and see where I get to, if I don&#x27;t have any luck I can continue my BSc next year while I come up with another idea.",1396079976

Our frontend is Model-View-Nothing with React for the view and TypeScript for everything else. We build with gulp, and avoid browserify because it makes debugging more difficult. Therefore, we generate a debug and a production build: the production build simply concats all generated JS, and the debug build keeps the separate JS files with source maps back to the .ts sources. We autogenerate the index.html.<p>Some of us code TypeScript in Visual Studio, which is awesome. Many just use a text editor and `gulp watch`, though, which works remarkably good as well. I wish there was good TypeScript IDE support on other platforms than Windows. The entire team has previous experience that makes them think strongly in terms of classes and object. TypeScript is a very natural fit for a team like this, and made us productive very fast. Prototypal inheritance, not so sure.<p>On the backend, we do C#, hosted on Linux with Mono (we have devs running Linux, Mac and Windows, we&#x27;re just as cross-platform as your average Python shop). We use ServiceStack v3 for the API and PostgreSQL for data. We heavily rely on stored procedures and Postgres-specific features (such as returning cursor sets instead of gigantic joins) for making the backend very lean and simple.<p>We use Docker for running stuff locally and in production. Our designers just run the backend docker containers locally with a single click (in Vagrant). They never installed Mono or Postgres anywhere.<p>Is that what you wanted to know?",1396078785

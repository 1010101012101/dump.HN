Many times I use iPad applications and wish they were available on the desktop. iPad applications especially I think can work very well on the desktop due to the large display.<p>But don't take my work for it.

There are A LOT of template companies out there (like digital juice), comping/editing for a user is a challenging task (and might be fun to make :)), but IMO if you could provide them with a layout tool for story structure, it would be a killer. Like that imovie thing mentioned. I purposely called it a layout tool, since you need only a basic structure to hold it through, not a full blown script (at least not for initial kickoff). I'm sure you've sen Syd Field's workshops and stuff like that.<p>If you could hook up with some template guys (to cut down costs of making them yourself - both money and time wise), maybe hook up with guys like dramatica to devise a simpler version of structure process, and you do the tech part for comp/editing... you'd have something that nobody currently has, and online...

Because that's a bit..er far fetched.<p>I feel I don't understand it - can you explain it a bit more? My first idea when I heard about consumer oriented MSAAS as you call it, was that you would provide them with guidelines about story structure (however simple it may be - because it can be made formulaic), offer them a slew of templates like digital juice and, on top of that, list them required material to be shot for a given project... and in the end you auto-magically comp and edit it with a sound sheet and they take of their product.",1300840792

That way as each friend drops their clip in they can view the whole and adjust their part.<p>Making the system modular so you could collaborate on a large movie would also be cool.<p>You could have an import tool that accepts a script as a text file. It finds definitions of characters, scenes, dialog, direction, etc.<p>It then breaks the script into acts, scenes, shots and creates the corresponding data-structures on your end to present same.<p>You then use chunks of dialog as placeholders for the rendered imagery and presto, instant placeholder movie. Author then replaces dialog with storyboards, early renders, then finished content.<p>It could be truly social, like a movie creation wiki with many users. Each user might have different permissions to edit, add content for (some subset of) scenes, etc.",1300840753

Brains, you see, work in strangely similar ways to that of other muscles in your body. You can certainly get ""quick fix"" improvements, but over the long term, they will never, ever get anywhere close to organic incremental gains built under exercise, and regularly pushing your limits.<p>However, just like with body building, there are instruments for accelerating this growth:<p>-Lumosity (www.lumosity.com) is to brain building what a bench press is to muscle improvements. In a 30-minute daily session, your brain is exposed to 5 different games, each exercising general brain plasticity, and specific muscles (speed, flexibility, memory, whatever you think you could use). I'm using this for 2 months now straight, and their pricing is terribly, terribly off compared to the returns I'm getting.<p>-If Lumosity is for building the general hardware, Spaced repetition is the enabler for installing software for long-term instant recall. Supermemo, or other SR products can help; specific areas usually have their own SR solution already.<p>-Language: of all the disciplines I've sucked up so far, nothing has changed my mind, and worked on my brain more, than acquiring a new language (preferably from a conceptionally different linguistic branch -eg. I'm learning Japanese; Chinese could also prove to be profitable in the near future)<p>Hope this gets you started, and feel free to ask any questions (my e-mail's in my profile)",1300840410

We have been discussed in TechCrunch, The Wall Street Journal, ABCNews.com, LifeHacker, WalletPop, The Christian Science Monitor, CNET, Slate, NYTimes.com, etc.<p>We facilitate hundreds of ebook loans every day. Our users indicate the books they would like to lend or borrow and the system matches the lend and borrow requests and prompts the lender through the loan process on Amazon's site.<p>We make money from sales commissions through the Amazon Associates program and through display and email advertising, including sponsorships by independent authors and publishers. The startup is already bringing in respectable revenue.<p>In our market, the big news of the day today is that another Kindle lending site, Lendle.me, lost access to the Amazon API. Many are speculating that Amazon revoked the API in order to put an end to Kindle lending.  However, the reality is that although BookLending.com is the largest Kindle lending platform by a substantial margin, we have had uninterrupted API access and do not expect that to change. I can discuss this at greater length with qualified candidates.<p>At this point, we're exploring incubator/seed funding and I'm ready to find the right full-time North America-based (West Coast ideal) technical co-founder. MUST be available full-time once seed funding is in place. Must be able to relocate for minimum three months to any major city in North America.<p>The ideal cofounder can develop quickly and competently in a LAMP environment.  Familiarity with Amazon, Facebook and Twitter APIs would be a real asset.  Agile development experience would also be good. If you have leadership experience, tell me about it. We have identified a number of priorities for further development, and I want to find someone who will take a keen interest in product development to contribute to generating ideas, planning, prioritizing as well as taking the lead on execution. Proven dedication to excellence is essential. A love of books is a tremendous plus.<p>Why I'm a good cofounder for you:  I've already proven that I can lead a team and bring a successful product to market that generates tons of media coverage and word of mouth.  I have extensive online marketing experience with paid traffic, search engine optimization and social media, and although I do not code, I have several years of project management experience in PHP/MySQL custom development. I am familiar with HTML and I can build MySQL queries to gather data from our database.  I keep learning. I don't expect software to do things automagically, and if you want someone with whom to discuss the pros and cons of one approach over another, I can offer an ear. I am gutsy and I am not afraid to reach out to people who can help grow the business; I love talking to people. I have an unwavering commitment to this startup.  I'm unflappable, and I laugh a lot.  When adversity hits, I suck it up and figure out how to turn it to our advantage.  I love books and I understand our market.<p>Equity in the company - terms to be discussed.<p>If you are interested, you are bound to have many more questions. Please contact me (include LinkedIn/Blog/Twitter links) at catherine@booklending.com and if you appear to be a potential fit I will contact you to discuss further. If you feel like this could be a startup you would love to be involved with and you have the skills it needs, I want to hear from you.<p>Catherine MacDonald - catherine@booklending.com<p>[thanks to this post http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2332349 for providing a great example of a ""looking for a technical co-founder"" listing]",1300839728

Like I said above, thats like 250 NYC's.

Now I'm just wondering how useful those venues are.  (I am also pretending that Yelp has better than 10% coverage of venues that users care about).

Would love if someone could corroborate/dispute this fact.\nWhile there is certainly a disparity between the two and Yelp, I'd imagine that the ""useful"" venues (those that people want recommendations for) aren't your home or rainapololypse2011.

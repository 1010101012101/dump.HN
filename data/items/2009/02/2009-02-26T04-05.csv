495445,comment,495053,495216,0,0,trominos,,,"I agree, and I think that the solution is simple: limit people's ability to give out upvotes. Maybe restrict people's weekly upvotes to c * ln(karma) + d or something. (Make d small!) Or have upvotes actually cost you like a tenth of a karma point. (Dunno if karma should be turned into currency, though, since then I could imagine people trying to game the system.)<p>This solves another problem that really bothers me: an upvote to a really insightful comment (like the parent) has the same weight as an upvote to a comment that's merely useful, or, worse, that merely shares my feelings on some topic. Insight (in my opinion) should always count for more than anything else, and I think limiting upvotes will make it so -- because I think most people actually do care about it most.<p>- EDIT - 
Another (even more dire, IMO) problem that might have a similar solution: comment threads are way too long. Only four or five months ago I could make a comment and I'd be absolutely certain that at least a few reasonable people would read it, and so it never felt like luck when my comments moved up; my good comments inevitably got upvotes, and my mediocre comments stayed where they were. Now comments get lost in the wash. I'm tacking this edit onto this comment partially because it's tangentially relevant, but mostly because I don't have faith that anybody will ever see it otherwise.<p>That's a <i>huge</i> problem, and I suspect that it is in fact the fundamental cause of the degeneration of other social news sites. When people know that their contributions will be noted, they act like they're participating in a conversation. When the success of a comment depends on a metaphorical die roll, I think people adopt the mentality of, ""I'll throw shit at the wall and see what sticks.""<p>My solution would be to limit weekly ""root"" comments (comments that respond directly to a submission, not to other comments) with a formula similar to the one above (c ln(karma) + d), though with the caveat that comments that get more than a few upvotes get ""refunded."" But frankly I'd endure any kind of unreasonable limitation if it would get rid of the feeling that this community is gradually but inexorably turning into a mob.",1235622702

Especially if each community develops its own unique character.  I've thought about organizing each community onto branches of a B-tree and letting upvoted submissions move up the tree, though my intuition says that this might not scale, as one community might overpower the rest.<p>Anyway it would be interesting if someone builds it.",1235621046

script can create a ""screencast"" of any terminal session.  This works pretty well, but probably is not the right solution for the education market pg is talking about :-)",1235620995

I can't even tell for sure if the guy that started the thread works for Opera.<p>Second, right now each and every one of the web browsers available has some very stupid problems: Firefox 3 still uses silly amounts of memory, and can't even correctly scroll Reddit pages with lots of comments; Safari is only lukewarm, not customizable, has its own compliance quirks (some versions have a JS bug which will <i>crash</i> <i>it</i>), and isn't especially remarkable in terms of performance; and then there's Internet Explorer.<p>Opera at least is making an effort, and with fewer resources at hand than either Mozilla or Apple.

Founders are yeoman project managers at best, engineers are less than that-- not even able to raise a family in the Valley-- and even the venture capitalists are, for the most part, merely junior elite.<p>I'm not so sure about that claim, anyway, given that IQ is relative. The intellectual edge of the modern elite is quite thin, by historical standards.<p>The upper-class average IQ is generally held to be in the upper 100s-- no higher than 110-- even if class is defined to include social connections, respectability, and educational pedigree in addition to income.<p>So the upper class is only about 0.5-0.7 standard deviations smarter than the general population. That's not that much. They're also a small elite: less than 0.1% is running the world. For every Davos Man, there are 10,000 people wanting to see him fall. In any pool of that size, there are some fiercely smart people.<p>Compare that to the medieval elite, which had superior nutrition by far. They had what would be close to average height and intelligence today. Charlemagne (Charles the Great) was considered a giant. He was about 6 feet tall. Average people were a foot shorter, and were probably at an IQ level around 70-75.",1360421368

And, it's also interesting (but hardly surprising) that most of the comments are blindly for meritocracy.<p>Yeah - meritocracy sounds great in principle.  And, we can agree that it's leagues better than aristocracy.  But, over generational scales, aristocracy and meritocracy are very closely aligned.<p>Meritocracy begins first with a wave of smart, risk-taking, hard-working, uncompromising, (perhaps immoral) people who usurp the establishment.  And, we certainly celebrate that.  It brings a shift, and usually rewards many others.<p>But, it's when those same people put their children and grandchildren in positions where risks nearly vanish that we worry about.  They naturally give their descendents their connections, secret knowledge, wealth, safety and other benefits.  And, they unconsciously change the rules to favor themselves.  And, they seem to dismiss all those elements when their spawns happen to reach similar heights.  And, slowly, they begin to believe that it's some genetic component, or something innate in them, that has caused it.  And, then the new aristocracy is born.<p>I think the article is bringing attention to this, and it's good to do so.  The new rich should be allowed to let their children and grandchildren live great lives.  But, those descendents should not become the gatekeepers of the rest of the world's amazing talent.

A good surgeon can make 3-4x a poor surgeon. A good programmer can make 2-3x a poor programmer. If you are a fantastic programmer and you make $50k/yr in US, it means either (1) you don't care about money (2) you don't know how to negotiate. There is no way a fantastic programmer is going to be stuck at 50k in the US today. A poor programmer can end up with a 100k salary through connections/seniority etc. but more often than not, most of them are in the 35k-65k range.<p>It is entrenched because only those on the top can afford to pay for good education for their children so they can become good in their professions. Doctors can afford to send their kids to top tier private-schools and Ivy League universities, which means their kids have a better shot at being a good doctor or engineer learning under Nobel Laureates compared to the kids of auto-mechanics and park rangers, whose teachers might not have the best credentials.<p>What I would agree with you on, is that this isn't too different from the past when children of top ranking military generals got better training and ended up being better soldiers and generals than the children of farmers and blacksmiths.

If however you believe that the state do not own the land, then the land is a property of the individual that work it, builds on it, lives on it.<p>Its an illusion to think that just because one can barter with privileges, it suddenly become a property and all the economics regarding property will suddenly make it all right. Its false. You can't turn privileges given by the state into something it isn't and what it isn't is a property owned by the individual.",1360420820

5192614,comment,5188518,5191084,2,0,vy8vWJlco,,,"(Apologies in advance for using your comment as an excuse to unload a diatribe.)<p>I would argue that it has become as much, at least at a high level (as another poster noted, the laws and precedents were less defined when TPB and others actually opened, and many people feel entitled to private copying irrespective of TPB). The basic claim of anyone sharing files is simply that they have a right to share them, including the copyrighted ones. It just happens to be the copyrighted ones that are contentious. I think the sentiment boils down to ""would you steal a loaf of bread if you were broke?"" (Yup. I know it's ""wrong,"" but I'm no good to anyone dead...) One can debate the morality, but we can have machines bake bread (execute the bread algorithm) with minimal human intervention, and we have digital machines to make copies of information and entertainment at the user's own expense, so it's a pretty weak argument that the world should simply starve or go without; surely the utility from a fed person exceeds the cost of stolen bread today (<i>if it doesn't, why doesn't it? have we really failed so greatly? why should we not simply act together so that bread is abundant enough that it can be donation-ware? production can be completely automated... we have to solve these problems some time, or we might as well admit we want everyone to suffer open-endedly - though we seem to be choosing exactly that through licensing models, SaaS, and digital library loans that expire...</i>). Entertainment is not bread though (and copying is not theft), but entertainment is culture, and the cost of leaving people out IMHO also exceeds the ""cost"" of non-commercial sharing. These are all highly contentious and subjective interpretations, but as a whole society, we are pressed right up against that glass; it's easier to produce and distribute, yet we have to raise prices and enforce restrictions on permuting all the good ideas <i>because we all have to pay the prices that reflect those behaviors.</i> (IMHO, simply removing or phasing out that assumption would let good ideas multiply, to the benefit of consumers, while simultaneously relieving the price pressure, to the benefit of producers. Capitalism at it's best.) In the present, there is immense pressure to constrain knowledge since it is highly leverage-able. It separates the haves from the have-nots. The have-nots, however, can <i>only</i> copy and steal bread; they have no surplus. (Should they be forced, at gun point, to leave an 18% tip too?) I'm not saying the wealthy are ""hoarding"" their surplus - I believe value is created out of nothing short of opportunity - rather, I'm simply saying that feeding someone allows them to thrive, which is a net social benefit and, as such, non commercial sharing should be tolerated if not encouraged. To be fed is to be able. It's not a new dynamic, but the specific subject is: data behave differently from bread... Copying is fast and non-exclusive, like ideas; as we become more connected, preventing copying becomes the same as preventing thought. That's why copyright infringement <i>has</i> become a focal point: subverting copyright allows people to communicate freely and, more importantly, to subvert our rigged economy, which I do think is held together by numerous unjust laws, of which IMHO copyright, in it's present form, is one.",1360420595

The questions he's raising definitely signal ""consultant"" but his price signals ""contractor"". The expertise he thinks he's being hired for is ""make my project successful"" (consultant) but is probably ""build this thing for me"" (contractor).<p>Consultant's generally have to spend a lot of time persuading their customers to follow their advice, and charge high rates to make sure that they do. Contractors focus more on efficient delivery of their work, and let the customer sort out what to do with it.<p>Note that I'm using the titles consultant and contractor in their extremes.

Non-believers often underestimate the intellectual sophistication that one can find in religious traditions.<p>For instance, Augustine in the 4th century was already saying things like this:<p>""With the scriptures it is a matter of treating about the faith. For that reason, as I have noted repeatedly, if anyone, not understanding the mode of divine eloquence, should find something about these matters [about the physical universe] in our books, or hear of the same from those books, of such a kind that it seems to be at variance with the perceptions of his own rational faculties, let him believe that these other things are in no way necessary to the admonitions or accounts or predictions of the scriptures.""<p>And C.S.

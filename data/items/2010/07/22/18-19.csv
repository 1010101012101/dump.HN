And for practice, make a note when others do it as well. You'll learn to distinguish air-tight arguments from sloppy ones. It also helps to use a mental filter to call yourself out before anyone else can. Here are things that help me:<p>1/. State an argument. Then, take the opposite side - ask yourself, what are the arguments people might have against my argument? What assumptions am I making? Is what I am saying true in all cases or only under specific circumstances?<p>2/.

Two quotes from Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner), that also act like a filter:<p><i>""You are not entitled to an opinion unless you can state the arguments against your opinion better than your opponents can.""</i><p>and from an interview:<p><i>Q: You've often said that one of the keys to your success has simply been to avoid making the garden-variety mistakes that you see other people make.<p>Munger: Warren and I have skills that could easily be taught to other people. One skill is knowing the edge of your own competency. It's not a competency if you don't know the edge of it. And Warren and I are better at tuning out the standard stupidities. We've left a lot of more talented and diligent people in the dust, just by working hard at eliminating standard error.</i>",1279825093

Graduate students earn very little money, but don't become obese.

Any service is offered under <i>some</i> terms; it's irrational and unreasonable to assume that when you use someone's website or service that there are no terms whatsoever attached to that service.<p>So where do those terms come from?  Rationally, one might expect the website to spell out what they expect from you and under what conditions their services are provided.  If you don't like those terms, don't use the service.<p>It seems like you're arguing that <i>you</i> should get to determine under what terms the services are offered, or perhaps alternatively that services offered should never have any terms attached whatsoever; both of those positions seem pretty indefensible to me.<p>Just because you don't get a chance to negotiate terms doesn't make them invalid.  It's a take-it-or-leave it offer, and you always have the right to leave it.  When a restaurant gives you a bill, do you pay less than the amount just because you didn't get to negotiate the price?  Do you walk into a restaurant shirtless that explicitly asks you not to do that?  Of course not:  your ordering the item indicated your willingness to pay the associated charge, and likewise if you don't want to abide by their rules around appropriate dress, you just don't go in.<p>You don't get to make up your own rules and then apply them to someone else's services.<p>It's a different question if the TOS are deliberately obscured such that you don't actually know what you're agreeing to, but the argument that just because you can't negotiate the TOS they're somehow invalid and you're thus justified in still using the service in violation of them is absurd.",1279824207

Radically slim down your app to do and show only the bare neccessities, the core, the meat of your service. From there, you can always slowly start to expand the feature base as long as you remember that it will never be the extra features that get you your users, it is the core that matters.<p>I strongly suggest you to(at least temporarily) remove: Display of people online, all the sorting buttons, the red in yellow notification, the need to sign up or login, the amount of views per post. Next to each post, only show amount of viewers, don't discriminate between guests or users.<p>After you have done this, start working on color-schemes, and read online guides on typography to make the interface less confusing and complex. Make sure a visitor's eye is drawn towards important elements, and that less important elements are in the background more ( smaller, less bright typography/elements).<p>2. If realtime Digg is not unique, why create one? It doesn't matter if it's unique or not, as long as your users get what you are offering them. ""Interact with Others"" is a slogan that could apply to \nan alcoholics anonymous group or a dating website. What does your website do that is appealing to me, in a maximum of 5 words?<p>3.

Like other business applying this model (Gilt, RueLaLa, JackThreads, OneKingsLane, etc), you have to be a member to get access to the sales. Once you are a member, you get regular emails announcing new deals. Consumer brands give us VERY discounted merchandise to get rid of overstock (not defectives, just excess inventory) and to gain exposure/loyalty in a new market.<p>The challenge in building that MVP is that a flash sales site requires a minimum set of features by definition (e.g., limited access, access to inventory, a minimum member base). The Magento private sales module is only available in the Enterprise Edition ($13k). We couldn't find any SaaS options that satisfied the minimum requirements.<p>Now we wanted to build a real MVP, not do a dry test (http://yongfook.com/mvp-vs-dry-test). This means that we needed to actually build something that works, not just a landing page with an email collection form. To do this, we needed to work on 3 fronts at the same time:<p>IT: we built the site using the Magento community edition, bought a couple of cheap plugins and customized the rest inhouse. As you see, we are weak on the design side (working on that now with a pro) and we have a long way to go to make it a . But that's the point of a MVP.<p>Products to sell: we signed up over 50 brands and are in discussions with many more. This part requires getting on the phone and making calls all day long. There is no easy way around it. We called several hundreds brands to get to the 50 we have. It's hard work but it's worth it. We learned so much about the industry by doing this work (we are not industry insiders).<p>Customers: we invited all our friends, asked them to invite their friends and experimented with Facebook ads. We have content on the front page that is bringing us decent traffic.<p>The products and customers portions are a classic chicken-and-egg/marketplace problem. It is difficult to attract lots of customers to your site if you have nothing to sell. At the same time, how do you convince brands to give you significant discounts on the wholesale pricing if you don't have the user base to justify it? It's been a difficult process for us but we are starting to see the results now.<p>I would love to get feedback from you on our MVP.<p>If you are a student and are interested in getting deals (up to 80%) on apparel, ipod accessories, etc, please consider joining and telling your friends about us :)",1279821757

Read a little bit and then infer a lot from it. To reduce being called out on something, explain how to jump from point A to point B. This actually serves 2 purposes.<p>1) Reduce the chances of someone jumping on you because they think you are a BSer based on your history of BSing.<p>2) Enhances your thought process because you become aware of errors in your thought process when you are called out.<p>Ultimately #2 is most important. When you are called out or corrected, you gain insight not simply in your own thinking process, but how the person in your conversation thinks as well. Listening to your criticisms and implementing them into your thought process to correct for them in the future makes you seem way more credible and increases your ability to infer in the future.",1279821736

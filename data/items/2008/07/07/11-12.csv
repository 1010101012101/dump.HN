238502,comment,237904,238452,0,0,rkts,,,"I agree.  As with ""OOP,"" the term ""functional programming"" is too broad to be the subject of a meaningful discussion about language design.  It's better to break the term down into its sub-concepts, which are often independent of each other.<p>I question whether the notion of ""programming paradigms"" should exist.  The more powerful a language is, the less I seem to notice paradigms in my code.  I can't point to a piece of Lisp code and say, ""this code is functional,"" or ""this code is imperative,"" or whatever.  I just use the tools that are most appropriate for what I'm trying to do.<p>Paradigms are like design patterns in this respect; they only seem to arise in languages whose weaknesses force you to write code a certain way.  I think ""multi-paradigm"" languages like Lisp and OCaml would be better described as ""no paradigm,"" and this is how languages ought to be.",1215431444

Photos are just one of the things everyone wants to share. Without it, Facebook would have a giant hole for a competitor to attack.<p>Facebook profits by having the most active and connected users.

4980038,comment,4976381,4977157,2,0,cmccabe,,,"Destroying locality makes the program very difficult to read for anyone other than the person who wrote it.  I've been there before and done that.  I've written Z80 assembly code where functions had more than one entry point as well as exit point.  Sometimes I didn't bother to keep a stack at all.  Spaghetti code.  I was proud of it at the time.  Not so much now.<p>My understanding of Corotwine and greenlet is that they're basically poor man's threads.  Basically, if the language doesn't give you usable threads, you can go ahead and implement your own.  I've done that one too-- I once wrote an M:N threading library in userspace.  Basically making a small number of kernel threads look like a large number of threads to the programmer.<p>The problem with rolling your own threads is that the normal tooling that comes with the language won't know how to handle what you built.  There is no syntax for your add-on, and the semantics may be murky at best.  Stack traces become useless, and error messages become guru meditations.  Interfacing with third party libraries becomes a challenge, unless they're designed to be purely single threaded.<p>Additionally-- how to put this delicately?  Something as fundamental as threads should not be built as an add-on to a programming language.  Things built on top of a language tend to be very fragile and buggy compared to things built in to a language.  The C programming language was designed before threads were even a thing in UNIX, so lacking threads was understandable.  We built our own threading packages because we had to.  But you shouldn't need to do that for a modern language.",1356735542
4980037,comment,4977935,4978506,1,0,Arelius,,,"> The reason has to do with weight transfer. Your car's traction at each end is determined by the amount of weight. When you accelerate, you decrease traction up front and you increase traction in the rear. Lifting off throttle increases front end traction and decreases rear end traction, a little. Hitting the brakes massively decreases rear end traction and massively increases front end bite.<p>While this contributes to the effect, it's does not properly represent what's actually going on. Generally speaking, you want to perform action that normalizes the speed of the tires and the wheels, as you said, this is basically never breaking because wheels are good at slowing themselves down. If the slide is caused by slow tires, or if the tires have time to slow while the slide is happening (The most common case, and also the one that is caused by hitting the e-brake) Then indeed, as you said applying gas is the proper action. But compare this to a slide caused by wheel-spin due to too much gas, Any additional application of gas will just make the problem worse.<p>Having said that, if you do find yourself in a slide caused by too much gas, hitting the brakes will almost always make it worse, instead lightening up on the gas, and then slowly reapplying tends to be the most effective strategy.",1356735536

Many organizations don't have engineers who really care about usability over functionality, so simply ""handing off high level wants"" just doesn't work outside of a couple of rehabbed buildings in Frisco.<p>It's easy to have a reference to the Stripe article, where there are no PMs.  But, this environment is the exception rather than the rule.  After working in a few medium sized places, the ratio of engineers who place an equal level of detail on usability & functionality vs those that place a higher value on functionality/architecture is easily 1:6.  And  you can guess which ones are usually the Sr members.  To their line of thinking, usability isn't something they have ever had to worry about.<p>I do agree with a previous poster that this is something that the startup culture is starting to change, but I would bet that this change won't be visible at most organizations until at least 5 - 8 years out as the engineer talent changes.<p>Now, I would say this problem is something that can be changed with some UX standards.  The PM creates flowcharts and/or wireframes of the proposed solution > hands it over to the agile team > dev + ux discuss any flows that fall outside of established standards.  As a PM myself, I would love this.  To be required to only provide more end user/market requirements as needed would be ideal.<p>One issue with this is that usually with organizations that have these issues, the investment just isn't there in the area of UX (I sit here reflecting on my current situation).<p>I will bet that the product team disfunction mentioned in the article is directly reflected in said team's products.  :)",1356734288

All night the conversation fluttered around nappies and toddler-proofing houses and more stuff about dealing with baby poo and vomit and whatnot.<p>On the one hand, it's fine, because these are new sets of parents using a pressure release valve, but on the other hand, it's screamingly boring because I've had to deal with the exact same conversation with new parents throughout my life. Try and change the topic and it comes back to baby vomit on the car seats or how the cat doesn't deal well with fistfuls of fur pulled out of her. It's not socially acceptable to indicate that it's boring to be in this conversation yet again - because to <i>these</i> parents, <i>these</i> kids are special.

Still no details about what the 2008 FISA Amendments Act actually said.<p>Next graf: invocation of Dick Cheney (the Democrats controlled the US Senate when the FISA Amendments Act passed, and Jay Rockefeller is no political ally of Cheney's; evidence for Cheney's actual input in the act: zero). Still no details about what the 2008 FISA Amendments Act actually said.<p>Next graf: multiple misrepresentations about the purpose of the FISA court and the conduct the Bush administration conducted that provoked outrage. Still no details about the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which, contra the actual text of the article so far, specifically forbids the government from intentionally targeting American persons or persons residing in America.<p>Next graf: dishonestly conflates Wyden's proposals for increased accountability with Paul's showboating attempt to rewrite all existing rules regarding electronic communications to exempt any such communications stored in Google; in other words, foreign powers would be immune from spying so long as they used GMail.<p>Next graf: begins with ""consider how modest these amendments are"". Continues with suggestions that all the amendments he's mentioned are reasonable and well-thought-out. Note again here that Wyden himself didn't offer an amendment that required warrants for foreign intelligence or individualized suspicion for programmatic intercepts.<p>Next graf: still not having directly explained any of the contents of the 2008 FISA Amendments bill, Greenwald predictably fails to mention that the NSA is already forbidden by that bill from surveilling US targets when he mentions Wyden's bill requiring warrants for surveillance of US targets. Here Greenwald again carefully lawyers the words ""US Soil"" to implicate the idea that the NSA is spying on Americans. Merkley's amendment, ""modest"" by clear implication, suggests that a court whose purpose is to ensure that spies are spying on foreign targets and not Americans should be compelled to release the details on American spying to the public.<p>Next graf: no problems, straightforwardly confirms that the Administration opposes amendments that would have the net effect of immediately halting in-process foreign surveillance operations.<p>Next graf: Dianne Feinstein is now ""conservative-Democratic"" despite 100% ratings from reproductive rights groups, environmental groups, the Human Rights Campaign, arts groups, and, according to Votesmart, an 87% score from the ACLU. Why? because Feinstein supports something Greenwald opposes, falling into his no-true-Scotsman trap.<p>Next graf: Obama relied on Republicans (the ""root of all evil"") for an act that passed overwhelmingly.<p>Next graf: the 2008 FISA Amendments act, which Greenwald still hasn't discussed in detail, is now a ""massive increase"" in the government's surveillance powers, when in fact by statute it limits those powers; the ""massive increase"" comes from statutory authority to conduct programmatic surveillance of foreign nationals without individual findings for each person involved, a detail you can count on Greenwald not to share with you.<p>Next two grafs are quotes, but check your wallet after reading them.<p>Next graf: the 2008 FISA bill is flawed (sure), and Obama demands its renewal ""without a single change"". No: Obama failed to support any of the amendments offered for the bill, which is obviously not the same thing as a refusal to entertain any changes to the act at all.<p>Next graf: Rand Paul's ""modest"" amendment to the PATRIOT act, which would have exempted gun dealers (and nobody else) from PATRIOT-motivated subpoenas. Greenwald doesn't take the time to tell you what this amendment was because he would sound stupid explaining that in late December 2012. Also: Harry Reid is Dick Cheney.<p>Next two grafs are quotes.<p>Next graf: ""if you try to debate the PATRIOT act"", for instance by proposing a last-minute amendment exempting gun dealers from subpoenas in terrorism investigations, Reid suggests you support the terrorists.

I'll disclose that I've known Adam personally for the past few years and I know you've only got this blog post to get to know him. I'd first like to say that Adam is one of the half dozen of MBAs in Boston I know quite well that do have the ""humility and willingness to learn"". I'm not sure how you don't get this feeling when Adam IS in fact blogging, tweeting, hustling into a VC role and early startup, connecting others in the community and learning every day (both at HBS and outside the classroom). It's rare, at least my in experience, to find an MBA so engaged in the flow of the tech community. 
I agree with you that the stage of the company one is entering is sometimes a strong barrier to entry though I sometimes think folks like yourself forget that it's not the MBA label or title that truly matters. For the best folks, it's simply a new skill set, network and experience they've gained. This is layered onto the respective individual's natural personality, network and skill set. 
Assuming the MBA title didn't go to their head (ie drive and humility remains the same), I would find a smart 25 yr old 25 yr old with an HBS degree (and all intangibles that come with it) more attractive for an early hire than the standard smart 25 yr old who simply had an extra full year of work experience. Similarly, just as many employers in the startu 
While I'm just a ugrad at the moment, not intent on getting an MBA, I have deep respect for many of my friends and colleagues here in town going to Sloan, HBS, etc. I'd recommend looking into the backgrounds and great things current MBA's like @besvinick, @jamesIII, @parulia, @jdraschil, @nickpatrick, @kylejudah and various others.

4979911,comment,4977889,4978577,6,0,mikeash,,,"In my experience, native speakers make a distinctly different class of mistakes from non-native speakers. Non-native speakers almost always learn the language formally in some sort of class, with a book and a curriculum. The mistakes tend to be simple memory failures, or incorrect analogies with their native languages. For example, a French-speaking person might say ""rape the cheese"" because ""rape"" is how you say ""grate"" in French, and they've forgotten that it's a false friend. Chinese speakers will say ""he"" instead of ""she"" a lot (or vice versa), because spoken Chinese doesn't distinguish and they're not used to tracking the sex of the subject. (Both totally real examples I've seen.)<p>Non-native speakers, on the other hand, learn the language informally, and they learn it spoken long before they learn it written. Really formal education in the language doesn't start until they're generally fluent. Thus you get mistakes like its/it's and your/you're and their/there/they're. Native speakers grew up with these as single words (it's all based on sound, after all!) and only later had to learn to distinguish them. Non-native speakers, on the other hand, were exposed to them as separate words from the start, and so don't typically mix them up.",1356733162

4979902,comment,4979183,4979183,2,0,natnat,,,"I think this has a lot less to do with taxes than it does with the prices of real estate. Buying a house in California is prohibitively expensive for most people, which eats up a huge amount of everyone's disposable income. In Texas, you make less money, but houses and rent are a factor of 2-4 times cheaper for what you get.<p>I think there are two main reasons for this: proposition 13 and CEQA. Prop 13 keeps property taxes really low, which makes buying and holding onto single-family homes really cheap. This is a giant subsidy for people who have lived in California for a while, but jacks up the prices for everyone else who gets in after them, since low ownership costs translate to high upfront prices.<p>The California Environmental Quality Act has a different effect that also raises housing prices: empowering NIMBYs. Because any new development can be pretty easily be slowed down/made more expensive/stopped altogether by a bogus CEQA request, new housing isn't getting built in nearly as much as one would expect given the demand. This makes existing housing more valuable, which increases prices even more.<p>In addition, some municipalities, notably San Francisco, have an insanely regulated rental market that makes renting incredibly difficult for a landlord, which makes it more attractive for people to buy housing instead of rent. This means there's less rental housing to go around, which makes the rent in SF absolutely insane.",1356733084

In Ohio, Obama's victory can be partly attributed to his success in getting the black population to vote at a <i>higher</i> rate than the white population (a highly unusual phenomenon) by using gathering places in black communities, such as barbershops and beauty salons, as local campaign branches.

There's so much downside, yet on the whole its not something you regret, <i>once you make the transition</i>. All generalizations are false, yet biologically we are made to sexually reproduce.

It doesn't work that way. Having said that, I am reminded of something my adoptive mother told me before she died. Having spent a couple of decades in a very active community of older people, she found the ones without children the saddest. ""They don't have anybody,"" she'd say sadly. Yes, they might have had a great life where they accomplished much and did all they wanted to do, they might even have a Rolodex full of friends, but at the end, there was nobody left for them. There were no replacements or people to carry on their memory long after they were gone. There was a deep loneliness and an empty spot as they socialized with others and enjoyed their last days. This was something others could notice. This was something most of them admitted to feeling.<p>Take that for what it's worth --- probably not a lot.

I have a 10 year old step-daughter who I have been raising since she was 3 and a 3 year old son.<p>For me, hands down, the most important thing I have done is try my hardest to maintain a solid, loving relationship with my wife. Without inspiring each other to be better parents, without the support we provide to each other, we could never flourish as parents/professionals/etc.<p>Things definitely get better as they get older. When they are able to entertain themselves, are no longer attached to your hip 24/7, it is much easier to start finding time for hobbies, side-projects, etc.. Of course a balance needs to be found here - you don't want to miss out on quality-time with your kids.<p>Going to bed/getting up early can add a few extremely productive hours to your day. I find that pretty much nothing productive happens for me after 9:00 PM. Of course, that's just me and plenty of people find late night hours very productive.<p>Try your best to stay healthy. Diet and exercise are often put on the back burner when times get busy. It can be tempting to skip sleep in favor of getting a few extra hours in. When it comes down to it though, if you're a mess you will not be effective.<p>I've found it useful to have friends with similar interests that have children. I'm not sure if this is widely applicable or not. I started raising my daughter when I was 22 and it was a very sudden change from care-free recent college grad to parent with a ton of responsibility, so I lost many of my friends as I struggled to find balance among my overwhelming responsibilities.

People born around 1980 and later are much more likely to express a desire for a real urban environment, like that found in San Francisco, New York, and throughout Europe, instead of the suburban environment favored by their parents.  Now, far be it from me to judge anyone, but it seems to me that anyone leaving California for Nevada is clearly expressing their preference for the suburban or even rural lifestyle.  That lifestyle, being extremely energy intensive, is the definition of non-sustainable.  If other states are attracting residents because they have lots of that unsustainable development, I think they can pretty much have as many of those people as they want.  I far prefer to see California investing in real cities, attracting the kinds of people who prefer to live in those real cities, and building a future that actually has a future.<p>It won't be very long (certainly within fifty years) before non-places like Las Vegas and Phoenix are viewed as bizarre, obvious mistakes of our past.",1356732197

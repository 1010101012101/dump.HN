10564368,comment,10546588,10549765,0,0,jgruber,,,"My take here is not about magic ARM dust. I do remember the magic RISC dust days -- and I, as a lover of the elegant -- was on the losing side of that one. I think the basic threat to Intel and x86 is this:<p>- Intel operates as a high-margin business. Their CPUs aren&#x27;t $10 components, and they don&#x27;t really have any serious competition. The whole point of the word &quot;Wintel&quot; was that all the value in a PC was going to Microsoft (for the OS) and Intel (for the CPU). These mobile ARM chips aren&#x27;t like that at all. They&#x27;re just another component in the device, like the camera and the display.<p>- Scale. Ben Evans makes the case well here: <a href=""http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/11/7/mobile-ecosystems-and-the-death-of-pcs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/11/7/mobile-ecosyste...</a> . He writes:<p>&quot;And fourth, the broader scale advantage - the ARM/iOS/Android ecosystem is moving towards selling 10x more devices each year than the Wintel ecosystem. That&#x27;s a similar disparity to that between PowerPC/Mac and Wintel 20 years ago.&quot;<p>I realize too that running a benchmark like GeekBench on iOS is not apples-to-apples running it on Mac OS X. But even if it&#x27;s not the case that the iPad Pro is a faster computer than a MacBook, it&#x27;s  close. But I really do think it&#x27;s faster -- it shows in browser-based benchmarks, which I think are a fair comparison even across iOS and OS X.<p>But in short: Intel doesn&#x27;t want to (and possibly can&#x27;t) compete on price, and they can&#x27;t compete on scale. Neither of those things are magic.",1447473306

Unfortunately, when oppressed people overcome the power in place, bad things happen as the results of the change in the balance of powers. IMHO this is similar to what happened when Bolsheviks took over the tsars and Communist Chinese put down the Emperor. I am of course not condoning violence (I am French and still in shock with what just happened) but I think these examples are sometimes more a sign of the people getting rid of hundreds (thousands) years of oppression than a particular political alignment.

Usually, this is done by letting the state pick a winning ideology and suppress those who don&#x27;t adhere to it. This tends to ensure a level of homogeneity that makes violence obsolete.<p>A more moderate solution is to allow conflicting ideologies to exist as long as they don&#x27;t reach extremes. This is usually done through mass surveillance, which supposedly should be able to catch extremists before they act. Sadly, we&#x27;re still very far from Minority Report&#x27;s level of accuracy.<p>Alternatively, we could adopt a more reactive approach which would focus on reducing the gravity of such events rather than trying to prevent them.

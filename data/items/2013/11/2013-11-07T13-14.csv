For some others, like say - mining machine operator- you&#x27;d need a beefier formula that accounts for the fact of where the jobs are located.  In many(but not all) areas, the most diverse are the bigger cities.  Not going to find many mines in Chicago or New York.<p>That said, the veterinarian one surprised me a bit.  I&#x27;d be fascinated to read a deeper dive into it.  My suspected guess is that in rural areas, many veterinarians make &#x27;house calls&#x27;, and every resident has a -lot- of livestock, vs inner cities where one veterinarian can service a big chunk of the population.

6689279,comment,6688301,6689224,1,0,adrianwaj,,,"The main argument I heard against bitcoin from a Russian tycoon during the Cyprus shenanigans for bitcoin being a good store of value was that there was no quick way to liquidate large sums of bitcoin if you wanted to (I presume into some fiat currency for spending.) An interesting point: it wasn&#x27;t really about the currency losing value it was about liquidity. But the counter-thought is that it&#x27;s better having a store of value that one can&#x27;t spend than not having anything at all! At least time is on your side with bitcoin in terms of liquidity, it&#x27;s not with fiat if you look at capital controls on the increase. Capital controls are an issue especially if you want to move between countries. Anyone with $100mil+ and not in bed with government should move into bitcoin and get a good anonymizer .. the rest of us just get a free ride. Assume some goverment will then come after (if not those bitcoins) then you. And so the end game of bitcoins is when goverment ends up with most of them (or at least wanting them.)",1383832664

So although you are technically correct that there is a distinction, the spirit of the original one-line comment was that individual voters don&#x27;t have the power that organized interests do. I gave a practical example in which the interests of individuals are overshadowed by leverage that an employer has over those individuals. It&#x27;s a case in which a vague threat of &#x27;hey, you want a job don&#x27;t you?&#x27; turns into aggregating money into the hands of a few people who lobby (in the generic sense) politicians to support things that may be against the interests of the employees. Such is the game they play.<p>As to your last statement, largely it is the shareholders and executives who are the beneficiaries of the lobbying they do. You can argue that the employees are beneficiaries in the sense that they have a job, but that misses the point: the benefits of lobbying fall asymmetrically. Again, it&#x27;s a leverage thing. They leverage the desire of the little guy to have a job and raise his family and in turn reap huge rewards for the shareholders. So although you can say everyone benefits and gets what they want, the result is really a distortion of power and influence.",1383832327

It may come across as sour grapes as yes, we were demoted following Penguin 2, due to links built by an SEO agency in 2008 that we have tried (pre-pengiun) to have removed for years, despite passing a manual link review and having a manual penalty removed, the algorithm clearly has no discretion and re-penalised us for the same issue, however the fact remains that the largest brand, a household name, in our niche is engaging in far worse and at a much greater scale and continues to do so that has left them top of the pile for a huge number of very lucrative search terms.<p>Here is just a small sample of paid links, paid blog posts and article submissions clearly designed to manipulate the SERP&#x27;s that are no doubt paying huge dividends for them. Isn&#x27;t it about time Google stepped in and stopped these brands being so well protected, whether it be from manual or algorithmic penalties. We&#x27;ve been watching their dominance in the travel market for 2-3 years now and assumed that one day Google would take a look but so far nothing and now we are in a position where we are laying off staff due to factors outside of our control (and accepted by the search quality team), whilst the largest and most active spammy link buyers in our niche go from strength to strength.<p><a href=""http://www.heatheronhertravels.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heatheronhertravels.com/</a>    paid

Has the US government killed a bunch of your neighbors? Disappeared them?<p>Two arguments.
1) The signs are that we are eroding the legal safeguards that at least made it very difficult and very risky to do this. Now, however, dissidents (call them traitors if you will, that is your opinion) can be whisked to secure holding facilities the world over and subjected to torture, and it is technically legal. US citizens can be assassinated legallly. And now we hear that we have been watched for decades, illegally. Clapper commits perjury, but walks free. Torturers are given clemency, but Snowden is wanted for esponiage. All of this tells me that currently, our freedom is a facade, and soon even that will be able to be dispensed with.<p>2) You could subscribe to the view that we don&#x27;t need to be murdered or dissapeared, just convinced that keeping our mouths shut and our eyes on the TV are the safest option.

Namely the fact that pointwise multiplication of 2 fourier transformed functions is the same as convolution of the functions themselves.<p>What does this mean in practice? Let&#x27;s take a simple gaussian blur for images. A single output pixel is formed by overlapping the gaussian kernel on top of the image, multiplying then pointwise, then summing the result. Repeat for every pixels. What you can also do is take FFT of the gaussian kernel and multiply it with the FFT of the image and inverse transform and you will get the same result as actually calculating it for every point separately. Is this faster than doing it point by point? Depends on the blur radius.<p>You can do awesome things with this blazingly fast. As an example a simple water wave simulation can be made by simply taking a fourier transform, multiplying it with the dispersion relation of the water waves and then doing an inverse transformation. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTUztfD2pg0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTUztfD2pg0</a> Just like what is done here. Normally this convolution would take O(N^2) amount of operations where N is amount of vertices but with FFT it&#x27;s O(N log N).<p>FFT is for convolution what quicksort is for sorting. Imagine how limited would you be if all your sorts would take O(N^2) time. The examples I gave are quite limited in scope, going trough all the applications of convolution would take textbooks. It&#x27;s probably one of the most important concepts in electrical engineering.<p>Oh yeah, convolution is just like cross correlation except in another case the function is reversed. So you can imagine the applications in data mining etc.<p>All in all Fourier Transform, and related ones, is an extremely huge and massively important concept, it&#x27;s hard to overstate it&#x27;s usefulness.<p>Personally I can say that I&#x27;ve used filter design tools to make a really smooth accelerometer data processing function.

Indeed, someone else might choose to just keep their billions in the family, for the sake of obnoxious levels of luxury. I'm sure there are some billionaires exactly like that.<p>Anyways, the whole problem with <i>trying</i> to become a billionaire is that it's really a lottery. Sure, someone determined could probably earn a few million through effort alone, but becoming a billionaire requires a special mix of smarts, hard work, and luck. Mostly luck, disproportionately so. You can't just will yourself to earn billions.",1319774257
3166934,comment,3166335,3166762,7,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"I think the fixation on money is mostly because it's quantifiable. Most people, at least at some point in their lives, feel the need to compare themselves to those around them.  There's 2 problems with value and meaning. First when you have a life that is fulfilled and meaningful you tend to be less interested in demonstrating that you are provably superior others or even ranking yourself, after all if you are fulfilled what gain is there? And more practically, it's a qualitative thing, there is no ordered relation on the set of value and meaning in ones life, so you can't really compare in an absolute manner.<p>Having gone through several large pay increases in my life, the really strange thing is that salary doesn't really affect that much.  It slightly reduces stress about 'having enough' though most middle class (upper and lower) people can always be wiped out by disasters, and it only slightly improves your day to day life.  When I was younger I'm sure I dreamed about making what I do today, but having gotten there I realize that if I were ever to arrive at my revised dream salary today it probably wouldn't change all that much.",1319774230

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb<p>I've tackled a few important milestones that take Better History miles above the other history options. Core features...<p><pre><code>  * Organizing history into digestible time intervals
  * Grouping visits from the same domain
  * Enhancing day filters
  * Using Preferences UI
  * Deleting beyond removing single visits
  * Evolving the time interval interface
  * Making search actually work
</code></pre>
I think the last point is the most important. Searching your history in Chrome is completely broken if you ask me. I put lots of energy into fixing that and you can read about it here:
http://automagical.posterous.com/making-chromes-history-searching-better<p>Fun Facts. It took about 85 days to hit 500 users. It took 1 day to up that number to 1,840 users. The next day it doubled to 3,763 users. Pretty exciting!<p>The jump in users was due to the Chrome Store redesign and the promotions that I prepared. Check them out here:

These would become supervoters, and their votes would confer or remove some multiple of karma for each up- or down-vote.  In so doing, they would exert a proportionally larger influence on the visibility of comments, hopefully helping to highlight good ones and bury bad ones.<p>The supervoter bit would not be static; it could be gained or lost.  A supervoter whose submitted comments received net negative votes by other supervoters would lose their bit, as would one who consistently voted against the trend established by the other supervoters.  Similarly, a non-supervoter who tended to submit and upvote comments that were favoured by existing supervoters and downvote comments that were buried by supervoters (before they had been greyed out, to avoid gaming) could, after a certain threshold, have their bits flipped as well.<p>Ideally, this process would be entirely transparent, with no one but yourself and other similarly privileged users able to see who had the bit.  Similarly, it would be best if the change went unannounced.  I'm aware that HN is OSS; perhaps it would be better to leave this out of that repo as reddit does with anti-spam measures.  The reason for the secrecy is the same as that for hiding karma scores: it reduces karmawhoring and gaming.<p>As for submissions, I think the problem there is both less severe and easier to solve.  HN's front page is still slow enough that it can be hand-curated.  More mods would likely be able to keep a handle on things.  However, an algorithmic solution could work.  Similar to supervoters, have superflaggers: if the ratio of submissions someone flags to those removed is high enough, flip a superflagger bit in their profile.  Then, any article in the new queue that was flagged by (say) 3 or more superflaggers would be automatically removed.<p>The reason I like these proposals, as well as the submission's, is that they are invisible and nobody knows if they are even operational.  By hiding these workings from membership at large, I believe it would be possible to have a positive effect on quality while still discouraging the kinds of behaviours that have led to a massive decrease in quality on large parts of reddit.",1319771947

Sometimes people upvote without reading the article just because the comments are good, and want others to benefit from that as well.<p>2.  Sometimes people upvote to save a submission, since there's no separate save function.  For example, I want to send it to a friend later, but not right now, so I upvote it to make it easier to find (b/c HN search is hit-or-miss).<p>I confess I'm guilty of these, but I doubt I'm the only one.<p>By way of comparison, take Reddit.  Upvoting and saving are separate functions.  You can save submissions you think you might want to revisit later.  Reasons for doing so:<p>1.  Scanning the headlines quickly, but don't have time to actually read everything, want to save the article and comments for later perusal (lunch break, after work, whatever).<p>2.  Subreddits reduce the cost of upvoting.  For example, every time I consider whether to upvote a Bitcoin story on HN, I consider whether it's front-page worthy.  On Reddit, that's not a problem, I can just assume it won't hit the general front page b/c it's a relatively niche subject, but the upvote might help it within its own subreddit.<p>One more potential problem with the idea of superflaggers.  If 'social media experts', or spammers, or whatever the people are who game sites like Digg and Reddit got wind of the fact that flagging honeypots could increase the weight of their flags and/or votes, mightn't they also figure out how to abuse that?<p>A professional, as some of them seem to be (eg, able to spend all day every day doing this), might be able to achieve a denominator very close to 1, and a numerator close to the total actual honeypots.",1319771563

It isn't solely because you can't hide it or remove it, it's because in addition to that it is generally really poorly written software that has a terrible user experience and often only exists as an advertisement to some other product or service (ie. NASCAR app). Additionally in the case of some manufacturers and carriers, the standard UI is replaced with potentially less usable, but more importantly <i>non-standard</i>, creating an inconsistant user experience which fragments the platform.<p>TL;DR: if you buy an iOS device you get a <i>consistant user experience</i>.

If you're wanting to go off the beaten path, fix your own issues.  There are internal wiki's where the mac enthusiasts pour time into other people's issues, and a general word-of-mouth troubleshooting culture.<p>From the context of the conversations I've heard, I think the major hurdles are around security, support, and hardware costs.  Before I'm jumped for implying less security with macs, it's still centered around the ability for the enterprise to control virus scanners, DLP, workgroup rights, generic company control, etc.  Whether the operating system is more/less secure is still a religious argument - my guess is more IT staffs consider it less secure however.<p>Which leads to an interesting question - since the user experience has lead to a large enterprise install base, when does Apple start prioritizing business needs?  Admittedly I'm not an apple user, but I haven't seen any indication that's it's even on a list.  I imagine I'm incorrect.",1319770841

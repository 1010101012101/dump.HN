Additionally, teens ages 12-17 do not use Twitter in large numbers – just 8% of online teens 12-17 say they ever use Twitter, a percentage similar to the number who use virtual worlds. This puts Twitter far down the list of popular online activities for teens and stands in stark contrast to their record of being early adopters of nearly every online activity. </i>",1298260759

2244201,comment,2243297,2243297,0,0,pjscott,,,"For the people who've always wondered why it was called ""dynamic programming"", there's a funny story there. I'll quote Richard Bellman, who coined the term:<p>""I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. An interesting question is, 'Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from?' The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research. We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word, research. I'm not using the term lightly; I'm using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term, research, in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term, mathematical. The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various rea- sons. I decided therefore to use the word, 'programming.' I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying—I thought, let's kill two birds with one stone. Let's take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it's impossible to use the word, dynamic, in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.""<p>So there you go: it was supposed to sound cool, and dynamic, and like something that any self-respecting congressman would want to fund. I'd always vaguely suspected.",1298260684

2244184,comment,2243297,2243631,0,0,pjscott,,,"When I first read about dynamic programming, I was already familiar with the idea of memoizing a naive recursive program to make it efficient. After that, hearing all this talk about oddly-shaped tables was actually kind of irritating. ""Why are they going to all this trouble to talk about specific ways of memoizing recursive functions?"" I asked myself, rhetorically. ""Using a hash table has the same amortized asymptotic complexity, and this <i>shouldn't</i> be hard.""<p>It just seemed like way too much artificial complexity for what was, at heart, a remarkably simple and easy technique. This still bothers me.

Make it as frictionless as possible to upload videos and add a posting. Right now, Craigslist has all the users, so your value-add should be more specific. Nothing prevents me from linking to YouTube from my Craigslist postings, but almost nothing is as easy as tapping a couple buttons on my smartphone.<p>""The Local Marketplace to Buy, Sell, Exchange and Advertise Anything You Desire by Video"" is a little too wordy. Make a large bold heading that says something like ""Buy and Sell Anything With Video.""<p>Mention the web site at every opportunity. Even to friends. Friends are the best people to tell. Not because they'll give you honest feedback, but because you'll know you've got a good idea if they begin to talk to each other and their friends about it. Similarly, comment on every blog that has a related post. Google Blog Search works wonders for finding recent posts to comment on. I've found that when I mention my startup, a person sometimes just goes and writes a blog post that drives a couple hundred users my way. Include a link in every email you send. Include it in your forum signatures. Tell everyone you get the opportunity to tell. On your blog, talk about something loosely related to the product. Write very thoughtful posts, but write consistently. Once a week is good. Once every day is outstanding. Your posts should produce some value well beyond the scope of your product. Your posts should be helpful on their own.<p>EDIT: I noticed a comment below about design -- I agree with it. If you look at Craigslist, it's minimal, but it's consistent. I'm no designer, but I use one technique that has allowed me to ""fake it till I make it"" -- pick a single color that looks nice on a screen. Use 3 different shades of that color (a light, middle, and dark). Use black, white, and 2 shades of gray. Take these 6 colors, and limit yourself to them. The more consistent your colors, the more professional you look.<p>Don't do a contest unless it's completely necessary. It's only been a month, and not many people actually buy/sell stuff online. See if you can narrow your focus a little more. Craigslist started small, and you can too.<p>Try branding yourself as a sleeker, easier, more intuitive Craigslist. Right now, your idea is good, just focus on executing small but with high quality.",1298260095

2244164,comment,2243213,2244147,0,0,pjscott,,,"Shared libraries are just that: shared. They get memory-mapped, and the code is shared between processes. When a program has many threads open, something similar happens: the code is shared between the threads, but they get different stacks. Those stacks are a problem if you're spawning tens of thousands of threads, one for each connection you have open concurrently. You may find yourself running out of memory, or at least using way too much.<p>What Tornado does instead is serve a large number of connections from a single thread, using epoll to block on a group of threads until one or more are ready for I/O. This has much lower memory overhead, and does not require switching among threads.<p>This kind of I/O model is at its best when you have a huge number of connections, idle most of the time, and there are very few CPU-intensive operations.

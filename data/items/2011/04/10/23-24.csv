2430713,comment,2430519,2430613,4,0,jules,,,"Part of it is learned behavior, but part of it is not. Boys and girls are different even at a young age. They play in different ways: boys are more likely to build and break things, girls are more likely to make a story. Girls will try and make you like them by acting cute. My parents gave me and my brothers girls toys to try at a young age, which we threw around, and we used them to build piles and to rode on them sliding across the room.<p>At a later age, social pressures become very important. Boys are encouraged to do boys things and girls are encouraged to do girls things. People tell a boy to walk with his chest forward in a manly way. People tell a girl to be careful and not do dangerous things like climbing trees. The same goes for clothing and other preferences. When I was young and people asked me what my favorite color was I knew that green or blue was the right answer and pink or purple was not.<p>As for LGBT preferences I think the same applies. There are definitely gay boys who act a bit like girls even at a young age, and lesbian girls who act a bit like boys at a young age, but this is absolutely not a general rule. Societal pressures are another part of why gay men often act relatively more feminine and lesbian women often act more masculine: on LGBT people there is less pressure to act in a way that confirms their gender, and it's easier for them to ignore the pressure. Until recently if a guy wore pink clothing he would be ""corrected"" by his friends and family. This is less likely to happen if the guy is gay, and if it does happen the pressure is easier to ignore because he or she has already dealt with the far greater pressure to be with the opposite gender. Still there is a large group of men who wouldn't wear pink simply for fear of being perceived as gay. Since openly gay men are already perceived as gay this problem goes away. I conjecture that closeted gay men are <i>less</i> likely to wear pink for this reason.",1302478134

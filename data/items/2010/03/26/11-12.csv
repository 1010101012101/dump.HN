They only aim to reject apps that are against their rules or that are malware.<p>Recently one of my web sites was cloned badly for an iPhone app, and it was just bad. As in ugly - sure, it had the functionality, but nothing else. Certainly not Apple standards.<p>Also, the video game crash might have had all sorts of reasons, among them a lot of competition. You don't need an ""app store"" to establish a brand that is recognized for quality. Isn't the Nintendo Seal of Quality a good example? You can just invent such a seal and let the rest of the competition get by without the seal.<p>There are certainly a lot of crap games for the Wii around, is my impression.

Which might not sound so bad, except that corporations are so omnipresent that the media is dominated by them. (Like with this Washington Post article; both the advertisers and the media company are corpoate.) So by an analogy, I guess it feels kind of like working for a really big corporation, where everyone knows you're basically supposed to say what the bosses want, refined by specialized PR organs. (One where they don't merely control the government; they ARE the government.)<p>Maybe China's censors get to work in pleasant offices, and have incentives like climbing the job ladder, more luxuries and status, greater pay if they move to the private sector, etc. Some might be ideologues, others cynical; maybe most just treat it like a job and they're just cogs who kind of know better but are too comfortable where they are, like the people I know about working on facial recognition for CCTV systems.<p>But yeah, the Chinese system is a lot cruder.

5682292,comment,5681667,5681667,8,0,IsaacL,,,"I'm surprised with he haven't got the usual HN comments which appear every year when this story is posted. That's a good thing, but here's my ""inb4"" reply for when those comments finally pop up.<p>Type 1. Last year there was a comment like ""I dont want to crush dreams. But these kids are being set up to fail. They cannot, and will not, live up to these expectations."" Related to this are the complaints that these kids only achieved the things they've achieved prior to the programme because their parents were well-connected and helped them out, etc.<p>Type 2. Accusing hypocrisy on behalf of Thiel, who has two advanced degrees, and who often advocates for a return to advanced research which couldn't happen without higher education.<p>I think type 1 comments come from envy, even if they sound like something else. That's understandable, since many HN readers probably have similar smarts to these kids but didn't get the same opportunities in their teens. I know I felt jealous when I first heard of the Thiel program.<p>But - if you look at history, geniuses seem clustered around particular times and locations - ancient Athens, Renaissance Venice, Victorian London, and a few other cultural hubs. This implies that there were thousands of <i>potential</i> geniuses who died in rice paddies (or were killed in war, or who happened to be members of oppressed minorities, or who lived in an era when all the smartest people worked in investment banking, or whatever). It's not just that these individuals were robbed of their potential, it's also the world that was robbed of their contributions. So any attempt to mitigate that trend can only be a good thing, even if it means that some future Einsteins are still dying in rice paddies.<p>Part 2 is a more interesting critique. My response: I can't speak for Peter Thiel, but I don't think he believes that university shouldn't be an option. Rather, university shouldn't be the <i>only</i> option.",1368125958

5682271,comment,5680164,5682157,1,0,betterunix,,,"I think this paper presents a poor security definition for Bitcoin, at the very least because it assumes a non-adaptive adversary (i.e. the adversary cannot change which nodes it controls over time).  That is not how things work in the real world; in the real world, the adversary will keep increasing his computational power (the number of ""pawns"") until his attack is successful.  I am also skeptical of a computational model that assumes the adversary's computation is somehow synchronized with the honest parties'; that is not even remotely realistic, and it is very weak.<p>In other words, that paper does not tell us anything we did not already know:  Bitcoin is secure only if nobody does as much computational work as the rest of the network combined (though there may be other attacks on the protocol that have not yet been discovered).  If anything, this paper is a step towards formalizing a security definition for a protocol that is similar to Bitcoin, or a step towards proving that there will always be a polynomial time attack against such protocols (as was the case with Merkle's puzzles).",1368125598

[1]<p>I expect many people on this site are lucky enough that they can work on whatever they want - either because their interests happen to align with what's currently in demand by the market (as in my case) or because they were lucky enough to be born to rich parents or win the startup lottery.<p>But take a step back and look outside of that world. Consider, for example, the many people working as cashiers or cleaners. Do you really think that all or even most of them work those jobs because that's what they genuinely want to do, given a choice? It seems much more likely that the main reason why most of them work in those jobs is that they have to make ends meet somehow, and those are the kinds of jobs available to them.<p>As for the more on-topic part...<p><i>Why do you assume that those intelligent people would not engage in some other little value add activity that can make them a lot of money.</i><p>I don't. There may be other talent-wasting sectors in the economy (and I guess you always get <i>some</i> geniuses spending their time on whatever the equivalent of card counting of the day is). I have simply pointed out that HFT is one of them (and I do believe that finance in general is the worst offender at this time).<p>[1] If you intended to imply the quantifier ""some people"", I apologize for my misinterpretation - though in that case, I would wonder what the point of the statement was. Certainly it doesn't help paint capitalism in a positive light, because <i>every</i> economic system allows <i>some</i> people to work on whatever they want, while the rest tend to have the same superficial choice of job that they do in capitalism.

Software which implements a subtly different algorithm might be able to join the consensus until some case arises which triggers the difference, after that consensus between the implementations would be impossible.<p>Unfortunately, it's rather hard to demonstrate that two dissimilar complex programs actually implement exactly the same function.<p>This is doubly true because performance is very important, so some techniques that might help e.g. define a kind of abstract turing machine, write the rules for the distributed algorithm in its language, then different implementations use the same rules and only have to prove their turing machine implementation is functionally identical aren't readily available.<p>It can be hard to gain confidence through testing because some of the most important rules are for cases which are forbidden, so these cases will not show up on the production network they only happen when an attacker produces them. There are an infinite number (subject to memory, and already the function input is gigabytes of data) of valid and invalid cases, so exhaustive testing of the whole function is not possible.  They can also arise out of implicit behavior, ""what happens when this value overflows?"", ""what is the maximum size of this structure"", etc.<p>This is further complicated by the fact that Bitcoin implementations use third party code that wasn't written with this kind of must-have-exact-behavior in mind. The reference implementation uses things like OpenSSL's crypto and bignums, various boost data structures, BDB (previously, now leveldb)... and subtle potentially undocumented and unknown behavior from this third party code may be leaking into the definition of the consensus algorithm.  The reference implementation has been slowly disentangling these dependencies, but things like the hidden BDB locking limitations (which depend on the layout of the database on disk) are easy to miss.<p>(Third party code isn't just a reference implementation issue, e.g. BitcoinJ's full node code has had algorithm inconsistencies arising out of undocumented behavior in a database library it uses)<p>Satoshi's answer for this was that there should only be one implementation of the full node software.  However, ""create your own Bitcoin implementation"" seems to be the new millennium's ""create an IRC client"" so it seems that this is unrealistic... and there have been more than a half dozen attempts (including two nearly complete ones in java, two in C, three in C++, one in Haskell, one in erlang, one (two?) in javascript, as well as several non public ones (including one in ruby, I think)).",1368124851

If I make a misstep with regards to to CPU arch, feel free to correct (naturally).<p>""The instructions in the CPU are no different from the statements in the Principia""<p>As the goal of the PM was to show that math was a function of logic, we can use 'statements in the Principia' and 'the classical rules of logic' interchangeably in this context.<p>There's two questions at play in this conversation. One is whether <i>in principle</i> the question of the <i>meaning</i>, as such, of software, can be considered apart from the whole act of perceiving the software, either as code or as the final UX.<p>As the idea of ""meaning"" always involves some kind of communication, a sign or set of signs shared between two subjects, and as the idea of software pointing back to its own internal state as the content of this communication would render the communication pointless and the signs merely tautological, I think the question of <i>meaning</i> must bring the subject, and the act of perception and interpretation, into consideration. Scientific statements of fact, regarding the physical position of all of the machine's atoms and electrons, have content, but not ""meaning"" in the common sense of that term intended in the current context.<p>The second question, which I'm pretty much winging here (although I have long-held opinions about the PM and its relationship to the same kinds of considerations about ""meaning""), is whether CPU instruction sets, as subsets of the rules of logic, dictated by the fundamentals of CS (Babbage, Turing, et al), are ""pure"" expressions of logic, or whether in the act of abstracting logic into the restricted set of instructions, we've performed an analogy.<p>I think the same question comes to bear -- it matters which perspective you're taking, whether ""meaning"" is merely a construction that hides the more essential question of physicality, or whether ideas like ""push"" applied to things like registers and addresses and binary values are linguistic in nature and convey more than just tautological facts about the physical state of CPU internals.<p>I guess this pushes the question out -- why does a computer exist? To represent to the world the bare facts of its own internal state? Of course not. A 64-bit address that points to a sequence of binary values is never just that, it's always a sign that points to something else -- a <i>person's</i> address; a representation of an English character; a shipment of goods; a lat/long location of some specific place in the world.<p>So, a ""move"" or ""shift"", to you, may reduce backwards to a collection of logical operations. But even there, what has happened? Nothing's ""moved"" or ""pushed"", that's just an linguistic trick to help us think of the electrical currents being turned ""off"" and ""on"" (and even those are analogies) in mentally-manageable concepts that map to the rules of logic. To me the question of ""meaning"" has already been broached at this point, if we wish to see computations as significant beyond, again, tautological statements about CPU internals. If we take the latter point of view, we have mere mathematical statements that have the same point as pure math -- the elegance (if that) of its own proof, not any relationship to something external to itself. But of course, that was never the real point of computers from the very beginning.<p>The Godel/Russell/Whitehead question is apt here, because this is a very similar question, if not the same question. Is math a function of logic -- that is to say, can math be ""true""? The point of the Principia was to bring about the dream of the Vienna Circle, a purely mathematical and systematic technical language to resolve all philosophical ambiguity once and for all. While there remain a few holdouts for that dream, the general consensus is that this did not work out -- Godel was only one of many problems with Positivism specifically, and I would argue, Analytical Philosophy in general, although in recent years the Analytical/Continental divide has been shortened.<p>""What is logic made of?""<p>Yeah. This. That's the question driving all of this.<p>Good conversation.",1368124551

Fixing this would be <i>incredible</i>!<p>3. Minor visual issue, but it seems the first indentation of a comment is not indented, as the other levels are. The first indented level has a color, but is not actually indented. This would help to make comments slightly more readable. I do love how easy it is to fold comments though. A quick tap and instantly folded.<p>Anyway, I love the app; you did a great job on it. If it had these three features above, it would definitely be my go-to Android app for Hacker News.

The first person thinks of a random number, adds his salary to it and tells it to the person on his/her right (so noone else hears!). The next one adds his salary and tells it to the next person and so on. When it re-reaches the first person, he then subtracts the original random number. 
The result is the sum of their salaries, which can then be divided to yield an average.

It's the greedy search strategy that leads to linear time performance.<p>They're really only conceptually orthogonal, because in practice once you choose shift-reduce you're always going to choose greedy/deterministic/whatever search. I'm not aware of any shift-reduce/transition-based parsing results that don't use 1-best or beam search.<p>> I am not aware of state-of-the-art results from greedy shift-reduce parsers.

5682153,comment,5674193,5681734,1,0,kbenson,,,"> It's not that I forgot that part, it's that that's the hard part. That's the reason PGP is hard to use: They try to make sure you do it securely. And you can't have some third party do that part for you without trusting them, and the whole idea is not to have to trust any third parties. What public servers are you going to use here? Does each email user have to run their own server? Unless you have a single central server, how do you know which server corresponds to which user?<p>I'm certainly not going to argue with this, it's the basic gist of my original reply. :)<p>> Automating web of trust could be interesting though. Imagine you get an email from a new user that you've never received any email from before. There is some new P2P network where if you have someone's public key, you ask that user whether they know the new user's public key, and they send back a signed response (either ""this is the key I have"" or ""I don't have a key"", signed either way with the known user's public key). Then if all your friends who have the new user's key agree on what it is, it's probably right. If nobody has it, you get encouraged to verify it manually (i.e. in person). And if they don't all agree you get the nasty warnings about something fishy going on.<p>Exactly.  This is similar to what I was envisioning when I was talking about confidence levels.  Having different levels such as ""I have personally verified (signed)"" and ""I know of and reasonably trust this key based on people I trust"" and making that public in some manner would allow a slew of interesting techniques to verifying public keys to different assurance levels.<p>Come to think or it, it sounds like what we need is for a social network to adopt this.  Google+ with it's real name requirements might make a good fit, but maybe real name isn't what we care about, maybe we just care about email.  Alternatively, some alterations to diaspora might work out well (I know little about it other than it's a roll your own social network that I think can work as a node of a larger network).<p>> That seems like a low-effectiveness method of sending spam, given that the public key is uniquely identifying and tied to a sender address, so once the spam filter realizes everyone is marking all those messages as spam it can just blacklist everything sent using that key. Also, how is it different from existing PGP other than that more people would be using it? If you've infected a machine with a virus you can do whatever you want to it. You could just write the spam directly to the user's inbox, or send it out from their own address and sign it with their actual key. Compromised machine = you're screwed.<p>I'm imagining a virus that generates one on the infected system for the address the mail client is configured for.  That could be a LOT of new keys.<p>The problem is the thousands or millions of bogus keys that start being sent from addresses that previously didn't have ANY key associated with them (or did, but not through that machine), clog the web of trust if they make it on there.  If they are automatically added to mail client/PGP systems on the recipients end, that's a lot of bogus keys in users mail clients (even if it's just the 10% that arrive before spam filters react).  If clients end up syncing their known keys to some central repo at some point, that's a LOT of bad data.  I can imagine a case where someone generates a legitimate key and gets it personally signed by a few people, only to find that it's verified by hundreds of people on some public servers.<p>As for low-effectiveness, if it evades more filters by just a few percent, at the scales spam is sent that's a BIG deal.<p>> This isn't even necessary for a virus. The problem with viruses is that they can stay resident until you type your password and then it doesn't matter how hard the password was.<p>True.  I imagine the really fast spreading and pervasive virus's need to be quicker than that though, but I have nothing other than a hunch to base that on.",1368124364

Well, OK, I guess Cadillac is still the ""luxury"" brand.  What what does Chevy represent?  Performance cars (Corvette, Camaro), electric cars (Volt), entry level cars for first-time buyers (??? I don't even know what their model for that is these days), or something else?<p>This is probably going a bit off-topic, but when GM did the big brand re-org, I think they screwed the pooch.  If they were going to kill what was supposed to be their ""performance"" brand (Pontiac), they should have repositioned Chevy into that role, and focused on the Corvette, Camaro and similar models.  Saturn could have picked up all of the low-end, entry level stuff, and Buick would have made a fine home for generic mid-level sedans and family cars. Where electric cars fit into this is subject to debate, I suppose.  I would think you could position one as either ""luxury"" and put in under the Cadillac brand, or ""performance"" and put it under the Chevy brand (in my re-imagined GM).<p>Anyway... sorry for rambling. I grew up a fan of GM products, Chevy in particular, and still own a 1968 Camaro, so I have some sentimental attachment to them.

Most systems today (like Google) use statistical MT that learns patterns from millions of examples. In interlingua, by contrast, you analyze the input sentence to form a language-independent representation of the sentence's meaning. Then you use that representation to generate a sentence in a new language.<p>As you might expect, this is basically impossible for wide-domain MT because we don't have unambiguous representations of the meaning of every sentence, and we don't necessarily know how to combine them, and there's a lot of non-compositional phrases, and on and on.<p>However, if we restrict ourselves to one small domain, interlingua can work. For example, the KANT system [1] is an interlingua that is built for translating technical manuals for Caterpillar products (bulldozers and so on). The input has to be written in a restricted subset of English (Caterpillar Technical English), but then you can analyze it exactly with hand-written rules, and produce exact output in the target language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Research/Kant/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Research/Kant/</a>",1368123569

On principle, strong painkillers were not administered even in severe cases. According to Mother Teresa's philosophy, </i><i>it is 'the most beautiful gift for a person that he can participate in the sufferings of Christ'.""<p>The quality of care offered to terminally ill patients in the Homes for the Dying has been criticised in the medical press. The Lancet and the British Medical Journal reported the reuse of hypodermic needles, poor living conditions, including the use of cold baths for all patients, and an approach to illness and suffering that precluded the use of many elements of modern medical care, such as systematic diagnosis. Dr. Robin Fox, editor of The Lancet, described the medical care as ""haphazard"", as volunteers without medical knowledge had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors. He observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so that </i><i>people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment.</i> (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa</a>)<p>As a Canadian, I think I strongly prefer our government-provided healthcare to the Mother Theresa version.",1368123244

But it's not a big enough effect to say ""When I see someone on the street I can look at their height and know which of these two cities they're from.""<p>And my peeve is that people will see a statistically significant difference and think that that alone makes it an important finding, versus a very real finding that might not actually matter that much.<p>Or, related, it's bad to see something with a p-value of .15 and a large effect size and decide that since it's not significant at .05 it's not interesting. Since that combination typically means that you have a too-small sample size, the best interpretation is probably more like ""This might be interesting. Looks like we don't have enough data to tell if there's a relationship here, but it probably deserves another look.""<p>(Edited to add that last thought, and clarify the previous one)",1368122735

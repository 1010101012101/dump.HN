183010,comment,182369,182990,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"There are prohibitions against usury in the literature of most of the major religions. Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Obviously, the contemporary versions of these religions have loosened their positions. Protestants, for example, haven't been seriously opposed to usury for centuries. Islam, however,  is still opposed to it. The Muslim world has its own banking system. Would you have made the same comment if the OP hinted that he was Muslim?",1210121561

183002,comment,182755,182985,0,0,ardit33,,,"Honestly, it is not an indictment, just an observation.  I actually like having many friends, getting invited to many things, but I also don't like when many people RSVP to things, and they just don't show up.   I actually can directly quanitfy and compare this at soccer games.  In boston about  80% of yes-es would actually show up at games.  In SF about 60%.<p>I guess, you could also argue that in the east coast, people are less friendly, so you have fewer friends and people have to keep them closer and dearly, or that in SF there is a lot of stuff to do, and people can get easily ditracted.<p>BTW. I am european, so don't want to transform this in a west coast vs. east coast thing.<p>When it comes to twitter, I am not sure how much the general crowd would be interested in it.  Taking example something like blogs:  it has instant appeal in a lot of people, because basically it is an online diary.<p>A lot of people have diaries, and bringing them online was something natural.<p>But twitter?  I am not sure it solves a need to the general masses, except for the hyperconnected ones.",1210120616
183001,comment,182369,182718,0,0,ovi256,,,">Most Christians take offense when people insinuate that they still believe in Geocentrism or something like that and this is very similar.<p>I beg to digress, if you care to discuss it. It is not similar. Geocentrism is a theory of the world and was abandoned in the view of newly discovered undisputable facts. The prohibition on usury is a moral judgement, an axiom of a moral system, not a theory or view of the world, and as such cannot be changed by facts. I thought that difference was obvious. It is furthermore closely related to generosity and the sin of greed. Modern sects have abandoned this prohibition simply for convenience, thus completely changing their moral framework, and they have nothing to do with the original Christians.",1210120542

182997,comment,182369,182724,0,0,lee,,,"Interestingly, the issue was resolved in the 1490s for the Catholic Church with the discovery of the New World. The expeditions required financing and the financing entailed interest. The explorers were painting pictures of golden cities, boundless riches and fountains of youth, somehow the church managed to magically resolve the interest issue.",1210120287
182996,comment,182887,182909,0,0,alex_c,,,"I'm a bit surprised that neither this article nor the two currently on News.YC which reference it mention these reasons:<p>- revenue from in-app advertising has been steadily falling<p>- users have lost interest in apps and app invites, partly because the novelty has worn off, partly because they're sick of the spam.<p>Neither reason is surprising.  Most Facebook ad networks run ads for other apps... it was an obvious mini-bubble.  I believe CPMs were around $1 in November, and are now closer to $0.10.<p>As for invites, the effect of spammy apps on Facebook users is also not surprising.  Combine desensitized users with belated and arbitrary measures to combat app spam (which the article did mention), and the end result is that the first big apps are left with their millions of users and the ability to promote new apps to their existing users, while developers new to the game have a much smaller chance to get explosive growth.",1210120154

Levi Strauss profited handsomely from blue jeans becoming a fashion statement, even though they did not have a monopoly on wearing denim.<p>When you are the market leader, when you have the biggest piece of the pie, you have the most to gain from the entire pie growing exponentially. Right now, Apple has the most to gain from music players growing as a market. I suggest that DRM-free music makes the market for music players grow exponentially, and locked-in music holds the market back.<p>Remember, the vast majority of the music on iPods today is DRM-free MP3s. Apple profits from consumers ripping their CDs to MP3s. The more DRM-free music is out there, the more iPods people will buy, even though they also play on other machines.",1210118654

Believe it or not, this is actually a surprise to a lot of people, especially those trying to be in some way 'Web 2.0'.<p>Quick EDIT: I've actually seen people try to design fundamentally stateful APIs using REST. These people admit they are stateful, and that they must be stateful, yet they continue to use REST because it's what various web companies use and promote (for totally different problems).",1240853058

This is a side effect of very well-tuned retrieval algorithms that search for just the right words in your query, take into account user click-throughs for similar queries, and rank information based on billions of documents and eleven years of experience.<p>The Jeopardy problem is concerned natural language processing and knowledge representation as opposed to a tumult of data.

At best, it sounded like a prediction of a happy future.<p>What this article says is that we are now in that future.  Markets <i>are</i> conversations, and companies that aren't participating in the conversations are getting left out of the markets.<p>The Cluetrain Manifesto no longer reads like a series of utopian techno-determinist predictions.  It reads like a matter-of-fact description of how Amazon does business, how Fog Creek does business, how Zappos and Twitter and Flickr and Facebook do business, and why they are kicking the asses of their competitors.<p>There are some very big companies that it still doesn't describe, though.

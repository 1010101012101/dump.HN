He declared that the point was to enable this kind of filtering for people who aren&#x27;t technical enough to set it up for themselves, and that ultimately the decision and responsibility lies with parents.<p>In fact, it sounds a lot better than the system the current government (who is of course already criticising this policy) tried to ram down our throats recently.<p>(Disclosure: I just heard about this policy on the way home from voting early, and the intent of my vote was to benefit the current governing party more than the opposition proposing this system, after my preferred minor candidates are eliminated...I like Malcolm Turnbull a lot, but I don&#x27;t like his party&#x27;s policies any more than I suspect he does, at the moment.)",1378371550

6332934,comment,6329490,6331944,16,0,weland,,,"> My company has prototyped on both platforms, and I strongly prefer Android for this purpose. Test flight is significantly more inconvenient for all parties than sending around Android apks. So is Apple&#x27;s provisioning process for development (you&#x27;ll certainly have to figure out how to re-provision your development devices a few times).<p>Mine has also prototyped on both platforms and I will personally strangle anyone who suggests we do that on Android again. Slowly and painfully.<p>Sending applications for testing is somewhat more difficult on iOS, but that&#x27;s really the only gripe we had. Between the useless documentation and the horrible development environment, it consistently takes us about twice as long to get an initial demo up and running on Android. This is especially on UI-heavy applications, considering that Android still doesn&#x27;t have a decent UI builder.<p>(Just to put things into perspective: iOS&#x27;s has incremental/convenience features over the original NeXTStep GUI builder, which basically puts Android&#x27;s in a pre-1992 state).<p>The initial costs were higher for the Apple hardware, too, but even in the short term (1-3 months), it was worth it. This is <i>especially</i> true for a small company, that should prefer being punctual and keeping short deadlines.<p>> Finally, the Android developers that I know simply don&#x27;t use the simulator, they always use hardware.<p>I also used hardware when developing for Android. However, that was not because I&#x27;m an uberdeveloper who has some obscure skill, it&#x27;s simply because it sucks. It&#x27;s slow, the debugger borks every once in a while, the management interface is unusable and while the list of integration features is longer, when you start crossing out those that break every other build you&#x27;re pretty much left with just starting and stopping the simulator.",1378371329

Showing hand-drawn versions of your logo in what clearly is set in hardly-modified Optima (a typeface designed way back in the 1950s) makes me cringe. Why show fake process work?<p>2. No one is impressed when the manager does the job of their employees. For one, it implies that they don&#x27;t trust their employees, and secondly, it makes the job of designers look like a fun hobby that anyone can get into. The result is exactly what happened here: an utterly boring logo redesign that looks just-polished-enough to make people think that Marissa Mayer is some kind of genius, yet simple enough to make people think that true designers bring no value to the table.<p>3. The whole 30 days of logos schtick was awful. Good artists know that the worst thing you can do for yourself is show <i>too much</i> of your own work. After a while, everything looks same-y and the weaknesses begin to become more apparent. The whole concept reeks of indecision and a pray-to-God moment that one of the logos would have such a huge outpouring of support that the Yahoo! team wouldn&#x27;t have to make up their own minds on a vision.<p>4.

6332810,comment,6330921,6331466,1,0,nemothekid,,,"I think once facebook, and the more &quot;real identity&quot; networks came around, that &quot;natural&quot; communities got destroyed. I was thinking about some of the friends I had made when I was <i>13</i> that I still occasionally talk to, that I have never seen pictures of or even heard speak, that I had met online.<p>Back then groups were formed over interests, and the interests itself could be very niche, but the people you met were also interested in what you were interested in. It was like a self selecting group of uber-friends. The only step in relationship building was really &quot;oh you like thing? I like thing too.&quot; Relationships then were really about shared-interests.<p>However once facebook rolled around cyber communities became more like digital archive of real lives. You don&#x27;t friend someone on facebook because they had a similar interest with you (most of the time), you friend people that you had some in-life experience with. Now internet relationships are now really about shared-experiences.<p>Another way to look at it is if imagine you went to a bar by yourself, and everyone else in the bar came alone. You might imagine eventually people would group themselves by similar interests (although certain human dynamics might lead people to group with other people visually similar to themselves.)<p>In the post-facebook era its the same setup, but this time everyone bring 8-12 of their high school friends. Your high school friends may have not been had as much deep rooted interest in AstroMUD, but they are generally all-around ok people. At the end of the day you are really only together because you went to the same high school, and weren&#x27;t assholes to one another.",1378368588

The transition was swift because of iOS&#x27;s screen sizes/resolutions were well defined and straight forward, no fragmentation manager was required to handle different screens.<p>Although i was using a single device for Android, i couldn&#x27;t help but write a generic manager to handle different screens rather than hardcode my prototype to a single device. On the other hand, iOS screen and camera previews are hardcoded by design, and that saved me a lot of time.<p>Android being open source helped quite a bit, since i could borrow all that code from the stock camera app, but it was tedious to say the least. When i transitioned to iOS i was surprised how fast i got my basic camera app to work (few hours perhaps).<p>There are other reasons why i find iOS to be superior for prototyping (i have only touched on the camera preview issue).  One other example is the relative documentation. iOS documentation gets you going much faster when working with the camera at least.<p>Just my 2 cents.",1378368554

But I think care should be taken in the interview process to have topics diversity, which is another thing that bothers me with Google&#x27;s interview.<p>I participated in Google&#x27;s interview once. After 2 phone screenings with algorithmic questions I was invited to a full day on-site interview involving meetings with 5 people, all of which asked me to solve algorithmic problems. In the end I was told that I did OK at the first 3 meetings, but not so well on my last 2 (actually I was able to answer all the problems given to me, but my performance dropped at some point due to getting tired and the last 2 people probably had other questions they wanted to ask, but couldn&#x27;t due to lack of time).<p>Personally I recognize the importance of algorithms, data-structures and reasoning about asymptotic complexity. It&#x27;s stuff that some are learning since high-school and should be common knowledge for all of us.<p>But what about other things of importance, like actually being able to build and deliver functional software? What about things like the quality of the code you write, or being experienced in building scalable systems, or being capable of working in a team, or having personal projects? I was never asked (maybe it was just my chance to end up being interviewed only by people that cared about algorithms).<p>Of course, it can be said that these practices worked well until now for Google. After all, there are plenty of really capable people working there. But maybe that happened in spite of the interview process, not because of it (e.g. one reason could simply be that resumes with internal recommendations have priority and people at Google are good at networking and recommending other good people).",1378368395

This would be equivalent to just <i>creating</i> the photon map. Then you could just view the photon map directly, to see the intensity of the death ray.

17617,comment,13068,13068,0,0,juwo,,,"Would you have passed him by? and could you recognize any of the pieces?<p>I remember when my wife and I visited Paris on a package deal vacation a few years ago, we were enthralled by the musicians in the subway. They were ordinary musicians, but we loved their music. We did not tip more than a euro or two.
But listened and chatted with them, took their photos, and could not understand why everybody simply ignored them as pests.<p>One time it was a poor man playing the trombone skillfully, another time it was a woman violinist (a student), another time a poor man on an accordion.<p>About as many people passed by and everyone behaved, in fact, worse than the article. No one stopped to listen, nobody even tipped one euro.<p>So you see, it was not simply ignorant, right-wing Washington DC, but in one of the fasionable, snooty art capitals of the world that this happened.

When I first read them, I thought they were very annoying, because it's not one monolithic program, and there are a lot of one-line shell scripts that do sequential operations using exec.
The way he describes it, he's getting rid of a lot of parsing by using the directory tree instead of text files following.  But this use of directories can also be good for some of the more degenerate uses of databases.
Mostly I recall the ""aha"" moment of ""So, this is the Unix philosophy in action.""  The design is very elegant.<p>",1177728504

17614,comment,6668,6668,0,0,BusinessGolf,,,"Most failures and successes are based on the business' operations....too much marketing/sales will drive a start-up to failure.  Too much work setting up operations causes the business to really never start.  My advice to my clients is if you are not a person who can balance both sides of business you need to get another person to take on the part you are not strong at...most of the time it is Operations....<p>Scot Duke

17612,comment,17568,17568,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Really great response. <p>I had often lumped SmugMug and 37Signals into the same category, but I have to say that after the past few months I've come to see them in a different light. <p>37Signals while brilliant in much of what they do, has seemed to acquire the curse of hubris and it's embarrassing to see. Some of their recent responses to criticism in particular seem quite petty, abrasive, and defensive.<p>SmugMug on the other hand seems much more mature and even self-deprecating in their approach. After meeting Don McAskill it's easy to see why - he is one of the smartest and nicest guys I've ever met. He hosted a geek lunch recently and I was really impressed with him and how genuine he is.<p>Anyway, it's really great that there are some good examples to follow in our little startup world.",1177727950

The articles and stuffs in here are so good that its better to read it in than to visit multiple sites :)",1177725646

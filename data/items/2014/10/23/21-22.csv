8500994,comment,8500436,8500945,0,0,azakai,,,"Yes, I think those benchmarks are based on the Mono they use, which is indeed old. I would be very curious to see benchmarks compared to trunk Mono - should be interesting.<p>My information may be out of date, but typically people tell me that Mono tends to not match Microsoft&#x27;s .NET implementation in speed, and in turn, .NET tends to not match native C++ either. So I would still guess il2cpp can win here. Or are there benchmarks showing Mono matches .NET and/or native C++?",1414101562

Yesterday I checked that the suggested route was correct but Maps decided to reroute to the &quot;shortcut&quot; when I was nearing the destination. Depending on how you enter the destination (direct address vs search bar result) it&#x27;s iffy.<p>The address is a 6 month old hospital and ER. The first time I routed there to go to the ER my eyes almost popped out of my head at the suggestion of a 2-3 mile detour by getting back on the freeway. Later on I looked at Yelp and saw a reviewer talking about how they took that detour by accident on their way to the ER too.

There have been a lot of false starts in the past 20 years where we were hopeful western ideas would take hold in places where they haven&#x27;t:<p>- Fall of the USSR, and what appears to be its rise again<p>- Arab spring turning into unstable nation states, instead of nice representative democracies<p>- Iraq<p>- Afghanistan (time will tell)<p>Then again, this article ignores the swelling middle class in a lot of southeast Asia. And also, conflict exists everywhere and is often a defining characteristic for nations. For example, the author didn&#x27;t seem to have a true grasp of American history. The most important war we&#x27;ve ever fought was with ourselves, turning us from a loose collection of states into a single nation-state.

8500963,comment,8500217,8500653,0,0,lmkg,,,"Borges was well-read and read English and international works extensively (in fact, English was his first language, not Spanish), so it&#x27;s not completely unreasonable that he kept abreast of new developments. It&#x27;s still a stretch that he would know about some random court case in New York.<p>It&#x27;s odd to me that you characterize Boole as a philosopher--I&#x27;ve always heard of him as a mathematician. His work on an algebraic formalization of logic is foundational to the modern field of logic, which was the primary area of mathematic research (along with set theory) for the first three or so decades of the 1900&#x27;s. For example, the first chunk of Russel&#x27;s <i>Principia Mathematica</i> defines a new logical algebra to be used going forward.<p>It seems you think that the use of boolean algebra was popularized because of Shanon&#x27;s application of it to circuitry? Symbolic systems were well-used and well-known before that. For example, Goedel&#x27;s theorems (1929, 1931) deal explicitly with the symbolic representation of logical statements. And I daresay that the Incompleteness Theorem is something that Borges would have been intensely interested in, since it deals with the finite accessibility of knowledge.<p>In short, Borges would have chosen Boole because, at that time, it would have been perfectly acceptable to see his work on logic as being similarly foundational to the field of mathematics as that of Descartes (geometry) and Leibniz (calculus).",1414101148

The first and most prominent user of CRC-32C was iSCSI.<p>Its mathematical definition (at least one of the most &quot;official&quot; definitions) is found in <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3720#section-12.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3720#section-12.1</a> as a generator given in hex. The RFC gives 2 other references: an analysis where it was first published and discussed (<a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx1/26/5993/00231911.pdf?tp=&arnumber=231911&isnumber=5993"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx1/26/5993/00231911.pdf?tp=&ar...</a>) and another RFC (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3385</a>) that contains test vectors and implementations. However they are hardware implementations, not software. The number of documents you have to reference for a complete spec (definition + code + test vectors) is annoying... I share the author&#x27;s frustration in regard to this.<p>If you need more than 32 bits for an integrity check, a CRC is probably not what you need (want to prevent intentional malicious data tampering? use a crypto hash function).",1414100564

What are these &quot;strange feelings&quot;, so off to the doctor they go where they can be diagnosed with depression and get put on some Paxil/Prozac/Zoloft so they can be content going back to that same hum drum existence they were starting to question.<p>Not to derail the conversation too much, but fuck you.  That&#x27;s not even close to what depression is or how it works.  Depression isn&#x27;t when your life sucks so you feel bad, it&#x27;s when you feel bad for no reason, even when your life is objectively pretty good.  It&#x27;s a well documented medical phenomenon that can fortunately be managed rather well with, among other things, medication.  Comments like this, though, serve only to stigmatize treatment and actively discourage people from seeking help.<p>I have a close family member with depression.  They&#x27;ve been on Zoloft for a little over a year now and it has been a huge blessing.  The single biggest obstacle to getting them help was helping them overcome the social anxiety and sense of failure caused by stigmatizing and belittling attitudes like yours.<p>Yes, many more people are on antidepressants than in generations past.  Many more people also take antihistamines daily and get an annual flu shot and nobody thinks that signals some downfall of civilization.  Modern medicine has provided effective treatments for countless conditions, ranging from minor annoyances to debilitating illnesses, that previous generations had no alternative but to endure quietly.  In almost every area, save this one, this is rightly regarded as a triumph of science and a huge net good for humanity.  Why is it about mental illness that causes otherwise smart, empathetic, and scientifically literate people to start clutching their pearls?",1414100519

I experienced the support environment for the homeless population in Orlando before the laws, and I experienced the same environment after. There is a difference, and it is beneficial. I saw it, I heard about it, I experienced it, and I witnessed others follow the same path. So I know exactly what I&#x27;m advocating. But don&#x27;t take my word for it, read the article and listen to people who live this every day and are also advocates.<p>Second, you&#x27;ve developed one heck of a straw man. I don&#x27;t know where people think this law says you &quot;can&#x27;t feed/help the homeless&quot;. It never says that. It makes it illegal to reward destructive behavior patterns. If you want to help or feed the homeless you may do so! Just donate a couple dollars to your local shelter, or spend a night doling out mac n&#x27; cheese. Of course, now you can no longer do these things on your own terms, but then again this isn&#x27;t about you (as in the royal &quot;you&quot;). This is about helping the people that get no help otherwise.<p>We&#x27;re trying to encourage the use of the existing community solutions here, not ban them. This &quot;ad-hoc&quot; method of random gift giving that you seem to approve of is <i>actively harmful to both the community and those it aims to help</i>.<p>And actually (insert meme here), this removes state action from the equation, believe it or not. Police everywhere spend ridiculous amounts of time dealing with unscrupulous panhandlers, jerks who want to mess with the homeless, etc. etc. Now this law is probably just as unenforceable as &quot;don&#x27;t feed homeless people poison on purpose&quot;, but hopefully it creates a culture shift where people are pre-disposed towards more beneficial methods of activism, and the police don&#x27;t have to worry about ne&#x27;er do wells messing with defenseless people, or people taking advantage of other&#x27;s generosity. Nobody is throwing money at the state, nobody is getting a &quot;fix&quot;. In fact, this places more burden upon people to take it upon themselves to support their local organizations, and places a heavier burden on those organizations (because now they have more people to feed! which is an excellent problem to have, because now we have people seeking real help, instead of just trying to make it through the day!).<p>I appreciate your gracious hints, but I highly recommend you see the problem for yourself instead of relying on knee jerk reactions and the top google result.",1414100230

For the moment I have decided that I would prefer to stay contracting in the enterprise on extremely fixed working hours rather than try the start up route. It is a personal decision and each of us needs to make our own choices. My choices are about having a lifestyle that is comfortable and secure but where my career is mediocre. I know that and I accept it.",1414099693

Unless you&#x27;re actually in this situation, the decision will be heavily distorted. It&#x27;s one thing to say what you do in a difficult situation, it&#x27;s another thing to be in one and take the decision then and there.",1414098138

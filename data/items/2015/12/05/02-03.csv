On the face of it, it seems strange to invent a new way of representing vector graphics in markup when a standard already exists. However, the principal advantage of these shape classes is that they have been designed to integrate into the Avalon programming model. The vector drawing elements derive from the same FrameworkElement base class as all other XAML elements, and follow the same naming conventions. SVG has its own set of conventions for element and attribute names that is at odds with the existing .NET Framework class library. Furthermore, SVG elements were not designed to fit into the Avalon object model. By not using SVG, Avalon ensures that vector graphics can be mixed in with any other kind of markup in your XAML, and can take advantage of all of the same layout facilities. (Note that in the version of the Longhorn SDK documentation released at the 2003 PDC, the XAML elements used for vector drawing are sometimes referred to collectively as WVG (Windows Vector Graphics). However, Microsoft is no longer using this name, because it implies, incorrectly, that these elements are somehow distinct from all of the other elements supported by Avalon.)\n</code></pre>\nWhich is a lot more than just &quot;SVG has its own set of conventions for element and attribute names that is at odds with the existing .NET Framework class library.&quot;.",1449284210

A good example is the &#x27;Move&#x27; tool vs the &#x27;Grab&#x27; tool. I watched a guy nearly swear off KiCad because he only used Move and never Grab, so he was moving wire segments individually. If he&#x27;d read the documentation or searched for the answer, it would have been there. These tools are not particularly intuitive.<p>The best part of taking some dedicated time is that now I have 2-layer and 4-layer templates with my design rules, custom project settings, and a bunch of custom hotkeys.

You definitely have to get into its way of thinking, but once you do KiCAD works very well (as long as you only need design-rule checking and not more complex simulation). Using keyboard shortcuts allows you to work quickly once you learn what they are. I haven&#x27;t tried the new version, but from the previous stable release the feedback I have is that it needs better component and footprint management. As an open source project it should be easy for users to not only use components (this needs work), but also to contribute new ones. If you make a component locally there should be an automatic offer to upload it to an online component repository. The other thing is that I wish I could edit component fields in something approximating a spreadsheet view. I always maintain a separate BOM spreadsheet to track things beyond reference number. I&#x27;d like to list component IDs directly in KiCAD, but some (especially passive components) have very long names that clutter the schematic and silkscreen. I&#x27;d like the ability for component names to have &quot;display&quot; and &quot;full&quot; views, with the schematic showing the former and a generated BOM showing the latter. Ideally more fields would be built in too, so it wouldn&#x27;t be necessary to add keys for extra fields. Something like: description, chemistry / type, package, mfg, part number mfg, part number mouser, value, tolerance, qty, reference, unit ($), ext ($), 1k pricing ($), ext 1k ($), datasheet, note<p>This flowchart captures the KiCAD experience pretty well (though the &quot;PCB Done&quot; step is decidedly more time consuming than its symbol suggests):<a href=""http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/en/getting_started_in_kicad.html#kicad-work-flow-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/en/getting_started_in_kicad.html#k...</a>",1449281907

That&#x27;s very real leadership. I doubt that will stop until everything everywhere ( except for small reservations of respite from this phenomenon ) is an API.

Even when the latency is brought down, there&#x27;s still other audio related issues/glitches (like buffer underruns).<p>Even now that Android is measurably better than it was previously, things like buffer underruns can still affect the overall usability. Increasing the buffer (to fix the underruns) render the device less suitable for such things as using it with external MIDI controller. You can see from Superpowered&#x27;s audio latency measurements:<p><a href=""http://superpowered.com/latency#cta"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superpowered.com/latency#cta</a><p>that the buffer for iOS is half that of the best Android (the dual-core Nexus 9)- 64 instead of 128 for Android.<p>I",1449280858

However, implying that it can replace a designer/developer to represent the business in a professional manner, and it can be done for little to no cost, is way off the mark.<p>The article fails early when he compares a website to a word document or e-mail (more appropriate comparisons would be trade show booths, marketing brochures, and store layout/design), and all arguments he makes against a static site can also be made against the use of the weblog he promotes.",1243515486

What, exactly, is the price of a drowning polar bear, and how much of it is subsumed into the present discounted value of a flooded coastal city?<p>The reason I singled out capital gains is that it can often lead to a genuine positive externality: capital accumulated in the hands of those best able to discriminatively lend it out (i.e. not bankers).  I liked Rodgers' suggestion of taxing short-term capital gains (taxing negative effects of short-term speculation) but not long-term ones.

This is less than the value of circulating money in the U.S. alone, where more than $8.3 trillion is in circulation or in deposit (M2).[13] Therefore, a return to the gold standard, if also combined with a mandated end to fractional reserve banking, would result in a significant increase in the current value of gold, which may limit its use in current applications.",1243512510

Even if it were, it's still not valid -- I can't paint my car to look like a police car, can't alter my gun to look like a toy (concealed weapons laws prohibit it), and the printing press analogy is closer than you admit.<p>But the whole ""legally purchased"" line is <i>entirely</i> the wrong way to go about this. For example, in the case of Apple, the licence <i>specifically</i> prohibits purchasers from installing on a non-Apple machine. Breaking that means using the software in a way that it <i>isn't</i> purchased for, and the whole argument collapses.<p>The problem with the DCMA and laws like it aren't that they ""limit us doing things with stuff we've legally purchased"" -- the transfer of cash does not imbue us with special protections. The problems with those laws are that they infringe upon our other rights, such as fair use.<p>This distinction matters a lot, because by allowing this to be set in terms of purchases and contracts, we're getting caught up in licences and property law, when the argument should be much larger. Time-shifting recording is legal for TV and Radio -- why isn't it also for Spotify or last.fm radio? There are no purchases there, so the earlier arguments are irrelevant, but the same ultimate principle is at stake.<p>OS X is Apple's property: there's no outcome of playing with property law that lets you install it on any machine you want, DCMA or no. But cast in other terms that aren't nearly as well explored yet, it might be possible. What does ""fair use"" <i>mean</i> in the context of software?<p>IP laws depend on our behaving as if these were physical properties we were talking about. They aren't, it's an analogy that only loosely fits, and by accepting their definitions and playing on their turf we are handicapping ourselves.",1243512175

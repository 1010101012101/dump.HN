That&#x27;s basically the heart of all technology advancements.<p>However, the end result may or may not be better/higher quality. Transportation is moving from mostly hydraulic/mechanical to electrical/computer controlled, Comms (analog to digital), Food (local whole foods to distant mega farms and processing), etc.<p>Old technology is far less efficient, but can be much more robust. For example, knowledge recorded in a book cannot become corrupt due to a failing hard disk controller, or lost due to electrical surge from a near by lightning strike. And, one can still send a message over radio waves using Morse Code to distant places even when cell phones fail due to network outages or cyber attacks.<p>So while we are smaller, faster, cheaper and much more accessible today (in almost every way... thanks to technology), our systems are much more fragile and dependent on other components. In many cases, this is why older technology is used.",1452085171

Still, they might have their identity stolen, get scammed (e.g. Dell) or pranked (e.g. swatting, disconnecting utilities) or have their house broken into if they have bad luck. They might pay a premium on insurance for having the wrong friends on FB or get fired for holding certain opinions. Might get mobbed by the internet, get harassed by salesmen or silly ads for herpes.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that the above events are unlikely though. When a few actors have access to the information of tens of thousands to billions of people though, this has an impact on a societal level. As jaquesm said, information is power and when one has so much information and lots of money to boot, they can begin to covertly influence policy and behavior and harass and marginalize their opponents. And they can do that directly, or by using the information of a third party, like a doctor, lawyer, religious leader, or even someone insignificant which happens to be a relative, etc.\nMoreover, companies can be sold, together with their databases, they can be forced to hand them over or they can be hacked. A treasure trove of data held by an otherwise principled company, might end up in the hands of an unsavory party.<p>Why is this a bad thing? History has shown again and again how such imbalances of power are abused.

By installing software (an additional expense) your computer can help you organize music; write letters and organize photos.<p>With an internet connection (also an additional expense) your computer can gain access to a vast network of information and entertainment. You can watch movies and tv shows; read books online; learn how to cook and read the news on a variety of topics. If your up for a challenge, you can build your own places of interest, known as websites and sometimes earn money doing so.<p>Computers come in a range of sizes and budgets - from desktop computers that stay in your office, to portable ones you can put into a small bag. Some very capable computers can also fit in your pocket, though - we call these smart phones, not computer. Our prices range from $100 for something very basic to thousands that&#x27;ll allow you to edit your next movie.\n</pitch><p>Which sort of begs the question - in this day; what is a computer without an internet connection?

Can self serving advocacy by those who financially benefit from surveillance be termed a &#x27;debate&#x27;, as they are the only ones who make that point. I don&#x27;t know of anyone clamoring for surveillance as &#x27;its a good thing&#x27;. Is it a social good?<p>The ability of power or authority to lock you up, take your property or worse your life is protected by rule of law and due process. Having a debate of the rule of law or due process is similar to having a debate on privacy or a surveillance state. The consequences are negative for the individual and society as a whole, even though they may benefit some stakeholders in the short term who will of course advocate for it but on the whole it&#x27;s not a social good.<p>The only thing we have to come to this conclusion is history, a wide body of knowledge and reason.<p>We can thus say with some degree of confidence that a society without rule of law or due process is not a good thing similar to a society with surveillance is not a good thing. We don’t use the ‘moral high ground’ but reason and historical experience to make these conclusions. This is not a moral issue but a practical one that has consequences for our societies. The ethical issue is the social good for the people who build these systems.<p>Since we are discussing the social good the alternative view needs to be backed by reason on how surveillance can be good for society as a whole, beyond offering naive presumptions suggesting people are good and will not abuse the power, or how knowing details of everyone’s activities may be beneficial to an individual or company because while that may be true they do not address the social good.<p>And the only thing we use in these discussions is reason, let&#x27;s not make it personal.",1452084920

No one is talking about the US government making mistakes, and decades of intentional programs operated with similar strategies is hardly &quot;making mistakes&quot;.<p>Your entire analogy was insincere and meant to elicit an emotional response.<p>> If they get out of hand then we, the people, will deal with it.<p>Will we?<p>I&#x27;m actually very skeptical that we&#x27;ll deal with it in any meaningful way, and find it much more likely that we&#x27;ll surrender a great deal of control over the country to an autocratic government with a good social control program, precisely because people like you don&#x27;t want to sincerely discuss the likelihood of that happening by stages.",1452084906

I don&#x27;t want to appeal merely to authority, but, well, at some point I become frustrated at the level of superstition that backs these kinds of claims.<p>Look, I own multiple all-tube amps for my guitars. I understand the appeal (though it&#x27;s much more complicated than &quot;tube is better&quot;). I even understand the science for why tubes sound &quot;good&quot; and why solid state amps sound &quot;less good&quot;. (To be clear: It is not merely the presence of tubes.)<p>There are so many confounding variables, however, that people end up believing that a shitty so-called &quot;tube&quot; preamp that costs $20 to manufacturer and runs on a 5V power supply is somehow superior to a high quality solid state preamp <i>just</i> because it has a tube. The most sought after old Neve consoles and channel strips that people love so much? Solid state; not a tube in sight. They&#x27;re loved because they were extremely high quality, and have a subtle distinctive sound that is what our favorite records sound like (at least, our favorite records from a certain era of well-funded studio dilettantes).<p>And, while we&#x27;re at it, the best way to capture that particular color is digital. The difference between <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> and a digital recording today that doesn&#x27;t sound as amazing as <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> has less than nothing to do with DSOTM being recorded analog vs. digital and everything to do with the kind of budget, time, and skill Pink Floyd had in the studio.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing there isn&#x27;t a difference in quality to be discerned between different pieces of equipment. There absolutely is. But, Super 8 is not and never was, a high quality way to get images onto a screen. It was a compromise based almost entirely on cost. It just so happened that for many years it was a compromise that was necessary for filmmakers on a tight budget...video took a long while to catch up, and it probably took the switch to extremely high definition digital video to really put the nail into film&#x27;s coffin.",1452084405

An example from the past is only useful if it can be tangibly connected to the current situation, right now in the present.<p>I can&#x27;t think of a case where stable and mature democratic bureaucracy has ever used surveillance to influence the majority of its populace.

It&#x27;s true that any government could turn bad, in the same way that anything is possible. But there&#x27;s very little evidence for that in the current context.<p>So my position is this: Given that I live in the United States in 2016, I&#x27;m not worried about the government randomly deciding to screw with me by looking at my electronic communications and acting on them.

Why am I being treated differently, even though I&#x27;m doing and saying the same things as another Japanese person.<p>The second phase that quickly follows is anger. This is bullshit! I know my accent and pronunciation is correct! Why are they saying they don&#x27;t understand me! WTF!<p>The third is dull acceptance. You&#x27;re not going to change Japan. They&#x27;re not like this because they&#x27;re bad people. They&#x27;re just inexperienced with foreigners and foreign things, and they&#x27;re overcompensating and trying to be nice in the way they think is nice.<p>The final stage is fun. This is the best stage. You understand all the social patterns and why everything is happening, so you just relax and start enjoying it.<p>When you go into a restaurant and order in Japanese and the waiters response is &quot;I can&#x27;t speak English! Sorry!&quot; you respond in Japanese &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m terribly sorry. Is there anyone here who speaks Japanese?&quot;<p>This often (not always) has the interesting effect of changing the &quot;foreigners cannot speak or understand Japanese&quot; mindset, if only for a moment.<p>Sounds like you&#x27;re in between stages two and three. It gets better.<p>To quickly respond to your list:<p>1) It&#x27;s your face. It&#x27;s nothing personal.

So complimenting me on my chopstick skills feels the same as me complimenting you on your deft fork techniques.&quot; This may result in enlightening your Japanese friends as to why it&#x27;s challenging to be overly grateful for their well-intended compliment.<p>3) Kanji is hard. They&#x27;re just impressed that you can read it, since they spent years as kids studying and repeating kanji over and over again. Having said that, my typical response here is &quot;Actually, I think English is much, much harder than Japanese. Sure Japanese is difficult, but it&#x27;s logical. English is full of exceptions, weird spellings, inconsistent grammar, because it&#x27;s a mix of languages. If I wasn&#x27;t born a native speaker, I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;d learn English from scratch.&quot;<p>4) Yep - you&#x27;re definitely not alone.

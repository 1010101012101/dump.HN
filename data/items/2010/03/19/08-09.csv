1203680,comment,1201218,1203478,0,0,chousuke,,,"I think you'll find that whatever git does, it's faster than the corresponding operation in SVN.<p>When you send commits to a remote server, git compresses them and sends the packfile over the network. The server will refuse non-fast forward merges (the branch you're pushing is supposed to be merged by you first, locally) so it pretty much has nothing to do but uncompress the changes and apply them. Unless you have a really slow network or are sending an insane number of commits, it's not going to take longer than a few seconds.<p>Cloning big repositories (like emacs, with ~25 years of history) can take a while if you have a slow network, but sometimes it feels like git can actually clone a repository faster than SVN can check out a single revision.<p>But repos like emacs' are rare. Often, SVN repositories end up being huge because they contain the code of many unrelated projects. In Git, having such a huge repository is impractical; each project should have its own repository. There is support for submodules though, so you can make a ""master"" repo that contains pointers to the child repositories, if you really have to.",1268987801

The first web app I ever wrote did reporting on NMR machine usage; the users were scientists with advanced degrees and years of teaching (and computing) experience.  The way you specified the date range for reports was via two text fields; the start date and the end date.  Originally, I used a date parser that would accept pretty much any input.  You could say ""yesterday"" to ""today"" or ""4-2000"" to ""9-2005"", etc.  I listed examples in the description text, but I had several users ask me exactly what the date format could be.  When I showed them ""anything"", they were amazed, but claimed it was confusing.<p>I changed the text to read ""specify all dates in YYYYMMDD format, no spaces or slashes"" and everyone loved it afterwards.

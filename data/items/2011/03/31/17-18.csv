2392769,comment,2390980,2391694,3,0,dkarl,,,"I'm a longtime C++ (semicolons everywhere) and Python (no semicolons) programmer who has also used and very much enjoyed Common Lisp and Scheme (no semicolons, but parens everywhere.)  Right now I'm learning Scala (semicolons usually optional but occasionally required.)  After my experience with all those languages, honestly, I don't care at all whether Rust uses semicolons or not.  I like Python's meaningful whitespace, but the lack of semicolons is only a side effect of that, not the primary benefit.  Optional semicolons in Scala actually seem like a bit of a wart since you get used to leaving them out but on rare occasions have to include one to make the code mean what you want.  Putting them in all the time provides a nice visual cue and doesn't cost anything.  Like the parens in Lisp, they disappear as long as they're where you expect them.",1301594383

2392707,comment,2388099,2388099,2,0,rosenjon,,,"I think that these two programs offer starkly different things. A focus on the money alone is very short sighted.<p>ycombinator has established itself as the ""Harvard"" of tech startup incubators. MassChallenge is... well... MassChallenge.<p>As an analogy, when I was deciding between business schools, I had the opportunity to take a scholarship to a lesser MBA program. Or I could pay full price and go to a much higher ranked program. The difference was minimum $50-60k of my own money.<p>I chose to go to the higher ranked program, because of the network that I would be able to build and the long term reputation that came with attending that program. Part of me wishes this wasn't the case; that one's success in life is purely based on their talents and how far they are able to propel themselves on their own steam, regardless of their affiliation with universities or other organizations. Unfortunately, that's not the real world. People care about which organizations you are affiliated with, regardless of whether the education at one is truly better than another. In truth, if you're motivated, you can probably get an equally good education at a community college as you can at an Ivy League school. However, the network you build at these different institutions is vastly different, and I would argue can't be replicated between the two.<p>ycombinator has a track record of producing successful tech startups. This leads to high demand, and the ability to set its own terms. Likening that to ""molestation"" is not only insulting to the program,  but also to all the people who applied to the program (like me). It implies that we don't know what we're doing, and that we are suckers for giving away equity to Y Combinator.

2392682,comment,2391440,2391440,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I think that once again someone inside of Amazon understands the information economy pretty well. This does seem like a lawsuit 'honeypot' (talk about mixed metaphors) since it cannot help but provoke a response (see mp3.com [1])<p>The thing that confuses most people is the emerging doctrine of information sale. What the music companies would like to be true, is that selling you a CD (or an MP3) is equivalent to selling you a ticket to hear the performance once. And as you could not reasonably expect, having bought a ticket to a musical performance, to be able to change the venue for that performance, the industry would like to equate that absurd request to transliterating a recording into a different medium or access method.<p>Consumers on the other hand have expressed a strong belief that they ""own"" that instance of the music and that transliterating it, listening to it from different devices, and/or putting it on a mix tape and having it play as background music for their housewarming party are all 'well within their rights' of things they can do with what they own.<p>The legal tool is of course copyright and many cases have focused on what exactly does it mean to make a copy (which would have been more obvious had the original case against magnetic tape gone the way of the record labels) and what is fair use, and what is the greater good.<p>The motivating force is of course money. Given the physical challenges of having copies and even with tape carrying them around, the record labels were still able to extract a lot of money out of the system. With digital copies and network access it is a lot harder and they can see a time (or fear we are already in it) where the economics don't support the existence of a heavy weight 'middle man' in the music business.<p>Amazon is clearly positioning Cloud Drive with the assumption that the consumer's conceptual model (I bought it I can do what I want with it) is correct. The music companies will counter with ""How can you know they bought it? Maybe they just borrowed it from the library?"" Amazon has a stronger claim if they have a receipt (and its one that Apple uses with iTunes).<p>Best case, Amazon provokes a lawsuit that gives us a bit more clarity, worst case Amazon can only stream music from a Cloud Drive that you've purchased from the Amazon store (and perhaps to only a single IP address). It would not be a bad outcome (for Amazon) if lots of people were willing to re-license their music through Amazon's mp3 store.<p>Perhaps we should start a pool for when the last record label that existed prior to 2000 goes out of business. I strongly believe the outcome is inevitable, only the roughness of the journey is left to ascertain.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techliberation.com/2006/04/19/why-the-mp3com-decision-was-never-appealed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techliberation.com/2006/04/19/why-the-mp3com-decision...</a>",1301593642

Google rode the ""openness"" train to gain philosophical support for Android from the open source community, even though critics pointed out that Apple's strict control has a reason. Now that Google has established a beachhead, they're exerting a kind of control over the platform that goes against the principles they originally espoused and ultimately justifies the very reasoning from Apple that Google and its supporters publicly antagonized for being a ""draconian future.""<p>Furthermore, Honeycomb's source is being withheld, allegedly for quality control reasons. However, Google's privileged partners are allowed access, which means they can start work on Honeycomb products earlier than those without access. That's not an open platform. That's an insular platform of privileged access.<p>The article also states that Google is requiring licensees to agree to clauses that give Google final approval over changes to the operating system. The implication is that if you make changes Google doesn't like, your Android license is at risk. This is supposed to be an open platform with which you are free to do what you want, not some Google platform.<p>Most troubling is the claim that Google is obstructing phones which use Bing. Bing is a Google rival. With Google having the power of final approval, holding up a Bing-using phone reveals the motives behind the Android platform. An Android phone modified to interface with Bing directly affects Google's bottom line. If Android is an open platform, it shouldn't matter if a device manufacturer chooses to go with Bing over Google. But apparently, it does matter to Google.<p>Google has exploited the positive feelings of the phrase ""open source"" for years. The point behind their free services has always been to support the closed source, proprietary search and advertising platform that makes them their money. Now, cracks are beginning to show as their genuine motives begin to influence their public behavior, revealing that Google is just another capitalist.

When Facebook came along, it was a welcome relief from the garish graphics and ""Thanks for the ad!!!1"" wall posts.<p>The real question here is not ""What was it about Myspace, the site, that sucked?"" though. The question is ""What was it about Myspace, the organisation, that prevented it from fixing its sucky site?"" It's probably safe to speculate that Myspace, the organisation, knew that their site sucked and that Facebook's site was better. What held them back from fixing it? Was it clueless management, lack of talented developers or the decision to use a particular technology that doomed them? I don't think that the recent debate has cleared that one up yet.",1301592844

I've read the unfinished SICP in clojure: (http://sicpinclojure.com/?q=sicp/5-1-1-language-describing-register-machines) and through half of the unfinished ebook of ""The Joy of Clojure"" (dead tree version just shipped :)  )<p>What I would like to do now is to try writing some kind of web app. But here I am intimidated. I am not a Java programmer and many of the ""getting started with clojure"" articles I have found loose me by assuming I know how to set up Java webapps.<p>Also, should I use Google App Engine? Some other framework/hosting? I guess I am probably fairly unique in that I want to learn about making webapps through clojure rather than knowing about webapps and trying to apply the lens of clojure to that knowledge. I am excited to learn about tools or frameworks or even other languages that would complement clojure web development, but I feel like I don't know what I don't know, and don't know what I should be reading about and experimenting with.<p>Thanks in advance!",1301592176

But having many more rich people encounters some problems with the size of the whole pie so that I have to doubt that Blank's course can do much!  :-)!!<p>His current statement that entrepreneurship is an ""art"" seems to be an escape to the land where we don't understand artists and don't get blamed for not understanding!<p>Yes, suppose we accept that, except for luck, some 'creativity' is needed for successful entrepreneurship.  Well, my view is that the first 20-30 years of life are not very good for teaching creativity!<p>I finally learned how to be creative in math, but the lessons were not taught or even hinted at in school!  Here's a nutshell recipe:<p>First have to guess the result (theorem) and then have to guess at a good way to confirm (prove) it.  The key is some good guessing.  Here are five points about such guessing:<p>1. Guessing Machine.<p>So, have a 'guessing machine', a bit wild and unconstrained!  To find some really big, new ideas, let the guessing machine be wild!<p>2. Intuitive Models.<p>Have some 'intuitive models'.  Why just intuitive?  Because typically don't know enough yet to make them solid.<p>2.1 Connections.<p>Sometimes two apparently quite different parts of math seem to have a glimmer of something in common, and maybe they do and the glimmer is from something deep and powerful.  Broadly a relatively powerful approach in math is to get to the same result two different ways, thus, showing something in common and getting some new connections.<p>2.2 Patterns.<p>Sometimes work by patterns and analogies:  E.g., once I had a result that said that, along with some other properties, I could have a function differentiable k times for any positive integer k. So, then by a 'pattern', a guess would be that I could still have those other properties and a function infinitely differentiable.  Yup, a few hours later, I did.<p>3. Filtering.<p>3.1 Constraints.  Use what already know is true and is false to constrain or filter guesses.  Be a little flexible and not too literal on the filtering:  Maybe some small changes would make something true now false or something false now true.<p>3.2 Intuitive Models.<p>The intuitive models can be used to filter the results from the guessing machine.  So, maybe guess that A is true.  Then roughly, just intuitively, it looks like maybe B and C are true.  But then D would have to be true, but we know that D is false.  So, if want to invest more time in this guess, then check more carefully that B and C have to follow; otherwise save time for now and guess that A is false.<p>4. Special Cases.<p>Typically do understand some special cases, maybe just some very simple, contrived special cases.  With these can do some more filtering.<p>5. Proofs.<p>So, when have what appears to be a theorem, do some more guessing about how to prove it.  Commonly the guessing that led to the theorem will also help in guessing how to prove it.  In the guesses, be sure actually to make some crucial use of all the hypotheses or just drop any unused hypotheses.  If you are fairly sure that all the hypotheses are needed, then in looking for a proof realize that need a proof that actually uses all the hypotheses.<p>Such means, and likely more, worked for me in being 'creative' in math.  Your mileage may vary!  Adapt, revise, extend, and improve as suits your work!<p>For business in Web 2.0 and 'consumer Internet', sure, need to give the users something they like enough to become ""engaged"" (F.  Wilson).<p>One way to do that is to play on 'art' as in the common definition ""the communication, interpretation of human experience, emotion"".  Look at some examples of art and see how well this definition fits.  More generally, get some understanding of what gets or might get people ""engaged"".  To check ideas, look at examples of where people do get engaged.<p>For guesses at what might get a lot of people engaged, look at someone you know best of all, yourself.  Or, for something less general and simpler, start with a problem you would like to have solved.<p>For how to be as 'creative' as in, say,<p>Notre Dame<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts5t_5HeECE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts5t_5HeECE</a><p>Meditation<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zmgfBKuIrk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zmgfBKuIrk</a><p>Lohengrin<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E</a><p>Tristan und Isolde<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktwPGCR7Yw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fktwPGCR7Yw</a><p>Parsifal<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPn3JV3GHRE&NR=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPn3JV3GHRE&NR=1</a><p>clearly that's doable but more difficult!<p>For more, no doubt the central key is that mechanism we do not know how to explain, human intelligence.  Typically that work is done between two ears in a quiet room considering all that know and can guess, sometimes considers 'causes', and has enough freedom to find some really good, new ideas but enough discipline not to go off into nonsense land.",1301591701

Also somewhat pointed, if you read between the lines, but am not sure if saying ""it was our fault"" was/is legally sound?<p><a href=""http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/samsung-laptops-do-not-have-keylogger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2011/03/samsung-laptops-do-n...</a> (source) [edit to make quote clear]<p>-- quote --<p>GFI LABS Blog: Samsung Laptops do not have a keylogger (and it was our fault)<p>A Slovenian language directory for Windows Live is causing us considerable headaches this morning, and we have no one to blame but ourselves.<p>A Network World article has alleged Samsung laptops of having a keylogger.  Unfortunately (and to our dismay), the evidence was based off of a false positive by VIPRE for the StarLogger keylogger.<p>The detection was based off of a rarely-used and aggressive VIPRE detection method, using folder paths as a heuristic.  I want to emphasize rarely, as these types of detections are seldom used, and when they are, they are subject to an extensive peer review and QA process.  (Its not common knowledge, but folder path detections are actually used by a good number of antimalware products, but are generally frowned upon as a folder that looks clearly like one for malware has the potential of generating just this kind of result  a false positive.)<p>The directory in question was C:\WINDOWS\SL, and is the Slovenian language directory for Windows Live.  This same directory path is used by the StarLogger keylogger.<p>How does this happen?   A researcher has a number of tools at his or her disposal to detect a piece of malware.  These include a broad range of detection types based on the malware in question. Sometimes, a simple signature is fine; other times, a more carefully crafted detection is needed.  In VIPRE, among some of the detection types are heuristic (meaning, using a method of pattern analysis on the file); behaviorial  (looking at the behaviour of a file in VIPRE's emulator to see if it does anything malicious) or signature-based (simply creating a file signature for the file).  Part of the heuristic toolkit used might be any number of types of analyses, and these can include looking at the contents of the file for specific patterns that indicate malware.  A researcher can also (but rarely) use a folder path as part of a more comprehensive detection set.  Imagine you're a researcher:  You see the folder name ""C:\windows\sl"".  This is, indeed, something one would never find on a Windows system at the time the detection was written, so the researcher added this folder path to his heuristics for this keylogger.  It was peer-reviewed and tested against a broad range of Windows platforms, including every foreign language set.  Everything is fine and dandy... except that at some point several years after the original detection was written, Windows Live started using that directory to install Slovenian language files for Windows Live.  Samsung started pre-installing Windows Live, including all the languages, and there you have the problem we're having today.<p>We apologize to the author Mohamed Hassan, to Samsung, as well as any users who may have been affected by this false positive.<p>False positives do happen, its inevitable and like all antivirus companies, we continually strive to improve our detections, while reducing any chance of a false positive.  This one (admittedly, an incredibly embarrassing one) made it through our processes, and I have met with the senior managers in the area this morning to handle what happened and to continue to improve our processes.<p>The false detection is fixed in definition set 8878.<p>Alex Eckelberry\nGeneral Manager, GFI Security",1301591427

Her point isn't that we should to make math classes easier so that people feel good about math; her point is that students might be more interested in math class if it contained some mathematics.<p>The primary aim of math class up through calculus is to teach kids to perform the calculations needed to do physics, which is needed to do engineering, which is generally perceived (correctly I think) to be greatly beneficial to society.  This is fine, but there is a huge chasm between this and the types of things that actual mathematicians study.  (My brother once commented that if people had any idea what was actually going on in the math department, there is no way in hell they'd fund it).<p>The best counter to Vi's point, I think, is ""why would we want to make kids appreciate pure math?""  It's really fun and really interesting, and personally I would love for more people to get to experience math, but I'm sure the same could be said of classical music, or poetry, or knitting or pretty much anything else that people find stimulating.

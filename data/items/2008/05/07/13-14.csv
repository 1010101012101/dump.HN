183356,comment,183340,183340,0,0,mark-t,,,"For me, it's mostly avoiding the hassle of commercializing something. If I'm never going to try to sell it, I might as well give away the source. Also, there's not really much choice when a lot of what you do is in perl or ruby or ... -- just about anything but c/c++.<p>How I got started is another story. I switched to linux because windows drove me crazy. Then Gnome and KDE drove me crazy. Then xfce drove me crazy. It became apparent that I had very specific needs, and nothing available was going to fill them. So, I chose something close to what I wanted (fluxbox) and started fixing things. Thus, I guess you could say I started because I'm picky.",1210168589

After a couple months of just keeping your ears open and taking notes you end up with a pretty long list.<p>That said, just repeating our list wouldn't do you a lot of good; usually you're looking for people that are either in your area or that you have at least some distant connection to.  Think you don't have connections?  Yeah, so did we.  Then we started paying closer attention over a period of time and realized we had quite a few.",1210168030

Actually, I disagree with your statement as written.<p>""Programs with short methods are easy to understand"" \nexpresses that the set of programs with short methods is a subset of the set of all programs that are easy to understand.<p>Therefore, every program with short methods is easy to understand, or (easy to understand) if (short methods), or (short methods) -> (easy to understand).<p>I was expressing that it there exists a very large set of programs with short methods that are not easy to understand.<p>To make these statements less subject to procedural wrangling, given a particular working program, the set of all possible permutations and refactorings that produce the same output contains many permutations with short methods that are not easy to understand.",1210167867

I wrote that they would love to be able to compete with Amazon on price and that if they could get it from the labels on the same terms as Amazon, they woul doffer it at the same or lower price.<p>As for free iPods, I don't remember writing that either. That being said, lots of companies work very hard at making their products less expensive in order to occupy mor eof the market. Last time I checked, Apple has offered a variety of iPods over a very broad spread of prices, from shuffle to iPod touch 32GB. Cheap iPods = no oxygen for competitors at the low end.<p>That's a perfectly normal business strategy, isn't it?<p>""you can copy it freely on your own devices, but you can not sell it on ebay. The ebay factor is something I still don't see factored into the prices for online music (it should be cheaper than CDs, because I can sell a CD once I get tired of it).""<p>That is a novel and interesting point.

And I love that the fanboys are selling, nonstop, with all their heart.<p>It's that the Apple fanboys are <i>boring</i>. It's like hearing the same song, over and over. And it's not a good song, it's like hearing ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" or something.<p>If the fanboys could admit that Apple stuff isn't totally perfect, and there actually are better alternatives depending on people's needs, that would lend a lot of credibility to their argument.<p>I was one of the first people to get an iPod and hop onto the ITMS bandwagon.

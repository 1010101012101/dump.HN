Apple owns its own retail stores, and those stores are competition for Best Buy.  But Apple isn't really in the <i>business</i> of retail; they have no reason to stop you from buying Macs and iPads at Best Buy.  Retail is just a channel for Apple's real business, and its to their advantage to push their product through the channels they own <i>and</i> the channels they don't.<p>The browser is a channel for Google's core business of search advertising.  Like Apple, they get some benefits from building and controlling a distribution channel of their own.

You can certainly <i>teach</i> someone to program--what they do after that defines the rest of their career. No CS curriculum will give all the information one needs to be a <i>great</i> programmer, but it's certainly possible to have a long and mediocre career as a <i>taught</i> programmer.<p>I would wager a majority of the best programmers are <i>also</i> self-taught, though. Not because College is a bad experience or sets you up for failure, but because it's really internal motivation and curiosity that makes a programmer grow, not something they learned in a CS course once upon a time.

I see restaurants advertising for tourists all the time. Look in any in-flight magazine or any of the free guidebooks that are given away in tourist areas. They're full of ads and coupons for tours, restaurants, museums and attractions. That's a business model worth investigating.<p>The downside is it's a real boots-on-the-ground business that requires a heavy investment in sales effort to make it work. The upside is that once you sign up a customer (assuming they have a positive experience) it is highly likely they will repeat.

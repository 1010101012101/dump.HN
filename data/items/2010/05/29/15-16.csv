1388848,comment,1387499,1388026,0,0,Alex63,,,"I'm certainly not arguing against free speech (I think if you read my earlier posts you will see that I did not suggest that), which is why I suggested that an economic disincentive was probably the only effective way to stop this kind of behavior.<p>Since you bring up the question of free speech, however, let's consider that angle. Does the right to free speech give you the right to shout ""fire!"" in a crowded movie theatre?  Or to perjure yourself? No, and presumably the reason is because such speech reflects a malicious intent to  cause harm to others. I don't suppose for an instant that Oprah has such a malicious intent, but I think most HN readers would agree that by giving celebrities and quacks a platform from which to spread their stupidity, she does cause harm to others.<p>In <i>The Ethics of Belief</i>, W. K. Clifford said ""It is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence."" If you accept Clifford's reasoning (as I do), then I think we must agree that Oprah is wrong to believe as she does, and further compounds that error by spreading her beliefs widely. While it is not illegal to be wrong, I don't think it would be a huge stretch to suggest that persons spreading beliefs that they have no right to believe (per Clifford) are culpable at some level for the resulting harm.  As far as I know, the fact that the speaker honestly believes what they are saying is no defense in cases of libel, slander or hate speech.<p>My view is that Oprah has a duty to question her beliefs, and seek out evidence that refutes them.  If she chooses not to do so, she is still entitled to hold those beliefs privately, but not to encourage them in others.",1275148283

Long-term:  A lot of would-be users that would have signed up, won't.<p>* Short-term:  Revised privacy controls ease the pain.  Long-term:  Permanent brand damage has happened.

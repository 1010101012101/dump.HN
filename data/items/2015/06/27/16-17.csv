Over the past year I was tickling the idea of making an organization/company/website which automatically would give tax dollars to research. The idea being, you can maximize the amount you right off in taxes and donate to research you desire (i.e. more NASA, less children killed around the globe).<p>The idea stemmed from the the idea that people want access to research (public) AND reproducible. The funds would go directly to research groups, and as an incentive, reproducibility would have bounties based on what people were willing to donate. Because virtually every research group with public research is supported by a non-profit, no one losses additional money, but more funds go towards public interest research GROUPS not organizations with bureaucracy.<p>Somewhat off topic, but this seems another reason for me to start the project.",1435424331

More, I expect.<p>So, for example, if I had a team of Computer Science graduates, I might wonder if they&#x27;re all thinking about problems through the lens of their classes on algorithms and data-structures and so forth, and maybe a mathematician would think about these same problems in a different way.<p>If I had a team with a lot of people from global defence industry megacorps used to spending a decade on a project and ensuring that all reqts are solid up front, I might think that someone from a startup might bring a different approach to the software life-cycle (and, of course, vice-versa).<p>Adding another person to a team who thinks the same just gives me more of the same.

9790730,comment,9789729,9789729,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Highly secure messaging, email, and Internet services has a long history in military and defense sector with issues well-understood. I mention here [1] the framework I used in high assurance security engineering. The system must be built using strongest engineering techniques with the right requirements. It must run on an endpoint with specialist security engineering techniques resistant to talented hackers. The protocols, parsers, networking stacks, and so on must be <i>carefully</i> implemented to prevent problems. Modern attackers are hitting various firmware, too, so protection is needed from devices. Then, we must be sure the software displayed to us for all this is what&#x27;s actually running, on non-subverted hardware, and with non-malicious insiders.<p>The whole thing is beyond tricky to the point that no hosted service is rated to high security in any honest way (eg outside hand-waiving arguments). The only proven model has standalone apps (eg PGP, Nexor Sentinel) acting as proxies between trusted mail/messaging apps and untrusted side. Ideally, user-controlled, vetted code handles secrets with untrusted side (eg Internet host) simply a transport or storage layer that has no influence on endpoint or security past availability. The trusted software must also run on strong endpoints that don&#x27;t run any other risky software. Given target market, that disqualifies most users of email and messaging software in general.<p>So, about this one. It seems to not meet many of these requirements and its users don&#x27;t either. That puts it in Low-Medium assurance category where it might still be helpful against regular black hats, snoops, and attackers without 0-days in what their users have. That will necessarily require decent design & implementation. I commend them on having it pen-tested & open-sourced for review to that effect.<p>Meanwhile, users wanting to increase resistance to High Strength Attackers should use air gapped, hardened NIX boxes with GPG or Markus Ottela&#x27;s Tinfoil Chat. Snowden leaks showed using GPG correctly, esp with Tor correctly, gave NSA hell. Markus has also improved TFC many times in response to our critiques to the point that many attack vectors are impossible, risk is lower in others, and endpoint risks are possibly lower than all solutions if right hardware is used. Still work to be done but he&#x27;s way ahead of the competition.<p>Note: I second rossjudson that the site, although with beautiful artwork, should be redesigned so it&#x27;s clear what the app does without a lot of digging. I&#x27;ve seen competing apps where they were clear on the specifics upfront while still not drowning readers in technical detail. The technical detail was a link or so away if I needed it. Right not, it looks too much like a marketing team&#x27;s work.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-ma.html#c1102869"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/01/essay_on_fbi-...</a>",1435424194

And go directly to 2 problems:<p>* There exists cases in which latin1 & utf8 are mangled in a same string. (ex http/SIP headers are latin1 and content can be utf8 and you may want to store a full HTTP/SIP transaction verbatim for debugging purpose), and it can store in iso-latin3 (code table for esperanto to be sarcastic), but will explode in utf8 unless you rencode it (B64)<p>* tools are partly UTF8 compliant: mysql (which is as good as PHP in terms of quality) is clueless about UTF8 (hint index and collation), and PHP too <a href=""https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=18556"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=18556</a> <--- THIS BUG TOOK 10 YEARS TO BE CLOSED<p>The whole point is developer don&#x27;t understand the organic nature of culture, and especially of its writing and the diversity of culture.<p>They think that because some rules applies in their language it also applies in others: BUT<p>* PHP devs: lowercase of I is not always i (it can be i without a dot). It took 10 years to the dev to find where their bug was!\n* shortening a memory representation does not always shorten its graphical representation (apples bug with sms in arabian)\n* sort orders are not immutable (collation not only can vary from language to language but also according to the administrative context (ex: proper name in french))\n* inflexions are hell and text size for error varies a lot (hence the unstability of windows 95 in french because error message where copied in a reserved page and the fixed size was less than the whole size of the domain&#x27;s corpus... hence any contiguous block in memory (lower xor upper bound) would have its memory potentially corrupted)).<p>My point is UTF8 is not hell. Real world is complex. And it becomes hell when some dumb devs thinking that by manipulating strings that represents any language they know about any language.. and apply universal rules that are not.<p>Some problems can be solved by ignoring them. But with culture it is not the case.<p>And actually, unicode SUX because it is US centrics<p>* computers should be able to store all our pasts books and make them available for the future, even in verbatim mode.

We are introducing type setting rules in unicode.<p>For those who have used tex since a long time, the non separation of the almost programmatical typography and the graphens is like not separing the model and the controller.<p>Which actually also calls for the view (the effection) and thus the fonts. Having the encoding of the Slong does not tell you what it looks like unless you have a canonical representation of the codepoint as a graphem.<p>And since we are printing/creating document for juridical purpose we may like to control the view that ensures that the mapping of the string representation will not alter graphical representation in a way that can compromise its meaning. If someone signs in a box you don&#x27;t want the signature to alter the representation anywhere or worse without notice.<p>The devil lies in the detail.

It currently only just fits under the cuff, any thicker and it would be far too thick. In a dress watch, thinness is truly very important.<p>But whilst I&#x27;ve heard this argument a lot, I&#x27;m surprised people are even considering it. Do they really think it will make a big improvement to the battery? I feel like the space used filling it with automatic charging tech could be better used if filled with extra battery. In addition, it turned out that the reported poor battery life of the Apple Watch was just FUD and that since launch, there have been very few (if any?) complaints.<p>Notification spam is another common false complaint. If you are bothered by notifications, that&#x27;s your fault. The settings are very granular. You can use VIP in mail, if you&#x27;re getting too much email, and disable as many notifications as you wish - there is no problem here.<p>Finally, the author complains that the Apple Watch will never be timeless, then straps on a Casio G-Shock.

Why aren&#x27;t we using this same logic and not questioning it at all?<p>Arguably, because correctly counting votes in a close election is a valid and relevant exercise, whereas counting foreign relatives isn&#x27;t.<p>>I will tell you why: political bias. When it comes to anything against the liberal mainstream, it&#x27;s questioned heavily..but with really glaring issues like Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails that suddenly vanished, it&#x27;s excused and brushed under the carpet.<p>Fair enough. But it would be disingenuous to ignore the extreme political bias behind the issue of Obama&#x27;s birth certificate in the first place.<p>According to my (admittedly cursory) research, no Presidential candidate has ever released their birth certificate since Chester A. Arthur, notwithstanding those who never had one. Yet, this was not an issue before Obama, and it will likely magically cease to be an issue after Obama (as it already has with Ted Cruz), because the controversy was manufactured entirely in the name of political bias, not fairness or due diligence on the part of Obama&#x27;s political opponents.<p>>He has lots of family in Kenya and he kept it very much a secret.<p>How did he keep it &quot;very much&quot; a secret in any way that differs from other candidates keeping their personal lives &quot;very much&quot; a secret?<p>> His University transcripts are still pretty much locked up.<p>Obama is not unusual in this regard. Bush&#x27;s transcripts are only public now because they were leaked.<p>>I&#x27;m about equality..and you are just being a dick. This is the difference.<p>Why not be upset then that Trump refuses to play by his own standards? For that matter, why be suspicious at all when Barack Obama ran his candidacy under the same standard of carefully orchestrated PR as practically every other candidate in US history?<p>I&#x27;ll concede to being a dick, but i&#x27;m not running for anything.",1435421189

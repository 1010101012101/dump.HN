Why? One of the multiple reasons is that my Grandfather served and retired as a Colombian Supreme Court Justice, I have had a few talks with him over shots of that sugarcane hooch they like here, and the corruption on behalf of the Colombian gov AND the Americans down here is downright astonishing.<p>The gov and pharma and defense contractors ARE in cahoots in America. All you have to do is look!<p>The only solution short of vaccination (I understand there is a cocaine vaccine in the works) OR (my favorite idea) creating a biological agent that sets off a major crop disease which eradicates most of the coca plants - the only solution is to legalize, the problem is, you do that and no more clandestine crates full of 100 dollar bills for anyone in the US, Mexico, Colombia govs.<p>There is actually quite a bit of literature, from credible sources (some former high ranking LE) anyone that cares to look further into the topic most certainly can.<p>Ok, goodbye thread, now I'm getting worked up remembering some of the greasy illiterates (and their whores) driving BMW's that I have had minor run ins with down here with, ALL BECAUSE PROHIBITION ALLOWS SUCH SUBHUMANS TO PROFIT.",1236592599

508185,comment,508132,508132,0,0,silversun,,,"I am awfully new to this game, but I do recall seeing a url shortener which enabled additional tracking to the initiating user. For example, showing the time distribution of the clicks along with originating sites. I may be stretching this a bit far, but just for the heck of it, if I wanted to figure out which social networking website had a larger pull for me in distributing information, this type of service would allow me to do that. (don't ask me why? :) )<p>The way I would build a business model around a URL shortener would be through those types of value add services which would draw users back to the site (ad-revenue, or potentially in-depth ""pay"" analytics), in addition to the already-mentioned resultant data insights.",1236591790
508184,comment,507920,507920,0,0,spyrosk,,,"Although I can't find the article anymore (I'm almost certain that it was posted here) I remember reading that, as far as small handheld cameras are concerned, there appears to be a limit to the number of megapixels they can have without suffering from ""digital noise"". It appears to be around 6 MP. Above that ""ideal"" area noise reducing algorithms have to be employed to keep the quality relatively stable.
This phenomenon is caused due to the small area of the lens (sorry if this term is not correct for digital cameras) and the electronic properties of the light sensitive board.<p>The above applies only to small handheld cameras, larger/more expensive models, ie DSLR's, do not suffer from this.",1236591706

508182,comment,507266,508065,0,0,cturner,,,"I think that's right. Since the early days there have been lots of people willing to say (from an academic bent) how python is basically just scheme, and (from a practical bent) how the likes of python+libraries is good enough to make scheme unnecessary. Programming in scheme feels very different to scheme, largely because of the neutered lambda.",1236591507
508181,comment,507467,507942,0,0,pz,,,"convex optimization covers a lot of different problem types.  in general, you are trying to minimize (or maximize) some function (the objective function) over a set of variables subject to a set of constraints on those variables.  'convex optimization' deals specifically with optimization problems where the objective function is... convex.  this essentially means you can efficiently find the global minimum (or maximum if the function is concave)<p>ok, so a simple example: lets say you're on a hacker's budget and you want to maximize your caloric intake given your limited funds.  This is your objective function.  BUT, if you're like me, you can't live on ramen and mountain dew... i have a basic set of nutritional requirements.  These are your constraints.  For example, sodium has to be less than A and protein greater than B and so on and so forth.  So you are essentially optimizing over ALL possible diets.<p>My guess is you'd end getting back: kale, potatoes and beans.  Now that's a real hacker's diet!",1236591401
508180,comment,508138,508138,0,0,david927,,,"Interesting article. Thanks.<p>What I find fascinating is that the Dollar is not being shorted.  At this point, everyone knows the US is no longer AAA, and interest rates are effectively zero.  In a normal setting, the dollar would drop like a stone.  It hasn't yet for the reason the article mentions, but it's pretty clear it will -- and soon.  So to me, this seems to be an opportunity of a lifetime, to short the dollar with gold, silver, Singapore Dollars, etc.  Am I crazy?",1236591172

The more an article is flagged, I presume, the more it stands out to their attention. They then make a manual decision whether to kill the article - and can even bring it back if they change their mind (I've seen that happen a few times).<p>So flagging in and of itself does not trigger any automatic removal of the article.

""Relentlessly resourceful"" founders are able to help themselves, strong, and independent.<p>I know you disagree with the dictionary definition, but could it be that the two meanings merged in your mind? They're not really merged in mine... I see ""hapless"" as relating to luck, whereas helpless is relating to ability. It seems unnecessary to propose a new meaning for ""hapless"" when ""helpless"" fits the bill perfectly.<p>Handily enough, the antonyms of ""helpless"" are: ( <a href=""http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/helpless"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/helpless</a> )<p>able, capable, competent, enterprising, independent, <i>resourceful</i>, skilled, strong<p>Which seems to be exactly what you're aiming for. On the other hand, the antonyms of ""hapless"" are: "" fortuitous, fortunate, lucky, well-off"", which is not really what you mean, I imagine.<p></niggle>",1236589540

Increasing the number of people increases the number of samples. Loosely speaking, increasing the number of samples will reduce the variance on the variable you are measuring. When the variance is reduced, the confidence in the result is increased.<p>Say you are measuring IQ before and after taking omega 3. Say your hypthesis is ""omega 3 immedieately increases IQ"". Assume this is true, even if it probably isn't. After testing this on 20 people you might be able to say ""the hypthesis appears to be true, but there is a 46% percent chance these results are due to chance"". However after testing 1000 people, you might be able to say ""the hypthesis appears to be true, and there is a 0.5% percent chance these results are due to chance"". Then you are 99.5% confident in your result. Standards for confidence varies from field to field, but typically 99% confidence or more is called a significant result. Given some assumptions, you can also calculate the number of samples needed to generate a result with confidence >X% with probability Y. According to Daniel Kahneman in Thinking Fast and Slow, most researchers don't take the time to do this, and are consistently surprised when their experiments turn out to not give significant results.",1347551555

The ebay website looks very old-fashioned  and the old logo fits right in there. If they want to change their logo they have to do more than change gifs on their website. Maybe thats planned, I dont know.<p>If they want to change, their new logo (and the linked page, too) indicates that they want to change to a minimalist, simple design with few elements and lots of whitespace. Im honestly not sure whether that fits the brand or makes for a very good ebay experience.<p>ebay  to me at least  has always been about cheap prices and selling stuff you no longer need to other people. Like a flea market, only more useful. (Hm, but maybe they want to change that perception of ebay?) Do I want it to look super serious and professional? Im not sure.

I imagine it's a lot more difficult to recruit ultra-talented hackers, especially since they are totally unqualified to recognize them.

If you are not as comfortable in front of pure business personnel, as you are technical people you need to get comfortable in that environment. If you could not see yourself doing well as a technical sales engineer, then you need to work on your ability to pitch concepts. While many of us would never take the role of a sales engineer, you must know that you could do well at the job if you did pursue it. The reason being, as a consultant you are a sales engineer. The more reputable you become, the higher up the corporate ladder you sell at. Large firms don't sell to middle management, they call their friend on the board up and strike a deal with the board, they work out implementation details with middle management. Thriving in the non-technical environments is paramount to greater success. Which brings me to the last point, and that is network, good consultants have a network, you have to network and not just you local users groups, you need to network at small business events and other industry groups. If you are not great at getting up in front of people, tostmasters is a great place to network, a good deal of those attending tostmasters are doing so because they are moving up the ladder and have to become comfortable speaking to larger and larger groups, some may be future decision makers.",1347550749

But a more modest definition-- for example, of compute-enabled ""smart"" versions of already-existing products-- may make that vision possible.  Thinking of sensors as a form of meaningful computation expands the range even more.<p>For example, I've seen switches that harvest enough energy from the act of pressing them, to communicate their change in status to the controlled device.  Now consider coupling that energy to some logic.  For example, maybe a single light switch dynamically determines which of several lights you want to switch on or off in the space.<p>The real barrier to ""ubiquitous meaningful low-energy computation"" is that the marginal extra energy for adding computation to an existing device must be small compared to the energy that device already draws.  The classic example of this is automobiles, which have been acquiring more and more sensors and internal control logic over the years.  As logic components get to lower energy consumption, why shouldn't those possibilities jump to other devices?<p>The following, related, analysis was posted to HN a while ago:

Sure Firefox and Linux are open source(and I love them for that), but what about online apps? User does not have any control over the web page. If web page changes or disappears he can do nothing(and it can happen with no warning). Storing local copy of webpage may not be possible(because huge part of app may be on server side). Even proprietary desktop apps are better[1] because they do not change on each startup and you could always try to reverse engineer them. Web app also can store user data on server giving him no way to recover and it gives more spoofing opportunities. 
Sure we can try to teach users about to choose open source web pages, or pages that can work in offline mode, but unfortunately most web pages does not fit these categories.<p>I'm impressed by what Firefox OS managed to achieve using web technologies, but I posted this as a warning that users may chain themselves to some proprietary webapp even stronger than to native one. Hopefully Firefox Os will force more webapps to provide offline mode.<p>[1] Of course DRM tries to take away this advantage from desktop apps.",1347549650

A good body is a totally unfair advantage.  Yet this is not cheating.  Similarly some people are just brighter, smarter and less lazy than others.  They will breeze through while others must sweat tears and blood if they ever hope to enter college.  This is even more unfair, yet it is still not cheating.<p>The reason dope is officially cheating in sports is because they are a breach of explicit rules.  It is the same as removing an enemy pawn when no one is looking.  You could perfectly have sports where the use of dope were permitted (I'm not sure I would endorse it though: it may have unhealthy consequences oh, wait it <i>did</i>).<p>Now college entrance exams are about selecting students smart enough to make it through the curriculum, and make a worthy career afterwards.  Ideally, you'd want to select those most likely to succeed.  My take is this: any way to deceive that predictor is cheating.  Anything else is not.  By this analysis, nootropics are cheating only to the extent they deceive the predictor.  My bet is that someone willing to take such drugs to go to college will probably continue to do so later (permanently or when needed).  In this case, the drug doesn't fool the predictor, it actually helps being a little smarter <i>in the long term</i>. What would be cheating would be to take the drugs for a <i>short term</i> benefit, then never or rarely do that again.<p>Finally, this really is not a zero-sum game.  Even if only an elite 1% take those drugs, even if it does make things even more unfair than they already are, those people may solve problems faster for the rest of us, so we all benefit.  And boy do we have problems that need solving.<p>Starting with Death.[1]<p>(One last detail: nootroopics also have to work and not have nasty side effects.

1. Google App Engine will continue to play a major role in Go's development.
2. The speed of development in Go is equal to or exceeds that of other dynamic languages. Static typing takes minimal  extra time and immediately pays off by catching silly errors, then continues to ease development (and documentation) in the future.
3. Go's standard library already contains powerful tools to develop web apps.<p>It's important to remember that Go is still very young. Could you explain why you still prefer Python over Go?",1347549010

4516481,comment,4515864,4515864,64,0,tokenadult,,,"The article begins with ""Its a lengthy read, but dont let the wall of text dissuade you."" That's scary right there. Anyone who is scared off by this short, popular fluff piece needs a lot of help in reading (or is not a native speaker of English). To learn to read a piece like this thoughtfully and critically mostly takes practice in reading, not the latest ""smart drug."" I've been hearing people tout smart drugs for as long as I have been involved in online discussions (since 1992), and I have never seen any evidence of regular users of smart drugs doing anything smart.<p>Let's learn from how an indisputably smart person (LISP hacker and genuine NASA rocket scientist Peter Norvig, now Google's director of research) approaches claims of a new wonder drug. He writes of ""Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation""<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>in a free online article that is also a wall of text, but which any Hacker News reader could read and apply to become more smart in day-by-day life. We can learn together by comparing the popular article kindly submitted here to the checklist of warning signs provided by Peter Norvig.<p>Warning Sign D1: Lack of a Randomized Controlled Trial<p>The article about ""smart drugs"" submitted here doesn't cite any scientific literature from any country and makes no reference to results from randomized, controlled trials. As another participant here has already pointed out in a smart comment,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4516111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4516111</a><p>the author of the article's main text is in the business of selling smart drugs. He is not a neutral, objective source of information on the subject. He doesn't seem willing to share his evidence base for his claims, perhaps because he has none.<p>Warning Sign D2: Lack of Double-Blind Studies<p>The author refers to people taking various drugs while being aware of what they are taking, which skews their recollection of their performance and very likely results in invalid recollections. Most SCIENTIFIC studies of mental performance interventions are careful to be ""double blind"" and to have neither the subject nor the experimenter aware of which subject received the studied intervention and which received a sham intervention. And such studies have careful tests of mental performance (working memory, IQ, or the like). The article here is mere advertising puffery by comparison.<p>Warning Sign D3: Too Few Subjects<p>The author advertising smart drugs doesn't describe any careful studies, so of course he doesn't mention the number of subjects in any studies. Most so-called studies of smart drugs have been far too small to have any statistical power.<p>Warning Sign D4: The Wrong Subjects<p>People voluntarily self-administering smart drugs are VERY likely not a representative sample of the general population. If some people self-report that they became smarter after using the drugs (do their friends and relatives agree?), that by no means shows that most people will be better off if they take the drugs. Random assignment to the treatment condition from among a representative sample is necessary to show that the drugs have any general or consistent benefit.<p>Warning Sign D5: The Wrong Questions<p>Most of the supposed tests of smart drugs appear to use mere user self-reports rather than standardized measures of mental performance that show up in the scientific literature on psychology. Simply put, no high-quality treatise on human intelligence<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/IntelligenceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Intellige...</a><p>has ever reported that smart drugs are good for anything.<p>Warning Sign D6: The Wrong Statistics<p>Again, most statements about smart drugs found online have no statistics at all. In any event, what studies there have been about smart drugs that use the language of statistical analysis have mostly been very amateurish in their statistical approach.<p>Warning Sign D7: Lack of a Specific Hypothesis, or Overzealous Data Mining<p>Before the user begins taking a smart drug, is the expected effect ""creativity,"" or ""memory"" or cognition, or what? The article, by its incoherence in grouping drugs by their supposed effects, shows that most of the time people who have sunk money into smart drugs are expected to imagine their own benefits, and will, to avoid embarrassment at being snookered.<p>Warning Sign D8: Lack of a Theory<p>The human brain is a very complicated biological system, with many feedback loops, and so far there is no mainstream theory of neurophysiology (a topic with MANY investigators all over the world) that suggests simple chemical interventions to produce long-term improvement in any aspect of mental performance.<p>Warning Sign D9: Lack of controls<p>It's not clear in the smart drug promotional literature even what should be controlled if there were a controlled trial of smart drugs. The smart drug promoters are not making enough effort to contrast taking smart drugs with other interventions (say, learning to read more challenging reading material by practice) that likely have better impact on long-term mental performance.<p>Warning Sign I1: Lacking Repeatability and Reproducibility<p>The author basically acknowledges that many smart drugs have results that are not reproducible reliably.<p>Warning Sign I2: Ignoring Publication Bias<p>Because smart drug trials are not announced in advance in publicly readable databases, every person selling smart drugs gets to announce unverifiable anecdotes while hiding in the file drawer all the cases in which smart drugs failed.<p>Warning Sign I3: Ignoring Other Sources of Bias<p>The smart drug promoters make no effort to subject smart drug claims to the statistical tests that in recent years have revealed many incorrect claims in published scientific literature on other subjects. Because the smart drug claim is an extraordinary claim, smart drug promoters should produce extraordinary evidence to back up the claim.<p>I'll skip Norvig's next warning sign, as the following one<p>Warning Sign I5: Taking p too Seriously<p>is more relevant for the claims here. There is NO indication that smart drugs have any real-world significance (in other words, that people actually live smarter lives after taking them) as contrasted with claimed (but unreported here) instances of the drugs having ""statistically significant"" effects.<p>The last few checklist items on Norvig's checklist<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>are also worth looking at in connection with claims about smart drugs.<p>To sum up, I am willing to do a mental test (memory, or IQ, as the smart drug promoter chooses) duel with anyone who claims that smart drugs have helped him become smarter. I don't believe it, because I don't think there is sufficient evidence to back up that extraordinary claim. If anyone wants to set up the duel, we should each choose ""seconds"" to negotiate the terms of the mental test duel. I would, of course, insist on a series of STANDARDIZED mental tests administered by a psychologist with a lot of clinical experience. I don't expect any user of smart drugs to win such a duel.<p>AFTER EDIT: Responding to the first two replies received, there are standard methods in statistics for estimating adequate sample sizes based on expected effect size of the intervention. There isn't any one best sample size that fits all experimental studies, but a careful experimenter will calculate what sample size is large enough to maximize likelihood of meaningful results (statistical power) while minimizing the expense of gathering lots of subjects for the experiment. My proposal for a duel is, of course, a sample size of 1 plus the number of smart drug users who come forth to take the duel, and has other problems as a data-gathering measure, but I offer the duel to illustrate that I think that anyone can improve in smarts, for any real-world purpose, in a lot of ways that are better than taking poorly understood drugs pushed by smart drug hucksters.",1347548666

Accordingly, we enabled the installation and removal of server GUI components from the command line, PowerShell, and within Server Manager. In addition, we created over 2,300 PowerShell cmdlets to enable command-line and remote management of all server roles. We also introduced enhancements to Server Core itself to increase application compatibility; for example, the full .NET Framework 4.5 is now available out of the box on Server Core.</i><p>As a Unix guy myself I'm not particularly attracted towards Windows Server, but I think it's worth noting that Microsoft has been working hard for nearly a decade now to make Windows more componentized and command-line friendly (see ""MinWin"": <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinWin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinWin</a>), and I applaud them for doing so.

While this will help to some extent, I do not think it will solve the underlying problem. Web developers are accustomed to creating whatever interfaces they like with little regard to usability considerations including consistency with other websites. Different colours, typography, borders, page structures, navigation styles, etc between websites and applications produces a difficult user experience.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.5/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.gnome.org/hig-book/3.5/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/usere...</a>",1347548464

4516457,comment,4497461,4514411,1,0,larrys,,,"Thanks for the insightful reply which I will read again to fully digest.<p>One thing I wanted to add though on the issue of your costs increasing and the ""retail"" market. The retail market hates to switch (as much as you hate to move colo) and will stay with their current solution to avoid having to make changes (and that goes for the ""tech"" guy that works for the retail customer it's not to his benefit to switch hosting if he can simply pass the cost on to his customer or his customer pays directly).<p>So while your costs increase on a wholesale level the amount your customers can and will pay will increase as a much larger number. (If you want.)<p>I would explore a deal with your landlord that allows you to pay him a % for your success which takes the uncertainty out of your costs. This is similar to what is done at a shopping mall. The tenant pays for ""sales"" in addition to a base. While it might seem counter intuitive to do a deal like this I know I wouldn't want the uncertainty of pricing increasing and having to be negotiated in real time. That way your interest and that of the landlord are in line. And anything can be negotiated.<p>Generally in retail realty, a store will sign a lease and have options to renew at a preset rate that protects them. Starbucks doesn't sign a lease nor does the local pizza shop and then be held hostage. They do agree (nnn lease) though to cover any increase in costs that the landlord has in taxes etc which the tenant knows can be verified and make sense. Generally. It won't be a deal where the landlord sees they are successful and then makes a decision that they can't move and they play this game and jacks up the rent. That is what appears to be happening with your situation so I would work to get around that.<p>I'd be glad to do strategy with you on this further if you want. Feel free to contact me.",1347548417

Some of the changes that Twitter introduced were good for normal users (especially about embedded clients) - but I still have tens of thousands of people using my service. Presumably because it offers something which the ""official"" one doesn't.<p>I would expect Twitter to try and work with me.  Twitter Cards, for example, aren't available through the API.<p>Why does Twitter need a unified experience? Email doesn't have one. Nor does any other form of communication.<p>Twitter could have asked us to show their ads, or charged us for API use, or asked for community funding, or any of a hundred different way to keep developers and users happy.<p>It comes down to respect.  They've nothing but contempt for the people who helped them get where they are.  And that's sad.",1347548411

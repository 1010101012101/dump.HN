In the &#x27;80s the party platform dropped support for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.<p>Also, religious groups that were traditionally very liberal/voted Democrat (e.x. Catholics) on social issues also broke off from the Democrats over abortion and reproductive rights related issues over the course of the &#x27;80s, which isn&#x27;t to say they were specifically /for/ those things at any point, they just became something more political in the &#x27;80s.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t really have said that 1991 was a clear date for the &#x27;start&#x27; of that process, though.  Perhaps more &quot;When it got into full swing.&quot;  The other thing is that the loss of large groups like the Catholics and the involvement of the Christian Right in general caused the Democrats to swing right as well, which means that even when the Dems were in power in the &#x27;90s their attitudes and the policies they enacted were often more conservative than they had been before RE: women&#x27;s lib/rights/etc., even if they still supported most of the issues on paper.",1419303123

8786568,comment,8784210,8785355,0,0,phil21,,,"It&#x27;s not simply having enough aggregate capacity though either.  The way anycast works is that a host will take the shortest network path to the closest server.<p>So for example (very high-level) you might have a server in the US, and one in Europe.  If your are eating a DDoS attack maybe the botnet has tons of US-based IPs, but very few euro.  In that scenario, you will have all your US customers down but the EU guys are just fine.<p>That&#x27;s pretty simplistic though.  It&#x27;s less by country, more by ASN.  And it&#x27;s also a case of automation killing you.  What happens when the DDoS attack takes out a single PoP worth of DNS servers?  Usually you have some automated tooling that will take down that PoP entirely, and withdraw the announcement.  You want this behaviour in almost all cases.  However, now that attack traffic just got sent to the next-closest server (in this example EU - taking down the whole worldwide cluster).<p>So it&#x27;s not as simple as having &quot;100gbps worth of inbound DNS capacity&quot; - you need to spread it out properly, and of course deal with attacks like you would otherwise.<p>The other problem is it&#x27;s UDP - so spoofed packets and the like are a much bigger problem.",1419302698

You will still need it in 2-3 sites, probably located in US west / US east / EU west because of the cost of datacenter space and the availability of cheap connectivity.<p>Serving 100Gbit/s requires 20 10G circuits in each site (~$15-30k/mo), 80 servers (2-3 racks, so $5-10k/mo), and a not-so-cheap router.<p>So your monthly opex is $20-40k per site, $60-120k worldwide. Your capex is $450k per site, $1.35mm worldwide.<p>It&#x27;s not an insane amount of money, but it is kind of a lot to spend on DNS. It&#x27;s particularly tough to justify at a lot of companies that you need this kind of buildout, when normally you can operate on 1/20th that amount of hardware.",1419301934

For instance, you don&#x27;t imagine that renting one of those steam-carpet cleaners from the grocery store once every year or two is more expensive than owning one, right?<p>(Renting is more expensive than purely your share of the use -- that is, if the steam cleaner gets rented by 100 people in a year, you expect to pay more than 1% of the yearly total cost of ownership of the cleaner).<p>So the concept is that say you effectively use maybe 1/5th to 1/3rd of a car&#x27;s capacity in a ride-for-hire situation, and so you pay say 25%-40% of the total cost of ownership, allowing a reasonable profit margin for the owner.

To that end, I&#x27;m a fan of a technique called &quot;capability cases&quot;, and actually wrote a series of blog posts on that topic a while back.  I&#x27;ll refer you there for more on that topic:<p><a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-capability-cases-are-must-when.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-capability-cases-are...</a><p><a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/02/so-what-is-capability-case-anyway.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/02/so-what-is-capability-ca...</a><p><a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/05/capability-cases-part-three-sample.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/05/capability-cases-part-th...</a><p>The other positive thing about the Capability Cases methodology is that it helps IT people learn to &quot;speak the language&quot; of LOB executives (and, to some extent, vice versa, if everybody buys in), and helps bridge that gap between &quot;the business side of things&quot; and &quot;the IT side of things&quot;.<p>Anyway, if you get through all that and decide that some sort of BPM system is for you, there are a handful of high quality, popular, Open Source BPM engines out there that you could consider.  If nothing else, they could enable you to get to a good POC quickly and without spending a bazillion dollars.  One popular option is Activiti:<p><a href=""http://www.activiti.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.activiti.org</a><p>It uses the industry standing BPMN2 notation.  Stay away from anything that mentions BPEL, and stay away from Oracle products.  Especially Oracle products that involve BPEL.<p>Depending on how complex your needs are, you might not actually need a dedicated BPM / workflow engine. In that case, you could certainly code up automation code in any general purpose language of choice.  But be careful of going down the path where you wind up rebuilding the wheel.<p>I&#x27;d also advocate taking a careful look at the idea of &quot;Social BPM&quot;, which focuses on making BPM systems more flexible and less rigid, and introducing aspects involving social connections between humans.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be overly self-promotional here, but I will refer you again to a couple of posts I have previously written on this subject, which may be of use to you:<p><a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/05/social-events-bpm-oh-my-but-what-about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2013/05/social-events-bpm-oh-my-...</a><p><a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2014/02/on-solving-social-aspect-of-bpm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2014/02/on-solving-social-aspect...</a><p>Like I said, this is a big topic.

If it&#x27;s JSON over HTTP (as you&#x27;ve said above), why would they need to reinvent HTTP to achieve any of the stuff they&#x27;re trying to achieve? They already have all of HTTP to choose from, no need to reinvent it. And, you&#x27;ve made a lot of claims based on some kind of slippery slope argument (which is a fallacy).<p>I think it would be educational for everyone talking on this subject to spend some time learning a bit about the existing protocols in the space. SMTP is messy, and shows its age in a <i>lot</i> of regards (character encoding complexity, transfer of large data, authentication of sending servers, etc.). IMAP is somewhat less messy and slightly more modern, but still quite old.<p>Neither protocol is well-tuned for modern email usage. I don&#x27;t know that JMAP will solve it, but given how much effort is going into web tools, both on the server and client side, and how many more people have experience developing with HTTP, I don&#x27;t see any reason to not leverage that for email, too.",1419300240

Multiple vendors on /r/bitcoin claiming little to no volume either compared to last year.<p>>I am confident you are able to find some anecdotes on /r/bitcoin from a few mom-and-pop shops disappointed by their bitcoin sales this year. But anecdotes are not data. Data is the &quot;+82%&quot; number I reported above.<p>Right so reports from multiple vendors about lackluster sales are anecdotes.  A vanity number like 82% increase with no indication of the size of the transactions, etc is data.  How about the fact that bitpay has been claiming the 1m a day in transactions now for over half a year?  How about that for no growth?<p>>Their sales are not declining anymore. They have reached a steady state of $7000-8000 a day for the last 3 months<p>That is a decline<p>Here are the figures from their releases so far<p>Jan 10 - 130K  
Jan 11-29 - $26K/day average
Next 36 days to March 4th they do $400K - $11K/day average
Next 83 days to May 27th they do $600K - $7200/day average<p>Now they are claiming $7000 a day.  Given that the $7200 * the number of days left in the year = $3m I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll see that $3m number change again when they actually release their financials.<p>>That&#x27;s why cash works. You go to a restaurant and pay cash because you don&#x27;t care about giving up the ability to contest the charge: you trust the restaurant<p>Cash works like this because you are physically present with the merchant when you use it so you can validate immediately if you are getting ripped off or not.<p>>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have to satisfy 100% of use cases to be successful.<p>Right but it has to satisfy enough common ones to convince users to make the additional effort to acquire it.  It&#x27;s not doing that.<p>>I chuckled at this. Obviously you are unfamiliar with how it&#x27;s done. The standard way of doing a &quot;charge back&quot; in Bitcoin is to ask the customer to provide a refund address. Easy peasy :)<p>Yes that explains why there are no scams in bitcoin at all.  And there were no complaints about Tigerdirect fulfillment related to bitcoin orders.<p>>You completely ignored what I said: despite not losing money, it can be a tremendous annoyance and hassle to cancel and replace a CC, with the incident affecting your credit score, etc. These are real problems, real annoyances, NOT solved by credit cards. Bitcoin fixes that.<p>But it&#x27;s not a tremendous hassle.  You call the bank tell them the card was stolen(or they detect it) list any transactions you didn&#x27;t make and the money is refunded and a new card is posted.  There are a handful of cases where it is more difficult than that.  Do you have examples of it affecting credit scores?<p>>Second time you completely ignored what I said: yes security is hard, but hardware wallets are improving security. You can&#x27;t deny this.<p>Walk me through the steps to buying and putting bitcoin on your hardware wallet that wouldn&#x27;t be compromised by the user having a virus on their computer that targeted bitcoin.<p>>They do work (I have used one). Please enlighten us<p>Which one have you used and I&#x27;ll tell you how to abuse it.<p>>Wrong. As I explained, my example (sendbitcoin.mx) does not need physical presence, as they rely on an existing bank ATM network, even if you don&#x27;t have a bank account.<p>That is a physical presence.  The fact that they are using someone elses physical presence doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t need one.  It means they are using someone elses locations to subsidize their own.  Companies tend to not like that which is why I would put money on sendbitcoin.mx being shut down within the next 6 months.<p>>Banks don&#x27;t do it for the same reason large companies often fail to innovate compared to small agile startups: inertia, redtape, etc.<p>Actually there were a lot of banks doing the US->MX remittance up until a few years ago when regulations and compliance got to be way too expensive for it to be profitable.",1419300119

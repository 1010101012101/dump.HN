It seems like it would be more meaningful to examine how various percentiles of &quot;moves per game&quot; change over time rather than plotting a confidence interval around the mean.<p>In particular, the mean moves-per-game that he displayed is (I assume) the actual mean of his data set. It&#x27;s not an estimate of the mean of some larger population of games, if I&#x27;m understanding the article correctly. So what does it mean to display a confidence interval for a parameter that&#x27;s known rather than been estimated?<p>It seems more interesting to treat the data set as the population and analyze how it changes over time. For example, I&#x27;d be interested to see a graph of 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile of match length. I notice that the confidence interval is shrinking around his mean -- is that really reflecting that percentiles are converging on the mean because of changes in play style? Or have I misunderstood and the data set is being treated as a random sample of some larger population of chess games? (In that case, since there are more games in his data set in later years, it is unsurprising for the confidence interval to shrink. Whereas if the percentiles of match length are converging on the mean, then I think that&#x27;s pretty interesting.)",1400972260

Given the tendency toward exponential progress in all things we do, I tend to think that within 10,000 years, we&#x27;ll either be off the planet or extinct. (That&#x27;s not to say that we&#x27;re destined to make the Earth uninhabitable, although that could happen. I just think we&#x27;re &quot;up or out&quot; as a species.

This could be used as a negotiating tactic if they are averse to the idea of vesting in general.<p>* What&#x27;s best for everyone is what&#x27;s best for the company.

The correct term for an individual game is a &quot;game&quot;.<p>&quot;Plays per person&quot; is known as simply &quot;moves&quot;. If each player has made 37 moves, that&#x27;s 74 half-moves, or 74 ply (in the context of lookahead in the game tree by a computer).<p>Most analysts, when studying performance, assign scores of 1 and 0 to White and Black when White wins, 0 and 1 when Black wins, and 1/2 point to each when there&#x27;s a draw. It is unusual to not count draws when analyzing performance. Doing so would decrease White&#x27;s apparent advantage. For example, I just checked all the 2013 games from Chessbase&#x27;s Megabase and White scored 53.4% with draws counted as a half point for each side.<p>By the way, one of the reasons that draws have decreased in the last 30 years is probably the advent of faster time controls.

Mutable local variables are harmless so long as they don&#x27;t escape (as in a closure). If the inputs and outputs are immutable then it&#x27;s still a pure function.

It is something that made me wonder too.<p>So many developments are said to have emerged from 9/11, but barely any actually have. ECHELON was there, the east-west and the middle-least conflicts were there. The NSA and it&#x27;s mission to surveil the whole world was there. Secret pacts in these directions have emerged from World War 2, maybe even earlier.<p>If you look back into history, thirty years things don&#x27;t seem all too different.

Scheme48 heap-allocates stack frames, and then relies on garbage collection to reclaim space from tail-calls, so this happens automatically. And MIT Scheme uses a ring-buffer to keep around the last 10-or-so frames. (Actually it is even nicer than that: it uses ringbuffer-of-ringbuffers to keep 10-or-so frames from each of the last 10-or-so non-tail recursive calls.

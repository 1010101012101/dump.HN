4641931,comment,4641588,4641588,20,0,wissler,,,"<i>Btw, it's not just microkernels. Any time you have ""one overriding idea"", and push your idea as a superior ideology, you're going to be wrong. Microkernels had one such ideology, there have been others. It's all BS. The fact is, reality is complicated, and not amenable to the ""one large idea"" model of problem solving. The only way that problems get solved in real life is with a lot of hard work on getting the details right. Not by some over-arching ideology that somehow magically makes things work.</i><p>Yes, well, Torvalds is here disputing one of the main drivers of science, the motive that brought us Newtonian physics, quantum mechanics, you know, the very things he depends on via his use of microprocessor technology.<p>If your ""one overriding idea"" is wrong, then certainly that'll get you into trouble, but as history demonstrates, they aren't always wrong. They are always hard to come up with, and often when you come up with them you face an uphill battle with people who want to maintain the status quo and who can't conceive of ""one big idea."" But eventually those ideas are the ones that cause tectonic shifts in human progress.<p>His reference to Edison is apt. It wasn't Edison who brought us the AC motor that literally revolutionized power distribution and the whole industrialized world. It was a man who thought big, who had ""one overriding idea"": Tesla.",1349978361

4641925,comment,4639271,4639661,2,0,mcantor,,,"I lucked out with this project; it began as a Kickstarter which got incredibly overfunded:<p><a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-cheat-sheet-poster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxcantor/beautiful-vim-...</a><p>It hit the front page of ""Featured Technology"" projects and lived there for almost the entire funding run.<p>I used UPrinting for the printing, who I'm quite happy with. It cost less than a thousand dollars to do the initial run of 500 posters.<p>Initially, my approach to shipping was to buy 500 poster tubes from Uline (no relation to UPrinting) and ship them myself. This was an unmitigated disaster; a cataclysm; a miserable shit-show of Brobdingnagian proportions. There is simply not sufficient support for the ""hobbyist shipper""; USPS doesn't know what to do with you, UPS and Fedex charge too much (especially for international shipping), and the label-printing tools are across-the-board some of the worst software I've ever worked with. After months of Kafkaesque hijinks with USPS, I gave up and shipped my inventory to Fulfillrite, a third-party fulfillment provider. Thank God for those guys.<p>I haven't run the numbers to determine my exact profit & loss, but I make more than just beer money. I don't know if I'll ever sell enough to come even close to what the Kickstarter originally made, but the web store has been bringing in around $750/mo in revenue, which translates to something in the range of $350 - $500 of profit.<p>I tend to make money to the extent that more eyeballs hit the site. Last month, someone mentioned the poster in passing in the <i>comment</i> of a blog I'd never heard of, and I made $300 in six hours. I have no idea how to advertise, though, so that kind of thing is usually just lucky happenstance for me.<p>I'll probably do another couple of poster projects (bash, emacs, etc.); if they are even nearly as successful as this one, I might eventually be able to live exclusively off the profits! An exciting prospect, but one that is quite far off.<p>Feel free to drop me a line if you have any other questions. I really ought to condense this stuff into a blog post some time.",1349978252

All paid-subscriptions magazines still appear as free apps on iOS, but they either offer a free sample or a free trial.<p>In this case, it's a free trial, which makes sense when it's the first issue! But don't be surprised if The Magazine switches to a free sample. That's especially worth noting if you're expecting to optimize for a free trial.<p>My point is that Marco doesn't have any expertise selling advertising, as many would like him to do, and does have a lot of experience selling through the App Store.

This particular way of expressing declarative structure may be specific to Clojure, but the basic ideas should be useful in any (especially dynamic) language with first-class functions.<p>The first idea is to take a complex system and express the set of components and their relationships declaratively, rather than procedurally.  This is an old idea, and makes it possible to reason about the system, mock out components for testing, map over the components for monitoring, and more.<p>The second idea is simplicity. By making this declarative language as simple as possible, it becomes trivially easy to do all the things I just mentioned using the existing tools in the language, without needing to write complex library functions to support each use case.<p>For another example of a declarative system for composition  you could look at 'react' in JS, which can be used in similar ways to Graph (and also supports things like async composition): <a href=""https://github.com/jeffbski/react"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jeffbski/react</a>",1349977504

The list of things with entirely rectangular buttons includes Windows prior to XP, most other older non-Mac window managers and OSes, and a vast number of real-world products like stereos and TVs. The very top thing on that link is an update basically saying it's an unresolved question: ""My rounded rectangles cognitive argument is getting a good thrashing   which is a good thing. I'm as keen as anyone to find out if the theory holds water, and if you can direct me to better research, I'd love to read it. Please share!"" I don't buy it, personally. Maybe the reason signs in public places have rounded corners, like the famous No Parking sign Jobs showed, is just to avoid having sharp corners for safety? Then there's stuff like the utterly-minimal rounding of Lion/Mountain Lion buttons: they'd fall pretty high on that cognitive cost scale he posits, especially compared to the Aqua ones they replaced.<p>The lack of hinting that one element is clickable/tappable while another is a bigger issue, though, than just rounded edges. As far as web use of this style goes, I think the arrows-in-circles (or something similar) used on the main button on this page, and on the Windows Azure site mentioned elsewhere in the comments here will be key.<p>WP7 is pretty good about having ""buttons"" be styled fairly distinctively from other elements (they're circular in the menu bar at the bottom of an app, and in other places like the ""More Details"" button when editing a calendar appointment they get a thick distinctive border.<p>When your style is minimal you need to be very careful and consistent with the meaning of what visual cues you do have,  so how stuff like that will translate to the webespecially if someone just wants to make a site look ""Metro"" but isn't so familiar with the conventions)is an open question.",1349977345

Clearly its an intelligence asset in times of war, there was a big dust up that insurgents were getting imagery of American bases in Saudia Arabia from Google Earth, that seems pretty straight forward. But what about Area 51? What about Taiwan's radar site that monitors the space between the island and the mainland for supersonic cruise missiles that China is alleged to possess? All sorts of interesting questions.<p>The economics in this case work against privacy, in so much that many people are willing to pay to see something that one person doesn't want seen. Imagine that Google had a system where they could charge for viewing satellite tiles at the 1M resolution. And user's could 'bid' for access like advertisers bid for space on the search results. Now the people who are in the tile can bid for 'non access.' If 1000 people bid $1 to see Area 51 in the Nevada desert the Air Force has to bid $1001 to not show it? That wouldn't work (although it would make Google a ton of money :-)<p>I'm not sure what the answer is, although I know that it only gets worse with UAV's carrying 16MP digital cameras on them.",1349977284

If you have a first-gen i5, or even a Core 2 Duo, your CPU is plenty fast to complete 99% of computer tasks out there without feeling any sluggishness. 10 years ago, when people would come to me for advice on purchasing a laptop/desktop, I would tell them to buy the best processor they can afford and then upgrade the rest of the components while they use it. Nowadays, most decent laptops ship with an i5 at minimum, some people ask me if they should upgrade to the i7.

Combined with catastrophic health coverage, this makes it possible to weather even a fairly bad storm.<p>Beware of believing the party line on medical bills and bankruptcy, by the way. As far as I can tell, surveys showing that medical bills ""contribute"" to a large fraction of bankruptcies fail to establish causation. What they do show is that people who declare bankruptcy also often have significant medical bills. But of course many people do. I bet lots of people who declare bankruptcy also have car payments, maintenance, and repair bills, but it would be misleading to conclude that car costs are one of the biggest contributors to bankruptcy.

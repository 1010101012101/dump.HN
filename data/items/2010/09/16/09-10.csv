It is also, weak for the following reasons:<p>1. No innovation happens (which is why Apple came up with the smartphone touch UI and Google just copies it)<p>2. People don't like change, so will favour things close to what they had before<p>You have fallen straight into the same odd thinking dominating Google, that UI is incremental, testable and easily measurable.<p>You want precise and measurable. That's not design. Jonathan Ives is worth his weight in gold for his design skills as much as Linus Torvalds is worth his weight in gold as a programmer. And we as engineers have to accept that.<p>Google will never come up with a great design with the way it approaches the problem. While I love their products, none of them have ever blown me away because of their elegance or coherence. They only know how to do simplicity and are beginning to forget how to do that too.",1284630662

Up to a certain point of realism people react favorably but then there is a point when people no longer like what they are seeing. So if you just interpolate the test results with shaving off seconds it sounds really good on paper from an engineering standpoint but in practice it is something else. Shaving off seconds after you press enter I think is a good thing but shaving off seconds while you are typing is a completely different thing. The instant thing doesn't make any sense to me and all it does is just add visual clutter. Plus I'm not entirely convinced google added instant for the benefit of the consumer. What were they trying to do, save an extra keystroke? All instant does is make ads pop up sooner and I think that was the real motivation behind implementing it.",1284630374

1697327,comment,1694231,1696204,0,0,matthiasl,,,"Companies with telecom products are generally conservative about switching Erlang versions. Most of Corelatus' production systems run R11B-5. Quite a few still run R9C-2. There's no compelling reason to upgrade them, there are thousands of those systems in dozens of countries and most run billing systems. They typically run for years at a time and only get upgraded in conjunction with a larger system upgrade.<p>It's not like you sit there typical 'apt-get update' a couple of times a day to see if there's anything new you might want...<p>On the other hand, people who are new to the language generally like to use the very latest because it contains the most features. E.g. later versions have increasingly good SMP support, which may be important if you're working on something which has to scale across many cores, but it's completely irrelevant to me because our hardware only runs Erlang on one core.<p>My suggestion for a starting point: if you're just developing, follow the R14 sequence, i.e. every time a new one gets release, download it, compile and install from source. If you're ready to deploy now, use R13B04 and let others find the bugs in R14.<p>Potential biases: I work at Corelatus. I've worked for Ericsson. I maintain the Erlang FAQ.",1284629696

Consumers don't want to have to know all kinds of useless details just to be able to use their device.  Personally I hate installing software on windows.  There is a vast amount of it, but there is no one there making sure it's not going to damage my system (for the most part, of course you can restrict yourself to only software that has the MS seal).  On OSX this is slightly better, but I still hate it when that little box opens up asking me to grant access.<p>On iOS however, I install without much thought.  I know that anything I download there has been vetted by someone with a strong interest in making sure their platform doesn't look bad (among some other interests that are less to my benefit).  For me the trade off of not ever having to think about this stuff is worth missing out on things like Google Voice.<p>I don't think the reason Android has been doing well in the US has anything what so ever to do with silly ""open"" dogma, but rather that it's cheaper and isn't tied to AT&T.",1284628907

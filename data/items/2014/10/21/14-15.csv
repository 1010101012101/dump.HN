The device must receive the challenge. &quot;Typing out&quot; keys isn&#x27;t sufficient unless that typing can go the other way. And in the OS, there has to be support for Chrome to send data to such a device. Normal keyboard input is not sufficient for this. This is what I&#x27;m looking for clarity on.",1413903595

8487656,comment,8486916,8487321,0,0,jmclean,,,"As a designer who also writes code, this attitude really frustrates me. There are a lot of reasons that flat UI makes more sense for software, especially for responsive web.<p>Flat UI means less code and easier maintainability. It holds up better across a wide range of sizes. It makes it easier to have a style guide in code and create reusable modules.\nThis allows the design team to focus on the bigger-picture user experience instead of perfecting button gradients.<p>High information density is great in many applications, especially interfaces supporting complex tasks for expert users. However, it takes a <i>lot</i> of work to design a great high-density interface. I feel like most of the high density interfaces I see are more of a case of the design or product teams not being able to make hard decisions about what&#x27;s really important.<p>While some flat UIs certainly go too far in the other direction, I firmly believe that minimalism encourages good design by forcing a conversation about what information to prioritize. Especially for the mainstream consumer web, this is almost always better for everyone.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t appreciate this kind of attack on my profession. Good design is far closer to engineering than to taste. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hoodwinking people into hiring me.",1413903453

I&#x27;ve hacked something together for my personal usage with my OpenGPG smartcard for use on my Windows desktop and developer-mode chromebook. In the end I had to work with &quot;chrome native messaging&quot; which basically calls native binaries on the host OS and is a nightmare to set up.<p>This doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re planning to start supporting existing smartcards, but hopefully it&#x27;s a first step?<p>My idea was to create a login page that requires the user to sign a secret with their private key which can be completed manually, but also automatically with the click of a button if the extension is installed. The key could live securely on a smartcard or in the user&#x27;s gpg keyring, it doesn&#x27;t matter as that part is deferred to gpg.<p>In case anyone happens to be interested, my un-documented prototype sits at <a href=""https://github.com/r04r/GPGThing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/r04r/GPGThing</a>.

And if you&#x27;re not hyper security conscious, you&#x27;re not going to bother with a physical key.<p>The reason that &quot;upper end of secure machines&quot; have disabled USB ports is because they are organization-owned machines that are issued to untrusted employees (often in organizations where <i>all</i> employees are untrusted in the relevant sense). But in the case of first-party machines (e.g., personally owned machines) where the user is similarly security-conscious, that factor doesn&#x27;t exist. So, really, all you need to be is a security-conscious individual that uses your own computer for things where you have security concerns. (Or, as an organization, be one where the threat profile you concerned about addressing is more external than internal.)",1413902884

Posture<p>The main cause of RSI is bad posture at the desk. Both the way you type and use the mouse, but importantly also the way you sit.<p>There&#x27;s little point treating the symptoms if you don&#x27;t treat the cause. Looking around my workplace, I see pretty much no-one in the correct posture.<p>- The back of your chair should be in contact with your back, i.e. actually touching it at all times.<p>- You should be <i>right</i> under the desk. If your chair has arm rests that stop you from getting under the desk, get a new chair.<p>- Top of screen at eye-level (most people have this spot on).<p>- Keyboard a little back from the edge of the desk.<p>- Elbows at approximately 90 degrees<p>- your wrists should not be at an awkward angle as they approach the keyboard.<p>2. Ergonomic devices<p>Get a good sized keyboard. Don&#x27;t use awkward keyboard shortcuts, e.g. alt-tabbing on a Mac running virtual box requires your left thumb to reach underneath the other fingers. This is bad. Re-map common shortcuts or use two hands.<p>Get a mouse that has a natural (hand-shake/vertical) grip. e.g.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical-1600DPI/dp/B00BIFNTMC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wireless-Vertical-Ergonomic-Optical-...</a><p>This reduces the stress on your wrist. Made a huge difference to me. Check out the reviews.<p>3. Exercise<p>My physio recommended swimming, as physios so often do! It will strengthen your back and core, to help you sit up straight.<p>However, she also recommended walking. Walk at lunch and in the evening, to get away from the sitting posture.<p>This has pretty much cured my RSI. Take it or leave it! :-)",1413902288

Yet we live in a time where we don&#x27;t need a PhD program to receive education from the likes of Ng, LeCun and Langford. We live in a time where curiosity and dedication can net you valuable results. Where CUDA-hackers can beat university teams. The entire field of big data visualization requires innate aptitude and creativity, not so much an expensive PhD program. I suspect Paul Graham, when solving his spam problem with ML, benefited more from his philosophy education than his computer science education.<p>Of course, having a PhD. still shows dedication and talent. But it is no guarantee for practical ML skills, it can even hamper research and results, when too much power is given to theory and reputation is at stake.<p>In my experience Machine Learning was locked up in academics, and even in academics it was subdivided. The idea that &quot;you need to be an ML expert, before you can run an algo&quot; is detrimental to the field, not helping so much in adopting a wider industry use of ML. Those ML experts set the academic benchmarks that amateurs were able to beat by trying out Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.<p>I predict that ML will become part of the IT-stack, as much as databases have. Nowadays, you do not need to be a certified DBA to set up a database. It is helpful and in some cases heavily advisable, but databases now see a much wider adoption by laypeople. This is starting to happen in ML. I think more hobbyists are right now toying with convolutional neural networks, than there are serious researchers in this area. These hobbyists can surely find and contribute valuable practical insights.<p>Tuning parameters is basically a gridsearch. You can bruteforce this. In goes some ranges of parameters, out come the best params found. Fairly easy to explain to a programmer.<p>Adapting existing algorithms is ML researcher territory. That is a few miles above the business people extracting valuable/actionable insight from (big or small or tedious) data. Also there is a wide range of big data engineers making it physically possible to have the &quot;necessary&quot; PhD&#x27;s extract value from Big Data.",1413902125

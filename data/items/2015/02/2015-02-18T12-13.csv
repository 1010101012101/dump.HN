Happens ALL the time.

Or the rationalization thing, where lets face it, he was fired because he is gay and the boss is a republican, if the boss is smart enough not to leak that topic, but sufficiently dumb enough, in a long personal conversation out will come ridiculous rationalizations about the guys LoC or bug report / fix rates or attendance as a distractor for the boss to avoid talking about homophobia, unfortunately the rationalized metrics can actually be measured and open the company to wrongful termination lawsuits.  &quot;Your honor he said the only reason was my attendance wasn&#x27;t very good, but my documents prove it was the best in the office, note the only day I was gone was a scheduled vacation day for the pride parade and he&#x27;s out of the office continually attending fund raisers for anti-gay marriage republican candidates&quot; etc etc.  Usually that kind of stuff is settled expensively out of court with non-disparagement clauses so future employees can&#x27;t avoid predatory bosses, which is another problem.<p>You can pretty much assume if &quot;they&quot; won&#x27;t tell you why you&#x27;re fired, and you can&#x27;t obviously figure it out, then it was some illegal thing like above and they&#x27;re smart enough not to provide lawsuit fodder on a platter.<p>Ya gotta realize that half of management is by definition below median, and that half of the population can create very expensive lawsuits.",1424263539

The hash only needs to be big enough that brute-forcing becomes infeasible. Depending on the type of server-level flood control you&#x27;re using, you can exactly determine the amount of bits required.<p>Or if you choose not to, a conservative estimate of 48 bits (8 characters in base64) characters should be more than enough. Remember that offline brute-forcing is not possible here, and at a rate of, say, 1M tries per second you&#x27;ll be brute-forcing yourself silly for somewhere in the order of 2 years.<p>If you can make tighter estimates about flood control, these are rough (and still conservative x4) estimates: at a limit of 15k tries per second you can do with 7 bytes (times 6 bits). At a limit of 200 tries per second, just 6 bytes of base64 code (without proper flood control a large botnet could make this last one somewhat feasible, maybe).<p>... unless you mean to imply that the string &quot;reset?user=John&expiry=987654321&quot; is the ugly, unwieldy part :)<p>> For example the base64 encoding I was using for the authentication token included &#x27;.&#x27; as a one of the characters. Well, turns out that the linkification code in gmail will ignore a &#x27;.&#x27; at the end of the link (which is kind of sensible). So 1/64 of my validation links ended up being invalid.<p>Using the wrong encoding for your URLs has nothing to do with this technique. In fact, I don&#x27;t think the article even suggested a particular type of encoding.<p>Did you not know what characters your base64 routine would output, or something? There&#x27;s more than just the period that you don&#x27;t want to end a URL with because of ambiguity with the ways people might want to use URLs in a sentence: Closing parens, comma, exclamation, asterisk, etc. Regardless of what one particular webmail provider will linkify or not, it&#x27;s just common sense, if you think about it.<p>Closing parens are always a big problem with many Wikipedia links, it&#x27;s not like this is some obscure &quot;gotcha&quot;.<p>That is what the %XX URL-encoding was made for.<p>Or why not just use what YouTube does, they seem to have it figured out pretty well: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and -",1424263464

As a kindergartner, I was playing a toy organ with play-by-number song books, and later in grade school I played clarinet. Big mistake: quitting in eight grade. As a side note, whenever I looked up words in the dictionary, I always paid attention to the etymology as well as the definition.<p>The only subject that I aced in college was Spanish, and the teacher was very good (and a native speaker), but not easy. We started Spanish 101 with 30 students, and ended Spanish 104 with just seven.<p>Now, 30+ years later, it&#x27;s a bit rusty, but I can still read it pretty well, and can sort-of understand written Portuguese as well. I can drive down Collins St. in Joliet and easily read the signs on the businesses.<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more! One Sunday, in 1993, I walked down to a neighborhood church that I had never visited before, and sat down, as it turned out, behind the music director. She heard me singing the hymns, and asked me immediately after the service if I&#x27;d be interested in joining the choir. Then, the next week, the handbell choir was playing, and I was hooked -- I ended up joining both.<p>More recently, I joined a community chorus that sings a wide range of pieces, and a great many of the old masterworks are not in English. I&#x27;ve found that I could pretty readily pick up pronunciation for a variety of languages, and even though I&#x27;ve never taken German lessons, I can almost figure out what&#x27;s being sung in Bach or Mozart works -- and when I read an English translation, the relationships between English and German almost jump off the page for me. I still wouldn&#x27;t be able to put together a coherent sentence in German, though.<p>If I had the time and money, I&#x27;d consider taking German, and maybe even Russian (I taught myself the Cyrillic alphabet at one point, so the alphabet would be the least of my problems).",1424263060

9068043,comment,9067355,9067921,0,0,drapper,,,"I think most common way of thinking about Marx&#x27; work today is that he was often right in describing what&#x27;s wrong with the capitalism, but he was mostly wrong at the solutions.<p>Marx&#x27; apologists point out, not without a reason, that one of the problems with the attempts of bringing his theories to life is that those attempts were done in countries not well suited to do it. Marxism, according to Marx, was supposed to be another step in the evolution of capitalism, yet it was tried in countries that didn&#x27;t yet have any capitalism or had it in some very immature form, e.g. in post-tzar, soviet Russia.<p>On the other hand he was claiming that capitalism is unmaintainable and will fall by itself and that didn&#x27;t happen either.",1424260961

That alone would drop off most of the complexity. (Being perfectly honest, even though it&#x27;s part of the standard, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to parse them now, anyway. I don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;ve never had anyone complain to me about the site not working. Nothing mainstream sends them for the important fields.)<p>Add a Server-Push header (filename+ETag), and we could eliminate most extraneous 304 Not Modified requests. Have browsers actually acknowledge Connection: keep-alive instead of opening tons of parallel requests. And leave this as the &quot;hobbyist level, can&#x27;t afford wildcard SSL certs&quot; option, and I think it&#x27;d be quite beneficial.<p>If browsers want to warn that it&#x27;s not encrypted, fine. So long as they don&#x27;t go into ridiculous hysteria levels like they do now with self-signed certs.<p>One immediate potential downside is Apache. It completely ignores the protocol request. If you ask for &quot;GET / HTTP/1.2&quot;, or even &quot;GET / HackerNewsTP/3.141e&quot;, it will happily reply with &quot;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&quot;<p>As a result, the negotiation would be trickier than with HTTP/2.<p>But like you said, it could be done in a way that it&#x27;s 100% backward-compatible with existing 1.1 software, so long as their responses are also in a compatible, simplified format (and most already are.)",1424260919

The first couple of times, I&#x27;m sure, he got great results. And he actually pulled the trigger and fired some people.<p>But this went on for <i>months</i>. Once you start threatening to fire people? You&#x27;ve got nowhere to escalate past that. You&#x27;re done. People just throw away any sense of civility and hang in as long as they think they can get a check out of you. Talk about ways to destroy your company morale.<p>You should always fire quickly, gently, privately, and with kindness. You should never fire publicly and harshly. And you should never drag out firing somebody because you&#x27;re too chicken to get the job done. You want to play the role of hard-as-nails company leader? Fine. People remember that stuff.

We're talking billion and trillion of calculations made everyday by humans.<p>When you talk about government solutions, inevitabley, you talk about command economy insitutions that have to determine calculations that affect every single area of the economy. Even if it can gather the informations it needed to do the calculation, it must understand all the consequences that will happen when they decide whether to grant a patent.<p>How long the copyright term should last? What is the unintended consequences? What kind of artistic work will emerge? What resource will need to be allocated to this sector of the economy? Will it really satisfy the consumers? Is there enough supply for the demand in the right time?<p>This is not a mere ""complex problem"", my friend. It is an espitemology problem.<p>When I said the solution is to remove copyright, I don't say this as a mere naive solution.<p>It is reached by my conclusion that the regulatory agencies cannot calculate, therefore it cannot calculate how long copyright should exists or it should at all. What they relies on is called statistics but it is inferior to the profit and loss check and balance that exists in the market. Without those profit and loss, they do not know if a particular solution or implementation is profitable to society at all. They are not accountable to the market at large because it is largely immaterial to their nature as a political machinery.<p>There's more to what I have to said(including emperical evidence as well my reasoning behind this), but I think it will turn into some half-ass super long eassy if I keep on talking.",1241740115

Specifically, they tend to have a very poor grasp of both dynamically typed languages and functional programming.  While they might ""know"" tools like Python, they don't think in these languages well and tend to write very clumsy code.<p>For myself, once I got to a point where I could ""think well"" using syntax at both a high level of abstraction and write solid C code at the system call level I found that the space of ""appropriate"" problems for C++ had shrunk to almost nothing.  By itself, if it's the only language you're ever going to learn, C++ is not a bad choice.

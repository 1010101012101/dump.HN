For example, implementations may choose to limit the range to facilitate efficient compilation to Javascript. These limitations should be relaxed as soon as technologically feasible.<p>So in principle Dart has bignums and doubles, but does not specify anything about how &quot;big&quot; the bignums are supposed to be, so a conformant implementation can simply not implement bignums (i.e. they are the size of the integers that fit in doubles).<p>This technically makes dart2js conformant, even though it in practice has different numeric types than the VM.

The site&#x27;s guidelines and standards required a lot of upkeep by Kyle (Forrst&#x27;s founder), but in turn enabled the growth of a community of learners and teachers. As the individuals learned and grew, so did the community.<p>Unfortunately, keeping those incentives aligned proved to be too difficult to sustain. After Kyle left, Forrst slowly evolved into a platform for experienced designers to simply promote their work. The more inexperienced members stopped receiving feedback because nobody saw their posts, and in turn people stopped even posting unless they had an ulterior motive (e.g. go view my portfolio, or download this freebie and promote my work).<p>Zurb correctly recognized that the &quot;Dribblification&quot; of Forrst led to its downfall, but Tavern essentially ignores the original problem. The problem wasn&#x27;t that we needed help answering the big questions (like &quot;are designers too isolated from the consequences of their work&quot;), but that we all wanted help with the small, day-to-day questions (like &quot;how do I improve the layout on this page&quot; or &quot;what color should this be&quot;). The focus wasn&#x27;t on the <i>industry</i> growth, but on the <i>personal</i> growth.<p>Of course, the bigger industry questions and trends naturally grew from the sum of the community&#x27;s posts and responses. Meta-questions were fun when they came up, but they were only popular because there was an existing community there to read them. They certainly weren&#x27;t the focus of the site, and I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;ll be enough to sustain this new version.",1404244261

7973071,comment,7945084,7946590,1,0,tkps,,,"Correction to OP: In Polymer, ajax CAN be an element.  Or not.  You can build whatever elements you want in Polymer (even non-visual utility elements like xhr and localStorage), but it&#x27;s YOUR job (the developer) to choose the elements that fit in with the goals and architecture of your project.<p>Equating the fact that Polymer PROVIDES a declarative ajax element with the inevitability that any project you build will be fraught with bad code factoring and memory bloat because you MUST use it is like saying that because jQuery UI provides a Tab View, all of your jQuery UI&#x27;s will be horrible because you must build them only out of Tab Views.  Polymer just provides the sugar for minting your own custom elements, as well as a solid reference set of pre-built elements (core-<i>, paper-</i>); which ones you choose to use is up to you.<p>Most of this discussion largely misses the point and elegance of what Web Components generally and Polymer specifically are gunning for: The ability to create, reuse, and share well-factored, arbitrary pieces of web functionality (which may or may not include presentation) that have a well-defined imperative API (instance properties, methods) as well as a familiar, serializable declarative syntax (HTML) that can be manipulated imperatively after the fact (DOM), that will (one day, fingers crossed) be consumed natively by all browsers, without today&#x27;s existing framework-based silos (React components, Angular directives, etc.).  When it makes sense in your application (i.e., when you determine you get more use out of factoring it as a reusable element), then promote that functionality to an element; otherwise, you&#x27;re free to embed that functionality (including ajax requests) as imperative JavaScript inside the component using the techniques you use today.<p>As for why you <i>might</i> be interested in a declarative <ajax> element: Polymer also provides declarative property binding and templating, which makes this possible (and absurdly simple, and very cool IMO):<p><pre><code>    <select value=&quot;{{department}}&quot;>\n      <option value=&quot;eng&quot; selected>Engineering</option>\n      <option value=&quot;sales&quot;>Sales</option>\n      <option value=&quot;hr&quot;>Human Resources</option>\n    </select>\n\n    <core-ajax url=&quot;/{{department}}.json&quot; handleAs=&quot;json&quot; response=&quot;{{employees}}&quot; auto></core-ajax>\n\n    <template repeat=&quot;{{employee in employees}}&quot;>\n      <div>{{employee.name}}</div>\n      <img src=&quot;{{employee.avatar}}&quot;>\n    </template>\n</code></pre>\nNote from the above example:\n- Completely declarative (no imperative JS required)\n- No boilerplate querySelectors required\n- No boilerplate addEventListeners required\n- Good points for readability and understanding author intent\n- Are there times where you may need to dynamically create and throw away XHR&#x27;s based on complex heuristics that don&#x27;t readily fit into a declarative model like above, or when the maintainability benefits of doing so don&#x27;t justify whatever (hopefully small) cost there is to instantiating an element and holding it in the DOM while the view is in use vs. using the xhr API imperatively?  (rhetorical question: survey says...?)\n- In those cases, Polymer doesn&#x27;t force it&#x27;s opinion on you that in a lot of cases declarative elements can be good.  In those cases, make your xhr calls imperatively like you do today, and apply the component model in the vast majority of other cases where it does make sense.<p>Time will tell how developers apply this new component model, and Polymer is doing a lot of experimentation in the open to try and push those boundaries and see what sticks.",1404244172

To get truly white light, you need to have a continuous spectrum of different wavelengths, such as one might obtain from a radiating blackbody at a sufficiently high temperature.<p>RGB was chosen exactly because of trichromatic vision.  It <i>simulates</i> white light because it produces biological activation in the eye indistinguishable from truly white light.  A tetrachromat pigeon could look at one of our screens and complain that what we see as white was actually lacking in ultraviolet light.  But our eyes are not receptive to UV, so we just leave it out.<p>Choosing other colors for display would simply be a waste of  power, as those colors would be both less efficient and less selective when activating cone cells on human retinas.<p>Print pigments are cyan, magenta, and yellow because those are most efficient at creating colors in ink or paint that humans cannot discern from the color of a natural object.  The whole game is about ensuring that the light levels in the three color channels that most humans can use are identical.<p>True color reproduction, that matches absorption and reflection spectra across light frequencies from ultraviolet down to infrared, would require instrumentation more sensitive than the human eye.  Paints have more than just CMYK in them, because cost-effective, stable, and non-toxic pigments don&#x27;t necessarily match what is convenient for the human eye.  So paints may have varying quantities of red ochre, titanium white, carbon black, ultramarine, cochineal, etc.  And this is why you have to go to the hardware store to look at the paint chips under different lighting conditions.  The color gamut of paint pigments simply cannot be accurately reproduced by most computer monitors, because there is some overlap in the frequencies that activate our three color channels.<p>The blue light from your monitor also activates some green in your eye.  The green also activates some red and some blue.  The red also stimulates green.  So there are some colors you cannot see on your monitor, simply because the light used is not specific enough to your color channels.  That is the basis for the &quot;eclipse of Mars&quot; illusion.  That overstimulates the red channel until your brain starts to ignore it, allowing a blue-green background to appear as a true cyan instead of cyan with a little bit of red in it.",1404243661

It still seems odd that red and green can be combined at all, much less produce a pure yellow.</i><p>But that&#x27;s just what the CMY(K) model says. The CMY(K) model is the meaningful one in everyday life. In actual reality, with human eyes observing physical light filtered by pigments, blue is just cyan with a little magenta in it, and red is just magenta with a little yellow in it. The truth is, in the real world, you will never be able to make cyan or magenta if all you have is yellow, red and blue paint. But you will be able to make red or blue if you have yellow, magenta and cyan paint.<p>I think this might just be a case of people insisting to use less precise but more familiar names for colours, maybe. Maybe in English &quot;cyan&quot; and &quot;magenta&quot; sound like strange colours while blue and red sound more familiar and comforting. But insisting on using blue instead of cyan actually restricts your ability to draw colours.",1404243589

We&#x27;re already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we&#x27;re making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there&#x27;s one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We&#x27;re rapidly adding new features, and we&#x27;re quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX/UI designer.<p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.<p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.<p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.<p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.<p>List of Skills: - UI/UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML/CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.<p>We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We’re small (3 in-office employees) and we’re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we’re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.<p>Send an email to fintechw14@gmail.com telling us about yourself.

But that doesn&#x27;t mean they &quot;had full awareness of every language feature available in the alternatives&quot;, and even if they did, smart people are still susceptible to the blub paradox.<p>As for use in production, I agree that it can be a fair barometer for &quot;utility&quot;, but I strongly disagree that it&#x27;s a good measure of &quot;quality&quot; (as in, technical design choices).  We live in a path-dependent world rife with network effects, so quality per se just doesn&#x27;t matter all that much, and non-technical factors like &quot;being backed by a major corporation&quot; can matter a lot.

Now knowing my way around it reasonably well, it&#x27;s not an issue for <i>me</i> anymore, but not a newcomer.<p>It&#x27;s so easy to do it the wrong way, and there&#x27;s so many examples of badly written or non-idiomatic C++ code strewn all over the internet that a newbie is bound to fall into that trap. This is the same kind of problem I (used to) see with PHP, that it can be fine if you do it all the &quot;right way&quot; and don&#x27;t do &quot;stupid stuff&quot; but it takes a while to learn what those are.

I don&#x27;t fine the syntax to be the worst thing about JavaScript, so CoffeeScript has never seems that compelling to me.<p>TypeScript does a little more by offering types and classes, but it&#x27;s still a superset of JavaScript and can&#x27;t fix major issues because of backwards compatibility. I like TypeScript, but I prefer to go a lot farther.<p>Dart fixes a lot of fundamental issues with JavaScript, largely related to having a well-defined structure that humans and tools can reason about. This makes it easier for the VM to optimize too.<p>Here&#x27;s a grab bag of things that Dart has over JavaScript:<p>* Dart has libraries, and library scope, no global scope. All code must be imported to be used.\n * It has true classes with inheritance, interfaces and mixins. Objects are closed, so you can&#x27;t accidentally add a new property because of a typo, and you get static warnings about undefined property names.\n * Dart has optional type annotations and a static type checker. We catch a lot of bugs when porting JavaScript code to Dart and adding types.\n * There are no top-level statements, only variable, function and class declarations. A program always starts at main().\n * True lexical block scoping. No function scoping.\n * Final variables and library private names.\n * There are generics and they are reified.\n * &#x27;this&#x27; is lexically bound, removing a whole swath of confusing patterns and bugs.\n * There is no implicit type coercion or boolean conversion. Being more explicit in boolean contexts reduces bugs.\n * There are real collections like Maps, Lists, and Sets. They are interfaces and can be implemented by users.\n * Dart has operator overloading\n * There is an actor-like unit of concurrency call Isolates\n * Metadata annotations (@something) can be processed by build-time and runtime tools.\n * noSuchMethod() let&#x27;s you catch undefined method calls.<p>All combined, I find Dart to be much easier to code in and much, much easier to read and navigate. Jump into a new Dart codebase and the types give you a lot of information.

Also, you&#x27;re missing an important keyword--they&#x27;re &quot;event&quot; streams. Stream in this context just means an ordered set of momentary events occurring in more or less real time--a button was clicked, the server responded, a sensor reading was taken, an item was purchased, etc.<p>In order to get a good understanding of FRP, it would probably first help to understand laziness as found in Haskell or .NET IEnumerable/yield return or Python&#x27;s generators, etc. The gist is that you have a function that can return a value and then effectively pause it&#x27;s execution until you call it again. A simple example is an infinite counter: the first time you call it, it returns 1; the next time it remembers that it had previously returned 1 and so it adds one more and returns two, etc.<p>Usually when this kind of laziness is considered, it&#x27;s the job of the calling code to say, &quot;I&#x27;m ready for more data&quot; and then &#x27;pull&#x27; the next chunk. In FRP, this is reversed--the client/calling code says, &quot;let me know if/when anything interesting happens&quot; and the stream &#x27;pushes&#x27; data to the subscriber. The functional part comes into play when you start manipulating the pulled or pushed data by specifying functions as arguments to the &#x27;higher-ordered&#x27; functions that work on the data. I.e., when we get the data, do this() to it and then do that()--where &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; are variables/function-pointers.",1404242002

I&#x27;m not interested in that kind of low-brow discussion. But I see why you don&#x27;t agree with that characterization. So I&#x27;ll back off on that point.<p>I do think you&#x27;re making a very serious error (albeit common in philosphers and mathematicians).<p>What you are saying is that mathematics is derived from a set of axioms, and therefore is true &quot;by definition,&quot; whereas truth about the real world is something else. And you have a harder time in various ways) with non-mathematical truth. The foundations there are shakier.<p>However, the foundations actually are not shakier. They just aren&#x27;t as widely known among philosophers (or common people). I&#x27;m not going to try to explain it here. That would be ridiculous. But to say one important thing that most people miss: You have to realize that knowledge is only valid in its context. It is contextual. So it is true to say, for example, that Earth orbits the Sun. It could turn out that we all live in the Matrix and that Earth doesn&#x27;t orbit the Sun, but that claim would still have been true in the current context (where we have no reason to assume we live in the Matrix). Likewise, Newtonian mechanics can never be invalidated by later discoveries, because it is true in its context, i.e. at a macro scale. I don&#x27;t know if this point will help you, but it is one barrier to getting scientific knowledge on a non-shaky foundation.<p>A separate point: while it&#x27;s true that you can have a mathematical system with arbitrary axioms, you can also have a mathematical system that describes reality that is developed using philosophical (as opposed to mathematical) induction (just like all &quot;scientific&quot; truths), and thus that is actual true in a scienfic sense, and which is NOT based on axioms.<p>For instance, you can define a mathematics where 1 + 1 is 2, but you can also induce this rule from reality by looking at objects.<p>You can define a mathematics where 1 + 1 is 1, but you can&#x27;t induce that from reality, because it isn&#x27;t true in reality.<p>Really, the point of mathematics is to improve human life, not to be an idle pasttime for professors that don&#x27;t have moral qualms with getting paid by taxpayers yet not rendering them a service. So the point of mathematics should be to look at mathematics as it can be induced from reality, and figure out things that are not only true in what you call a mathematical sense, but also true in reality. It&#x27;s also fine to look at made-up mathematics, but only in that that sometimes turns into useful discoveries for real mathematics.",1404241770

7972822,comment,7972632,7972632,1,0,supporting,,,"In Memoriam, Google Dart, 201X:<p>A few years ago, Dart was Google’s first foray into web programming languages. Built as a “20 percent” project, Dart developers started conversations, and built web applications that had never existed before. Dart helped shape the future of the browser before people really knew what “Beyond JavaScript” was.<p>Over the past decade, TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript and ES7 have taken off, with communities springing up in every corner of the world. Because the growth of these communities has outpaced Dart&#x27;s growth, we&#x27;ve decided to bid Dart farewell (or, &quot;adiós&quot;). We&#x27;ll be focusing our energy and resources on making these other development platforms as amazing as possible for everyone who uses them.<p>We will shut down Dart within the next 3 months. Until then, there will be no impact on current Dart users, to give the programming community time to manage the transition. People can transpile their applications into JavaScript using Google Takeout (available until next year). Starting today, it will not be possible download or patch updates to existing copies of the Dart compiler.<p>Dart, the language, may be going away, but all of those incredible web apps that Dart users have created will live on. We are preserving an archive of the best of the bunch, which will be available online during this transitional period. If you don&#x27;t want your app or name to be included in the community archive, you can remove Dart permanently from your Google account by visiting your YouTube preferences page, and clicking on &quot;Advanced Settings&quot;. Please visit our Help Center for further details.<p>It&#x27;s been a great few years, and we apologize to those still actively using the language. We hope people will find other programming communities to spark more projections and build even more amazing applications for the next decade and beyond.<p>---<p>(This is just in good fun ;) Likely? No. Possible? Sure seems to be.)",1404241670

I.E.:<p>In Rust you can type<p><pre><code>     fn id<T> ( item:T) -> T\n     {\n           return item;\n     }\n</code></pre>\nAnd you assign the type to the function.

When you want to signify data doesn&#x27;t exist in Go you pass a null pointer (nil, 0x0). This is wrong on almost every single level.

Why?!<p>:.:.:<p>Immutable variables, data structures, etc. are a thing of beauty. In Rust and Haskell all values are immutable by default, but most languages (C, C++, Java) let you delcare variables, data structures, etc. as immutable....

7972807,comment,7972015,7972392,2,0,Zancarius,,,"> For one, I learnt in school that the primary colours where red, green and blue, and later that the substractive primary colours where cyan, magenta and yellow. So nothing different from the RGB/CMYK colour wheels everyone uses.<p>I thought I was going insane for a moment, because (though it&#x27;s been <i>years</i>) I swore I was taught the same thing. Perhaps it&#x27;s an artifact of having grown up in a &quot;modern&quot; world where additive and subtractive palettes are important, but thinking back on it, I remember the science classes and the &quot;light experiment&quot; of using different colored flashlights to produce white (from red, green, and blue--though not perfect because of the colors of cellophane used, and kids generally don&#x27;t care).<p>While I realize art has a long history (and I appreciate the contributions it has made to society at large), scientific discovery has arguably made more important inroads on the why and how of colors. Interestingly, the Wikipedia article [1] on the subject links to the &quot;four psychological primary colors&quot; [2] of red, green, yellow, and blue. Yes, the RYB model is interesting (at least historically) and important to painters, but even prior to modern science what constituted &quot;primary colors&quot; seems to have been more inclusive than just a three color system.<p>I don&#x27;t wish to seem ungrateful: I do appreciate the work the author put into the article (and appreciate the dissemination of the paper linked to on the RYB system), and I admit (not being an artist) that it&#x27;s difficult for me to understand what seems like fairly superficial complaints relayed through him from his artist friend. It almost seems like it&#x27;s being dismissive of what we know about our visual physiology for no other reason than &quot;this is how they used to do it.&quot;<p>Interesting nevertheless, but like you, it&#x27;s difficult for me to see the point: So there&#x27;s a niche need for artists who don&#x27;t like the existing color system?

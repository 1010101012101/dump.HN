It's the big events, like betting against the dotcom crash, betting against enron, etc, which make or break this size fund.<p>Those are the 9 or 10 events I'm talking about. These people are probably rarely betting on something more than 1:10 odds. But for those huge cases, they were probably getting 1:100 or 1:1000. Those are the ones it is so important to be on the right side of, and dampen quite a bit of suboptimal whatever in the meanwhile.<p>He quite specifically bet against the housing and dotcom boom as mentioned in the article, therefore shows to be betting most importantly on those 1:1000 events.",1272232697

In just three months, I've lost count of the number of useful introductions he's made or things he's helped with. Granted he's an investor in YC so he has a reason for doing so but he goes beyond the standard level of being helpful into something more, it's that bit extra he doesn't have to do. I intend to model my approach to 'networking' entirely upon how Ron does it - by being genuinely benevolent and helpful to people I meet.",1272232665

Gm has not gone out of business, and while I would not place any money on gm thriving in the future, it is still within the realm of possibilities that they could.  If the point of the bailout was to save gm from failing, you cannot declare the bailout as having failed unless gm fails.  Likewise, you can't claim that gm won't pay back the money eventually as long as they remain in business.  You can say the bailout is likely to fail, but that is hugely different from saying it has already failed.",1272231889

(debugging a project)",,"I have written a crawler for a pair of major file-sharing DHTs (Azureus/Vuze and Mojito (used by Limewire)) for a graduate-level distributed systems project, and I'm at a bit of a loss as to why it's failing only on EC2 and only for Mojito.<p>The crawling process is very similar to the  crawler described in http://www.eurecom.fr/util/publidownload.en.htm?id=2495 . Briefly, it works by breadth-first search: the crawler sends 8-16 find-node packets to a node it has not yet interrogated; the response to such a packet is a list of more nodes in the network. It adds the nodes that it has not yet seen to its list of nodes to crawl, and repeats the process. The scan is limited to sending 9000 packets per second, and terminates when there have been no packets sent for 30 seconds. netstat -su shows <100 UDP receive errors on the offending EC2 box.<p>On a local box, it sees 1,163,777 nodes, and gets responses from 300,638 of them (the difference can be attributed to stale routing table entries, NATed nodes, etc.). On EC2, where I was hoping for <i>greater</i> network visibility, it sees only ~200,000 nodes, and gets responses from only ~2700. It is in fact the case that EC2 seems to have greater visibility for Vuze.<p>I am running on two high-CPU extra-large instances, one for Vuze and one for Mojito. They are both in us-east, but different availability zones. The Vuze one has been working great for hours; I am wondering if there is some kind of EC2 global bandwidth limit or DPI that could be whitelisting the Vuze traffic but not Mojito, or perhaps some other EC2 networking quirk? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!",1272231657

In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, no one really knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.""<p>John von Neumann to Claude Shannon",1272229531

It all seems pretty simple and straightforward. Especially physicists fall into that trap again and again, up to great string theorists putting forward anthropocentric theories of the universe. These people usually make trivial mistakes that any real philosopher spots in no time. Intelligence is not a substitute for knowledge and this guy seem to have fallen into the same trap as well. In this case you don't even need to be a philosopher. He defines information based on the frequency of 'events'. This means that both time and 'events' are more primal than his notion of 'information'. Consequently, 'information' is not at the root of anything. And how could it be, if we need minds and language to discuss 'information' in the first place?",1272229363

A single binary with no dependencies that can be cross-compiled on a Heroku dyno makes things <i>much</i> simpler.<p>Foreman was originally written in Ruby which ideally means it runs on any machine with a Ruby interpreter. When you get down to it, though, the differences in fork/exec between Ruby 1.8, 1.9, JRuby, Rubinius, etc make this a nightmare scenario of a different sort.<p>If you go to <a href=""https://gobuild.herokuapp.com/ddollar/forego/master/darwin/amd64"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gobuild.herokuapp.com/ddollar/forego/master/darwin/a...</a> you get a working program as a single binary in one step.

It is not particularly useful for determining questions where the evidence is not readily apparent (such as, obviously, &#x27;Is the NSA spying on Americans?&#x27;).<p>One may easily use the absence of evidence of woolly mammoths to conclude that woolly mammoths are extinct. Given their physical size (they are easy to detect) they could not remain hidden from view. We can assume (from our knowledge of other large mammals) that they would leave signs of their presence wherever they trod (footprints, dung, etc.) It is not so easy to use absence of evidence to disprove the existence of neutrinos or tree shrews. Both neutrinos and shrews are hard to detect. There are few people even qualified to attempt to detect them, fewer who are interested, and even fewer who have the resources and opportunity.<p>A relevant question is &quot;Is it possible for spies to conduct espionage undetected for an extended period of time?&quot; The answer is yes, there is ample evidence of that. Schneier is clearly in a place of trust in his community, making him a high value target. The standards of evidence for betrayal of trust being high (and difficult to define), mean that Schneier could potentially be a spy/collaborator in some capacity, and/or could become one at any time.",1382532727

I just want to mention that, as far I know, the output of a JIT compiler does not have to me machine (native) code. A JIT compiler is just an algorithm that transforms some well defined input to a different representation that is better suited for the current situation (hardware). The main &quot;feature&quot; of a JIT compiler is that this transformation is done while the app is running.<p>So the Qt people could have written a JIT for iOS. The only thing that can&#x27;t be done on iOS is to write a JIT that transforms the input to native code and execute it. But this is only one of many use cases of JIT compilers.",1382532408

Get those priorities wrong and you will starve.<p>Your living is trading time for money. If a client is refusing to pay, you are losing at least triple your hourly rate (the time you worked for free, the time you spend chasing them for payment and the time you could have been working for someone who does pay).<p>You need to immediately stop work, issue a full invoice and say that no more work (including packaging and sending source code) will be done until the outstanding invoice is paid in full. Then later on, if they hire you for more work,  insist on prepayment.<p>If they flip out, fire them as a client and find a better client. Life is too short and stressful as it is to live with bad clients.<p>May sound harsh, but 10 months late on an invoice and bullying you with the law sounds like a toxic client relationship where the client has no respect for you. If you continue to be nice to them, they&#x27;ll continue to walk all over you and leech as much free work as possible before you finally give up and (because you&#x27;re nice) fade away into the shadows without getting paid.<p>If it&#x27;s a large amount (exceeds small claims), see a lawyer. If under, wait for them to send you a lawyer&#x27;s letter (most bullying clients who threaten legal action won&#x27;t ever follow through), then file a small claims action for the full value of the invoices plus expenses.<p>Collecting money from deadbeat freelance clients is one of the few times in this world when being an aggressive a-hole is justified and effective.",1382530936

In the case of that ladder, that the guy won&#x27;t let go. In the case of the physician and psychiatrist that they won&#x27;t share information about you.<p>The NSA stuff can be seen in that light, there is a betrayal of trust as the basis for trust in a government spy agency was that they wouldn&#x27;t do a certain thing... spy on their own people. The rest is all forgiveable (you pretty much should expect them to spy on everyone else whether you agree with it or not, that&#x27;s their purpose).<p>When it comes to Bruce Schneier the question is &quot;Do you trust Bruce Schneier?&quot;, but this seems to just beg the next question, &quot;To not do what?&quot;.<p>I trust Bruce Schneier to not sacrifice his own principles and belief system in backdooring some code or otherwise compromising his work.<p>But I don&#x27;t necessarily trust Bruce Schneier to hold a ladder that I&#x27;m standing on (he may well have a sense of humour that reflects silent cinema, and being up a ladder was never a good thing when a Loki character was holding it).",1382529886

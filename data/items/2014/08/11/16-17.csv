8164059,comment,8163652,8163652,18,0,DavidAdams,,,"San Francisco is has extremely low population density across vast swaths of its territory for a city with such a high demand for housing. And, unlike other world cities, most of the buildings are not architectural masterpieces with historic value. They&#x27;re cheaply built, ugly little boxes. The only things that will reduce this tension would be limiting the number of people allowed to move into the city (obviously not legal) or increasing the supply of housing. There isn&#x27;t a lot of new land, but it would be easy to increase the density by a factor of 2-3x by giving developers incentive to raze lower density housing and replace it with larger buildings. The could be compelled to pay impact fees and fund neighborhood improvements to ensure that transit capacity, parking, public amenities, and street life are actually improved rather than degraded.<p>Unfortunately, the current regulatory climate in SF is 180 degrees opposed to this solution, with NIMBYism run rampant and any improvement or expansion of existing housing stock subject to a thicket of roadblocks and regulations.",1407776384

If your culture expects a dowry, what you can afford may influence who you are allowed to marry or whether a marriage can happen or not.<p>Second, the tradition of the bride&#x27;s family paying in the U.S. has significantly lessened over the years. More young people pay for their own weddings or share the cost with their parents.<p>My parents&#x27;s paid for the bulk of my small wedding (which despite being deliberately small and my hack of avoiding having to pay for the location, was still probably $20k once my dress, the reception, airfare/hotel for my parents and sister, flowers, photos and other assorted pre-wedding meals were dealt with -- weddings are just fucking expensive), and were happy to do it (and were happy they were able to do it), but if they would have been unable to cover the bill, my husband and I -- or his family -- would have stepped in, no questions asked.

We scraped college and university websites to get class schedule information: which classes were being taught, broken down by department and course number; by which professors; at which times on which days. If you&#x27;re ever looking for an interesting challenge, I would encourage you to try getting this data.<p>Well-formed HTML is the exception rather than the rule and page navigation is often &quot;interesting&quot;. Sometimes the school&#x27;s system will use software from companies like Sungard or PeopleSoft, but there&#x27;s customization within that... and of course, there&#x27;s no incentive for the schools to aggregate this information in a common format (hence MyEdu&#x27;s initiative), so there are plenty of homegrown systems. In short, there&#x27;s no one-size-fits-all solution.<p>* NOTE: If you do attempt this, I insist that you teach throttling techniques from the very start.

Getting the results structured is somewhere between easy and hideously complicated.<p>1. Reformatting and content archival (lag times of hours to days are no prob).<p>As an example, I put together <a href=""http://yareallyarchive.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yareallyarchive.com</a> to archive comments of a ridiculously prolific commenter on a site I follow. I needed the content of his comments, as well as the tree structure to shake out all the irrelevant comments leaving only the necessary context. Real time isn&#x27;t an issue. Up until recently it ran on a weekly cron job. Now it&#x27;s daily.<p>2. Aggregating and structuring data from disparate sources (real time can make you money).<p>I work in commercial real estate. Leasing websites are shitty and the information companies are expensive and also kinda shitty. Where possible we scrape the websites for building availability but a lot of time that data is buried in PDFs. For a lot of business domains, being able to scrape data in a structured way from PDFs would be killer if you could do it! I guarantee the industries chollida1 mentioned want the hell out of this too. We enter the PDFs manually. :(<p>Updates go in monthly cycles, timeliness isn&#x27;t a huge issue. Lag times of ~3-5 business days are just fine especially for the things that need to be manually entered.<p>This is exactly the sort of scraping that Pricenomics is doing [1]. They charge $2k/site/month. Hopefully y&#x27;all are making that much.<p>3. Bespoke, one shot versions of #2.<p>One shot data imports, typically to initially populate a database. I&#x27;ve done a ton of these and I hate them. An example is a farmer&#x27;s market project I worked on. We got our hands on a shitty national database of farmers markets, I ended up writing a custom parser that worked in ~85% of cases and we manually cleaned up the rest. The thing that sucks about one shot scrape jobs from bad sources is that it almost always means manual cleanup. It&#x27;s just not worth it to write code that works 100% when it will only be used once.<p>Make any part of structuring scraped data easier and you guys are awesome!<p>[1] <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/data-services/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/data-services/</a>",1407775506

For instance:<p>- Using Vertex Array Objects should be fast since it&#x27;s only a single call to change the vertex data binding. But in many GL implementations they are slower then using the old way calling VertexAttribPointer and EnableVertexAttribArray<p>- What&#x27;s the fastest way to update dynamic vertex data? Buffer orphaning? Doing double buffering yourself? BufferData or BufferSubData? It&#x27;s likely that the answer is different dependent on driver or GPU<p>Resource binding can introduce subtle errors by screwing up the GL state (for instance to create and initialize a resource you need to &#x27;make it current&#x27;, should the creation function restore the previous binding, or keep the GL state &#x27;dirty&#x27;?)<p>Some call parameters are overloaded with completely different meaning depending on GL state. For instance the &#x27;const void* pointer&#x27; argument in VertexAttribPointer is actually an integer offset and not a pointer if an array buffer is bound.<p>The most important problem which the OpenGL NG initiative tries to solve is validation overhead. In current OpenGL, an app can change every state at every time in the frame, and after each change (or rather before each draw call) the entire GL state must be validated. Most games (or 3D apps in general) only create a relatively small set of &#x27;pre-compiled&#x27; state at startup and then just switch between these state presets. With this pattern, all expensive validation can happen once at startup, and not during the render loop.",1407775312

The vision is a bit larger and includes fusing data from various sources in a probabilistic way (e.g. the same people, products, or companies found on different sides with ambiguous names and information. This is based on the research I&#x27;ve doen at uni). However, I found that there are no web crawling frameworks out there that allow for large-scale and continuous crawling of changing data. So the first step has become to actually write such a system myself, and perhaps even open source it.<p>In terms of use cases, here are some I&#x27;ve come across:<p>- Product pricing data: Many companies collect pricing data from e-commerce sites. Latency and temporal trends are important here. Believe it or not, there are still profitable companies out there that hire people to manually scrape websites and input data into a database.<p>- Various analyses based on job listing data: Similar to what you do by looking at which websites contain certain widgets, you can start understanding job listing (using NLP) to find out which technologies are used by which companies. Several startups doing this. Great data for bizdev and sales. You can also use job data to understand technology hiring trends, understand the long-term strategies of competitor&#x27;s, or us them as a signal for the health of a company.<p>- News data + NLP: Crawling news data and understanding facts mentioned in news (using Natural Language Processing) in real-time is used in many industries. Finance, M&A, etc.<p>- People data: Crawl public LinkedIn and Twitter profiles to understand when people are switching jobs/careers, etc.<p>- Real-estate data: Understand pricing trends and merge information from similar listings found on various real estate listing websites.<p>- Merging signals and information from different sources: For example, crawl company websites, Crunchbase, news articles related to the company, LinkedIn profile&#x27;s of employees and combine all the information found in various source to arrive at meaningful structured representation. Not limited to companies, you can probably think of other use cases.<p>In general, I think there is a lot of untapped potential and useful data in combining the capabilities of large-scale web scraping, Natural Language Processing, and information fusion / entity resolution.<p>Getting changing data with low latency (and exposing it as a stream) is still very difficult, and there are lots of interesting use cases as well.<p>Hope this helps.

Automation will have a big impact on medicine, but it will be an ongoing process, not something that happens overnight. If you&#x27;re doing a joint MD/PhD(EE) program, then you&#x27;ll presumably at least have some technical qualifications that would make you more appealing to a company that is working towards the automation of healthcare.<p>2. You might be able to start a business on the side, but not as a resident unless residencies become immensely less stressful and time-consuming. Part-time work as an oncologist may be hard to negotiate early in your medical career, but I am not a doctor (though I did investigate similar questions a few years back, and this was the impression I got from speaking with doctors and MD/PhDs). Financial feasibility... as an MD/PhD, you shouldn&#x27;t have much in the way of personal debt (since the PhD covers the MD tuition as well), and I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to be dipping too close to the poverty line.<p>Realistically, it depends a lot on whether you have a specific business idea in mind and what your drive looks like. Those aren&#x27;t things that you can plan very well 20 years in advance.",1407775046

Most of the other popular dynamic languages (Python, Ruby, Perl) offer or even require package signing.  npm does require SSL, but package signing is even more important, since only package signing can prevent the scenario I describe above.<p>That said, I do see lots of unit testing in node packages, so I can&#x27;t criticize them there.",1407774233

8163869,comment,8163297,8163297,1,0,kerberus,,,"Hi! I&#x27;m an MD/PhD student, in my final PhD year (6+2, Netherlands). I&#x27;m working on computer navigation in orthopedic oncology, basically objective navigation in the OR. This, together with some small sidesteps into 3d printing and computer supported diagnostic imaging. The combination of medicine and technology is an awesome field to be in. There are so many projects that you can work on.<p>As Xaa has written, most doctors are not focused on technology. They will use it, understand it but especially the older ones do not embrace the possibilities automation or innovation can offer. That coupled with slow development and access to the market makes us lag behind other high-tech/high-impact industries (for example aviation).<p>Do not underestimate how hard it is for automation to completely take over a doctors job. In 50 years we will still need radiologist. The tools you will develop will support your and others workflows, making healthcare better. And if it replaces a certain task, others will arise, as for example radio frequency ablation has a growing role in oncology. (and is often done by a radiologist!)<p>Furthermore there are legal implications. Surgery will not be completely automated (fire and forget)in the next decades, simply because of this. A surgeon always has to be present. For example: the most chosen approach for robotics in orthopedics is assisted surgery, where you move the tool and the robot blocks you from making bad moves.<p>So, as an MD/PhD you will be a bridge between two completely different cultures. I sometimes joke that the engineers we talk to have a solution for a non-existing problem and doctors no technical solution for an existing problem. It&#x27;s actually really hard to understand each others fields. So in this you are valuable!<p>You seem very motivated! I can only draw conclusions on my choice, but I can recommend it! If you have any questions ask away.",1407774182

Even the little dirt roads were there. I had three problems with the app. The navigation did not wanted to respect my setting for &quot;prefer highways&quot;, we always tried to regenerate the route, &quot;we are near, maybe now it will know&quot;. Seemed like it hated highways. The app felt very buggy, I know it is free, but froze a lot of times and has un-intuitive controls. For example if I wanted to add navigation to a target it sometimes used a location from yesterday or something totally unrelated. Asking a question &quot;Do you want to keep the current route?&quot; it sometimes keeps the current route, sometimes reverts back to a route before, sometimes even just shows where I was yesterday. Third is, searching is a PITA. Because a lot of house numbers are missing you can only input intersections, sometimes it works, sometimes not. Searching for POI-s is good (remember, it is offline), but a lot of things are missing. I found if I add favorites and want a route between them then that usually works. (I don&#x27;t know how the app creators are related to OSM.)<p>Anyway, I recommend the app because it is valuable and usable if you don&#x27;t have connection (and free if you use only 10 maps).<p>Recently I wanted to use a web based map in one of my project and I found it is very easy to use OSM with <a href=""http://leafletjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leafletjs.com/</a>. It has some bugs (I couldn&#x27;t get a &quot;map loaded&quot; event out of it, maybe it is just me) but overall I think it was easier to set up than a google map. The one thing I missed is the geocoding of addresses, it is not really reliable because of the missing house numbers, instead of OSM I used the google solution and they can work together flawlessly.<p>I am glad to see a free map solution gaining popularity. Where I live there are events for mapping.

However, it happened in 1 day !<p>Facebook is supposed to be this big brother that knows everything you like, knows your whole circle of friend and acquaintance even maybe your inner thoughts. But in reality, it will forget everything if you have one day out of the ordinary.<p>Very quickly, the monetization model that Facebook uses is basically taking over the social aspect of the website. If you like it, chances are Twitter or even Reddit will give you a much better experience. That&#x27;s a bit like if Google decided that you like ads so much you only want to see that and not the search result anymore. That&#x27;s certainly something that Facebook investors should look at.",1407772989

Their &#x27;Mapbox Streets&#x27; you can get if you use their API is amazing (better in some ways than Google Maps) and they also have a quite nice open source style called &#x27;OSM Bright&#x27; that you can use on your own render server.<p>I would like the default style on OSM.org to be a bit nicer, but the problem is that that site is designed more for editors than users - the point of that map is to try and show as much info as possible - half the battle to get a really good looking map is getting rid of information you don&#x27;t need to show.",1407772861

But this is hardly a new or useful insight, almost all code has known bugs in it at the time it ships and the additional value of discovering another bug is generally quite low. The value of discovering bugs lies in understanding how they relate to an undesired behaviour of a running system.",1407772800

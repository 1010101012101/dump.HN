I believe the relevant chapters are called ""A radical critique of American universities"" and ""The impossibility of a university"".<p>Of course, this was pre-internet.<p>Someone needs to tell Mr. Friedman about the open access movement so I can stop telling people about his works and start linking to them.",1204005590

For such people, if they wish to develop there really is no choice: they need to move to the centers of world learning, and seek out the brightest people they can, to challenge and teach them.<p>But for people who are merely bright and interested, and perhaps not able to afford Harvard's fees (or otherwise gain acceptance), what I propose might have some considerable value.",1204005540

123673,comment,123559,123559,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I think the main problem is that this presupposes that people go to college to learn. Most don't. They go to get a degree.<p>Degrees act as passports to jobs. Employers value degrees because of their scarcity and the work/selection involved in getting one. Give away too many, and they won't anymore. No brand name school could risk this.<p>For example, someone with a Stanford MBA can get a high-paying job pretty easily. Employers value the Stanford MBA because it does much of the pre-screening for them (it's hard to get into the program, and presumably hard to get through.)If Stanford churned out 1 million MBAs a year, they would become useless.<p>I think this would dilute the brand beyond meaning.",1204005319

123670,comment,123489,123489,0,0,BrandonM,,,"It's a great story, but I'm not sure that I'm buying it. The conclusion is what bothers me; he says the timeout was three milliseconds and proceeds to convert 3 millilightseconds to 558.85 miles. So what's the problem? The packets have to go there <i>and back</i> in 3 milliseconds. This means that the 558.85 miles is for the round trip, meaning that any places more than, say, 250 miles away should have had issues. For me, this destroys the premise of the whole article, since it contradicts things he said throughout.<p>The idea, though, that something like this could feasibly happen is certainly true, and made for interesting reading.",1204005092

123663,comment,123468,123560,0,0,altano,,,"Yeah, I completely agree, but I don't think most people realize what this means.  Deciding to make something simple isn't a choice you make up front.  It's something you fight the whole way through.  You have to fight your own temptations to add instead of subtract, you have to fight the cries of users who want just one more feature, etc.  The simple thing to do will rarely be obvious<p>Look at the reaction to arc's release: it made people (who probably had no intention of building anything in it in the first place) enraged at its initial lack of unicode support.  Imagine that... enraged at the lack of unicode support in the initial release of a programming language.  It's hard to look at that reaction and realize what it really means: that Paul's probably on to something.",1204004526
123662,comment,123509,123509,0,0,BrandonM,,,"This article is bad mainly because it relies on a strawman as an example. Any (reasonably rational) business owner would love to have a salesman like John, probably promoting him to a higher position where he can have an even better influence. The whole idea of putting a cap on what an employee can earn is a socialistic practice, anyways (don't want employees getting too ""unequal""), and has nothing at all to do with capitalism.<p>Do mistakes happen? Yes. Do companies, owners, and other people in power make bad decisions? All the time. Does that mean that capitalism doesn't work?<p>The problem, in my mind, is the one that YCombinator is trying to solve. There are not enough owners. There is not enough competition. The more competition there is among smallish businesses, the more likely that big, inefficient companies and other companies that make bad decisions (like firing your best salesman) will fail.<p>One reason there aren't many owners is all the red tape and government control. Two examples:<p>My stepmother has been breeding and selling German Shepherds for over ten years now, and she gets customers from all over the US. To go along with the dog-selling aspect, she would like to open up a small shop to sell dog food, leashes, toys, etc. Simple enough, right? In order to do so, they would have to install a new septic/sewage system, just so that they can run a business. Why is this important? Also, in spite of the fact that she is always accommodating to people with special needs (e.g. she would be perfectly willing to carry out an entire litter of puppies in order to show someone in a wheelchair), she would have to take special measures to ensure that all public areas are wheelchair accessible. So she hasn't opened the place up yet.<p>I just watched <i>Be Kind, Rewind</i> today, and although several of the ideas were far-fetched and irrational, one part in particular hit home. A new developer would like to take over an old building in the downtown area of a small town, and the city can basically force the owner out of his business by citing ""building code"" requirements. Things like this actually happen in real life; I've seen a similar situation with a building in Columbus, OH, that was not up to fire code.<p>In both instances, small businesses are suffering because of big government. In both cases, laws were made ""in the interest of the people,"" but in the end, they hurt the people.<p>In my ideal world, the government would be more responsible for ensuring consumer awareness without the use of coercion. Clearly, people have the right to know that they are preparing to enter a dangerous building. Beyond that, however, if that individual wants to take the calculated risk of going in, anyways (whether to work or conduct business), it should be up to the individual. Government hand-holding only causes more problems, and the implication of the article that government needs to step in and make measures to ensure that capitalism ""rewards wealth creators"" is mistaken.<p>/rant (sorry about that)",1204004306

123659,comment,123509,123631,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I voted it up because I think it's a great reminder why we should want to be owners and not employees. That is the part of the attraction of a startup... it's definitely more financially secure than a job, from which you can get fired. At a startup the worst you can do is fail and <i>have to get a job</i>.<p>John got the shaft in the short term, but Adidas got rid of their top salesman. John will recover and probably excel, while Adidas just guaranteed that their salesman will never try and achieve anything great. The most obvious effect of an action is not the most important, as stated above.",1204003931

I could list the 20 things I hate most about Ruby and the 20 things I hate most about Rails, and this wouldn't make either list.  I don't know that I've ever seen it happen.<p>And on the ""technically, could it happen?"" side, sure, it could.  You can also write a Java library that, in weird cases, could screw up other Java libraries, but the Java folks (even as much as they love to try to keep you safe) don't care, either.<p>Besides, ""each"" is quite standard in Ruby.  Defining it to mean something other than ""call the proc with each element, in order"" would be weirdbad, like a C++ programmer defining operator+ to mean subtraction.  If you do something weirdbad like that, your library deserves to lose.",1204003894

The only way to avoid that risk is to put your own capital on the line and be an owner (a founder is an owner, even if it only costs him $10 for the domain name).<p>If anything, this article shows why capitalism <i>does</i> work well. If we weren't using capitalism, John couldn't start over again. If we were under communism, and the State fires and blacklists you, you are screwed. All jobs belong to the state. If we were under feudalism, and the Lord 'fires' you (most likely by taking your plot of land and possibly just killing you), then you're only choice is to try and find another Lord to take you in. How is that better?<p>I'd bet the author wants a benevolent state to give us all jobs that pay the same amount. That is all fine and dandy, except then what would even be the point?

86609,comment,86506,86506,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The article failed to mention one thing -- corruption. In a chaotic, churning society, corruption is kept lower because you never know who's going to be in power next year. In China you always know. That makes it too tempting for little side deals to be set up. Every one of those side deals takes a little something from the rest of their society. That's why corruption is so officially scorned in China, although it is pervasive. <p>\nI don't see them overcoming this problem with their current system, much less moving to a service economy. But I wish them well.",1196948729
86608,comment,86506,86526,0,0,robg,,,"Chomsky once wrote about how the founding conditions of a country determine the eventual outcomes. They're extremely resistant to change because they're so deeply embedded with the fabric of the culture. And that seems especially true of this country with the constant social tension between freedoms and Puritanism. ",1196948341

86595,comment,86550,86589,0,0,Tichy,,,"Are you sure you need to install J2EE? You don't need the sun J2EE server-crap to develop J2EE applications! J2EE is two things, a specification with implementations by Apache, Bea, jBoss and others, and also an implementation by Sun, which probably sucks.<p>Perhaps you could use jBoss instead of the Sun garbage. I only ever have used Tomcat, though, so I can't really comment on the Application servers. OK, used Bea Weblogic, too, and recommend against it. <p>Also, what do you mean by applets - why do you need Applets for J2EE?",1196946021

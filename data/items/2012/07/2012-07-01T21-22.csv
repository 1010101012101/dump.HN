4186291,comment,4178128,4178185,1,0,pasbesoin,,,"I received raises like that, in a very conventional corporate environment and with strict cost controls in place, because I was basically saving my manager's bacon -- as I was internally hired to do -- and doing it a significantly less cost than the ""conventional"" (big iron) route.  He had significant seniority within our part of the org and used it to get this done.<p>But, that was fairly exceptional.<p>In another role at another corporation, I was repeatedly lauded by my coworkers -- the ones with whom I actually worked and who had real technical chops.  But my immediate org structure was more than a bit political, and my role was defined by corporate as a fairly mundane and low-level role.  4% was the cap, and almost no one got that.  Ability didn't rule the decision:  Executive-level budgets and politics did.<p>So... You've better assessed your value.  Be prepared to move one, before and when asking for it.  You may have to.  If you have a solid competing offer, this may also strengthen your argument/negotiation with your existing employer.  Don't ""threaten"" them; rather, an offer shows that someone -- an ""independent party"" or even a ""competitor"" -- considers that valuation to be fair.<p>A final caveat:  If you get to the point of having that offer, it may be best to leave and take it.  As others, I seem to recall, have pointed out, here, causing your existing employer to match a competitor's offer may breed unexpressed resentment on the part of your management.  And, regardless of that, they will worry about whether they will end up having to explain and justify the bump to other employees if and when asked about it and without facing wholesale escalation in their wage structure.<p>TL;DR:  Having stuck out assignments having low raises, I'd say you may have to -- and ultimately want to -- change jobs/employers.",1341179970

4186288,comment,4184317,4186056,7,0,hpatel,,,"You nailed it. The key problem is 'demand' is determined only by whoever has money. Capitalism works because each person gets a say in what is important and creates value for them. The problem is that if you don't have above a certain amount of money, you don't get much of a say. In the age of immense income inequality, this completely distorts the 'demand' generation aspect of capitalism.<p>What if we divorced 'demand'(what creates value for each person) from money (payment for value created) and gave all actors an equal right to determine demand irrespective of their ability to pay? We are working on building such a world.",1341179886

A few points of feedback:<p>- The pricing model is unclear. Are the account upgrades a one-time purchase, or a monthly cost? The amount seems reasonable for the former, and too much for the latter.<p>- One of the great things about wikis is the ability to create new pages from within the content, just by typing [[new page]] or whatever. It would be great if clicking an empty link spawned a new page form rather than a 404.<p>- Once immersed in a wiki's content, the title bar should disappear, or become less prominent in some way. If I'm using this to share info with friends or collaborators (the best use for a wiki), we want to focus on our content, not the site itself.<p>Nice job.",1341179560

4186273,comment,4183987,4186221,28,0,KirinDave,,,"> I don't even... what do you expect Apple Legal to innovate?<p>Apple Engineering creates great products. Apple Legal pays private security firms and complicit local officials to storm journalist's houses. Apple Engineering is trying to create a reputation as a great place to work, Apple Legal is scaring away engineers left and right. Apple Legal plays dirty, Apple Engineering and Design talk about the nobility of great products.<p>> The tech crowd doesn't get that a local meritocracy where the best phone wins optimizes existing things, like making a better keyboard or improved battery life, but it doesn't often lead to an iPhone or other revolutionary change. A pure merit-based market actually punishes innovation -- if you spend years and a billion dollars researching HCI, form factors, etc and your competitors just copy you then you are competing with a billion dollar hand tied behind your back.<p>I'm not sure how Apple <i>hasn't</i> been rewarded for their efforts. What more, exactly, do they need? They've gone from 0 to a lead in smartphone marketshare, dictating the discussion and product form factors the entire time. The entire industry turns on the axis of Apple's release cycles. Their product, ""iPad"", is practically the ""kleenex"" name of the post-PC era. They have an incredible stockpile of money, goodwill, and clout in their local government.<p>Do they also get to make spurious patent claims left and right now, and expect everyone to take them seriously?<p>> Is this particular patent valid? Maybe, maybe not... it doesn't really matter.<p>I am pretty sure it matters a lot, as there's nearly $100m in bonds being laid out.<p>> What really matters is that unless Apple's competitors need to compete much more effectively in order to make up for their lack of innovation then the market has failed.<p>But they _do_. Please note how many big players in the market have simply been crushed because of their complete inability to adapt to the market forces Apple brought to bear. Nokia? Pif. Blackberry? Swirling down the drain.<p>Android is only where it is because the remainder of the industry banded together and formed some kind of freakish multi-headed alliance which barely works and has taken twice as long to even begin to compete. And it's taken a ton of money and engineering time dumped in by Google to keep the project from imploding.<p>The problem, ultimately, is that the patent system is broken. It should not be possible to patent such obvious variations on interface tropes as ""search as you type... from multiple sources... also on a phone!"" It _should_ be the case that Patent holders get punished for writing broad patents (so that more things qualify as prior art) rather than the current situation where patents receive almost no vetting at all and are seldom challenged.<p>I'm not sure how much advantage Apple should get for being the first mover, but at some point competition will exist. We've had years of Apple sitting on an epic pile of money and not hiring engineers while the entire valley of has been gobbled up by Google, Facebook, and others. If other companies are finally starting to outpace Apple, it's inevitable given Apple's oddball management decisions. These are the same bad management decisionsin my opinion, of coursethat have led Apple to be so very weak when it comes to actually fielding software services. They've had nothing but a string of embarrassments in this field and most people I know in my field are extremely leery about considering employment with Apple in this capacity as a result.<p>Trying to litigate on weak patents and novel definitions of ""irreparable damage (!!!)"" is bad for me, as a consumer. I am yet again disappointed in them, and I am furious at how broken our patent system for software and technical innovation.",1341179484
4186272,comment,4185757,4186079,1,0,drawkbox,,,"Marketing is very important, as important as the product as my last statement mentions. I think the post was incorrectly interpreted.  I was only speaking to when the product stops innovating and everything is solved by more marketing.<p>The meme isn't 'marketing screws companies up' since without marketing or a product there is nothing. It's when the focus goes off the product and into marketing ether (same problem with only making product and doing no marketing).<p>An example might be demoing a product that isn't available for another 6 months to a year. It's a balance but the moment the focus is off delivering product first it is over.<p>The twitter API group verses the marketing group I can bet most of the people in the API camp were developers/product people and the marketers were not.  Where do you want the focus in your company? The product or the marketing?  One usually wins out or takes the reigns, both extremely important.

Patents are the cause of a decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics?<p>I was in Mexico last week and could buy many types of antibiotics over-the-counter without a prescription, and the prices all seemed below what you'd see for comparable generic drugs in the US.  Obviously they're not even interested in medical supervision when distributing antibiotics (and a bunch of other drugs).  My assumption is that they're even less interested in who owns what patent.<p>Drug companies pushing doctors to use their products seems like a drop in the bucket compared with policies that make antibiotics cheaply and easily available without supervision from those trained in medicine.<p>That said, I'm opposed to abusing the patent system by granting longer patents.

You also need to learn far fewer commands, because Powershell follows the Unix philosophy of small tools that do one thing well much more than Bash+Unix tools. For example if you do ""ls"" then you get a table where one of the columns is LastWriteTime. Want to sort by that column? ""ls | sort lastwritetime"". This works without hassle because ls returns a list of objects, and sort sorts a list of objects by a given property, instead of serializing everything to text that would need to be parsed first. I'm sure that Unixes' ls has an option built in to ls to sort by that column, but off the top of my head I have no idea what it is, and many commands that output lists of things do not have that option.<p>You even get autocompletion across commands: if you type ""ls | sort _"" where _ is the cursor, then you get a list of properties that you can sort objects returned by ls by (LastAccessTime, LastWriteTime, Extension, etc).",1341177846

America is being brought low quickly enough.  As we've pretty much thrown away most of the restraints on the Federal Government spelled out in the Constitution, America will be the next century's counter-example of a nation with great resources but little importance on the geopolitical stage as we destroy Liberty and the Free Enterprise system that was the true engine that originally brought America to power.",1341177565

I wouldn't think anything differently of someone wearing these glasses as I would of someone using a mobile phone to take photos or video in a place or at an event.  (And importantly, I would assume the same battery life constraints around video'ing and constantly taking photos would apply to glasses just like they do with phones.)<p>The key difference is that it's very obvious when someone is using their phone to do this, where it's not with glasses.  This could be bad (being video'ed when you don't want to be), but could also be pretty good (taking photos of a fantastic meal at a great restaurant when you don't want to disturb anyone else.)

4186157,comment,4185757,4185757,17,0,cletus,,,"For a year or two I've predicted the ultimate demise of Twitter, which probably means some kind of acquisition. I stand by that prediction. They have hundreds of millions (if not billions) so it's not going to happen overnight but it will happen.<p>What is Twitter? I see it as two things:<p>1. Infrastructure: it is a means of sending thousands of short messages a second to people in asymmetric relationships. Technically this isn't a hard problem. There are many companies around who handle traffic many orders of magnitude above this. The danger with infrastructure is that it will get commoditized. The cost in terms of resources (bandwidth, CPU, power) is not that high;<p>There are parallels between Twitter and SMS. SMS survives and is hugely profitable because of the telco cartel that monopolizes it. Where hosting companies will provide you with bandwidth for cents per GB, SMS costs thousands if not millions of dollars per GB. That too will come to an end eventually. What saves it now is all the players want to push their own standards and they aren't interoperable. It's IM fiefdoms all over again.<p>2. An audience. Twitter and its users have the ability to reach a large number of people. Originally Twitter was envisioned as a means of real-time status updates between normal people. My impression is that this use case is basically dead. The vast majority of Twitter usage seems to be as a communication tool by celebrities. There is a business in that but it isn't the revolutionary communication tool it was once thought (and some still think) it to be.<p>So the camps in question (the API camp and the ad camp) fit into the above.<p>Owning infrastructure can be hugely lucrative (eg SMS). History is full of examples of this. Railroads, oil, telephony, etc. The problem is that you get too big and the government will intervene.<p>Messaging infrastructure is too important for one party to own it. Email is federated and open. The future of messaging is too (I believe) federated and open.<p>So that leaves (2), the ad camp. The problem with advertising on Twitter is the same as it is on Facebook: it's an unwelcome intrusion.<p>Perhaps Twitter could have (and may still be able to) build a display ad business but Twitter is still not a particularly mainstream product (and IMHO it doesn't look like it ever will be).<p>Perhaps Twitter could've had a subreddit/Facebook pages type hubrid model. Upvoting of Tweets is possibly interesting.<p>Of course this faces the same problem Digg had: few things are globally interesting. What's interesting to you is not necessarily interesting to me so you changing what I see is again an intrusion.<p>Basically ""content gateways"" (like Digg, Slashdot, etc) were I believe transitional. I don't believe you'll have a repeat of Digg moderators being paid to promote stories. You can (and people do) pay celebrities to retweet things but that still only goes to their followers. They have to consider their brands and building and keeping their respective audiences too.<p>Those thinking Twitter should have an open firehose (or close to it) are neglecting the reality that Twitter is a business and needs to make money somehow. Open access to their content greatly diminishes that.<p>Lastly, quite a few people will speak of ""betrayed"" by Twitter over API access. They also believe that developers were largely responsible for making Twitter popular. As I said (just yesterday) that this is inevitable. Become too successful and the platform subsumes you into their core offering (no one wants core features controlled by third parties). Developers were I believe largely incidental to Twitter's success. Twitter succeeded (as it were) because people used it. To take credit for that as a developer community is like saying that the automobile succeeded because of car wash stations and autoshops selling rims.<p>EDIT: one last point. It's popular, particularly on HN, to simply build an audience or something that scales without concern for monetization. I certainly understand the logic behind this. Sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't.<p>Twitter hasn't come up with a scalable business model yet because there isn't one. As much as founders can be praised for ""swinging for the fences"" and going all in, sometimes the best outcome is to be acquired because what you've developed isn't a viable independent business but could be an incredibly valuable part of a wider portfolio of products.",1341177184

They also argue that having a single host company that has a head start over others will discourage others from jumping on board.<p>I sincerely hope that such an approach could lead to a real open standard.

To begin with just a gcc -o hello.exe hello.c is all that is needed and as you progress with learning the language the additional params are introduced.<p>As the command line on Windows is extremely simple I have found it easier to teach people how to use the command line than to switch to another browser. They only need to have a basic knowledge half a dozen commands, which can easily be written down, to get started. Also, and sorry if this seems insulting, if someone can't grok the idea of using cd to change a directory (and therefore under what a directory is) they probably are not going to be able to learn to program no matter what the language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/</a>",1341176606

Vanilla Visa was exactly the one I had, that ran into the problem, and I'd even put in my name and ZIP on their web site.<p>The problem seemed to be the lack of a billing address -- what are you supposed to put? Nothing worked. On another site that processed their credit cards via PayPal, it didn't work either. I called PayPal customer service and they explicitly told me they don't support cards that don't provide a means to verify a valid billing address and 3-digit security code.",1341176578

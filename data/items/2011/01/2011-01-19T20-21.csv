I have 2 remarks on the design.<p>1) Not all businesses have a single Zip Code. It is the right idea for a restaurant or bar for example, but only if there is only one location. For example, if I owned a small chain like 16 Handles for example I may be interested in how people like my business in general, not on one store. I can see how the feature could be useful, but it should be optional (and clearly marked so)<p>2) When I tried to click on the screenshots, I thought that the text was way too small to really understand what you were seeing. When I squinted I could figure it out, and it did seem really cool, but I am only 20 and using Chrome on a MacBook Air, so I think you should make the font waaaay bigger for your target middle aged user on a 5 year old Dell using IE7.",1295469560

There's something up with the racket page, so I'm not able to download the mzscheme source just now (via <a href=""http://arclanguage.org/install"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arclanguage.org/install</a>), but that's one thing I've noticed in Python web server implementations. Side-stepping epoll, libevent and all that for a second, there's a tendency to use select (which uses an array of file descriptors; 0 to highest file descriptor) instead of poll (which isn't encumbered the same way).<p>I think in part there is a tendency, among server developers, correctly, to fear anything that looks like a busy wait (e.g., with the name poll). But really poll is just as asynchronous as select in this context (I don't know about FreeBSD's implementation -- but Linux puts to sleep wait queues the same way, afaik). It just doesn't suffer from the crazy indexing scheme of select....<p>At any rate, I didn't get a chance to finish probing the internals of what mzscheme uses. But if there's a way to substitute poll for select, it can often alleviate those issues of 900 requests queue up and you eventually have an fd with a value of 1024 or greater -- even though you may not have 1024 actual concurrent requests....<p>Though others feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. I only comment because I came across a similar issue recently. This link may be useful too:<p><a href=""http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-6-sect-3.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-6-sect-3.shtml</a><p>ETA. i finally got a copy of the most recent racket source (though probably not the one rtm and pg are using). but if anyone is curious, browse racket/src/network.c. the source version for mac uses a bunch of selects (e.g., for tcp-accept). replacing with poll might help.... the max number of FDs per login session is often 1024 by default. so you might want to bump that up if it's not already. and consider using poll.... just an idea.",1295469439

There's the same situation is with parts of ffmpeg/libavformat or libmad - you just can't ship and use them completely legally.

The toy quadcopters control by differential thrust and torque.  For attitude, they control the thrust of the different motors to get a vectored thrust effect.  For orientation, the pairs of motors are spinning in opposite directions, so if you spin a pair faster and a pair slower, the torque imbalance between the CW and CCW spinning motors will spin the quadrotor body.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrotor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrotor</a><p>Autorotation in a helicopter is done by setting the blade pitch negative so that the rotor is driven by the air wooshing up through the rotor.  When you are close to the ground, you pull collective, trading the energy stored in the spinning of the rotor blades for vertical thrust to slow your descent.  If you do it right, you land gently with a much slower rotor speed.  If you do it wrong, you fall the last five feet. :-O<p>(Auto-gyro works like a helicopter auto-rotation.  I suspect auto-gyros typically don't have as much blade pitch control as a helicopter.  As I understand it, it is much safer to land an auto-gyro with forward velocity and a roll-out rather than vertically like a helicopter.)",1295468333

The same APIs are accessible to any other browser. If someone has evidence that Mozilla, et al. have been technically locked out of using the media APIs on Windows or Mac OS X, I'd be interested in the details, and if someone has evidence that they've been locked out of using the media APIs on Linux, I'll eat my hat.<p><i>they use their vendor's decoder and nothing else</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean. If you mean something like ""Windows will only support h.264 and you can't use anything else"", then that is exactly wrong.",1295467440

The company is BuzzLabs, a six-person Seattle startup. We've received strategic seed funding from a large player in the local business space.<p>The goal is to save business owners (think restaurants, hotels, spas) the hassle of checking dozens of sites to find out what people are saying about them online. They want to focus on improving their business instead of surfing the web and figuring out what's relevant and interesting to their business.<p>Our technology aggregates social media activity for a local business (i.e. reviews, tweets, blog posts, etc.) into one place, and supplements that activity with deeper analysis and trends. Behind the scenes, we're doing relevance filtering, scoring, classification, and natural language processing to make the report relevant and meaningful.<p>We've built two separate products on the same technology platform: Find My Buzz (<a href=""http://www.findmybuzz.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.findmybuzz.com</a>), and an interactive dashboard (<a href=""http://www.buzzlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzlabs.com</a>). Find My Buzz
is intended to be a lightweight, stop-and-go version of the dashboard -- simple, less-frequent printed consumption by small business owners. The dashboard is for larger businesses/chains with lots of online activity, where daily, aggregate ""real-time"" brand monitoring is crucial.<p>Any feedback would be appreciated. I can also be reached at [jason at buzzlabs dot com]<p>Thanks in advance,
Jason Tan, CTO",1295467268

""Most professional investors are happy to see Jobs out of Apple,"" said Don Sinsabaugh, a partner in Swergold Chefitz & Sinsabaugh.

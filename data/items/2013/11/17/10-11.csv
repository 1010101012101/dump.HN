In terms of hiring people to code in Ember, it&#x27;s much easier to onboard people once you have a few developers that really know ember through and through. The biggest problem i&#x27;ve found is that for a long time the API&#x27;s changed around a bit (they are fixed now) and that meant that sometimes if you&#x27;re on StackOverflow, the fix may not work anymore.<p>Having used Backbone, Angular and Ember; I would describe Backbone as the past, Angular as the present and Ember as the future.<p>Ember&#x27;s got some pretty big people using it, Zendesk&#x27;s new agent interface is built in it, Discourse, Square and (indirectly) Apple (iCloud uses Sproutcore which is where Ember originated from).",1384685852

I&#x27;d created a Gmail account some years back recognizing that having a pseudonymous identity would be useful to me.  I later created a YouTube account to be able to access the occasional restricted video.  I&#x27;ve occasionally commented on and/or rated videos, but as those actions became increasingly public and accessible, I&#x27;ve periodically purged my content there under that account.  And when G+ started up, having first created an account under my real name, I rapidly decided that I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> want an &quot;identity service&quot;, deleted that G+ profile (elements of it remain but I make very little use of them) and switched to a pseudonymous account as my primary persona on that service.<p>Now Google have, against my wishes, elected to merge the previously independent G+ and YouTube accounts.

The Dashboard presents all of Google&#x27;s services with the ability to opt-in to additional services.<p>So, for example, if I sign up for a GMail account, my dashboard only shows I&#x27;ve activated the GMail service, but also lists all the other Google services such as Google+, Docs, Drive etc. You can use the dashboard to promote your services rather than cluttering the GMail interface with promos for Google+, Google Chat, Hangouts etc. It&#x27;s a bit ironic that one of the stated goals of Gmail is to minimise distractions and yet the GMail interface is stuffed with promos for other Google services.",1384684253

Users are valuable only when they&#x27;re in <i>sellable</i> state. Ad companies don&#x27;t want to buy fully anonymous, bogus or false profiles. They want real personal information from real human. To increase efficiency of target reaching / marketing cost.<p>Until now, Google didn&#x27;t need to worry about quality of their product - I mean their <i>users profiles</i>. Because that was valuable enough. Because nobody else could provided anything better.<p>But now it&#x27;s a little bit different. Especially with Facebook. Facebook provides <i>better product</i> - more accurate, proven, related, real personal information. There&#x27;s mostly no spamming, bogus, false account. They offer interconnected and very clearly tasted profiles. The most fantastic thing is all the informations are input by users themselves. So accuracy of the data is incredible. Google&#x27; product - user profile - is mostly tracked by usage history. So inaccurate. People refuse to input something on Google. This degrades quality of their product.<p>To the marketers, Google product - user profiles - are now inferior. Nobody wants to buy Google product anymore. Not completely useless yet, but it&#x27;s not competitive product to what Facebook provides. If this situation continues, Google has to bargain a lot, and finally will lose the only their profitable business - ad selling. Ad is not just an empty space on a website. Nowadays, you can&#x27;t sell ad in high price without targeting information. Google&#x27;s targeting was best in old days, but now Facebook offers even better which makes Google product crap.<p>That&#x27;s why Google is pushing everybody to their copy of Facebook - G+. To survive. By making money. G+ can make money by delivering quality user profiles to marketers. But you, the users, are just nothing if you don&#x27;t offer that informations.

It provides intrinsics that are translated to a single machine instruction. Normally, you don&#x27;t use the class directly. For example, you use, say, AtomicInt for CAS operations (which, internally uses s.m.Unsaafe) or the ByteBuffer class (which internally uses s.m.Unsafe for direct pointer access). The JDK classes add all sorts of protection (like range checks) around s.m.Unsafe, but if you know what you&#x27;re doing, using s.m.Unsafe directly and eschewing some of those protections (usually adding ones more pertinent to your domain), you get some performance gains which may be significant depending on your use case.",1384683773

I&#x27;ve been railing about this pretty much since G+ started (originally with nymwars) and Google just seems to continue not getting it.  Mega thanks to David for getting this on the queue and everyone who upvoted.  For something which was just a throwaway post (as I said:  I was looking for one of my own earlier instances and stumbled across a whole trove), this had legs.<p>The HN moral:  sometimes your best work is the stuff that takes little effort, thought it helps to hit the Zeitgeist wave just right.<p>I ... don&#x27;t <i>dislike</i> Google, though the company&#x27;s made itself vastly harder to like, and for me personally, its brand equity has been tremendously hurt by my experience to its corporate goals and motives surrounding G+, pretty much from the start.  My history with the company goes back further -- I was using its search during beta in 1998/1999, and the reason was simple:  it made things easier for me, and performed useful tasks, far better than anyone else at the time.<p>For a long time I saw Google bashing as almost entirely a Microsoft phenomenon, but I&#x27;ve got to say that&#x27;s no longer the case.  I&#x27;m absolutely no friend of Redmond&#x27;s, and have watched events there over the past few months with no small amount of schadenfreude.  There&#x27;s no question that Microsoft continues to bash Google (sometimes effectively, often pretty cluelessly).  It&#x27;s very clear to me that there&#x27;s a pretty solid and consistent backlash not just from techies, but as the G+ search I ran made clear, from ordinary people sick of intrusive questions.<p>I could wax on about privacy, and people who could be endangered or put in harm&#x27;s way or find their lives ruined or what if Stalinist Nazi Cthulu buys Google... and all of that&#x27;s entirely valid, but it&#x27;s besides the point.  Even if none of that applies, and you prefer <i>not</i> to have your personal data aggregated, if you say &quot;no&quot;, the meaning is simple:  &quot;no&quot;.  Stop asking.  Don&#x27;t go ahead and do it anyway.  Don&#x27;t put buttons where they&#x27;re likely to get hit accidentally, or confusing dialogs, or interstitials, or anything else.<p>Because it&#x27;s about respect.<p>But even if none of the factors above apply, the simple fact that I&#x27;ve and many, many others have made amply clear that no, we don&#x27;t wish to provide this information, no, we don&#x27;t wish to link our various associated identities, and no, we don&#x27;t want to be part of your &quot;identity network&quot;, means that Google (and, to be fair, a great many other companies and entities) are going OUT OF THEIR WAY TO EXPLICITLY DISRESPECT THAT PREFERENCE.<p>And that Google, very, very clearly, no longer respects me, or any of its users, based on far too many of its actions.  Where Google used to make a decent coin offering incidental ads on top of a useful services, it&#x27;s ... lost its way.<p>The data aggregation is one part of it.  &quot;No&quot; means &quot;No&quot;.  It&#x27;s a really simple message.<p>Somewhat ironically, I&#x27;d recently kicked off a G+ Community (private and invite only, sorry, I&#x27;ve actually transferred ownership to others as well) to discuss an anti-harassment policy following a long and detailed discussion:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/108316670838828910396/posts/9gMF3qyqpbK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/108316670838828910396/posts/9gMF3qyq...</a><p>Google&#x27;s own inability to play by similar rules is ... interesting.<p>I&#x27;d also been reviewing some older posts, mine and other people&#x27;s, as well as many of the YouTube top contributor responses (Reggie, Jonathan Paula, and others).  Three points that kept getting made again and again were:<p>1. Google&#x27;s interfaces make tons of work for users.  It&#x27;s sort of the anti-Perl:  they make easy things hard (and tedious), and hard things impossible.  Responding to YouTube comments, muting or blocking users, flagging spam, setting volume controls, managing Circles, checking on blocked / muted users, and on and on.  In particular the fact that <i>to take care of a problem here and now</i> you&#x27;ve got to <i>go somewhere else within the site to deal with it.</i>  The lack of concurrent controls is ... maddening.<p>2. There was no direct control over things.  Google apparently are trying to handle everything &quot;behind the scenes&quot; through machine intelligence.  And far too often doing an absolutely miserable job of it, especially where some very basic controls (dismiss post, time-out a user, comment moderation tools for posts) would help tremendously.  I&#x27;ve seen some suggestions that earlier iterations (Wave or Buzz) are considered to have failed in part because their interfaces were too complex, but if anything G+ suffers from too <i>few</i> controls.  And one sign of an oversimplified interface is that people start devising conventions to get around limitations.  This happens on G+ in spades.<p>3. Noise controls.  People&#x27;s streams are absolutely out of control.  I&#x27;d noted starting in March or thereabouts that I was finding Notifications and Search far more useful than my Stream.  In a discussion of the +1 automatic share issue, Lauren Weinstein&#x27;s guests similarly noted that they were using their Streams less and less:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/events/c0sddcekptbf047pb3if23rfvjc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/events/c0sddcekptbf047pb3if23rfvjc</a><p>In particular, Robert Scoble (the old noisemaker hisself) has ranted repeatedly and epicly on the lack of proper noise controls on G+, from pretty much day 1.  This is from about a year in, but few of the points have been addressed:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/9mA8XCdu3qA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/9mA8XCdu...</a><p>When I go to a site such as Hacker News or Reddit, I typically <i>look at the front page first</i> to see what&#x27;s been selected.  Because, well, it&#x27;s been selected.  G+ Streams and Communities don&#x27;t do that.  I turn to them, if at all, <i>after</i> going through Notifications or explicitly searching for things.  I recently suggested G+ fix &quot;What&#x27;s Hot&quot; by simply renaming it &quot;What&#x27;s Rot&quot;.<p>Who really nailed it for me though was Homer Slated&#x27;s comment on this issue at G+ (NB: it&#x27;s a touch piquant):<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/102946757503830834230/posts/Mim3MwZTrXc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/102946757503830834230/posts/Mim3MwZT...</a><p>In a comment he writes, that when receiving a Notification from Google:<p><i>[W]hat Google is doing is, essentially, telling me that it&#x27;s found a word in the dictionary that I might be interested in, that it&#x27;s seven letters long and contains the letter &quot;g&quot;, but rather than just telling me what the word is, or even linking directly to it, it simply links me to a dictionary, then expects me to spend hours trawling through that dictionary just to finds that word....</i><p><i>It helps to understand that Google is not a search company, or a social networking outfit, or an email provider ... it&#x27;s an advertising company, and therefore everything it does is oriented toward the principle of &quot;promotion&quot;....</i><p><i>While I have no doubt that Google has highly sophisticated search algorithms working behind the scenes, the results that you and I are actually presented with, and the mechanisms for obtaining those results, are skewed toward &quot;buzz&quot;, not accuracy or relevance.</i><p><i>In other words, if Google were a news organisation, it wouldn&#x27;t be reporting the news, it would be fabricating it, then tailoring that work of fiction to appeal to (what it believes is) your &quot;general&quot; interests.</i><p><i>If there was a single word that could concisely sum up Google, it would be &quot;vague&quot;. Google is deliberately vague, it&#x27;s notifications are vague, the way it handles articles and comments is vague, its search results are vague ... and by no accident. Google is deliberately vague because it wants to steer you away from what&#x27;s actually relevant to you, and what actually interests you, to those things it wants you to become interested in.</i><p>In a G+ post I discussed lies.  The common one is the lie of commission:  I tell you something that&#x27;s not true, a fabrication.  Another, slightly more nuanced, is the lie of <i>omission</i> -- neglecting to inform you of a material fact.  You&#x27;ll find it especially referenced in business contracts, particularly real-estate and M&A concerning adverse conditions.  A third type is what I&#x27;ve called a &quot;lie of diversion&quot;.  It&#x27;s generally not a truth or a non-truth itself, but its purpose is to <i>obscure</i> truth, meaning, and relevance.  It&#x27;s at the heart of much of what&#x27;s wrong (IMO) with &quot;viral media&quot; and messages -- little non-facts floating around in little non-informational nuggets, clogging up your cognitive circuits.  And processing all that non-information <i>takes a lot of effort</i>.<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/5zrCkbzRqrB"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/5zrCkbzR...</a><p>The biggest problem with G+ I was consistently running into was simply the non-relevance of what it was presenting me.  And that&#x27;s a change fundamentally due, I suspect, to its reliance on advertising and the culture this brings.<p>Google thought it could ride the advertising tiger when it opted to go that way early in its career. And for a time it did. But in a long and storied career of riding tigers, I&#x27;ve learned two things: ultimately the tiger is in control, and dismounting is the hardest part.<p>The lack of respect is why I feel that Google&#x27;s corporate culture is fundamentally broken. Whether it&#x27;s a rotten core or a rotten head I don&#x27;t know. I absolutely don&#x27;t question that there are some very well-meaning people working for Google, especially within the engineering staff. Possibly high on the org chart. But enough people, in enough positions of power, and I strongly suspect Larry Page, Eric Schmidt, and Vic Gundotra as being part of that group, either don&#x27;t get it, are actively pursuing personal data aggregation, or, and this actually frightens me more: have been persuaded that it&#x27;s in their best interest to follow this path via a deal they cannot refuse.<p>Frankly, none of those possibilities does much to give me any level of faith in the company. Or in any centrally-organized personal data-gathering effort.",1384683525

6748305,comment,6746659,6748129,1,0,ra,,,"The market price of BTC has grown fairly consistently on the logarithmic scale for a couple of years now. There have been ups and downs, but the majority of the price growth obviously comes from an increase in demand that isn&#x27;t being met by supply. Supply will not increase, but demand might.<p>What would further increase demand?<p>Well the status quo, i.e. BTC breaking new market highs, having crashes and recovering, that&#x27;s news and so increases the public awareness of BTC, and so more people buy.<p>More companies accepting BTC will increase it&#x27;s usefulness (therefor provide some intrinsic value), more startups working to make transacting in BTC easier will also help increase demand.<p>What would decrease demand in a meaningful way?<p>Unfavourable legislative changes. These are mitigated in that they have to happen on a country by country basis, but generally countries follow the leader on matters of new policy or policy related to new technology.<p>At the moment most BTC demand is for speculative hoarding by investors. Most realise that it&#x27;s a gamble where the downside is losing 100% of capital, but the upside is potentially 1000% or more.<p><opinion>There are undoubtedly future market rallys and crashes ahead, but I think in the long run BTC has a long way to go. It&#x27;s very difficult to &quot;price&quot; BTC because it generates no return in it&#x27;s own right, and has no intrinsic commodity value. It&#x27;s a gamble but the potential return seems worth the risk of potentially losing 100% of your capital.</opinion><p>It is important that you regard BTC as speculative - i.e. not an investment.<p>In the end the long term survival of BTC will depend on it&#x27;s adoption. So if you want to make money, horde some BTC and work on a project that makes uses it to solve a real business problem for a meaningful market.",1384682901

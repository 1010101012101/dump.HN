It's about the ability to see what can be removed completely from the code and dried up to give desired result with maximum re-usability.<p>Now I'd credit this to the ""direction of rails"" which served SASS/SCSS or coffeescript as default. It forced me to think and add programming logic into style. Personally, I like it.<p>Also what fails me, is the classic nodejs vs Rails war. Let me re-word this: It is a classic unfounded flame-war, as described in HN guidelines. Both technologies have a place and are useful for even more mutually-exclusive scenarios. Why compare?, just do you own thing!<p>To sum it up - there is a need to take a step back and consider the idea ""you wouldn't bump on something new thing or useful with status quo.""

That is, a person with a given DNA, if raised by caring and educated parent will turn out to be a very different person, with different abilities, talents, and character, than if they were raised by a crack addicted illiterate mom.<p>So, the phrase ""life is what you make of it"" means not, ""life is what your DNA has dictated"" but ""life is what you (as shaped by your DNA, your upbringing, and major events in your life) make of it""<p>> <i>So, ""like if what you make it"" can be better rephrased as: ""life is what you make it, but for a lot of people it takes 10 times the effort other people to make it the same thing, and/or extremely rare lucky breaks"".</i><p>I agree, but the main point of the post was not to focus on the large hurdles that the disadvantaged have in achieving any given goal.<p>The main focus was on the fact that, for people facing a similar set of hurdles, their whole persona (abilities, talents, personality) is a huge determinant of their success, and as a result, the life they can make will be very different, even if they both work equally hard.<p>For example, take two middle-class fresh grads from great schools moving to Silicon Valley to make it. One is a top-notch programmer and great at socializing and is immediately likable when people meet him, while the other is a so-so programmer and not that good at socializing and meeting people. Who do you think will make more connections in Silicon Valley, get better job offers, etc?<p>To summarize, the main point of the post can be captured by the following: ""Life is what you make of it, but for most people, what they <i>can</i> make of it is not much (especially if their sights are too high)""",1330235404

Not sure if that's specific to the state (VA) though and I have to believe it would be shown more if it was PG-13.<p>(incidentally, I'm glad we watched it and I think it was important to give perspective but I can see how some parents might have objected considering the brutality of the subject matter.

But, make an offer.  You can always raise it later, even if they don't respond to the first.<p>I've used some of the domain negotiating services, though only for private domains.  You can always make a direct offer to the private registration companies, if you don't want to go the negotiator route.<p>In my experience, you just have to start the process w/ a serious offer.  You have a pretty good starting point w/ Brad Feld's blog, so a 1-2k offer is as good a place as any to start.<p>On the flip side, start with the highest number that if someone offered to sell you the domain at that price, you'd buy it as a no brainer.\nBest of luck.",1330232717

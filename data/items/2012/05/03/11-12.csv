3923386,comment,3920758,3922889,3,0,klodolph,,,"It's far from a foolproof process.  You have to be careful with choosing paper (RC vs FB is one choice, and RC is much better than it was in the 70's but I wouldn't consider it ""archival"", some FB paper may be acid free but still contains whitening chemicals which caused problems in the past) and the chemicals and washing process has to be done properly (it's easy to get contamination in the wash water, hypo in the final print will cause fading over time).  Then you have to store it properly.  If you frame it, you have to worry about the air in the frame -- there are stories of prints framed during building renovation that degraded since the frame trapped air containing chemicals from the construction.  Tape is also a serious issue if you use tape (which is the best way to frame prints).<p>""Permanent"" is such a strong word.  Sure, 100 years, if you get all of the above right.<p>Getting well past 100 years is simply not within the range of simple silver gelatin prints; the silver will corrode due to the same process that causes silver jewelry to tarnish.  True archival stability requires toning.  You have three good options: sulfide, selenium, or gold.  Sulfide (or ""sepia"") has a striking brown color which reminds you of old photographs.  That's because only the old photographs which were toned survived -- the neutral colored black and white photographs faded long ago.  Selenium has a more mellow black/brown color depending on the dilution, and can be made fairly neutral.  It is generally preferred over sulfide.  Gold, on the other hand, provides a slightly cooler tone (blue or green is possible, if you use enough of it) but it's expensive enough that the cost of the gold can be a significant fraction of the material cost.  (Old gold-toned photos survive too, but they're rarer.)  (Not all toners increase permanence, e.g., iron-based toners can give you a cheaper blue than using gold but they're water-soluble.)<p>On the other hand, an inkjet can be loaded with carbon-based pigments.  Carbon-based pigments can be found on cave paintings in France dating back 32,000 years, so they should be stable enough.<p>I have no doubt that a good inkjet print with carbon-based inks will outlast all of my darkroom prints.  In my mind, color inkjet prints have far surpassed color darkroom prints, but that's not as hard as it sounds.",1336046274

Power just increases the stakes, how the cards get dealt is the important point. As a society we spend a lot of time thinking about who has what power because we know what happens when you get it wrong. But, strangely, we dont afford technology the same consideration. What happens instead is that whichever technology is just the right mix of popular and profitable proliferates while all others die. The implication of this belief is twofold:<p>* there are a whole load of great technologies with no means of generating profit that we will never benefit from<p>* there are a whole load of awful technologies that are profitable that have a negative effect on society that stick around.",1336045883

The rest of the incoming money/profits go in to the company, but you as employee X generally have no say how the company operates.  The profits that should be being funnelled in to XYZ, instead go to ABC, which everyone else can see is a dumb decision, but ... you can't influence it.

This is not saying I'm perfect - of course I'd make some mistakes. But mine would be harder to detect ;)<p>Learning how to translate your value as a developer into dollars is an extremely useful skill that will help you gain a lot of respect and earn more. Speaking from experience, people are a lot more impressed when I say ""I saved my last company $3MM in 8 months"" than if I say something like ""I set up a reporting architecture which allowed us to automate a lot of work and greatly reduce the number of errors, plus create new reports faster.""<p>So how do you actually figure out your value? Here are some methods:<p>1. Time savings. Almost everything a developer does reduces the need for other people to spend time working on any given project. Ask a few people how much time they save per week thanks to your software, and multiply that by the number of people using what you've created.<p>2. Sales increases. Compare companies in the industry that have great development practices to companies that have terrible practices. Find out what features have helped increased sales, and point out how these features couldn't have been created without fantastic developers available. You'll find that a case for hiring good programmers. almost writes itself.<p>3. If you want to get really advanced, take (1) and (2) and actively seek projects where you'll be make major contributions to the company's bottom line.",1336044520

It's harder to find people who can get up to speed on the business specifics quickly, but... it's also easier to augment on an as-needed basis.  It requires companies to be better/faster at documenting their processes/operations, or at least being able to communicate them to a new person faster, and this part people aren't very good at.  Therefore it takes a long time to get contractors up to speed, and therefore it's viewed as excessive, vs. just hiring someone.  Problem is, that hired someone goes through the same process.  It's just that they don't do that as often, so the problem isn't as apparent (or seems 'normal' for employees to have to endure).

In small, not very competitive markets, like the one in Austria, companies are not expecting the programmers they hire to be great; not being very bad would be enough. All they will be asked to do is to support the legacy accounting system -- what's the point of hiring a ninja for that? This, combined with the typical CFO mentality (""That's all the budget I can allocate and I don't care about the position not being filled because it's the IT director who will be affected by that, not me. Frankly, I don't even think that accounting system needs rewriting. When's the lunch?"") drives the offer side down.<p>On the other side, as an ""entry level programmer"", are you absolutely sure you worth more than 2200 EUR? Care to prove it to a Google recruiter, speaking in your native language just across the border, in Munich? Care to prove to the free market that you can run your own business and earn more? Great. That's what we have free markets for.<p>EDIT: Just want to add that I'm all for ""pay well to hire great developers"" approach, but I think this advice mostly applies to companies operating in highly competitive environments: think London startups competing with the salaries paid in the City, or startups in SV trying to lure people away from Facebook.

The bonus is taxed at a lower marginal rate (6%, no social security contribution, IIRC, vs 37.5% lowest marginal rate).<p>* There is no fixed minimum wage in Austria. Instead, there is a collective bargaining system, which sets minimum salaries for each industry. Within each industry there are defined categories of jobs, education and levels of experience, along with minimum employment contract conditions and payment for each. This has some bizarre consequences, such that equivalent jobs (e.g. secretary) have different minimum wages in different industries.<p>* Employers are required to pay a <i>lot</i> of social security/tax on top of what the employees themselves pay. (just checked this: 21.83% social security, communal tax 3%, about 6% other ""social"" contributions according to <a href=""http://www.gruendungswissen.at/gruendungswissen/blog-post/2011/04/06/gruenderlexikon-lohnnebenkosten/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gruendungswissen.at/gruendungswissen/blog-post/20...</a> )<p>* Employees are almost impossible to fire.

It works very well with multiple monitors.<p>But thankfully there's a choice between the two interface modes.

They actually pay more (and funnily, in that case, I know that company and they pay quite well and know to honor the skills of their developers). Kind of sad that recruiters in Austria haven't yet noticed that everybody thinks the minimum payment is not what people are interested in reading on there and confuse it with the actual payment.",1336042845

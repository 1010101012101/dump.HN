Of course you could put something together (I'd especially be curious to see what you could come up with in Prolog) but the go-to solutions in Haskell are binary and cereal, which lack the terse clarity.

Google's <i>entire</i> reason for not supplying LTE is global availability, and yet, one barely used feature on one carrier is apparently what stopped them from shipping it? Oooookay. Verizon and Wallet have <i>nothing</i> to do this with decision. Zero. Verizon doesn't exist outside the US, just so you know.<p>For any Android fanboy to not decry the lack of LTE is hypocritical at best. The wholesale cost difference between a HSDPA part and a LTE part is negligible at best. There's zero downside to providing a LTE part because it's also a superset of 3G/HSDPA/etc.<p>There's maybe a technical reason for not including it, and instead of the BS justification that Google are trying to sell us, I'd love to hear it. It'd be far more believable than the current ""you don't really need it"" reasoning being thrown about.<p>So yes, you're delusional.

4715946,comment,4715823,4715823,30,0,mediocregopher,,,"I have used erlang in a number of large projects over the last couple years and for the most part I'm in agreement with the author about both the benefits and drawbacks of erlang (when people ask me about erlang I always say ""erlang is great for anything that requires a lot of moving pieces and doesn't require the code to actually look nice or be readable""). I have a couple of other drawbacks I think should probably get mentioned:<p>Logging is..... strange. The recommendation is to use SASL, which writes your logs in a binary format that only another erlang library can properly read. SASL has some nice features, like auto-rotation and such, but I'd much rather have my logs get spit out in plaintext and just logrotate like I do with everything else. One of these days I'm going to write a proper erlang logger.<p>Rebar is strange. It's erlang's deployment tool thing, kind of like leinengen but much less intuitive. I tried getting used to it but found it just made testing more difficult and made setup a chore. I opted instead to just steal the makefiles from the mochiweb project and call it a day.<p>Records have easily the most annoying syntax of any language construct I've ever used. And god forbid you want nested records, have fun with your full solid line of selection syntax. Bleh.<p>Which isn't to say it's all bad, here's some other awesome things about erlang that I don't see pointed out often:<p>Polymorphic anonymous functions<p>The pattern matching is amazing. When I go back to other languages that claim to support pattern matching it feels like I've lost both your feet and replaced them with suction cups. There's no pattern matching like erlang pattern matching.<p>Hot-swapping of code. Somewhat unintuitive, and has weird behavior in certain cases, but still definitely better then restarting the server that thousands of clients have long-running connections on<p>Records. Their syntax is horrible, but their usefulness is infinite. They're basically just syntactic sugar on top of tuples that make them easier to manage and extend.<p>There's more for both sides, but I'll leave it at that. It's a great language, I highly recommend everyone take a stab at it. Even if you hate the syntax it's good exposure to thinking about how to code concurrently.",1351569129

I use it every day to organize my day (with dozens of meetings and reminders) and it works perfectly fine.<p>I can kind of see your point with iOS6 Maps.  But only to a point.  Yes, it did start out really badly.  I reported 3 issues that got fixed the next day (literally).  One of those issues was also on Google Maps and is still broken there.  Since then I haven't seen any problems with quality of data.  I do miss Street View, but day to day, the app is fine.<p>Speaking of maps, when Tim Cook wrote the maps apology letter, he mentioned the Waze application.  I've never heard of it till that day and, man, what a great app.  Whenever I find myself in a traffic situation, I always fire it up.

4715935,comment,4714773,4715609,7,0,sedev,,,"All right, let's go into specifics here.<p>I strongly disagree with your description of the objectionable comment:<p>* First, saying that it is ""non-offensive"" to compare someone to Stalin's regime (or more generally to the Soviet regimes) is so blatantly inaccurate that it's difficult to believe that you seriously advanced that claim. Let's set aside ""offensive"" and say merely that comparing someone to Stalin is in virtually all contexts likely to be inflammatory, perceived as aggressive and hostile, and very likely to derail the discussion. It is not innocuous. So the original claim, with its comparison to Stalin, is immediately suspect because the author has chosen a way to express their disagreement that leads the conversation away from substance.<p>* When you say it ""draws an analogy between two organizations which used propaganda effectively"" you elide important points of information. For one, the nature of any comparison to Stalin. For another, the comment did not, I would say, ""draw an analogy,"" it <i>proposed</i> one - and then took it for granted that the analogy was sound and useful. It presented no evidence for this point, it just stated its view as a _fait accompli._ That is not a good way to make an argument. When you advance a position, you're also obliged to advance evidence for it if you want it to be taken seriously. Humor is no defense here: the commenter was using sarcastic humor to advance an argument, and is not excused from the requirement of presenting evidence for the argument.<p>* On your own part, when you say ""Comparing Mr. Gruber's writings to those of fellow travelers..."" you too are assuming facts not in evidence. Do you mean that Mr. Gruber is a Stalinist? Then please advance the evidence in favor of that, or abandon your argument. You are obliged to present your arguments and their evidence forthrightly, not to wink knowingly and wave in the general direction of something faintly evidence-like.<p>* That the comment ""places the article within a larger historical context"" is so low a standard as to be useless. Any comment here that referred to events outside of 2012 could be said to do as much. Even if the above critiques did not hold, saying that the comment added ""historical context"" would be too glib, would not be a substantial point in its favor. If the comment were presenting evidence for its views, that would be one thing, but to say that the comment as it stands adds ""historical context"" is to say nothing, because by that standard you could defend the legions of facile ""Apple would never have done X while Steve Jobs was alive"" comments.<p>* The comment advanced, more or less, the argument ""Apple's press releases are a form of propaganda; their terseness requires us all to make inferences and guesses about goings-on inside the company that do not serve our understanding well."" This is a mere <i>argument</i> - which is a good thing! It is something that we can have a discussion about, reason about, and it is capable of being falsified. For that matter, if the comment had had what I just said appended to its original content, then all would have been forgiven. But instead we got only the version of the comment that flatters the prejudices of people who are already convinced that Apple is a bunch of no-goodniks and which has nothing useful to say to people who are not already convinced of its argument.<p>In summary, I objected to the comment because it advanced its argument by a method that was obviously likely to drag the discussion in unproductive directions, because it advanced its argument without presenting any evidence, and because it was advancing by insult an argument that could have been advanced without the insult just as productively. I disagree with your defense of it because you are neither holding it to a high standard of argument nor addressing any of its flaws - flaws which are obvious enough that my listing them is barely necessary.<p>Now, since you spoke up to defend it, you have heard its measure. It didn't add anything to the discussion, and the comparison it made was not helpful to anyone's understanding of the situation. I'm willing to put effort into explaining exactly why I think that because I think that a high standard for discussions here is important and necessary, and that letting comments like the one I object to slide by without expressing that they do not meet those standards, is part of maintaining that standard of discussion. Silence on community standards serves no one well. When objectionable comments are met with vigorous resistance, it not only shows the people making them ""no, that kind of comment is not welcome,"" it affirms the community standards by setting them out explicitly and bringing them to everyone's mind. This is why I'm willing to write this much telling you and the author of the objectionable comment why I object. It is not about my <i>disagreeing.</i> Disagreement is a normal part of discourse - but there is no productive disagreement to be had unless people make their arguments plainly, make them falsifiable, and make them by going from evidence to conclusion.",1351568952

There are many reasons for which I would absolutely use it---soft realtime being key---but it is an absolute bear to work with.<p>Erlang's reliance on spawning processes as a central abstraction conceit leads to conflating a lot of best practice OTP ceremony with your domain logic. You end up with a Service Oriented Architecture at the application level---people rarely write pure libraries, but instead bootable applications that you communicate to handle needs asynchronously. Additionally, launching processes is not as simple an interaction as beginner Erlang tutorials have you believe. Instead, there's a lot of reason to wrap in the OTP boilerplate leading you to split out things into multiple files and applications.<p>Dialyzer/Typer is a mess. They're crucial tools for using Erlang successfully, I believe, but they're also only mildly tied into the language and have weird, difficult to understand error messages. That said, they're really good at discovering the myriad errors you'll make passing tuples around.<p>There's also an enormous amount of black magic surrounding rel creation and management. Using Rebar and reverse engineering Riak I was able to figure (most of) it out. It is, as the author states, a very smart system, but it's also very difficult to get all the pieces firing together.<p>I would today use Erlang for creating simple, bombproof server architecture. It's a joy for doing lots of independent, network things in parallel. Mochi Media seems to be an obvious example, and I remember reading that [forgotten game name that isn't ROTMG, thanks!] is an MMO game which models every interacting player as an independent Erlang process. Those examples are both beautiful, as an infrastructure language I think it's unparalleled and begets great technology like Riak---I'm seriously itching to use Riak Core sometime. I just wouldn't want to be the guy who wrote the player logic to run one of those processes.<p>(Edit: to qualify, a lot of these flaws are more my own than Erlang's, but despite spending 3-4 months with it I put it in the box with C as a Right Knife for the Job kind of language)",1351568513

Failure to do so was probably the last straw for his remaining in an active role at Apple (a role he clearly was at least contemplating leaving after his big stock sale).",1351567530

The big stores mainly had cookers and other white goods/appliances, with really limited selection of anything tech.  This was 2000-2002.

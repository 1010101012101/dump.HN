2863676,comment,2863544,2863622,5,0,shawndumas,,,"Way OT but you are making a categorical error: (putting aside what you may or may not think about Christianity but) Christianity asserts that the only reason people (or beings) are <i>not</i> going to heaven is because of <i>their</i> sin (defined as, any want of conformity to or transgression of the law of God). To presuppose that any theoretical aliens have sin is wholly unwarranted. There is no need for any Christian to assume any status as regards heaven in relation to an alien.<p>Also; the existence or lack of existence of any alien life form would have no theological bearing on the western church. (Thats not to say that it would in the east. I just am ignorant of the details -- though if I was a betting man I would say that it is the same in that case also.) Wouldnt change a thing; and not because it would get swept under the carpet but because it really changes nothing core to the dogma deemed necessary for the western church (i.e. the Ecumenical creeds).<p>And, just as an even further aside, some prominent Christian theologians believe that aliens <i>might</i> exist.",1312891162

2863672,comment,2861256,2861711,3,0,tybris,,,"I don't recognize your description of the political landscape. Republicans don't do any more to shrink government than Democrats do to expand it. This has never been true. They do have different priorities. Republicans think the government should be like your father who protects good citizens from harm by fighting bad citizens and foreign threats. Democrats think the government should be like  your mother who nurtures and cares for all of its citizens.<p>As science and economics are showing us a mixture of father and mother turns out to work best, the political differences between Republicans and Democrats are shrinking every year. As a consequence, the parties feel it is necessary to distantiate themselves more and especially the Republicans have spent several decades creating a vast narrative around where their priorities lie. Unfortunately, this has led to big changes in voter's habbits and ideological perspectives.<p>Wealthy opportunists have helped promote and taken advantage of the narrative to push an agenda of lower taxes for the rich in return for lavish campaign funding. A group of people bought into the narrative too deeply and now think that the myths about taxes they heared over the years are the hard facts, and that Democrats have misguided beliefs. Supported by the wealthy opportunists, these people have taken control of the Republican party and its policies. This is a corruption that has taken many years to develop, but now runs deeply into the belief systems of voters and the wallets of politicians.",1312891047

The alternative is to have a if-else instead, and that hurts readability even if you don't usually have much code inside a for-loop. You could probably also solve it by writing a filter function that generates a new list with those you want to process, but I find having lots of ""magic"" functions scattered around the code to be just as annoying.

2863603,comment,2862566,2862566,17,0,nirvana,,,"I'm sure Amazon will fix this issue, but the question it brings to my mind is- why are so many people using ECC?  Most startups need hosting, not an elastic compute cloud.  ECC makes sense for someone who needs to spin up 1,000 workers, pull data out of S3, process it, store the results in S3 and then spin down the workers when it is done.<p>But startups need hosts that are up 24/7. ECC doesn't give you any guarantee of uptime, and if it goes down the local (fast) disk is ephemeral.  Yet, the EBS alternative which is backed up, is very slow.<p>The basic VPS offerings, that Linode, Rackspace, and just about everyone else offers, isn't available at all from Amazon (near as I can see.)  Yet this is what startups need- local disks, a small monthly fee, and up all the time.<p>So, Amazon requires extra engineering--to account for nodes going down more often and to make ephemeral disks reliable or EBS performant.  It also puts you on the path to lock-in, since so many of amazons services have their own unique APIs.  It isn't exactly cheap, near as I can tell, when compared to, say, dedicated hosting in germany.<p>Its advantages exist elsewhere- if you need to spin up a bunch of machines with an API you can do this at rackspace cloud.  And... that's about the only advantage I'm able to think of.  Personally, I'm architecting to have some overcapacity built in and to survive a spike, because I use that excess capacity in the off hours for heavy lifting.   I wouldn't try to bring up extra nodes in the morning and shut them down in the evening anyway... and I doubt that many startups are really doing that.<p>Possibly, I'm missing something.  I tend to forget about features that aren't compelling to me, but are compelling to others.  So maybe there's something that's important to these startups.",1312888746

Since then, I've been through a few different stations, done a few different jobs and I've been at my current place producing radio and online content and presenting shows since the winter of 2009, when it launched. For a variety of recessionary and other reasons, this employment is starting to come to a close.<p>This isn't going to turn into a rant about life in local radio, what's done is done, but suffice to say that being paid below minimum wage, ""volunteering"" for half my hours to keep my job and feeling like I'm instantly disposable just isn't doing it for me anymore.<p>As it's unlikely that I'll find work in radio again with the way the market is, I'm looking for a change of direction. In the past year or so, my work with my current employer has ""evolved"" from just making radio content, to running the station's website in its entirety, producing bespoke web content, repurposing our radio output for web use, and building an online community around the radio station using both our own website and external social networks, maintaining the Linux boxes we're using as office workstations now. I like to think I've succeeded - and I'm finding THAT side of things more fulfilling and enjoyable than pulling up the fader and playing JLS (""she makes me wanna, whoa oh oh.."" etc..) for the fifth time this week.<p>So what do you think I should do, HN? I'm genuinely excited about the fascinating work that's being done by CS types, startups, innovators, hackers, but I'm really unsure where to start. I'm guessing I'd have to go back to college at some point (who gets even an internship in this field without a college degree?) and I'll have to learn to code something a bit more useful than just hacking WordPress into something vaguely suitable for a radio station. Without blowing my own trumpet, I think I'd fit in great in a startup or other organisation helping old media, or community media businesses engage with their communities online and build a sustainable future in the digital world. I'm an intelligent, smart person who just backed the wrong team as a teenager (journalism? radio? What WAS I thinking?) and I'm looking to build a better life for myself.<p>If it's not too much trouble on people - I know everyone is pressured for time these days, not least me - I'd love to connect and get in touch with some people who I could have a chat with about the best way forward. It'd be especially cool if I could find someone else who's taken the same path as I'm planning on taking, out of old media and into the digital world. I live in the North West of England, if that is useful info to anyone.<p>tl;dr: Work in ""old media"", no college degree but some good years of experience in local radio and community media, looking for advice on securing my future sustainably.<p>In the event you want to contact me for any reason, I'm here on HN or voiceonastickhn@gmail.",1312887820

And we did. We invented insipid modal UIs that jerked users around the app. We invented gigantic toolbars with hundreds of vague icons because we were too lazy figure out how to let users access their most used functions quickly. We created unforgiving apps where just <i>glancing</i> at it wrong resulted in data loss. We abdicated our responsibility to make features accessible, and instead printed large manuals and tear-out cheat-sheets, and made fun of people who couldn't handle the information overload.<p>That era's long gone. Look at the App Store - it's a parade of failed apps eviscerated by users for bad UI. It's a gallery of obscure apps that never made it out of the gate because they didn't put thought into their UX. Now look at any of the top apps (in whatever way you define it: top grossing, most downloaded, highest reviewed, whatever), and you will see that one main common thread that connects is that their UI <i>doesn't suck</i>.<p>People's tolerance for bad UI has decreased rapidly for years, continues to decrease, and the number of places where you can get away with it is rapidly shrinking. On the desktop you might still have that much breathing room - on the hyper-competitive winner-takes-all arena of the App Store, you have no chance.<p>As a side note - I highly doubt Qt will save a developer enough time to make the difference between a $1 app price vs. a $5 app price. There are so many low-level fundamental UX differences between iOS, Android, and any of the other mobile platforms that full abstraction is simply not possible in the way that we have been able to do on the desktop.",1312887793

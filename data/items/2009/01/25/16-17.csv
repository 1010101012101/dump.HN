But our questions, the majority of them, are answered with facts.<p>A better test of computer intelligence would be to build a computer that could /ask/ questions. In fact, the more questions a computer can ask in a conversation the smarter it is.<p>Intelligence isn't so much about what we know, but about what we know we /don't/ know. At some point in your evolution as an individual, the amount you know will surpass most of those around you. You'll find that your questions go mostly unanswered. If they are smart, people will simply respond to your questions with, ""I don't know, that's a good question.""  If they are not smart, they'll answer them with the wrong answer.  You'll know it's wrong because you already thought of that...<p>An AI that can take a person to the edge of their knowledge, or that can take /many/ people to the edge of their knowledge, their personal knowledge, is what we are after.<p>However, an AI like this will never pass the Turing test because people will know it's too smart to be human.  Instead, for the AI to pass the test, it'll have to, like the LOLBOT, dumb itself down to the point that a human will not be confused.<p>It's this ability for the AI to consciously ""trick"" humans that is important for passing the Turing test.  Don't be too smart, but don't be too dumb.  Just be smart enough to ask questions, but not too many questions.<p>I read an article a while back about a computer that simply repeated everything the human said back to them, but as a question.  This computer convinced many participants into believing it was real.<p>At one point in the experiment, the article mentioned a particular participant that when approached by one of the researchers replied to the order of, ""Go away, this is a private conversation!""",1232902597

449243,comment,448455,448835,0,0,martin,,,"Right. It has nothing to do with a company not bothering to go to some discount code site -- the point is that a large enterprise has different needs from some guy buying a computer to put in his den.<p>There's a reason Dell has different product lines for consumers and businesses, and that businesses buy the latter despite the higher price. To sell consumer PCs so cheaply, Dell has to use the cheapest hardware available at the time of manufacture. (Also, they have to agree to install various crapware from EarthLink and AOL and Real Networks, but that's another story.) This means that the hardware used in the consumer products changes frequently, and that it's not necessarily the highest quality or of the best-known brand. The business lines, like OptiPlex, have longer lifecycles and use more reputable, name-brand components.<p>For a consumer, price is the most important factor, so the home product is fine. But in an enterprise, those savings would be quickly wiped out by administrative overhead and perhaps worse reliability. A decent IT department tests new software on every hardware/OS configuration on which it will be used prior to deployment, and they'll have a standardized desktop build process based on a cloning product (e.g. Ghost), Remote Installation Service, or something similar. Good luck doing those things if you have 287 different hardware configurations in your environment, or if your computers have some off-brand NIC that doesn't support PXE booting, etc.",1232902403

For two it would be stupid -- it is highly probable that precisely none of you are in my market.<p>I am, typically, neither rude nor stupid.<p>I am also typically surrounded by people who care very little about startups, software, and the like.  So when I'm around other people who care about software, startups, and the like, I tend to mention our point of commonality a bit.   The one I bring up most often is my own because a) I'm intimately acquainted with it and b) unlike my day job, I can talk about it without getting fired if I say too much.<p>But I try to be a good citizen here.  You may feel that I mention my software in almost every post.  Memory plays funny tricks with us.  I don't trust mine with anything important, so I checked with the indispensable external memory of searchyc.com, and it turns out that I've mentioned it about 18 times in the last 255 comments, which is about 7% or so.  (Throw another 6 on the tally for other people referring to my software, if you care to.)  Now I might be counting wrong, as I suck at it almost as bad as I do at remembering things, but I don't suck quite so badly that 7% is ""almost every post"".<p>(Sidenote: this is my 256th comment?  There should be a geekiversary for that.)<p>Now I do try to keep my contributions to the community worth having me here.  If you are to believe the last ~1800 ish times people pushed the ""More comments like this one please!"" button, I like to think I'm doing a halfway decent job.  But I'll try to recalibrate due to your feedback.<p>Say, what would it take to get you behind the controls of your very own gliding duck?",1232900384

The subterranean insects probably know nothing at all about the above ground insects feeding on the leaves.<p>Thinking about it evolutionarily in two ways\n1) plants into which the subterranean insects unknowingly inject their distasteful chemicals live longer because above ground insects do not eat them to death, thus the subterranean insects live longer and propagate more.<p>2) in A Walk In the Woods, I read about trees that when chewed upon by an outside force, will produce a chemical that will drive the predator away.  They can even send signals to other trees.  This same chemical may be the one that fends off the above ground predators, but the subterranean ones are immune.<p>Anyway, there are many explanations for this phenomenon that do not include the conscious ""use"" of the plant to communicate with other animals of other species.<p>The article is misleading at best.  using a telephone is a process which implies that the caller believes to some degree that someone else will answer the phone and a conversation can be had.<p>There's nothing of that sort going on here...",1232899773

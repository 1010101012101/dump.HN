For example, if your laptop gets malware and they steal your corporate banking password and transfer out your money, you could be on the hook for it depending on how your agreement with the bank is written.<p>3) I don&#x27;t see any reason to keep more cash in the high traffic account than is needed to clear the checks coming out of it.<p>4) Have a clearly defined policy on who can transfer how much and to whom. Do not depend on this policy to save you if more is taken than is authorized, but it might help in court.<p>5) Treasuries, sure. CDs? I&#x27;d want a Board resolution authorizing it, and again keep it under the FDIC limit. I think the biggest risk factor comes down to liquidity. Of course, slightly illiquid funds are also <i>perhaps</i> harder to steal?<p>[1] - <a href=""http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/hospital-sues-bank-of-america-over-million-dollar-cyberheist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/03/hospital-sues-bank-of-ame...</a>",1428040726

We get our pricing data from listings for bikes, but without ever seeing the bikes it&#x27;s hard to come up with a way to infer quality that will lead to more consistent pricing.<p>The fact that sellers shade the quality of their bikes isn&#x27;t the only problem (although it&#x27;s a significant one), a lot of times they don&#x27;t even know the quality of the bike they have, whether the derailleur is close to failing, for example. In a way, it&#x27;s worse than the auto market, because with the auto market the price has been enough to justify the creation of services to certify the quality of used cars. I think you could probably ask for an inspection from a bike shop on the quality of the bike, judging the shop based on the Yelp reviews or how trustworthy they are considered in your particular community, though (many people trade bikes in online enthusiast forums, in the same way that cars are).

I think people concentrate too much on learning the specifics of frameworks, and forget about the underlying ideas behind the frameworks itself.<p>I do think, though, that he wrongly blames frameworks for the bad code people usually write. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re writing homegrown code, you still have to write a framework of some sort around it in order to get any work done. I think that the front end frameworks currently available out there all are really bad solutions for what they purport to solve.<p>It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re promised a cutter that cuts cubes, when you need your cube to fit a hole in a shape of a circle. Even after you&#x27;re done using the cutter, you still need to cut around the edges to make it fit, and in doing so, you probably could&#x27;ve just skipped the first step in the first place.<p>Instead of blaming the tool, the blame should be placed in the abstraction. To keep with the analogy, if I had been handed a circle cutter, I could probably fit my shape in the hole with no problem. Better yet, if I was able to choose between a square or a circle cutter before I start a job, that&#x27;d be perfect.<p>As it currently stands, Backbone did a great job at separating the concerns of a web app, but its rendering methods resort to too much thrashing of the dom. Angular attempted to solve the thrashing, but, along its way, it ended up lowering the divide between logic and presentation via its assortment of ng attributes. I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I have high hopes for React and its solutions.<p>The hallmark of a great framework is one which clearly defines what its one task will be and executes it beautifully, and simply. Allowing newcomers to start from the top, and work their way to the bottom without much effort. Since none of the javascript frameworks out there are of high quality at this point, most of the code written in those frameworks will just not be very good, and it&#x27;s ok for right now. That&#x27;s the learning process that the industry goes through every time a new technology is introduced, and I have high hopes that sometime in the next couple of years a framework will come out that will set the tone for the years going forward.",1428037255

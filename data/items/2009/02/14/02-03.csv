I disabled all the unnecessary addons, but still it takes a long time to start FF, it eats memory and works slow with js.<p>I can't switch, because it would be more inconvenient to use Opera than getting used to slowness of FF. So I hope this is going to be fixed in future.",1234580017

But, you don't have infinite money to spend, so there's a good chance you'll go broke before you win (depending on the variance). Another way of looking at it, it's a random walk with a bottom barrier --- once it hits zero, you're out of the game.",1234579885

480773,comment,480118,480275,0,0,jerf,,,"""You can't do that with electronics."" - <i>yet</i>. Electronics have come in hard, bulky cases simply because they have to anyhow. Shrinking them a little bit still means you have a hard, bulky case.<p>But we're within spitting distance of being able to build something like the Kindle as a flexible, waterproof thing thicker than paper, but not too much thicker than paper, with a single bit of bulky electronics attached to the bottom for the battery. Not sure it'll ever work as a broadsheet, which wasn't really chosen for <i>your</i> convenience, but a nice 8x11 or A4 sheet of paper, sure.<p>Now, when I say ""spitting distance"", I still mean ""5 to 10 years"". But it no longer requires fundamental breakthroughs, just feasible advances.<p>(Also, don't read my specs too literally. We'll have to play with the design space before we work the optimal design out, but ""something I can read over coffee"" will definitely be a niche.)",1234579168

Its takes a url and gets you a snapshot of it within 10-20 seconds. We're working on the API part which is almost done. Its a free service and with the API you can actually create services based on web-snapping, for eg. something like http://www.cssdrive.com/ could be made very easily with our service. You design the page, we provide you the snapshot functionality.<p>Now, the problem is, we're out of ideas for any cool names for this service... any good suggestions ?",1234577919

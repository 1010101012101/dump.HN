Techdirt noted additionally that Schmidt&#x27;s statement is painfully similar to the tired adage of pro-surveillance advocates that incorrectly presume that privacy&#x27;s only function is to obscure lawbreaking: &quot;If you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong, you&#x27;ve got nothing to worry about.&quot;",1383562788

6667914,comment,6666050,6667837,0,0,bad_user,,,"Yes, but you are oversimplifying it.<p>We eat mostly the same food recipes, but there is a lot of variation in how that food tastes, depending on who makes it, not to mention the mistakes happening in the preparation process. That&#x27;s also why you can&#x27;t find in a restaurant the familiar taste of the home-cooked meals that your mom or grandma used to cook while you were a child. Can you automate a fast-food chain, like a McDonalds? Of course, but that&#x27;s not food.<p>Plus, one of the reasons for why many of us like to try out restaurants is to get some variety and even though the database of all known food recipes is limited, the combinations possible for sweetness, sourness, saltiness, bitterness, and umami, as received by our tastes buds in various proportions is infinite. Therefore even though we have plenty of food recipes already, there&#x27;s always room for <i>more</i>.<p>Your impression that movie plots can be generated with random combinations stems from the recent wave of Hollywood movies filled with special effects and dumb plots. I personally like movies with special effects and dumb plots. It&#x27;s mindless fun. But sooner or later I&#x27;ll get tired of it, as will many people. Comedy and drama on the other hand need originality and while you can find traces of inspiration everywhere, every successful book or movie ever made also have original pieces in them.<p>You&#x27;re also oversimplifying the technical challenges, as if random combinations of available plots is easy. It&#x27;s not. This is not like playing chess. For this to work you need (1) a way to generate something coherent, because as much fun as it is to generate gibberish with Markov chains, the step from here to generating something meaningful is quite big and (2) a way to measure the <i>fitness</i> of a combination and drop the combinations that don&#x27;t work. What are you going to do? Expose people posing as lab-rats to millions of combinations and measure their brain activity?<p>(yes, I&#x27;m the type of engineer that rains on people&#x27;s dreams, by thinking of the technical challenges involved :-P)",1383562616

Everything with multiple outcomes or things that map well to descriptions trough constraints are very easy in prolog. Conceptually, it is well removed from other languages and therefore worthwhile learning. Prolog naturally teaches you interesting approaches to work with data. Writing parts of my software in Prolog is still an option for me.<p>Practically, though, it suffers from real world problems: there are quite a few of runtime systems, dropping in and out of maintenance every once in a while. Lots of things are semi-standard, for example each runtime ships with a constraint library with different behavior. (e.g. in one Prolog, applying a constraint to a variable that already has a value is an error, in others, it is allowed if the variable satisfies the constraint). Prolog is really more a family of languages, sharing a similar syntax.",1383560063

6667781,comment,6662603,6665353,2,0,giovannibajo1,,,"From a purely FOSS POV, Google never tried to build a community around Android. They develop it privately, and code-drop it when there is a release. Not even their partners (generally) get to see it before the public release. Without a public roadmap, the only kind of significant user contribution to the project is bugfixes (which are still welcome of course).<p>But notice that the problem is not &quot;the rate of free updates&quot;, but rather the fact that Google is moving more and more development into the closed-source part of the operating system, while still trying to maintain the market line that the &quot;operating system is free&quot;. But \n<i>which</i> operating system is free? If you install AOSP on your phone (assuming you can and manage to go through the hurdles) you end up with a phone which is completely different from stock Android. That is my complaint: the difference between AOSP and the so-called &quot;pure Android experience&quot; (as on a Nexus) is widening more and more.<p>You say Android is available for free to &quot;competitors&quot;. But as a matter of fact, AOSP (not Android) is available to competitors, and only those that are not part of the OHA. If you are a member of the OHA (so if you are an Android vendor of any significance), your contract says that you cannot fork Android; not only that, but you cannot even produce/manufacture a forked Android device as a supplier for an unrelated company outside the OHA (which is why Amazon has problems producing Kindle Fires, since all major manufacturers are also trying to sell consumer devices based on Android).<p>Moreover, if you fork AOSP, not only you don&#x27;t have access to the Play Store, but many (most?) .apk won&#x27;t even work on your device, since they rely on the proprietary Google APIs which are not part of AOSP. And this, again, is a widening ongoing process, so more and more (rather than less and less) existing .apk found on Play Store are incompatible with AOSP.<p>I think the way Google cleverly designed the whole &quot;AOSP vs Android&quot; licensing is way more than a standard freemium model; it&#x27;s a model in which nobody pays, a part is open-source, and still it&#x27;s close to impossible to create a forked consumer device that uses AOSP and benefits from the existing ecosystem.<p>The markets in which AOSP is really making a different (in my experience) is the B2B embedded device market, which is not in direct competition with Android devices, and where AOSP is quickly moving to become the de-facto Linux embedded distro. I work in that field, and I&#x27;m grateful to Google for AOSP, as it&#x27;s really making the whole market progress faster than ever.",1383559559

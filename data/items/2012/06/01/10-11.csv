This is responsible for maybe 1% of the author's problems, but the author writes as if it's the main issue.<p>Second, the fact that the LaTeX ecosystem includes things like kpathsea built out of C, bash scripts, and baling wire. This is certainly a real problem for any porting effort.<p>Third, the fact that LaTeX itself equals the TeX engine plus lots (lots and lots and lots) of other bits written <i>in TeX</i>. TeX is not only a typesetter, it's a (horrible, horrible) programming language, and LaTeX is built out of lots of packages implemented on top of that. <i>This</i> is what makes LaTeX slow; it has nothing whatever to do with Pascal or WEB or even bash scripts.<p>Rewriting the WEB stuff in modern C (or CWEB, if the people concerned wanted to preserve the literate-programming approach) might help with portability. It would do nothing to help with speed. In fact, rewriting the old Knuth code would probably make the system slower -- there are things not to like about Knuth's coding style, for sure, but no one would accuse him of not being sufficiently concerned with efficiency or of not being able to write efficient code. What it would take to make LaTeX much faster is not a from-scratch <i>rewrite</i> of the codebase the author complains about, but a from-scratch <i>redesign</i> to enable much more of the work to be done in native code instead of in packages implemented in a nasty macro-expansion language, and to make the extension language nicer and more efficient. (Most likely, by replacing it with Python or Lua or something; see <a href=""http://www.luatex.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.luatex.org/</a> for an attempt to do something rather like that.) Plus a <i>monstrously large</i> project to re-implement all the packages that make LaTeX what it is on that new substrate.",1338546554

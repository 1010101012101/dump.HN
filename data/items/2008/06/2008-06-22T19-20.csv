In almost any other kind of work, they'd be a net loss. But they're also too young to be left unsupervised. Someone has to watch over them, and the most efficient way to do this is to collect them together in one place. Then a few adults can watch all of them."" -- [<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html</a>]",1214164417

Among their cons: their rates are quite high unless you pre-pay for 1M messages a month and they don't want to provide you with a complete list of rates associated to mobile phone (DEF) prefixes, so reselling SMSes is close to impossible, cause you have no means to know how to account your own users in real time :-(.<p>As for selling content over SMS, as far as I know there's no way for a small startup company to get into revenue sharing deals with mobile carriers, besides there are a lot many of them. Yet, there are some companies that provide paid content distribution service, which you can use to resell your mobile service, software or other content you have right for (some junk like ring-tones, pron, etc). They act as a proxy service and they take up to 70% of revenue. They usually have a small coverage of mobile carriers they work with. Also there is a very high rate of returns/chargebacks, as end-user is always right even if he completely abused your service or software :-(. We wanted to use such service to let our customers recharge their balances in our system with a single SMS sent. After I studied this subject (for Europe, have no ideas about US) we abandoned the idea as completely profitless. If you find out anything with better conditions, please let me know.",1214162858

In academia, sadly, this doesn't seem to happen below the PhD level.*<p>That isn't quite true. You're describing much of my high school math and physics education: I had teachers, and I ""took"" the official classes (i.e. I sat in class, most of the time, and I took the exams and did much of the homework...) but my teachers (who were quite awesome) recognized that I was ahead of the class and enjoyed teaching myself, so they threw me books like <i>PSSC Physics</i> and <i>What is Calculus About?</i> and told me to have fun.<p>That was, however, unofficial and sort of under the radar. I expect such a style of learning to continue to rise in popularity now that the Web is here. It's just easier than ever before to run an active learning program: There's so much stuff online to steer the students toward, and even the offline stuff is easier to find -- there are book-recommendation services and blogs to help you find the best print books, and used-book services to sell them to you cheap.

Personally I find the traditional teacher/student dynamic constraining.

Then came the later years and I wasn't doing so good because I was used to understand everything in class quickly, I wasn't expecting to have to spend time outside class to perform.<p>Here's a telling story: In some advanced math class in high-school, I was really having a hard time following, I had really bad grades. Then at some point I decide to tackle the material from the beginning on my own and in a couple weeks I totally turned the situation on its head and I had great grades!<p>Now picture this: I dropped out of college at term 5 out of 6 and since that time I've learned at a <i>much</i> greater pace and developed a thirst for advanced math and CS topics because I know I encounter some problems in my projects and this knowledge would give me a good framework to solve them much, much more easily.

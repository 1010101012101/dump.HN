277473,comment,277057,277396,0,0,tptacek,,,"This clear incentive you speak of is not in evidence on the actual Internet: find a site any of us have ever heard of that takes a credit card over a bare HTTP connection by default.<p>Self-signed certificates are ""insecure"", if you want to use that word, because there is no way to verify them. If you're Bob sending your certificate to Alice, Alice has absolutely no way to tell if she's seeing your cert or Mallory's.<p>Self-signed certs get used in non-HTTP apps, and in internal apps, because an out-of-band mechanism (thumb drives, key continuity, etc) is being used to distribute the certificates. If Alice already has your cert, and all you have to do is prove you hold the privkey for it, you and Alice have no problem.<p>Of course, if you think about this for 5 more seconds, you quickly realize that nobody on the Internet has your cert already, and without Verisign to break the tie between you and Mallory, you're totally fucked.",1218844521
277472,comment,277183,277272,0,0,aswanson,,,"I simply could not appreciate mathematics until university.  Memorizing times tables and repetitive drilling is not the way it should be taught at the earliest introduction.  I don't know how it can be done properly, but the way it is done at the early phases bored the hell out of me.  Later, much later, I learned to appreciate it's power and beauty.",1218844510

Maybe they can improve the quality of living there which adds to social stability, or come up with an innovation that can be shared with the planet, as information as easily shared these days.

277454,comment,276687,276975,0,0,gruseom,,,"But their suggestions had nothing to do with making Flickr and Delicious <i>better</i> - only more conformant to REST. Which was just my point: you have to assume that ""REST = good"" in order to call that ""better"". Personally, I'd rather learn about web app design by studying Flickr, Delicious, and Gmail than by making an assumption like that and then limiting my thinking to what it allows.<p>Another amusing thing about that book is how hard they had to struggle to find real-world examples that passed their REST purity test. If I recall correctly, that's the only reason why Flickr and Delicious even came up.",1218842468

This would have only been caught if the QA team decided to turn the clock forward a few days just to see what would happen.

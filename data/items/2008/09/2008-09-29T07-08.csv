I could never see myself driving something where I never have to touch the shifter once its in a forward gear.<p>As for the speed issue, you're right, it is slowing it down. (granted new paddle systems make that 60 milliseconds like the F430 Scuderia) But the Tesla only has 1 gear, which doesn't like going much past 100mph.",1222673700

318189,comment,317155,317715,0,0,Tichy,,,"Marriage is not a religious idea. It is a result of evolution, like everything else. Being a couple makes it easier to accomplish certain tasks. There are also animals who ""marry"" for life, it is just a strategy to cope with certain problems. Therefore cultures with marriage seem to have prevailed in the evolutionary competition.<p>Religion is just the handbook for a society (like the ""turnkey"" instructions manual for a McDonalds branch), therefore it includes marriage.<p>Also, I am confused: you are not religious, yet you style yourself as a supersensitive guy respecting the feelings of religious people. How about respecting the feelings of your son?",1222673171

318183,comment,317155,317630,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't know how marriage is handled in the US, but in Germany it is more than just a religious or cultural thing. It has several legal consequences, for example if your spouse is unconscious in the hospital, you are (officially) only allowed to visit if you are family. There are also tax breaks for married couples etc. I think the legal reasons would be a main reason to marry, after some point, the state basically forces you to marry because it is kind of stupid to not be allowed to visit your ill spouse.<p>Personally I despise the hypocrisy of the state when it forces a certain value system on us with the marriage laws (like tax breaks for married couples - so the state takes a stance against unmarried couples for moral reasons).",1222672959

And ready substitutes for Google's wares exist all over the place; not as good in some cases, but more than adequate.<p>Besides, Google is mostly a facilitator of transactions. The might get fractions of a penny from every dollar spent on the interwebs. So if that price is fair, presumably we would just have to pay a few micro-pennies more per item for distributors to find alternative ways to market their goods or spend a few micro-pennies more effort in searching for it ourselves.<p>That seems wrong to me somehow, as it can be very hard to find some things on engines other than Google. But it seems to make economic sense. Unless we consider the very low ""cut"" that Google is taking to be an anti-competitive measure?",1222672851

Still there seem to be some shared desires among humans in most societies.<p>And it is not about feel-goodness, either. We try not to bother our neighbours too much because in turn they won't bother us, either.

318176,comment,318134,318159,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Yeah I agree - I know they are not totally encumbered. Think it's more of a question of buoyancy. If SPARC deploys were to drop off it might be enough to drop below the waterline.<p>I guess I should have said that Solaris is actually being eroded on two fronts - On the x86 architecture they are under growing threat from Linux (and Windows). On the SPARC front Solaris is still a mainstay, but the SPARC market is being eroded... That is to say, if SPARC goes into serious decline they are in trouble.<p>SPARC has a good multicore strategy, but remains to be seen how this progresses. Again, a key market for this is financials (e.g. hedge funds like these architectures).<p>Solaris/SPARC still deployed in a lot of scenarios where (1) midrange is required, (2) it's a vendor requirement and (3) where there is security paranoia (e.g. Internet Banking, particularly in the DMZ) - Not saying these can't be achieved with other architectures, just the correlated factors I've witnessed.<p>Unfortunately, most of these are holding positions rather than growth areas. You're right about RHEL in the financial industry - particularly as Oracle is now more at home with Linux. It used to be Oracle and Solaris going hand in hand (anyone remember Oracles ""Raw Iron"" strategy?).<p>Interesting times for Sun all round.",1222672598

I am so excited that a company is embracing alternative fuels (electricity especially) in aims of making a supercar.<p>Gear shifting slows down a vehicle, regardless of how fast it is, since you're disconnecting the engine from the powertrain. It also is another thing you have to bother with while driving.",1222671951

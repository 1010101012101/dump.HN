They could also sell faster taxis, better drivers, etc.  Really doesn't matter.<p>> And how do they prevent people buying virtual goods from feeling as if they're ""cheating""?<p>I hear this asked -all the time-.  Two things.<p>(1) It's much less of an issue in games that aren't PvP.  ""You beat me in one-on-one combat because you paid"" is completely different than ""You have a higher score/advanced faster than I did because you paid"".  The ""cheating"" feeling doesn't go away, but it's much, much less pronounced.<p>(2) Allow players with time to trade with players with money.  The simplest, turnkey solution to this is a dual currency model.  Simply put, players with time get credits and players with money get tokens.  Players can trade credits and tokens on the free market.  This allows market forces to determine the cash value of credits, instead of you pegging a pricepoint to it.  I cannot stress how important dual-currency models are for games dealing with virtual goods.<p>> but it seems that for social status to work players have to feel invested in the community<p>Absolutely right.

What they're doing is really admirable (and hard), but they're going to do a lot more than many other, particularly smaller, datacenters simply because of their scale. From <a href=""http://www.google.com/corporate/green/datacenters/measuring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/corporate/green/datacenters/measuring....</a> :<p><i>Figure 1</i> (chart showing aggregate 1.19 PUE, some as low as 1.1) <i>summarizes the PUE results from all Google-designed data centers with an IT load of at least 5MW and time-in-operation of at least 6 months.</i><p>5MW is quite a bit of power. At a PUE of 2.0 that's 25000 amps (@100v), or about 8000-12000 idle servers. In Seattle, the breakover for the largest tier of power is 3MW, making 5MW about $194,000/mo (tariff 40) -> $0.053192 * (24<i>365.25/12) </i> 5000 = $194,283.<p>Obviously at these power levels being green is truly a matter of saving hundreds of thousands of dollars <i>per month</i>. It's a considerably tougher sell to justify high-efficiency construction in a small 100-200KW center, especially when colocating where cooling prices are obscured in the contracts under $/sq/ft instead of $/watt.",1233338830

I wonder, with a market of a billion users, does a set of software apps that are not back-compatible with our bloated legacy become plausible?<p>You could use old Windows or Unix apps. Or DOS apps. Or even old Apple ][ apps. Or, you could write an entirely new set of apps - a fresh start, in a fresh market, on fresh hardware. Doesn't that have a certain appeal?<p>Freed from back-compatibility with bloated software, does a $10 laptop become plausible?<p>Maybe something like the hp200lx: DOS, 24x80 LCD screen with incredible battery life (2 AA batteries), came with lotus 123 spreadsheet etc. Or, even lower specs than that.",1233338609

Modern diesel engines produce way less smog and noise than the average US car or pickup engine.<p>> Modern diesel engines to not produce less smog than a gasoline engine, they produce more.<p>I think bdfh42 was referring to the existing fleet (including old vehicles) of registered gasoline-powered vehicles. An important point, though, is that newer vehicles tend to be driven more. To wit: the average <i>new</i> passenger vehicle is driven ~15,000 miles per year, whereas the average registered passenger vehicle <i>in general</i> (new+used) is only driven ~12,000 miles per year. The more a vehicle is driven, the more pollution it emits, so it is important for new vehicles to be cleaner than old vehicles.",1233338566

Further adventures of a curious character. (R. P. Feynman)<p>I serendipitously found the Feynman books right after I dropped out of college while I was flying around interviewing for jobs. It was a stressful time and I was feeling pretty dejected, but then I found these amazing books: this Feynman guy was running around having <i>fun</i> and enjoying life, rejecting the notion of convention for the sake of convention, but the amazing thing was that he did it while being a <i>completely real</i> and <i>serious</i> scientist.<p>Godel, Escher, Bach was pretty good too, but it wasn't a transformative experience for me. It probably would've been great if I had read it when I was 14 or 15 when my dad first gave me his copy... but I read the first few pages and decided I didn't want to read 1000 pages of flowery literary/historical junk.",1214668111

230622,comment,229793,230388,0,0,jey,,,"Assuming the AI is built to be rational, the AI will act according to its goal system. So it's not going to do that unless you make some mistake or omission in its goal system, since it would have to find the motivation to ""impersonate shell companies, human beings, etc""  somewhere in its goals. This hints at two major problems in building an AI: how do you make it rational (That's the ""intelligence"" part) and how do you come up with a goal system that is safe and beneficial from our (the human race's) perspective?<p>Eliezer has written a paper addressing these questions: <a href=""http://singinst.org/AIRisk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://singinst.org/AIRisk.pdf</a>.

Who uses it?<p>We all love to read success stories but shouldn't we ask that the provenance of such stories be provided? Here we jump into discussing the advice of a total stranger - an unknow with no credentials. ""Nukemanbill""  could be sitting inside a mental institution or another teenager playing mind games. Or maybe he just read the book ""All Marketers Are Liars"" by Seth Godin and is testing Godin's ideas. Hell, maybe he's a SPAMmer selling Godin's book and thus this post.<p>The only URL on the site that has any provenance whatsoever is the one to JoelOnSoftware. Heck, I question even Joel's BS ofttimes because his is a private company and we don't know whether he's floating on his past Microsoft earnings or really makes money. Should I read someone's writings because he posts a known URL?<p>Taleb's right - humans are natural-born suckers. We're too trusting even here on HN. IMO if you own a company and want to give advice then you should be willing to name yourself and the company. Without that it's just SPAM.<p>To it's credit the advice given is worth every cent I paid for it.",1214666852

230618,comment,227406,228055,0,0,alabut,,,"Best tip ever Paul - having your own personal website where you can try out new styles, programming techniques or even just write about them is critical for a young designer. Or old ones! I don't use my personal site that much anymore (I'll revamp it after the wedding) but it was more useful during my first few years than any book I ever picked up on css, actionscripting, design, usability or anything else. You'll find new things to experiment with over time - I'm going to redo the portfolio section of my site as an excuse to tinker with django and blueprintcss.<p>It's a bit dated but there's a good book on the topic by Joe Shepter called ""Personal Web Sites: Top Designers Push the Boundaries with Experimental Design and Graphics"" - Amazon link: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3wxy7h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3wxy7h</a>",1214666157

230612,comment,227406,227615,0,0,alabut,,,"This is an awesome little book and a bit of a secret, probably because the title, color scheme of the cover and relative thinness make it look less like something to be seriously and more of a ""design for dummies"" book. Not at all - it's a short and excellent distillation of core graphic design principles down to a few short fundamentals.<p>An even shorter and online version of the same idea - the blog post on ""how c.r.a.p. is your design?"" on the role and usage of contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity:<p><a href=""http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/how-crap-is-your-site-designprint/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/how-crap-is-your...</a>",1214665521

230609,comment,227406,227752,0,0,alabut,,,"I agree and would go even further - most designers that start out as graphic designers are doomed to fail as web designers and I've rarely seen any that made the transition completely. The high profile people making high bandwidth flashturbation for movies, rock bands or new vodka brands don't count - just because an ad agency can sell it to a big corporate client doesn't mean that's what the website's visitors will enjoy or be able to use easily.<p>Web design is not graphic design. It's not a subset of it, not even a sibling design branch and if anything, it's a distant cousin. Making stuff for the web is much closer to industrial/product design and architecture than anything in the communication arts. It's a different matter to design things simply to look good than it is to design how they work.<p>Longer explanation at alistapart:\n<a href=""http://alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alistapart.com/articles/understandingwebdesign</a><p>So then how would you learn fundamental design principles without getting polluted by the biases of print design? The best answers below are a bit dispersed (too many pointers to the css/html/js skills you said you already know) so I'll distill: 1) learn only the core graphic design principles - see endlessvoid94's book recommendation. 2) I second PStamatiou's advice to get your own site and start tinkering with it immediately, preferably a blog. Can't stress this second tip enough, actually.",1214665257

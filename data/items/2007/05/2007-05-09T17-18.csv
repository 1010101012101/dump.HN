Users search and find information all over the web (not only where you tell them because you sure do not know all the places where good info resides) and bring it to you. Nice. And all you RSS reader wants you to do is submit an interesting comment or story every now and then. Sweet.",1178733458

When you play chess with a strong computer, or a living grandmaster, both are formidable opponents playing the same game. Talking to an educated person and a strong AI capable computer would be participating in the same discussion. (I don't know if this is objectionable but it makes perfect sense to me; if you see otherwise, do explain.)<p>However, if and when that happens, the world is going down a wildly different path, and that problem you point out will be a minor one, compared to some dramatic job cuts it will likely bring about and the businesses that it wipes out.",1178732993

20828,comment,20565,20565,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""Acquisitions that are done as stock swaps are obviously not the same as cash transactions. Public companies often use their stock as trading currency for acquisitions since it has no cash impact on their business. However, stock transactions dilute the value of other shareholders, sometimes significantly. In a rising stock market no one really notices because the steady share price increase masks the dilution.""<p>He's probably repeating secondhand an explanation he didn't understand the first time, because he got some of the words right but didn't make any sense. Whether you buy a company with cash, stock, bonds, favors, or anything else, the point is to get more than you pay for. AOL swapped some stock for control of Time Warner -- their stock was overpriced, TW was (arguably) underpriced, and when everything settled, AOL shareholders had lost 80% of their investment instead of 99% of their investment.<p>Trading $250 million in stock for $250 million worth of someone else' company isn't something you have to 'hide' with an increasing share price (and why would the price go up, if the company is blatantly devaluing itself?). Dodge didn't think this through, and it shows.",1178732603

Individual projects fail all the time for no reason. What's more telling is the chance that you'll succeed big somewhere at some point. Part of being smart is trying lots of random stuff and failing or getting bored and doing something else. ",1178732328

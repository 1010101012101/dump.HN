546698,comment,546517,546517,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"For the most part, several Javascript libraries have solved the basics of cross-platform browser support quite well and entire ecosystems were built using them.<p>I regard Ext Core to being quite similar to other libraries even though it could pack more quality features into just a relatively small file. That is, If I were looking for something ""current"" I would look into Ext Core as well. But I have high hopes for YUI 3 which will have dynamic loading of features and contextual programming with both CSS and Javascript to let folks create relatively safe and packaged Javascript programs that could then be embedded in other sites without disrupting their looks or functions.<p>Perhaps YUI 3 is a little bit on the ""over-engineering"" side, but so long as it works as a stable foundation down the road it could well be the future.",1238882286

He even goes so far as to start impeaching the FBI informant by showing his picture and labeling he and his wife ""drug addict"" and ""mrs. drug addict""<p>I'm thinking he's looking for slander charges on top of what he already has? Not sure though -- and quite frankly its not worth my time to investigate.<p>If -- and its a big if -- the FBI is screwing him over accidentally, then this will make a great case study for law enforcement on how not to do this. The truth will out. If, on the other hand, somebody has been playing in the cookie jar, no amount of yelling ""gestapo"" and ""police state"" is going to help him. The best it will do is play to the mindset of folks who are already paranoid to begin with.<p>This is a brave man. He should sit down and shut up. That's always the best criminal defense publicity strategy at first. The only thing you're going to do, innocent or not, is provide facts which can be discredited later on.

But that also means adding contacts for everyone you want to talk to, so it's not really a company standard.<p>We use IM extensively and have a public (as in 'on the open net') Jabber server. If you have an account here, you'll automatically have the whole company at your disposal.<p>We also have conference rooms for collaboration and a bunch of bots operating here. If you're in software, you'll have access to the dev room, for example. All the build information and unit test results get dumped there. Conference rooms are also great for a-synchronous group communication.<p>The main office has a high speed data link and you can connect to it via OpenVPN. This gives you access to the code repositories, testing databases (mainly for projects), wikis and other stuff depending on your profile.<p>Oh, yeah, we use email too :) But that's mostly for announcements, long-running discussions and communicating with third-parties.<p>I've used gotomeeting on my virtual windows machine for going through some project-specific details. Voice still goes through Skype.<p>IRC is great for a couple of developers on a private channel, but generally sucks for running a project or a company with non-techies. Run your own XMPP server.<p>Disciplined coding ninjas are rare. Use a centralized source repository and have everyone commit to that. We use SVN and with trac on top of it, it's a win situation all 'round. People that want to use git can use git-svn. (If you have developers complaining about SVN and not being able to use git-svn, you shouldn't have them committing in the first place).<p>Wikis (especially those from trac with integration with your source code) are a really good way to document some knowledge.",1238880046

The problem remains that there will likely still exist at least one person for whom some trade-off of little or no substance is important (even essential).<p>When people talk about power, elegance and abstraction of a language (not compiler, VM, libraries, etc) they are talking about the language platformed on the human brain (something unique to the individual).  Ruby targets a certain brain platform while C targets a different one and Scala yet another.  Twitter engineers sound like they have brains appropriate for both Ruby and Scala.  Scala makes less technical trade-offs toward their end and so there arises a clear winner (for them).<p>The day we're all using the same brain platform then there could be argued to exist a best language.",1238880034

They aren't exactly incompetent rabble-rousers, but they tend to do more investigative journalism and ""what-if"" scenarios than your average major daily newspaper. I doubt they have any real direct experience with this particular corner of the IT industry, though, because it's incredibly unlikely that pirated movies prompted the takedown.<p>I've worked at various hosting companies around Dallas for 5 years, and have worked or observed quite a few abuse cases involving the federal government. This sort of heavy-handed action (killing an entire company's operations for a single client) has NEVER happened in my experience, and definitely not for something as innocuous as copyright infringement. That's what the DMCA is for. The feds don't get involved unless it's some seriously nasty stuff going on, like child porn, suspected terrorist communication, fraud, malware distribution, etc.<p>In the event that the government gets involved, they will have a field agent demand access to individual systems under a subpoena, but only to the systems actually involved (maybe some switches/routers as well). Unless Core IP has been proven to be complicit in some kind of ultra-illegal activity, e.g. the CTO is the kingpin of some hardcore piracy network, I have a hard time believing that this has anything to do with a leaked movie. I'd think that the Secret Service (US Treasury) would be involved in such a case, rather than the FBI.<p>This really is completely ridiculous, though. Makes you want to go read the common carrier laws cover-to-cover :)<p>edit: I guess this piracy thing has been confirmed as a rumor for some time... but hopefully this sheds some light about how the process works :)",1238880007

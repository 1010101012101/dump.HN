Occasionally I&#x27;ve been able to extract a hiring bonus or something relatively minor like that, but the insistence with which they stick to the salary is mind-boggling.<p>It got really absurd at my last job, where I was co-lead on the most profitable team in the company and a &quot;10x&quot; developer: I got an offer for much more money elsewhere, so I regretfully (I really liked that job) sent in my resignation. They asked me why, I told them it was honestly too much money to pass up. My &quot;people&quot; manager, project manager, and a senior manager fought hard to get me a counteroffer. They escalated all the way to the VP of HR, a direct report of the CEO. The final response was &quot;no, he can&#x27;t have that, that would be out of band, and he can&#x27;t move out of the band yet because his degree + years of experience doesn&#x27;t equal x.&quot; This <i>materially affected</i> the company. One of our clients in particular was a little paranoid and I had developed a great working relationship with them - when I left, they effectively put in a stop work for months until they were satisfied my replacements understood the system as well as I did. (Which I don&#x27;t believe was necessary; they were not as good, but they were and are good enough, but the guy was really paranoid. Perhaps understandably, since bugs would have directly led to financial mishaps.)<p>But in general the band system saves companies money, so they stick with it.<p>Of course there are plenty of exceptions - things are obviously different in startups, for example, where HR might not even exist, and plenty of companies don&#x27;t give HR so much power.",1427109927

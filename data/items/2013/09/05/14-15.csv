6334578,comment,6332038,6334276,1,0,sullichin,,,"- Demon Firesage isn&#x27;t particularly weak to fire. And what does it matter? You don&#x27;t need a fire weapon to kill him.  You also don&#x27;t need to parry Gwyn to beat him, so why does it need to be spelled out? Although there is often a message by the door that says Try Parrying.<p>The game isn&#x27;t really about trying a bunch of stuff until you find the &quot;right&quot; way to beat an area. If you think your best bet is to go everywhere and pick up every item, then you don&#x27;t have a very good understanding of the character building mechanics. Of course the game does not go out of its way to explain its mechanics, and whether that is genius or bad design is up to you I guess. There are plenty of other games that hand-hold and don&#x27;t have the time investment requirement of Dark Souls. I feel like Dark Souls respects the player much more than those games, because you truly do have the freedom to make your own choices.",1378393156

6334573,comment,6329619,6333058,1,0,aphyr,,,"<i>Yeah, I&#x27;m curious about how you achieved those numbers.</i><p>Jepsen&#x27;s code is open source (<a href=""http://github.com/aphyr/jepsen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/aphyr/jepsen</a>) and I&#x27;ve written extensively about the techniques involved; see <a href=""http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen</a> for details. Cassandra work is upcoming; no formal writeup yet.<p><i>Your test that gets that 2-5% of writes (though your docs say 7.5%) to be messed up...</i><p>Sorry, 2-5% was my mistake. Been playing around with the parameter space; numbers vary a bit.<p><i>what is really is measuring is the probability that out of 5 concurrent clients writing to 4 servers, at least two will finish writing to a row with the exact same timestamp... AND that they will be the LAST ones to write to that row. If just one of those clients ends up just a hair behind the other four, then you should register 0 collisions.</i><p>In a Dynamo system, a.) there is no such thing as &quot;time&quot;, b.) there is no such thing as &quot;last&quot;, and c.) causality tracking beats everything. Doesn&#x27;t matter what order you do the writes in; timestamps (and/or vclocks in Voldemort/Riak) take precedence.<p><i>What is even weirder is your benchmark takes 100 seconds to complete what amounts to 5000 writes, or averaging a rate of 50 writes per second, 10 writes per client per second. Those are pathetic numbers for a one node Cassandra cluster, let alone a four node one. WTF is going on here?</i><p>Each client in the Jepsen test harness is (independently) scheduling n writes per second. Jepsen schedules its writes this way to a.) avoid measuring an overloaded system, b.) produce results which are somewhat comparable between runs, and c.) measure results over changing underlying dynamics--in this case, a network partition.<p><i>Even more confusing, you are writing with ANY consistency, which means that in many cases those writes will be stamped and committed on different nodes, yet somehow getting the same timestamp. Odds on this seem... highly suspect. It almost seems like your clock only has 1 second resolution, which is weird.</i><p>There&#x27;s an interesting probability anecdote called the Birthday Paradox, which says that if you get 30 people in a room, chances are good that 2 will share the same birthday. At ten uniformly distributed writes a second, the probability of a timestamp collision is 0.44%... in any given second. Chances of a collision after a thousand seconds of runtime are 99.9999%. If you push 100 writes per second, collision probability is 50% <i>in any second</i>. If you push only 2 writes every second, you should expect to see a collision once every few days. How long-lived is that collision? It depends on the distribution of writes over time, and on the network, but you can work out a mean free path.<p>TL;DR: microsecond timestamps do not provide sufficient entropy for uniqueness constraints over common workloads.<p><i>I also see Cassandra timeouts while writing with consistency ANY, yet are still somehow getting timeouts with this operation. That really screams to me that the cluster is truly messed up.</i><p>The timeouts in this case are, I think, a Cassandra bug (or expected behavior) when partitions occur. Last I heard from jbellis, it wasn&#x27;t clear what Cassandra should do under these conditions, but I think he was leaning towards allowing the local hint to count as success always.<p><i>Now, as you say, if you control the timestamps, you get collisions 99.9% of the time. I don&#x27;t even get why it isn&#x27;t just straight up 100% for that case.</i><p>The reason not all writes result in conflict with \nidentical timestamps is, I suspect, due to that transitional period during the beginning of the network partition.",1378393100

We&#x27;re not at all talking about educational policy here, we&#x27;re talking about your childhood problems - only you&#x27;re confusing the subject matter.<p>History has been going in the exact opposite direction - we treat more and more adults as children, with extended schooling, cushy jobs removed from front-line business concerns, etc. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve benefitted from all this.

Interest rates are presently something like 15 basis points ($150 per year on $100k).

6334408,comment,6333453,6333966,4,0,ianstallings,,,"(Putting this as its own thread because it&#x27;s so large and slightly off-topic).<p>I&#x27;ve thought long and hard on this, it&#x27;s one of my life goals to create a piece of software that could mimic good players in texas hold-em, and I think I might have found a way to do just that using big data, hand histories, neural-networking, and a ton of input by actual players. Or at least a good start.<p>How would I accomplish this? Well a very high-level overview below. Basically it starts out extremely stupid and grows as a player:<p>1. Dump hand histories from pros into a large database. The number of hand histories would run into the billions. Users could dump online logs in bulk or create one-offs using input software.<p>2. Create an input system for a single user to choose a random hand-history and then classify it using tags. For instance tags might help categorize the player&#x27;s style, the opponent&#x27;s style, the &quot;street&quot; of play they are tagging, common name for the  situation (Facing donk-bet on flop after raising pre-flop), etc. I would leave this fairly flexible and allow users to create new tags. Think similar to Galaxy Zoo but a little less rigid.<p>3. Using these tags/classifications the system would create a poll and present it to users with a question. What would you do in this particular situation? Where that situation is point in time of a hand history.<p>4. Eventually the computer player would then have a <i>huge</i> number of situations to use as examples with input from humans on how to proceed. This obviously will be very <i>fuzzy</i> and that&#x27;s where, IMHO, the strength of the bot actually lies. The system would not lead to a rigid &quot;Do X when Y occurs&quot;. It would decide from a large range of choices that have been entered by humans in the polls described above, leaning towards the most common answers first, but trying outliers also.<p>5. Use a neural network to create pathways based on previous successes.<p>How would this work once it&#x27;s all together? An example:<p>The computer player is dealt AJ off-suit while being last to act on the dealer button. It would <i>ask</i> the database for a set of situations where AJ was dealt to players in the same position. It would then choose one of them and look at the results of the polls. How do most people with the highest success rate play this hand in this particular spot? Choose a random path to take based on that data. Observe and record outcome. This data becomes the true empirical data that the system will eventually rely on. If the situation has been encountered before in it&#x27;s own play it will look at that and use it <i>or</i> it might choose randomly like it did above from the polling data. Eventually the weight of the empirical data it has collected might outweigh the data from the polls and it will &quot;know&quot; the right move based on its previous pathway choices. If this move is recognized by the opponent and exploited the results would dictate that the system falls back on another random choice. As the data set grows and the system plays the game, it could hypothetically be tuned to play consistently well.<p>The main hurdle is actually user-input. There would need to be incentive for users to enter the data they think is correct. The system is also open to manipulation through input data so that would need to be thwarted. And then on top of that the system would have to play an enormous amount of hands to create known successful pathways. But I think the sheer randomness and human-like qualities of the system would create a truly awesome experience.<p>(Joking) Now, does anyone have the $1M+ USD I need to fund this? I promise I&#x27;ll pay you back. ;)",1378391399

The upgrade-pricing model follows the rationale that users pay a higher up-front cost for software, then each upgrade is a maintenance fee to support continued improvement of the software. The flat-cost model spreads the cost of continued software development equally over all users.<p>The feeling of whether or not this is &quot;fair&quot; depends upon whether you&#x27;re a new user or an existing user. With the upgrade-pricing model, new users are confronted with a much lower price point, which is unavailable to them. This can be a significant psychological barrier to purchase execution. However, existing users are more likely to feel appreciated and stick with the product because they receive favorable pricing.<p>With the flat-cost model, you have the inverse. New users no longer feel marginalized, but existing users may consider alternatives at each time-of-purchase for upgrades.<p>Apple&#x27;s vision of flat-cost pricing dictates that the price point should be held as low as possible, increasing accessibility from a broader market. With software, there are no incremental costs, so your price point is a matter of supply/demand tuning. There are countless blog articles on this subject.<p>While there isn&#x27;t consensus on which model (flat-cost vs upgrade-pricing) is the most successful, each has its pros and cons for consumers. I don&#x27;t think either could be characterized as fair or unfair.",1378391344

I didn&#x27;t say you were forced as some kind of hard requirement to use the wiki - just that the use of the wiki forces you out of the game and that it is clearly designed to be used in conjunction with a wiki. It should be taken as read that it can be played without it. I mean, who wrote the wiki? The requirement for guessing and repeating segments is just so high that it detracts from the experience. This isn&#x27;t about knowing every little detail for &quot;min-maxing&quot; either -  it&#x27;s about basic organization to make discovery of information systematic rather than being a sheer time sink. So tell me: how do you figure out that for the Demon Firesage - located in a fiery area, covered in fire - the weakness is.. fire? Trying a bunch of stuff, in this case totally counter-intuitive. What reason would you have to think Gwyn can be parried, when no other boss in the game can be? By trying a bunch of stuff and stumbling upon it since, again, it is counter-intuitive. In other words: by having complete and utter contempt for the value of your own time.<p>It completely takes away from the sense of fantasy, as well. The whole point with these open world games is to feel like you have the freedom to make your own choices. But if you know that your best best is to go everywhere and pick up every item you can then it feels like janitorial work, not a grand adventure.",1378390362

At some point I lost all my custom configuration and never had time to reconfigure.<p>A few weeks ago, I spent pretty much an entire day configuring Emacs, installing packages, themes, etc....In the end, things didn&#x27;t really work awesomely.  Key-binding issues on my OS X, certain short-cuts not working completely in org-mode, etc... (when not using an external keyboard, I absolutely abhor pressing the &quot;option&quot; key on my MBPro keyboard.)<p>Then I tweaked out Sublime Text.  I appreciated how simple it was to change the themes, and install packages (though with emacs 24 m-x install-package was pretty simple, too), and it seems there&#x27;s a package for anything (including a super-basic org-mode).  And spending $70 on cross-platform closed source is probably worth my time that I save in configuration.<p>Though, who knows....I know enough VIM to edit server config files, maybe it&#x27;s time I look into that for JavaScrip/Python development.",1378389707

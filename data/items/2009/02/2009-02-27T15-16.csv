Small towns have/are them.<p>I pointed out that every largish US city has them.  (Oakland and Berkeley's are better than SF's.)<p>Heck - almost every south (sf) bay city has one or two.  I forgot to mention that Menlo Park has at least one and I only remembered two of PA and SJ's - both have at least three, and I'm almost certainly missing more in SJ than PA.<p>> In other words, people aren't really choosing<p>Except that they are.  They are readily available, a huge fraction of people spend a couple of years in them, and yet most people don't choose them for the majority of their lives.<p>It's interesting that (some of) their advocates can't see them unless they're the only option.<p>> Also, what's with the ""diverse"" scare quotes?<p>They're not scare quotes.  I'm pointing out idiosyncratic usage.  ""Diverse community"" typically means that the residents are ethnic and/or culture mix.  What he's referring to is typically called ""mixed use"".",1235750166

Better follow an established trajectory in an industry, impossible products find a way to relax one or two constraints that better have taken as fixed, and unthinkable products--typically developed by someone from outside the target industry or the result of repurposing a product from another industry--create a new category of product.  Some examples of unthinkable products: IDDQ testing in semiconductors, the Reebok Pump shoe, or Ford realizing that a meat packing plant's ""disassembly line"" could be run backward to assemble a car.",1235750107

The advantage would be cost and simple scalability, especially if you're running on EC2 so you don't have to pay for all the back and forth transfer from EC2 to S3.  Concerns might be latency issues and whether this would scale to billions of objects.  Other than that, it would seem like you could run a pretty huge site off of just a couple beefy servers.",1235750031

This must be consumed in a flavorless window, which is at least one hour after flavors have been consumed, and at least one hour before flavors will be consumed.[4] The consumption of these flavorless calories supposedly lowers the set point, and therefore, lowers weight.""<p>I just mention this because I've read the authors paper ""Self-experimentation as a source of new ideas: Ten examples about sleep, mood, health, and weight"" and it seemed really interesting.

We tried neo4j, which exploded trying to import data on the order that we're working with and a couple of RDF databases, which survived the import, but were a couple of orders of magnitude off from the performance we were hoping for.<p>After writing some 8 different backends for our store class and none being within an order of magnitude of our own prototype for the sorts of applications we're doing, it seemed more fruitful to round out our own application rather than continuing the seemingly endless recurse of possible data backends which ranged from mildly to amazingly disappointing.<p>If you've got something specific that you've worked with in the past that you think would be worth our while to evaluate, I'd consider investing the time to try it out.  But just that there exist more options that we could evaluate at the moment doesn't necessarily imply that it's reasonable to keep writing new backends, which sometimes take a non-trivial amount of effort.",1235748873

That being said, if you're putting email accounts in your low-security tier, revisit that assumption.  Now.  It makes every password which can be reset or recovered as secure as the least secure site you have ever signed up with.<p>Think of how much fun life would be if you woke up one morning and someone had compromised gmail, had godaddy send a password reminder, and then used your credentials to initiate and then authorize a transfer of your business domain to their registrar.

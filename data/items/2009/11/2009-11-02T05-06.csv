Many factors affect visual acuity including the shape of the eyeball (affects focal point of lens on retina), cornea (defects cause astigmatism), retinal damage like macular degeneration which leads to functional blindness, and the function of the muscles which adjust our focus within our visual range.  Eye strain can take a significant toll on those muscles and eventually lead to a sometimes significant loss of visual acuity (myopia.)  Fortunately the muscles can often be retrained.  Search Amazon for books on vision correction and you will find a ton of books that essentially help you retrain your eye muscles to improve your visual acuity.<p>sample book on Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Relearning-See-Improve-Eyesight-Naturally/dp/1556433417/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Relearning-See-Improve-Eyesight-Natura...</a>",1257140990

Evolution is basically the products produced by reality that <i>work</i>, and this is by definition. So in essence we try to speed up evolution by designing. We try to predict what <i>works</i> before it gets there by random luck. Obviously the simplest algorithm is to try random iterations that are completely independent of past ones, but this is essentially <i>evolution</i>. So what Linus is in favor of is <i>guided</i> evolution, that is instead of trying random iterations, we try to predict the next working iteration based on past knowledge, and identifying any patterns. Of course everyone probably does this. Unfortunately most people break out of this if they don't understand this, and may be blinded by ego. So when you can't admit you're doing something wrong, you're no longer designing through guided evolution, you're designing by complete random chance at best.<p>In any case evolution is the absolute process that design tries to mimick because its results are by definition what we are trying to achieve.",1257139260

If you were scraping a site's content and publishing it elsewhere maybe there would be a case, but for personal use you can create as many derivative works as you like under fair use. If not then accessibility features like screen readers and magnifiers (many of which are built into browsers) would be illegal.<p>Users are free to modify site's content as much as they want, using adblockers or using cornify, etc. This is no different than someone cutting out parts of articles from a magazine to make their own collages.

1. It's not at all my construction. That's precisely why it's hard to see originality in this.
2. If you read his post carefully, you'll see that the author isn't aware of distinction between past simple and present perfect, let alone of ablaut: he confuses ""swam"" and ""swum"" and then proceeds to use the newly invented past tense form of ""cutch"" in present perfect.
3. Ablaut would be along the lines of think-thank-thunk -- something the author is not suggesting.
4. Think and catch already have the ""weird umlaut morph"". Changing it to the ""swim-swam-swum"" pattern is, like I said, nothing new.",1257138779

On the other hand, every major naval force at the beginning of WWII had major flaws with their torpedoes ... and the US Navy was pretty much the worst in dealing with them (Washington refused to listen and the various flaws had to be debugged in Hawaii; by contrast the Germans found and fixed theirs quickly and cashiered two officers responsible for them (the latter from memory)).",1265820730

Do you do a paleolithic diet?  I heard about that, but to be honest, eating raw red meats sounds pretty scary, unless you're going to be eating grass-fed animals that are not grown in a ""factory farm"" like most meat is now.<p>edit:  I read your links and found them very interesting.  I think one of the problems that agricultural societies in general have is that they started milling their whole grains into flour.  The articles mention tooth decay as a problem of modern agricultural societies.  Flour is a huge problem because it is easily processed and turns into sugars quickly, growing bacteria that causes tooth decay.<p>As long as you stick to whole grains, and not ""crushed"" or milled grains, you should be ok.  Brown rice instead of white rice, buckwheat, quinoa, wild rice, amaranth, and a host of others.  The important part is not to break or remove the outer shell or husk of the grain.

(See www.historyexplained.com for the theoretical model of aristocrat-peasant and tribal societies; but bear in mind that its model of history is wrong. Read _1491: New Revalations of the Americas Before Columbus_; had the northern American Indians only been immune to smallpox, we'd think of democratic-market societies as a shoddy alternative to the one true way of self-controlled tribalism -- which the Middle Ages, too, had been fitfully evolving into.)<p>So, the problem is not that children have short attention spans; it's that they haven't learned to fake interest in the manner expected in Western societies. (From your name, I'm guessing that you're American or Canadian.) When a Western child, or a member of most types of tribal societies, is bored, he or she doesn't try to hide it; by contrast, when genuinely interested in something, such a person exhibits a passionate interest uninhibited by concepts of aristocratic reserve.<p>In short: figure out what a child is interested in -- or rather, let the child figure that out for him- or herself -- and all the rest should come together on its own.

The military was winning the Vietnam War, it was just taking longer than necessary because the White House was micromanaging the war and establishing unrealistic rules and requirements.<p>As for piracy, the Navy has been kept out of the game because it's cheaper to pay ransom than to pay for any significant military operations against pirates. There was a time where we would say ""millions for defense but not a penny for tribute"", land the Marines in North Africa, and force the pirates to allow safe passage.

Personally, I grew up on mostly different shows than everyone else anyway, so I only shared experiences with an extremely small group of people, most of whom I'm sure I never met.  Bill Nye, Nova, and generally PBS (no cable) were my shows of choice through all of elementary school.  I also had the Animaniacs lineup near its beginning, but the vast majority of other kids my age (at my school) didn't get most of it.<p>Not bragging about my ""mental might"" here, my parents & older sister just did a good job loading me with things to learn before and during that age, so I had a real intellectual advantage at elementary school.  They taught me most things 1-on-1 well before they came up in school.  It's definitely put me in a different social circle, as I associate more with geeks than other stereotypes, but I'm happy here.  For myself, I'll call not sharing a lot of the ""normal"" TV experience a positive thing.",1265818287

Then I continue with the project.<p>By small feature, I mean UI elements, basic functionality and layout etc. I don't want to make the entire UI or a complex feature and then find out my users don't like it. So now I wait for my friends to tell me if the logo looks ok, the colors are decent, or if the keyboard shortcut makes sense.<p>I would love to form a group with HNers to test out little things in each other's apps on a regular basis and give feedback. It would be more like sharing with team mates and less like an organized beta-test. Would anyone be interested in something like this?

The gulf between the 18thC and our own is an enormous one in general, come to think of it; play _Empire: Total War_ for a sense of just how different even the visual aesthetics of their era were from our own.<p>Don't look at the art assets that are, necessarily, more or less faithful to the period; look at how the game's developers try to make the era look interesting to a modern. What most stood out to me was the vast gulf between the national flags used in the 18thC and national flags depicted in the game -- in particular Austria, where the red-and-white national flag is replaced by the yellow-and-black dynastic flag of the Habsburgs, and Russia, where the white-red-blue national flag is shame-facedly tacked on to the Romanov coat of arms.

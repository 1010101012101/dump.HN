Also knowing how many are actually moving to the Valley vs. moving back to where they're based.<p>I'm sure there will be another meetup, but maybe not before Oct 18th :)",1187657848
44561,comment,44365,44432,0,0,staunch,,,"This is exactly what I've seen so far. I've lived in enough ""bad areas"" in my life that my quota is all used up. I want to live somewhere relatively safe. I also want to keep my ""personal burn rate"" low. Oakland is totally out. I'm not sure anywhere in the city qualifies. My current plan is to either commute a long way or give in and pay a lot in rent.<p>Anyone have suggestions of safe areas that aren't overly expensive or too far away?",1187657615

No updating software, all your files are there for you whereever you go and today we have the bandwidth to handle it (we do vid downloads without batting an eyelid!).<p>Especially with Google's gears coming along, it will mean we can do everything offline. It's getting close to CMS your home dir and apps.<p>When I was in high school (15 years ago or so) I said the perfect computer app would be one where you didn't know it was there and just used it to do what ever you wanted, like in TNG. This is getting close!",1187657570
44559,comment,44525,44525,0,0,champion,,,"Of course, there are lots of Boston area startups beyond the few YC funds. And most of those doing YC don't have Boston roots, so they might not have much reason to stay.<p>To the larger point, Boston needs a stronger and more vibrant community of hackers, esp. for those interested in the web. <p>And I'm bummed I missed the meetup last night...",1187657530

44541,comment,44330,44330,0,0,aaroneous,,,"Congrats on launching your site! Now my thoughts...<p>1. You have no content and presumably just launched, but yet the browsing experience was obnoxiously slow. Why?<p>And<p>2. I don't get it. Why are you using user submitted news for geographical locations? What value does this offer over going to the website for a local paper? Why would you rely on user submitted news for something that could seemingly easily be aggregated? <p>I'd like to strongly echo what the other two posters said - why do I want to use this site? I clicked around, and really couldn't get much of a feel for where you're adding value. ",1187654732

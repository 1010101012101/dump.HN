I played around briefly with a system which put metadata in a RAM disk (battery backed up to SSD) and actual data blocks on the disk. There was a huge benefit in that system of splitting the metadata i/o's from the read/write I/Os, really helped overall performance. I look forward to seeing the whitepaper on this tech if they publish it.",1351051154
4691576,comment,4688636,4689193,3,0,tesseractive,,,"A hypothetical ideal business in this segment would find a way to profit off of attracting people interesting in sampling new businesses for long-term patronage rather than making its money off of the price sensitive. The idea would be that you would find a way to make the proposition most appealing to people who are looking for a new... hairstylist/florist/gym/supermarket/whatever, and either avoid targeting offers at people who are likely to sample at  a low price and move on, or make the offer less appealing to them.<p>This has been a key part of the mailing list business for many years -- lists that target people who have recently moved, gotten pregnant or had a baby, gotten married, and so on. Special offers with unusually good deals are then offered, because the chance of converting a percentage of the recipients into long-term customers makes it worth it.<p>If this kind of business model has been translated to online effectively, I'm not familiar with it. Certainly some of that effect can be achieved with the right search keywords or the right websites to advertise on (e.g. baby name sites), but businesses like Groupon and Living Social have brought in many more price sensitive customers than actual long-term business prospects, which is one of the big reasons why they are not more successful.",1351051125

From AnandTech's review just typing into Office takes 50% CPU.<p>I had totally expected Microsoft will get Office right - touch friendly, not relying on classic Desktop and relatively bloat free. If integrated well with the tablet interface it would become a better productivity machine for Enterprise users than competition's offerings.<p>With what is being said of Office RT, I don't see what the selling point of Surface is - It is Windows but can't run Windows apps, it is a tablet but needs to switch to classic to run a so-so version of touch-unfriendly Office (Do I get Outlook with it?).<p>May be it will be a better story with Surface Pro.",1351050825
4691566,comment,4691417,4691417,13,0,alwaysinshade,,,"I sort of touched on this in a HN thread a few days ago [1]. I dont think that mobile devices are successfully replacing conventional PCs, more so replacing objects and knickknacks that were single function devices. For instance, my wife uses an ipad to read books because she can take her whole library with her wherever she goes and download new books while sitting on the train. I use an app that turns my phones flash into a torch when Im looking for something in the dark. My ~2 year old nephew uses a drum and piano app on an ipad to play instruments, and animated book-like apps for entertainment. Buying these objects now would be for almost purely ornamental reasons. Little things that we use each day whether for utility or entertainment are being supplanted by multi-function mobile devices because 1. We take them wherever we go and 2. Touch screens/GUIs are excellent for emulating objects.<p>The power of the app, I think, is in emulating small things  not replacing dedicated, powerful tools.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4681135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4681135</a>",1351050801
4691565,comment,4691163,4691516,1,0,vubuntu,,,"StorSimple implements auto-tiering at block level and presents an iscsi target block device transparently to the OS/Filesystem layer. It is built on top of already available open source linux iscsi target software. If Fusion was done in similar manner, it absolutely does not require any modifications to the regular OS/file system layers at all. The intelligent auto-tiering capable iSCSI target portion would be at the driver level well isolated from the rest of the OS/filesystem components. It probably even has more simplistic rules for tiering . Keep OS files/dir always on SSD. Apply tiering logic to app data using a simplistic LRU scheme. And there is only two tiers to deal with. I am no expert in Linux/iSCSI or auto-tiering, but I bet you this is something that a HP/3PAR or Dell Compellent can spin up at a very short notice using their existing technologies. Apple is very good at identifying a complex ( and in most cases an existing but end-user un-friendly) technology that has been under-utilized in consumer space and bring it down to consumer level and deliver it in a consumer-friendly manner and put a wonderful marketing spin on it with cool terminology (Retina display, Fusion drive)and possibly even patent some arcane & obvious variations of the main theme.",1351050783

I've heard similar stories  involving non-trades union companies. I've also heard amazing success stories involving companies bought out of bankruptcy by their employees and turned into financial success stories. Guess it depends on the people involved.<p>One thing I can address is this:<p>"" Labour laws have protected the workforce from shady practices you experienced (arguably an isolated incident)""<p>In manufacturing and trades (especially trades) this isn't even slightly accurate. Laws don't protect people, they provide a theoretical framework for compensation or punitive action after the fact. In practice a private citizen has almost no chance against a corporate lawyer in court, so it's almost impossible to prove workplace safety violations. On the rare ocassion that something does stick in court companies caught violating worker safety laws typically get a slap on the wrist, meanwhile whistleblowers better have a spare career up their sleeves or line up a settlement big enough to retire on because they 
won't be working for any outfits in their industry once they pull the trigger on a court case. Good luck proving the last company you interviewed you didn't hire you because you blew the whistle on your last employer. :/",1351050696

    In a single step process, room temperature magnesium alloy chips are fed into the
    back end of a heated barrel through a volumetric feeder. The barrel is maintained
    under an argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the magnesium chips. A screw feeder
    located inside the barrel feeds the magnesium chips forward as they are heated into 
    the semi-solid temperature range. The screw rotation provides the necessary shearing
    force to generate the globular structure needed for semi-solid casting. Once enough 
    slurry has accumulated, the screw moves forward to inject the slurry into a steel die.

In my experience some of the approaches to frugality can quickly become counterproductive and eat away critically needed development clock cycles.<p>Here's an concrete example:  I made due for years with cobbled-together CNC equipment of various kinds.  I bought an old Bridgeport CNC mill really cheap.  Within a month of use the spindle transmission had to be rebuilt.  It did not have an automatic tool changer or tool probing.  After that I took a Bridgeport knee mill and converted it to CNC.  No tool changer or tool probe.  It did OK.  Both of these represented HUGE time drains and detracted from the main mission in major ways.<p>Later on I decided to do it right and leased a Haas VF6-SS.  If I remember correctly the lease ran about $2,000 per month.  Best decision I ever made.  All of a sudden CNC was not a research project.  The thing just worked and it could work 24/7 if required.  It had an automatic tool changer and automatic tool probing.  When properly married to Solidworks and a CAM program the setup was smooth as silk.  This improvement in productivity was well worth the $2,000 per month and other costs (tooling, setup, training) in that it quickly returned everyone to being focused on what we were actually trying to design rather.  It also opened-up design possibilities that did not exist before this machine arrived due to what was lacking on the cobbled-up machines (fourth axis being one example).<p>That's not to say that I am not for being frugal and creative whenever possible.  For example, we used the CNC machine to manufacture custom assembly tooling that would have cost tens of thousands of dollars to purchase.  We also made our own sub-table for the machine and saved tons of money.",1351048594

But I'm starting with comments from the top of tree though.<p>> I guarantee there's no way that the Windows WM is ""more flexible"" than any linux WM.<p>The new version of Nautilus is competitive for being less flexible!<p>> I assume you have workspaces in Windows?<p>I personally never used workspaces, I prefer alt-tab.  When I have 2+ monitors workspaces seem clunky and just another layer of tab switching with different buttons.  Monitors have gotten big, cheap, and plentiful enough that the original use case of workspaces is falling by the wayside.  Not saying the option to use them is bad, just that I have no use for them personally, for the reasons above.<p>> It's consistent. It's been consistent for 7 iterations. 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.<p>The original explorer.exe was a wrapper on the DOS terminal and would regularly crash when trying to open something because the kernel wasn't preemptive.  Wasn't really consistent UX at all.  The old Windows 9X everything was always buggy, blue screen prone, and crash happy.  The introduction of Aero in Vista also significantly changed a lot of the WM UX (start menu search, layout, composting, etc).  The changing the of the start bar to a pinnable dock in 7 was also a pretty radical shift.<p>> Consistent + Stable = Win<p>I'd argue consistency doesn't matter as much in Linux world, because you can just use an old WM if you like it more than a new one.  And if you like it more, it is probably stable.  If it starts breaking, someone will probably fork it.<p>> It's the driver availability, quality, and support. And that, of course, comes from market dominance.<p>I haven't found many devices in recent memory that don't have some Linux support without the manufacturer going out of their way to obfuscate the implementation.  A lot of people put in a ton of effort to make hardware work under Linux that the manufacturers don't care to properly document.<p>> They're all drag-and-dropable, they're all resizeable.<p>I get <i>really</i> annoyed in a lot of Linux WMs / DEs because of how they don't support drag and drop on the panel / launcher.  XFCE requires writing obfuscated launchers, for example.  I could get into why I'm not implementing that feature myself, but the intricacies of X drag and drop are something I don't have the patience or intelligence to dig into.<p>> You are restricted to hardware that works on your operating system of choice.<p>Windows won't run on a raspberry pi, anything based on powerPC, ARM (at least in a functional version, Windows RT is a trainwreck in my book by branding alongside Win8 without x86 emulation).  If you are arguing that traditional laptop / desktop manufacturers are making sure their devices work with the pre-installed OS, color me shocked.<p>I never got on board with the crusade to make Linux run on every piece of hardware ever, because I think that is giving hardware manufacturers too much credit.  Trying to reverse engineer everything is basically giving them a pass on making devices that don't work the way they are intended.  If they don't want to give the kernel devs even the crumbs to replicate functionality, just telling people that company is an asshole is plenty in my book.  There is nothing beholden to an OS to support everything you can plug into a usb port, even though it is neat when a wiimote works.<p>> I buy any hardware I want, with the full knowledge that it will work properly on Windows the way the manufacturer intended. Even Apple, the only major manufacturer out there that doesn't make hardware targeted at Windows, puts out drivers for Windows.<p>I have had <i>plenty</i> of printer / NIC / sound card driver issues under Windows, even in 7.  Software doesn't suddenly become bug free, especially complex software like an OS, just because it has profit motive behind it.<p>>  So Linux doesn't run on specific hardware that require hand crafted drivers from the manufacturer. Off topic much? We were talking about consistency of window mangers.<p>The argument devolved into Windows vs Linux when it is apples and oranges.  Microsoft is a for profit company that incentivises you buying their OS (either prebundled or in a box) and Linux could care less, even though Ubuntu / Red Hat like supporting you for money when you use it.  But Linux is developed because OSS developers want a desktop they like (or a server, or a seismometer, or a robot..) and Windows is developed to be sold to you.  Different use cases.<p>> Again, you've listed NOTHING about the Windows WM that you are ""used to"" or is ""particularly consistent"". Because, you and I both know what those things will be and that most Linux DEs have the exact same configuration.<p>Some things I like about the Windows desktop:<p>Windows don't randomly open in strange places (a lot of gtk apps have a habit of launching half off screen depending on prevous resizing, Evince does it a lot).  Windows has GUI based kernel hooks to recover from a bad process (if I want to do the equivalent of ctrl-alt-del in Linux, I need to switch off X to a TTY and try fixing it from the terminal, because there is no Gnome based (to my knowledge, at least) way to override a fullscreen openGL application that crashes, ex: Space Pirates and Zombies, recently).<p>The system tray in Windows is a lot easier to work with since you can select options right from it, rather than through system settings in some Gnome desktops, and I still don't know how to configure it under Cairo Dock, Docky, Cinnamon, or XFCE.<p>Windows had a really nice out of the box behavior where I could just stick the taskbar on the left side of the screen and have the entire screens worth of vertical space available.  In something like Firefox, that would mean the maximized app would have tabs in the title bar, so I had an entire 1080 pixels of Firefox, and on a 16:9 monitor that is really useful.  I still can't find a WM that lets Firefox (I think Chrome can do it in some) do the tabs in the title bar thing.  I figure it wouldn't even be hard - I could imagine a WM just giving the application whatever space the title bar occupies to work with, with some statistics about where the navigation buttons are, so it can control the transparency and draw in the title bar as well, and just avoid those buttons.  That was a tangent.  Also not going to try to get that implemented in Muffin / Mutter or whatever, because it sounds hard.<p>Anywho, only KDE seems to allow the same UX (vertical panel on left with system tray, time, etc, built in, letting applications have the entire vertical pixels for the rest of the screen, with a panel like pinnable launcher bar, and they don't have neat mouseovers like Windows has previews of open windows or system controls).<p>Alt tab is nicer in Windows (even though some Compiz active corner effects are neat in Unity / Cinnamon with whatever they replaced Mendacity with I don't even remember now) since it shows the open Windows.  Cinnamon has a smart corner that intelligently fills the screen with active windows though, which is also really cool.  But alt-tab in Unity / Gnome (by default at least, I have even tried reading a bunch of manuals on these desktops and I still don't know 5% of potential configurations) just shows icons.<p>Another thing is the super-key behavior, Windows does it really well with the ability to just type and enter commands, or have a dynamic search that is intelligent by remembering your history, recent files, etc.  Unity is similar, Gnome 3 is close, and KDE is close too, but respectively, Unity and Gnome have terrible / almost no configuration and dumb top bars as a result and KDE is slow as hell (at least on startup, but it even lags my i7 920 on some of its composting).<p>I do use Linux almost full time now - I have been transitioning off Windows for the last ~6 months, since Steam was announced on Ubuntu.  I got SC2 / TF2 / League running under Wine since then, so I don't have any real reason to restart in Windows (except Darksiders 2 for a fwe weeks, that game was amazing and I'm too dumb to create custom Wine environments and find all the DLLs it needs without a playonlinux script).<p>Woo, wall of text.",1351048321

I just looked up the Librian of Congress's 2010 DMCA statement, where it is stated that one of the classes works which qualify for exception from the no disabling DRM clause of the DMCA is:<p>""Literary works distributed in ebook format when all existing ebook editions of the work (including digital text editions made available by authorized entities) contain access controls that prevent the enabling either of the books read-aloud function or of screen readers that render the text into a specialized format.""<p>I suspect that it is in error, but this excemption does not specify that the reason for disabling DRM is to use it for one of the mentioned purposes, only that stripping DRM would be nessasary for the mentioned purposes. The lack of enforcement probably makes this a moot point, but if all of a e-book's versions have DRM, and you get in trouble for stripping the DRM off, this would probably hold up as a solid technicality.<p>Granted, it is still illegal to distribute software designed to aid people in lawfully stripping DRM from e-books.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-1201-Statement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2010/Librarian-of-Congress-120...</a>",1351047741

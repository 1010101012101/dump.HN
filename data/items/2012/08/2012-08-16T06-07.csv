'nothing to download'? I don't ever have to download to watch a video on youtube. Grooveshark let's me listen without downloading or signing up.
No search is great if the user can find what they're looking for, but I don't feel like you've nailed that yet.<p>I'll have to disagree with you on design. Core functionality  isn't functional if people don't use it. Design is not decoration. Think UX not UI. It is hugely important to the success of your start-up. I know. I created a site that people raved about the design and was growing nicely. I redesigned it to add some 'functionality' I thought people would appreciate, and people hated the new design and that growth came to a halt.<p>Good luck with the UX, my suggestion is still to stick to something people are familiar with, don't go re-inventing the wheel.",1345100358

4390219,comment,4385969,4389367,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The literature on what is called ""greedy routing"" is a great place to start. I intuitively knew about these interactions for years while designing parallel and distributed systems before I read the formal literature. The literature was very educational.<p>What is interesting about the literature on designing systems with robustly stable and efficient network behaviors is how restrictive the known solutions to this problem are in terms of how a protocol must be designed. At the same time, it is enlightening to realize that every robust large-scale distributed system employs the mathematics pervasively. Email spam is a predictable failure mode for the SMTP protocol per the mathematics, once you start thinking about it that way.<p>The most important counter-intuitive idea is that robust distributed protocols are subtractive. You can't design a distributed system around creating good properties per se, you can only design a distributed system that suppresses bad properties. An optimal distributed protocol is one in which the various well-known pathologies are naturally and effectively suppressed by the behavior of the protocol without suppressing aggregate throughput.",1345100130

The search also turned up that you are interested in the topic of rape in general and discuss it across the internet. I have no interest in your general interest in the topic of rape, but I do want to point out that your claims about Assange are bald faced lies and you have an agenda.<p>It would be one thing if you had heard in passing that the women had accused him of rape and he was being charged with rape and mistakenly thought it was correct. But you have a  history of promoting these claims and during this time have not provided evidence either that he has been charged with rape or that either woman has claimed to have been raped. Thus you do know what the facts are, and you are intentionally choosing to lie here. There is nothing innocent about your assertions and your propaganda tactics are far from naive.<p>Your comments about ""rape cases"" where people blame the victims, ""intimidate them from testifying"" and engage in ""character assassination"" are more of your attempts to falsely promote and assert that these women have said they were raped and that he was been charged with rape, but then adds on a new accusation - there is a conspiracy to harm them  right here on Hacker News! Who here is intimidating them from testifying? Name them! Rape has not been accused by the women or charged, so there is no rape case. There is no character assassination against the women to repeatedly ask you to show your evidence that rape has been charged, or that the women have accused him of rape. Cite specifically the character assassination that has occurred here. Show your evidence. Asking you to provide evidence of your claims is not character assassination against women, nor is it blaming victims, nor is it intimidating witnesses in a trial, and it is absurd rhetoric to claim these things.",1345100122

No, because in the case of Assange, the idea that he's some kind of political prisoner subject to a CIA plot lies somewhere between conspiracy theory and delusion of grandeur, while in the case of Chinese dissidents, it would be plainly transparent what China was trying to do.<p>Plus, it turns out that China gets their dissidents to stop hiding out in western embassies by threatening to beat their wives to death.

I simply think the Swedish justice system should fully process these accusations, and whatever outcome or verdict is reached will simply be whatever it is.<p>I am dismayed that in many rape cases, it's easier to perform a character assassination on the alleged victims and intimidate them from testifying. I'm worried that people with some sort of political sympathy for Assange due to his work with WikiLeaks will engage in this kind of character assassination and intimidation. Fortunately, the Swedish prosecutors seem to have collected depositions already, so Assange's alleged victims might not have to go through the agony of reliving their experiences on a worldwide stage only to be called liars or sluts, or to be accused of being paid off by the CIA.<p>Still, there's a very high chance that even if Assange is guilty, he will not be convicted.

These generalizations allow for individual exceptions, of course, but they are true in an important statistical sense. They allow us to predict that, for example, most top basketball players, powerlifters, and sprinters will be men. Indeed, it's no coincidence that the recently completed Olympics had separate competitions not only for physically disabled athletes (the Paralympics), but also for women. They could not in general compete otherwise.<p>Returning to your point, I doubt you really believe that it's meaningless to talk in terms of ""what women want"".

4390103,comment,4387127,4389018,18,0,mbenjaminsmith,,,"#3 is just wrong.<p>These guys <i>want</i> to make video games. Maybe that's enough to make it work and maybe not. Time will tell. But by the logic of #3 we should all just do whatever puts money in the bank. That argument quickly devolves into a lot of would-be entrepreneurs sulking back to jobs they vowed they would learn to live without or building companies that are temporary money making opportunities, not something worth the devotion required.<p>Most importantly, these kids are making games with <i>traction</i> -- 200k downloads in a week is very, very good, especially since they don't seem to be that focused on actually marketing their games. That means they've got some special sauce. Tweaking what they have to bring up conversions is a solvable problem. Finding pizza money is a solvable problem.<p>If they're broke and people are playing their games then that means their customer acquisition costs are basically zero (since they don't have any money for it anyway). They don't have to get conversions up that far to turn an acceptable profit (especially since these guys apparently live on peanuts).<p>""You're competing for the business of toxic people who hate paying money"" -- that's simplistic to say the least. I don't want to bother to dig up numbers but plenty of money is spent on games on mobiles and everywhere else. If you want to generalize that way you might say that about the whole mobile ""app"" market and the drive towards free or $.99 -- people expecting a lot for nothing -- yet it's still a thriving industry. If you're talking about the freemium or f2p model (in apps or games) it's not like the concept was invented by Zynga. The fact that freemium works was <i>discovered</i> -- it's a model the market supports and supports well.<p>""Well-funded corporations (which have high production values and effective, ruthless monetization)"" -- high production values, especially on mobile where AAA graphics and open, 3D worlds aren't possible or even desirable, is not the issue it is on the consoles and PCs. Plenty of successful games are relatively simple 2D and have limited content. High production values in those cases can be measured in thousands of dollars, not millions. Ruthless monetization? What difference does that make in terms of competition, especially since we're talking about ""well-funded corporations?""<p>If you're not that familiar with the market, pick up a big EA title and then play something like Tiny Wings. Which one was more fun? What do you think their comparative budgets were?<p>The ""big corporations"" -- EA et al I guess you mean -- were slow to move to this newest mobile market and have had a hard time making games people really like. They make up for it with marketing spend, but it's not like people aren't playing games like Tiny Wings because they can't pull themselves away from Mass Effect: Infiltrator.<p>If you mean mobile publishers like Chillingo et al then there's absolutely nothing stopping these guys from having a publisher like that pick up their game. There are pros and cons to doing so, but I doubt these guys would have any problem finding a publisher with the number of d/l they're getting.<p>""And amateur hobbyist artistes (who have ""that vision thing"" and are willing to starve to deliver it for free)."" -- I'm not sure who these people are, but if you mean part-time developers flooding the market with low quality, free games, that only hinders visibility in the app stores. App store visibility as a sales tool was a fluke of the birth of these app stores and is now gone, never to return (although people are still seeing those effects in the Android markets). The amateur, as in most markets, has very little effect on the market as a whole.<p>If you're talking about developers with vision -- say the developers of Braid or World of Goo or say Notch -- these people don't work for free or hurt the industry. I'd say they elevate the entire state of the industry and turn <i>more</i> people onto games.<p>These guys should definitely learn the business side of what they're doing but it sounds like they <i>absolutely should not</i> stop making games.",1345096972
4390102,comment,4387498,4388416,2,0,thirdsun,,,"I am from germany and grew up in the former DDR - however I can clearly see the difference between a government secretly using extensive surveillance to control people and a feature in a service that everyone is free to opt-out of (street view, not facebook photo tags - you should really have to opt-in to the latter). My argument is not about agreeing or disagrreing with street view though. I'm just disappointed with the widespread misinformation that surrounded the whole issue - some people literally assumed that street view would be a live feed into their homes. The media should have done a better job at educating people.<p>Generally there is a lot of bias against Google over here. This goes as far as publishers and newspapers heavy lobbying for a law that would force Google to pay for indexing content excerpts in Google News. And they almost got away with it. Of course as a publisher you were able to configure how and if Google should index your content (Headline only, headline + excerpt, full content or no indexing at all). However as you can imagine publishers weren't interested in that but preferred Google to pay for referring users to their content. It's insane.<p>The picture of Google that is painted here doesn't feel fair at all. Of course it's ok to disagree with Google's data collecting behaviour - you're free to use alternative services, there are enough options. But selling targeted ads simply is their business. Think about the alternative: Let's assume Google didn't collect that data - they still need to display ads though. Ads are still ads, but now they are a lot less relevant to you and simply guessing what you might be interested in.",1345096935

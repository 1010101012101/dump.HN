2803056,comment,2803046,2803046,1,0,winternett,,,"Here's the original TXT in case the server gets overloaded:<p>People don't call each other anymore. Well, my parents call their friend circle on cell phones all the time but people in my generation (30 somethings) don't have endless talk sessions on phones like we once used to. What are so called ""youngsters"" doing?! They're using the Internet. FaceBook, G+, Soundcloud, Spotify, Web Sites, Texting, Twitter, Email, You name it... So why, in this great age of Internet progress and innovation, are we placing limits on bandwidth? Why does your phone mysteriously slow down or why does your bill balloon every month when you're just tyring to use the new features on your iPhone? A shocking expose awaits you below!:<p>I ventured out into the wild last week, once my BlackBerry suddenly died, and went to pursue a new wireless device. The hunt made me prey, and I came out with scratches of a higher bill, a more expensive phone, and a new thing called a ""data cap"" on Internet service for my phone.<p>Now, not many people are aware of data caps, especially because of cell phone plans being sold and advertised as ""unlimited"". Its a funny thing, but pretty much every new cell phone service contract (Except for those on Sprint Mobile) here in the US includes a ceiling for how much Internet service you can use on you phone. Some service providers even go as far as to sell you a plan, and not let you know that you will hit an ugly patch of inactivity, or a high bill if you pass that Internet data ceiling.<p>I am all for capitalism, because it drives innovation, and I'm all for newer devices with convenient and great new features like Wi-Fi and app downloads. I like apps, I develop apps, and I love me some good Internet. I firmly believe that the future of Internet Service Providers will be cell phone service providers, but we've really started out on a bad foot here with this type of data cap rate limiting. Let me first give you a bit of the back story:<p>I originally had a BlackBerry Bold. Due to hearing about the slump that company is currently in, some terrible people had convinced me to get an Android phone. I held out for over 6 months, until my BlackBerry started exhibiting signs of cardiac arrest during tethering and a tiny screen that made it quite hard to read most content of relevance to me online. I naturally started browsing new phones, and began to like one of the new devices out, The Sensation from HTC, its design was simple, and the screen much bigger than an iPhone 4's, I have no complaints about the device other than its outrageously poor battery life.<p>OK, so while shopping many different claims and representations were made to me in T-Mobile stores, often conflicting, I was quite surprised to see that there was a huge difference in price quotes between each store I went to. Ultimately, I saved 150$ off of the price I was originally quoted for the phone. The phone price is only 50% of the bargain though, just as, if not more important is the plan that I get for the phone. At the time, I had T-Mobile's ""unlimited"" plan for BlackBerry Data, my total monthly bill was around 84$ (don't ask me how the taxes and fees got the price up to there, even they can't explain that to me).<p>I of course had to start a new 2 year commitment for this phone (HTC sensation), along with 10 dollars more for the new ""Android data plan"" because it uses different Internets than a BlackBerry I guess, and a few extra fees because the unlimited plan had been updated. Reps at T-Mobile were all too eager to tell me my 2 year old BlackBerry unlimited plan was ""Grandfathered"" making it the youngest grandfather to ever exist I guess.<p>What I gave up by switching plans, was my ability to have a phone without data caps. That is the essence of having a grandfathered plan, despite years of being a loyal T-Mobile customer, my bill went up by over 30$ and they offered 5$ off, but having a data cap was such a significant sacrifice now because just 1 week after leaving the store with a new phone, my rate limit had been exceeded. Every Internet-Based service on my phone became extremely slow, if not non-functional once my data cap was passed, and the applications I develop on Internet Based services are now inaccessible. I also have to wait until next month before being able to view any post on Reddit past those with plain text because the wait is excruciatingly long and dysfunctional. I cannot also use the brilliant wi-fi hotspot feature that my all-new phone has because that makes my usage disappear immediately once I watch a few YouTube clips. My phone is now a paperweight unless I plan on calling or texting someone, which we don't really do anymore.<p>Let me tell you about what happens when you exceed this ""rate limit""! You basically drop on your stunning new 4G! phone to 2G! speed on T-Mobile. This makes your phone a paperweight, it seems functionally slower than a 56k modem, it reminds you about the dark ages, and the worst part is you're still paying a premium rate monthly to your wireless provider because T-Mobile charges 30$ for the next-level upgrade to 10GB, and there are no other options currently past that. I am paying about 98$ per month for less than a half a month of Internet Service, and there are no options to have full freedom on T-Mobile or AT&T. Some service providers charge you after the overage, Sprint is currently the only carrier to have an option for truly unlimited data plans at the moment, but they didn't have the phone I wanted.<p>Comcast has also implemented data caps on their local/home/business service in the North Eastern US, their limits work much in this same way. Your voice over IP calls will suddenly not work so great. You'll have to skip that night when you invite friends over to watch a new NetFlix movie because your data cap is exceeded (because your kids watched a really long Disney movie while you were at work). This has really significant implications that we won't realize until after its commonplace, and when we have no choice of reverting to a time of truly unlimited Internet.<p>As the Internet grows, so do bandwidth needs. How can we place limits on bandwidth in a society we want to grow? Why has Verizon tore up the street outside of my house to install Fiber Optic Cables if they're only going to allow me to download a few web sites and a short film each month? Where are consumer rights, competition, and fundamental fairness in this discussion? This year the US Supreme Court, in review of a case with Wal-Mart, set a precedent that makes it harder for consumers to file class-action lawsuits, you see the direction in which we're going here? Consumer satisfaction is the first thing to go in bad economies, actually its a leading key performance indicator of how well an economy is doing; based on the wireless industry, this is not a good sign for out economic outlook.<p>I don't know about you, but this is a pretty frickin' scary trend to me! I see a world in a few months where you pay a premium for Internet service yet you will have a harsh cut-off in service at a certain point each month (during your peak points in productivity) that will cripple you. Data Caps are hardly a desirable feature for customers of mobile service providers, but they continue to be enforced by service providers as proof that the benefit of competition in the industry is failing due to posturing and positioning of companies. This will only get worse as AT&T and Verizon buy out most of the smaller providers. There will suddenly only be 2 competitors that dictate the price and limits on service we (as consumers) will have to deal with.<p>The Internet was founded on the principle of being free, this changed in the late 90s with ISPs charging hourly, we caved. The Internet was born around the ideal of being open, but Google and FaceBook kind of killed that, we caved once again. The Internet was built on the principle of being without boundaries, throttling, and limits, lets not cave to mobile and Internet Service Providers putting data caps on our Internet usage. If we do, the only points of view you get will be provided by large corporations, encouraging you to pay a premium for limited access.",1311608777

2803053,comment,2801888,2801888,2,0,ForrestN,,,"Interesting idea! Definitely could be useful, as others have said, once you get enough listings. Some design/UX feedback to think about if you do decide to take it further:<p>- First, biggest problem: I visit the site and I have no idea what it's for. The name doesn't help in this respect. SplashActive makes me think of some sort of aquatic physical therapy for the elderly. Consider changing the name, but even if you don't, have a big, visible, prominent explanation (at least for first-time visitors) that's easy and fast to read and that explains exactly what I can get from the product.<p>- The individual listing template is a major weakness. Functionally, the information you've included on the bottom line of each listing is very hard to read because the only thing separating the labels from the values is that the labels are bold. If I were searching for just the phone number, for example, it would be somewhat annoying to find it. Aesthetically, the listings feel extremely bare and boring, and I'm demotivated from continuing to read them. Definitely incorporate photos wherever possible, and make each listing larger. I would group the information currently running along the bottom into a vertical list, with the labels much more clearly differentiated from the content, and the description a smaller, tighter paragraph that doesn't stretch so long.<p>- Provide some feedback when I mouseover the title of the listings that reenforces that they are links.<p>- I agree with the comment that suggests removing the advertising bar. Not only does an empty advertising bar make you look weak/amateur, you already have a built-in revenue model that doesn't rely on regular advertising. Paid featured listings are more valuable if they are integrated into the site and just made more prominent. If they're set aside in a sidebar that we're trained to ignore, they don't work as well and you can't charge as much for them. They also dilute the experience of the site.<p>- More padding in most of your tables. It looks awkward when text is jammed up against the border of a box<p>- Maybe it's more popular in the UK, but Bing Maps looks pretty awful. I'd switch to Google Maps.<p>- My city shows up as a link on the front page in default blue, directing to what looks like a profile page even though I haven't made an account. Change the link color, and maybe prompt me to register or login if there's no session. Also, fix the spacing on this profile page, and hide the ""My Activities"" label if there's nothing there.<p>- While you're still getting started, why not post a message to users who are sufficiently distant from where you are saying that you're currently testing just in this market, and that if they want to request a new area for you to offer your service, they can leave the suggestion and their email to be notified. You can also redirect them to a portal for your town so they can see what the service is and what your offerings are. It's strange, right now, to see a big listing of things 4000 miles away.<p>- Put another link to register on the login page.<p>- Make the logo a link to the home page.<p>- The green color you're using is very subdued and moody for what you're doing. I like the idea of green, but choose a palette that feels active, energetic, and positive. Dark forest green, grey, and white don't say ""fun in the sun.""<p>- Eventually, you'll want to break things up into at least a few categories. Right now, it's not clear what makes something a ""Top Activity"", and the only other sorting option I have is to see what's recently been added, which doesn't seem that helpful either. Think through what someone using the service to find an activity will be thinking about and using to make their decision. Facilitate their search and make it as fast and easy as possible.<p>Keep up the good work!",1311608719

C came forward in the 1970s because Bell Labs designed it for Unix for word whacking and wanted everything to run on an 8 KB machine or some such.  At the time, IBM's PL/I ran fine on a 128 KB 360 Model 40, but then 128 KB was in every sense a LOT bigger than 8 KB.  Also, at the time, writing a PL/I compiler was considered expensive, say, $40 million or more.  That later PL/I got handled for quite modest funding was a surprise.<p>Due to anti-trust issues, Bell couldn't sell Unix so essentially just gave it away.  Many universities got DEC computers and ran Unix.  So, a lot of students learned C.  C has a lot of problems with some traditional solutions given pointers, 'structures' of some kind, dynamic memory allocation, and 'entry' variables.  Then C++ was just a pre-processor to C to make more definite these traditional solutions.  Alas, both the syntax and the semantics of C++ are a mess.<p>C, and still C++, were, in a word, cheap.  When Bell did C, and then C++, it was considered that implementing anything like PL/I would be far too expensive.  PL/I has a much better collection of lessons for progress than C does.  That C got so popular and PL/I was largely forgotten was a sad day for practical computing.  Object oriented programming?  It's easy enough with PL/I as it is, and, really, in part or whole, long was popular before C++.  But that object oriented programming got to be mostly C++ built as a pre-processor to C instead of drawing from the lessons of PL/I (and more, e.g., Algol) was sad.<p>Net, for me, PL/I is much, much better than C and, still, even if want to use 'objects', better than C++.<p>But I didn't go into any of this with the recruiter at all.  Such a description would have been considered too long and arrogant.<p>Net, Google is bending their arm all out of shape patting themselves on their back telling themselves that they are eager to hire Michelangelo to paint their ceiling but are using at best house painters to do the recruiting.  There is a wide range between house painters and Michelangelo that Google doesn't know how to recruit.  It won't work, and it doesn't work.<p>Google is violating a simple rule in technical recruiting:  Under no circumstances should anyone in 'recruiting' or HR have any technical communications at all with a candidate.  None.  Zip, zilch, zero.  The recruiting and HR people can schedule phone calls and visits, help with coffee, tea, water or soft drinks, explain where the restroom is, hand out the benefits packet, smile, be nice, ask what they can do to help, help with plane and hotel reservations, help with car rental, make getting reimbursed easy, etc.  But technical?  NEVER!<p>Any technical communications have to be limited to the management chain and, really, some other processes.<p>There is a fundamental problem:  The need and the goal is to hire people who know things that some or all of the company so far does not know, or has capabilities the company does not have.  So, that broad idea that the company will look down and 'examine' the candidate on material the company does not understand is fundamentally hopeless.  Can't work.  There are ways to select experts, but anything like the Google process is hopeless.<p>In particular, that book as ""preparation"" is an insult to any employee who would bring something new to Google.<p>Google believes that they are high up and looking down.  That they are worth $195 billion, they are.  Technically, especially in their recruiting, they are not.<p>This thread is not about me; it's about Google's recruiting.  My experience is relevant only as a source of data I do have about their recruiting.  Again, it's Google's recruiting, not me.",1311608285

People are important, but they can only stick around as long as there is funding. (Of course, funding depends heavily on social networks, so in that sense the people are important.)

The monopoly rent from a patent is supposedly the only way to encourage firms to do R&D, to innovate rather than copy.<p>And aren't patents getting stronger based on case law?  The i4i vs Microsoft thing re-affirmed quite a strict standard as to patent validity. I know it's nothing compared to how copyrights are being made stronger and stronger, but still, patents are being made stronger.<p>Shouldn't we be seeing <i>more</i> innovation on that basis? There's a general trend towards strong ""intellectual property"" protections, and Big Pharma has been the industry pushing that kind of thing pretty hard.<p>So where's the real problem?  Big Pharma R&D not working, FDA getting irrational about approvals, Big Pharma coasting for the past N years? Biology research has hit the limits of what it can do?",1311606213

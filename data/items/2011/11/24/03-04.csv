At the time, we committed to maintaining the site at least through to the end of 2010. Today, we are sharing the specific dates for ending this maintenance period and shutting down Wave. As of January 31, 2012, all waves will be read-only, and the Wave service will be turned off on April 30, 2012. You will be able to continue exporting individual waves using the existing PDF export feature until the Google Wave service is turned off. We encourage you to export any important data before April 30, 2012.<p>If you would like to continue using Wave, there are a number of open source projects, including Apache Wave. There is also an open source project called Walkaround that includes an experimental feature that lets you import all your Waves from Google. This feature will also work until the Wave service is turned off on April 30, 2012.<p>For more details, please see our help center.<p>Yours sincerely,<p>The Wave Team",1322107084

But deletion discussions aren't really one of them.<p>Deciding what really fits in an encyclopedia isn't simple. Wikipedia has spent literally a decade working out a set of rules that balances utility, fairness, quality, and maintainability. Those rules will inevitably seem bureaucratic and opaque to people who haven't worked on a number of articles and then really considered the problem.<p>Deletion discussions are perennial magnets for non-participants who believe that they or their (friend|band|ancestor|website) belong in Wikipedia. They are inevitably upset. Worse, in Pauli's phrase, they aren't even wrong: they start with the premise the article should be kept and then say whatever they think will let them win.<p>In this case, the bloggy ranter doesn't get basic Wikipedia fundamentals. E.g. that Wikipedia isn't about what's <i>true</i>, it's about what's <i>verifiable</i>[1]. Suppose he thinks that his pal is the most important person ever. He might be right, but what matters is what can be proven from reliable sources[2].<p>Making deletion review more approachable to the personally outraged would certainly increase the number of reviews, but it wouldn't materially change the number of articles kept. What it would do is waste a lot of valuable editor and admin time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:V</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS</a>",1322106983

Right now the tablet game really comes down to Apple, Barnes & Noble and Amazon. (The Nook, which has sold literally orders of magnitude more units than the TouchPad, isn't even being counted.)<p>But the report wants to reassure PC manufacturers that, somehow, that they are still in the hunt.<p>From TFA:<p>""Including the iPad makes statements like this, from NPD, seem absurd:<p><i>PC manufacturers are dominant in the tablet space, as four of the top five tablet brands already have a strong U.S. consumer PC presence. Only two of the top five brands play in the smartphone market.</i><p>NPD is trying to paint a picture that theres a contest going on where there is none. I repeat the following from their report:<p><i>76 percent of consumers who purchased a non-Apple tablet didnt even consider the iPad, an indication that a large group of consumers are looking for alternatives, and an opportunity for the rest of the market to grow their business.</i><p>Thats one way to put it. Another way is that 92 percent of U.S. tablet buyers considered an iPad, and 89 percent bought an iPad, which means 97 percent of tablet buyers who merely considered an iPad bought an iPad, and if not for the 8 percent of tablet buyers who for whatever reason did not consider an iPad, none of these companies would have sold even 100,000 tablets over the first nine months of 2011.""",1322106674

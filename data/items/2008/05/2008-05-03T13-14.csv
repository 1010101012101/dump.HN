180232,comment,179338,180166,0,0,greatapps,,,"How disappointing that your only contribution to this discussion is to be snide and rude. I've offered an opinion about an application and the utility I derived on my blog. Thereafter I've commented on the price offered for a company.  By definition these are subjective matters.  Isn't the point of this forum is for you to articulate where you differ and why, rather than offering childish playground insults.",1209822826
180231,comment,179911,179911,0,0,edw519,,,"Maybe this thinking makes sense on the larger sites, but for here, it just sounds stupid.<p>I have often wondered how this ""organism"" call the Hacker News community works and have finally satisfied myself by not even thinking about it any more.<p>I often find what I think is the coolest article and wonder what others will think.  So I submit it and it sits there with no comments or upvotes.<p>Did I submit it at a bad time?  Or a bad day?  Were all the people who would have liked it busy doing something else?  What time was it in Europe?  In California?  In New York?  Did I submit it while there was free beer and munchies at a Super Happy Dev House somewhere?  Was pg speaking somewhere?<p>Or maybe people just don't care about the same things I do sometimes.  (I suspect this is the most likely reason.)  But that's cool too, because that's still a good answer.<p>So instead of trying to understand the unimportant and elusive, it's probably a better idea to submit what we think is interesting and see what happens.  And comment when we have something to say and shut up when we don't.  And vote, too.  But mostly, use most of those cycles on our own startups and save hn for breaks.",1209822433

3631904,comment,3630626,3631851,4,0,wslh,,,"Obviously this is just one opinion from an Argentinian but I think there are only two lessons. The other economic analysis (GDP growth) are explained because the country came from a really strong recession (subzero situation), and the commodities rocketed sky-high while the agricultural sector improved a lot in terms of efficiency. The rest of things remains the same: an hyper-corrupt country, without justice (except when the government pushes for specific cases), with a lot of poor people and people living of social assistance handled by government lords in change of favors (votes).<p>Lessons for other countries:<p>- You can renegotiate your foreign obligations (what is happening in Greece). The default is not the end of the game.<p>- Stay away from IMF bureaucrats",1330135134

E.g., most startups fail. So unless we have some compelling reason to believe a project is a good idea, it is likely to be wasteful.<p><i>...but the real world is always more complicated.</i><p>This is a logical fallacy.

SMS is definitely not free to the carrier.<p>Also, from my understanding, they don't actually piggy-back on the control messages, at least not after they have entered the wired part of the system (I never worked in the over-the-air part of the system, so have no knowledge of what happens there). That is, even if the control messages were sent constantly, SMS messages don't get a free ride, but rather they share the bandwidth with the control messages, since those messages do not require near as much bandwidth as the voice channels do.<p>As an aside, one carrier we installed our system in could only handle a thousand or two messages per second tops, after that, messages were dropped (well, TCAP transactions meant they were re-transmitted later), so there isn't some magical unlimited bandwidth available to SMS messages.",1330135094
3631900,comment,3629909,3629909,3,0,j_baker,,,"I agree with the author, but for diametrically opposed reasons.  It's more that I don't think my web framework should decide that I need to be using MVC.  If I want to tightly couple my view logic to my model logic, that's my (and my team's) business.  If I want to drink the MVC Koolaid, that's my business as well.  It isn't the business of the person who wrote my framework.<p><i>It's much simpler to handle views and view logic in only one place, and that place is slowly moving away from the server side.</i><p>I see.

It seems quite useful in many cases.<p>One thing to keep in mind about PostgreSQL is you can do a lot of traditional middleware tasks (including message queues) in the database back-end with transactional control.  These can even be hooked into other applications\nRemember, you can put a lot of what would otherwise go in a middleware layer in the database itself, especially with features in PostgreSQL like LISTEN/NOTIFY.<p>There are some limitations of this approach, but in general, I have found it ideal, but it requires thinking about your database differently.  Instead of a data store on the bottom of the stack, you have an intelligent data storage and queuing system in the center of your environment.",1330135067

3631887,comment,3630011,3631777,2,0,drostie,,,"It is to me. I was very surprised that programmers pay ~$100-$200 for padded over-the-head headphones. Perhaps this is just ultra-typical. The styles are very interesting, although unfortunately they don't provide that data directly; the brands are also somewhat interesting.<p>Keep in mind, I say this as someone who is apparently quite atypical. I have converted to neckphones -- headphones which wrap around your neck while wearing them -- as things which occupy my permanent ensemble. It's partly because I wanted to be able to quickly drop and resume music listening while cycling, but to be honest the padded headphones feeling around my neck died in high school for me, and hasn't been resurrected. They were too sweaty and you couldn't really wear them around your neck comfortably and sleekly while you were in a situation where you wanted to pay attention. Thinner traditional headphones are good for that, earbuds are horrible for that.<p>I feel like the story is missing the details, though. I could write a blog I suppose about all the neckphones I've used and their relative advantages, but honestly it seems like my basic problem is ""I expect to accidentally sit on my headphones once or twice per year and they must be cheap, so that I think of them as expendable."" That's not really in this article. ^_^;; I've used Sennheisers, I have a pair of Sonys now, but I must remark that at least for neckphones, after several frustrating experiences with other brands my brand loyalty today belongs with Philips. So I am even more atypical; they don't make the graph <i>at all</i> here. ^_^;;<p>I feel some extra pride because it's a Dutch company, but still: the last Philips neckband headphones I bought, the SHS5200s, lasted me almost an entire year for (if I'm remembering this correctly) 15 euro, with beautiful sound that, unlike my present Sony's, didn't leak sound to my office mates. They ultimately wore down because they had a straight headphone jack, not an L-shaped one. (The headphone ports on both my old and newer laptop were/are on the front, and therefore fatigue the cord when I'm reclining with my laptop on evenings and weekends.)<p>The only reason I'm ranting about them, and I promise I'll stop, is that the SHS5200s actually solved the problem of cord-extension breaks. And it's retrospectively such a simple engineering fix: just don't make the audio wire load-bearing. Use a piece of elastic to ""bunch up"" a little bit of wire, when you accidentally hyperextend your cord, the elastic is what responds. It's a brilliant little thing.<p>The reason I'm saying all of this is just that, in my role as hacker, these are the little things which I value most. The sound quality needs to be pretty beautiful, yes, but there are other practical problems like being able to comfortably keep them around my neck when I'm walking around town.",1330134596

A similar thought occured to me; that like ""minimalist"" has been by a similar group of people, the word beautiful is being diluted of its meaning. Beauty's in the eye of the beholder, and I've never thought to use it to describe a UI, no matter how well thought out or suitable its colour scheme. Now very suddenly it's become the de jour adjective of a new generation of apps, along with ""delightful"", and I'm suspicious it's more based on fashions amongst the startup crowd and less on more objective realities.",1330134595

3631867,comment,3629803,3629803,2,0,evo_9,,,"Advertising needs to be turned upside in the DVR/Digital streaming era.  Imagine if the show you watched ran ad-free, and instead simply had a 'Sponsored By' section on the shows start page (basically a newly designed 'landing page' for each tv show). Then we viewers would simply choose to watch the ad's when we/if we wanted. And even if we didn't watch an ad, just seeing a Tide logo on that page would cause some to buy their product ('cool they sponsor Family Guy...' for example).<p>The thing that advertisers don't seem to understand is that we consumers are actually interested in the right ad's. I would choose to watch the new trailer for Game of Thrones - Season Two for example. Or an add for the new Honda Element, if I were shopping or just curious what the new model looked like.<p>All the sponsored by ads could be google-style customized to the viewer, and the view-rate would likely be higher than it is now where I DVR skip pretty much all ad's since there is no easy way for me to know what is being shown.<p>On top of all that, advertisers would be able to know exactly how many people were actually watching their ads.  They could even add in interactive 'like/dislike' voting to further determine the effectiveness of the ad.<p>I thought of all this 5-6 years ago when DVR's really got popular. It seemed to me an obvious way to 'evolve' TV, and I'm pretty surprised something like this hasn't already happend. I guess it's expecting too much from an industry that is used to just shoveling ads at us from all angles, the idea of 'choice' is probably pretty scary/imposible for them.<p>Maybe this is the way Apple intends to crack TV?",1330134127

3631865,comment,3630896,3630896,10,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I think Alexia is the only one left now. No offense but her stories were awful.<p>My theory is that TC got so popular because its value was similar to that of a Daily TV Show where we'd tune in everyday to hear from our favorite characters (Arington the ""villain"" and Alexia the ""girl we love to hate""). It wasn't just about the articles or the stories it was the editors and their take on it. We fell in love with watching them and their viewpoint, not necessarily staying up to date. Because there's lots of sites with up to date tech news, opinion pieces, and gadget reviews, many of which where much better than TCs content. But TC put a lot more emphasis on the editor and the personality they injected into their pieces. Even when they were wrong or biased we soaked it all up. Normal news shows have the editor stand behind their piece, almost invisible (which is the goal of journalism) but with TC the editors were proudly in front of their articles, you knew exactly who the article was from just by reading the first paragraph. It wasn't transparent at all. The focus wasn't the news, it was the editors themselves. The human element.<p>This furthers my theory that above all else, we are addicted to people. It's the human connection. Everywhere you look, social networks, online multiplayer, everything having to do with connecting people has grown immensely over the last few years. We emote by watching others emote, and we form opinions by listening to others' opinions. This is why Fox News has grown so much and why a lot of professional unbiased journalism has faded away. Because deep down inside we don't want ""balanced"" we don't want ""both sides of the story"" we want OUR side. When ""Journalists"" tell us what we want to hear we call them ""fair and balanced"" and are completely oblivious to their biases. And when their opinion didn't match ours we complain about the network or blog and call it biased, agenda driven, unfair, awful news, etc...<p>Psychologically, we don't want ""mom and dad"" telling us what to do and what to think, that's no fun. We want a fun loving neighbor that's just our age and does the same things we do and likes the same things we like. We also don't really want to be educated, doing so requires us to admit that we were wrong, or that we don't know something, and that we have to change our thinking. To seek education would mean that we admit that we are incorrect or inferior or stupid. We want our opinion to be validated. We want ""us"" to be validated.<p>We are looking for ourselves in everything (brands cater to us, news caters to us, video games caters to us, movies are whitewashed and stereotyped for us). Look very carefully at Tech Crunch, it had ""us"" all over it. Arrington the arrogant and dominating alpha male (what every man wants to be), Sarah Lacy the hip, globe trotting, educated girl we wish we knew, Alexia for the high school crowd, MG Siegler for the mac crowd, Jason Kincaid the awkward nice guy / best friend we never had, Paul Carr the opinionated smart guy, and so on and so on. TC wasn't news at all, it was a tech themed personal blog aggregate. Almost like a nonsexual dating site for techies. And it seduced us all, very, very well.<p>Of course, now that everyone knows it'll be very interesting to see what happens next, now that everyone knows the secret...",1330134059

Concepcion</i>.  AT&T had always put mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in its contracts but states (most notably CA) usually ignored them and allowed class actions to proceed.  In <i>Concepcion</i>, the Supreme Court said that the Federal Arbitration Act (an act that basically says promoting arbitration is so desirable any contract that calls for arbitration must be honored) preempts state law that would ignore those provisions.<p>In other words, the formula for becoming class action proof is now 1) insert mandatory arbitration provision; 2) insert class action waiver; 3) dare consumers to sue you one at a time.<p>Virtually the only way I see to overcome <i>Concepcion</i> right now is mass, coordinated (but individual), small claims suits or arbitrations.  If AT&T had to face several million suits where it was actually relatively easy to win $850, they'd be begging for the old class action system.",1330133205

Part of the problem is bad analogies: ""Demanding the private key to an encrypted volume is no different than demanding the combination to a safe"" or any other equivalent concept. If the defendant doesn't provide the combination to a safe than the blowtorches are coming out. At no point is his cooperation a _necessary condition_ to the gathering of evidence. However, to demand the defendant disclose the private key --or the more common ""we don't want the key, just what's inside"" demand-- is to require his cooperation. It is now a necessary condition that the defendant comply in order to gather this evidence. And as such, it becomes an invasion into the mind of the defendant for the purposes of coercing a confession.<p>Indeed, the judge could grant immunity to the defendant, thereby requiring him under law to ""testify"" his private key, but then you don't have a case to prosecute.

Enterprise costs a lot more than Home Premium.<p>I dont know who is doing your purchasing but through volume licensing enterprise pay significantly less per cal than a home user could ever hope of getting. Also enterprise tend to purchase MS support but home users do not.<p>>MS's stock hasn't moved in the past decade.<p>>>That's a sign of a mature company. They rake in a lot of money. They're no longer ""cool"" but they're a steady source of a lot of income. And unlike Apple, they actually pay dividends on their stock. [1]<p>While gangbuster growth is not usually sustainable flat earnings are not a sign of maturity they are a sign of stagnation. Without growth (real or expected) dividends are required to keep share holders happy. Also I am not sure its clear cut that dividends in general are a great thing.<p>>(and they're not anymore)<p>>>I'd like to see some numbers on this, because every number I've seen shows Microsoft in the mid 90% range for computer install base.<p>This only takes into account the desktop market which is quickly becoming less relevant than the mobile market where MS has no dominance and little growth. Even in the desktop market the user experience is shifting away from the OS to the web, again not a dominant area for MS.<p>>If MS could stream easily, people wouldn't be buying Roku boxes, Boxee boxes, PS3's.<p>>>And where are people streaming from?

Outlook and Excel are still killer apps but charging for access, or at least not making it part of the most basic bundles like word is did not do MS any favors.<p>>If MS had simply given away SQL server licenses, Apache would have never taken off.<p>>>Because if there's one thing Apache servers are known for, it's SQL (wtf is this?)<p>Agreed here I am not sure what the OP was referring to unless he means the power of the LAMP stack. Had microsoft had a competing offering that was not under such expensive licensing it would have given them a big bost in server licenses.<p>>Why am I shown different deals if i'm a home user, a small business user, a medium size business user, or a larger business user?<p>>>Because home users buy one computer. Businesses buy dozens or hundreds.<p>But this segmentation does not work if everyone can see every deal. You can achieve similar results based on volume discounting or segmentation along less artificial lines. For example as a home user I do not care if the same modle of PC will be guaranteed available for a 3 year life cycle. As a business customer I am willing to pay extra for that.<p>>Why are my computing needs different if I'm a small<p>>>business user vs. a medium size business user? Business machines need to be stable, supported, and perform well for the task they do. Home computers tend to be less stable, less supported, easier to break, but above all closer to bleeding edge and cheaper.<p>Home PC tend to fall into bleeding edge or cheap but reliability and support are just as important too the two groups. Delivery of service is different but expectations are the same. At the end of the day these are the same components and are used by users at work and at home. The reason consumerization of IT is hitting business hard is because users no longer have a difference in expectations between what they can do at home and what they can do at work.<p>>Why is it such a struggle for me to order a machine with an SSD and 16GB RAM?<p>>>Because you can't figure out how to read? Your mouse is broken? Monitor is unplugged? I don't know, you tell me.\nListen, complain all you want, but it makes sense from a business standpoint.<p>His point on 'What's the different between a ""vostro"" and an ""optiplex""and an ""inspiron"" and an ""xps""' is completely valid. What the hell do those mean and where do I even begin looking for what i want when these are the initial choice presented to me. To make matters worse I can configure near identical machines under these different lines but get vastly different prices. Now I need to configure my PC several different times and track that pricing to make an intelligent choice? That is insanity.<p>>>If you can't wrap your head what Microsoft is doing, just take a step back and realize that there are really only two options for Windows 7: Home and Professional.

First of all, you'd never mix or master on headphones unless you're testing to see how your mix sounds on headphones.  So at that point, you probably want cans that translate well to ""average"" headphones, and it may well be that the Sonys do.  Think about NS-10's, or even Auratones - they're not great speakers, they're just a common reference point that everyone knows.<p>And for tracking, you <i>really</i> don't want flat response; you want cans that'll reinforce the musician's ability to hear themselves, the headphone equivalent of a presence peak.  Isolation is critical - no headphone bleeding. But the most important quality for tracking headphones is ruggedness; they are going to get abused, and they need to be easily repairable but rarely need repairing.<p>All of which is to say: being universal doesn't imply being the best-sounding or the most-comfortable; it implies being optimal for the needs of a recording studio.",1330131879

In fact it was my understanding that almost everyone knows this (in regards to tips not landing on IRS forms) and lets it slide as really its the only way those that do this as a 'real job[0]' get by.  This is why it is, at least for those I've known, considered 'bad form' to tip on credit card as those tips flow through company pipes to the employee's taxable income.<p>[0] real job meaning career employment vs a job while getting through college or whatever.",1330131876

3270664,comment,3267432,3270264,1,0,StatHacking,,,"> In the real world where not everyone is a programmer people don't feel restricted by proprietary software. Only in some hypothetical ivory tower manned by RMS are non-developers restricted by proprietary things.<p>This is irrespective and has nothing to do with the point. I can figure out tons of adjectives to """"""describe"""""" you. Also, I don't know why people think their reality is ""<i>the</i> real world"" and extrapolates it to others' ""real worlds"".<p>It is not about being a dev or not, it's about a system which someone relies on (even a society with Google) and ensuring its continuity and the best for all. If you ensure it, people will recognize your work and the money will come.<p>> While writing that list of open source software I use, I realized that only Emacs and GCC are GPL. Why is it that the most popular open source software is not GPL licensed? If the GPL encourages and fosters collaboration why is the MIT, BSD, and MPL licensed software more active and popular? It almost seems as if removing the restrictions from the GPL encourages collaboration. The Linux kernel is a notable exception, so I'm not saying this is 100% true, but the evidence seems to support it in many cases.<p>A software is ""good"" independent of its license. Licenses don't fix bugs. If you measure by adoption, then you should conclude that Visual Studio is what has encouraged most of the software developing in the past - and I think it's true, but hasn't to do with licensing and business models.<p>Your evidence supports that many licenses are being used, and that's a good thing. If you want to do things because many people does them, then you should adopt the Chinese culture. We have a phrase here: ""Eat Shit: Trillions of flies can't be wrong."" (this is not about Chinesse culture, they have outstanding good things and others not so good).<p>It took about 10 years to the industry to understand that they could earn money with open source software. It was very hard to try to explain someone that he could do better with a different model. Now that the industry has ""internalize"" it, everybody loves open source. AGPL is the next step: there is room for improvement and you will <i>probably</i> (<i>IMO</i>) do better with a more sustainable model.",1322067460

3270510,comment,3270165,3270337,13,0,gyardley,,,"Haven't checked the numbers, but if it's true, shorting began in earnest <i>because</i> the cost to borrow went from 95% to (a still pretty obscene) 30%. At 95%, to make money on a year-long short the stock would have to drop to pennies. At 30%, it still needs to be a massive dog, but it's doable.<p>The sudden explosion in shorting caused by this drop in cost to borrow is probably seen as a negative signal and making some investors nervous, causing the stock to drop as they sell it off.<p>But the cost to borrow doesn't normally drop from 95% to 30% in the absence of a lot of newly-issued shares. So why did this happen? Someone must have made a large number of shares available to borrow - so the question here is <i>who was it</i> and <i>why did they do it</i>?<p>With the Groupon float so teeny, it's a lot easier to manipulate pricing. This could be completely straightforward and boring, but this could be an institution with advance notice of some <i>favorable</i> information about Groupon setting naive investors up for a classic short squeeze. (Good news comes out, some shorters panic and buy to cover their shorts, increased demand causes prices to rise, more shorters panic... iterate your way to a massive pop and a whole lot of severely-burned shorters.) This would be a good way to compensate for the inevitable drop when the lock-up period expires.<p>TL;DR - Don't buy or short individual stocks without fully understanding what's going on, and that goes beyond the fundamentals of the business.",1322065397

Among many favored ways to circumvent it are underreporting, effecting the transaction in a jurisdiction which has a favorable sales tax (New York every so often <i>prosecutes</i> people for the crime of buying art in Connecticut), classifying the sale as something which has favorable tax treatment, etc etc.  I've heard hilarious accounts of merchandising decisions by which a handbag was only sold in combination with a scarf such that the transaction became clothing + accessory (taxed at LOW%) rather than luxury goods (taxed at HIGH%), despite neither the buyer nor seller benefiting from the bundling of the scarf.",1322064679
3270455,comment,3270105,3270410,5,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Many people oppose ideas like this because it is less progressive (w.r.t. income) than an income tax, and they hold an apriori belief that taxation should be proportional to income. This is because consumption rises sublinearly with income, and people at the bottom actually tend to consume more than they earn. In mathematical terms, dConsumption/dIncome < 1.<p>In practical terms, this means that most of Steve Job's wealth is not stuff he can consume, but rather productive capacity that he directs.<p>In fact, many people at the bottom of the income scales actually consume considerably more than they earn, so a sales tax would be a big tax hike for them.<p>Raw data: ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/ce/standard/2009/income.txt<p>This blog post has a graph of consumption vs income: <a href=""http://crazybear.posterous.com/why-the-poor-dont-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crazybear.posterous.com/why-the-poor-dont-work</a>",1322064662

In this case you paid 1.2MM in tax for a marginal tax rate of 4%.<p>On the other hand if your income is 15k you're probably spending it all or very close. In which case your marginal tax rate is 15%.<p>Not all that fair I'd say.<p>Personally I like the progressive income tax method. I just think capital gains should be taxed as income rather than at a flat 13% and no special rules for corporations either. If they want to be people they can be taxed like people. If they want to be different then we can just get rid of corporate personhood. I doubt they'd like that much.",1322064479

Another problem is that I live in Europe in a city with no startup/IT culture. Around me I only see .NET developers and SAP consultants and no such things as Code Academy or HN meet ups. Also, I have limited time as I work full time in controlling/finance.<p>An example of position that would interest me: http://www.readyforzero.com/jobs/backend-engineer.<p>So, lately, I have been thinking that I could work for free on week ends and, if the potential employees mentors me, that I could learn enough in 2 or 3 months to be hired as a junior. I think I can learn so fast because I already know the basic concepts, I programmed in python and R to analyse pricing in a medium company and now I am building a small analytical tool in clojure.<p>I see this as a win win situation. The potential employer gets some free work and the chance to know deeply who he is hiring (if he decides to hire, of course), I get the chance to accelerate my programming learning and possibly relocate to a part of the world where people actually have a start up culture.<p>What do you think? Comments, advices? If you think this is a good idea, how would you go with implementation? Web site and post on HN? Other ways?<p>Thanks!",1322064356

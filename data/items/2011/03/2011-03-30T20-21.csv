I want to add another possibility, because with a broad enough range of options you might find something quite effective.<p>It occurs to me you may be under challenged. It seems your academic life comes easy enough for you to simply go through the motions, allowing for listlessness to set in. To remedy that I'd find some challenge to take you out of your comfort zone like a marathon, for example, or trying to master something such as a game/sport or new skill. Done correctly, you won't really have time to stare at a screen for 30 minutes. Find something constructive that interests you. If it's something that scares you (because you may fail) even better. It may just be that you're in a rut and need to be shaken out of it. One thing is for sure: you can't regularly challenge yourself to scary things outside your comfort zone, succeed in such enterprises and remain depressed all the while. At least I sincerely doubt it.<p>Good luck!",1301518650

 Another great aspect of node.js is the ease at which you can develop soft real time systems. By that I mean stuff like twitter, chat software, sport bets or interfaces to instant messaging networks.
'''<p>Those are not all 'soft real time' applications, especially not twitter. Soft real time here might mean that the usefulness of a result degrades if it misses its deadline. This might be the case of some chat software, but in the case of twitter, I receive very little degradation of service if I just go tomorrow.<p>The key point here is that you have to be able to have a metric of a deadline and what to do when you fail it. ""If we do not get an acknowledgement by 30 ms, we assume the current node is too busy for our needs and retry on a different one"" could be an example of this.<p>'''
 So don't try to build hard realtime systems in node, that require consistent response times. Erlang is probably a better choice for these kinds of applications.
'''<p>Erlang is made specifically for soft real time applications, not hard real time. You do <i>not</i> want to use Erlang to build things like life or death systems when you need to be precise to the microsecond. It is pretty good when you can miss a deadline, handle that, work your way around it, but it can not offer any guarantee about never missing a deadline. Not only does this section give bad advice about node.js, it also gives bad advice on other languages.<p>It just feels as if the author meant to say ""It is good for interfaces with live updates, which could be slow or lack constancy of response times"", not much more.<p>Later in the same section:<p>'''
 Combining this with node's radical model of non-blocking I/O, you have to try very hard to create a sluggish application.
'''<p>My understanding was that you actually have to be careful not to write code that runs for too long, in order to avoid messing up your request times by ruining the cooperative scheduling scheme used in the language.<p>===<p>In general, the previous guides seem to be nicer, although I have to question the reason behind advice like 'do not extend the prototypes'. I figure it has to do with the difficulty of keeping things compatible, but if you're giving me advice, tell me <i>why</i>. Do not expect me to blindly follow your standards just because you said so.<p>In the deployment part, it is shown how to use screen to start and detach the server. Is there any reason why nohup or disown won't do it? it is advised not to use the shown setup for a production system -- it would be nice to know where to look for that.<p>I'd also generally be interested in knowing how you'd avoid spaghetti callback hell from the approach used in node.js, but that doesn't seem to be part of the guide.

I have been preparing for this moment for a few months now, starting back in December of 2010. I implemented a dialog popup in my other games that asked the user if they'd like me to e-mail them when I released a new game. Since that time, amazingly, I have been able to collect over 30,000 e-mails. I created an e-mail campaign at Campaign Monitor, and loaded in my list. I created an extremely basic e-mail, and got everything ready to pull the trigger. Here's the e-mail:<p><pre><code>   Hello!

   This is Andrew Garrison, the creator of BridgeBasher. 
   I am excited to let you know that BridgeBasher's sequel,
   SimplePhysics, is now available in the App Store! If 
   you like BridgeBasher, then you will love SimplePhysics.
   You can find out more about it here:
   http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplephysics/id408233979?mt=8
  
   Thanks, and I hope you enjoy it!
   -Andrew
   
   ps - If you do not wish to receive e-mails about my game
   releases in the future, you can unsubscribe here.
</code></pre>
At the same time, as I was setting up this e-mail campaign, I tweaked my other apps, and I removed the e-mail signup dialog and replaced it with a dialog that linked directly to my new app. I submitted the update to Apple, and set it to ""Hold for Developer Release."" Now I had all of my ducks in a row. When I release these updates, and my existing user base loads up the new version, they will immediately be hit with a dialog telling them about my new game, along with a link directly to the iTunes page where they can buy it.<p>SimplePhysics went live last Thursday and I sat on it for a few days to make sure it propagated to all app stores worldwide. Last night, I pulled the trigger. I sent the e-mail and I logged into iTunesConnect and released all of my app updates. After less than 12 hours, SimplePhysics has risen to #12 overall in the iTunes App Store. I have complete refresh-syndrome. I am constantly holding my iPhone, checking the charts every other minute. I watched in complete amazement as SimplePhysics rose to #1 in Games->Simulation, ousting NBA Elite, a game made by fucking Electrnoic Arts. It is almost euphoric to see a game that I made sitting on top of a game made by EA.<p>I do realize that this rise on the charts is fleeting. I realize that once all of my e-mails are opened, and once all of my users have updated, that the game will start quickly falling from the charts. Nonetheless, it is still extremely exciting, and I hope it will encourage my fellow indie game devs. The app store is such a great opportunity for indie game development. It is the only place that I know of where a little guy like me can outsell a major game company.<p>If you want to see the app, here's the product page for it:
http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simplephysics/id408233979?mt=8<p>ps - I'm not asking you to buy my app, but you know, I can't say I'd be offended if you did......I mean, I did just give you all of my secrets ;)",1301516742

But based on what Paul Allen is mentioning here and based on few other stories of startups which made it big like Facebook, few thoughts came to my mind:<p>1) Is it that to make it really big, to the likes of Microsoft, Facebook a founder has to play games and trick his own friends in a way that the founder owns majority of stake in the company. I am not necessarily saying it is bad, it is just a observation and want your opinion. It is totally possible that one of the co-founders is so passionate about the idea that he works hard by twice or thrice as much as other cofounder and in the process somehow manages to get hold of major equity. What do you think? Is it necessary to be evil to make it big? Does your passion blind you somewhere in the process where one cannot distinguish right from ""not so much right""?<p>2) I dont see and havent heard about Steve Jobs being great friends with Steve Wozniak. So is Bill gates with Paul Allen. Facebook Mark Z and other cofounders have some fights between them too. Given this and stories from similar or smaller companies, it makes me think, is it possible to have a good and healthy friend ship like relationship with your co-founder after a period of time? Or with the turn of events in the company it is bound to happen that the relationship will go sour?

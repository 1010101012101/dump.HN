904355,comment,902999,902999,0,0,Edog,,,"There seems to be a consensus that SEO is distorting Google search. I think I can refine that a bit. It appears that Google is using a ""don't feed the trolls"" strategy in response to link spam. Here's my evidence:<p>""The Modbookish"" is an inconsequential six member Ning social network, but doing a Google search on ""Modbookish"" is interesting. There are the annoying 'Google thinks you are stupid' hits like the site in which there is a sentence ending with ""mod"" followed by a sentence beginning with ""Bookish"". The remaining results are sites that link to the Modbookish. However, the Modbookish itself is NOT in the results. As Google ads are on the site, there is no doubt that the Google bot visited it shortly after it went online. Nonetheless, Google has refused to put the site into its web index for a couple months now. Clearly, (and not without cause), it is assuming that the pages that link to the site are link spam. It is probably waiting for some semi-authoritative link to appear before it indexes it.<p>So, why is this bad? It undermines Google search purpose: to provide the most relevant results. When Google got started, I recall that when Sergey or Larry were asked why Google search was better they often offered the Harvard example. If one enters the search term ""Harvard"" with no other terms into a web search box, there is really only one reasonable search result: the Harvard University website. However, in the search engines of the time, the university often ended up on page five or six. On Google, it was search result number one. By the same token, if you enter ""Modbookish"" (no spaces) there is only one reasonable result, and Google doesn't offer it. In contrast, both Duck-Duck-Go and Yahoo list it in the first spot.<p>Why is this really bad? Many (Most?) websites do not do their own site indexing; they let Google do it for them. Clearly if Google refuses to index a certain important but only occasionally referenced page, that is a problem.",1256598321

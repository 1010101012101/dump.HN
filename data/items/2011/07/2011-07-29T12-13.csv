And they completely reskinned the Droid 2's UI, and it looks <i>ugly</i>.<p>If the carriers would ship their phones with stock, performance-optimized Android software, people wouldn't have so many complaints about Android.

There's nothing particularly novel about insuring homes, their contents or vacation rentals.

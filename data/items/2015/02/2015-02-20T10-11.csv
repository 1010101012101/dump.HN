Forgetting this explicit update can result in silent regressions of the submodule’s referenced commit. -- This is something handled automatically in Mercurial. Is there any reason why the same behaviour is not used in Git?<p>* Commands such as status and diff display precious little info about submodules by default. -- This should be possible to implement, no? It&#x27;s also something that&#x27;s available in Mercurial (using the --subrepos flag), and it&#x27;s a huge boost to usability.",1424429819

9079879,comment,9078660,9078797,0,0,andresp,,,"This was the clearest explanation in my opinion. I&#x27;m still a bit confused regarding how much information have we actually got and what mechanism is behind &quot;passing a test&quot; to influence the amount of information when the test result is not definitive (as in this case). We were just given a complete information about one of the options the user didn&#x27;t choose, but not any direct new information specific of the door the user didn&#x27;t choose and that remains closed.<p>Imagine that after opening the door everyone goes home and a new participant who has no knowledge of the previous experiment is called to make a decision between the two remaining doors. Obviously in this case the probably is 1:2, as there is no information regarding the previous test. Actually, if we imagine a similar situation happened before the initial problem with a previous show with 4 doors, we may as well see that the initial probability of 1:3 is also wrong if we had access to the knowledge about the previous experiment.<p>I still agree with the switch suggestion, but the mechanism behind it is still not entirely clear.<p>A more intuitive example would also be to invert the problem: leave one of the non picked doors (C) out of the random opening and use the door the contestant picked (A) as a possible case in the random opening experiment. If we start by opening A, then we already know enough to see if the user won or lost, if we open B and there is the car behind it, we already know everything. If we open B and there is a goat behind the door, consider whether you would switch your choice from A to C. I guess you probably wouldn&#x27;t and it would feel easier to justify your position, as this doesn&#x27;t involve the &quot;psychological pain&quot; of changing a previous choice by reasons that you don&#x27;t entirely understand (associated with possible loss-aversion feelings).",1424429140

And I&#x27;m typing on my phone, so I might not explain fully.<p>Suppose I were wanting to overinflated the value of my business to show to investors or for another reason - I could create an account that had within it a large additional amount of fiat (by entering that value in the DB).<p>Then, I have an idea... Using that fake deposit, I can start buying BTC. And, as long as the price of BTC is going up, I&#x27;m actually printing money and making real fiat out of the initial fake deposit.<p>This works as long as the price continues to increase and people continue to trade - if either of those factors trends down, the fake fiat will be noticed.<p>Unwinding this becomes tricky - if you sell too fast, you cause the price decrease. And if anybody gets wind of it, they&#x27;ll abandon ship.<p>In some ways, this has an analogue in what happened at Lehman and AIG. The CDO market worked as long as the default assumptions were right and the value of the underlying assets continued to appreciate - as soon as they didn&#x27;t, the margin requirements wiped out all of their reserve capital.<p>It also reminds me a bit of QE - the &quot;printed&quot; fiat was inserted in to the market and used to purchase assets in a way that supported the market. When he easing stops, if the value of the assets can&#x27;t be supported by continuing market pressure, the market for those assets crashes.",1424428824

For example, in Belgium the rule is that the basis for VAT does not include the &#x27;prompt payment discount&#x27;. E.g.: invoice is 100, 2% 10 net 30. How much is the VAT @ 21%? It&#x27;s 0.21 * 98, so your invoice can say &#x27;total payable before xx/xx/xxxx: 98 + 0.21 * 98, after that: 100 + 0.21 * 98.<p>I had a long, drawn-out argument with a supplier once whose very accounting manager didn&#x27;t understand this concept. They would have me pay VAT on the 100, because otherwise, according to them, they&#x27;d be giving me &#x27;a discount on the VAT&#x27; (that sentence doesn&#x27;t make any sense whatsoever). So I called the tax office, PLUS an accountant, to confirm the right way for them to bill me, and they still didn&#x27;t believe me (or rather - didn&#x27;t understand me).

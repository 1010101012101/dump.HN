5096357,comment,5095643,5095643,6,0,jdietrich,,,"Exactly the same thing is happening in the movie industry.<p>The critic Mark Kermode has written at length about the phenomenon of the ""motion picture event"" - a movie so expensive that it is newsworthy regardless of creative merit. People will go and watch lousy-but-expensive films, just to see what all the fuss is about. The canonical example is the 2001 film ""Pearl Harbour"", which was an absolute stinker but made a profit of $60m on a $140m budget.<p>We're currently in the era of the mega-blockbuster - vastly expensive superhero and fantasy films that are a relatively safe bet financially, because they very effectively capture the casual market that might only see one or two movies a year. Even adjusting for inflation, nearly all of the most expensive films of all time were shot in the last decade.<p>At the other end of the spectrum, it's possible to make a genre movie for a niche audience on a tiny budget, knowing that even without a theatrical release you can promote it virally and turn a good profit on DVD sales.<p>You can spend $150m on Call of Warfighter XVII, knowing that it'll sell a gazillion copies in every superstore in the developed world. You can also spend a tiny fraction of that on Garbage Truck Simulator, in the knowledge that 100% of your potential customers will be able to find it on Steam with no real promotional spend necessary.",1358848192

A colleague and I made a responsible exposure to a vendor that provides the application software for the California State University system. The vulnerability I chanced upon, and that my colleague was able to verify to be fully open, made it possible to obtain the private details of hundreds of thousands of applicants from their system. How were we rewarded for quietly and responsibly disclosing this to the vendor? The vendor threatened a lawsuit against the university, and the university cowtailed and nearly fired my colleague, severely reprimanding him and myself. Little did I know this would become a theme of my stint in working for academia, of the universities not caring at all about students and their private data.

5096339,comment,5095643,5095643,2,0,brianchu,,,"I think consoles are a dying segment. Casual won't eat console, though. <i>Mobile</i> will eat console, because of 1) greater audience and 2) a shift of console-quality games from mobile to console.<p>We're talking about a platform that more than 50% of all US teens own (and growing), a platform that is carried around nearly everywhere by most users, a platform that is expanding globally.<p>Because of that audience, we're looking at ROIs that can outpace console games. Halo 4's dev and marketing costs are estimated to be well over $100MM. Its first weekend gross was $220MM. Halo 3's first weekend sales were roughly $170MM and Halo 3 ended up selling roughly $600MM total (10 million copies sold [1]). So based on that let's be generous and extrapolate Halo 4's total sales as $800MM. Keep in mind that I'm not even taking into account 1) eventual discounting on each unit and 2) retail markups and packaging costs. Angry Birds (first version) cost $135k to develop. It grossed 7.35MM (after Apple's ""retail"" cut) [3]. Angry Birds has a ROI of 54x. Halo 4 has a ROI of 8x (and I'm being liberal).<p>It's also a mistake to think that smartphones are purely for casual games. Console-quality games are already moving to the iOS/Android platforms. So-called mid-core games are very profitable on mobile. There is a trend of games charging greater and greater amounts of money, as the Final Fantasy ports do. The market most certainly <i>does not</i> enforce a $0.99 price point. Games with higher production values routinely push past that price point.<p>Bear in mind that the iPhone 5 is considerably more powerful than the Xbox, and is roughly 1/4th as powerful as the Xbox 360 on one metric (texture rendering). Given 1) exponential growth in mobile processing/graphics power, 2) the increasing delay between console launches which allows for catching up (8 years between the Xbox 360 and Xbox next-gen, assuming a 2013 release date), and 3) diminishing marginal returns in graphical quality when hardware quality is increased past a certain point, in 2-3 years smartphones will be capable of Xbox 360 games, and a few years after that will have caught up with next-gen consoles. This gap is narrowing even faster with tablets. The article mentions how the Wii U is comparable to an iPad 4. There are tons of startups out there building game controllers to overcome/augment the limitations of touch UIs. Mobile games are already being wirelessly hooked up to televisions/monitors.<p>Big budget console games won't die. Not completely. There will always be a market for the absolute bleeding edge. But I think it's clear that mobile gaming will eat up huge segments of the console market. One ""type"" of console that I see as a <i>potential</i> commercial hit would be immersive AR platforms, like the Oculus Rift. But there's no reason that mobile can't eat that too after several years.<p>Looking even farther into the future, I think there is great potential for other advancements in mobile such as actual physical buttons that are programmatically generated over the touchscreen [4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.vgchartz.com/article/4787/halo-3-sells-10-million-copies-worldwide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vgchartz.com/article/4787/halo-3-sells-10-million...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.mobilewebgo.com/how-did-angry-birds-become-blockbuster-rovio-video-interview-and-transcript"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobilewebgo.com/how-did-angry-birds-become-blockb...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.symbian-freak.com/news/010/12/angry_birds_hits_42_million_free_and_paid_downloads.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symbian-freak.com/news/010/12/angry_birds_hits_42...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/13/this-is-the-future/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/13/this-is-the-future/</a>",1358847783

5096334,comment,5091684,5094243,2,0,powatom,,,"I think it largely depends on the type of website you're running. For example, the kinds of websites I visit are relatively text heavy - I want to see the text regardless of which device I'm using. These websites are pretty light on images and few use any kind of 'novel' widgets or fancy animations. For these kinds of websites, I think responsive design is a pretty nice solution to the problem of different screen sizes. By and large, implementing a responsive design using the methods outlined in the OP is a nice solution which has the best trade-off between results and development time.<p>However, if you're running a photo-blog, then you probably want to only serve smaller images to mobile clients, and larger ones to desktop clients. Same goes for interactive websites. If your website has some novel navigation mechanism, or is very JS heavy, then you probably want to think more about whether you simply need to split your website into two separate versions: one for mobile, one for desktop.<p>I think a decent 'cut-off' point is when you start needing to muck about with handling viewport sizes through JS. At this point, it seems to me like your design isn't capable of handling the various screen sizes: if my mobile browser needs to run a bunch of javascript just to display correctly - by turning a menu bar into a drop-down menu for example, or modifying the page's navigation mechanisms - then in all honestly you might save yourself time and effort by simply creating a separate mobile version.<p>Obviously, there are exceptions to any rule, and I don't think there are any true clear boundaries, and even the 'JS boundary' can be managed nicely through progressive enhancement and dependency management.<p>Personally, I'm pretty happy with the 'one size fits all' solution. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with media queries and simply modifying the CSS based on viewport size. It seems much more work to create and maintain separate versions of a website's theme for different viewport sizes.",1358847707

How does this failure rate compare with historical norms? How big are these companies really? Other lists of large budgets, large layoffs, large numbers of units required to break even make similar non-points.<p>The larger point is that game art is expensive.

5096250,comment,5095643,5096204,2,0,NoPiece,,,"I liked Far Cry 3, but it is the perfect example of what I was talking about. Far Cry 2 took a lot of risks (and failed in some ways). Far Cry 3 is polished as hell, but basically dumbed down so that anyone can pick it up and play. Objects you should pick up glow and even beep when you look at them. There is a mini map with arrows telling you where to go. There are pop ups constantly telling you what to do. And it is the third game in a franchise. I liked it, but found it very safe.<p>The Witcher 2 was developed in Poland for ~8million. Great quality from a relatively small company and team. Compare that to Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (I know it is old, but wanted to find citable numbers). $50 million dollar dev budget, and $200 million dollar launch budget according to the LA Times (<a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/18/business/fi-ct-duty18"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/18/business/fi-ct-duty1...</a>).

I made the decision years ago to work in the industry as a programmer, because it's more fun and pays better than being an academic, especially where I live. I'm not officially involved with my old University, but I still take part in their mailing lists, think about Physics in my free time, I even submit simple papers to journals [+].

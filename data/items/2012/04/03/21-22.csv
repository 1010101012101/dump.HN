That's the sort of thing you're likely to do for most of your traffic with any database once you scale up.<p>PostgreSQL also didn't have some of the features that made MySQL really fast until relatively recently, e.g. being able to entirely resolve a query on indexes without ever looking up the actual data rows.<p>I'd say the biggest problem MySQL has at scale is that replicated changes are applied in a single thread whereas updates on master servers are multi-threaded.<p>I'm very excited by recent improvements in PostgreSQL, and I wish it were the database I worked with professionally, but don't be so quick to dismiss MySQL.",1333489286

Had I purchased a PC from some specific company, such as Dell, stating that I have a ""Dell computer"" would indeed be accurate (stating ""I have a Dell"" is not technically correct; Dell is a company, not a computer). In a similar since, saying I use ""Gentoo"", ""Trisquel"", ""Ubuntu"", ""Arch"", etc is accurate.<p>I built my PC using hardware I purchased separately. I do see your argument - if someone asks me ""what type of computer do you own"", I would not list each hardware component individually. The problem is - that question is terribly vague. What type of computer do I own? Well, it's classified as a PC. Generally, when someone asks that question, they are looking for a specific company name. When I respond that I built my own, that answers their question.<p>If someone asks ""what type of processor"", I would then respond ""I use an AMD-based system"". In that sense, if someone asked what kernel I use, I would respond ""I use a Linux-based system"" --- they were specific enough to inquire about a specific component, so I would respond in such a way that answers their question.<p>""What operating system do you use?"" Technically, I use GNU, and to those who understand what GNU is, I respond just like that --- ""GNU"". For those who may be unfamiliar with GNU, I will state ""GNU with Linux"" --- the GNU operating system with the Linux kernel. If I used GNU with another kernel, it is still GNU. Linux is one component of my operating system.<p>That said my display server, window manager, text editor, etc are also all useful components of my operating system. I would not say I use ""GNU/X/Xmonad/Vim"", simply because that is not a distinction commonly requested. Perhaps one day, if Wayland becomes popular, ""GNU/Linux/X"" would be useful/necessary.",1333489156

That's very much a subjective process in many cases, and there are often multiple valid ways to code the same observation.<p>All of that data entry would take time that physicians don't have. It would only be potentially worth doing for complex cases. Unless you can find a way to pay providers for doing the extra coding and data entry. Insurance generally won't pay extra for data entry beyond what they need for billing, and billing data isn't sufficiently detailed for diagnosis.<p>ML also doesn't account for human intuition and tacit knowledge.

Not everyone receives 1 beer every day. Sometimes, the men only collectively use 8 beer, other 12 (especially when the men figure that they should buy some beer for the bar across the street).

It sounds like a fun place from the culture side, but also from the technology side--specifically, I'm amazed by what a small team can do in a 48-hour hackathon with today's technology. The one that comes to mind is that ""Infinite Scrabble MMO"" from about 18 months ago. 150 man-hours can produce <i>that</i>? Wow.<p>I did research in undergrad (mostly over the summers, but a bit during the year). I had a lot of fun, and it was motivating work. But it was programming work! I wrote a bunch of data analysis code and did a little bit of GEANT simulation stuff, and it all felt more like programming than physics. And the ""physics research"" (experimentalists) that I have seen looks more like engineering (designing/building some apparatus, then fixing all of the problems...).<p>It just seems so slow-moving compared to the software industry. There's a lot less room for individualism, and it feels like you've got a lot of really smart people doing a lot of menial, commodity tasks (I'm thinking of every PhD candidate and postdoc I've ever known).<p>I'll have to give theory a closer look. It's hard to see myself in it any time soon, because there's more material I'd need to learn first.<p>(I think I'm rambling to myself now.)

There are far less questions about the purpose and meaning of code when its in Ada.  Seriously!  And to boot the documentation writers have fewer problems determine this either since it's all spelled out in plain language.  Of course this applies some to Pascal, Oberon and Modula for example, but they are missing other things that make Ada a great choice.",1333486890

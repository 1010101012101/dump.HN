Like everything else with 3D printing, the first things will be small and I doubt NASA will forego incorporating redundancy in favor of sending more printers.<p>But I imagine the space (and cost) saving potential is huge here. I&#x27;m guessing the space station requires a number of redundant and common parts. That has a cost, a common part is more easily replaced, but has to be made to the lowest common denominator. Niche parts have to be carried in duplicate or triplicate, I&#x27;m sure. If someone could chime in, I&#x27;d like to know how much that&#x27;s the case.<p>If my supposition is true, then this means fewer parts need share common components, and this means less weight and more room for everything else. Now if only they could 3D print better meals and more dignified sanitation for the brave members of the ISS, I&#x27;m sure they would appreciate that.",1416988755

It&#x27;s usually some bonding experience. We stayed up all night and did X. We drank together and had a heart to heart. We both love doing Y and spent a lot of time doing that. We travelled together. We suffered through college classes. We spent weekends hanging out together. We spent years talking on IRC. Often there&#x27;s also some something about level of trust. Someone reveals something about themselves. They talk about something personal that they normally wouldn&#x27;t. Etc. Absent either of those, my acquaintances tend to stay acquaintances.<p>On the flipside, I&#x27;ve found that keeping around people who don&#x27;t value you, don&#x27;t have your best interests at heart or intentionally cause you to feel bad in any way is just a bad idea. Wanting to become better friends doesn&#x27;t make it so. It&#x27;s a two sided thing.

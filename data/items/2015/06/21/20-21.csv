9754949,comment,9751230,9754905,0,0,ColinWright,,,"I really don&#x27;t have time for a complete point-by-point here, I really don&#x27;t.  The proof as you&#x27;ve stated it here is really, really close to being complete and correct.  Mostly the problems are where you haven&#x27;t said something that is, in fact, true, reasonable, and easy to add.  The point being that you haven&#x27;t actually said it.<p>Step 1 is the specific example.  You say:<p><pre><code>    1. Assume there is no prime number larger than p_n.\n</code></pre>\nBut you haven&#x27;t said that p_1 through p_n are all the primes up to and including p_n.  A set that satisfies your step 1 is the set { 7 }.  I can read your step 1 and say: OK, I&#x27;ll assume that { 7 } is the set of all primes.<p>Then you say:<p><pre><code>    2. Compute the product of all the prime\n       numbers less than or equal to p_n,\n       plus one. Call this number c.\n</code></pre>\nThe natural reading of this is to think you&#x27;re saying that p_1, p_2, p_3, ..., p_n are the primes up to p_n.  If not, why have you called it p_n and not simply called it P.  Doing so makes it clear that in step 2 you are taking all the primes up to some limit, rather than taking all the primes in a collection of size n, with p_n the maximum element.<p>This is exacerbated by the fact that the usual proof does start with a specific collection, which is at odds with what you seem to be saying.<p>You say:<p><pre><code>    > Since I don&#x27;t know which numbers\n    > I multiplied together, I won&#x27;t\n    > know the numeric value of the\n    > number produced in step 3, but\n    > I certainly do know that by\n    > construction, it is not divisible\n    > by any prime <= p_n.\n</code></pre>\nYes, but only if you use this unexpected interpretation that p_n is simply a limit, and not the largest/last element of an arbitrary set of primes.<p>So the proof you&#x27;ve given is not exactly the usual proof, it&#x27;s subtly different.  The notation you use brings to mind the usual proof, and creates a confusion about what you&#x27;re actually saying.  The objective of the proof I gave is to avoid those potential mis-interpretations.<p>Does that make it clear?  Perhaps it&#x27;s important to add that I&#x27;m not saying your proof is actually wrong, I&#x27;m just saying that if an undergrad produced it I&#x27;d be asking for clarification on a few points to see if they really understood it, or if they&#x27;d just memorised it and perhaps missed a point, or muddled two formulations.",1434920017

Some of those reasons would be flattering to people in that age range (more likely to be trendsetters, for example) and some would not be (more susceptible to marketing, or more likely to want to follow trends established by perceived trendsetters). But it seems like it&#x27;s been this way my whole life.<p>Is the marketing focus on the Millenial Generation simply the fact that the age demographics that marketers have always been fixated on now roughly corresponds with the age range associated with Millenials?

9754940,comment,9753730,9754104,0,0,cwzwarich,,,"The basic linear scan algorithm generates poor code, so you almost always want to extend it with additional heuristics. If any of these heuristics involve reversing a tentative decision then you have to rewind the state of the entire register allocator, because the linear scan algorithm is designed to process the function in one direction. This coarse-grained backtracking is fairly expensive. If you use a better algorithm that lets you consider tentative decisions on a more individual basis, then you scale better than linear scan with these extensions.<p>Because of the poor output code quality of the linear scan allocator (even with all of the additional heuristics), there was a post-pass that performed local optimizations. Over time it accumulated a lot of special cases to target particular poor code patterns, and it became more expensive than just using a register allocator that produced better code in the first place.",1434919855

If you want to hack web or phone apps for a startup, a degree may not be necessary. But if you want to work on software that requires significant algorithmic or math knowledge (e.g., building something like Photoshop or Google search), the formal knowledge that you&#x27;d get from completing a CS degree would probably be helpful. (Remember that the guys who founded Google weren&#x27;t college dropouts - they were PhD students at Stanford.)<p>The original poster may decide after a few years that they&#x27;re tired of working for startups (or startup funding may dry up), and having a CS degree would give them many more options on what kind of jobs they could get. Big companies like Google or Facebook have a tendency to hire people with degrees. A degree from a well-known university serves as a signal (whether justified or not) for quickly sorting through the huge stacks of resumes that these companies receive.<p>So I&#x27;d agree with the advice that others have already offered: finish the degree to keep your options open; there will be other (perhaps better) startup opportunities in a couple of years.",1434919772

9754936,comment,9751230,9754915,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Factoring is not a huge burden compared to the earlier steps<p>I agree with this. My point is just that it&#x27;s not required for the proof, and usually isn&#x27;t included -- so the proof is not constructive. You can extend it to be constructive in a very straightforward manner, but you don&#x27;t have to and you usually don&#x27;t.<p>The reason I&#x27;m calling this a nonconstructive proof is by analogy to the following proof, often given as an example of a nonconstructive proof:<p>Theorem: it is possible for an irrational number raised to an irrational power to result in a rational number.<p>0. For typographic convenience, let r = sqrt(2). r is known to be irrational.<p>1. r^r might or might not be rational -- who knows?<p>2a. If r^r is rational, the theorem is proved.<p>2b. If r^r is not rational, then (r^r)^r is an irrational number raised to an irrational power, but (r^r)^r = r^(r⋅r) = r^2 = 2, which is rational.<p>3. Therefore, there exists some pair a,b for which the following is true: (I) a and b are both irrational; (II) a^b is rational.<p>I don&#x27;t see any way to consider this proof nonconstructive while considering the proof of the inifinitude of the primes that I&#x27;ve described as constructive.

9754905,comment,9751230,9754839,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> In step 1 you haven&#x27;t assumed that you know all the primes up to p_n, and then in step 2, you assume that you do have them. If you don&#x27;t make step 1 more precise, saying that you know all the primes up to p_n, then when you multiply them all together and add 1, step 3 fails.<p>Why? We know that the largest prime is p_n, and the numbers from 1 to p_n are finite. Each of them might or might not be prime. It&#x27;s perfectly legitimate to say &quot;multiply together all the primes between 1 and p_n&quot; without knowing which numbers in particular those happen to be. Since I don&#x27;t know which numbers I multiplied together, I won&#x27;t know the numeric value of the number produced in step 3, but I certainly <i>do</i> know that by construction, it is not divisible by any prime <= p_n. (Technically, I know this conditional on the lemma &quot;all prime numbers are greater than one.)<p>The proof I&#x27;ve given doesn&#x27;t deal with arbitrary sets of primes at all. There is no point in the proof at which you could multiply 3 and 5 and then add one to produce 16. If 5 is the largest prime, the number (implicitly) computed in step 3 is 2⋅3⋅5 + 1 = 31. Iterating from 2 (but why?), you&#x27;d compute 3, then 7, then 211, and then something large. And 2⋅3⋅5⋅7⋅11⋅13 + 1 = 30031 = 59⋅509 isn&#x27;t a counterexample to the proof I&#x27;ve given, because the conclusion is explicitly &quot;the number constructed must have a prime factor greater than p_n&quot;, and p_n in this example is 13. 59 and 509 are both greater than 13.<p>Where does my proof fail? How is yours more correct? You still seem to think that I&#x27;m misstating the proof found in the <i>Elements</i>. You can prove things more than one way.",1434918978

If you don&#x27;t make step 1 more precise, saying that you know <i>all</i> the primes up to p_n, then when you multiply them all together and add 1, step 3 fails.<p>The point is that the proof is fairly robust, and yet stating it all completely correctly is actually quite hard.  Here is a more correct version:<p>We know there are at least some primes.  For example, 3 is prime. Take any non-empty finite collection of primes.  Multiply them all together, and add 1.  The result may not be prime, but it is expressible as the product of primes, and hence there is at least one prime that divides it.  That prime cannot be one of the primes in our finite collection, and hence any finite collection of primes does not contain them all.<p>The classic counter-examples used when there are proof with holes are these:<p>Consider the set of primes { 3, 5 }.  Multiply them together and add 1, and all the primes that divide the result are less than the primes you have.<p>Starting with 2 and then repeatedly getting a new prime by multipying and adding 1 we get 3, then 7, then 43, but 2.3.7.43+1 = 13.139.<p>Finally, taking known successive primes we get &quot;failure&quot; at: 2.3.5.7.11.13+1 = 59.509<p>And as an addendum, I&#x27;ve heard this before, but a few days ago Carl Pomerance told me of a joke he heard from Henrik Lenstra.  Here&#x27;s a proof that there are infinitely many composites:<p>4 is composite, 6 is composite.  Suppose by way of contradiction that the set of all composites is finite.  Multiply them all together <i>and don&#x27;t add 1!</i>  That&#x27;s a new composite, hence contradiction.  QED.",1434917881

Unfortunately, there are bugs in all systems, so process-oriented thinking will always have a place. But in big picture terms - the &#x27;heart&#x27; of a security stance - you really do need to be thinking in this way, particularly at design time, and generally also as an attacker.<p>Unfortunately, a declarative (policy-driven) architecture is essentially useless unless you ensure the system actually follows policy... for instance, by actually generating it largely from policy. This degree of rigor is rare in practice, but highly desirable in theory.<p>If you want to ensure your skills target big picture, are applicable to building things and not just tearing them to pieces (which in the security world often decays in to a range of puerile one-upmanship as visible at most prominent industry events), you could consider specializing in this area. In that case, you would do well to learn about declarative DSLs (domain-specific languages) and learn some of the more common ones. Then, practice generating things (documentation, functional code, application-level proxies, protocol test suites, policy compliance test suites) from those definitions... the generation could be done in any language, though using something simple with lots of libraries would be smart (possibly go, ruby, python, even perl or php).<p>Just thought it was worth contributing a different perspective here.",1434917327

Power lines were never designed to be constant impedance, low loss and shielded for broadband frequencies. Due to all the impairments, the transmit power must be relatively high, and coupled with the poor shielding, interference with legitimate radio users is inevitable.",1434917142

They are by nature immune to piracy.<p>Taken Patreon and kickstarter. You can not pirate art which has not been created. An artist can decide how much wages they demand rather than find an other job, which incidental is how the job market works. If they agree to a certain amount, they get paid and do the work agreed on. Everyone walks away happy, the artist got paid, and art is created.<p>What is getting harder to do is getting repeatable paid for work you done in the past. Most programmers do work for hire, and they survive quite well on not being paid for every copy of work they once made. So long there is a strong interest for new work to be created, old work will be what validate the artist current pay.<p>I know a web comic that update twice a month and the author current gets paid $5k a month to do so. No copyright is involved, no police and no SOPA. Just an artist and their fans, enabled to be sustained by the basic model of people wanting more art to be created and a way for that to happen. When we describe the future as &quot;people doing things solely because they enjoy it&quot; we limit the market available to artist to how it was done in the past, and it seems artist themselves are instead choosing to find new ways rather than to close up shops.",1434916983

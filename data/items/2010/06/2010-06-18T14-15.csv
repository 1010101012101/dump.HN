It would include RSS from people like PG, you, Patrick, DGG etc. When I'm in the mood to read good article, I just go there and read it. Each of those blog entries links back to the original site comments and hopefully the HN thread. That way if I miss a really good HN discussion on some article you wrote because I was busy working that day, I still get to catch up on the article + discussion later at my disposal.<p>As a reader, I don't care how much money any of the syndicated bloggers make or don't make. Sure, I could just add you guys to my RSS readers but that means I have to find all the good hackers and manually deal with subscription etc. Plus I lose on the HN discussions. A PlanetHackerNews would take care of that. Hell, if someone makes it work well, I'll pay $5/month for it.",1276873177

So, is this weak security on the part of Posterous, or excellent social engineering on the part of robinduckett?

1442361,comment,1441726,1441726,0,0,illumin8,,,"I think his problems with the Drobo are mainly the way he's using it.  I've had a Drobo for a couple years now and have not had problems with it, but I have noticed a few strange things:<p>1.  Regarding the fan noise - I used to keep my Drobo in a warm house with no air conditioning.  Temperatures in my office would regularly reach 78-80 degrees, and anything in the high 70s would cause my Drobo fan to go into ""vacuum cleaner mode,"" which is really annoying.  Solution:  Don't keep your Drobo in a hot room.  This is a sensitive piece of electronic equipment with lots of spinning platters stacked on top of each other.  Drobo is more sensitive to heat than other pieces of technology.  Since then I keep my office air conditioned and at 72 degrees, the Drobo is silent other than the hard drive seeking itself.<p>2.  Filesystem support - This is a problem with any ""cross-platform"" storage and the fault is not Drobo's.  I use my Drobo on both an OS X 10.6.4 system and a Windows 7 system.  The only filesystem I can use that supports both seamlessly is FAT32.  Unfortunately, FAT32 doesn't support some character sets that Mac does, which I found out when I was trying to back up my iTunes library there.  Another limitation of FAT32 is that your filesystem can't be larger than 2TB, and you can't store files larger than 4GB.  My other option was to go with HFS+ or NTFS but either of those solutions are Mac or Windows only.<p>The two main issues he has:  Heat and filesystem compatibility, can be solved by simply using the Drobo differently.  Drobo is not without it's limitations.  The speed is slow, and it's sensitive to heat.  But if used properly, it works fine as a large data storage device.",1276872542

The declining CPU performance improvements seems to be leading to more rapid advancement on the storage and memory fronts.  Switching from a spinning disk to a ssd has resulted in the single largest performance improvement I've ever experienced in 20 years of computing.<p>Conversely, while multi-core computing doesn't deliver increased performance in the traditional way, I'd never want to work on a computer with a single processor again, no matter how fast it is.  The whole system can become unresponsive from the load of a single process.  Contrary to popular belief, many software applications do take advantage of concurrency, and it's not particularly hard to use concurrency to speed things up using multiple processes and messaging queues.<p>There is still room for plenty of improvements.  I personally would rather buy a 4-core processor with more on-die cache, than an 8 or 16 core processor at this point.  The major improvements I'm really looking for are faster and larger ssd drives; think equivalent to 4 256GB drives in a Raid 0 array with at least 60,000 IOPS, 1TB storage and 800MB/s read and write speeds.

If you're anything like Alex, you'll run screaming for the hills at this point, since it's built on MUMPS (it's an extension of Caché, ""postmodern MUMPS,"" which comes with everything from a web server to a blindingly fast SQL frontend). If you're not -- if you realize that it all compiles down to object code anyways, and what's important is programmer skill and code maintainability, not the presence of curly braces and variable declarations -- you'll keep reading. (Actually, Caché's version of MUMPS has both curly braces and variable declarations, although both are optional.)<p>Ensemble was designed to translate messages between incompatible healthcare databases, applying business rules in the process. It can be used for more than that; part of the training I had in the product (see below for my full disclosure) was using it to implement a simple loan acceptance protocol.<p>I think that its ""flowchart mode"" of execution might be very well suited to frequently-changing business rules. There's a video at <a href=""http://www.maddash.net/videos/intersystems/ensemble/vehr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maddash.net/videos/intersystems/ensemble/vehr/</a> which demonstrates this -- look at 7:15 for the flowchart (each element in it is programmable as necessary), and at 2:15 for the related flow through processing modules when something comes in.<p>You may be able to get a proof-of-concept demonstration -- see <a href=""http://www.intersystems.com/ensemble/pilot/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intersystems.com/ensemble/pilot/index.html</a> for details. Even if not, if this looks interesting, it wouldn't hurt to get in touch with Intersystems Sales.<p>Full disclosure: I work at Intersystems, but I'm not associated with Sales, and I really should be getting back to work. :)",1276871934

Having a protocol work over wifi is remarkably easier than having it work over 3G. The latter introduces clustering and latencies that you just don't have on any normal wifi. It's just as easy to assume that it is a bandwidth pig and is heavily susceptible to latency issues, which is why it is thus far limited to wifi.<p>Of course everyone else immediately <i>started</i> by making a solution work on 3G (and even edge), with wifi being a ""nice to have extras"" platform.<p>>I don't know what Gruber would say, but I can take a stab at it. I'd bet it would be along the lines of<p>When has Gruber ever said that? When the Android phones had dramatically better resolutions than the now almost intolerable iPhone 3GS and before, did Gruber ever commend that? In fact I believe the only time it even started to come up was when the iPhone 4 was an open secret and he knew it offered the new benchmark resolution, so suddenly competitive resolutions became a conversation point, but only from a ""they're behind what is coming"" angle.<p>How about Android notifications -- Gruber has defensively pushed back against the reality that Android has a dramatically better notification system. Yet, good for a laugh, he recently gushed that a notification expert from Palm (he was doing the ""See Android was just a copy cat anyways"" thing) was moving to Apple, clearly implying ""So soon it'll get a better notification system than the notification system that was a non-issue just yesterday"".<p>Gruber, to me, is like Republican talking heads of the worst kind. He filters information to see the world exactly the way he wants to see it to serve his agenda, which is to pimp Apple.",1276870812

On top of that, Russia's smartest and most ambitious people don't have the option of going into some technical field or academia, because that just doesn't provide a comfortable life. So they aim for power, and as a result the game of power is much more complicated than e.g. in America. For anyone interested in Russia, I suggest looking at more basic things, like what life is like for the average Russian.

When this happens they start justifying ""It was fine the old way, I don't see why they had to change it."".

Greensock (TweenMax) is without a doubt the best animation platform I&#x27;ve ever used. CSS3 animation gives you nowhere near the amount of fine grain control over animations that greensock provides. CSS3 is great for simple stuff, but for complex reactive timelines it&#x27;s basically impossible to work with. jQuery is OK for basic things that don&#x27;t need the performance, but is clunky is feels restrictive.<p><a href=""http://www.greensock.com/transitions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greensock.com/transitions/</a>",1372193983

This may be direct or indirect, elegant or inelegant, simple or complex.<p>Last night I helped analyze an issue on Manta regarding job run time, and used DTrace to measure all process run time from all servers. It was a lot of data, but easily awk&#x27;d (in this case, not enough data to warrant map reduce), at which point I found run times from a certain set of processes that were equivalent to the job latency - taking us towards the fix.<p>That&#x27;s just last night. A large number of real fixes have come from being able to quickly gather and process performance data, and from that spot latency outliers, unexpected workloads, and patterns over time.<p>I have spent time modeling systems. I wouldn&#x27;t say I was left feeling skeptical of data-driven analysis, rather, I was left appreciating how complex real computer systems are, which defy accurate modeling.

What services does a web application need? Generally speaking, a web process to handle requests, a database, and maybe some in-memory storage such as memcache. What docker can do is script the creation of these services as containers that can be deployed &quot;anywhere.&quot; So say you have your web app now, and your 3 services are on a single server and the load is getting heavy because of database queries. Docker makes it extremely easy to reliably move the services between servers to handle the load better.<p>Albeit this is a very simplified vision, I don&#x27;t think the complete use cases for docker have been hashed out quite yet. tl;dr dev ops is about to get magnitudes easier.",1372193671

The minimal syntax makes it harder to read than more traditional languages.<p>I personally find that the minimal syntax makes it much easier to read the code.<p>The more syntax the language has the more of it you have to keep in your head when reading code. Different language features might interact in unexpected ways, and so on. This is mental overhead that I don&#x27;t need to worry about when the syntax is regular.<p>>2. It&#x27;s uncomfortable to do imperative or object-oriented programming in Clojure. (Yes, many problems are easier to express in other than the functional paradigm.)<p>Could this stem from the fact that you&#x27;re likely much more familiar with OO and you&#x27;ve spent years internalizing OO patterns for solving problems.<p>I find that for majority of problems I deal with functional solutions tend to be simpler, cleaner, and more reusable.<p>OO on the other hand is directly at odds with reuse because you marry logic and data together into classes. If you write a method and you need to use it for a different problem, you often have to jump through hoops to do it.<p>On top of it OO encourages premature classification. If you create a class and you need to use that data in a different way later you have to translate it in some way. This is why you have things like wrapper and adapter patterns.<p>This problem simply doesn&#x27;t exist in functional code. You simply group functions into a namespace that has same organizational benefits as a class. A namespace can represent a specific domain, but you can easily pass the output of a function from one namespace to a function in a different namespace.<p>>4. The parentheses are sometimes annoying, especially when I want to quickly test something in the REPL.<p>There&#x27;s a lot less control characters in Clojure than say in Java. If you count all your parens, curly brackets, semicolons, commas, and so a language like Java has far more noise in it. There are very few languages that have cleaner significantly syntax in my opinion.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re using a proper editor you rarely have to deal with something like balancing parens by hand.<p>>From my experince, this is just wishful thinking.<p>From my experience, actually having worked with Clojure production systems for a few years, now macros can be incredibly helpful in expressing problems cleanly and removing boilerplate.",1372192858

So, surgeons have the patient awake and talking etc. to make sure they are not hitting the internal capsule (which would be bad for movement etc.) and then have access to multiple leads which they activate in turn to see which leads are best at mitigating symptoms (i.e. are activating/deactivating the appropriate structure)<p>What I am very excited about is the concept of neurotrophic chemicals on electrode leads. These chemicals encourage neurons to grow processes towards them, thereby making a better and longer lasting connection with the electrode.<p>If we ever get to a Neuromancer/Matrix like future where we &#x27;jack in&#x27; our  brains, I think neurotrophic electrodes with very fine spacing will be part of the technology, so that we can activate many neurons in many different patterns in a well controlled manner.",1372191456

Screw-tops are associated with cheap wine, so any wine that has one and still commands a market price above bargain basement ($2-$10) is likely decent.<p>- Also, European countries heavily subsidize the wine industry, so it&#x27;s possible to get great wine for around 8.  In America those might end up costing $15-$20 but they are still a better value than most $30-$40 American wine (which is overpriced b/c of the super expensive real estate it is grown on and lack of subsidy).",1372190654

To me, either something is interesting or is not, from day one.<p>Just to give a different perspective: personally I&#x27;ve only had one employer since I started working 9 years ago, so I&#x27;m nearly at that 10 year stretch. I&#x27;ve changed technology several times while there, usually by proposing the change myself. I&#x27;ve also changed what sort of product I&#x27;ve worked on many times. Whenever the work becomes boring because a project goes into maintenance mode, I decide I want to work on something fresh and make it happen.",1372190422

Starting a new metro newspaper makes zero sense today, but launching a voting site for a city and then backing it up with a cadre of investigative reporters who would dig deeper into the stories that made the front page is something I've dreamed of getting off the ground for a while.<p>I was hoping Reddit's open code would give me the vehicle, but it's now clear that's not the case unless I get a hacker on my team.  Any takers?<p>Pligg sucks.  Drupal will work but it's kind of a pain. I'd been anxiously awaiting this announcement because I hoped the Reddit code would give us something to work with.<p>However when I visit code.reddit.com, all I see is stuff I don't understand.  I'm no hacker, but I've developed Drupal and WP sites. However I don't know the foggiest about Python, Subversion or any of the other things listed under the dependencies.  This is very disappointing.  How do they expect their code to be deployed when it requires a hacker to set it up?<p>If anyone on here is interested in getting involved in what I believe would be a groundbreaking journalism effort, shoot me an e-mail at methodista@lawnparty.net<p>Note: I have no funding at all.  Simply a concept and the means to launch a handful of trained journalists at news stories that merit more attention and follow-up.

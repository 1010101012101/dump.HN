8616786,comment,8616755,8616755,0,0,ubertaco,,,"It&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t think you <i>can</i> know security AND write PHP, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s seen as very uncommon, largely because of historical context and PHP&#x27;s ecosystem.<p>PHP, as you probably know, started as a really basic (if obtuse) preprocessor for HTML pages. It plugged nicely into Apache via mod_php, and was relatively simple and low-footprint to set up, so a lot of cheap shared-hosting sites set it up. For beginning/inexperienced web developers on small projects, this was great; you no longer had to go host your own Java/ASP/whatever web server to have server-side logic, now you could just use a text editor and FTP.<p>Unfortunately, this also meant that PHP attracted a <i>lot</i> of inexperienced developers -- the kind who haven&#x27;t yet learned things like why you should hash (and salt) your passwords, why you should use stored procedures, and so on. (Editorial: it didn&#x27;t help that the language itself didn&#x27;t, at the time at least, make it obvious how to do such things.)<p>Granted, there were some developers who knew better who picked up PHP. But generally developers who have some working knowledge of web security best practices get that knowledge by working in the field -- which at the time, typically meant &quot;heavier-weight&quot; stuff like Java or ASP.<p>So with large numbers of inexperienced, security-unaware devs enabled to write webapps in PHP, large amounts of poor, insecure PHP code was written. So PHP got a bad rep, which only exacerbated the problem by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that turned companies who could hire more-experienced devs off from PHP.<p>I haven&#x27;t personally touched PHP in a long while -- I personally just don&#x27;t like some aspects of the language -- but I&#x27;ve heard some steps have been made in the PHP community to make best-practices more easy/commonplace. Which is great! But the old reputation is still there, and bad reputations are hard to dispel -- especially in the corporate world.",1416196709

8616770,comment,8615224,8616336,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Ockham&#x27;s razor is a terrible heuristic, and one of the reasons the Multiverse view gets so much skepticism is that Ockham&#x27;s razor is the best argument for it.<p>Consider: Ockham himself believed that &quot;not multiplying entities beyond necessity&quot; was an argument for the existence of God and <i>an argument against the existence of everything else.</i> That is, once you had an omnipotent god, everything else was just a product of that god&#x27;s imagination. This idea wasn&#x27;t necessarily original to Ockham, but he was one of it&#x27;s more notable proponents.<p>Furthermore, &quot;simplicity&quot; is an extremely wobbly concept. To a circularist, elliptical orbits are horribly complex, as they have to be approximated by an infinite series of epicycles. Acknowledge ellipses as primary and they become simple: adding just one parameter over circles. There are of course fairly objective measures of complexity (Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity) but neither of them apply very nicely to the kind of conceptual arguments where Ockham&#x27;s razor is typically introduce.<p>Finally, we know that there is exactly one consistent way to update our beliefs in the face of new evidence: Bayes&#x27; rule. Since it is very simple, we don&#x27;t really need to invoke any additional heuristics like Ockham&#x27;s razor. And we find, in fact, that in the few cases where Ockham&#x27;s razor makes sense it is nothing but a consequence of Bayes&#x27; rule, and can be expressed as follows:<p>In cases where two causes would give rise to the same evidence with roughly equal probability, and one cause has a much higher prior plausibility, the presence of the evidence means that cause is the more likely of the two.<p>That is, &quot;When you hear hoofbeats think horses not zebras&quot; is a good idea in most cases because the prior plausibility of &quot;There are horses around&quot; is a whole lot higher in most cases than that of &quot;There are zebras around&quot;. The presence of hoofbeats raises the plausibility of both propositions by exactly the same amount, but the ratio between them remains the same, so the evidence is most likely evidence of horses, not zebras.",1416196026

Bad decision making ruins everyone&#x27;s quality of life who participates.  This is in large part what makes places like 4chan and Reddit not great in my eyes.  Some of the moderation policies here on HN are also highly suspect as well, and it is reflected in some of the comments you see here and in some other posts.<p>Communities have often proven bad stalwarts of proper decorum and respectfulness - you can see it quite often in forums or boards of various types and various subjects.  4chan, Reddit, HN, sports forums, video game forums, etc.  More community run forums tend to devolve into chaos, where many otherwise good people who would normally stand up to abusive behavior end up leaving since they get drowned in a sea of mob rule.  The only way I have been able to see this situation get stopped is by strong moderation, since they have special authority to make or break situations.  However, moderation also has to be mindful of the community as well - some actions, even if right, can drive away people.  Communities can mold around how a moderator behaves, so one has to be careful not to be too strong armed.<p>It&#x27;s a delicate tightrope one has to walk as a moderator, and one managing moderators.",1416195943

8616752,comment,8615962,8616419,0,0,mtanski,,,"A couple points about RedHat:<p>First, it develops almost everything out in the open. That includes developers communicating with their coworkers through public mailing lists for those projects. Sometimes those are hosted by Redhat but most often they are hosed by other projects governance (free desktop, kernel, openjdk). When it comes to those projects employees end up communicating on the list instead of internal or in person to make sure everybody has access to the communication. Most OSS ran by companies loved here on HN (Google, Fb, etc) has development happen on internal lists with occasional code dumps.<p>Second, for almost all projects started by Redhat employees do not require copy right assignment. Yes, I know Fedora has something for their project but that seams to be an exception. No copyright assignment on systemd or many gnome sub-projects they started. Compare that again to OSS from Google, FB and even Ubuntu (upstart requires copy right assignment).<p>Third, and contrary to what you just said... YES YOU CAN FORK IT. It happens all the time. People build one person distros all the time (or obscure distros with a small group of volunteers). Hell, somebody even forked systemd (new project: useslessd) to remove things he considers bad.<p>So, in conclusion, what you call a compelling case is nothing more then argument on thin ice... at least in my eyes given the evidence. Technically they can exert control over the projects if they employ the maintainer. But, given the facts they not setup in a position to exploit it and given the current status quo we should see it coming.<p>I&#x27;m not affiliated with Redhat; I don&#x27;t run Redhat; I know some people who work / worked at Redhat in past.",1416195645

My personal philosophy is that designing a GUI should only be done in a wysiwyg interface. If you create a GUI using code alone, there is a certain disconnection with the design which can lead to poor interfaces especially if you are on a tight deadline and is trying to keep the UI as simple as possible. My belief is that code should be strictly used for business logic only and everything else should be left to the compiler and IDE. Many fail to understand my preference for using VB for scripting purposes instead of a &quot;nicer&quot; language such as Python or Ruby. To me the GUI builder is one of the most important tools, many developers fail to understand that most end-users would rather click on a menu than type in the commandline even though sometimes it may be faster. What we should be doing now is making more powerful IDEs so that the GUI builder abstractions are less leaky.",1416194843

I would agree with them, I think most people who are going to use the web interface of Gmail are casual users and the UI changes work well for them.<p>Given Google&#x27;s immense size, I&#x27;m very glad they&#x27;re taking this approach...attempting to satisfy both the casual emailer and the power user and still providing a great service behind the scenes.",1416194497

I don&#x27;t think she knows what she&#x27;s talking about as far as the science goes -- I&#x27;m far from an expert, but I believe most cooking oils will polymerize through exposure to oxygen and heat -- it doesn&#x27;t require special drying oils.<p>There&#x27;s a traditional black smith&#x27;s finish to make an almost indestructible coating by rubbing some beeswax on steel heated to the smoke point... I imagine it&#x27;s the same process when seasoning a cast iron pan with cooking oil.<p>BTW, There seem to be a lot of people looking for cast iron pans... Keep a lookout at garage sales and swap meets. You can usually find pans without too much trouble, and for around $5--$10 or so.<p>As far as seasoning goes, I just wipe some olive oil on and heat it &#x27;till it smokes, let it sit, and repeat three or so times. As far as I can tell the oil forms a tough plastic-like coating. The only thing that&#x27;ll damage it in normal use is cutting into it with a sharp knife or the edge of a spatula, or burning the coating off by getting the pan too hot. Flax oil max stick less, or be slightly better in some other way, but I doubt there is much of a difference.",1416194496

It seems to have elements of both.  Snooze is a great feature for people practicing Inbox-zero (which anyone getting hundreds of emails a day and remaining sane likely is doing).  The increased automation of filters, and the addition of bundles in the inbox all help.<p>On the other hand, the reduced compose window size, the removal of read message counts within labels, the inability to nest labels, the inability to specify advanced filters, and more, make Inbox (at least without occasional use of gmail) inappropriate for power users.<p>This article (at least the final paragraph) seems to suggest that Inbox is the power app designed for email-firehose users, but in its current implementation it appears more useful for the everyday user who wouldn&#x27;t bother to manually set up filters for recurring emails (and could instead just use the new &quot;sweep&quot; feature).<p>Anyway, I very much hope they continue to develop both products, and continue to support their inter-operation, as well as porting features between them.  (Snooze in gmail-proper would be great, for instance.  Advanced filters in Inbox aren&#x27;t really necessary, since they can be managed from gmail.  Read message counts and a decent compose window are, though.)<p>As long as both products maintain a decent user base, perhaps this best case scenario will play out.  On the other hand, if a feature-poor (but sufficient for most users) Inbox gains the majority of the market share, I could see gmail going the way of Reader, which would obviously be a shame.",1416194464

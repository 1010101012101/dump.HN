4017904,comment,4010297,4013664,1,0,quaunaut,,,"You really should learn what an ad hominem attack is. If I say you're ignorant and clueless on the topics of labor in economies, based upon what you've said about labor in economies, that's not ad-hominem. That's just resorting to insulting you. However, I shouldn't have done it in the first place, and for that I apologize.<p>Currently, America has an estimated 11.4% of it's workers in a Union. These are people who universally are working jobs where they are getting better benefits/pay/work conditions than if there were not a Union. Now, considering that the majority of Union jobs are for positions not requiring college degrees, you're looking at a situation of helping the most vulnerable members of society still afford to live on a year to year basis- those who are least valuable to the economic system. To take away Unions, in the vast majority of cases, would cause a few basic results-<p>* Lowering of hourly pay
* Removal of benefits
* Worsening of work conditions<p>Now, I could take the reasonable argument that the first and third options would probably stay static in over half of the cases if Unions were to be removed. But without a Union, I don't think that suddenly these companies are going to decide to pick up paying for benefits. While some companies involved with unions pay for their employees' benefits, once again, the majority are given benefits <i>by the union</i>, including health and life insurance at the least, and many include more than that. So you're looking at the very least, with more people unable to afford healthcare.<p>In the end, yes, the members of the union don't pay out that money to dues- but this won't be enough to afford the benefits they have otherwise. And that means they won't be able to afford many of the other things in their lives, such as houses, cars, or most luxury items. You could make the argument, 'Their job isn't worth that much, they shouldn't be able to do that.', but remember- Unions are largely made up of those who couldn't afford to go back to college in the first place. Less and less young people are joining Unions because most of the newer, more modern industries don't have them. Essentially, unless you're going into government work or healthcare, you'll most likely be outside of the union system.<p>And this is all avoiding the basic point, that once again- there are a lot of jobs out there right now, that would be wholeheartedly unsafe without a Union pushing back at the employer. And not just unsafe because of simple things like railings, or dangerous locations- but things like overworking employees, dangerous weather conditions, etc. And many companies, even those under Unions, are still able to keep many of these conditions on their employees because the Union is either too new or just doesn't have enough leverage.",1337860373

4017895,comment,4017686,4017686,10,0,gioele,,,"The crux of the question:<p>> Bill Venners: But aren't you breaking their code in that case anyway, even in a language without checked exceptions? If the new version of foo is going to throw a new exception that clients should think about handling, isn't their code broken just by the fact that they didn't expect that exception when they wrote the code?<p>> Anders Hejlsberg: No, because in a lot of cases, people don't care. They're not going to handle any of these exceptions. There's a bottom level exception handler around their message loop. That handler is just going to bring up a dialog that says what went wrong and continue. The programmers protect their code by writing try finally's everywhere, so they'll back out correctly if an exception occurs, but they're not actually interested in handling the exceptions.<p>> The throws clause, at least the way it's implemented in Java, doesn't necessarily force you to handle the exceptions, but if you don't handle them, it forces you to acknowledge precisely which exceptions might pass through. It requires you to either catch declared exceptions or put them in your own throws clause. To work around this requirement, people do ridiculous things. For example, they decorate every method with, ""throws Exception."" That just completely defeats the feature, and you just made the programmer write more gobbledy gunk. That doesn't help anybody.",1337860232

4017838,comment,4017122,4017670,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Well, I oversimplified a bit, it's actually a bit more complicated than either description in terms of the incremental costs. The theoretical marginal cost of adding an additional Shuttle flight to the manifest is around $110 mil, but that doesn't include certain necessary operational costs (astronaut training and handling, etc.). It's a difficult thing to estimate accurately and sort of moot regardless because of the extreme limitations due to the small size of the Orbiter fleet and the amount of time it takes to refurbish them after each launch.<p>As far as the average annual cost you have to keep in mind that the total amount of money spent on Shuttle operations was more than just the spending on the Shuttle's standing army of maintenance workers. There was additional Shuttle related spending that in total added up to a figure of about a billion dollars per flight. Also keep in mind that near the end of the program the flight rate was quite low, and was often only 3 or 4 a year. Additionally, the Shuttle expenditures were higher back in the mid '80s than in the 2000s, when adjusted for inflation, so even though the flight rate was higher the per launch cost was similar (the best time being in 1985 when they managed 9 flights with a budget of $5.6 bil (in 2010 dollars)). Up through the 80s and 90s there were a few good years where the cost per flight was as low as $600 mil, but in mediocre year that cost could be as much as $1.2 bil, and in a bad couple of years that cost could be as much as $5 bil or even $7 bil (in the 3 year periods just after the Challenger and Columbia disasters, for example).<p>For SpaceX, much of what keeps their costs low is just bog standard common sense. The biggest problem in spaceflight over the last 4 decades has been a lack of common sense.<p>Consider a few salient points. The more components you add to a vehicle the less reliable and more costly it is to operate. One big problem that typical launch vehicles have had is being undersized. And this comes because nobody thinks to build any margin into the design. During the Apollo program Von Braun sandbagged the Saturn V's quoted payload capability, knowing that the Apollo spacecraft would go over its mass budget. Instead of having to go back to the drawing board, everything was fine because the Saturn V was scaled to take into account that overrun. These are the sorts of things that we know are common. But what has happened with so many vehicles is that they end up adding on solid fueled boosters to the vehicle to increase the payload capacity. Well, this dramatically changes the engineering of the whole beast, and makes the vehicle less safe and more expensive in the processes. It's better to scale the vehicle right from the get go and avoid using solid rockets at all. If you look at the Falcon 9 you can see where that has been a huge advantage to them, allowing them to do an on pad abort and a fast recycle without endangering the mission even when there was a problem with the rocket. And it also makes range safety a lot easier.<p>Then you have the fascination with using LOX/LH2 in lower stages. The earliest orbital launchers typically used LOX and Kerosene. This is a very straightforward design with a lot of advantages because the high density of Kerosene and the relatively mild cryogenic character of LOX allows you to achieve very high mass ratios on lower stages using little more than ordinary airplane grade engineering and a modicum of thermal shielding. LOX/LH2 has a higher Isp though, and it produces stages with a lower total weight so you can create a launcher with a lower ""GLOW"" (gross liftoff weight). Each of these factors has been enormously enticing to launch vehicle designers for decades and has got a hold of their minds regardless of common sense. The downsides of LH2 in a lower stage are extreme. It is super-cryogenic so it requires a lot of specialty construction and extra insulation in the fuel tanks. Moreover, it is very low density so it requires using exotic materials (such as Al-Li alloys) to achieve reasonable mass ratios. The thing is, rocket performance scales exponentially with respect to both mass ratio and Isp, so it's important to make a smart tradeoff between them. As far as GLOW, it's just a number, and it doesn't mean a whole lot since most of it is just propellant which is cheap compared to the total cost of the vehicle. If you were making a very low cost vehicle then GLOW might be a concern, but we are about 2 orders of magnitude away from that realm so focusing on it is actually an extreme anti-optimization. Worse yet, LOX/LH2 tends to generate less thrust than LOX/Kerosene for similar rocket engine sizes, so often (as is the case with Ariane V, the Shuttle, the Japanese H-IIA, and others) LH2 fueled rockets rely on the extra thrust of solid boosters to get the vehicle off the ground. This adds complexity, cost, and reduces reliability and safety.<p>Now, there is also the annoying idea that ""simple"" rocket designs such as an ordinary 2 stage LOX/Kerosene booster are old hat, they've been done, they're outmoded technology. New rockets need to make use of more cutting edge technology such as reusable space planes, or linear aerospike engines, or SSTOs, or helicopter/rocket hybrids. The fallacy here is that we hadn't explored simple rocket designs nearly enough. There's nothing wrong with taking a proven, traditional design and making it even simpler, more robust, more reliable, and reducing cost.<p>And that's exactly what SpaceX has been doing. Their rocket design is not the smartest or most innovative launch vehicle in history, it's actually closest to the dumbest possible idea that's workable. Why not build a 2-stage LOX/Kerosene rocket and put a capsule on top of it? It's not a new idea, it's not innovative, it's not high-tech. It's a design that would be intimately familiar to anyone who had worked on the Saturn IB rocket or the Gemini capsule or the Soyuz rocket / spacecraft going back nearly 50 years ago. Granted, they've put a lot of high-tech work into the vehicle, but it is ultimately just a very common sense design. The only reason nobody else has done the same sort of thing is because they haven't had the guts.<p>Once you start from there, with a foundation of making sound design and business decisions based on good, well rounded common sense then the benefits to the whole system flow out from there. Then you can avoid red tape and bureaucracy and make the sensible decision based on the full truth at each step, which tends to have a multiplicative effect. The end result being a company like SpaceX, which even when it does little more than launch boring rocket designs into orbit nevertheless revolutionizes the entire industry, because no one else had thought that boring could be so smart.",1337859009

4017830,comment,4016658,4016950,5,0,jonnathanson,,,"The botttom line with Facebook is that it went public far too early. It doesn't have its footing on solid ground as far as revenue growth, stability, and profitability are concerned. Its advertising model, dependent as it is on these much-maligned targeted display ads, is promising -- but has a lot of kinks to be worked out. The more I look at the Facebook IPO, the more I <i>don't</i> see the conventional narrative, i.e., that the company itself is a flop, or that its ad model is inherently flawed. Rather, I see a company that was forced to IPO before its time, by taking on too many private investors and too much private funding. Furthermore, I see a bunch of the people behind that private funding basically giving Facebook as shiny of a paintjob as possible in order to make its public debut. But the paint was applied hastily, and it's all flaky and spotty at the big show.<p>To me, this cautionary tale is every bit as much about VC funding bubbles as it is about advertising bubbles. Sure, Facebook could never have been bootstrapped to its current scale. But it could have stopped taking on such massive amounts of funding, and, instead, opted for more organic growth until it found time to perfect its ad products and business model.<p>When we talk about the Dotcom Bubble of the mid 90s, we talk about a frenzied funding (and IPOing) of companies with little more than userbases and unproven (or occasionally nonsensical) business models. Facebook is not that, exactly. It's more userbase than business, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Unfortunately, it was funded (excessively) in Dotcom Bubble fashion, and forced to IPO in Dotcom Bubble mode: grow insanely fast, worry about profitability later.<p>That it happened to benefit, temporarily, from a misguided advertising bubble is material, but also somewhat incidental.",1337858874

They can target ""friends of friends"" of people who appear to have a particular target interest (for example), but that's going to have a lot of noise because of the social noise.<p>2)  When people lie by spending real dollars, at least their spending real money.  And they are actually saying something.  Maybe it's not ""I'm a race car driver"", but ""I'm interested in race cars"".   The trick is understanding what it is they are saying.",1337857832

- It's a recruiting platform like The Resumator, or Jobvite, but with a job board built in. It also adds social data to job listings and to job applications - so each job listing will also show a list of people who recommend working there. If you're an employer, when people apply for you job, it shows you a list of your team members who choose to follow the applicant on Twitter.<p>Companies could find it useful because recruiting is extremely hard - there's a low signal to noise ratio, so you might get lots of job applications from people who aren't really suitable, and only a few applications from people who are great. Moki helps you spot the people who are most likely to fit in quicker. Job seekers can find it useful because jobs listed aren't from recruitment agencies - they're from the actual company themselves - you can see a profile page of the company that explains their culture, office & perks and you can see a list of people who recommend working there.<p>It works, hopefully, seamlessly - companies list jobs in the same way they would with a regular job board and people apply for jobs directly on Moki, filling in a form on the site. The only difference is that you need to log in through Twitter to sign up. Nothing is ever automatically tweeted from their account.<p>As you can see - I've not quite found a way to word the concept elegantly yet. Thanks again for the feedback - I genuinely appreciate it.",1337857814

This makes it more difficult to reason about.<p>2) Configuration management is too low level: One should not describe the state of configuration to keep, but the desided behavoiur of the system. The configuration part should be automatically derived.<p>3) Configuration management breaks locality: If a config manager is running, the point of change of the system is not in the config files anymore. If I have a problem and the documented solution tells me to change a particular configuration, an additional step is added toward the solution.

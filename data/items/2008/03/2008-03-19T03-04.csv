140526,comment,140142,140142,0,0,smook,,,"Back in 1972, @ Univeristy of Toronto, Engineering Science we took PL/C. Most of us used APL (A Programming Language) to write quick and fast code on the fly. Where did that language go ? Remember I.P.Sharpe Associates? Time-sharing? Ouch, this dates me. I'm running an ISP in Toronto now and hiring graduates, but find many think they can programme, but they cannot ""problem-solve""!  Too bad most of the Universities are giving us programmers but no network ip people. (They seem to be self-taught, like the best ones...!) My son currently in second year Chemical Engineering is just using some C++ and MathLAB. My younger son will be entering UofT for Engineering Science in FALL 2008, and they are asking all students to enroll in a summer class for programming if they wish to be accepted into EngSci.  I'm hoping that the Universities keep up the push to stay-up-to-date with the current programming languages. Good luck to all you new noobs.",1205898963

140524,comment,139380,139779,0,0,davidbirk,,,"I think you're right about the cost & time increases for building hardware, but I'm not sure many fundamental changes would be required for hardware startups.<p>If the hardware mod. can be approximated fairly well by computer simulations then the same model should work fairly well, IMHO.  The goal would still be 'build what people want' and 'excite the Angels' right?<p>For any machine that is currently being built, someone, somewhere is an expert in whatever part the startup is seeking to improve.  If the machine is being sold, buyers know what they are looking for and can give meaningful feedback.  So the startup simply needs to convince the experts / investors of the value of their new technology, market size & demand, their ability to execute, etc.<p>For Tony Wright's “car that runs on lemonade” example, the startup would have 3 months at YC HQ to convince enough experts in the field of internal combustion engines that lemonade is a sufficiently better fuel than gasoline to justify further R&D work.  Then, Angel investors can make a relatively informed decision about project risk vs potential rewards.<p>Increased risk would need to be balanced by increased upside, but I'm thinking that with computer-based tools, hardware hacking is not that different than software hacking.<p>What do you think?",1205898840

They talk a lot about loans backed by securities and bonds and whatnot. I'm reading Greenspan's new book and I'm a little confused about what securities and bonds.  I think a bond is something I can buy (from the fed) that says, ""If you buy this now, I will pay you it back with 5% interest in x years"" - But are there more examples of bonds?  Can I buy them from companies? (I can be me, or a company)<p>I'm also confused as to why exactly bear-sterns tanked.  If I'm reading correctly they basically had a lot of loans that people called in that they couldn't pay.  But why did all these loans all get called in at once?",1205898469

In other words, if money has diminishing marginal utility, then each dollar is worth less than the one before it. To use the example before, the first $1000 might be worth $1000 to a person, and the second $1000 worth only $950 (in terms of utility). This would not be ""loss aversion"" but just a phenomenon adequately explained by economic theory.""",1205898398

I wish I was in that area.<p>But I think the principle still holds - if you are going to be replacing ad views that are automatically and reliably earning $45 CPM then you need a reason to do it. The 2 good reasons I can think of are 
1. More money. 50% more to make up for your extra costs
2. You want to diversify your income so if adsense ever went bad you would be in a better position.<p>Maybe if you had an automated ordering system where people payed you upfront you could go lower but otherwise I just don't see how it is worth it.<p>I agree with the sponsorships idea though.<p>Let me know if you are keen to sell me some of that ad  space for less than google returns :)",1205897193

140496,comment,140269,140269,0,0,newt0311,,,"Wow. That sounded like slashdot. Please reasoned cool-headed rational arguments please.<p>First argument: This self-fulfilling prophecy has been brought to you by Google Adsense: funding Slashdot trolls since 2003.<p>What does this even mean? Does it have any substance?<p>Second argument: I demand documented standards with open reference implementations. That’s why I only develop with Microsoft technologies.<p>How does this counter the point that there is no reference implementation for web standards. What Joe did or did not do is completely irrelevant to the discussion as hand.<p>Third argument: No one has ever written tools to encapsulate the world’s collective understanding of standards; you must start from scratch like everybody else. Freedom 0 buys you nothing unless you can audit the source code yourself. “Faith” in science is no more well-founded than “faith” in religion unless you can personally reproduce the experiments.<p>This is the closest that the article comes to actually making a reasonable point. Even then, it doesn't go very far. Instead of clearly stating the point, the author just uses sarcasm. Sarcasm is very effective in arguments but only as support, not as the core.<p>Fourth argument: Hi, I’m Web Developer Barbie. Pull my string and I say, “Standards are tough! Let’s go shopping!”<p>This is ridiculous. Is there any evidence attached either way? At least Joe added an excerpt of a standards document. I have read standards documents before. I didn't find them illegible but reading them was a painful experience. It is not a very far leap to assume that there are many web developers who will not put in the time required to understand them completely.<p>Fifth argument: I have never heard of test suites.<p>Actually, Joe addressed this point specifically as follows: There is no practical way to check if the web page you just coded conforms to the spec. There are validators, but they won’t tell you what the page is supposed to look like, and having a “valid” page where all the text is overlapping and nothing lines up and you can’t see anything is not very useful. What people do is check their pages against one browser, maybe two, until it looks right. And if they’ve made a mistake that just happens to look OK in IE and Firefox, they’re not even going to know about it.<p>Sixth argument: I am high as a kite.<p>See arguments 1, 2, and 4.<p>Seventh argument: Wait… you mean you can… see what I’m typing?<p>See argument 6.<p>Eighth argument: Microsoft has always had the best interests of the web at heart. Microsoft has never encouraged web developers to use Microsoft-specific technologies. Microsoft has never shipped a browser that rendered pages differently than its predecessor and then let it stagnate for six years while the rest of the world moved on.<p>Yes, MS does have a jaded record when it comes to supporting standards. It may be entirely their fault that we have this standards mess with IE now. How does that have any bearing on Joe's prediction?<p>Ninth argument: I know IE is going to continue to lose a lot of market share, and I’m publishing this now so I can blame you dirty fucking hippies for it later.<p>This is ridiculous. Can we please have reasoned criticism where we do not resort to ad hominem attacks and/or act like 13 year olds?",1205895992

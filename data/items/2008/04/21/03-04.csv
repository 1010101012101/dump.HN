Of course, they'll be around for a long time, much like IBM, and be profitable for many eons to come, but they aren't a source of innovation or inspiration anymore.",1208749822

Surely some are, but for a very long time now the kinds of people who make great engineers have shifted en masse either to going their own way (startups) or to working at Google, Facebook, or a number of other places.",1208748458

169031,comment,168635,168635,0,0,indiejade,,,"Yes.  Though I would hesitate to endorse a particular degree of ""added value"" from an ivy-league branded MBA.  Do a simple cost-benefit analysis.<p>It occurred to me, during graduate studies for my MBA (at a lovely state University, thank you very much), how various disciplines have their different lingo.  Perhaps the most valuable thing I got from the program was instilled by osmosis -- the lingo associated with a variety of disciplines, industries, etc.<p>If anything, an MBA teaches you the lingo of lingos; that is, it doesn't so much teach how to be a ""generalist"" (as was stated earlier), but more about how to be a ""relativist"".  There are interesting problems to be solved in a variety of industries, and knowing both l33t and business speak puts you in a much better position for dealing with a variety of different people.",1208747975

169027,comment,168636,168788,0,0,wensing,,,"Digi-Key is certainly not the only ones in this space that doesn't want price comparisons.  What about McMaster-Carr?  Not a chance in the world they are going to open up their pricing and availability to an Octopart site.  Why?  Well, I can't speak for them (although I worked there for 2.5 years), but I would guess it's because they want to maintain control.  I don't think that necessarily makes them evil, however, because control can mean controlling the customer experience for the better.  In other words, perhaps someone could legitimately believe that Octopart is an inferior (non-innovative) approach to part search, and that allowing your products to be searchable via Octopart would confuse and hurt, rather than help, your customers.<p>Your comparison to travel is an interesting one, because despite Travelocity/Orbitz/Kayak/etc. some airlines (Southwest) can still only be searched via their site.  Ironically (despite the recent fiasco) I would consider Southwest to be a very innovative, pleasurable-to-fly airline.",1208747843

169023,comment,168750,168750,0,0,staunch,,,"I think for many seemingly simple web apps there's a huge payoff to spending lots of time adding serious behind-the-scenes brains. It's an especially great competitive advantage because it's invisible. Competitors won't even know how important that part of your system is to winning, so they'll hopefully never even try to implement something similar.<p>Max Levchin fighting fraud better than his competitors using sophisticated analysis/number crunching is a good example.",1208747438

I used to go straight to American Airlines to buy tickets and that was fine but how much nicer is it to buy tickets online now? I even travel more because it is easier to find things.</i><p>It is definitely nicer to buy tickets, but the race to the bottom in pricing has made the flying experience itself (not just the airport) a misery. There are predominately two options - be miserable with everyone for whom price trumps all (see also Walmart) or spend much, much more for a decent experience.  There is no choice of spending 20% more to have a 20% better experience.<p>So while I value the ease of search and the low prices it precipitates, I am concerned that price competition will force a decline (or a polarization) in customer service.  And maybe it is unavoidable.",1208746800

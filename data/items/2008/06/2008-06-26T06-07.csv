228329,comment,228233,228316,0,0,DaniFong,,,"That may well be true, but I think the problem of disentangling the incredibly powerful Jewish cultural influence (or any other cultural, influence, really, as a half-asian I can tell you my heritage helped push me) from whatever biological differences there might be is an incredibly tricky one. So I think that asserting such conclusions here is either chauvinist or premature.",1214461941

228326,comment,227859,227890,0,0,ken,,,"So apps written in C never segfault?  Proprietary platforms always have great tech support?  Other programming languages always have same-day fixes?  I won't make any particular claims about Ruby, but I have yet to see The Perfect Language.  Every language in the world is ""bad, bad platform choice"" given <i>some</i> criteria.<p>Moreover, from reading the advisories and comments, the only thing I can tell for certain is that you can kill a Ruby process with something like ""Array.new[0x7fffffff]=0"".  The only way that's going to take down a Rails app is if you're putting unchecked user input directly into array indices -- but then, if you're doing that, you're probably in trouble anyway.<p>Or if you're running a setup like Heroku, and you let users run a Ruby console.  (Maybe.  I don't actually know how Heroku works.)  To the nearest percent, that describes 0% of Rails apps.<p>Can anybody describe how this would actually be used to attack a typical website running Rails?",1214461611

RescueTime on the other hand hasn't really done anything for me (except take up 100% CPU a few times). I may be in a minority on that one.",1214460952

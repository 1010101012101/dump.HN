Fluid dynamics is nonlinear, and complicated, but certain effects, such as lift, or drag, are both simple and broadly applicable. So it is with radiative models of global heat balance. Heat powers the climate! Altering CO2 will alter the flux of infrared radiation which will alter the flux of heat. This basic mechanism is uncontested. I could be that the total heat flux doesn't change much because it's balanced by other effects. But we know of no other effects sufficiently strong to render the temperature change small. If we have a physically plausible model that fits measured datapoints, and we keep check its predictions against measurements, and we keep asking 'in which ways might this be different?' and looking for possible problems, or effects that we've missed, then this is science at work. If instead we say ""it's complicated, and there are some areas in which there are gaps in understanding, therefore we should draw no conclusions and make no decisions,"" we achieve little.",1225947392

Disregard this comment if you were referring to the list as a whole.<p>Aucto was a talent acquisition, which is obviously fine. The founders got relatively rich and can be considered successful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there were 4 founders so afters taxes, fees & TPS they probably walked away with between 500k-900k depending how good their accountant is. This rocks for the amount of man hours put in, but it isn't enough to never ever have to work again.<p>I think it's hard to call the vast majority of talent acquisitions a success (for investors, not founders), because it's too difficult to tell either way what would have happened. Look what happened with Skype then look what happened with Weblogs.",1225947228

But if you asked me in 1987 about email, I would have answered different.  I think this is the whole point of the article.  It is difficult to explain the future.  Even the original inventors can't do it.  Anyway, I think it was a nice article and worthy of some thought.  Sometimes it is nice to know that maybe the right approach is just ""do"" and let the future do the explaining.",1225947181

I was up and running in about an hour and a half - everything was familiar, I knew where to go to find API calls, and I wasn't all that much slower than when I was doing PHP daily.  And I hadn't written anything in PHP for about 3 years before then, and had been actively trying to forget the language.",1225946152

Is that the point you took away or did you skip reading the rest of the article?<p>The context of that quote is not about single core versus multi core. It is about the <i>intent</i> of your code. It is a quick rule of thumb. For example, keeping the UI responsive is a goal you have regardless of the cores of the machine. To deliver on that goal you can use threads (multithreading) but that would not be equal to parallelism.<p>The larger point here is the difference between the term multithreading and parallelism. Post back on my blog post if you have any questions or suggestions on making that clearer.",1225946033

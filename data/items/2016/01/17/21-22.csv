BIP 101 originally started with a 20mb limit+growth. That was based on some calculations Gavin did. At that point the Chinese miners started saying they couldn&#x27;t accept 20 because of the firewall, but eight would be OK. They put announcements of their support for eight megabyte blocks in their coinbases, etc.<p>Why eight? Because it&#x27;s a Chinese homonym for &quot;prosper&quot; or &quot;wealth&quot;:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Chinese_culture#Eight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Chinese_culture#Eig...</a><p>It crops up in the Chinese Bitcoin community all the time. So this choice obviously wasn&#x27;t based on any kind of scientific analysis. Having Bitcoin protocol constants be decided by rhymes would obviously have been an embarrassment, but nonetheless, we compromised and did it.<p>After Core rejected the now-modified BIP 101, Gavin and I released XT together. At this point the miners changed their tune. They announced they would never run anything except Core, period, end of story. This &quot;requirement&quot; had not been specified before. From both speaking to them personally (I have had various phone calls with miners around the world, including miners in China) and their public statments, they made it clear that their loyalty to Core was absolute and no matter what changes we made to XT, they would never run it. Thus compromising further was pointless.<p>Why is Classic different? It wasn&#x27;t, just one or two days ago. After I released my article, I was CCd on a private thread where KnC Miner published an &quot;open letter&quot; and suggested switching to Classic. The other miners shot him down immediately saying they wanted the change to come from Core. Then the price started sliding, and they started reversing their positions.

And by this I mean you could validate no more than one block per 10 minutes, hence realistically you actually couldn&#x27;t run a full node on a desktop at 32MB.

Any hard-forking change is one for a new network and a new chain, by the very definition of hard-fork. The original Bitcoin blockchain and network will still exist, no matter how many times some of its users employ a hard-fork. A hard-fork cannot &quot;turn off&quot; Bitcoin for everyone else. This is no different than the way that an altcoin, like Litecoin, cannot &quot;turn off&quot; Bitcoin merely by the deployment and launch of Litecoin.<p>Since their proposal is a backwards-incompatible change (hard-fork), it should be obvious that it does not increase the capacity of the current system, but rather a new system. I find myself wondering how anyone can think it is increasing the capacity of the <i>previous</i> network, given the definition of an (intentional!) hard-fork?<p>Maybe if we all just wish hard enough, IPv4 will spontaneously transform into IPv6..... Bitcoin will continue to function even in the presence of yet-another hard-fork.<p>Anyone is welcome to do as they please, including whatever hard-forks they might want to participate in, just as anyone is welcome to use Bitcoin or how they are welcome to abandon Bitcoin if they find that they don&#x27;t like its offering. However, anyone who wants to participate in a hard-fork should do so in a safe and responsible way, such as by using a new name for the new system, using a new address identifier to avoid cross-chain contamination accidents, etc.<p>What is Bitcoin Core&#x27;s role in all of this? <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/2016-01-07-statement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/2016-01-07-statement</a><p>Soft-forks and hard-forks? <a href=""https://petertodd.org/2016/soft-forks-are-safer-than-hard-forks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://petertodd.org/2016/soft-forks-are-safer-than-hard-fo...</a><p>bip99 has some more details: <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0099.mediawiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0099.mediawi...</a><p>Bitcoin Core published a capacity increases roadmap: <a href=""http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-December/011865.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-...</a><p>... and a FAQ about their capacity increases roadmap: <a href=""https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq...</a><p>> and [theymos] has strongly censored and perverted all discussion of changes<p>That&#x27;s not really true, just search &quot;site:reddit.com/r/bitcoin&quot; for XT or classic or whatever.

I do not understand why journalists repeat this claim. It is like saying &quot;investing in the stock market is so expensive that it takes company-sized investments to participate&quot;. It is not true. Whether you invest $1000 or $1 million your returns—as a percentage of your initial investment—will be the same regardless if this is the stock market or Bitcoin mining.<p>In fact I would say the opposite is true: small miners have a slightly better profitability than large-scale miners, because they are so small they do not even have to cover certain costs. A large-scale miner will have to pay for hosting or for building a data center but a small miner will host the hardware in his house at no extra cost. A large-scale miner will have to hire staff to maintain the miners but a small miner will maintain his machine himself.<p>Of course profitability depends a lot on electricity costs, but again you might be a small miner and live (for example) in Douglas County, Washington and pay a domestic electricity rate of 2.5 cents per kWh, and you will beat many large-scale miners who almost always pay more (see my previous comment on this: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10907584"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10907584</a>).<p>Large-scale miners may get a financial advantage by buying hardware in bulk, or manufacturing it themselves, but this is a cost saving of at most 20 or 30%, and this certainly does <i>not</i> make mining so expensive that small miners cannot participate.",1453065930

They don&#x27;t really know how to apply these concepts to solve real-life problems yet, and often by the time they encounter such problems they might have forgotten what they were taught anyway. How much knowledge do you really retain as a teenager in college trying to pass a test?<p>2. The person who learns these concepts because they need them to solve a real-life programming problem at their job. I would wager this person learns these concepts more thoroughly because they need to actually understand them in order to finish their work.

Containers do not compose.  There are many runtime environments to consider, and Docker can&#x27;t handle anything but containers.  You need to use some other software to manage the host system at the very least.  Furthermore, the container images have no useful provenance for users to inspect.  It&#x27;s a security nightmare.<p>Functional package management is the real solution here.  Software like GNU Guix and Nix solve real problems.  They remove global state (/usr), enable reproducible builds, allow unprivileged package management, support transactional upgrades and roll backs, deduplicate software system-wide for all users, handle full-system configuration in a declarative way, eliminate the need to trust any particular provider of binaries, and more.<p>>Does anyone not remember what it was like to fight shared library versioning conflicts?<p>Using Docker to solve this problem is like using a sledgehammer to drive a nail.",1453064879

7203849,comment,7203707,7203707,2,0,coralreef,,,"I graduated with a degree in Business and looked for startup jobs a few years back. It is difficult because:<p>1) Startups generally don&#x27;t hire &quot;business&quot; people. You&#x27;d have to have a very specific role like marketing or customer service or community management.<p>2) Following #1, startups won&#x27;t hire you unless you have experience in those fields (or hard skills). Startups don&#x27;t have the resources to train you, and will never let a complete noobie have reign over any of their program.<p>Unfortunately your skill set as you described it above falls short, because pretty much everyone says they have passion, and you lack hard skills.<p>My suggestion: starting gaining experience through your own small projects. Identify which field of work you specifically want to work in. Build a product or service, ship it, try to get it blog coverage or press, run a Facebook/Adword campaign and optimize it. Build a mailing list. Build a FB fan page following. You need to build a body of evidence you can show startups come hiring time. &quot;These are the things I&#x27;ve done, and this is what I can do for you.&quot;<p>People (bloggers) always write about how startups should hire generalists, but in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t happen because startups are far more attracted to specialists whom they can shoehorn into generalist roles. Its less risky for them because that specialist has demonstrated depth of skill and competence, vs a generalist who shows less depth, but broader range.<p>Best of luck",1391910665

7203833,comment,7203364,7203623,73,0,mjn,,,"I know less about the new Linux ones, but a brief summary of the two big &quot;traditional&quot; ones:<p>Linux systems traditionally use &quot;SysV Init&quot;, the init system from AT&T UNIX System V (1983). It&#x27;s the one that has: 1) run levels; and 2) a pile of shell scripts in /etc/init.d that run on run-level changes. Run levels probably make most sense if you think of Ye Olde Mainframe booting: first it initializes core services, then it enters multi-user mode, then it initializes network services, then (optionally) it enters full application mode. These are supposed to be discrete, semantically meaningful boot levels that you could purposely initiate: boot to runlevel 1, boot to runlevel 2, drop back to runlevel 1. Dependencies are handled by a mixture of those runlevels, and scripts that are run in alphabetical order <i>within</i> run levels. That ordering (unlike runlevels) is not supposed to be meaningful to the sysop, but just necessity-based: some stuff depends on other services already being started, even if conceptually you want them all &quot;at once&quot;. The convention is to prefix startup-script filenames with numbers that effectively serve as priorities within a runlevel.<p>BSD systems traditionally use their own &quot;BSD init&quot;. There are no runlevels, though there is still a separate &quot;single-user mode&quot; for maintenance. In classic BSD startup was just one very large shell script in /etc/rc. In later versions it was augmented by an /etc/rc.local script that allowed local modifications to be made without mucking with the main script. Modern BSDs (starting with NetBSD, later adopted by the others) modularized it, with an /etc/rc.d directory (base system) and /usr/local/etc/rc.d/ directory (ports). This differs from SysV init in that it still has no run levels, and rather than explicit ordering via filename sorting, has dependency-resolution ordering via semantic comments at the top of each script that are parsed and resolved by rcorder(8) (<a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rcorder&sektion=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rcorder&sektion=8</a>). Afaik this system, originating in NetBSD, was the first dependency-based startup system on a free Unix (I believe commercial Unixes like Solaris also moved to dependency-based init in the 2000s).<p>Many Linux vendors have decided that SysV Init is not such a nice system nowadays, because it involves maintaining fairly complex scripts with edge cases that have to be handled in every script through error-prone boilerplate, and an explicit global startup ordering: all programs that can be installed on Debian and need startup must be assigned an integer that fully specifies their position in the startup sequence relative to all other programs that might also be installed. Runlevels as a mechanism also seem pretty unhelpful for most uses people have nowadays. Instead there is a hope for some kind of dependency-based startup. But the big disagreement is over what to replace it with. It is also complicated by other changes that are happening in parallel and which are caught up in it. For example, Linux&#x27;s &#x27;cgroups&#x27; resource-control mechanism has long been in the kernel, but not widely used by userspace tools, and there are moves to sort out this situation by essentially letting the init system also own resource assignments, which would more tightly couple those components. This is probably where the big philosophical differences come in.",1391910389

A service is written by declaring which services need to be started for that service to start. It is also a syslog like program (journal) and a cgroups writer (cgroups are a cointainment feature of the linux kernel). It also features socket activated and bus activated services, where the init system watches for a socket or dbus bus to be accessed, and then starts the job then. It is criticized for being too invasive and too tied to linux kernel features (like cgroups).<p>Upstart: an event based init system. Jobs start and stop on a certain event (or events). These events can be socket events, dbus events, udev events (network-device-added, removed, changed, etc.) or job events ($JOB-started, stopped, starting, stopping). There are also other events, but those are the basics. It suffers in two areas: socket activation is limited to one tcp or unix socket (no UDP, no tcp6, no DGRAM), and it unreliably stops services. The former is a simple problem that would not be too much work to fix (the developers of Upstart did not want to use socket activation, so they decided to stop efforts on developing it), and the latter is a fundamental code problem. Upstart uses ptrace to track daemons, while systemd uses pidfiles and cgroups. Because Upstart does not use cgroups, it can not kill all of a services children (just that service), and so zombie services might be problematic.",1391909978

7203796,comment,7200280,7200829,1,0,waps,,,"I note you failed to actually illustrate species with stable numbers. What the logistic function has to do with anything, I don&#x27;t know. When reading through the reason they choose this function to model population growth it is exactly to construct a stable population growth, not because this was observed in practice.<p>And most certainly the human population curve looks nothing like the logistic function. It was going up much faster than the logistic function predicts. And the current slowdown of human population growth is so much faster than the ramp-up it&#x27;s ridiculous to compare them. In the logistic function the slowdown mirrors the ramp-up. That&#x27;s obviously not happening to humans.<p>I can give plenty of popular examples of wildly fluctuating population numbers. Cats versus kangaroos/wallabies versus rabbits versus birds in Australia. Buffalo&#x27;s versus beavers versus cats versus ... in Yellowstone park. Those are well studied examples of major flips in population density. I also grew up in an area with lots of farms, and I know that for example the number of wolves living in nature follows this pattern. Some years it is so bad they actually attempt to eat adult humans (and sometimes succeed), sometimes there are none. We had a rabbit problem while I was at university, and the biology department investigated. There was an exchange between the number of cats (ex-housecats) and the number of rabbits. First the cats would eat nearly all the rabbits, then they&#x27;d starve to the point that few cats remained (and human interference like milk bowls does indeed make things worse), after that the rabbit population multiplied in two years by a factor of more than 1000, after which the cat numbers started growing again.<p>In all these cases you will observe massive swings in the population numbers. The swings were so large that just the swings themselves were at risk of making the species die off entirely (if a swing hits the number 1 or 0, the species never recovers, and has to be reintroduced. In practice that number is 9-10 according to the biology department. For rabbits or cats it never takes long for the species to be reintroduced of course). The biology department paper also claimed that while the timeframes vary wildly from species to species, these swings are the status-quo (within one habitat, the global population is more stable), not the exception.<p>I do know this more from an algorithmic point of view, and I learn biology only as I need it, or if I&#x27;m bored or stuck. Which is why I asked you for a few examples of these stable population numbers, as I wouldn&#x27;t really know. In genetic algorithms stable population numbers don&#x27;t occur.<p>Normally, because from time t -> t+1 you either let every current try duplicate n -> k<i>n (higher k is better, but requires more resources), which is of course exponential growth. Then you kill all the ones that underperform (which is always basically all of them), or you select the k best performers. Or you can try to be smarter and model sexual reproduction, at which point you grow like n -> k </i> n * (n - 1), which is even faster.<p>There are plenty of variations, but almost all the ones I&#x27;ve ever seen work have exponential growth + 90%+ die offs. Even then genetic algorithms are disappointingly slow in most cases. On the plus side, genetic algorithms will find answers no other algorithm is able to find (much better coverage of the search space). However this comes at a truly massive cost in resources (as you would expect, but it&#x27;d be nice if it didn&#x27;t).<p>So you have an exponential growth, followed by a 99% dieoff (the number that die off has to increase the greater the population size becomes due to memory/cpu constraints).",1391909833

Almost all the material stays at the site. While the smallest possible bomb is about 20kg of fissile material, actual bombs are an order of magnitude bigger. In addition, bombs cause neutron activation in the environment and create a mushroom cloud that lifts fallout into the stratosphere. The immediate effects are much worse and much more widespread.<p>You can say scary things like, &quot;tripled the radioactive cesium in the Pacific&quot;, but Fukushima leaked around 9kg of cesium radioisotopes. Outside of the immediate area, there&#x27;s no risk to marine or human life. From <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341070/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341070/</a>:<p><i>We address risks to public health and marine biota by showing that though Cs isotopes are elevated 10–1,000× over prior levels in waters off Japan, radiation risks due to these radionuclides are below those generally considered harmful to marine animals and human consumers, and even below those from naturally occurring radionuclides.</i><p>Instead of spreading FUD, look at the statistics. Again, from <a href=""http://squid314.livejournal.com/292620.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://squid314.livejournal.com/292620.html</a>:<p><i>A useful measure of power plant capacity is the &quot;terawatt&quot;, equal to one trillion watts. Coal kills 2500 times as many people per terawatt as nuclear. In fact, nuclear power has the lowest fatality per terawatt of any form of power in existence. Rooftop solar power has a per terawatt death rate ten times worse than nuclear power because of - I kid you not - people falling off roofs when installing the panel. Hydroelectric power has a worse fatality rate because of dams bursting and flooding people. Even wind power has a worse fatality per terawatt rate - seventy three people have died in windmill related accidents.</i><p>You responded with the economics of solar power instead of addressing my points about safety, but as far as I can tell, you&#x27;re incorrect on that. By every measure I could find, solar was over twice the cost of nuclear. It would break the chart if it was shown on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cost_of_energy_sources"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Cost_of_energy_sources</a>. While nuclear power has decreased recently, the reason is political ass-covering, not economics. And it&#x27;s not solar that&#x27;s picking up the slack. Fossil fuels are the winners: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_energy_consumption.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_energy_consumption.s...</a><p>There are two reasons for this: 1. Fossil fuels are cheap, mostly because their cost to the environment and public health aren&#x27;t priced in. 2. They are reliable base-band sources of power. Coal works no matter how cloudy it gets or how calm the wind is. Without reliable, predictable generation, wind and solar require expensive (and sometimes dangerous) energy storage systems. At best, they can only supplement base-band sources.",1391909752

I would also argue that code comments are not always the best place for this historical information (if you don’t know about the deep past of a bit of code, then why would you want to see a code comment describing some change to it?).<p>I suggest we take a step back and ask if modern version control is the best way to store historical information. Modern version control systems (git, mercurial, etc.) were built within the last decade or so but they were built with the same constraints as the original version control systems of the 1980’s. They are optimized to be disk efficient (and don’t get me started about their command line interfaces). This is crazy!<p>We should store much more about the programming process than the data gathered if and when a developer chooses to commit. We should record it all- every keystroke. No human generated source of data is ever going to fill up our hard drives or the cloud. Don’t optimize for the disk!<p>This data can be used to replay programming sessions so that others can learn exactly how the code evolved.

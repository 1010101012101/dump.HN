7435187,comment,7431369,7431710,2,0,Sniperfish,,,"Bloomberg support is excellent but I disagree it is as significant in decision making as some commentators appear to imply. Many shops will have internal support able to handle the majority of first line questions, then Bloomberg support is relied on more for edge cases or tier 2 support. Especially at the senior (decision makers) level they may have someone contact Bloomberg on their behalf; so the degree to which support is better is not punishing competition.<p>Tangential to 5) there are numerous financial services firms of various scales, and even the mid-sized and small shops (for whom $20k/yr + exchange fees is not a write-off amount) disproportionately use Bloomberg. I think squigs25 identifies some of these reasons, I would highlight and add the following:<p>1) Network effect - Even if you build a better mousetrap capital markets are highly connected. On the sell side we may adapt our technology choices to our most significant clients on the buy-side to provide as seamless a service as possible to clients. Bloomberg messenger has been mentioned by many people and that is a huge factor in our decision making, but simpler things contribute too:<p>1.a) Consistency - If my client calls we&#x27;re discussing a trade or security it is a significant advantage in seeing the same thing they see. Be it VWAP on the day to 6dp, the order we&#x27;re looking at published research, recent trades, if we&#x27;re looking at the same thing the service I can provide is improved. My service and execution is how I differentiate myself. This relies on us using the same system<p>1.b) Connectivity - I can have a Bloomberg EMSX client able to send trades to me in ~5 minutes with no exaggeration. Similarly if they want to receive our IOIs or TA (basically advertising from the sell-side to the buy-side) and have an acronym - the connection between the systems already exists and I can find and target your specific acronym in under 5 minutes.<p>B) Incentives - Smaller shops are, in my experience, less likely to mandate technology to sales/trading/research. It is also unlikely that my personal technology expenses are tied to my comp. Even if cost is significant to the firm it may not be to the individual who have influence<p>C) Inertia - Capital Markets are not Technology firms. Technology exists to facilitate a job and if it does that well enough there is scant appetite for change. No one wants to re-learn tools that have been familiar for years. They want to even less when that is fundamentally not seen as part of the job, it&#x27;s a facilitator and should be easy and convenient as a result.<p>Reliability cannot be emphasized enough. The uptime % we expect (and Bloomberg delivers) is exceptionally high during and around market hours.<p>(source: work on sell-side trading desks)",1395320041

You have to bring up all of the services downstream in order to test functionality which crosses that boundary.  You also have to worry a lot more about different versions of services talking to each other and how to test/manage that.  The flip side is that the services will be much smaller, so leaf nodes in the call graph can reach a level of test coverage higher than a monolithic service.<p>Debugging and performance testing becomes more complicated because when something is wrong you now have to look at multiple services (upstream and downstream) in order to figure out where the cause of some bug or performance issue is.  You also run into the versioning issue from above where you have a new class of bug caused by mismatched versions which either have tweaked interfaces or underlying assumptions that have changed in one but not the other (because the other hasn&#x27;t been deployed and those assumptions are in shared code).  The bright side for debugging and performance is that once you know which service <i>is</i> causing the issue it&#x27;s way easier to find what inside the service is causing the issue.

Some packagings even create an initial database for you; for those which don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just:<p><pre><code>  sudo -i postgres\n  initdb\n  createuser wildutah\n  createdb -O wildutah wildutah\n</code></pre>\nI think the PostgreSQL manual is very good. The one weakness that i can see is that there isn&#x27;t (that i know of) a single-page soup-to-nuts getting started guide for someone simply using PostgreSQL locally.

7435043,comment,7434448,7434851,11,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Cars are too dangerous to not be tracked.</i><p>I used to think a lot of things were justified, because on balance they would help to protect innocent people against relatively minor illegal activities, and while they could theoretically be used for major abuses by governments no democratically elected administration would ever get away with doing it. Many of those had to do with balancing everyone being accountable under the law with anonymity and privacy.<p>Unlike some people, I prefer to learn the lessons of history and change my views when the evidence warrants, and I am increasingly of the view that the democratic accountability of our governments is far too weak and the price of trusting governments with the power afforded by a surveillance state is far too high to pay for some modest benefits.<p>A case in point: &#x27;omh mentioned the London Congestion Charge in another post to this discussion, linking to news that (contrary to clear assurances given when the cameras were rolled out) the London mayor now wants to give police direct access to the cameras. Now, to be fair, this isn&#x27;t an absurd idea: no doubt these cameras do help to catch some people who are trying to escape justice after breaking the law (they are careful to cite examples of this) and reportedly this was in the Mayor&#x27;s manifesto at the last election so it does have some degree of democratic mandate.<p>Of course, there have also been stories where the system has gone horribly wrong and incorrectly fined people[1], or just not been understood and penalised people who were trying to behave reasonably and do the right thing[2]. Given that the way our court system works means that it can be prohibitively expensive to challenge automated penalty notices issued by such systems if you live a long way away and were just visiting (assuming you really were ever there in the first place) I have significant reservations about how easy this kind of &quot;enforcement&quot; becomes under a surveillance state, and whether even the genuine benefits of better enforcement against minor offenders are enough to justify such schemes, which makes me even less trusting of the long-term motivations of those involved.<p>[1] I can&#x27;t immediately find a link, but the one I most remember was an elderly gentlemen who lived in the north of England and rarely if ever visited London any more, yet who wound up getting many fines sent to him, presumably because someone cloned his plates.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/23/congestion-charge-wrong-way"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jan/23/congesti...</a>",1395318146

Bundler could even easily create an aggregate manifest of all the gems the app depends on to make the check very cheap.<p>I keep meaning to try to hack something together, but for now I have something half-assed that cuts enough seconds of my app start times that I haven&#x27;t been able to prioritise it.",1395317342

If you can define a very clean interface without having to do a lot of contortions to get the data you want where you need it, then extracting a service can be relatively low overhead.  But what often happens is at the 30,000-foot view it looks like a service makes sense, but then when you get into the details you realize the separation can not be as clean as you first envisioned.",1395317314

Those are horrible words for it, but I mean in that one manager would be actively overseeing the work, and the other would be a lower level of involvement check/balance against the former.

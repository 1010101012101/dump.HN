As I walk into work everyday, I always think, why can't I be happy like every other guy walking into work.<p>All I want to do in the crowded elevator at work is to bleat out, like sheep, ""Baaa baaa baaa"". I always think how funny that would be. :)<p>Infact I would say I've lost a good chunk of income - (40,000 a year?) just paying for my ""individuality"". I've done this by telling bosses what I thought about their ideas and that (and yes I've used these words in verbatim) ""I can only do things that _I_ feel are right. You can give me advice, but I might not follow it."". So I've lost out on a few promotions and money.<p>I've received scorn, been laughed at and sometimes even received ""pity"" from some of my friends who do whatever their bosses tell them to do and are getting compensated well for it.<p>And the whole reason I've done this is because I've always felt that:<p>1. The only thing that will help me to be independent in the future as an entrepreneur is to be independent right now.<p>2. If I lose this ability to be myself, I lose everything - ie the ability to ever hope to start my own thing.<p>Now I might be completely wrong about this and I might have gone to extremes at time, but this concept of ""being a misfit"" is something I've cherished. Hopefully in the near future, when I have my own venture again, we'll see if I was right and whether this is as valuable as I've always thought :).<p>At the very least, I can say that its never been boring :).<p>(Background: The reason I've not been able to start my own thing fulltime has been because of a green card.

1537752,comment,1536946,1536946,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Some comments on your proposed additions (my other comments were about the proposed reductions):<p>- I don't think .NET-style generics can be implemented in a statically typed language that doesn't have a common base class (e.g. everything derives from class Object).  This is an oversimplification to say this but at some level generics are implemented as syntatic sugar for typecasts between Object and the type parameter type.  If you want generics instead of templates, a lot of C#'s design gets pulled in along for the ride.  Nothing wrong with that (C# is a fine language), just as long as you understand it will happen and why.  But also be aware that it means you will never be able to make a generic array class that performs as fast as a C++ STL vector does - which violates your own starting criteria, that it has to be as fast as C++ to succeed.<p>- Most of the time I wish pass-by-reference were implicit, but pass by value has some special consequences in C++ that make it unlike many other languages.  I was able to write a class that does fast bit-twiddling on itself, with its internal representation being an integer, and the entire thing was no more expensive in memory or speed than C functions bit twiddling on an int.  So I was able to get abstraction and raw speed with no compromises.  That's a rare use case, but I think it is illustrative of why pass by value is in C++ - you don't need it most of the time, but when you need it, you really need it.<p>As for not being able to reseat a reference, I found that frustating too until I started learning LLVM and about SSA (static single assignment).  The common answer to why you can't reseat a C++ reference is just that it has something to do with compiler optimizations.  That common answer is too weak; it has EVERYTHING to do with how the compiler optimizes the code.  Basically, if you're asking why can't I reseat a reference, you don't understand what a reference is.  But it's not your fault:  what you really don't understand is that C++ uses the <i>word</i> reference to refer to a thing that is not exactly like references as used in other languages.  I used to think a reference was syntactic sugar for a pointer; that's not quite true.  A C++ reference literally IS the object; it's just converted to a pointer during the process of a function call.  The reason you can't reseat the reference is that if you could the static analysis of the program becomes immeasurably harder and later in the code the compiler cannot be absolutely sure that it knows what the reference really refers too.<p>In a way, not being able to reseat a C++ reference is a lot like not being able to assign to a constant defined by a macro or not being able to assign a new address to a function at runtime.  It's part of a class of things that happen at a stage before runtime, and to change the system so that it would be possible would require introducing a level of indirection.",1279791262

1537726,comment,1537461,1537461,0,0,ibagrak,,,"If that's any consolation, you are not alone. I've been spending a lot of time lately thinking about strategies for advancing past mediocrity. Here are some general principles that I apply regardless of your background and past accomplishments:<p>1) Learn by doing and trying, not by thinking. Aimless reflection and introspection are bottomless pits that can suck up enormous amount of time that could be put to far more productive uses.  If you have a choice between reading a book on a programming language and going through a tutorial that forces you to try examples, go through the tutorial. Immediate, tactile learning is better than abstract success stories which paper over important ingredients for success.<p>2) Social networking is key. Grow by connecting yourself to communities of peers, mentors, gurus, etc that you can actually rely on and that you can benefit from. If HN is making you depressed, stop reading it. Instead establish meaningful professional and personal connections with people that are supportive. The value of your circle is often overlooked. I am a firm believer that the quality of the people you know is the great predictor of your overall happiness and achievement.<p>3) Focus on the things you need to know. The number of programming languages you know doesn't matter. It is a meaningless metric. What matters is how comfortable you are with the tools that help you get _your_ job done. This is related to point 1). Having mastery and proficiency of something that you use daily is far more important than having the breadth of knowledge and mastery of exotic languages.<p>4) Stack your skills. Time is short so the best way to advance is to leverage maximum of what you _already_ know. In other words, don't jump around and shift gears all the time.  Think of a long term goal(s) and try to segment the path toward that goal such that you can (a) complete each segment without getting distracted, (b) get feedback after each segment (c) learn something in each segment that you can use in the next. It doesn't have to be one project. In fact it's better if a sequence of projects, so you can adjust your course along the way.<p>5) Don't stop. Giving up is an attractive option. Our society has many different ways to cushion your fall, which can make quitting tempting and virtually painless. If you want to achieve something, idleness is definitely _not ok_.<p>Update: edited for style and grammar.",1279789754

However neither Kubica or Nico have been given a truely championship winning car yet to prove themselves.",1279789511

It had rained and there were puddles of water on the road sides. At one place a beautiful young woman was standing unable to walk across because of a puddle of water. The elder of the two monks went up to a her lifted her in his alms and left her on the other side of the road, and continued his way to the monastery.
In the evening the younger monk came to the elder monk and said, ""Sir, as monks, we cannot touch a woman ?""
The elder monk answered ""yes, brother"".
Then the younger monk asks again, "" but then Sir, how is that you lifted that woman on the roadside ?""
The elder monk smiled at him and told him "" I left her on the other side of the road, but you are still carrying her """,1279789511

I recall being a kid and just starting to read, and reading a book of jokes, and wondering how in the world someone could possibly be clever enough to make all of those great jokes. Every other situation has basically been a repeat of that. So while I often get the feeling of ""that idea is so simple, why didn't I think of it"" or ""I could have done something like that,"" more and more I recognize that it's just a matter of right place/right time to get the idea, to be motivated to take it seriously, and to execute on it.<p>Learning is easier than product creation, IMHO. A product involves an ongoing dialogue with a customer of some kind(even if it's free), while a skill is just something you have and can demonstrate every so often, so you can go at your own pace and not worry so much about ""the guy at the other end.""<p>The only thing bad about learning is when you hit a peak so high that you run out of other people at or above your level to talk with. It's an incredibly lonely feeling.",1279789444

2913630,comment,2913126,2913337,18,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I don't think the primary appeal of static sites is their performance. It's about complexity and maintenance.<p>At a minimum, a LAMP stack requires prompt security patches at all levels of the stack and a working system for automated SQL backups (and, of course, testing your SQL backups to make sure they restore). If you haven't configured your system perfectly (e.g. you forgot to rotate one of your logfiles properly) you'll need to perform more maintenance than that; Murphy's Law implies that you'll be doing that at three in the morning local time. Hopefully you installed an uptime monitor.<p>If your CMS contains bugs -- and it does -- that's a slew of additional security patches which you'll have to apply, and occasional broken functionality that you'll have to track down and fix.<p>Every few years (at most) a new version of Linux will come out. Every few years (at most) a new version of your CMS will come out. The old versions will stop getting fixes, so you'll have to upgrade.<p>Despite these efforts, there is still a good chance that your CMS will get hacked: LAMP stacks are complex beasts, even out of the box with no customizations. When you do get hacked, what will you do? Turn off the code with the vuln in it? How do you know which bit of code that was?<p>In theory your $10 per month is buying a hosting provider that will take care of all of the above for you, by leveraging the awesome economy of scale. And, indeed, maybe the correct answer is to use a blog-hosting service. Many people seem to be happy with Tumblr.<p>But for those of a more control-freaky nature, the dream of the static site is that you'll reduce or eliminate these pains by making all the moving parts as stupid as possible. (You can't perform SQL injection on a site which has no forms or, for that matter, SQL.) In addition to being stupid, static sites are also as generic as possible: You can switch from S3 to another host in minutes, sign up for a CDN in minutes, switch from Apache to nginx to IIS in minutes. Meanwhile you have at least one up-to-date offsite backup at all times by default -- the data for your entire site lives on the box you publish from. Plus you have a perfectly functioning, extremely intuitive dev/staging setup -- you can tinker with a static site offline on your local machine, get your new hacks working, then push live with an rsync and be reasonably assured that the static pages will work the same in production as they do locally.",1314039573

And using the same teacher in both conditions doesn't solve problems - the teacher expects students in the experimental group to do better, and will influence the result even if not actively trying to.<p>But unfortunately A) this is the kind of studies the  department of education wants and funds (randomized experimental designs - see the 'what works' database, where they ignore anything not using that design).  And this is the case even when the control group is obviously in an intentionally deprived learning environment.  And B) the opposite design, tightly equalizing every aspect of the control and experimental groups, isn't good either, because it wouldn't take advantage of the new things blended learning / software afford (like animations, interactive feedback) that traditional paper-based instruction doesn't.

Measure what they learned, their engagement, etc.  THEN you try to figure out things that didn't work out so well, things you missed...try to apply a theory or framework to explain what happened.  THEN try it out a second time making revisions, and see if you can increase the learning gains and engagement even more the next time.  Use of pre-test / baseline measures makes it possible to do comparisons.<p>2) Do short studies comparing different designs of the Khan Academy software and curriculum.  This is traditional, individual lab-based studies.

By stealing a Porsche (whatever be your motivation) you are denying another person the right to his car. However, the same is untrue of pirating.<p>I am firmly of the belief that until we abandon the false and forced analogies and treat digital data and IP as something new, something that requires us to work out ethics and moral of afresh, we'll be stuck in this rut of old business models forcing new technology to fit into their mold and the consumers suffering because of bureaucracy.<p>I'll go further and state that the precise reason why Movie Studios and Recording Labels seemingly don't want to innovate and adopt new technologies to their benefit is precisely because of this thinking that immediately clouds all other possible arguments (oh, and maybe the people in charge of making decisions have got to the top because of their understanding of old technologies and therefore have little incentive to abandon that and embrace newer ways of doing business) /rant",1314039113

Also, the ""Unbranded Player"" line of the comparison is checked for Vidyard even though the pricing page says the Free plan uses a branded player.<p>Maybe just get rid of that pricing line in the comparison?",1314038862

Don't underestimate interacting with the customer and seeing how they use the product. Instead of asking, do you like this, find out why and how they come to their decision.<p>When I do web products, the UX, I'll create a wireframe/mockup then find people and ask the question, ""How would you do X"". Then see how they think through the interface. After a couple iterations I'll create a quick web app to test varying hypotheses.<p>Another tip, I do this when forming a pricing strategy, is to form a few cases (X price with Y features). Then see which the person picks or test one at a time and see which gets the most responses. You can do DOE or multivariate analysis and come up with a near optimal solution.",1314038413

So if a user moves to new hardware (with a different UDID), and they restore from a backup of their previous device, the token stays the same. Similarly, if a user does a complete restore of an iOS device (same UDID), but sets the existing device up as a new device, a new token is assigned.<p>I have about a year of data from providing push to ~100K active device tokens. The former scenario, where a user upgrades to a new device and restores from a backup of their old device is really common. The latter almost never happens. So the UDID is marginally useful, in that it allows you to abstract push-enabled iOS systems from iOS devices.<p>For doing something like user authentication, the APNs token is actually preferable, because it gets transported along with app data when a user upgrades to a new device. I'm guessing that developers use the UDID, because when you register with the system to get the APNs token, the user is prompted to accept or deny push notifications.<p>Edit: And, yes, tokens aren't specific to an app; there's one per system that all the apps share.",1314038370

2913523,comment,2912218,2912943,3,0,jrockway,,,"It depends; if all you want to do is lift normal functions to the domain of unsafe operation (where an unsafe input implies unsafe output), then sure:<p><pre><code>    newtype Unsafe a = Unsafe a\n    \n    instance Functor Unsafe where\n        fmap f (Unsafe k) = Unsafe . f $ k\n\n    addTwo :: Int -> Int\n    addTwo = (+2)\n\n    unsafeAddTwo :: Unsafe Int -> Unsafe Int\n    unsafeAddTwo = fmap addTwo\n</code></pre>\nBut really, I'm not sure this is the right approach.  Even values generated inside my program need to be quoted for inclusion on an HTML page.  What you want to avoid is double-quoting, so what you need is simpler:<p><pre><code>    data Content = Quoted String | Unquoted String\n\n    output :: [Content] -> Content\n    output = concatMap f\n       where f (Unquoted x) = quote x\n             f (Quoted   x) = x\n</code></pre>\nNow the type system ensures that (output . output) == output, which is what you really want to ensure.  Tainted data, I think, is a separate concern.  And the solution, in that case, doesn't involve a functor, it involves making sure your library tags everything as Unsafe and that your data validation functions remove that annotation:<p><pre><code>    type Params a = Map String (Unsafe a) -- keys may also be unsafe, YMMV\n\n    readHtmlForm :: Request -> Params String\n    validateField :: Validatable a => Unsafe a -> a\n\n    main = output .

I mean, if you happen to know that there are two disjoint sets of Good Customers and Bad Customers than that is <i>very useful information</i> to anyone who needs to know the CLV number to do their job.

It may be the case that there are behaviors which you can use as a proxy for which group someone is likely to fall in.  Dharmesh Shah talks often about a Customer Happiness Index that Hubspot uses, which is essentially a regression that predicts churn rate based on measurable customer behavior.  It's all sorts of win to find that something like that works for your business.

To burn it, the air should be slowed down in the aircraft frame of reference. That means acceleration of that air in the Earth frame of reference. It isn't a noticeable energy loss below Mach 2, yet above the Mach 2-3 it starts to impact the efficiency of the air breathing scheme to the point that rocket engine carrying oxygen with it (ie. accelerating it in the Earth frame of reference and keeping it non-moving in the aircraft frame of reference) doesn't look that less efficient, and the higher the speed the less the efficiency gap. Scramjets (no slowing down of the air) while seemingly fixing that problem face the other side of the same issue - trying to impact even small amount of additional momentum on the already fast moving air (in the aircraft frame of reference) requires an unproportionally increasing (the same v square) amount of power.<p>2. due to composition of the Earth atmosphere, to burn 1kg of oxygen, the aircraft need to pump through engine - ie. accelerate as described in the point 1. above to the speed close to its own in the Earth's frame of reference - 5 kg of air.<p>The jet propulsion itself doesn't care that mass m being thrown out of the nozzle with velocity v consists of - H, O2, H2O, steel balls or foam - doesn't make difference as long as it is of mass ""m"", and the aircraft needs to come up with that mass somehow - carry it with itself or gather from outside (and accelerate the mass or try to impact momentum on the already fast moving mass).<p>Take the points above, add the simplicity and low weight of the rocket engine in comparison with air breathing engines and you will see why rocket engines are dominating the arena.",1314037020

String literals are strictly single-quoted.<p>That way, I know that single-quoted strings, which is most of them, won't ever involve user input, while double quoted strings get a little extra scrutiny.

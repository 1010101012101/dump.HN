See bitcoin.</i><p>Bitcoin was perhaps the worst possible example you could have chosen... The implementation was the opposite of mediocre; its code predicted and solved implementation problems that no one realized were problems, except Satoshi.  And on a technical level, the client has only experienced <i>one</i> problem that had to be rolled back.  There are few other implementations of anything that have that kind of track record.<p>A better example of a mediocre implementation of something would be the original Quake engine.  Ha, got you, just kidding.  Actually, I can&#x27;t think of anything that&#x27;s made &quot;a lot of impact&quot; while also being both a mediocre implementation and very difficult on a technical level.  Even Minecraft wasn&#x27;t mediocre.  Difficulty and mediocrity seem to be opposites, the way magnetic poles are.",1391097517

I don&#x27;t think either the original SICP or Bret Victor will be the last word on this matter.<p>In Bret Victor&#x27;s terms, the scheme used in SICP has very little &quot;vocabulary&quot; to learn to read. The first section (which I linked) uses only arithmetic functions and `if` to teach you, well, how to program. And the &quot;show flow&quot; examples emphasize mutation of variables through time, while scheme uses recursion in place of loops. I think something that shows the function calls explicitly would be good, or at least something that shows the flow of function call (like the DrRacket debugger).<p>At the risk of generalizing, Bret Victor deals with things like graphics, animations and simulations, while SICP treats programming like a branch of pure math, and it&#x27;s not straightforward reconciling the two.<p>I&#x27;d love to talk more about this with you though!",1391097515

If you&#x27;re whipping together something as a test, or if it&#x27;s code that you _know_ will be thrown away in the future, then cowboy it up and get it done quickly. Good design and quality work takes more time than is needed for many first iterations so YAGNI is right.<p>The flip side is that if quality does matter for a project, then unit tests are important, and the whole point of Aaronaught&#x27;s answer is that things like unit tests and refactoring are usually impossible with a traditional singleton pattern.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a fine line though.

I found that using a DIC and passing references to services to the constructor of every class was just far too cumbersome. Is it clear which services the class uses? Absolutely. But it&#x27;s also clear if you document the services used before the class declaration. The cited advantage of DI is that it&#x27;s easier to pass service mocks during testing. This isn&#x27;t difficult to do with a service locator; as long as you instantiate your services at the beginning of the test you can have full control over mocking certain services on a test-by-test, or group-by-group level.<p>Personally, the added cruft of passing services to every constructor made me want to rip my eyes out.",1391097221

But after that hurdle, the biggest factor in success is sustained practice, humility about your skills, and a willingness to listen to advice without following it dogmatically. These skills can be developed and demonstrated in lots of non-programming backgrounds.<p>In an interview, you want to establish that the candidate knows what they&#x27;re talking about, can do basic boolean logic, functional decomposition, etc. But after that, you just talk to them about their internships, class projects, and hobbies. Find something they are clearly proud of, and ask them about it. Probe the strategic decisions and tradeoffs they made to see that they have some awareness of their process. If you find someone who can&#x27;t talk about something they&#x27;re really mastered, in any field, programming is not magically going to become the first skill they practice to mastery.<p>Ultimately, being able to identify people like this is an enormous strategic advantage. There is no boost to a team like a new junior teammate who asks questions, takes advice, works hard, and show enjoyment at tackling new hurdles.

You can see an example of the Banjo Bar in action on http://banjocrm.com, floating at the bottom of the page.<p>Addresses that are collected on your site are made available via your dashboard, where you can export your contacts as a CSV file for import into MailChimp or GMail, view details like the location of your signups and what platform they&#x27;re using, and more.

It was obviously designed for desktop, and then ported over to mobile. After a couple refreshes the app was usable, but not exactly an enjoyable experience. So &quot;Paper&quot; is how Facebook would look if it were driven by designers and mobile first (if you need any more evidence that this was very design-driven, look at the marketing video.

That makes sense for mobile, but it&#x27;s a big change. Something like that has to be intuitive, or it&#x27;s a nightmare to use.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that in Facebook&#x27;s earnings call yesterday it revealed that mobile revenue surpassed desktop revenue for the first time ever.

There is a difference between not finding evidence and saying as such, &quot;We could find no evidence that that one of our employees failed to follow correct and established procedures&quot;.

The hacker then socially engineered an employee to provide the remaining information needed to access the customer account. The customer has since regained full access to his GoDaddy account, and we are working with industry partners to help restore services from other providers. We are making necessary changes to employee training to ensure we continue to provide industry-leading security to our customers and stay ahead of evolving hacker techniques.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s likely the attacker obtained credit card info from GoDaddy rather than PayPal.",1391094004

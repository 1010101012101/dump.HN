2653739,comment,2652873,2653601,2,0,GrangalanJr,,,"Apple and Google are interesting comparisons. Some significant part of Apple's success lies in becoming identified with ""cool"": its products are stylish and fashionable in addition to being useful. Google's success, on the other hand, rests very little on that; it started out as pure utility (search), something people used not because they had lots of friends using it or because it was ""cool"" to use it, but because they tried it and it got them the results they wanted. And even if Google has become known recently as something of a ""cool"" company, I don't think that its individual products are identified as ""cool"" in the same way Apple's are.<p>So it may be worth asking: is Facebook more like Google, or more like Apple? Or in other words: would Facebook survive a demotion from ""cool, trendy place to be"" to ""utility?"" Is such a ""demotion"" happening as we speak?",1308070143

Most normal people I know would rather talk about stuff and send important links or announcements through IM, even though they also have Facebook accounts.<p>The only instance where I thought that Facebook was useful was for getting together for a 10 year high-school reunion, but even then, only half of my old colleagues were on Facebook. What worked was plain word-of-mouth, since somebody always knows someone that is missing from the conversation and can get in contact.<p>Basically what has the potential to kill Facebook are the old means of communication, channels that are still reliable and still widespread. That's why Facebook does provide IM and even email, as they want to move your Inbox on their servers; but IMHO, that remains to be seen how well it plays out, as people are pretty conservative about their current email and IM accounts (it's like your phone number, you don't want to change it so often).<p>And I can see why they are afraid of Google - Google has users that rely heavily on their email service, which is state of the art IMHO, it has user profiles that will appear in search results, it has productivity apps that allow for collaboration, it works on social search features as an alternative to Facebook's Like, and if Buzz wouldn't suck so much, they would have been a serious threat by now.<p>Unfortunately for Google, they can't seem to pull their shit together.

The reason Rails is still relevant is because the core team is committed to improvement, even at the expense of API stability and legacy support.  That's definitely a valid concern for someone supporting apps on a shoestring, but on the other hand it makes Rails more suitable for someone who wants to stay on the cutting edge.  You simply can't have it both ways...<p>> <i>We were all prototype a few years ago, now it jquery</i> ...<p>You mean __7__ years ago when they chose it as the default?  Rails was the first framework with Ajax support built-in, and it was done poorly because nobody understood how it should really work at the time.<p>> <i>we (well I) hadn't heard of coffeescript till a few months ago and now its a default option in rails</i><p>It's easy to argue that CoffeeScript shouldn't be a default, but then it's even easier to just turn it off.  Shouldn't be a point of major contention, but I can see how people don't like it.<p>> <i>The way we were constructing ActiveRecord finders had been set all through Rails 2, now we've changed it</i><p>Yes, they replaced a hodge-podge of ad-hoc query construction with a relational algebra library that enables dramatically more flexible query construction and lazy loading.  Who knows how many broken edge cases were fixed merely by the switch to a proper mathematical basis.<p>> <i>the way we dealt with gems was set all through rails 2 now its changed completely in Rails 3.</i><p>Bundler solves dozens of thorny issues that were intractable in the Rails system.  Now Rails is simpler because it doesn't have to have any gem activation code, it's handled by a separate library that can solve your gem management problems for your non-Rails projects as well.  You may not have run into any of these issues, but I assure you there were real and Bundler is a big step in the right direction.<p>> <i>the way we dealt with gems was set all through rails 2 now its changed completely in Rails 3.</i><p>Yeah but what are the implications of that?  You want Microsoft-style legacy support from Apple?  They ain't gonna give it to you, because that lack of legacy support is what enables them to move forward at the pace they do.  This has definitely impacted the type of projects I feel comfortable delivering in Rails (ie. no low-budget small client sites), but for an actively developed app it makes Rails a more attractive place to be.",1308069562

I moved over from shoulda to rspec 2 for Rails 3. All my solutions run partly on MRI/1.9.2 and have certain parts in JRuby (document parsing, search, etc). I had always been minifying and combining my Javascript. Sass with Compass/Blueprint took care of minifying and compressing my CSS. The only change that I am not comfortable with as yet is CoffeeScript. But after playing with it for a couple of hours I understand that this is an excellent choice.

Just take part in the mining pool and compare your own computing power with the percentage of the 50 BTC that you get for each block. Or, alternatively, you can track the BTC that you get from the mining pool back to the block where they were generated, and so you know that this block must have been generated by the mining pool (again, allowing you to use the amount of blocks generated by the mining pool to estimate it's overall computing power).<p>However, if the attacker does not use a public mining pool, but private infrastructure, things get more complicated: The only way how Bitcoin clients can agree on a common view of the block chain is to treat the highest block number as the authoritative one. A malicious miner can now just generate new blocks and inject them over Tor to some of the Bitcoin nodes. As Bitcoin nodes distribute the blockchain amongst each others, those ""malicious"" blocks will quickly spread throughout the Bitcoin network.<p>The only way how you could prevent this problem is some kind of whitelisting approach, where miners need to be manually approved before their blocks are accepted.

They use it for mortgages, or they put it in bond markets or equity markets. They make a profit. Some of that profit gets returned to you as interest. They also provide for safe keeping of the money. With interest rates near zero, we forget this, but thats the real reason for a bank. If it was just a safe place to keep money, we'd be paying them.<p>A Bitcoin bank couldn't work. You give them some Bitcoins. They transfer them to dollars, make some investments. Now you go to withdraw some money and they have to sell the investments. Since Bitcoins are deflationary, they can not make you whole without incurring a loss. There is no money to be made in operating a Bitcoin bank and giving interest so long as the exchange rate of Bitcoins to the real world keeps going the way its going. Everyone should just sit on their bitcoins and hold them.<p>Now if you just want to make a safe deposit box for Bitcoins, that's would work. And you would have to pay a fee. But there is a difference between a bank account and a safe deposit box, and I don't see bank accounts working with bitcoin any more so than they would have worked based on tulip bulbs in the 80s.",1308067807

It started with employers offering high-paying jobs realizing that higher education was a sign of all the qualities they wanted, so they started mandating it. Universities adjusted accordingly.<p>I'm pointing out the obvious, of course, but it's because I've seen a lot of people say things like ""we need to get over this idea."" That's not going to happen until there is a ready supply of high-paying jobs that don't require college degrees, or until someone finds a method for achieving a high-paying job that doesn't require college but is just as straightforward and successful.",1308067807

2653567,comment,2653331,2653331,21,0,Paradosso,,,"Jason:<p>I need to set aside a good hour to flesh out these ideas, but the first ideas that come into my mind:<p>- Adverse selection: most of the people in any MBA class have profiles that are at the polar opposite of entrepreneurship, valuing social approval and jumping into hoops someone else designed. A class is a very tight environment where the prevailing ethos tends to take it all. Hence even potential entrepreneurs are steered away. Remedy: change class profile --hard.<p>- Self-assurance: in top MBAs, people are continuously told they are the best of the best. The opportunity cost of entrepreneurship is then artificially inflated and the relative contribution of other profiles (developers, designers, salesmen) implicitly undervalued. Remedy: stop doing this, but then how to justify a 200k fully loaded cost?<p>- Hindsight: business school curricula are alla bout descriptions and not about predictions. All business cases are written with a massive amount of hindsight. There's the illusion of being able to explain what has happened, but no out-of-sample fit whatsoever. Explanations are sought in outside factor and not in assets such as individual talent, small teams and morale. Business school curricula the polar opposite of what Hackers & Painters is about.<p>- Skills: the curricula are slaves to student requests: they get easier and easier, grades don't matter, and hard skills that could be learnt (stats/machine learning, quant marketing, programming, sales) are not. A lot of people graduate with no significant skills whatsoever. Remedy: hormetism in business school curricula.<p>- Bubble: for many people, an MBA is a 2-year vacation that is designed to be as removed from the real world as possible (most people worked terrible jobs 100 hrs/wk and will return to do so). There's no amount of real-world work that you can do for credit during the school year.<p>- Faculty: same as studentry, it's an incredibly tight group where the dominant philosophy wins. I believe many consider MBA sections as an ensemble are demotivated jerks to be done with as soon as possible, to return to research and undergrads willing to work their asses off. Also, most tenured professors are out of touch with entrepreneurship and these are those who grant tenure to the upcoming guys. Young stars who try to do something radically different are pretty much alone and have to do superhuman efforts for a payoff that might very well be negative in terms of their career. Remedy: I have no clue.<p>Unfortunately, an MBA is a somewhat marvelous machine that pockets a lot of money (often leveraged) to provide students a socially-accepted way to spend two years out of the world while convincing themselves they are special <i>because</i> they are in the program, without any need to show special work. The real magic is tapping into a corporate system that miraculously provides six-figure jobs at the end, apparently validating the whole concept. Firms like Goldman or McKinsey follow the exact same proposition, expect substitute ""pockets a lot of money"" with ""pockets a lot of time"".<p>Disclosure: I graduated with an MBA from Wharton a month ago. I worked part-time at Etsy during my second year and am now working at Squarespace in NYC. The business school failure at teaching entrepreneurship (or, at large, how to build things) bothers me as much as you, and I'd like to fix this, as I have a hunch that an MBA class has a lot of people who could, if trained, go on to build valuable things.",1308067615

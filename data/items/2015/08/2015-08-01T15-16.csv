Slices and maps are just built-in generics. Generics would codegen <i>exactly the same way</i> as slices and maps do now. Slices and maps compile down into calls to builtin runtime functions (using intensional type analysis IIRC); a generic version of them would, if implemented properly, call down into those exact same functions.<p>> There is a generics dilemma that programmers pay today and it should be possible to turn that into a language feature with the same tradeoffs.<p>Yes, it is possible and many languages have done it. All Golang needs to do is what Swift (just to name probably the closest analogue) does, with interfaces for runtime dispatch and generics for compile-time monomorphization. Or, if you want to continue using intensional type analysis to reduce compile time, implement that as certain variants of OCaml did (though you&#x27;ll pay a performance cost to do so and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it).",1438444775

It means that your expectation that your filter is unique was incorrect.  In that scenario, a crash is what you want.  It&#x27;s like when we use asserts. Similarly ..<p>- First and FirstOrDefault are only really appropriate after an OrderBy, i.e. to get the top item of a particular ranking.  Using them anywhere else is almost always incorrect, and in the very few cases where it isn&#x27;t, needs a comment to explain why, or I&#x27;ll bounce your code back to you in review :).<p>LINQ is very expressive (you can do a lot with a little bit of code), especially with the embedded (non-fluent) syntax.  That means that, yes, you can write some non-optimal code without realizing it, because it&#x27;s only a few lines.  On the flip side, you can also refactor that code quickly into more optimal patterns.  By comparison, old-school iterating through collections is often much more difficult to refactor.",1438444480

Over time costs did grow a bit, because of the effectiveness of filtering, but at the same time if it&#x27;s unlikely for your spam to be ready, how much would you be willing to pay for it? Not that much, hopefully.<p>Targeting does not necessarily reduce the cost of ads - for very valuable users the cost of an extremely targeted ad can be quite high. The question is then what happens to the total cost of the campaign. The article seems to imply that the cost of the campaign is low for low-quality sellers, and this is why targeted ads become a bad signal for buyers. But online ads are very often performance tracked, and the entire reason that some demographics are so expensive is that the ads to them perform well. If an ad is measurably giving a high-return on investment, then the advertiser should be pouring as much as they can into the campaign, which implies that campaign budgets for some targets go up, not down, and the quality signal to buyers should be higher, now lower.<p>So it seems like as targetting differentiates by consumer, it also differentiates by seller. The ad networks also allow choosing which publications to target, and higher quality publishers do cost more. So given some self-awareness about your own value for a given target and the quality of the publication you&#x27;re reading, you could (given the signaling theory of ads is correct) get a better signal in many cases.",1438443452

Yet, it should deliver more value than a basic upgrade of old plane while having way less risk than a program requiring tons of R&D (eg F-35).<p>Now, my proposal doesn&#x27;t negate the possibility of investing in next-gen tech.

F-35, far as I can tell, benefited a bit from that program. The U-2, SR-71, B-2, and F-117 all offered unique capabilities.

It is an ordinal concept, but we don&#x27;t have the ability to measure it well, only notice large differences. You can think of it as a quantity for which we have very inaccurate measurement devices.<p>> I&#x27;m also confused as to how you can even determine that such a &quot;constant shift&quot; isn&#x27;t happening - in terms of edges in your influence graph, they shift regularly. Yesterday I met a new person at work and we now interact and influence each other. The power digraph has gained 2 edges. Could you explain how you quantify this?<p>Because in this discussion we are talking about groups (social mobility in individuals is an interesting, yet somewhat different discussion), and when we look at a large number of people, it&#x27;s easier to approximate power through proxies such as income, percentage of powerful roles such as CEOs, leading journalists etc. (it&#x27;s harder to compare power in individuals, because it&#x27;s hard to tell which is more influential, a media personality or the CEO of a large company, especially as the latter&#x27;s influence might sometimes be hidden).<p>Shifts in power from nobility to the bourgeois class, or in the relative cultural and technological power of Europe, were sudden changes of relative homeostases. Similarly, you can track power distribution between men and women, or between whites and blacks in the US. They point at very stable states that are violently changed, or (usually in the case of women), a faster rate of smaller revolutions (or a more steady rate of change). The difference between male/female and race hegemonies is also well understood (and seen in many other cultures), because the classification of women as &quot;strangers&quot; is always very different from that of actual foreign ethnicities.",1438442315

As a teacher, I have four reactions to &quot;why couldn&#x27;t I have been taught this way?&quot;:<p>1.  First and foremost, this is true.  Course structure is often not set up to reward creativity and exploration, and that is a real shame.  However …<p>2.  I have heard students complain about not being taught in a way that I know is common pedagogical practice.  That does not prove (they could just have been taught by bad teachers), but leads me to suspect, that sometimes students don&#x27;t <i>recognise</i> (or don&#x27;t want to see:  &quot;just show me the formulas!&quot;) alternate approaches when they are presented with them.<p>3.  In many cases, the &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment now <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> have been an &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment then; it is only <i>because</i> of the long struggle, and the additional learning and maturity, necessarily beginning with the confusion and uncertainty of yesterday, that everything can suddenly click today.<p>4.  Even if I knew today the exact thing that would cause that &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment for you, it is almost guaranteed that it wouldn&#x27;t cause the same reaction for (many) others.  The mission of a teacher is to serve the class as a whole; it is simply impossible, in terms of time and (let&#x27;s be frank!) the teacher&#x27;s knowledge, to explore for each student the application that will serve him or her best.  This is not to say that <i>some</i> more applications and creative exploration wouldn&#x27;t be welcome—they absolutely would—but more that, often, the best that can be done is to provide you with the <i>basic</i> tools that will allow you to explore and find the &#x27;aha!&#x27; moment on your own, probably outside of the classroom.",1438442274

My email is easy to find if you need to for some reason but I really prefer having these discussions in public.<p>>It&#x27;s, as another user said, about the military/industrial complex elephant.<p>There&#x27;s more than one elephant.

And then those who don&#x27;t mind killing people, but want it to be done efficiently. And, I think those who are indifferent to the killing of people, as long as they can get rich off of it (no, that&#x27;s not meant to be a cheap-shot at salary-people who work in defense).<p>>What would you have me do?<p>As I said previously. I think you should disclose your association with the defense/aerospace industry, and you should do that when you join a discussion.

There was a model of how milk would be a good treatment, and doctor would recommend milk to patients with ulcers.<p>Starting a few decades ago, we found that &quot;the vast majority of ulcers are caused by H pylori infection&quot; (quote from <a href=""http://www.ulcerresourcecenter.com/ulcers-and-milk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ulcerresourcecenter.com/ulcers-and-milk</a> ), and can be treated with drug therapy.<p>I point this out as an example of how even if there is a reasonable mechanistic model of how a therapy might work, which is widely believed to be true, that doesn&#x27;t mean it is true.

You are, I believe, making a statement about a homologous treatment, perhaps operant conditioning? But operant conditioning, and its application, predate NLP, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to attribute its effectiveness to NLP, nor would it be novel in NLP if Skinner discussed it in the 1950s.<p>(&quot;Operant conditioning&quot; has 18356 matches in PubMed, and the first 7 papers all use it in the cognitive psychology sense.)",1438441623

It coninues the trend of devaluing the PC and elimating any kind of premium pricing (outside of Apple).<p>I think that a lot of traditional users just want to buy something that does what they want without being nagged for further paytments.  That is why thousands of people bought MS Office for normal domestic use.  It was expensive but they bought it anyway.  Now all they get is an invitation to an app store or a monthly payment plan.  It is like selling a toy without batteries included.<p>Strangely Ubuntu feels like a premium product in comparison.  It comes with lots of good software pre-installed that just work.  The app store is filled with high quality free software with no spam or malware in sight.  A lot peripherals will just work without having to install new drivers.  In comparison Windows feels cheap and tacky.<p>Microsoft should sell Windows with Office bundled and make it expensive ($200+).  Include a collection of high quality free software to get people started and emphasise content purchases instead of apps.",1438441449

unfair to the users who get trapped in them, and figuring out who
eventually found their way to the official thread vs. whose jobs need
to be moved there is a royal pain.<p>Also, we&#x27;ve updated the FAQ to clarify that no one is allowed to submit job ads
as stories to HN. That includes YC startups, since the job ads we let them
post are not stories: they don&#x27;t have points or comments, and come in through
a different mechanism. So if you see a job ad in the form of a story, on
/newest or elsewhere, please flag it. Edit: this isn&#x27;t a rule change—we just noticed that not everyone knows what the rule is.",1438441235

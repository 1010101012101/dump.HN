209534,comment,208811,209494,0,0,brent,,,"I agree with plinkplonk, but if you'd like examples:<p>1) I mentioned multidimensional scaling elsewhere.  In the book there is implementation and it doesn't even say what the goal is (in terms of objective function) and/or how well it performs.  There are many different goals of multidimensional scaling.  If one understand even the objective function they are minimizing then the algorithm to do so will make more sense.<p>2) The book grazes over SVM's and makes a few blanket statements that I haven't heard from serious researchers.  E.g., ""[t]he one that is usually recommended ... is called the radial-basis function.  The radial-basis function is like the dot-product in that it takes two vectors and returns a  value.  Unlike the dot-product, it is not linear and can thus map more complex spaces.""  Most of the kernel/svm folks I know would never be so confident in saying such a blanket statement as it entirely relies on the data/situation.",1212626825

""<p>That is exactly what it  means. ""Deep math"" is not learned because people have nothing else to do with their time. The moment you try to apply or extend the techniques in PCI beyond the toy examples in the book you will see the need  for the ""deep math"".<p>Just one example. BackPropogation Neural Networks are covered very superficially PCI. To get a real understanding of BPNNs, read Chris Bishop's Neural Networks for Patttern Recognition. That's a whole book on <i>one</i> type of neural network.<p>I quote Peter Norvig's Amazon Review of Bishop's book.  (emphasis mine)<p>""To the reviewer who said ""I was looking forward to a detailed insight into neural networks in this book. Instead, almost every page is plastered up with sigma notation"", that's like saying about a book on music theory ""Instead, almost every page is palstered with black-and-white ovals (some with sticks on the edge)."" Or to the reviewer who complains this book is limited to the mathematical side of neural nets, that's like complaining about a cookbook on beef being limited to the carnivore side. If you want a non-technical overview, you can get that elsewhere, but <i>if you want understanding of the techniques, you have to understand the math</i>. Otherwise, there's no beef.""<p>""If you want understanding of the techniques, you have to understand the math"".\nWithout understanding you can't (a) judge the appropriateness of a particular algorithm to a data set (b) know which variant of the algorithm to apply (c) understand the results, especially when they don't make sense  (d) debug the implementation if required. In short at best you are making calls into a black box library and praying the results make sense.<p>PCI skips the ""understanding"" part of AI aIgorithms (which does need math as Norvig points out. Most AI <i>is</i> applied math)and provides a superficial outline and many blackboxes. E.g: the ""use libSVM for Support Vector Machines"" idea PCI propagates (after a very superficial overview of SVMs) .<p>LibSVM is a great library,but  trying to use it to  ""SVM ize"" your code  without understanding exactly how exactly SVMs work (which does need ""deep math"" ;-) ) , will give you ... ummm.. suboptimal ...  results.<p>One of my friends tried to use algorithms from PCI to add ""intelligence"" to some code for his startup (he first ported the PCI code to Ruby) and ended up getting nonsensical results. Eventually I looked at the data, threw  away   his code and replaced it with a  different algorithm which was appropriate. But, hey,  I got some equity in return for the AI code so that turned out all right :-P<p>All that said, I have no problems with folks using/liking PCI. I was just reacting to the ""deep tech"" phrase in the original post.",1212625824

Granted, in this case the algorithm presented DOES attempt to do this.  BUT, the algorithm presented is not ""multidimensional scaling"".  It is an implementation (not even a good one) attempting to minimize one of many possible objective functions.<p>I noticed several more when I flipped through it initially, but this is the type of thing I'm referring to.",1212625789

First starbucks.\nAlso, Seattle underground tour (town used to be one story lower), lots of history, deadly toilets and such. The namesake of Skid Road is downtown, where they used to slide all the timber down (poor people lived there)<p>Cross puget sound and go north around to the pacific - fantastic country down to OR. Watch beaches change from Olympic WA (western most point has a RV park by the indian res that will let you camp on the beach), to Imperial Beach in San Diego.<p>Hoh rainforest, the only rainforest in US over there.<p>Be sure to eat as much fresh fish/crab as possible, till you get LA and lower, switch to mexican...... mmm... fish tacos Lots of hole-in-the wall fish places to get smoked salmon instead of a candybar for a snack.<p>Oregon\ndid beaches mostly, cool dunes\nportland has the worlds smallest park:""Over the years, items have been added like a tiny swimming pool and diving board for butterflies, a miniature Ferris wheel and more.""<p>at the very SW corner (near cave junction), there is an ""ewok village"", a bunch of treehouses you can rent. multi-story, 40ft up, rope bridges, bonfire.. awesome.

Start of real mexican food. mmm...<p>Gamble on some horses in Delmar and hit the fun little ocean towns on the way down to san diego. Dont take the 5!! take the pacific coast highway. Sure it takes forever, but you've got time!<p>San Diego:\nGlider port (Torrey Pines?, north of LaJolla) big cliff hangliders/parasailers like to jump off. Bring bonoculars, its above Black's beach (nude). Famous modern architecture building.\nLaJolla has ""munchkind land"" (most is gated now, but you can get there if your sneaky). There's the beach full of seals (and seal's poop), but there's also a hidden on used to go to all the time, tourmaline or something. From there you can walk around beneath lajolla cliffs and its just you and the ocean.\nPacific beach probably has the most ""baywatch"" style beach.<p>Downtown there's a parking ramp that's built too high. Sit on top and watch the airplanes come in and read the writing on the landing gear tires. Its a thrill.<p>I think you can tour some of the military ships, I got on an aircraft carrier while they were in port. Amazing.<p>there's the cross (good view)\npoint loma has 360 panarama lookout.<p>Nearby on rosecrans, they'res Albertos Mexican food (California burrito has french fries) God love em.\nRubios - famous for fish tacos<p>Ocean Beach is over there, fun throw-back to the 60's kinda vibe.<p>Then it gets crappy down imperial beach to the border and TJ.<p>Vegas: yeah baby. I'd give you some spots, but its all bit hazy.<p>Utah: Zion is a short hop from vegas. A must see. I missed it, but heard bryce is good too.<p>Arizona: Another short hop gets you to the north rim of the grand caynon. Its more rugged than the south, less toursty.<p>The drive down to Flagstaff thru reservation is remote and majestic, like you're driving through a picture.<p>I had to get back so I bypassed em, but there's a petrified forest, rosewell, sedona (psychic vortex or some crap - hippieville), labrea tar pits and roswell.<p>The joy is in the places between places.

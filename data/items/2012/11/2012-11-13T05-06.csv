4776680,comment,4774864,4775673,3,0,sirclueless,,,"To me, the real deciding factor that tells me that LuaJIT will win in the long run is that LuaJIT traces the high-level semantics of Lua, whereas PyPy has to work with Python bytecode, which may have a considerable amount of lost information. There are some good examples in the lambda-the-ultimate thread (for example, optimizing based on the knowledge that HLOAD and ASTORE will never alias).<p>PyPy can't feasibly optimize the high-level Python AST, because the language is very large compared to Lua, and more or less behaviorally defined by Python's bytecode compiler.",1352786367

Two great examples that come to mind:<p>1. Mixpanel vs. Kissmetrics: Mixpanel gives me a free account that I can use for as long as I want to evaluate all the stuff I can do with it. KM gives me a 14-day trial. I'm the only developer working on this project which means that 14 days is not enough time to implement the changes I need and actually start to see the results. Going with Mixpanel for this one was obvious. I will reach their free 25k data points way before the first month so I have to get a real paid plan or put a banner on my website. In any way, they won already. Even if I wanted to switch to KM for the lower prices, exporting the data I currently have would be a hassle.<p>2. The New Basecamp: Although they don't offer a free plan anymore, they do have a 60 days trial. They don't really lose much by offering those extra days and after two months I'm already hooked to their service, I know how everything works, and most importantly, they have my projects tied down. The work of those 2 months is already there so even if I don't like the product, I'll probably pay for it so I don't have to export it. Joel Spolsky has a great article that talks about this retention thing (his specific example was with email providers) but I can't find it right now :(",1352785987

Shoppers avoid bad reviews like the plague, and there's normally so much competition that you can always find an alternative. The 1 time we gave a bad review, we had a call from the seller within 1 hour offering all manner of things for us to take it back.<p>(2) Delivery is excellent - next day courier services.

So, 10RMB (around 1) can get you national, next-day delivery for most small items (eg. a small parcel).<p>(3) The mobile site is awesome, full stop.<p>(4) There's just so much choice.

With the exception of forms, the huge, overwhelming majority of PDFs never use things like embedded objects (which, funnily enough, can sometimes be Flash files). And forms are definitely doable in a JavaScript PDF reader; they are, in fact, probably easier than in a native PDF reader since you'll be able to use HTML. So in JS, they can display almost any PDF in the world with no trouble at all. How many Flash programs are more complex than that little car demo, which runs slowly on my top-of-the-line hardware?<p>Why are we so afraid of native code these days? Firefox already runs plugins in a sandbox, and has done so since 3.6. There is more complexity and opportunity for screwups in unmanaged code, yes, and for a PDF JavaScript is just fine, but for something that requires a powerful, fast VM capable of real-time graphics and real-time user input without lag or freezes, it is silly to write off the benefit of performant native code just because Adobe's plugins are rife with security holes, which I believe is what is happening here.",1352784840

My manager marked me down for 'sand bagging' and when I inquired what he meant he explained that he had observed me sitting around, reading usenet, and basically goofing off for three months and then I sat down and wrote all the software less than a month. He complained that rather than bullshit about how long it was going to take to write I should have just written it and used the other three months to do work. Of course what ensued was me trying to explain that for 3 months I was trying to figure out <i>how</i> it needed to be written and then once that was all known actually writing it was trivial.<p>What I took away from that was that HW engineering had great milestones for things like circuit design, PCB layout, first films, first boards, design verification, manufacturing verification, production. But software only had, uuhhhhh, blam here it is.<p>I related that story to a friend who introduced me to a sculpture artist. She had the same 'process' except she would look at a rock for a month and then one weekend chip off all the parts of the rock that weren't part of the sculpture, but she had to 'see' it first before she could start chipping. Art. Not engineering.",1352783245

It is merely a string of bytes.  Theoretically, a monkey sitting at the keyboard might accidentally of typed the same string.  The product we build cannot be touched or held.  It will be worthless in just a few years.<p>A phone can be touched and held and yet it's also worthless in a few years. More worthless than f.ex. fly by wire software which will still work on aircrafts in those few years. Or ECU. Or gearboxes. Or microwaves. Most applications of various device firmware and machine operations software is legacy and guess what - it works. And contrary to material and moving parts, which must be replaced even if they work flawlessly, software can theoretically outlive it without any updates because it doesn't wear out.<p>Also, applying the infinite monkey theorem won't get you anywhere, ever.",1352783108

Sometimes the firm that you bought it from has folded (I've had this happen in the time it took to deliver the order) to the seller sending bricks. It is buyer beware to the extreme but usually for the price you are paying you can afford to lose the occasional shipment and still save money.",1352782909

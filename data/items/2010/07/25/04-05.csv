I can promise you this: there were more conversations about (and really, more time spent on) how to handle match making than any other topic. The whole company was absolutely passionate about trying to make sure people got matched well (how well they succeeded, I can't answer :).<p>I'm glad you liked Space Jam. I was really disappointed that the game turned out so basic. Some of the original ideas were much more interesting, but I guess they figured they wouldn't market as well to the target demographic (don't ask me what they <i>were</i>; it was a <i>long</i> time ago).",1280033971

This is true in SSE2 and Altivec, so you can do integer operations there - but since SIMD integer operations are limited too, it's pretty much only useful for flipping the sign bit.<p>Moving values between different register sets is INCREDIBLY slow since it involves at least two memory operations.<p>And faking FP operations with specialized integer code on something with soft-float like ARM might be worth it.

It's nearly meaningless for me to tell my software lead that a component is 80% ""done"" after a week, when the 80-90% gap could take a month, and 90%-100% might not even be attainable.  (I have a nearly impossible time ever considering something 100% ""done"".)<p>Coupled with dependencies and ""Waiting For"" or ""Requires"", it feels entirely like it's not an appropriate or truly representative model.  This has led to intense frustration and tensions.  Most of the developers on my current project dread the weekly Gantt chart update.<p>I most often find myself simply saying, ""whatever I said component A was at last week, add 1%"".  It leads to a massive disjoint as one moves further up the management chain.<p>I realize this is a mini-railing against something you might not even be intending to use them for.  I also realize that our software company may not be getting maximum utility out of the style of project management we use.  I only speak from a developer's perspective who has been frustrated time and again when faced with something so horribly artificial-feeling.<p><i>edit</i> For what it's worth, we use Microsoft Project.  I've also used dotproject for non-work related coding I've done, but never learned it fully enough to speak to its capabilities or strengths and weakenesses.",1280033392

1544977,comment,1543914,1544800,0,0,_delirium,,,"The LGPL doesn't require in-place modifiability, just that a user could build a working binary from a newer version of the LGPL'd library and your binary, along with appropriate dev tools and assuming no interfaces have changed. For statically linked C code, the LGPL suggests providing a linkable object file (.o) that the user can use to relink against newer versions of the library. I think that's already the case with Java apps by default, though, because a user can just dump new versions of the library's .jars in to your app, overwriting the old version. Even if you've slurped everything up into one big .jar, they can still extract the new .class files into the .jar, overwriting the old ones. Then they sign the app with their own key and install it on their phone.<p>In practice though most LGPL-software authors don't even seem aware of this clause (I wasn't until recently) and aren't inclined to enforce it.

I don't love, at all, working as one coder among 100 on a big project; I don't like implementing someone else's ideas.<p>So I'm not a programmer by trade, if that's what this question means. I took another of my passions that I did enjoy performing on more of a mercenary basis, and went to law school, and am presently a very happy lawyer. I write appellate briefs all day in a quiet office and when I come home in the evenings, I unwind by putting some music on and writing something that'll never make any money or do anything except make me happy with how beautiful and elegant it is.<p>I'm not committed against the idea of writing code as my trade, but I'm happy that I don't have to do it unless and until the right opportunity comes along. Maybe it never will, and I'll go on like this forever---that seems most likely, and would also be just fine with me. It will mean that I never let a great artistic love be ruined by stamping out CRUD database apps all day until I couldn't bear to start emacs. (Plus, emacs is great for writing briefs in. I also think I'm the only lawyer in the Department who's ever filed a brief formatted in LaTeX. Looked great.)",1280030961

Windows NT on RISC processors has proved to be limiting in that almost no software was available to platforms other than Intel. This means the only functions a Windows on ARM server would be able to handle would be those of Windows itself and the software Microsoft choses to port.<p>It's kind of a copycat reflex. Apple is investing a lot in ARM, porting a big chunk of their OS to it, so Microsoft is convinced it must do the same, regardless of having a viable product.",1280030917

1544938,comment,1544247,1544532,0,0,tansey,,,"Good summary.<p>> Why not minimize the front-running problem by making the dates you roll harder to predict? Instead of rolling the front month every month, why not include some basket of CL1 thru CL12 and find opportune times to roll?<p>While this is being done by some funds, I would think volume is an issue. I'm not very familiar with non-equity futures, so I could be wrong, but typically the front contract is the only one with significant volume for large funds. That is, until the contract gets near expiration, at which point volume slowly creeps up in the next contract.<p>However, the article mentions that at one point UNO was 86% of the natural gas market for the near contract. To me, it seems almost negligent if you're the fund manager to allow it to swell to that size. No wonder arbitrage funds are popping up to pick them off.<p>> Once these ETFs got popular, why not invest in some of the storage infrastructure and charge a slightly higher fee but give much better tracking to investors?<p>From the way the article describes the major banks, it seems like they're already doing something similar to this. I wonder if they offer ETFs with this structure.<p>The one thing I can't understand is why the CTFC thinks it should be trying to protect these ETFs from getting pre-rolled. There is nothing illegal going on here, it's just dumb, slow-moving fund managers getting taken advantage of by smart, nimble traders. An ETF which poorly tracks its underlying commodity's spot price should simply go out of business because people stop investing in it.",1280030699

Looking at one up close it's very easy to see why the thing exploded. The tires blew during take-off (expected to happen on any airline at some point) which sent rubber and metal shrapnel into the engine, causing a catastrophic explosion.<p>This new design ""avoids the fate"" simply because the engines are on top of the wings.<p>Why there's so much regulation behind ""wanting to go faster"" is mind boggling. The Concorde had some technical flaws, but the plane did a great job at what it was built for: getting people places faster. I hope this plane is able to bring back what we lost.",1280030632

And it's largely humans' fault.<p>The eath is undergoing massive climate change.  And it's largely humans' fault.<p>Humans are polluting their environment on an unprecedented scale.  We are causing enormous losses in biodiversity.  And this does not even begin to address the devastation that a large-scale nuclear war would cause -- something that's still a very real possibility.<p>Sure, Earth's geology will survive, as its surface is like the rind on an apple and it doesn't matter much to the Earth's interior what happens on the surface.. and we can barely affect the geology of the surface.<p>But we can and certainly do affect life on Earth.  Sure, humans might have a hard time killing off all life, but we're doing a pretty good job killing off a good fraction of it.  And yes, humans are a part of nature, but a particularly destructive part.",1308772797

2684880,story,,,3,6,wallawe,"Dispute with Web Design Company",,"To give a quick synopsis of what is going on, I hired a ""legitimate"" web design company to put together a very custom website for my first entrepreneurial venture. Without giving too much detail about the idea, I wanted to have them design an interactive map for the downtown area that I live in to bring the character and life of that area online.<p>After a great deal of research into what kind of programmer to use, local or foreign, freelancer or a company, I decided to use a local firm that I was referred to by a student of the company's owner. He is a professor at the university in town as well. He was extremely enthusiastic and seemingly knowledgeable about what I was going for. The price tag was around 10k with 2k required up front and the rest to be paid after the project was completed. The estimated time to complete the project was 8 weeks. A mobile version was to be included.<p>I agreed to the conditions and paid the 2k and letting him know I had to have it done by July (This was late February).<p>Fast forward to last week, 15 weeks in and the project was nowhere near completion. I let him know last Wednesday, the 15th, in a respectful manner that I was not pleased with the progress nor some some of the work they had done. We had originally agreed to use a different graphic designer but he used one in house that was cheaper. I receive no response so I emailed him again Monday mid-day to reiterate what I had said Wednesday. Keep in mind I was never rude in any way. His response later that afternoon appalled me.<p>He stated that I was clearly dissatisfied with their product and that unfortunately our relationship was irreparable. He then went on to describe that according to their term's of service there was no refund for deposits but he would be ""kind"" and give me half back ($1000) along with the map design that I expressed my discontent with and a dictionary for the database but no actual code. He attached a contract his attorney had drawn up and that was that.<p>Now I am a month and a half away from deadline, I have formed an LLC, and met with an accountant as well as several other businesses to set this venture up. I am losing half of my deposit. It will be very difficult to have this completed in time starting from scratch.<p>The legal loophole he used to bail on me is that they offer no warranties, expressed or implied, in their terms of service for their products or services. I just never imagined something like this would happen. I have tried contacting him and he is very short using only legal jargon and says he wishes me the best while maintaining he is doing me a favor. I am pretty sure he just doesn't have time because he is a professor and a PhD student finishing in December.<p>Is there anything I can do about this? Any advice is appreciated. This is a learning process and all I can do is view it that way but it is nonetheless extremely frustrating and unethical in my opinion.",1308772518

The vast majority of the value comes from what's not written down.<p>What's worse is that the ""signal to noise"" ratio detracts from my ability to understand what you're really going on about.<p>Some examples:<p>You say ""MongoStat is <i>Amazing</i>"" why? how? what does it do?

How can the things you've learned improve my practice?<p>You mention starting with 1.2 - does that mean you're not using 1.8?  I've used 1.2 and was suffering 80% - 99.9% CPU load, as soon as I updated to 1.81 the load dropped to closer to 0.03% for most of the same operations.  Does that mean your talk is invalid?

2684870,comment,2684372,2684455,6,0,jessedhillon,,,"You have a very slim chance at even breaking even, let alone getting the big payout. Your article, frankly, does more to convince people to become consultants, rather than the opposite.<p>The choice you present is as if a person with the motivation and insight to start something has no choice but to throw caution to the wind, abandon any semblance of stability, and burn the ships (as the saying goes). Plenty of very successful entrepreneurs have proven this wrong -- there is no need to romanticize a very risky proposition.<p>On the one hand, you present a choice where a lot of one's income is scalable and under your (mostly) direct control. Sure, there is a limit of around $250k/year -- that's a gross of $2M+ in a decade. Meanwhile, you have more flexibility with your time than you would at most jobs. The typical startup entrepreneur, if they last a decade, will have gone through multiple ideas/ventures in that time frame, while earning 10-20% of this.<p>On the other hand, you present the notion of taking a wild, largely unmitigatable risk -- live an austere lifestyle while devoting 60+ hours/week to your pet project. Your only way to manage risk is to try to confirm early-on in the process that you are actually building what people will pay for (or even want) ... <i>before you build it</i>. Even then, the territory remains largely unknown. Any number of black swans can swoop in and completely destabilize your agenda, turning what you think you know upside-down. You simply cannot plan for success -- high-risk proposals are always subject to wild fluctuations in the landscape (or else they wouldn't be high risk) -- the best you can reasonably plan for is to make a product and release it.<p>The end of your post does your argument no favors either. Establish a practice where I can sell my talent for (at maximum) $250k/year, or go work on one of four me-too ideas? There's a reason why the devs you approached said that they want to <i>work on their own idea</i>, or in lieu of that, consult.<p>EDIT: I'm sorry if this reads harshly. I tried to give you honest criticism without insulting you. I regret using the phrase ""me-too ideas"".",1308772461

This basically means you don't own what you create/upload - they could pass on your uploaded content to anyone (even for money) and you have no remedy against them. This also means no IP for you (since they are considered public domain)!<p>Second problem: The cost is sky high when you scale. Has anyone done a cost comparison b/w cloud based maintenence, hosting and deployment vs your own servers on maybe rented out racks? Compare backups and multi-nodal solutions.<p>Finally: You have no control over your stuff - what triggered this in my mind was when I saw how many companies have their sites taken down while they are being investigated for stuff they have very little control over vs. companies who own their infrastructure and thus need to be subpoena-ed or issued a warrant against to but taken down. For example, consider two scenarios of a popular company, say Facebook or Craigslist, let's make it FB. Now if FB is on the cloud and some teenager kills himself from being bullied through it then all the police have to do is ask the hosting company to take down FB while it’s under investigation. The hosting company wants to keep peace so it complies and FB can’t do a thing about it. On the other hand, if FB has its own infrastructure and the cops have an issue, FB can wave the middle finger at them until they get a order from a judge to shut their servers down, which is much, much harder for cops to do and they must make a strong case before getting such order. So basically my point here is you’re at someone’s mercy and could be driven out of business easily by the flick of a switch.<p>None of this is concrete, and is just a starting point. However, they are serious concerns, and I don’t think there is a better place than HN to ask this question. Please share your thoughts freely.",1308771691

Now, the cool believe is that you can offer you commission to others who will sell your items on their Facebook page, allowing you to reach additional potential buyers. Of course that means, even if you don't have any item for sale, you can show other peoples item on your Facebook page and make dollars with the commission you get for selling there stuff.you definitely want to know how to make dollars on Facebook? It can expand your business's reach beyond your wildest dreams. But you probably will need training to understand to market on Facebook.The very first thing you will understand is there are thousands of Guru's. Some very good, countless bad. Plenty of assume you know additional than how to log in to Facebook. So the very first step is too weed via them and get a fit for you and your pocket book.There are very good Facebook training systems out there. I found the very good ones offered some sort of totally free trail which is a perfect way to start. They believe in their service and are very good with you testing it out. If you can't test it with out paying skip it.You can try countless Facebook training systems for totally free. Beware the totally free gifts or trials that ask for your credit card number. The person who is making dollars on Facebook here is not you. It is only my opinion but No cost and Credit Card are mutually exclusive. Don't you want a program you can respect and trust? I don't respect or trust folks who are trying to trick me and I bet you don't either.Another thing to note is that Credits in Facebook are not just a gaming currency like Gold in World of WarCraft. With WoW gaming currency, the World of Warcraft management can release as significantly currency as they please, due to the fact it is their gaming world. Not so with Credits in Facebook: these credits are usable across the board, with ALL games and apps supporting the identical currency. The only entity that can release new or totally free Credits is Facebook itself - so unless you get the offer you from Facebook for totally free Credits for Facebook, searching for No cost Facebook Credits is like expecting totally free US Dollars from Ben Bernanke or Alan Greenspan. Not gonna occur! Ether is a web-site that you can make dollars on by giving guidance to folks over the phone or by chatting. But now, you can use their new application on Facebook to make dollars although giving guidance to folks over the phone. If you're very good at giving guidance, this may possibly be the way for you to make some extra dollars on Facebook. Also if you know a second language, this app makes it quick to teach others and make dollars. You set the rates and Ether provides a number that individuals can call. The call will then be forwarded to your personal telephone number.",1308770922

I guess it depends on what kind of contracts you are getting, but the client relationship has parallels both to the customer relationship and b2b relationships.  You often have to sell your ideas to your clients.<p>* How to build a lot of different things.  If it's software you're doing, you'll get more under your belt by contracting than working at one company for a long time.<p>* How to run a business.

While it stands for ""Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game"", it's been commonly dubbed as a half joke, ""many men online role playing girls"".

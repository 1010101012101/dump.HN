That means that I care about a world-wide disruption caused by (local) laws in the US. I read about those and follow the development of these laws to a point.<p>The article addresses the internet first (me included) and then talks about educating the US congress and throwing money at US lobbyists, while fixing the US system so that it doesn't _need_ this kind of involvement anymore.<p>I'm sorry, but that leaves me out.<p>- I cannot take part in the education of statesman overseas/abroad and doubt that they'd listen to me<p>- I certainly won't (especially on an individual level, but even corporate that would be waaaay weird and wrong) throw money at lobbyists in another country<p>- I'm not allowed to take part in the political system in the US, so I cannot realistically help with any systematic change<p>I think while you are, as I already admitted, entirely correct about the fact that Congress might affect the whole world, the article is still wrong in calling out to 'The Internet' to fix it.

He said it in a joking/light hearted way, but anyone who follows him regularly knows he's clearly not a fan of the Windows OS. Consequently, he spent the next few weeks apologizing and backpedaling, even going so far as to devote a segmen of the Verge talk show to ""prettifying"" Windows.<p>One of the few sites that takes the opposite stance is Tested.com. If those guys think a piece of hardware/tech is shit, they will say plainly that they think it's shit, and give you their reasons why. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not offended or regard them as ""biased"" when they state a clear opinion with reasons attached. Sometimes I agree with them.

Most arguments boil down to taste, and in some cases the social contract regarding tools that you've established with your team.<p>The question I have is if CoffeeScript in open-source \nJavascript libraries is a net positive or net negative for Javascript. I can see arguments for both sides, but if the stakes aren't discussed I can see a potential tragedy of the commons where there are increasingly two versions of every javascript library, the one written in Javascript that receives few contributions from those who spend most of their time in CoffeeScript and those written in CoffeeScript that receive few contributions from those who don't use CoffeeScript and haven't tooled their environment to work effectively with it.<p>Despite the contentiousness of this issue, I'm curious to hear what others think.<p>Please leave your personal preferences at home (your dev env) and try to only discuss the pros and cons of CoffeeScript being used in open-source libraries and the impact is has on our community.<p>Social issues, community issues and language evolutions are fair game.

A high school friend hired me and then we both eventually hired our third friend. So, three of the eight employees (including me) are high school friends. The three of us have been talking about starting our own company for a long time. We feel like we're in a good position to do so, right now. We've spent some time outside of work building a prototype and have presented it to some potential customers and they're wanting to pay for it.<p>How do we resign from this company in the best possible way?<p>We carry the majority of the work-load, here. Our boss moved away and does not even communicate with us more than once a week. He attempted to sell the company, with no success. So, we're all kind of sitting in limbo wondering what the plan for the future is. Our boss is a very temperamental person and somewhat of a loose cannon. The product that we're developing outside of work is in the same space as the company we work at, now. No, we do not have a non-compete or NDA formally signed. We did not verbally agree to anything, either. (These are all parts of the reasons we want to move on, also.) I cannot honestly see us quitting going over very smoothly, but it's something that I feel that I personally need to do. My future is stagnating here and I'm not learning anything. I'm facing a great opportunity to do something that I've been reading about other people doing, for the past two years since I found Hacker News.<p>Do you think there is any legal problems with three of us quitting, even if we stagger it out over a period of one or two months? It'll be a big blow to this company, but staying here is a bigger blow to our futures.",1324328422

When people receive something packaged as a compiler (a file->file traduction tool to invoke from the command line and to include in building scripts), they naturally understand it as a compiler, and judge its qualities as a compiler.<p>And by ""compiler"", I mean the informal concept that people spontaneously put behind gcc or javac, not any attempt to formally classify a kind of data conversion tool. Among associated expectations, there's this idea that the abstraction provided by the compiler doesn't leak: you generally don't need to know about ASM/bytecode while using GCC/javac. CS doesn't shield you from the generated JS, and as such, it falls short of most people's expectations about a compiler.<p>Looking at these expectations from a different perspective, as does Raganwald, is very interesting.",1324328421

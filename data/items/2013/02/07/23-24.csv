5185337,comment,5184957,5184957,3,0,dheavy,,,"I do meditate and it does help me solve problem on a large scale, with some perspective. But it's not magic, i.e. if I'm not in a calm room for long hours, I just can't code properly or be more productive.\nI used to have trouble sleeping (that's not really the case now) and I'd remain in bed doing nothing, expecting (hoping) sleep would come.\nThen I started noticing my breathing, and it became some sort of exercise. That was 7 years ago or so... Now every night I go to bed and I do the same routine: notice and control (more or less) my breathing, nothing else. I'm quickly engulfed by  thousands of thoughts and the trick is just maintaining the routine for as long as it takes for them to calm down, observing them in a non-judgemental way, waiting. It's a bit of a leap of faith, that part. I can hardly describe the sense of clarity that strikes me after that...\nI actually believe this simple routine helped me a lot in getting rid of a general anxiety I use to have when I was a teenager, and find a better sleep (with richly symbolic dreams during the night that proved to provide a lot of ""subconscient"" answers to day-to-day or creative problems), among other things.",1360281569

Instead, we have ""Printer Settings""<p>General<p>- Focus rectangles look ugly (should not use dotted lines; dotted line is too close to the text)<p>- Spacing of lines in tree view in Preferences looks too small to me.<p>- Way too many settings (examples: a toggle for graphics antialiasing?)<p>- Why is this still combined as a single application?<p>- In the Tools-Customize dialog, menu separator lines are drawn using hyphens, not by drawing a line.<p>- Striped dialog backgrounds in a Mac App released in 2013?<p>- Help menu's ""What's this?"" item does not appear to do anything (its feedback is a pointer change, but that change does not happen if there is no window below the mouse.

One of the most important metrics is the number of citations an article acquires. If an article is published and, over the next 20 years, is only cited 3 times, we can say that it failed to influence its field, but if an article accumulates 1,000 citations, we can say that it definitely had some impact.<p>Then I thought about PHP, and how it compared with other languages. I went to Google and started searching:<p>influenced by gosling java<p>influenced by hickey clojure<p>influenced by matz ruby<p>influenced by  Stroustrup C++<p>influenced by larry wall perl<p>and then finally:<p>influenced by lerdorf php<p>You look through some of those links and you notice a difference. A lot of people write about the brilliant things that have been said by Gosling and Hickey and Matz and Larry Wall and Stroustrup but no one ever cites Ramus Lerdorf as an inspiration, nor does anyone seem to think he has ever said anything especially brilliant or insightful. I'm sure if you dig you might find exceptions, but as a rough metric of who has influenced who, I think this reveals something important about how computer programmers perceive the quality of PHP and one of its core contributors.<p>(You could counter-argue that PHP has several core contributors, in which case, I would counter-counter-argue by asking that you please suggest a core contributor to PHP who is quoted with the same admiration expressed for the other architects that I've listed here.)",1360280140

I'd like to see a chart like that for the Air.<p>The comparison in the article is with the Macbook Air, which is a laptop, not a laptop/tablet hybrid. I think this is instructive, however. My understanding is that there is no hibernation file and pagefile on an iPad. It's not trying to be a laptop. Likewise, there is no recovery partition on the iPad. (And I see very little need of one.)<p>The Surface Pro is a laptop in a tablet format. It's basically an old stylus tablet PC from the early 2000's done with 2012 technology, capacitative touch, and some design ideas from iPad style tablets layered on top.<p>Like my old tc1100 stylus tablet PC, you can use it for the same use cases as an iPad. However, there are important differences:<p>Holding it in bed would be a bit of a stunt. I can do it with my tc1100 if I rest my elbow on the bed and balance the thing along its diagonal through the center of gravity, with the corner resting firmly in my palm, whereas holding the iPad is like holding a book: something I don't have to think too much about. (That said, the iPad is already at the upper limit of what's tenable for me to not notice weight wise.)<p>Like the old tc1100, I have to be mindful of vents. A total non-issue with the iPad. I don't know what term there would be for this quality, but it's like a magic slab of touchable light. Having to think about vents ruins that.<p>Like the old tc1100, I would have to be mindful of battery <i>per work session</i>. To give credit where credit is due, the battery on the Surface Pro lasts 2X as long. However, I can put the tc1100 to sleep and hot-swap battery, so one extra battery gives me as much work endurance.<p>Basically, they're missing three of the essential qualities that make the iPad great as a tablet. I think they would've done better to go whole hog on the tablet/laptop hybrid idea like the IdeaPad Yoga and the Inspiron Duo. By pretending to be a tablet, they're setting up a bunch of expectations that aren't gong to be met. The tablet/hybrid is good enough for occasionally folding up as a tablet and passing around at a meeting, and doesn't seem to carry expectations beyond that.<p>Also, what benefit is there to be had from a tablet/laptop hybrid that I couldn't get from an ""ultrabook"" laptop with an 8.9"" tablet? Instead of one device that's mediocre as a tablet and a laptop, I could have two devices that are great in each situation, for little additional weight. (For one thing, I could use the hybrid with a Wacom digitizer to do double duty as a poor-man's Cintiq, but that's kind of niche.)",1360279216

An Intel SSD 525 with the same 128GiB of NAND reserves 12.6% spare area, so it presents 111.8GiB to the OS. The author's MacBook Air seems to have about 11.7% spare area.

Men are physically more capable at labor-intensive roles that don't necessarily need the type of education currently provided in K-12 outside of vocational schools and shop classes. That doesn't mean they're not smart, it just means they may know what they want out of life and know what it takes to do it (i.e. taking over his father's business).<p>I'd love to see our education system provide both academic- and career-oriented pathways that bring back apprenticeships.

It's that 98% of people don't want, or don't know they want, a pen tablet. Now, before the iPad, 98% of people didn't know they wanted a tablet. That's a fair point. But in the last decade, Microsoft has demonstrated zero market making ability of that kind.<p>On top of that, Surface Pro is probably not the ideal pen tablet for current technology. I think a cheaper, lighter, thinner device with a Clovertrail processor, digitizer, and 8+ hours of battery life would have hit the sweet spot if Microsoft wanted to make a serious go at making pen computing happen.

4013062,comment,4012718,4012971,2,0,jinushaun,,,"The current python.org homepage is a mess geared towards developers that already know Python. Compare that with ruby-lang.org and nodejs.org, which both seem geared towards promoting adoption of the language by newbs. They're organised with a clear information hierarchy that makes it easy to find the download button, get started on tutorials and find docs.<p>Python.org, on the other hand is a jumble of text. The download section is hard to find. The boxes in the right column are more prominent than the boxes in the left column, even though the content of the left column is arguably more important. The middle section is dominated by news that is, for all intents and purposes, worthless to me. There is no visual separation between when the description stops and the news section starts. Unlike nodejs.org, there is no shout-out to companies that are using Python or popular Python libraries, etc. The homepage needs to answer the 5 W's: who is using Python, what is Python, where can I download it, when is the next release, and why should I learn Python? And don't forgot how: How can I get started?<p>This is basic information design.",1337781581

4013020,comment,4012596,4012943,4,0,ghenne,,,"In our case (NS Basic/App Studio) we wrote a translator for VB style BASIC to JavaScript.<p>We wanted to create a cross platform development that could target iOS, Android and other mobile platforms. We started the project about 2 years ago, and saw a few key developments in the JavaScript space.<p>1. HTML5: the extensions did a lot to move it from a web scripting language to something that could be used for real applications. The Cache Manifest allowed the developer to specify a list of files to be stored on the device, so the app could run offline, with no access to a server.<p>2. Home Screen: The mobile platforms added the ability to pin web apps to the Home screen with their own icon, making it possible to start them much like native apps.<p>3. Performance: Work by the browser folks on the internals of the JavaScript engine resulted in huge boosts in performance. The results are in this table: <a href=""http://www.nsbasic.com/speedtest.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsbasic.com/speedtest.htm</a>. You can see the transition from early BlackBerrys being able to run a few hundred JS loops per second to the Motorola Xoom at 718,000. The benchmark is simplistic, but the message is clear: JavaScript on mobile device is 1000 times faster than a few years ago.<p>It turned out that it was fairly straight forward to write the Translator. Yes, there were enough weird edge cases to question anyone's sanity to do this again, but the result works well. All the control structures translated one to one, so there was little or no drop in performance.<p>We then built a Visual Studio style IDE around it, with support for frameworks like jQuery Mobile, jqWidgets and Sencha to build a complete dev environment. It's been a lot of fun.<p>(and yes, you can use JavaScript instead of BASIC if you want!)",1337781206

British law is largely unwritten - until the EU gave us them we had no written bill of rights and most of our laws are based on precedent rather than anything parliament has decreed. If you do the immigration test one of the things you might be asked is what sort of constitution Britain has (correct answer ""an unwritten one""). To try and understand Britain based on what is theoretically true is an exercise in futility that will rapidly lead you away from anything resembling reality.<p>I don't know if you have to live here to really understand it but what you imply simply doesn't tally with the way the Royal family are viewed. It's a strange combination of soap opera, duty, alien otherness and sentimental fondness. For most people there's more of a feeling of pity for them than any idea that they're better than us. They are an anachronistic anomaly but that's how they're viewed - so different, so outside that the comparisons you make really aren't there, any more than you'd compare yourself to something in a museum.<p>Now that's obviously not true of everything to do with the class system which at it's top levels embodies almost everything you say (the Prime Minister for instance is to me far worse, an elitist fop with none of the Royal family's sense of duty or propriety) but to pick on the Royal family is a little like protesting against BP by not buying sweets in their garages when you're filling up your car with petrol - it's really not the problem.",1337781085

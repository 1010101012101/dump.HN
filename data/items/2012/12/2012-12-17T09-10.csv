The fact that cursive in US is considered some kind of special writing and is uncommon was one ot the biggest ""This year I learned"".

The same goes for high powered fully automatic military style rifles. Zero use for hunting an animal, perfectly tailored for hunting humans.

Fighting the root is <i>really</i> hard and will take America generations of effort.

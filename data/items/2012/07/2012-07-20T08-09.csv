For a large swathe of applications it does the job just fine. There's little point in trying to pretend otherwise. Where PostgeSQL really fits in is when the next step is needed, either because the app has outgrown what MySQL can offer or there are some use (edge) cases where PostgreSQL does a better job.

4270003,comment,4268525,4268792,0,0,jvdongen,,,"I actually have implemented a multi-tenant application based on Postgres 3 years ago and we have been using it in production ever since (for paying customers that is). As such I have some experience in this field and I'm actually in the process of moving (back) to a model where each customer has its own database (and application process). For context: I have a relatively low number of tenants (tens) which in turn each have mid-hundreds to many thousands of active users (the largest tenant has just about 10k active users).<p>Unless you think you will have many hundreds or thousands of tenants (!= users) any time soon, I'd advise you to stick with one db per tenant.<p>The reasons for backing out of the use of schemas for multi-tenancy are for me:<p>* on a smaller scale (with regards to number of tenants, not users) it does not really offer any significant benefits in resource usage over one db per tenant, which makes the following reasons significant:<p>* lack of isolation - unless you use a separate database user with carefully set permissions for each customer it is possible to access each schema from a single compromised application process. If you do actually use a separate db user for each customer, one of the benefits of using schemas as opposed to separate db's disappear (you can no longer share db connections/db backends across requests from different end-users so the number of concurrent database connections increases).<p>* complexity - multi-schema use is usually not supported by default in common web frameworks and related tools. I use Django and had to create a custom db driver (and leverage thread-local storage) to get any sort of transparent support for multi-schema use (and especially in this case you <i>want</i> transparency for your developers - otherwise risk of isolation failure increases to the same level as with the 'one db/tenant_id in table' approach - see previous point). Also backup/restore becomes more complicated. And Django's management tools (the manage.py script) had to be taught a new trick. And South, the schema migration tool had to be ... You get it I guess. It works - sure, but took quite a bit of work to get right and there is always the risk that future updates to any standard packages used break it again. I'd rather not have it.<p>* one schema per tenant implies also one application process for all (or at least multiple) tenants. This again makes it more complicated to keep things secure and you'll run into some other issues as well depending on the requirements for your application.<p>One of those issues we've run into (not related to the database) is that we're in the position that we can definitively benefit from a 'one source code base for all' but still have to be able to customize our application per tenant with respect to the specific wording of certain aspects in the user interface and that in multiple languages. In the current setup (one application process for all) it meant that we could not use Django's native i18n machinery. Building an alternative (with proper version control in this case) was not as much fun as you may think and basically a mistake. In the setup we're migrating to we can leverage the native i18n features of Django (and git) for this job.<p>So where we're going now is:<p>* one virtualenv per tenant, with a dedicated Django project for each tenant (the Django project does not contain the actual application code, only settings and if the need arises customized .mo/.po files.)<p>* one application process per tenant (I use uwsgi with emperor mode for this)<p>* one database per tenant (hosted on a Postgresql master/slave pair)<p>The resulting setup is easier to maintain and reason about than the current setup and my testing so for shows that resource-wise it does not make a significant difference. There is of course a bit more disk usage and a bit more memory usage. That is mostly because of the extra copies of the application code I need to keep around on disk and in memory - but that is all together a relatively minor bit of the total disk and memory usage so percentage wise it does not really make a difference (at least for us - is probably very situation dependent).<p>Something I'd been worried about was the number of concurrent database connections. But after some testing that fear turned out to be unnecessary as even under very high load the number remained within manageable bounds.<p>EDIT: formatting.",1342773852

Is the fact that app.net paid enough to draw people away from Twitter & Facebook? As a developer, perhaps, but as a user, I really doubt it.<p>A much better sales pitch would be just ""you own your data"". Give users amazing import/export tools from the get go. Allow third parties to fork your system and allow seamless user migration. Build a protocol, not a service.<p>With a business hat on, I also worry about the single silo of data in app.net. Say it does become successful, then they're a monopoly again. How can we be sure they'll fairly charge for their API usage when they realise how much it costs to hosts that much real time data? Can we be sure they won't change the playing field again?<p>Besides all that, I don't get why he wants $500,000 up front. If he wants to ""align our financial incentives with members & developers"", I would have thought he'd charge a set fee to allow revenue to scale with usage.<p>Also the language on the site is just so damn confusing. They have lots of ideas jammed in together. Most of the discussion about the idea has been people trying to figure out what they're on about. They need to figure out a sales pitch people can understand and stick to it.<p>Anyway, lots of huge holes in this implementation IMO. I doubt it'll even get funded.",1342773035

The reasons vary, but it generally has to do with scaling up the system into more modularized components and using data stores better suited for particular sub-problems that the ""big honking database"" was used previously.<p>To be clear, I'm not really suggesting you avoid using fancy features in data stores like Redis or Solr. The relational database, with history as a guide, tends to be the first data store a system starts with, and ends up having everything thrown into it even if it is not the right tool for the job. Over time, chunks of data end up being moved out of the relational monster into other data stores. If your relational database choice is tightly coupled with your  implementation, then you'll have a harder time moving things like your search engine into Solr, your queue into RabbitMQ, your counters into Redis, and so on. And yes, you'll also have a hard time moving to a different relational database, which I've also seen happen (on a massive, massive scale actually.)<p>If you stick to using an ORM that provides few leaks in its abstraction, write non-clever SQL, model things relationally using the standard types, generally speaking moving <i>parts</i> of a system out of a relational database into different data stores goes from being nearly impossible to being merely difficult.",1342772716

While everything works fine, after months of using it I find writing programs for and with MySql or MSSqlServer seems easier. 
One specific complaint I have is that there is no transaction control within pgsql stored procedures (functions). I had to kludge the db link module to get transactions to work.
Another related complaint is the DB Link module has poor functionality when compared to MSSqlServer's DB Link. I brought this up yesterday at the PostGres booth at OSCON and they said they're aware of it. No news on when they'll get around to fixing it.<p>A feature we miss is MySql's ability to use different DB engines such as Archive or Memory. AFAIK there is no equivalent to these in Postgres. We put mysql's Archive engine to good use before we migrated our app. Now we have to export data to gz files via script.<p>In general I don't think there is a strong reason for the  majority of apps to switch to Postgres when MySql works for most needs.

But international relations are never fair game, think about it, especially in this case where many nations are feeling very insecure at the news that a nation partially controlled by religious extremists with an open belief in accelerating the apocalypse is developing nuclear energy. The gloves are off. The only problem is public support, which is easy enough on the right-wing, let's sort out the cavemen across the ponds collective, but the left wing, respect foreign cultures is much more difficult. And that's the only reason a government will even pretend to 'play fair'.<p>Iran are being crafty. For all intents and purposes their internal movements and actions regarding nuclear energy have been equal to or lesser than the actions that other nations have carried out. They deny development of nuclear weapons. They allow talks. The posture in response to threats. They allow more nuclear auditing than Israel ever has. This is their veil of fairness. By playing coy they leave foreign groups to doubt their intentions and question their own governments stance, thus limiting what the government can do.<p>Anonymously however it's all out aggression already. The assassinations, suicide bombings, drone attacks and disguised oil tankers that can only be indirectly attributed to each side have only a limited impact on the public, so the governments employ them freely.<p>Is it slowing down Iran?

For now it will continue until one side oversteps the mark and can be held accountable for their actions. If America overstep they'll be set back. If Israel overstep it could ignite the beginning of even more severe conflict in the area.

4269918,comment,4269649,4269649,21,0,tikhonj,,,"It's funny--I've just spent several days realizing exactly the opposite. Namely, programming <i>is</i> algebra. Not high school algebra, granted, but abstract algebra. I've seen patterns from abstract algebra come up several times in programs I've worked on recently, but I didn't know enough about the subject to take advantage of them. Abstract algebra has definitely moved up on my list of subjects to learn soon!<p>Abstract mathematics aside, this article is a perfect case for using Scheme as an introductory language. Scheme does not have false cognates in its syntax--it practically doesn't have syntax at all! C-style assignment syntax <i>is</i> needlessly confusing; the only reason people still use and teach it is because they're acclimated to it.<p>Scheme has some other big advantages as well. It's <i>exceptionally</i> simple, so there is much less incidental complexity to trip up the student. Additionally, it has far less magic than other languages. Assignment is built into the language, but the syntax isn't: changing a variable looks much like calling a normal function. The same is true for OOP. I found this a big advantage--it's much easier to see that OOP is not the one true way, and that there is no one true OOP way, when things like classes and inheritance are not built into the language. Scheme shows OOP for what it really is: a design pattern that can be useful in certain cases. Compared to a dogmatic language like Java, this is a breath of fresh air!<p>Scheme is also very multi-paradigm. It supports functional programming far better than any mainstream languages but also supports imperative and OO programming well as well. You can even reuse the same syntax for nondeterministic or logic programming. The best bit is that it supports all these paradigms in very similar ways--it lets them stand on their own merits rather than pushing you towards or away from any of them.<p>The most important idea in computer science is abstraction, and Scheme is extremely well-suited for teaching students about it. Beyond this, Scheme is also just a fairly pleasant language to use for normal tasks.",1342771826

What he is thinking about is indeed as he said transactions.

Your Ubuntu binary worked fine.<p>Looks quite nice, and there certainly is a need for more PostgreSQL GUIs. Some feedback from the minute I used it:<p>- You don't handle bytea columns very nicely. I'd expect those to be displayed in hex or so.<p>- Browsing a table is very slow on tables with large columns. I was testing on a table with a ~10KiB text column.<p>- I personally prefer a more compact interface, having an option for smaller buttons would be a good start. :-)<p>(Edit: formatting)",1342771655

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.</i><p>Notice how it doesn't sell itself as ""javascript on the server side"" or anything like that.<p>It sells itself on two points:<p>- A platform that runs on top of Google's V8 (fast)<p>- It fixes I/O blockage by using events and callbacks (aka evented I/O)<p>In other words, it's all about scalable backend services.<p>If you think Node's approach is a good way to handle blocking IO, good for you.<p>I happen to think it's a terrible approach. And I think there is a much more viable alternative out there for backend developers who have performance concerns: whether it's related to IO blockage, or the general slowness of interpreted languages.",1342771624

I'm not sure how the FF permissions work, and frankly, the extensions infrastructure is one that leaves me a bit queazy.

The statements made in this article seem pretty derisive towards MySQL, a system I like for its flexability, easy integration, and power.

Just when people started to forget how much they hate Microsoft and how embarrassing it is to work there...<p>""Should Apple care what people like me think? What difference does it make if they alienate a small minority of their users?<p>There are a couple reasons they should care. One is that these users are the people they want as employees. If your company seems evil, the best programmers won't work for you. That hurt Microsoft a lot starting in the 90s. Programmers started to feel sheepish about working there. It seemed like selling out. When people from Microsoft were talking to other programmers and they mentioned where they worked, there were a lot of self-deprecating jokes about having gone over to the dark side. But the real problem for Microsoft wasn't the embarrassment of the people they hired. It was the people they never got. And you know who got them?

Essentially, it provides a generator façade for what is underneath the surface a bucket being filled by four threads (""goroutines"") concurrently. Unless things have changed markedly, it would be very difficult in Python to create a generator which produces its values with the help of some number of threads.\n</code></pre>\nThis is actually very easy in Python -- use a Queue[1], spawn some threads to populate it, and read from it in a generator.<p>Go seems interesting, but many/most of its praised features are already done better in other languages. For example, while it supports ""thousands of goroutines"" (green threads), Haskell supports millions of green threads[2]. Even Stackless, which is not known for performance, has faster gthreads[3].<p>Go also perpetuates several mistakes from C (ugly brace-delimited syntax) while dropping the true genuinely useful features (pointer arithmetic, manual memory management). Considering the wealth of high-quality, high-performance languages with mature library and compiler support (Haskell, Erlang, Factor, OCaml, even Ada), I'm mystified as to why Google would invest the time and energy into promoting yet another C clone.<p>I suppose in a year, Go will be another mostly-abandoned language with a few users poking around the mailing list asking ""what happened?"".

At my university there was suppose to be a place for undergraduates to research and work together, but sadly the unviersity turned it into a conference room. Most of my friends in CS that are terrible programmers were simply never taught the proper way to program or even remotely how to tackle a problem. Its sad to tutor other students and they understand the problem but they have no idea where to start or how to implement a solution. I think CS programs should definately teach how to problem solve as opposed to just finish the project for the grade. My parents enforced good study habits in me and it is apparent in my friends/roommates that did not have it instilled in them. If universities did teach students how to study and manage time I am sure a lot of the ""bad"" students would be right on up there. Lastly I also find it very hard to believe how many crappy professors are still allowed to teach. In fact I had one professor in a basic studies class say ""I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT ME! CALL ME AN ASSHOLE! IM TENURE! I DON'T CARE!"". I've also had professors that simply cannot teach at all.

I don't hold up the following analysis as Truth, just some thoughts.<p>In the short term, even for several years, Microsoft could match any revenues to a news company that it chose. In the long term, though, the news company faces two outcomes: Bing essentially succeeds, and Bing essentially fails. In the first case, they essentially win and everything's hunky-dory. In the second case, they lose any independent market existence they have and become a Microsoft vassal, dependent on the Microsoft payoff to survive on the net.<p>So, taking this offer from Microsoft is effectively betting that Microsoft can successfully dethrone Google and beat them at their core competency. As a person interested in the software industry who has watched Microsoft thrash around in numerous fields over the past couple of decades, and scoring only one modest success outside of Windows and Office in that time frame (the games division, which still isn't in the Office/Windows league by any means), this is not a bet I'd care to make. I have no idea how a news company would see this, though.<p>(BTW, I'm judging ""success"" by ""profit"". Very few things at Microsoft make money. I believe the XBox division did finally break even fairly recently, and that makes them a rarity, and I could be misremembering.)<p>It seems to me it's going to be hard to convince a company to be the first to jump ship. ""Hard"" here of course mostly means ""will take more money"", but still, to pull this off successfully it seems like Microsoft will need to get not just one news organization, but several, and match it up with a very big, very expensive advertising campaign to boot.<p>It might work... but it seems to me it's more like a ""Hail Mary"" than a sound plan. But Hail Marys do sometimes work; I'm not saying it's impossible.",1258953219

It's sexy having your site be covered by NY Times, Techcrunch, Gigaom, and all these publications, but it's no guarantee of success... I mean, whatever happened to Hipster????<p>Rather than focus on publicity, people should hang out in the communities where their target audience is.

3391937,comment,3390943,3391561,3,0,hippich,,,"I am sorry. I was talking about why _perl_ programer (I am the one) should prefer lambdish syntax over classic one. The way perl functions defined below is pretty standard today:<p><pre><code>  sub something {\n    my ($a, $b) = @_;\n    do_something_with($a, $b);\n  }\n</code></pre>\nParameters in perl functions passed in @_ array. This is also default variable for many internal function, like shift(), which returns first value from array, and shift it to the left by one element. So your function might be defined like this:<p><pre><code>  sub something {\n    my $a = shift();\n    my $b = shift();\n\n    $a + $b;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nor:<p><pre><code>  print sub { shift() + shift() }->(1,2);\n</code></pre>\nIf function do not use return(), last statement result used as return value of the function.<p>So perl already have everything you need to do lambda-style programing. And I was wondering why new syntax for something already existing. Or I could be wrong if this did not exists before and I am missing something.",1324860812

Suggest something I <i>want</i> to do that will justify giving you my email address?<p>More pedantic notes on design:<p>(1) There is far too much text in general and the font is too small.<p>(2) Profile spacing is really bad. Top/bottom whitespace is not symmetrical and photos don't have equal padding on all sides. Profile content also crowds far-left, leaving a huge swathe of whitespace in the center of your webpage.<p>(3) Remove the text telling people they can't signup unless they're in New York. You will need all of your visitors to test the attractiveness of your splash page and iterate towards something that is more viral.<p>(4) There are too many signup boxes. Your signup box is your notification box. And you should remove it until someone asks to signup. Let a single button trigger a lightbox that asks for no more than someone's email address and location. Mail them their password.<p>(5) Telling people to go through the work of creating an account, filling out their profile, inviting friends, and browsing stranger profiles is not telling them how the service works. It is telling them to go away and never come back.<p>(6) The color red really jumps off the page. Using it for the signup button is smart. Using it more than once is less smart, especially since the first red profile button overshadows your signup button in visual hierarchy, and then the remaining buttons undermine the signup button by pulling my attention downwards and away.<p>(7) There is a lack of design consistency in user profiles. Some have signatures and some don't. Quite seriously, why don't you just put a number of photos there so you maximize the chance of me seeing someone I find attractive?<p>(8) If you want me to invite my friends, there has to be a non-weird reason for why I would do this.<p>Intended as constructive feedback.

My counter-argument is that for multi-tenant hosting like tumblr where millions of people keep their personal blogs, keeping posts in a database is common sense because they're a known quantity. Backup strategies, optimization techniques, operations procedures are all well known and battle tested.<p>Also, creating content using a web-based editor that saves to a database is very easy for not-so-technical people to wrap their minds around. Static site generators? Not so much.",1324857858

If the New York Times featured my photo on the front of its Travel subsite, I would bet my Flickr photo page would get a negligible number of hits...it's as another HN commenter noted, HN provides more click-throughs because HN only provides links, not articles.<p>I would also wager that the NYT Travel section gets fewer than 150,000 views a day...but in terms of bragging rights, if I were to try to shop my portfolio around as a professional photog, front page of the NYT Travel would mean a lot more than front page of Reddit/pics.<p>If you were a VC investor, would you be more willing to evaluate a startup that made it to the front of HN or was validated by a TN post?",1324857749

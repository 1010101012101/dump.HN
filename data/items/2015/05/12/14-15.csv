We mine and process litigation data which is used for a number of law-related purposes. As others have mentioned, Thomson and LexisNexis have the law firm market nearly locked down (for the time being, at least, as even this is changing), so we decided to target a slightly different space. We focus on legal vendors -- those selling into law firms and in-house counsel -- and provide them with very useful data and information for their sales/marketing efforts.<p>This strategy -- not targeting the law market head on -- has proved beneficial, and has allowed us to establish a base from which to expand to adjacent verticals (law firms, in-house counsel, legal recruiters, etc.)<p>We have a few competitors (Lex Machina, DocketNavigator, LawProspector, others) but they each tend to carve out a niche. In the case of Lex Machina and DocketNavigator, both are entirely focused on 1) law firms, and 2) patent litigation.

Note that even within the sector of new-fangled hyped languages (Rust, Go, Julia, Nim etc.), it might not be the one with the biggest library/package selection that wins -- or else we&#x27;d probably never stopped using Perl -- but it&#x27;s pretty much required if you want to compete in the first place.",1431442651

Thank you for loading this content. Your browser retrieved it from the browser of someone currently viewing this page. You&#x27;re now a part of the network and someone who loads this page in the future may get it from you!<p>The server does not store this content anywhere, so as soon as the last person closes their browser, it&#x27;s gone. You can see a count of how &quot;healthy&quot; the page is (how many people are viewing the content) at the top.<p>How does it work?\nAt a high level, this is what happens:<p>From the homepage you enter the content you want to share.\nWhen you submit it, you register the SHA-256 hash of the content on the server.\nYour browser stands by with an open websocket to the server.\nWhen someone else visits a link &quot;/[sha256hash]&quot;, the server tries to retrieve the content from anyone registered with that hash. The server double checks the hash of the content it gets and then passes it along to the new person.\nThat new person now registers with the server as someone who knows the content for that hash.\nBut why?\nJust a simple experiment to play with websockets and concurrency.<p>The app is built in Elixir (compiles to erlang) with the Phoenix framework, since it supports websockets out of the box. It&#x27;s very &quot;railsy&quot; and in addition to rails-style &quot;controllers&quot;, it has &quot;channels&quot; which are like controllers for websockets. Made building this thing a snap.<p>The app is hosted on a heroku 1X dyno and I&#x27;m hoping this hits the front page of HN to see how many concurrent connections I can squeeze out of it. Erlang is known for its concurrency, so I&#x27;d love to know how Elixir/Phoenix can serve as an alternative to my usual rails when highly concurrent solutions are needed. I plan to tweet my findings, so you can follow me (@losvedir) if you&#x27;re interested in them.<p>Where do we go from here?\nThere are two aspects to this project that I&#x27;ve found quite interesting, that I hope people explore:<p>Peer-to-peer over browser websockets\nDoes something like this exist? I opted for P2P of HTML injected into a container div, since I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the legalities of clients sharing binary files back and forth. But someone wanting to deal with DMCA and all that might have an interesting service here.<p>I could see this being a great alternative to something like sendfile (I think that&#x27;s a thing?), or DropBox, or what have you, when you just want to send a file to a friend and it&#x27;s too big for email. Big files could even be broken up into individual SHA-256&#x27;ed pieces, and the list of SHA-256 hashes could be the thing sent. The other side would then fetch each piece in turn and re-assemble.<p>But that&#x27;s starting to sound kind of like BitTorrent... I wonder if someone could even make a web-based bittorrent client along these lines.<p>Content addressed web\nThe cool thing about the page content being represented by its SHA-256 hash is that it doesn&#x27;t matter where the content comes from. If anyone sends you the content, you can verify that it&#x27;s what you were looking for. This makes it well suited for peer-to-peer or otherwise distributed file serving.<p>Imagine essentially an archival service where all kinds of content (web pages, mp3s, videos, etc) are indexed according to their SHA-256. Hopefully this content would be distributed around the world and backed up and all that good stuff. Then if someone tweets a &quot;hey, checkout this video I made [a2b89..]&quot;, it can be retrieved from this &quot;global store of all content&quot; using that hash. It&#x27;s already very common to mention the SHA-256 alongside a download. Just think if you could take that and download from this service.<p>Wikipedia is an amazing collection of knowledge in terms of articles. It seems like it would be valuable to have a similar nonprofit service that was a repository of &quot;notable&quot; files.<p>A quick warning\nI don&#x27;t do any sanitization of the shared HTML content, so be wary of other links that folks may post. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too great of a security risk, since there&#x27;s nothing private here (no https), and you shouldn&#x27;t be trusting me any more than any other random internet person.<p>In closing...\nThanks for checking this out! Feel free to fork the repo on github and play around with it yourself!<p>And a big thanks to the friendly folks on the #elixir-lang IRC channel who have been very helpful in building this.<p>A (more) permament version of this content can be found here.",1431442510

And it&#x27;s confirmed by 7zip benchmark.<p>In theory Elbrus can dispatch 23 non-SIMD ops per cycle, it has only 6 integer units and 4 among them can do FP, so it&#x27;s not clear what remaining 17 operations can do. Modern x86 CPUs have about the same number of integer/FP ALUs.<p>Current IPC is quite good, but it&#x27;s hard to tell if core clock can be increased without lowering IPC. If ALU pipelines are short, it may be difficult to increase frequency without adding more stages. If more stages are added then pipeline flushes due to unpredicted jumps will result in heavier penalty. And it looks like Elbrus doesn&#x27;t have a branch predictor at all. Pipeline stalls caused by memory access will also increase with CPU frequency. In x86 CPUs they are somewhat masked by out-of-order execution and SMT, which Elbrus doesn&#x27;t have, so it should depend on memory preload instructions inserted by compiler.",1431442371

And since I&#x27;m talking about the first time, moving the data across the network wouldn&#x27;t be that bad.  After that, yes, of course it will still likely be hot, just as you describe.&quot;<p>My only real response is, I think it depends on how much data, versus how much code you&#x27;re talking about.

I believe, though, that people are shaped by their genes to some extent.  It is not the whole of the person but there is an effect.  Why does this matter?  Well, over time I think family functioning evolves to maximize member success based on predispositions.  What does that mean?  Well, I think of my brother in laws family.  They are a quiet reserved people who are very religious.  My brother in law is not religious but he fills that deep psychological need in other ways. They know how to deal with each other and give each other advice and guidance that works for them. My family, on the other hand, is loud and gregarious and we need to be busy all of the time.  We have our own mechanisms for support and success that work very well for us.  They are not very mutually compatible. If we swapped children there would be considerable friction and they would not be as successful as they would be in their native habitat. Is some of this behavior learned?  Of course.  Is some of it genetic?  Definitely.  Is either family &#x27;better&#x27; or &#x27;superior&#x27;?  No.  Just different. As things stand now our respective families build on our strengths.  This type of diversity is important for our species.<p>I certainly applaud people who choose to adopt as I think this is a great way to pass on &#x27;family intelligence&#x27;.<p>I think overpopulation is a solvable problem and not nearly the size of issue it is made out to be.  I certainly don&#x27;t want people with a demonstrated successful approach to life to eschew bringing their brand of life into the world and nurturing it.  People as a whole are not going to stop breeding and the only way to solve the problems that overpopulation brings along with our other problems are capable human minds.<p>The caste system is overly rigid to be useful.  It is disgusting, I agree, because it wastes human potential.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that what a person learns from their family and heritage is not important, just not <i>all</i> important.  There is a big distinction there.<p>And I do thing that knowledge and technology are important.  But not <i>all</i> important.  Again, there is a big distinction.<p>And I never said children are everyone&#x27;s &#x27;greatest accomplishment&#x27;.  That&#x27;s silly.  I am saying that focusing on the now and chasing ephemeral success and ignoring what will last beyond one&#x27;s own short life might be a short term winner but a long term loser.  Jonas Salk&#x27;s children might not cure any global diseases but what about their children?  What about their children&#x27;s children?  What about 500 years from now?  Can you say that some predisposition that is passed on from Salk&#x27;s genes or familial values will not influence his progeny to make the world an even better place?  Direct impact is deeply important but it can&#x27;t exist without existence. Where do you think the Jonas Salks of this world come from?<p>You seem to think that having children keeps people from making an impact.  It absolutely does not.  It is a false dichotomy.  That is what I am trying to get across.  It is like working 18 hours a day to get something done -- in the short term you might accomplish your goal, but how many times is getting something done in a month that you could&#x27;ve done in three really going to make a huge difference when considering the long term price you pay?  Do you know what is even more rare than doers?  People who do for the long term because that means thinking about the long term.  All too rare.  And the lack of that perspective means that people who do think for the long term are discounted.  Having kids?  Oh jeez, now that person is useless.  Its a poisonous idea that affects far more than the person spending their life like it was a stolen credit card.",1431441898

That, and the fact most news is depressing garbage as nutritional for your brain as sweetener is for your gut, is why I only skim the news these days.<p>Most journalists / writers are decent people aiming to communicate as much as they can, as clearly as they can, with overly tight time-frames and (less so online) limited news-holes.<p>They won&#x27;t write &quot;may be X&quot; if they can write &quot;is X&quot; - therefore, &quot;may be&quot; (and related modifiers like could, perhaps, up to, close to etc) mean &quot;not definitely&quot; and are usually safe to ignore.<p>They won&#x27;t paraphrase someone if they have a direct quote just as specific - therefore, any general comments have been created to attempt to fit what someone said into the narrative angle of the piece. They may be inaccurate (and few things frustrate me more than the outragists of the world turning a newspaper story into somebody&#x27;s direct quotes).<p>If the headline / lede seems outrageously unfair and Occams Razor suggests there must be more to the story, then there will usually be additional information in paragraph 5 that makes the story less outrageous and more normal. Genuinely shocking stories (whistle-blowing, massacres, genocide) don&#x27;t need to lead with the outrage. Genuine stories also stick around for days with new information or different angles - therefore it&#x27;s safe to conclude outrageous headlines are burying the mundane facts and can be ignored, until they show up many days in a row.<p>Obviously these are generalizations, they don&#x27;t account for truly terrible writing like the <i>Daily Mail</i>, gossip magazines, and current affairs television, and anyone who reads enough news with a critical eye probably comes to the same conclusions (ie, nothing special about me). What this awareness gives you of course is the ability to unwind a complex narrative out from a simple story.<p>So don&#x27;t &quot;Beware Simple Stories&quot; - rather, develop your own expertise in interpreting them.",1431441324

From what I recall people were saying, &quot;Why isn&#x27;t this catalog a webpage yet?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if buying a bunch of little buttons and plastering them all over my house is necessarily convenient. Convenience is largely counter-intuitive. For example, you&#x27;d think everyone would get their groceries delivered at this point, but most of us drive to the grocery store. There&#x27;s a larger convenience in having all these products at your fingertips, trying different brands, shopping for lower priced items, seeking deals, etc. You lose this flexibility with the Dash. Its also really ugly to have what look like ads plastered all over your home.<p>I&#x27;m surprised we all don&#x27;t have a home robot with enough computer vision and fuzzy logic to figure out what we&#x27;re low on and produce a list of items that need to be bought that week. I feel like some kind of robot revolution that was supposed to happen never did, so we&#x27;re finding weird automation solutions that don&#x27;t really work.

These breweries were in larger towns and they cooperated with farmers in a tightly nit ecosystem:<p>grain from farmers -> make beer -> spent grain back to farmers to feed cattle<p>I fail to believe that &quot;competition&quot; was a problem because the infrastructure required to distribute beer far enough to kill the competition did not exist. Yes, perhaps the brewery and bar were owned by the same person and they didn&#x27;t allow the competition&#x27;s beer, but there were no laws stopping the other brewery from opening their own bar.<p>And the fact is that today every brewpub I&#x27;ve ever been to has guest taps and beer from other breweries. I&#x27;ve never been somewhere that refuses to sell anything but their own.<p>The real problem today is that thanks to the three-tier system being completely controlled by MillerCoors/InBev it is VERY difficult to get your new product into bars and stores. The documentary Beer Wars[2] covers this very well -- better than I could in this posting.<p>tl;dr three-tier may have served a purpose 75 years ago, but it has been holding back competition and hurting consumers for at least 50 years.<p>(At one point large towns also had their own local mayonnaise, too!)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/number-of-breweries/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/number-of-brew...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326194/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326194/</a>",1431439942

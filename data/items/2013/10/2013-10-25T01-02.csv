Wordpress has democratized creating a site and helped millions of people create an online business, community, blog, helping bring in massive amounts of revenue for small business owners.<p>I&#x27;ve got 4 sites running wordpress: my portfolio, my online store, a design database for items under $50, and a magazine cutout marketplace. (See my profile for links) Those last two I mentioned took less than a week to tweak and hack together thanks to the speed and ease of setting up wordpress sites.<p>It&#x27;s sad that Matt Mullenweg never got the same recognition that Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg got.

Meritocracy is pretty much Ayn Rand&#x27;s ideal society: the truly talented, superior people rise to the top and dominate the lesser. This is an uber-capitalist notion: the ubermensch pretty much can&#x27;t be nice to inferiors, because that opens the door for cronyism, nepotism, etc.<p>By contrast, communism would be the ultimate expression of sharing, cooperation, etc. but it ignores people&#x27;s skill in the distribution of value. The old maxim, &quot;from each according to ability, to each according to need&quot; means that someone who is paralyzed and (would have) massive medical bills receives free treatment, food, etc. to stay alive. Obviously this comes from more &quot;skilled&quot; people - doctors - who in a meritocracy would instead extract the maximum value from their skills.",1382666251

6609319,comment,6606056,6606950,1,0,nlawalker,,,"I love the idea of device docks and I would very much like to see things go that way.<p>I think docks have some hurdles to jump in the consumer market, though. They&#x27;re unsexy - I think most people associate them with boring enterprise computers and boring enterprise work, and they tend to be big and ugly. They&#x27;re expensive too, considering that most people view them as nothing but plastic with a few connectors and wires inside.<p>If someone can figure out how to jump those hurdles, though, and make docks sexy to the consumer market, beige-box sales will plummet. Make them smaller, easier, cheaper. Make them less proprietary - at the very least, a Company XYZ consumer dock should be compatible with all/most of of Company XYZ&#x27;s portable offerings. Make them wireless and automatic (OK, I realize this conflicts with &quot;cheaper&quot;)! Let me drop my Win8 tablet on my desk and immediately have it display to my dual monitors and let me use it with my mouse, keyboard, printer, big external drive and wired network connection. Let me press a button and have it display to my TV or play to my big speakers. Have your cake and eat it too.<p>I mention Win8 specifically because the whole idea of it is that it&#x27;s a tablet and a desktop OS in one. Why on earth is there no Microsoft-produced drop-in docking solution for the Surface so it can actually <i>be both</i>?! The consumer potential is crazy - got a crusty old desktop PC laying around? Toss it, keep the peripherals, buy a Surface+dock and you&#x27;ve got a new tablet/laptop <i>and</i> desktop. You can &quot;dock&quot; a Surface as-is with two cables (a micro HDMI and a USB hub with all your desktop peripherals wired in), but that leaves out wired network (maybe important), certain peripherals like speakers (maybe important), and power (critical), and even two cables is two too many.<p>Most people who say they need a PC don&#x27;t need a beige box, they need a keyboard, mouse and monitors on a desk where they can work. The form factor of the box that the CPU, disk and memory come in doesn&#x27;t matter when you&#x27;re at the desk, so it might as well take the form of something you can take with you and use when you&#x27;re not at the desk: a laptop, tablet or phone.",1382666131

Musk had a very hard time releasing the Roadster, and it was one of the most painfully delayed automotive launches in history. They were close to running out of money numerous times in the launch, and needed key loans and cash at key times (including a huge cash infusion from Musk himself) otherwise they would have failed. At least some of that based on the public information at the time can be attributed to Musk&#x27;s inexperience in the car world.<p>They made it, but it wasn&#x27;t without a lot of luck. I worry about decisions like this because if there&#x27;s one thing Tesla really needs to execute on, it&#x27;s getting new car models out the door in a very timely fashion.<p>Another example - Nardelli was also a brilliant leader at Home Depot, but he couldn&#x27;t do enough to save Chrysler.<p>The car industry is a very different beast then building wheel chairs and segways.

There are some points that we want to reinforce in order to make sure members understand how this product works:<p>- You have to opt-in and install Intro before you see LinkedIn profiles in any email.
- Usernames, passwords, OAuth tokens, and email contents are not permanently stored anywhere inside LinkedIn data centers. Instead, these are stored on your iPhone.
- Once you install Intro, a new Mail account is created on your iPhone. Only the email in this new Intro Mail account goes via LinkedIn; other Mail accounts are not affected in any way.
- All communication from the Mail app to the LinkedIn Intro servers is fully encrypted. Likewise, all communication from the LinkedIn Intro servers to your email provider (e.g. Gmail or Yahoo! Mail) is fully encrypted.
- Your emails are only accessed when the Mail app is retrieving emails from your email provider. LinkedIn servers automatically look up the &quot;From&quot; email address, so that Intro can then be inserted into the email.",1382665317

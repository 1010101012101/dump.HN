In an era before the internet, you probably wouldn't have been published; if you had been, you probably wouldn't have sold enough copies to make any significant amount of money.<p>If you're not doing the research for the love, and you're not doing it as your job, and no one is paying you to do new research after being impressed by your old research, and it's not engaging enough to draw a consistent audience, you're completely right. It's hard to get compensated for it.<p>Blaming the web for that seems backwards; for the first time the average person has a shot at even distributing their original research and thought. It's <i>better</i> than before. We just need to figure out the best structure for compensating people. Since that's already happening in the realm of music and TV online, I'm hopeful we'll find some solution for thoughtful writing as well.<p>PS: Link to your online writings?",1263315575

It came as advice from my lawyer after having been involved peripherally a few years ago, as a witness, in one IAD case.<p>I grew up around law enforcement (best friend's father was FBI, and current friends in Secret Service etc.).  Also, in Fed-land (e.g. Northern Virginia) where nearly everyone's family is in some form of government/legal service, I suspect the public/police interactions are atypical.<p>As a result, talking to cops in both personal and professional contexts isn't a novel experience.

I confess, the editorializing was done with <i>mens rea</i> in order to help capture the flavor of the dispute. <i>Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea magna culpa.</i><p>On a more serious note, this case does highlight the tremendous dilemma faced by companies that invest large marketing dollars in a distinctive mark and brand only to see it suddenly subjected to ridicule in the public's mind. The real risk for North Face is not so much the direct competitive threat as it is the risk that future customers will no longer be able think of ""north face"" without immediately associating it with ""south butt."" Parody is a highly compelling way of grabbing our imagination and, if this type of association sticks, it will very likely do great damage to the mark.<p>At the same time, when a company files suit over the issue, this clearly exacerbates the risk highlighted above. Lawsuits are no longer a localized matter. When they are filed today, they clearly carry the risk of garnering a lot of publicity if their subject matter is otherwise such as to grab people's fancy, and this one certainly does by dint of its subject matter alone.<p>This must have been a tough one for North Face, and they probably had no choice but to sue to deal with it, in spite of the risks of enhancing the potentially bad association of its mark with the parody. It is a classic case of ""no-win"" for them.<p>On a final, unrelated note, law (whatever its notoriously humorless aspects) does serve as a gathering place for all the foibles of the human condition and whatever humor may derive from it lies largely in the subject matter of the disputes over which people choose to fight. I remember once, while clerking for the federal court, a notorious lawsuit that stretched for years over a guy who claimed that an airline owed him millions because it allegedly lost his rare dime in transit. Along such lines, the ""south butt"" case is one for the case books.",1263315311

Even though I think literal strings are a terrible way to accomplish metaprogramming, a set of API calls for introspection is not what I would consider metaprogramming, since they will almost always be accomplished through runtime calls and do not actually generate any other code that can be further manipulated.<p>Reflection as it is defined in that passage is more of what I am talking about, yes. But I think most languages lack this, including JavaScript. Some good examples are Lisp, Template Haskell, and the macro tools available in OCaml. I have nothing against runtime features, but I do not really consider it metaprogramming if that is the only way to accomplish it, since you are effectively being locked out of a true meta-circular system as a programmer.

It gives you a disposable email that forwards to your inbox. It's free, it never expires, so it is possible to never ever give out your real email to another website again.<p>In addition we track the disposable emails that get deleted by users, and we ask each user to generate a new email for every new website. That way we can track the websites that spam.<p>Anytime the word ""malicious"" and fighting come up in the same sentence, i get a little worried. Our goal is to give the user complete control over their inbox, the problem with having a few gmail, hotmail, whatever accounts is that if you sign up for a few semi-important things (like HN!!) if you delete the email you delete your ""forgot password"" functionality. Also if you give your web address to someone and they choose to sell it, you have no way of tracking it, or stopping the additional spam sources. I'm trying to fix that with my service.<p>While it might not be for everyone, its extremely useful to me...so i'll keep improving it and making it a service I want to use.

And as with any other matter that is hammered into my head from every corner, I personally like to gain a certain level of comfort regarding its veracity.<p>Since you seem to be aware of the ""extensive proof and documentation"" regarding this subject, I would be very grateful to see citations in literature so I can study them.<p>(This is quite helpful since I <i>can not</i> raise this ""scientific"" topic in polite society without suffering adverse social and possibly economic consequences)<p>The subjects that perplex me the most are:<p>1 - logistics:  A handful of sites were used to kill people and dispose of bodies.  (4 years of 12 hour days non-stop seems to indicate something around 30 people per hour non-stop.)  How long does it take to reduce a human body to ashes?  How much fuel does it take to do this?  What sort of maintenance do these machines require?  (I suppose the local crematorium can provide some factual numbers in this regard.)<p>2 - methodology:  What chemicals were used to kill.  How fast acting are these chemicals?  How can these chemicals be delivered?  How dangerous are they to the operators of the killing factory?  What effects do they have on the factory infrastructure (corrosion, discoloration, etc.)?<p>3 - disposal:  Assuming .2 cubic feet of ash per human body (rough guess), there should be somewhere near 1,000,000 cubic feet of human ashes around the slaughterhouses.  Have they been found?<p>From what I understand, every critical scientific effort to date to investigate the above has had serious consequences for their investigators, including incarceration for some.  (No doubt I will get my virtual share of the same as well.)  In contrast, I am certain that beyond ridicule, the consequences of questioning the existence of Electron, and DNA are fairly minimal.",1263312850

This reminds me more of the ATM technician who overreacted to someone taking a photograph with their phone of the machine being refilled. The man was temporarily arrested and had his phone confiscated, and was treated very rudely, when in actual fact, technical schematics are available online from the ATM's manufacturer.<p>It's just people being power-hungry, that's all. I understand that police are concerned about their own privacy and safety, but the major reasoning behind much of the Bill of Rights was to prevent the police (and government in general) from feeling comfortable stepping outside their bounds. People in both situations claimed the cops were being overly violent - so what evidence could anyone bring against the police now?",1263312808

And that's what most attempt to accomplish.<p>In a nutshell: The scanner looks for known files (thus you see a lot of 404's). If it finds these files, it may try another check (some query string or POST) to determine if it is the vulnerable version. The scanner then tries to inject some javascript for the XSS. If it sees the injected string in the body of the response, it may start modifiying the request until the javascript is actually valid, resulting in an alert window. If it doesn't see a response weith the injected code, the test is complete, move to the next. Finally, the scanner may look for backup files by taking the list of pages from the crawled site and appending things like .bak, .orig, etc.<p>If you were to take this scanner and run it against a site that returns status code 200 for every request, and echo's back the query string, I suspect you will see a more extensive list of checks that are performed.",1263312760

1047756,comment,1047186,1047639,0,0,Rod,,,"<i>""What's wrong with them preaching that their values are better?""</i><p>Suppose that you invite people to your house. Rules of etiquette say that the guests should not tell you how to live your life. Nobody likes to be told what to do, nor how to live. Except for Muslims in the Balkans, most Muslims in Europe are guests. Guests should keep their mouths shut until asked for their opinion.<p>The Muslims I know who have adapted really well to Europe are the ones who adopt the attitude: these people do not know what Islam is, they think Islam is suicide bombers... so, as an ambassador of my religion, I will tell them what Islam is, without trying to force my belief system on them, so that they get a clearer picture of the enormous complexity and diversity of the Islamic world. By contrast, the morons who claim that it's OK to kill a cartoonist, and who claim that Muslims are victims, are the ones who give a bad image of Islam.<p><i>""I frankly believe here in the U.S. we do a better job of assimilating people because we do not subscribe to ""adapt to our customs, or move back to where you came from."" We demand the freedom to believe whatever we want, as long as we grant others the same privilege.""</i><p>I live in the U.S. now and I disagree. The U.S. is a country of immigrants, and one of the unwritten requirements to live in the American society is that you conform to the norm. You don't need to lose your culture, but you need to mellow it down in your public life. Sorry, but the U.S. being as tolerant as you claim is a nice dream, imho.<p><i>""Ironically, even with the U.S. wars in Muslim countries still ongoing, I still believe that Muslims are better integrated into U.S. society than they are in Europe.""</i><p>I agree, but not for the reasons you gave. Europe has millenia of history. In Europe, nationality and ethnicity are too deeply connected. Though I am from Western Europe and lived in Denmark, I don't think I would ever feel Danish even if I lived there for 50 years. Being a U.S. citizen is much more cultural than ethnical. The U.S. is more welcoming to all immigrants because of this, not only to Muslims, but to everyone. And it has more to do with the ethnical aspect than with freedom of worship. Do you really think that Muslims in Europe have no freedom of worship?",1263312411

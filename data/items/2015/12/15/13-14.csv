I only know what I&#x27;ve seen, and I&#x27;ve seen the internet slowly crumble. NAT ruined the power to publish freely[3], and advertising became a perverse incentive working against actual journalism and creativity.<p>On the other hand, you seem unable to acknowledge that advertising is only one type of funding model, and you seem very naive regarding the actual costs that model exacts on society.<p>Explore more of the internet, and think of creative ways to approach the question of funding. If you are observant, you may notice that there are quite a few successful creative endeavors that exist outside of the world of advertising.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10730416"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10730416</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html#balkan"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/surveillance/2015/video-2015.html...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/</a>",1450187838

Anyway, one of the biggest flaws in your theory is how humanity will ween off oil, given the growth of renewables/electric cars. Oil is a finite resource. If there is a non-zero need for it, people will consume it and dip into this finite pool. As the pool depletes, prices will increase. So currently, what is oil used for, and do we expect to use oil in the future?<p>There are numerous critical uses for oil. Oil derivatives are used to fertilize most of the food on the planet. Oil derivatives used to make almost all clothes sold today. Oil derivatives are used to make tires, shampoo, paint, soap, toothpaste, rubber, glasses, and 10s of thousands of other products. Many industrial solvents, essential for 20th century goods, are oil derivatives <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical</a> .

There are just so many uses for oil. Oil is <i>critical</i> for modern American life. Many experts expect oil based products to be used by humanity for the next thousand years.<p>Unless there is a drastic change in how oil is produced, petroleum will be consumed until all cost-effective reserves are depleted. The assumption the world <i>&quot;will only pull up half of what it already has in reserves&quot;</i>(!!) is naive.",1450187795

The reason for type inference in Lisps is generally for optimization, where knowing that an array is of type X lets you compile X-specific code for functions that take arrays of type X, and to allow efficient memory layout, where your array is made up of contiguous X objects, rather than storing an array of pointers to X objects, and all the cache missing and so on that this causes (as well as overhead of allocating space for the pointers).  Just for completeness, I am saying that in the absence of type information, arrays are always actually arrays of pointers.<p>So lists are always made up of cons cells which contain pointers, so one optimization is out regardless (it is possible that primative types like int or float would be packed into the cons cell itself, but most implementations would achieve this by some kind of bit tagging rather than type information being &#x27;known&#x27;).  The other optimization is out because it would likely be equivalent to do dispatch via the usual method for untyped objects rather than trying to do somehow use the type information.",1450187683

Mostly plugins are the root of all evil there.<p>The same (plugins) probably applies to ownCloud, still that doesn&#x27;t make it better. I personally think that embracing PHP&#x27;s low entry barrier [1] is the wrong approach and I&#x27;d rather see a security-driven design.<p>> This is wrong. Until now there has not been a single moment where customers did receive patches in advance. The only difference being is that they see the advisories earlier, but at this moment patches are already available for all.<p>Thanks for the clarification - very sorry for the FUD. I got this info at a conference from one of your enterprise customers not-so-technical management guys, who is apparently misinformed.<p>> For the record we receiced until now 340 reports by over 150 individuals and until now only 1 vulnerability within the server has been pointed out. (Full Path Disclosure of the ownCloud root folder such as &quot;/var/www&quot;)<p>My argument was that the market price of vulnerability is more or less a metric for security strength [2], and 500 USD doesn&#x27;t seem to be much. If we presume that the value of a critical ownCloud exploit exceeds 500 USD, your bounty program provides very little incentive to search for or report critical vulnerabilities and you&#x27;d only get low-quality reports (which seems to be the case).<p>> What makes you thinl they are more secure?<p>I think that ownCloud has a big problem with automated vulnerability scanning and the security properties of managed appliances are generally superior. I unfortunately can&#x27;t edit my original post anymore, but I should have added that running ownCloud behind a VPN is a very good idea as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://owncloud.org/blog/owncloud-and-php/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://owncloud.org/blog/owncloud-and-php/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/attachments/542-Boehme2005_22C3_VulnerabilityMarkets.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/attachments/542...</a>",1450187110

Ideally it will have a capital structure (typically a C-corp) that facilitates substantial capital investment and a well proven mechanism for capturing value in those rare cases where it occurs. Most new businesses are not startups in this sense. That&#x27;s a good thing because few startups in the Silicon Valley sense succeed.<p>&quot;Startup founder&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;entrepreneur&quot;. There&#x27;s really no age at which a person should wait to become entrepreneurial. Running a startup in the Silicon Valley sense, as you note, is effectively bounded by the minimum legal age of majority. Practically speaking everyone matures at different rates. There are fifteen year old children who are more mature than fifty year old adults.<p>My advice: trust your gut. Remember that taking investment is not business success.

It&#x27;s about being able to audit the history, instead of using history as a kind of documentation of the intent of the changes:<p><pre><code>    Git features the &quot;rebase&quot; command which can be used to\n    change the sequence of check-ins in the repository. \n    Rebase can be used to &quot;clean up&quot; a complex sequence of\n    check-ins to make their intent easier for others to\n    understand. This is important if you view the history of \n    a project as part of the documentation for the project.\n\n    Fossil takes an opposing view. Fossil views history as\n    sacrosanct and stubbornly refuses to change it. Fossil\n    allows mistakes to be corrected (for example, check-in\n    comments can be revised, and check-ins can be moved onto \n    new branches even after the check-in has occurred) but\n    the correction is an addition to the repository and the\n    original actions are preserved and displayed alongside\n    the corrections, thus preserving an historically\n    accurate audit trail. This is analogous to an accounting \n    practice of marking through an incorrect entry in a\n    ledger and writing a correction beside it.\n\n    To put it another way, Git remembers what you should\n    have done whereas Fossil remembers what you actually\n    did.\n\n    The lack of a &quot;rebase&quot; command and the inability to\n    rewrite history is considered a feature of Fossil, not\n    an omission or bug.</code></pre>",1450185543

Statins are probably among God&#x27;s greatest gifts to most people with high LDL as clinical trials show, but many in the HN community might be willing and able to make drastic lifestyle changes that other individuals are incapable of. Many entrepreneurial and data-driven types have the thick headedness to be that 1% of patients for whom lifestyle changes work, or at least we like to think so. In any case, starting a statin (in the case below) and then proving to oneself that one is supreme commander of diet and metabolism may be the optimal route. The issue lies in which pathway to choose for our attempt at supreme commandership--ketogenic, paleo, low trans fat, etc. Once again, the results are unclear in some trials and the mechanisms are as elusive as ever, which is why we reflexively search for explanations in the fey realms of inflammation, microbiome, epigenetics, and so forth. Addendum: Most clinical trials are aimed at helping the general population with a specific condition; it would be interesting to try clinical trials of diets in only highly educated and fairly affluent people who know python (usually not part of the subgroup analysis).",1450185446

The point here is that even where the frontend interfaces with the backend it is still in the frontend&#x27;s domain.

Well, if you let a kid age out of middle/high school without growing up, you get &quot;wah wah My friends like me, how dare the world not make me rich&quot;.  This fits the old nerd trope where you come back into town with your freshly minted degree and very high paycheck and run into the coolest kids from high school, still there, pumpin gas and flippin burgers and cashiering at the grocery store, they were kids, they were the cool kids, we grew up and are now rich and cool, but they&#x27;re still cool kids making change at the cash register for a living, presumably for the rest of their lives.<p>The, uh, low developmental age of the folks in the article shows in the video topics.  They are perfectly appropriate for a 13 year old to impress other 13 year olds and make a happy little echo chamber of little kids.  Thats more or less non-monetizable, exactly as what most 13 year old kids do outside YT videos, therefore unsurprisingly she&#x27;s deep in poverty and being a little kid at heart she&#x27;s not going to have the bootstraps to pull herself up with.<p>The pity of it is they&#x27;re so darn close, so close to actually making it.  I am not talking about being even more clickbaity or shoveling just one more advertisement.  Take for example the self described lesbian stoner waitress in the first paragraph.  You can&#x27;t monetize her &quot;how to win the breakup&quot; video no matter how stylish the presentation or the personal magnetism of the presenter or how experienced the presenter is or how great her first impression is.  But she could make at least small stacks of cash if she leveraged her real job, being a waitress.  Women who&#x27;ve never waitressed before (still working on their liberal arts degree, etc) wonder how to do the job and what its like, she can release some fun training-ish vids.  Everyone loves to laugh, do some problem customer videos.  The secret inside story of being a waitress.  Re-enact the worst (in a funny sense) pickup lines she&#x27;s had to tolerate (or not tolerate, or maybe the lines that actually worked LOL).  How to beat the waitress interview and get hired.  Small talk for people who don&#x27;t like small talk but want a job.  Rather than daydreaming of getting millions, she might actually get hundreds or even thousands.  It would certainly be an easier sell for a professional salesperson than &quot;I am pretty, and I ate brunch today&quot;",1450184985

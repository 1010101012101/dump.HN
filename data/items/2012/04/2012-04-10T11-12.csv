Problems are limited in time and range. They most likely won't bring your app down.
- You have universal data structure, ordered dictionary with lots of functions that operate on it and some additional features for numeric keys.
- you have php.net/name_of_the_function which gives you description of the function and it's parameters, return values with comments and examples of use from the users.
- getting things sent by browser is extremely easy, sending stuff to browser is even easier.
- if you want to do something, functions that will help you are there because someone needed that before you and just added them there. And it's not in some obscure package that you have to download from God knows where. It's in the core and it's most likely only one of it.<p>You can dissect a rat and complain how ugly it is but it will still eat your lunch.<p>All the elegance of other languages are not that important.

Yes, it has flaws, but PHP is associated with spaghetti code 100% of the time regardless of who's writing the code. I've seen some very well structured PHP; Yes, it does exist.<p>I'll admit that I am new to web app development and learned how to program(web apps) with PHP. The simplicity and forgiving environment is what made it so alluring. Sure my first bits of code may have been sloppy, but that sense of false confidence pushed me to learn more and improve my understanding. I gained experience and ""real"" confidence quickly. After seeing how easy it was to make simple apps with authentication features and whatnot, I moved onto Python. PHP quickly taught me the basics which then allowed me to jump into more advanced features and other languages, and that is why I appreciate it.<p>Before anyone uses my words against me where I mentioned a sense of false confidence, I think that's actually a positive thing. It pushes the user to learn more, or at least it did for me.

Sinclair continued their tradition of crappy keyboards with that as well, and by then that was a deal-breaker for a large part of the market. Their machines were - together with the Oric 1 - often derisively referred to as ""doorstops"" even in the press, even though the Oric had a slightly better keyboard.<p>By the time the Spectrum+ came out, they (and Oric...) had fixed that mistake and it was clear what a difference it could be: The new model outsold the old 48K model (which was identical apart from the case) 2:1.<p>But the Spectrum+ had atrocious failure rates (the Spectrum had failure rates of 5%-6% - there are reports of failure rates of 30% for the Spectrum+). As a result I don't think I even ever saw one of them. Many dealers internationally never carried them.<p>When the Spectrum 128 came out, it was too late. I remember my friends and I were impressed with it - it was great ""for a Spectrum"", but by then ""everyone"" had already picked camps, and Spectrum was largely dead in the water outside of the UK and Ireland. Not even the subsequent +2 and +3 after Amstrad acquired the Spectrum could make up for that - by then the C64 was too cemented as the dominant 8-bit machine pretty much everywhere but the US and UK, only the UK of which the Spectrum had an established presence of note.<p>Commodore on their hand made their second attempt at a crappy keyboard with the Commodore MAX Machine (Ultimax/VC-10) in 1982, as a cost cutting measure.<p>That's what I was referring to by repeating mistakes - the MAX Machine was quickly cancelled after poor sales.<p>Commodore knew better, but tried again anyway, but because they always had a ton of different projects and different models, and different models were released in different markets, they saw the failure in Japan, and never invested much in getting it sold elsewhere, and cancelled it quickly to focus on the C-64. So unlike Sinclair, a failing model (or three) didn't affect them all that much - they had other models that sold well in most markets.<p>There's a long range of variations of the C16/C264/Plus4 range, for example, that were pretty much ignored by many Commodore subsidiaries, because they saw them underperform in other markets and didn't really want them.<p>Sinclair on the other hand didn't have better alternatives until it was too late to get a bigger international foothold.",1334057809

I'm going to contrast Google and Facebook to explain why I think Facebook is overvalued.<p>When Google was in it's fast growth phase, it could perhaps justify a P/E like what Facebook has now - because of the way in which Google makes money. For roughly 1 out of every 14 Google searches, a user clicks a Google ad. As the amount of people on the internet grows, that means the amount of searches grow, meaning the number of ad clicks grows in tandem. Even today, with all the smartphones and tablets and people from the BRICS coming online, Google only has a P/E of 21[1].<p>Now contrast that with the way in which Facebook makes money. Targeted ads. The revenue they generate doesn't grow in tandem with Facebook's userbase. Granted, the revenue goes up as companies chase the eyeballs, but it seems to be a mixed bag of results selling ads on Facebook, so some companies aren't going to get the results they want and will quit Facebook. People there don't go there primarily to look at products (completely different to many Google searches). And of course some companies will get great results, but the overall point is that there isn't a direct correlation between user growth and revenue growth.<p>Ah!, you say, but there are other ways for Facebook to make money (off the top of my head):<p>a) Premium celebrity pages (pay Facebook for a prominent page to get fans)<p>b) Somehow charge for user accounts, maybe for premium features<p>c) Selling user data to third parties<p>d) Zynga etc. profit sharing<p>e) Others<p>Maybe they could make some revenue from premium celebrity pages, but not enough to justify a 3-figure P/E, IMO. Charging for premium features would be highly controversial, if they did this it would be a sign of desperation and a complete departure from where they began. They probably will do some form of c at some stage (don't worry, your data is completely anonymised!) but users would probably abandon ship to competitors in droves if they did. They will continue to make money from social gaming, but it's fickle and short-lived, plus Zynga is trying to wean themselves off Facebook to grow their own revenue.<p>Overall I think they will continue to make billions from ad impressions and social gaming profit sharing, but nowhere near enough to justify a $100bn valuation IMHO. If they bow to Wall Street pressure and really try to squeeze their userbase data for every dime (you could call this 'doing a MySpace', i.e. shooting themselves in the foot), people will leave in droves to the next social hotspot. So it will be 'interesting' to see how they will justify the lofty valuation over the coming years.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOG</a>",1334056413

3821625,comment,3817180,3817180,1,0,epdotnet,,,"Thanks to sheff for mentioning my non-profit experienced-people.net forum which discusses website purchases and sales. This site has sent us a fair bit of traffic yesterday :-)<p>Flippa is one of the many avenues one can use to sell a site or find one to buy. It has a high profile but in dollar terms accounts for a small proportion of online businesses sold. However, it's a popular location for webmasters and lower end websites and I recommend the flipfilter.com site for stats on the Flippa marketplace.<p>My own analysis is somewhat different. As I commented in the sparklewise blog (the OP link), figures you see in Flippa are deceptive. The $200K site mentioned at (D) in his blog post was sold a month later by the same seller for $40K. The chances are the first sale didn't go through. That's not an isolated case. I would advise that readers exercise caution, it's easy to get carried away with the large figures :)<p>I've been doing my own analysis of some Flippa stats  (<a href=""http://experienced-people.net/forums/showthread.php/6331"" rel=""nofollow"">http://experienced-people.net/forums/showthread.php/6331</a>) and the numbers are just not adding up for me.",1334056003

At this point, I assume all services worth using have some free version or demo, and maybe a paid premium version, if it's going to cost anything.  If something isn't good enough that I'd want to actually use it, I won't use it regardless if it's free or not.  If it's worth using, I'll gladly pay a reasonable amount of money, or at least gladly rock the free version until I need to upgrade.  As long as it's free enough to see if I want it, that's all that matters to me.",1334055924

I think mine is about 8Mbit, but I doubt I'd notice if it dropped to 1Mbit.<p>I'm not arguing for the cap. I'm just confused that you think a 1Mbit connection is somehow comically slow?",1334055797
3821617,comment,3818046,3818046,1,0,ak39,,,"Great article, but does it answer the question it raised:  Why has software evolution lagged behind?<p>Also, is the focus on parallel computing the only litmus to judge this as the downfall of every imperative programming language?<p>To answer the first question, we have to abandon our technical computing hats in favour of the philosopher's hat.<p>What went wrong with the promise of reusable objects?  Whatever happened to 4GL?  Why are frameworks confined to isolated corners of language evolution, far-removed from the domain problems faced by end-users?<p>Why, oh is every nerd developing an Order-Entry system from scratch?  Why are nerds doing the same code again and again for decades in every conceivable new language (now FP).<p>You see, if we start accepting structural restrictions like those imposed by FP, then philosophically we should follow that <i>maxim</i> to its logical conclusion.  Restrict to the point where we do not harm ourselves (by repeating).<p>Rant over.  ;-)",1334055733

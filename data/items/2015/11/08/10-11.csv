To me object oriented programming as served by C++/Java/C# is good and fine for building abstractions over existing systems.<p>System design however, is served much better by thinking the system in terms of fundamental data structures, graphs and relational models rather than as an obtuse object hierarchy of some sort. This is my main gripe with GoF - it&#x27;s used as a some sort of toolbox for software design when actually it just explains how to convert familiar and non-seremonial idioms from other languages to C++&#x27;s verbosity. If the student is not exposed to software construction in these other languages and just to GoF he/she is missing on so much (I know I did, at least).<p>But this is just my personal preference, maybe someone else writes much better software when thinking in objects but for me my initial years as a programmer were basically wasted in trying to build beautiful object hierarchies out of everything.<p>I write mostly C++ as my day job. Software modules which are built by embracing the C++ object model to it&#x27;s full extent are the most horrible stuff I have to deal with  :)",1446980327

10528161,comment,10527428,10527910,0,0,mbrock,,,"I think they also don&#x27;t understand monads because they have confused notions about the kind of concept &quot;monad&quot; is on the meta level. Their criteria for understanding and their methods of learning are unsuitable for becoming competent with the use of algebraic concepts. They are trying to think their way to a type of &quot;intuition&quot; that simply is not possible, kind of like trying to learn to ride a bike by &quot;understanding&quot; bikes, comparing bikes to various other things, or spamming the internet with complaints about how bikes are strange and difficult. (What&#x27;s the problem with just taking the bus?!)<p>If Haskell&#x27;s &quot;Monad&quot; type class were instead called &quot;AbstractComputationFactory&quot; or some other such intimidating technobabble, then when someone looks up what is the superclass of IO they might just think &quot;oh, that&#x27;s some weird detail, whatever, I might learn about that later.&quot; Since instead the name &quot;Monad&quot; is vaguely funny and appealing, people want to master that concept in principle before they even get &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to run in GHCi.<p>Of course people are free to focus on whatever they want, and we can talk about the possibility of improving the pedagogical aspects of Haskell, and probably university teachers have interesting things to say about that.<p>But there is no magic way to explain an algebraic concept that will suddenly make it intuitive and easy. If people want to understand them, they&#x27;ll have to study. If people want to use them without understanding them on the conceptual level, that is eminently possible.<p>I myself don&#x27;t understand monads and I&#x27;ve been using Haskell since 2005. I&#x27;m just not good at abstract algebra (flunked that class) and PDFs terrify me. However, even though if a mathematician asked me to explain monads I would be embarrassed, I can still use them and even define my own. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve tinkered with them and acquired a know-how feel for the structure and what they are good for and how the patterns work—which is exactly how I&#x27;ve learned every other concept in programming.<p>Since most concepts in programming are ad-hoc, informal, and specified by hand waving, there is not even a possibility of understanding them at the level of mathematical rigor.

It&#x27;s not. While the restored sight is absolutely better than having cataracts and will indeed cheer you up in the immediate term, the vision provided by the replacement lenses is a far cry from a person&#x27;s natural vision, for one thing these lenses have a fixed focus. Another issue is the limited life span - eventually they fur up, but don&#x27;t go hard like UV induced cataracts - which necessitates replacement or laser surgery.<p>Humans - particularly the kind that live up mountains in Nepal - are adaptable and can cope, but as someone who has had this surgery (and the follow up laser surgery) it annoys me that reportage routinely fails to mention these kinds of things.<p>In this particular case, it is also quite peculiar that the author fails to point out that handing out a $5 pair of sunglasses would prevent the cataracts in the first place (these are pretty much all UV induced). Education and prevention in this respect <i>are</i> very much under reported.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cureblindness/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/cureblindness/</a>",1446978111

Technology centralizes in a <i>geographical</i> sense, since it reduces that barrier, but it also allow for the decentralization by allowing small players to access big markets - for example, tech-aware small farmers around here are actually making a decent income by producing for niches, while before only large players could make anything above subsistence income. At the same time, some of the new behemoths are not quite so - they may operate in many markets, but they&#x27;re often only a small slice of the transaction, and the barrier to entry is not that great. Uber might be large now, but the scale is more from the cash being dumped into it than from the economies of scale, in my opinion. We&#x27;ll see how that plays out in a few years.",1446977942

I suspect this individual doesn't feel animosity towards google, rather he would like to share his thoughts about why he left.  Maybe it's a warning for other people about to join the company or just a way to commiserate with ex-googlers.  Maybe he's showing off.  What kind of person has the luxury to quit a job that legions of fellow coders would scramble for?   Maybe he's advertising himself as a free agent.  These, of course are all speculation.  I don't think he's bashing google at all; I think he's telling them exactly what he thinks they need to hear so someone on-high steers the company in direction more attractive to creative engineers.  But what do I know? Maybe you should ask him.  Then you could write a ""Why do people bash companies when leaving"" blogpost.

People are finally expecting software to run faster while requiring less.  Each version of Android has noticeable speedups on identical hardware.  Snow Leopard freed up 6GB of storage when upgrading from Leopard.  Inefficient software no longer buoys hardware sales.

It won't ruin your day like rm -rf will, but it will give you enough rope to rappel your way down into ontological horror.<p>I have been using it to write extended tutorials on my local system. I may find a bug at step 45 that needs to be fixed back at step 2. I am pretty sure that git was never designed for me to do this, but it can be done pretty safely, in a way that I can recover from.<p>Now, is this method of going back and fixing things in the past a good idea for general software development? Absolutely not! If I wrote a bug in march, it serves the team rather poorly to go back and replace every commit in the master branch with a new one that doesn't have the bug. And that's why I feel it's accurate to call it rewriting - sure, git keeps enough data around for you to recover from any boneheaded edit you may make to a branch, but from the perspective of a teammate you're still going back and modifying history. It's still confusing. You're still creating new commits out of their commits that have the same name, but different contents.",1304834813

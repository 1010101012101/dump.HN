Its compactness and elegance have made it popular with educators, language designers, programmers, implementors, and hobbyists.""<p>Scheme is widely (mostly?) used as a teaching and research language in Comp. Sci. schools.  This sort of environment encourages experimentation with the language itself, whereas Python and Ruby are more oriented towards practitioners who are more interested in using the language as-is, not experimenting with it.",1336327115

For example, you have languages like Larceny which were primarily designed to study Garbage collections or even probabilistic language models using Church Scheme.<p>The ease in which Lisp and Scheme allows you to create new languages and perform exploratory work has spawned a lot of newer implementations.<p>And People also come up with newer implementations for a specific goal in mind.

People asked questions like this when Amazon was transitioning from selling books to selling everything. Lots of people at the time thought it was crazy. Now it's recognized as a brilliant move.<p>Ask yourself, how many other things has Amazon done that seemed a bit out there, but turned out to be brilliant moves? How about competing with Apple with a tablet computer? Also ask yourself, how do these crazy or out-there seeming things fit with an overall vision in retrospect? I think the answer is: amazingly well.<p>My best guess is that Jeff Bezos has a roadmap for the next 5 years and vaguer plans for the next 10 or 15. (I happen to know that Intel had a roadmap out to 15 years in the late 90's, so it's not unheard of in tech to plan on this timescale. Probably a good thing to note for serious investors in the stock market.)<p>EDIT: I've said it before on HN -- Bezos is a player of the game at Steve Job's level.

The interesting thing in most cases is what you build on top of that foundation.<p>With Lisps, the value is in the uniformity. That makes it very easy to extend the basic functionality you get out of the box in a way that fits in, using macros and so on.<p>With various other languages, the value is in the pre-built tools that rest on top of some underlying abstract syntax tree. That covers a vast range of functionality these days: more expressive type systems, a wider range of built-in data structures, actor-based concurrency, low-level memory and port access, and numerous other practically useful language features. Hopefully any given language offers a combination of features that work well together and have natural supporting syntax and semantics. That in turn gives each language its own flavour and means each language works better for some types of software than others, even if ultimately it's usually just syntactic sugar for a relatively simple execution model and an AST.",1336324323

Rather than viewing LISP dialects as fragmented forms of one original language, we can view Common Lisp, Racket, and Clojure---the three main forms of LISP seen in ""the real world""---as three separate languages that, like Python and Ruby, haven't fragmented.  We can view the fact that all three use the LISP model of computation simply as a design choice and not a sign of ""offshootness"", in the same way that we don't say that Python and Ruby are the results of ALGOL's fragmentation.",1336324255

I was a non computer science grad, but i had decent amount of coding experience and algorithm design, but only that. No theory courses in Networking, Operating System or even DBMS. \nI wanted to make web apps, and wanted it hard. So the few things i learnt were:\nyou need to know basic HTML, CSS.\nServer Side Scripting: PHP/Python/Ruby \nClient Side Scripting: Javascript(jQuery is the new JavaScript)\nYou should also know the terms like DNS, CNAME etc. so that you can put your content on a web server to start of with a shared hosting from any provider would be good.<p>But the above will only let you make very basic apps. \nIf you want to make slightly more complex things, there are Content Management Solutions like Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal. (these are amongst the most popular ones, they have readymade plugins so if your only motive is to get a site up and running, they will serve the purpose.)<p>If you want more customization you might have to learn MVC frameworks.

The popular frameworks are \nRuby on Rails\nDjango (Python)\nCodeIgnitor(PHP)\nBackBone (JS)\nMy rule of thumb for deciding is:\nGet a hang of a server side scripting language(PHP/Python/Ruby), choose the framework  in that particular language.<p>Another most important rule that you should keep in mind is:\nAll that you want to do has been done, you need to assemble it your way!!\nLearn to copy, modify and paste to suit your needs. \nDon't be afraid of any implementation it will be out somewhere there. \nThats it, hope it helps.",1336323725

I&#x27;d say about 80% or so of the companies I speak to get rejected immediately just for this reason alone.<p>I&#x27;ve found that this is one of the very best indications that a given company has dysfunctional management, doesn&#x27;t prioritize engineering quality or craftsmanship, views software labor as a cost center of the business instead of a value center, and views programmers as easily replaceable commodity workers.<p>I totally grant that it&#x27;s possible I am passing on some good companies when I do this. But the false negative rate has to be extremely low, since so many other companies with these tools have repeatedly demonstrated themselves to be horribly managed, talent-wasting career killers.

10582333,story,,,5,3,davismwfl,"Ask HN: Credit Card billing practices",,"I just had an interesting experience with Brighthouse Networks, curious if this is a common practice in anyway.<p>We have autopay setup via a visa debit card, I had a new card issued because the bank decided to move to chip cards.  I missed changing a couple of autopays immediately, including brighthouse.  Not a huge deal, soon as I saw it I fixed it and never had any issues.<p>What is weird, is when I got the statement it showed Brighthouse tried the payment 3 times on the same day, first for the total amount due, then for 50% of the total, then for 40% of the total.  In my case they were all denied because I had a new card issued with new details so it wouldn&#x27;t even process.  However, I got to thinking, had this been a situation where someone had a valid credit card or a debit card with just a low balance, then it technically could have created multiple overdraft (or over limit) charges at the bank.  I think this is valid because two smaller payments might get &quot;covered&quot; with the overdraft/over limit fees, but the combined larger amount might be rejected outright.  Hence two $35 or whatever overdraft fees for someone because the company decided to break the payment without first asking the consumer.<p>Is this a standard practice amongst companies?  I have never seen it before, and while it didn&#x27;t hurt me it seems to be a questionable practice.  At the same time, I can partially see a benefit of a company doing this, for anyone that had a rough month it might keep their services on with the smaller payment until they get the rest of the funds together.  But it just seems wrong the company does it without asking the consumer first.",1447779307

It&#x27;s not just nullable types (and also I believe the Nullable arrays in DF are tuned for performance with linear algebra operations, which may not be true for general Nullable arrays). You can get to the features in other ways, but it&#x27;s easiest to use DataFrames and the documentation is written for DF&#x27;s. However I think the documentation, scope of functionality for DataFrames, etc is not complete enough for me to quickly use it day-to-day. So I basically just put everything back into arrays and do a couple of custom functions to get my work done.

If this core idea is not there, that is logically equivalent to not subscribing to the religion (whoever wants to change whatever at wherever renders <i>any</i> belief fundamentally void, let alone what one believes to be God&#x27;s guidance). But the jurisprudential framework (&#x27;usul al-fiqh&#x27;) encompasses the principles to formulate specific course of action according to the immutable legislative guideline (formulated from authentic texts) in the specific circumstances. An example, harming oneself is prohibited in the text, so smoking has the ruling of being impermissible as its harms are largely known now while earlier academics used to deem it disliked based on another textual principle.\nIn short, there are constants and there are variables; without any constants, it all becomes tendentious whimsy.<p>The ideas related to the roles, responsibilities and  respectability of the individuals are different in the Islamic creed. Yes, a woman gets half from her father (her husband owes her, legally), and she is exempt from the basic responsibility to become the breadwinner. Any Muslim is meant to respect and care for his/her mother more than the father. Historically many Muslim women were scholars (<a href=""https://archive.org/download/AlMuhaddithat/al%20-%20Muhaddithat.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/download/AlMuhaddithat/al%20-%20Muhaddit...</a>) and rich (in the old Muslim heritage, many of the large endowments for public welfare are known to be from women).

In a situation where a project is open for market-rate bidding, you believe that only people looking to profit should bid. To do otherwise is more than rude, it hurts someone trying to make rent. I don&#x27;t agree, for several reasons.<p>First, I think that because the goal here is a public good. As a result, civic engagement in the form of volunteerism is something to be welcomed and encouraged. Volunteerism in public good production is a net win, as it frees up resources for other uses where volunteer labor is not available. This could easily include paying contractors to write Open Source software, leading to a net increase in the production of Open Source software. The goal is a maximum of production of public goods, not a maximum of employment of people to produce public goods.<p>Second, I do not think you like where this logic leads if applied with your caveats. By your logic, you should object to any non-profit performing service that are also performed by for-profit entities in the event that the former undercuts the latter for service recipients. Your logic requires you to object to free clinics, MSF, and food pantries. All participate in markets as volunteers where others are attempting to participate as for-profit actors. Do you think MSF is rude and inconsiderate?<p>Third, I do not think you have considered the practical implications of your proposal. How do you propose 18F determine which projects should be market-rate-only and which should be volunteer-only? Do you think there&#x27;s reasonable any way of doing this that produces ideal or near-ideal outputs? I do not. Such a distinction is at best arbitrary.<p>To review, I understand your position. You hold that volunteers should not undercut for-profit contractors in market bidding scenarios. I disagree. The product here is a public good, and we wish to maximize production of public goods for a given cost. Further, any logic that requires you to object to MSF should be reconsidered. Finally, I hold your proposed alternative to be unworkable.",1447779084

That really is largely a process that can best be described as cherry-picking. How do we decide what to cherry-pick?<p>I think the evidence is clearly on the side of the secular argument that humans are social animals, therefore we need to exist (mostly) peacefully in groups, which gives rise to &quot;moral&quot; principles like not screwing with your neighbor least he screws with you back.<p>Scripture is really just an adaptation of these principles in the form of stories and allegories.

From what we can tell password strength meters mostly work, or at least work &quot;well enough.&quot; Some users attempt to game the system and in doing so wind up with marginally more secure passwords.<p>We also found 2F easier to implement than even we expected. Google Authenticator uses something called &quot;Time-based One-time Password Algorithm&quot; or TOTP for short. Even ignoring all the open source code and libraries, it actually isn&#x27;t really at all complicated to do yourself. The hardest part is generating the QR codes for Google Authenticator (which, yes, we did utilise a library for). Even the storage requirements are low.<p>Our current passwords rules are:<p>- Minimum 6 characters<p>- Maximum 256 characters (for DDoS protection reasons, long passwords cause a high CPU load on our micro-instances)<p>- We technically allow a &quot;weak&quot; password but bring up a pop-up (strongly discourage it).<p>- We do have password expiration (90 days) and history (3x) due to unavoidable organisational requirements<p>But overall we&#x27;re pretty liberal. You can use sentence based passwords and typically they&#x27;re marked as &quot;secure&quot; in the traffic light score system.<p>> Forget about the now famous XKCD strip that proves a long lowercase password is more secure than a short dollar-sign-riddled password.<p>Technically what it proves is that you can replace one character in a complex password with one word in a sentence based password and get similar (or better) levels of security, even if the attacker knows you utilise sentence based passwords.<p>For example, a En-US keyboard has approx. 100 characters on it. A child&#x27;s dictionary has about 10,000 words in it. But in reality less than 1/2 of those keys are ever typed, and less than 1/16 of those words regularly used (plus you have predictable words like &quot;The&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;And&quot; etc which have less security value).<p>So a good rule of thumb is: If you move from random character passwords to sentence based passwords, keep the letters in the former the same as the words in the latter (e.g. 6x characters = 6x words, 8x characters = 8x words, etc).<p>This gives you the best chance of remaining either as secure or MORE secure while moving to lower case sentence based passwords.",1447778706

It points out that choosing 4 words at random from the 2048 most common words provides more entropy than choosing one word at random from the most common 65536 words and performing some letter substitutions on it. In both cases, it is assumed the attacker knows the formula used to create the password.<p>If your formula for creating a password is &quot;Choose a printable ASCII character at random, then repeat&quot;, you only need a password that is 7 characters long to beat the &quot;4 random common words&quot; formula (95^7 > 2048^4).

I was on a team once where we used FogBugz (without any of the metric tracking nonsense -- our managers didn&#x27;t even log in to it, they just talked to us when they needed to know about progress) for a long time without any issue, and only after some big middle management restructuring did we switch to JIRA, specifically because managers wanted a tool that spit out useless junk about velocity and burndown. We even had to go and do really dumb training about &quot;story points&quot; and how to enter the progress data they wanted (which added so much overhead to entering things into the system that most of us just stopped, or at least cut every possible corner so as to not waste our time doing manual data entry for the sake of middle management).<p>Not every such tool focuses on these kind of pointless metrics so much. Using the GitHub issue tracker is joyful, especially when you don&#x27;t have someone trying to micromanage you with it. Some tools focus instead on what the actual developers need to get their work done, instead of what managers want in order to be more micromanagerial.<p>Another tool that is starting to go down the dark path of JIRA is Asana, which is a shame because the original design of Asana was great. But now it&#x27;s all about Scrum metric bullshit, catered to middle managers who have the power to choose it over other things, and usually don&#x27;t make the choice based on developer preferences or rational arguments.<p>I&#x27;d say the title could be &quot;Agile/Scrum metric trackers are a symptom of a management problem&quot; and that JIRA is absolutely the poster child for such a tool, so it&#x27;s not bad faith to tie it directly to JIRA.

10582202,comment,10575450,10581592,0,0,paulmd,,,"Actually, leaving the rendezvous radar active was the checklisted procedure.  Remember that in the event of an aborted landing they would be needing the rendezvous radar right away to try and find the CSM, so the idea was to have it powered up and locked on.<p>The problem was that the computer that guided the radar antenna controlled the orientation by phase angle.  Everything was running on 28V AC, but the computer and the radar mount were on separate AC feeds.  The documentation specified that the supplies needed to be frequency-locked, but failed to specify the need for being <i>phase</i>-locked as well.<p>So basically the two systems could be at any phase angle relative to each other.  In this case, when they flipped the switch they were really out of phase and the computer was commanding traverses that were entirely out of range.  The invalid angle caused the radar antenna to continuously issue interrupts.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the system basically works like an open-loop system.  That would mask the fault, since usually the radar would just lose some of its field-of-view around the edges but work fine in the center.  Or that usually it would just cause the antenna to slew a bit off-target at first before the control loop guided it back, but this time it was so far out of range the antenna wouldn&#x27;t even accept it.<p>It&#x27;s probably a good thing they didn&#x27;t need to abort, because with such a fault I doubt the rendezvous radar would have functioned properly.  Even if they knew about the design problem (I don&#x27;t think they did?) they probably would have a hard time power-cycling it.  There is no &quot;off&quot; setting for that switch, only SLEW (on) and AUTO (computer controlled).  During an abort I would imagine that AUTO would have the computer keep the radar online, so they would have had to use the DSKY to have the computer turn it off and back on.  Who knows what effect that might have on an active abort program.<p>Source (good read): <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/07/no-a-checklist-error-did-not-almost-derail-the-first-moon-landing/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/07/no-a-checklist-error-...</a><p>Yes, the executive was a great piece of engineering and definitely saved the mission.

And only when and if you&#x27;ve identified root causes can you go and attack the problem.<p>Attacking Iraq on false pretexts after 9/11 was a step on the way to Liberating Fallujah (or should that be &#x27;wiping it off the face of the earth&#x27;) which indirectly led to the US leaving Iraq which led to a power vacuum which led to on the raid of Mosul by IS which was one step on the way to IS becoming more coherent which was one step on the way to a bunch of murderers shooting up the Paris nightlife.<p>It&#x27;s not that hard.

A magical function which somehow returned an incrementing counter value for each unique chunk of data you fed to it, globally, would fit the definition of a cryptographic hash.<p>Real-world cryptographic hash functions, however, just try to approximate a random oracle. They attempt to achieve pre-image resistance and collision resistance by making their output look random. Certainly that&#x27;s the case with SHA-224, which is what this code uses.<p>Some real-world CSPRNGs do just use hash functions directly. Linux&#x27;s /dev/random implementation, for example, just returns a SHA-1 hash of its entropy pool contents. Yarrow (used in Mac OS X, iOS, and FreeBSD) does a final pass on its output using a block cipher, but requires that the hash function used in its earlier stages produce random-looking output. Fortuna is similar.<p>Of course, this code is insecure and should not be used in production, regardless of the internal details, simply because all of the inputs are known to a third party i.e. Twitter.",1447777087

I keep an account there because like many people, it&#x27;s a fairly effective way to coordinate with friends and family without creating long email chains or massive group texts.<p>Not everyone is trying to be a social butterfly, resigning themselves to quantity over quality or neglecting sleep and hobbies.

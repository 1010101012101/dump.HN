It's simple solution that's jam packed with features to ensure that it's effective and complete, yet not annoying.  The system provides full bidirectional security.  Public launch is 3/21.<p>We are sharing a booth at CES with YC funded Wakemate.  Please come visit us at Booth #35117 if you are at CES.<p>We are having a special promotion where we give a phone halo out once a week to one lucky person who tweets about #phonehalo.<p>Please give us your feedback and we ask for your support.<p>-Chris Herbert

Or maybe they're both hooked up to a geiger counter. I admit it seems pretty unlikely that anybody would wire a robot or person up to flip a switch at exactly the same time a lightbulb comes on, but it only seems unlikely because of our pre-existing knowledge about robots and lightbulbs. If we take away that knowledge and simply make it a statement about how variable A changes when variable B does, it's much harder to infer which way, if either, the causal link goes.<p>(I suppose if you really wanted to be paranoid you could suppose that your _own_ actions in flipping the lightswitch might be subconsciously being controlled by someone else, but this is a whole different level of skepticism)",1262935375

But there's a lot of middle ground between a complete jumble and complete unity. I don't think anyone is suggesting that there are no regularities at all, just that the ones that there are may be relatively local and particular. (They're still pretty damn impressive for all that, though.)<p>I think this is an aesthetic problem in a way. Everyone seems to have a kind of Platonic aesthetic these days -- everything has to be ultimately simple and unified and abstractly beautiful. If you'll excuse a stupid metaphor, it's sort of a question of how you visualize God's office. Does it just have a plain desk with a couple of pens and two equations written neatly on a notepad, or is it a huge jumble of dusty books and papers covering every conceivable topic at every conceivable level of analysis? I think part of the reason for my ""conversion"" to the dappled view of things was that I started to find the Platonic aesthetic less and less appealing. (Of course, it might be a <i>really bad idea</i> to let aesthetic considerations have this much influence, but maybe that's another topic.)<p>>It amuses me more than a little that this particular concept is being pushed by someone neatly straddling the disciplines of philosophy and physics though, isn't that in itself something of a defense of a broader view?<p>I think it's a bad kind of slippery slope argument to go from ""there are some interesting connections between some things"" (certainly true) to ""everything is deeply connected and unified"" (plausible, appealing in some ways, but not something a rational person has to believe).",1262935147

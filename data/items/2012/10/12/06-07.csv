The messy details of proper facilities management get old real quick. But, as you say, the math just doesn't work.<p>With existing companies you end up paying huge premiums to rent virtual instances on heavily shared hardware. You're giving up a proper network (with internal and external connections) and persistent high performance disk I/O. It's just not a great deal.<p>I'm trying to get it much closer to the pricing of doing it yourself, while keeping the convenience of not having to actually do it all yourself.<p>Would love to get some feedback from you, if you're willing.

Linux becomes the OS that can't reboot itself.<p>Untrue. Read the LF article linked from this. After the user interaction screen, the key of the second bootloader can be installed on the machine. After that the system can boot directly without user intervention, even with Secure Boot fully enabled.<p><a href=""http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2012/10/linux-foundation-uefi-secure-boot-system-open-source"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2012/...</a><p>> the pre-bootloader will also check to see if the platform is booting in Setup Mode and if it is, will ask the user for permission to install the signature of loader.efi into the authorized signatures database.  If the user gives permission, the signature will be installed and loader.efi will then boot up without any present user tests on all subsequent occasions even after the platform is placed back into secure boot mode.",1350025150

You could not have a disk partitioned for both DOS/Win and BSD. The BSD folks didn't think that was important--if you really wanted to dual boot, get a second disk.<p>Linux could dual boot with DOS/Win on one disk, so I used Linux.<p>Second encounter: BSD did not support IDE CD-ROMs. When asked when they would be supported, BSD folks said IDE was not good enough for workstations and servers--get a SCSI CD-ROM.<p>The problem with this was that SCSI CD-ROM drives were around $400. IDE CD-ROM drives were under $100. If you were going to make heavy use of the drive, that $300 difference might be justified. Most people were NOT going to make heavy use of the drive--it would be used to install the OS and then sit unused until it was time to install the next version of the OS.<p>Linux would install from my IDE CD-ROM drive, so I used Linux.<p>By the time BSD got to the point that it could coexist well with DOS/Win, and didn't have ridiculous hardware requirements, Linux was sufficiently mature and established that there just wasn't much point.",1350024917

One way of dealing with this is, the GC keeps a set of all the address ranges that belong to its objects (these are the only objects that could be garbage collected). Then, when it sees what could be a pointer, it'll first look up whether this ""maybe pointer"" actually belongs to it's address range, and only if it does will it add it to the mark stack for further scanning. In terms of how does it know when to stop looking for references, actually, the GC will know the object size for any objects that it has allocated, so it knows when to stop scanning it's own object.

This is a reasonable assumption because accessing pointers that are not word-aligned is <i>extremely</i> slow on most architectures. It does not care how fields that don't contain pointers are aligned because their contents are irrelevant (so this translates to the compiler being able to pack some fields together without worrying about breaking the GC).<p>So, a conservative GC will simply scan over every word in an object and interpret it as a potential pointer, regardless of what it actually is.

Engineers dedicated to coding should fix bugs they themselves created, because it means they know the source code better than anyone, and will be able to do so with minimal effort and minimal side-effects.<p>Saying it's a waste of their talent made me puke a little. Coding <i>is</i> fixing bugs. It's a big part of development, and often takes the hardest work or most thinking. You can't just start throwing code around and expect someone else to come around and fix your bugs for you. That's ridiculous and will probably result in a culture where new bugs are created faster because there's no responsibility.<p>> ""You have to analyse the vulnerabilities of these apps and understand attacks, at a very fast speed. We don't have that time anymore.""<p>If you're coding a web app and you're (calling yourself) a topnotch engineer, you should understand the basics of web app security, and how to avoid the top attack vectors such as XSS, SQL injection, XSRF, etc...

Saying it'd be a waste of talent just doesn't make sense, because if you have any talent in coding, then you know about these, and you know how to code the app without creating them.

Sine some years now, I am using OpenBSD for all my personal stuff. My desktop and my server. I will never go back to any Linux Distribution as OpenBSD is so much cleaner, consistent, easier to use and better documented than any other distribution out there. There are two problems with OpenBSD. At first the hardware support. I choose my machines carefully so that OpenBSD is supported which is not that easy sometimes. The second problem is the JVM. At my work place, everything runs on Linux servers with Oracle JVMs so I have to use that.

This isn't really a ""No True Scotsman"" argument because both are headed up by reputable development shops (Sensio and Zend).\nBoth use namespaces.<p>> I don't care for fashion, so ""behind the times"" is neither here nor there, however a Java like OO model is definitely worse on most axes except foot-shooting and style-uniformity for large teams. If I want strong typing I want a system that leverages its power such as Haskell, not something like Java where compilation errors are mostly trivial things and I still end up with null pointers all over the place which is exactly the same as the most common type of error in more powerful dynamic languages. Beyond that, saying PHP OO is like Java is doing PHP a huge service because Java started out as OO with quite a strong vision. It may not have been perfect, and it's certainly developed its warts over time, but the seed of conceptual integrity in Java's OO is an order of magnitude more robust than PHP's.<p>Err, what? I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding you here -- because PHP didn't have OO designs early on somehow that makes it's OO model less robust then Java's? I'm not going to bother arguing that point, but it certainly doesn't make me a less efficient developer. PHP's OO model is more than adequate for most web applications. I'm also not following the null pointer issue. Proper unit testing should vet null value issues out whether you're using a dynamic language or not. PHP has the (arguable) advantage of not completely shutting down when this mistake occurs.<p>> I was specifically making a comparison between PHP and Ruby. Making a one-side claim is a nonsensical response.<p>Not anymore of a one-sided claim than your own.

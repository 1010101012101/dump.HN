Would be more entertaining, and since the way they're doing it doesn't matter, what the hell?<p>I don't say SQL queries out loud, and trying to do so would probably screw me up; I don't know about you, but I don't sit down to write stuff and get it perfect every time.  I often start writing a query, go back and adjust something, start working on another part, tweak this or that, and then finish.  You can't do that when you're forced to say something over the phone. And I don't solve problems I've never come across by just starting to code on my own and see where it gets me; especially when it sounds like the kind of problem that someone else out there, probably smarter than me, has already solved. AND I wouldn't want to hire anyone who took that approach.  Sometimes, it's fun to reinvent the wheel, especially when you're trying to learn things, but I wouldn't want my developers sitting around all day reinventing everything.<p>If you really want these people to do these things, plop them down in front of a computer, give them a time limit of x minutes, leave the room and come back and see where they are.  This relieves the pressure of you standing over them watching them, gives them time and space to work the problem out, and is much closer to how they'll eventually be working...unless you work at some freaky place where the boss stands over your shoulder and watches you type all day long, in which case I feel sorry for you.",1249663940

747921,comment,747531,747601,0,0,jmillikin,,,"Rather than depending on an external document for the protocol semantics, depend on standard transport semantics and information embedded in data returned from the server.<p>REST is, of course, modeled on the Web, which uses (X)HTML for its resources and HTTP as a transport. Web pages do not come with a separate document describing where forms should be submitted to or where a particular page is located -- this information is contained within the page itself.<p>The problem is that this is completely opposed to the ""standard"" RPC model, in which the URLs and methods to use are specified by an external document. Further complicating the use of REST is that many developers (such as the author of the article) are using second- or third-hand knowledge of what REST is and how to implement it. This sort of cargo-cult mentality leads to bizarre concepts such as a ""RESTful URL"".<p>REST is somewhat vague -- the phrase ""like how the web works now"" doesn't contain enough information to properly implement. For this reason, one popular way to describe it is in terms of what it is <i>not</i>. After eliminating the protocol models which are not REST, what is left is REST.<p>For example, one popular RPC model is to POST documents describing actions to a well-known URL, such as ""/rpc/call"". A possible exchange:<p><pre><code>    POST /rpc/call\n    <method name=""get-time""/>\n\n    200 <result status=""ok""><time>2009-05-06T07:08:09Z</time></result>\n\n    POST /rpc/call\n    <method name=""set-time""><time>2009-10-11T07:08:09Z</time></method>\n\n    200 <result status=""no-such-method""/>\n</code></pre>\nNotice that HTTP is not relevant at all to this exchange -- the URL is always the same, the status code is always the same (200, success) and the details of the exchange are contained entirely in the request bodies. This is the model used by protocol frameworks like SOAP.<p>Many people looked at that and said: ""this is silly! nothing is properly cached, and we can't re-use existing HTTP libraries for error handling"". This the advent of (typically ad-hoc) RPC protocols over HTTP. This seems to be the most popular model for web applications, currently. An example of such a protocol is the Twitter API: every method is described in an external document, and client applications hard-code the URLs to various method names. These RPC-over-HTTP protocols are sometimes called ""REST"", due in large part to the cargo-cult mentality mentioned earlier, but do not provide any of the benefits of a true REST API.<p>A third category I'll call pseudo-REST, because apps designed to use it are based on REST with a few exceptions (typically authentication). Many web applications (ironically, News.YC isn't) are pseudo-REST -- for example, to add a comment, there might be the following form:<p><pre><code>    <form method=""post"" action=""/new-comment"">\n    <input type=""text"" name=""name""/>\n    <textarea name=""text"" rows=""8"" cols=""80""/>\n    </form>\n</code></pre>\nIn REST terms, this describes the HTTP method, URL, and expected parameters of a request to create a new comment. Almost all information needed for a successful request is contained within the page itself. The ""almost"" is why this is ""pseudo"" REST -- web applications typically use cookie-based authentication, because the user experience is much improved over HTTP auth.<p>Finally, we get to a REST protocol. These are just like pseudo-REST, except that the user is authenticated on every request rather than just once. A ""fully"" RESTful protocol is typically seen in APIs.",1249663545

747919,comment,747434,747476,0,0,ZenzerNet,,,"Most bags is ""lost"" (delayed is the proper term) when the incoming aircraft is delayed, for any reason, and the remaining time is too short to unload it, sort it, (screen it), deliver it to the connecting flight in time. The connecting aircraft normally won't wait, unless there's substansial amount of bagggage. Delays cost moneyt. Baggage handlers have to prioritize by the number of bags that will ""make it"". Ofcourse, staffing levels etc. plays a big part in this.<p>The delayed ('lost') baggage is then moved to an area where it will be retagged for a later connection - this could be a direct flight to the destination, or be routed via up to (normally) two other airports, depending on the availability of flights. Sometimes it'll have to wait for the next day.<p>Normally, the baggage tag is registered with a ""now onboard"" message in a worldwide system called Worldtracer, which essentially is a huge Oracle database in Atlanta, with a rudimentary terminal input.

A company can't change to suit every employee.  Working for a startup like Youtube is high pressure.  You have to be very self-aware and able to work under extreme circumstances. When your app crashes and millions of people are angry, you <i>have</i> to fix it!   You can't create a special case scenario for your employees because they need to work in a stress free environment.<p>Of course that is a simple case, but high stress engagements occur at some point in almost every environment and how the candidate reacts to the high stress is very important, perhaps the most important.<p>IMO, it is more important for the employee to adapt to the environment than for the environment to adapt to the employee.  Every candidate is going to want questions asked a different way.  Every candidate is going to want their cube to be a different color -- that's why they are all gray or beige.<p>My point is, if you want A players on your team, you will be well served to waste as little time as possible on candidates that want you to ask them interview questions the way the candidate wants them asked and focus your attention on candidates that correctly answer the questions how the <i>interviewer</i> wants to ask them.",1249663451

I used MySQL for years, long ago, and never wrote a join.  Then ORMs came along and handle joins automatically, so I've still never written one.  So not being able to do it without looking it up doesn't really tell you anything.  I've written far, far more complex things than an SQL join statement.  A more pertinent issue I'd be checking for is whether user input is properly escaped to prevent SQL injection -- again, not an issue with ORMs, but an issue when building SQL query strings by hand.<p>1) A lot of people use languages where recursion is unusual (i.e. NOT Lisp).  Even a senior developer (especially of something like PHP) might not recall this, not having actually written a recursive function for years.<p>3) Representing a car as an object: A lot of software people don't know hardware, so the confounding part might be recalling various attributes of cars and how they relate to each other.<p>Also keep in mind that many introverted people get very uncomfortable when someone is waiting on them.

Facebook will go away.  The iPhone will go away.  These are fads.<p>What people who think like I do often fail to understand, is that most of the world doesn't think like we do.  They want money. They want popularity.  Even if it is fleeting.<p>My question is: Where is the balance? Think about investing. If you have a 20 year vision and invest in those companies, you have to have 20 years of patience.  Plus, how do you <i>know</i> your vision of 20 years out is the correct one?  How do you know how much vision you have?  If you consistently think 5 years ahead of the masses, then buy companies that the masses will think are awesome in 5 years.<p>If you are 3 months ahead or one year ahead, then buy those kinds of companies.<p>It's the same with building applications.  You are building applications ahead of time for a market that will want them by the time you are finished building it. For example, if you build a facebook app and that app is going to take 5 years to complete, well... facebook may be gone by then and you are wasting your time.<p>So what you are stuck with then, is building applications that don't take very long or are targetted toward a massive population with lots of investment and horsepower behind the app that can be built very quickly.  Of course companies that can execute like this can make money building apps for one platform after another making money off the network effects within that platform.  It's not just facebook, it's salesforce, quickbase, microsoft, java, oracle, php, the list really is endless...<p>So, to summarize, how do we determine how much vision we have?  How do we determine how long it will take to build an app? How do we determine when the platform on which we build our apps will cease to exist -- if ever?",1249661899

If a person spent 10% of income on medicine, but 30% on gambling or taxes, it is unfair to attribute the bankruptcy to medical spending.<p>The control group would be needed to measure whether medical costs are correlated with increased bankruptcy.<p>Incidentally, total bankruptcies went down (in absolute number). Medical bankruptcies (by her definition) roughly stayed the same in absolute number. This is most of the explanation for the increased proportion of medical bankruptcies.",1249661468

When they quote a cost of living for ""Baltimore"", do they average over all parts, even the ones where no one wants to live unless you really are using all your cash for drugs and can't afford the hundred bucks a month it would cost you extra to live one block away from the drug dealers??

To be ""equally well off,"" there are a lot more factors than living in an equally-sized apartment with an identical car ... after all, living in a place that doesn't suck counts for something.  As does not needing that car.  Or having an immense amount of stuff to do (much of which is free or close) that keeps you out of that apartment.<p>On a personal level as a NYC resident, I live in a nice apartment in a nice (though not ritzy) neighborhood for $600/month, my transportation costs are $100/month and everything else is just about the same as it would be elsewhere.

The reason such a question is asked is because it <i>isn't</i> something that we do everyday and how we solve problems that we don't immediately know how to solve is what sets good programmers apart from bad programmers.<p>I find anyone who immediately blames the environment for their lack of ability to answer the questions correctly to be suspect. These types of <i>complainers</i> are externally motivated and will never accept fault for their lack of capabilities.  ""You should have asked me in a different way.""  or ""I need to be taught differently"" or ""There's too much pressure""... look, you can come up with whatever excuses you want, but the fact is, you can't solve the problem and what we are looking for is someone who can solve problems.<p>Case closed.",1249661090

They hire someone, they pay them to write the code or build the project and it turns out it's all a lot of garbage and the company is out the money.<p>This problem is really tainting our industry.

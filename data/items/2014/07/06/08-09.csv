The stoppage time is misleading, because additional play time is not a stopwatch or a <i>timer</i>. It is merely a suggestion and while most judges adhere to it, there are some games where additional play time is exceeded. It&#x27;s not strict as a stopwatch implies.<p>* Ball possession: While being an interesting statistics, they are usually shown only once during an entire game. This kind of stuff is now easily retrievable during the game on a tablet or smartphone (&quot;second screen&quot;). Some people find the statistics completely unnecessary, because the only relevant statistic is goals, which is always shown anyways. I also don&#x27;t see how extensive animation in the interface is not distracting.<p>* Formation screen: Just a different flavor.

Hmm.  From the above it seems to be user generated though, but interesting.  There&#x27;s a juxtaposition here that I wonder if the OP could exploit between good reviews (hotels, restaurants) and the sort of livability/walk ability ideas that some of the other posters have mentioned.<p>Love the design, look and simplicity of the app though  very nice.",1404633916

Fill a tire with packed sand, and you have a very good brick, making a wall that has excellent properties wrt heat (either keeping it in, or out).<p>You can also use regular bottles for construction[2]: you need to cut them in two, and fit them together, and layer them into clay/concrete/etc -- and you have again a wall that lets in light, and has good isolation properties (due to the air pockets in the empty bottles).<p>I recommend watching &quot;Garbage Warrior&quot; for more on real-world sustainable eco-housing:<p><a href=""http://www.garbagewarrior.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garbagewarrior.com/</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://earthship.com/Designs/simple-survival"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earthship.com/Designs/simple-survival</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_wall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_wall</a>",1404633792

1180625,story,,,18,12,swombat,"Ask HN: How do you capture and analyse usage patterns on your RIA?",,"Hello everyone,<p>I want to answer the question: ""What is the user activity most likely to lead to the user upgrading?""<p>What are the best practices for capturing potentially large amounts of usage data (e.g., perhaps, capturing every click on every button?), storing it cost-effectively without swamping your main app db, and then running reports/analysis on that data?<p>Is it best to log this stuff to text and then run a parser to load it into a separate db? To use external services (which ones work best? why?) To store it in your main db? Is it best to capture ALL the data and then figure out what you want to extract out of it later? Is that practical/realistic? Is it better to just focus on specific hypotheses and just record those specific data points?<p>I'm particularly interested in these questions in the context of a Rich Internet Application - i.e. something that looks more like a desktop app than like a website. Website analytics are fairly well documented, with plenty of articles tools, etc, but I haven't found much on the topic of doing this kind of tracking for complex RIAs that don't have simple and/or obvious conversion funnels.<p>For example, if you built an application like Huddle, how would you record data to figure out interesting usage patterns and which ones are more likely to lead to a purchase?<p>Thanks for any input/insight!",1268218689

Many people depend on net-connectivity for their income, in the same way that many depend on their driver's license - thus it shouldn't be too easy to cut anyone off.<p>> But can you imagine how jammed up the courts would be if everyone fought it (which they would)?<p>It depends - as long as the amount fined is reasonable, the cost and effort of appealing would stop people in most cases. On the other hand, if the rights-holders would be unreasonable about it, by pushing the fines too far or disregarding fair-use, they'd find themselves in court all the time - which is arguably a good thing.",1268217985

1180601,comment,1180517,1180517,0,0,gizmo,,,"I'd say that for languages such as Python or Javascript tracing JIT compilers are the only viable approach. Because the languages allow anything you can't make any sensible predictions about types and call graphs at compile time (people tried; didn't work well). The incremental-JIT approach (LuaJIT) has less information to work with, and it's not aware which parts of the program are bottlenecks, so it can't intelligently decide which parts parts need optimization most.<p>The tracing JIT is such an obvious tactic that it should be part of any dynamic language. Measure which parts are slow, then optimize those parts using the parameter type information gathered at runtime. Fall back on original code on type mismatch. The implementation is hairy, but it's a no-brainer conceptually speaking.<p>I suspect that dynamic languages will evolve over the next 10 years to allow for really efficient compilers, but for the current languages such as Javascript I doubt we're ever going to see massive performance improvements.",1268217046

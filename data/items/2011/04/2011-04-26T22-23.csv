There are just two models (the previous, and the current. It used to be just one until 2 years ago.), one hardware spec (with varying memory sizes, sure).<p>But that's the game Apple chose to play. They intentionally crippled themselves (even if they don't think so), so this is really a comparison of Apple's strategy vs. Google's strategy. And Google's strategy seems to be winning in some aspects.",1303858756

2487588,story,,,17,23,guynamedloren,"Ask HN: I just wasted 4 years of my life. Now what?",,"Hi HN, this is a long one - grab your popcorn.<p>[Removed some background info due to length, but the gist was that Ive had the entrepreneurial bug for as long as I can remember]<p>I just graduated from the General Engineering program [1] at the University of Illinois in December, and I can tell you that my time spent at UIUC was absolutely horrible.  Year after year, I was told things would get better- These are just weed out classes, dont worry.  Things get better after this.  Year after year, things stayed the same.  In four years, I never felt inspired or motivated.  I tried switching majors, but was strongly advised against it due to a weak job market in the target field (industrial design).  I couldnt drop out or start over, because upwards of $100,000 was on the table for my education. I was surrounded my classmates who didnt give a shit about engineering or learning  their priority was making it through the week so they could get trashed on the weekends.  For a guy who doesnt drink, its difficult to socialize with these kinds of people.  I laid low and pushed forward.  I studied for exams and did homework, but I never felt like I was an engineer.  I always felt like I was just doing busy work and that none of it really mattered. I never felt like I was learning.  Perhaps it was just my program, but you can imagine my distaste for engineering that was built up over the 4 year period.  It was the worst 4 years of my life.<p>Now that Ive graduated, apparently I am supposed to be looking for an engineering job.  But Im not, for two reasons.  The first is that I feel as though I am severely underqualified.  My final GPA is somewhat low (2.9) as the result of taking almost no GPA-boosting gen ed courses, and I have never participated in an engineering internship.  Instead, I spent time helping entrepreneurial family members build their businesses and worked on building businesses of my own.  Ultimately, most of my personal business endeavors failed, but the experience gained was invaluable.  The second reason is that I have a strong distaste for engineering, and could not picture myself being an engineer or working in an engineering-related field.<p>Its not all bad, though.  About 6 weeks before graduating (Dec 10), I had the urge to learn Ruby on Rails.  I have always been computer literate and tech savvy (html + css), but computer science seemed like an elusive, mystical thing.  Programming?  Thats only for really, really smart kids, right?  Wrong.  Turns out its actually pretty easy.  I started reading a few tutorials in late October and things finally clicked in January.  Since then, Ive been programming constantly.  I code for 10-16 hours a day until I get burnt out and fall asleep, then I wake up and do it again.  I love every minute of it.  My desires go beyond being a code monkey for the rest of my life, but for the time being, its wonderful.  I love the startup scene and I could see myself doing this for the next few years.<p>Since January, heres what Ive made:<p>www.letspocket.com  note-taking tool (my first app)<p>www.madebyloren.com  blog engine written from scratch, with admin and comment system<p>www.peak4x4.com  full-featured offroad enthusiast network, with tagging, notifications, etc<p>www.boxify.me  file-sharing tool for groups (quick one-day app while AWS was down)<p>www.snowday2011.com  one-off t-shirt website aka 4-hour profitable startup<p>In addition to the personal projects, I also built an inventory/tracking system for a biomedical waste processing facility, but the project is currently on hold due to founder issues.<p>I am thrilled with how far Ive come over the past few months.  I have I have tons and tons of ideas and I want to bring every one of them to life.  I never thought hat I could build things like these, and here I am busting them out one after another.  Ive been so focused on learning and building since January that Ive almost completely neglected monetizing.  Funds are running so low that I probably wont even be able to make next months rent.  I would love to keep building apps, but it doesnt seem feasible unless something changes (aka get a job or learn to monetize).  So now Im getting desperate.<p>Heres my big dilemma: I am supposed to be seeking a job related to my area of study, but I want absolutely nothing to do with that field.  Ive fallen in love with programming, but I dont feel as though Im qualified enough for paid work.  I have a wide variety of skills (design, UI, html + css + javascript, Ruby on Rails coding), but Im not <i>excellent</i> at any of them.  I am also somewhat unconventional, as I have yet to learn to write good tests or follow TDD, for example.<p>I am not opposed to working for a startup, but who wants to hire the self-taught guy with 6 months programming experience when they can hire the guy with years of experience and a comp sci degree to prove it?
I would enjoy freelance work (programming or design) but there are better programmers and better designers out there. I would also be competing for work with international freelancers who charge next to nothing on sites like freelancer.com.<p>So what do I do?  Do I apply for the engineering job I have a slight chance at getting hired for, but will probably hate?  Do I apply for programming positions that I am underqualified for?  Do I attempt to compete for freelance jobs? I feel like Im stuck.<p>Im pouring my deepest thoughts out to perfect strangers.  I would sincerely appreciate any advice and input you can offer.  Thanks!<p>[1] For those of you who are unfamiliar, the General Engineering program is a cross-breed program where students study core engineering principals, but maintain a focus in another area of study (finance, business administration, etc).  I chose entrepreurship as my focus.",1303858716

How did you define success?<p>If you use an internally defined success to be ""I'm doing what I love"" then it becomes tautologically impossible not to succeed :-). If you define it as ""supports a particular lifestyle I associate with 'successful' people"" then you run the risk giving up on your own happiness to chase an externally defined goal. Many people do this, its why the phrase 'keeping up with the Joneses' is easy to understand.<p>When you talk about how your love of doing something is 'hurting your career' what you are saying is that you won't make as much money as you might otherwise make if you continue doing what you love.<p>Ask yourself if you are OK with that. My thesis is that when you start doing things for their earning potential rather than your personal desire to do them, you run the risk of having a bank full of cash and a bunch of sour memories of the last <i>n</i> years of your life. Worse still, if life throws you a curve ball at the very moment in your life, all the cash in the bank may not be able to get you back to doing what you love. Ever.<p>Its not easy either, it may sound like a bunch of platitudes and aphorisms but understanding what makes you personally happy, distinct from the influences which have tried to define happiness for you throughout your entire life, is a challenging task to take on. For me its the single biggest reason to try new things as you just may find something you love to do that you never realized was so fulfilling before.",1303857855

So by promoting their community manager and bringing back the original CEO as an advisor, it would seem that this would enhance the parts that they're already really good at, but will they be willing to stir things up enough to bump up the revenues (even if it pisses the community off some)?

However, they won't usually gain enough adherents to get enough votes to make it past the ""filter.""

They can't help but evangelize their passion, they would continue doing it even if they had to <i>pay money</i> to do it.<p>When your passion is a loss-leader for you in a personal finance sense, then you could be ready to make it your living.<p>In other words, make what you're living your living. Some people <i>claim</i> to love sitting around watching television, but in actuality they are lulled into it through boredom or exhaustion. If they had more energy, they perhaps wouldn't do 50% of those ""loves"" and do other things.<p>I talk to guys in the workforce who say ""man if I could just make money boatin' n' fishin', boy I'd be set."" No, that's your weekend escape hatch. Get on that boat every day after work if you really want to get paid. See the pain points in the ""want to boat recreationally"" industry/market and then serve it. If you can't do it, then you're just one of those ""weekend warriors"" adrift with a couple sixers whittling time away.<p>That's not a passion, that's not what you love. It's a pastime, like carving wood on the porch or reading romance novels before bedtime. Now, <i>writing</i> a romance novel in any professional capacity (yes even romance novels) takes a dedication that likely 90% of romance novel readers (or any other reading enthusiast who dreams wistfully of writing for a living) have the time, training, dedication, or inclination of doing. Of the remaining 10%, only a handful will have the amount of talent, perseverance, immunity to rejection and ridicule, and plain luck it takes to make a living out of it.<p>If you don't like the odds, odds are you don't like the career. Don't do it. But don't listen to people who say you can't do your passion as a career. I refuse to believe your only choices in life is either be infinitely talented, connected, and lucky or to work for a corporation. There is in-between, and just because there are Zuckerbergs and JK Rowlings out there making everyone else in their field look bad with their embarrassment of successes, not everyone has or even <i>needs</i> that insane gobs of drive and dedication and luck.

A blast is simply a piece of information it could be a photo, an observation, an event, a web link, or anything else you want to share with the people in a location. What makes this a powerful tool are two important components: location and tag.<p>Each blast must be tied to a specific location. Leetto makes it easy to search and find the appropriate location for your blast, or to add a new location to our database. Notice that we didnt say your location. Leetto gives you the freedom to send a blast anywhere on the planet, allowing you to connect with people based on their location, not just yours. This opens up a world of new possibilities for location-based messaging.<p>Each blast must also be given a tag: a short and simple descriptor of what kind of information the blast contains. For example, if youre saying hello to a new location, you could tag your blast Introductions, or if youre advertising a concert, you could tag it Live Music. Tags make it easy to group location-based content by topic, allowing you to browse based on your own interests.<p>The best way to learn about Leetto is to check it out yourself.

2487428,comment,2484986,2487340,1,0,silentOpen,,,"Sorry if what I wrote was unclear.<p>OES_texture_float is a current WebGL extension that is implemented by several browsers. The issue is that OES_texture_float does not specify readPixels support. As far as I can tell, even with native OpenGL ES 2, there is no extension that specifies readPixels functionality for floating point textures. I believe this is a bug in the OES_texture_float specification as binding a texture format to a texture engine is entirely type-level and no types are required after the resource is bound. If there is a hardware limitation, you're doing it wrong.<p>So the current state of support is: some browsers implement OES_texture_float and you can load floating point textures. Some browsers, when you have enabled OES_texture_float, also allow writing floating point textures. Unfortunately, the only thing you can do with a written floating point texture is re-read it in a later vertex (if you can get vertex texture fetch support which is still lacking for WebGL on Windows due to DirectX impedance mismatch) or fragment shader.<p>If you want to read back the results of your float computations, you have to pack them into 4 x 1 byte pixel color channels and then unpack them on the javascript side back into floats. Of course, when converting the GPU native floating point values into color channel integers, implementations ""helpfully"" clamp to [0..1] and then multiply by 255 (!) so that 0 -> 0 and 1 -> 255. This plays havoc with floating point precision as 255 is not exactly representable. Complicating matters further, ES2 and its corresponding GLSL have no provision for integer or bitwise operations and so the implementor is reduced to using floating point operations to pack floating point values into 4 [0..1]-values that then get molested into 4 byte arrays which can then be read back into Javascript which can then waste browser/CPU time rebuilding floating point values from pixel byte channels with accompanying (technologically unnecessary) numeric noise.<p>I've not seen any WebGL implementation running on the iPad and Apple won't say anything about it. If I had to guess, I'd say that WebGL is attractive to Apple in the HTML5 sense but not in protecting their native application advantage. The Steve will probably decree that native 3d apps have superior performance by virtue of not being written in a sloppy, GC'ed language and run in a giant sandbox. I don't think native iOS apps allow float texture read-back, either.<p>The real question is: Is WebGL's lowest-common denominator (phones) approach to 3d a bug or a feature? On the bug side, it's absurd that I can't read float values off of my desktop GPU in 2011. On the feature side, it means that even your iPhone 3G will be able to poorly execute and render a WebGL application at an unbearably low framerate!",1303855947

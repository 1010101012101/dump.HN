978859,story,,,5,10,Tichy,"Ask HN: possible Java contract, what alternatives to suggest?",,"I used to be a Java consultant and my past keeps haunting me. Since I haven't earned money for a while, I did not say no immediately to a recent consulting request. It is a startup by someone I have worked with before (who is a business guy). So far I only talked to his partner, and the project does sound quite nice. Some perks for me would be that there would be a chance to bring one of my best friends on board, and we would be developing the code from scratch together (the two of us). This would give me some additional confidence because he is much more of a Java geek than I am. I haven't coded in Java for over a year now, and it would be nice to work with somebody who is more up to date with the latest developments.<p>But Java is also the problem: I really never wanted to do another Java project again, ever. I had some hopes to suggest Scala instead, but to my surprise my friend was against it. And it is actually reasonable: his argument is that it would cost us time to learn a new language and framework. Actually I have dismissed Scala twice before, too (from rather superficially reading the ""how to get started"" tutorials), but it is the only compromise that I could think of that a die hard Java person might take serious.<p>Also, I have now noticed that there does not seem to be a lot of online documentation about Lift, the Scala web framework. I am also not sure I really like constructs like ""LongKeyedMapper"" - again, a very superficial evaluation, but at first glance it just doesn't look that pretty.<p>Anyway, I am not sure what to do. I think by default the client was thinking Java, but they might not be hard set for it. But what else is there? I am not really good at any other web frameworks yet. I am not 100% happy about Rails (ActiveRecords, Migrations - bleah), and not about Django either (RESTful URLs???). I suppose any alternative would have to be statically typed to convince my Java friend. Also, this startup will do money transactions, so it is more down to earth than fancy, and performance DOES matter.<p>I guess I should just suck it up and do it in Java, as it is ""only"" about 4 months anyway. But I have been <i>extremely</i> unhappy in some previous Java projects. Or just say no to the project after all. It is also probably mostly standard web develepmont, a ka boring. I was hoping that learning a new language along with it could prevent my brain from completely shutting down during the process, but it seems unprofessional to burden the client with the additional risk.<p>Personally my best hope for the near future is JavaScript all the way down (perhaps with node.js), but I don't think I could suggest it to a client just yet. Maybe F# would be an option, too, but I have zero experience with .NET (is it possible to develop and run it on Linux - Mono?)<p>I am aware of Clojure, but I think it would be too big of a leap for my Java friend, and I am not certain that Compojure would be to my liking (don't think I dig the the HTML builder with <i>square</i> brackets, for instance) - yet another superficial evaluation, no less.<p>Perhaps there is some approximation to a fast turnaround Java web framework? I just know that if confronted with another service oriented architecture that requires me to change 10 files just to change one word on a web site I might end up getting writers block and unable to get any work done (Service, ServiceImpl, DAO, DAOImpl, Controller, ControllerImpl, jspx... ok just 7 so far, but I might have forgotten some... ah, perhaps messages.properties, application-context.xml, hm...perhaps a FormObject + Impl?).<p>Maybe I could say no and tell them to find a more dedicated Java developer. If they absolutely can't find anybody, I could suggest a fancy language of my choosing as a compromise and feel less bad about it because at least I would not be guilty of having prevented them from choosing the ""safe"" Java route :-/",1260056979

978821,comment,978515,978591,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Well, since most violins made in the last century or two have been patterned on Strads (including a rather lovely graphite fiddle with an unfortunate marketing problem), it's not entirely surprising that a well-made modern instrument might be mistaken for one. Anyone participating in such a test who can't pick the del Gesú out of the pile ought to visit an audiologist immediately. The character of the Guarneri is as different from a Strad as, say, Ethel Merman is from Maria Callas, and the Guarneri is Merman -- a lot of odd-order harmonics give it a harshness, but damn, you can hear it from a mile away. The Stradivarii are sweeter and rounder, with a much larger proportion of even-order harmonics, but with enough harmonic content to maintain that little bit of stridency that allows it to be played over top of an orchestra.<p>Yes, there has been a lot of research around the acoustic properties of the Cremona fiddles. A LOT. You could fill a dozen or so mid-sized container ships with zipped fiddle papers on high-capacity Micro SD cards. Not surprisingly, sounding like a Strad involves mimicking the mechanics and internal acoustics of a Strad.<p>A competent luthier uses dimension only as a guide to rough the shape; final shaping of the back and deck are done by ear. Tap, scrape, tap, scrape until the violin back as a percussion instrument sounds right. And that ""right"" sound is usually derived from a Strad or a ""gold"" copy of an unfinished Strad kept in the shop for exactly that purpose.<p>The graphite instrument, being made from a material much more consistent, controllable and predictable than natural wood, was patterned using vibrational mode analysis across the entire spectrum of the violin's range. With a stable, predictable material, tooling can reproduce the successful prototype nearly perfectly every time, and a quick trip through a sweep genny for Doppler analysis is all the QA you need. If an instrument's components react acoustically the same way a Strad's do, and those components are assembled the same way as the Strad, then the instrument should sound pretty much the same as a Strad. (The best acoustic research available concerning Stradivarii was done in the production of this graphite fiddle.)<p>Yes, there is a lot of voodoo mumbo-jumbo talk about the magic of the Cremona fiddles. Yes, the wood was different, the spruce being older-growth, harder and with higher mineral content on average than most of what was available elsewhere -- but there was probably more variation from slab to slab of the available spruce and maple than there would have been between the ""average' log in Cremona and the ""average"" log in, say, Paris. Yes, the varnish was different, being part red shellac, presumably in order to give the wood a redder colour than tree resin alone would have. Both of those differences can and MUST be worked around every time the luthier puts gouge and plane to wood. What makes a Strad a Strad is its vibrational modes in minutia.<p>Violins produced before the Cremona variants were ukuleles in comparison. The Cremonese were rather protective of their intellectual property, and had no trouble disseminating faulty intelligence and making a big fuss about keeping things like varnish and glue recipes top secret. Misdirection is a very effective security technique. What they did differently was to try to understand how the instrument really made its music, and then to treat the acoustic (as opposed to merely structural) components as instruments in their own right. Luthiers outside of the Cremona circle were more than willing to believe that there was magic in them there beetle shells -- it's a lot easier to swallow the idea of alchemical tricksies than to accept that someone else is taking more care than you are at every step in the process.<p>Make a fiddle that vibrates the same way, make a fiddle back that plays the same marimba music when rapped in the same way as a Strad back, and it will sound the same as the Strad. Make a fiddle that vibrates like a del Gesú, and it won't sound much like a Strad at all -- but it will sound remarkably like a del Gesú. (Oh, and set the bridge or soundpost wrong on either and you get something that sounds like it's perhaps twenty dollars at Wall*Mart.)",1260054976

978817,comment,978511,978511,0,0,flybrand,,,"VCs are market makers; they facilitate their LPs investing into their portfolio companies.  Brand is applied in two directions; upstream to their LPs (who are upstream of them in the capital supply chain) and to prospective investment opportunities (who are downstream of them in the capital supply chain).<p>From Upstream: Yes, brand matters.  Having good returns is important.  Many LPs also have LPs themselves; being an investor in a good fund makes explaining things that much easier.  The ""Nobody got fired for buying IBM,"" issue exists everywhere in capital supply chains.  Dozens of LPs enjoy casually dropping, ""We invested in Google.""<p>For Downstream: VCs manufacture capital returns for their investors.  They source inputs, private companies, in which they invest, oversee operations, and assist in the creation of exits.  Having a lower cost of private company acquisitions is similar to any manufacturer who has a lower COGs, or an IT group who is able to design and build more efficiently.  So, yes, brand matters there too.<p>In a community that has experience with VCs, brand matters less, just as it matters less in any community that is more focused on results rather than karma.

I get the thrust of the Less Wrong article, though I think that frankly his language and vitriol is direly misplaced.  He's railing against some class of Frequentists who attack Bayesians.  This is sort of a Fox News tactic; pick someone, in this case, a commenter on a blog, and generalize their comment to the entire population.  It's fairly unstatistical, if you ask me.  I don't get why anyone would do this.  A good Frequentist is not a lost idiot, nor does she rail against Bayesians.  In fact, a good Frequentist understands the beauty of Bayesian methods, too.  I'd even wager that a good Bayesian understands why Frequentist methods have dominated the 20th century.<p>I'm attempting to realize that rare event in these vitriolic philosophical academic debates - add a bit of middle-groundness.  In this case, the middle ground of Empirical Bayes has proven to be very, very useful in large-scale simultaneous inference problems.

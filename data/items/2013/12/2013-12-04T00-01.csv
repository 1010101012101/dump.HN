The right used to mean &quot;the government can not prohibit you from doing it&quot; - right to free speech, right to bear arms, right to elect and be elected, right to own property, etc. But these &quot;rights&quot; mean something different entirely - when people say &quot;right to minimal salary&quot; - they do not mean the government should not prohibit you from earning minimal salary. They mean that the government should force your employer to pay you certain amount or fire you. When they say &quot;right to education&quot; they do not mean government can not prevent you from studying. They mean the government should take money from other people and pay for your education (that if they do not support enslaving the educators so that their work for free). When they say &quot;right to housing&quot;, they do not mean the government should not remove you from your own house - they mean the government should take houses from other people or take money from other people and build houses using this money and then let you live there.

These discussions were definitely required as they brought out some important issues with bug bounties today and how security issues should really be dealt with.<p>Prezi, has now both apologised to me and also have offered to pay me for my findings. I have updated my blog post to show this, as well as the emails exchanged between us. I&#x27;m glad that it ended this way - all within the last 12 hours.<p>Initially, I did not redact the developers names, and after the blog post became I had to rush to make sure that I had removed them from all places which were indexed by Google. My intention was not to negatively affect the careers of the Prezi developers affected from my findings.<p>I thank everyone here, and generally on the internet, for looking closer into my findings.<p>Thank you,\nShubham",1386118734

6844295,comment,6843330,6843330,1,0,icodestuff,,,"I disagree with a few points in this article, and can provide clarification on a few others. The clarifications first:<p>Bindings don&#x27;t exist in Cocoa Touch because they&#x27;re either slow (e.g. computed properties like @sum) because they&#x27;re mostly stateless, or memory intensive because... well, dig into the internals of KVO sometime - there are a huge number of caches to try to keep things fast. It&#x27;s not because KVO is a bad API. Heck, the KVO side of bindings is never exposed at all.<p>On the topic of infinite loops, yes, you have to be careful not to change an affecting property within an -observeValue... but it&#x27;s hardly unknowable what changes will cause a KVO notification. Indeed, it&#x27;s an isomorphic problem to breaking retain cycles, something every Obj-C programmer has to worry about every day, yes, even with ARC. The information is just stored in a different place, namely +keyPathsForValuesAffecting<Key> methods, rather than in property or ivar declarations. One can create a &quot;weak&quot; notification by removing oneself as an observer in the -observeValue, optionally adding oneself back at the end.<p>As for disagreements: \nKVO is not the old way. NSNotificationCenter and the delegate pattern predate KVO. Callback blocks don&#x27;t, and indeed where possible I&#x27;d recommend all of the above over KVO, but it&#x27;s hardly ancient, and certainly not &quot;the old way&quot;. It&#x27;s just a different way that allows you to watch for changes that doesn&#x27;t require the designers of an API to have provided hooks for you to do so explicitly.<p>On its implicitness, I can&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s any more implicit than delegates. The same criticism that you can&#x27;t command-click in Xcode to follow the code flow applies. Same thing with NSNotifications for that matter. That&#x27;s kind of the point. If it was all explicit, we wouldn&#x27;t have the dynamism that all of these mechanisms provide.<p>Re: &quot;An important thing to note is that KVO will throw an exception and crash our app if we try to remove the same observer twice.&quot; This is simply untrue. KVO will throw an exception and crash the app if you try to remove the same <i>observance</i> twice, but an observance is created each time you call -addObserver:.... That is, like retain and release, -addObserver: and -removeObserver: calls need to be balanced. Additionally, the author actually misses a part where KVO really is broken: &quot;[Using a static context pointer per observation] helps to make sure that none of our super- or subclasses can deregister us from being an observer.&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually work. Using -removeObserver:forKeyPath: will happily remove the first observance it comes across (the first that was registered, AFAICT, though this isn&#x27;t documented), regardless of its context; it&#x27;s not just a convenience method for -removeObserver:forKeyPath:context: that passes NULL for the last parameter.<p>Lastly, it seems quite silly to have a unique context for each object and key path per class. If they&#x27;re going to unique the contexts, you don&#x27;t need to check objects and key paths. Or, you only need one context per class, and then only if your inheritance tree does include multiple observing classes. On a related note, I think the complaint about having to call super if the superclass implements -observeValue... is ridiculous. This is how any method that might be implemented at multiple levels of an inheritance tree must be called. Same thing with a delegate whose superclass also conforms to that delegate protocol. Or -init. Or -dealloc. Or...<p>.<p>All that said, I still generally agree with the conclusions about when to use KVO, although is #3 is just a subset of #1, and I wouldn&#x27;t have phrased it as the author did (see the first paragraph of disagreement). I&#x27;d also add #4: Use KVO when you need the old values as well as the new values of the objects, and/or need to be notified prior to the value changing. NSNotificationCenter and delegates can do the same thing, but at the cost of double the number of methods that need to be written, and you&#x27;ll have to store the state yourself if you need the old value at the same time as the new value. That&#x27;s a lot of code that gets abstracted away by KVO, particularly if you&#x27;re observing multiple key paths on the same object and need all their old and new values. Code you don&#x27;t have to write is code you don&#x27;t have to debug.",1386117912

But shortage is a relative term--&quot;short&quot; relative to what?--and by some measures, there are real shortages in these situations. If we use corn instead of labor, for example, we might have a bad harvest one year, and the price of corn goes so high that it&#x27;s not worth buying for certain products. The market still clamors for those products but isn&#x27;t willing to pay what they would have to pay given the new price of corn. Your definition, if I understand it, would say that there is no shortage of corn; it&#x27;s just more expensive than you can pay.<p>I&#x27;d still call it a shortage of corn, because I&#x27;m thinking of it relative to previous years, future expectations, the causes of the price change, etc. Rent control or earthquakes cause what many would consider a housing shortage, gov&#x27;t price controls or bad weather create commodity shortages, and sufficiently generous welfare programs (you have to pay a lot more to make it worth working at all) or explosive increases in customer demand (not enough time for labor to learn new skills) can create labor shortages.<p>From the perspective of an employer, no longer being able to hire people at a wage that makes them worth hiring can be seen as a labor shortage, while from the perspective of a worker, no longer being able to get a job at a wage worth working for can be seen as a jobs shortage, but I agree with you that, especially if the changes are just the long-term evolution of the economy, there comes a point where it no longer makes sense to refer to something that will never come back as a &quot;shortage&quot;.",1386116876

6844169,comment,6843052,6843726,10,0,pak,,,"> In this case the most common misunderstanding seems to be not to realize that present day big companies were once small.  You could have pre-empted that by reminding readers that once companies reach a certain size they don&#x27;t have to rely on making something great to grow bigger, but that if you look back at the earliest history of those companies, you&#x27;ll find <i>most</i> did.  (emphasis mine)<p>It&#x27;s hard to call it a misunderstanding when the title of the post starts boldly with &quot;The Only&quot; and the first paragraph starts with &quot;All companies&quot;.  The premise of there being some universal rule for growth is absurd and requires only a few counterexamples, of which there are certainly many to consider (this page now contains dozens), to be demonstrably false.<p>By reinterpreting the author&#x27;s argument with a requalification of <i>most</i>, you&#x27;ve already reached a much more sane argument.  But you know as well as I do that this post would never frontpage if it had been called &quot;The Best Way to Get Huge&quot; or &quot;The Way Most Companies Become Huge&quot;.<p>Edit: Or maybe it would have anyway?  Sam Altman is a partner at YC [1] and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if such content gets a boost to frontpage no matter what.  After all, people have shown that penalties are applied to a hidden list of phrases and domains which boots them off the frontpage [2], so the same principle might be applied in reverse to certain things.  For example, the controversy penalty might be removed for certain domains.  I&#x27;m sorry, but after reading [2] my faith in the scoring system here is at an all-time low.<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really-works.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.righto.com/2013/11/how-hacker-news-ranking-really...</a>",1386116130

There&#x27;s some truth to this; if I own a bitcoin nobody is obligated to give me anything in exchange; it doesn&#x27;t exist as a liability on anyone&#x27;s balance sheet. And? The same is true of a gold ingot. Or, largely, or a share of Apple stock; nobody is obligated to give you anything for that share. By the same logic, the &quot;fair&quot; value of gold (or Apple stock) is zero.<p>Gold has some intrinsic value. If nothing else, it has some industrial uses. Bitcoin has no comparable intrinsic value.<p>Owning a share of AAPL common stock has value. You get voting rights in the company. You also have a claim to Apple&#x27;s assets, although with a lower priority than any bondholders or other creditors. So owning AAPL shares does come with obligations from Apple.<p>Euros (or dollars) also have some value as fiat currencies. You can pay debts and taxes in euros. The government has an obligation to accept euros as payment for taxes. So essentially these currencies are your ticket to stay out of jail.<p>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t share any of these qualities with gold, AAPL, or euros.

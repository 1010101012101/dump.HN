I did that stuff in highschool but it simply didn&#x27;t interest me in the same way.  Calculators were limited, and that presented both a challenge and a goalpost.  Doing the same stuff with webdev?

6304459,comment,6304088,6304423,2,0,gizmo686,,,"There are other methods. Firstly, factoring is mostly only useful for asymmetric algorithms, which are typically used only for key exchange. So, if you can negotiate your key through a secure side channel, then you do not need to worry about RSA. Additionally, in some respects, you might say that we have already had the breakthrough in factoring because of quantum computers. At this point it is simply a matter of engeneering a large enough quantum computer to be able to attack crypto-systems. Because of this most research into replacements is done under the name of post-quantum cryptography; and there appear to be several workable methods in that area.",1377899549

Physical books are still around, you know. Also, those costs are partially <i>marketing</i> costs -- having the book printed and out on the shelf in a bookstore is a form of marketing. While they may not have the printing and inventory costs of physical books, ebooks <i>definitely</i> have marketing costs and, <i>because</i> of the low barriers to entry in the market compared to the market for physical books, arguably have <i>more</i> competing noise that their marketing is trying to be heard over.

We all know it&#x27;s a bad approximation to say that &quot;&quot; is &quot;la&quot; or &quot;ra&quot;, but it&#x27;s the best approximation available.

Indeed, this one-to-two mapping problem is so well-known, that there are demeaning &quot;jokes&quot; about saying &quot;lice&quot; when one means &quot;rice&quot;, and so on.<p>Anyway, my point was this: your description of English articulation had some minor errors in it, which I <i>tried</i> to improve upon.<p>> <i>If I pronounce la (laa) ... in English, my tongue ... at some point touches my gums behind my bottom teeth</i><p>That may be true for you, but this is not typical.

You now have a metric which can be used <i>independently</i> of the usability domain (it can apply to mall signage or kitchen appliances as readily as desktop software, Web pages, or a tablet app).<p>Ultimately, software does <i>something</i>.  It might sell stuff (measure sales), it might provide entertainment, though in most cases that boils down to selling stuff.  It might help design something, or model a problem, or create art.  In many cases you can still reduce this to &quot;sell something&quot;, in which case, if you&#x27;re a business, or part of one, you&#x27;ve probably got a metric you can use.<p>For systems which don&#x27;t result in a sales transaction directly or indirectly, &quot;usability&quot; probably approaches the metric you want:  does a change accomplish a task faster and/or with more accuracy?  Does it achieve an objectively better or preferable (double-blind tested) result?<p>The problem is that there are relatively few changes which can be tested conclusively or independently.  And there are what Dennis Meadows calls &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; problems.<p>Easy problems offer choices in which a change is monotonic across time.  Given alternatives A and B, if choice A is better than B at time t, it will be better at time t+n, for any n.  You can rapidly determine which of the two alternatives you should choose.<p>Hard problems provide options which <i>aren&#x27;t</i> monotonic.  A may give us the best long-term results, but if it compares unfavorably initially, this isn&#x27;t apparent.

HP had a &quot;Game Pac&quot; for the HP-67 that included blackjack, craps, a slot machine game, a sub hunt game, an artillery firing game, a space war game, a game based on &quot;Mastermind&quot;, Nim, and more.<p>The HP-41C, introduced in 1979, and (amusingly) discontinued in 1990 (the year the author says game design became feasible on calculators) had an alphanumeric display so it could do word-based games, and Hangman and an an Adventure-like game were available.",1377897767

I have read so very many psychology papers in top-ranked journals that commit basic, stupid statistical mistakes all the time. And no-one seems to learn.<p>If you use a linear regression rather than ANOVA, you will often be asked to change it to an ANOVA.<p>I am well aware of the breadth and depth that is psychology, and most of it is poorly conducted and irritatingly bad. I actually think it has a lot to do with applying a particular experimental model of science developed for non-reflexive systems to reflexive systems, with predictably hilarious results.<p>Please do not take out the rest of the commentators opinions on me, it upsets me also when people bash psychology from ignorance, but I come from a place of love when I bash it, as I do really adore the subject, but feel that much of it is so very, very awfully done.<p>A/B testing - psychology degrees teach pretty good experimental design, but you wouldn&#x27;t know it to see a lot of published research. Additionally, rigorous experimental design owes a lot more to statistics than psychology.<p>UX Testing: This is definitely a good area, but again I think we don&#x27;t control enough for the impact of the researcher(s) - see Rosenthal, 1969 for the problem, and note the complete lack of care regarding these effects in modern psychology.<p>Grief management? Seriously? I don&#x27;t really think psychology has added much here, but would be delighted to read some good papers that prove me wrong.<p>Ameliorating sexism and racism? Good intentions, but given that I read a lot of this stuff I would have to say that they are perhaps the worst for statistical sins and errors (with the notable exception of Brian Nosek).<p>I know very little about perception research in HUD&#x27;s, do you have some good papers?<p>I&#x27;m not entirely certain why you felt the need to correct me, when if you look at my comments in the overall thread it can be seen that I am pretty much on the same side as you.<p>It is possible that I am so sick of people who commit statistical sins for career advancement purposes (something I could never do) that I may be taking it out on the field.<p>Incidentally, what is psychology?

6304237,comment,6303654,6304158,9,0,jacobolus,,,"Sorry. Let me try to make it relevant:<p>(1) I think its great to give kids general-purpose tools for unstructured hacking. Theres enormous pedagogical value for every person in learning to think procedurally, break things down into parts, debug algorithms, and explore mathematical systems. Every teacher should read <i>Mindstorms</i>.<p>(2) General purpose computers are nowadays really great for this, if the proper programming environments get set up on them. They have awesome screens for displaying neat graphics. They have reasonable keyboards for quickly typing in code and numbers and symbols. They have amazing CPUs and GPUs which can crunch numbers like nobodys business.<p>(3) I think we should start kids programming at age 5-8 with a tool like Scratch or Logo or I dunno what, but something designed and tested on children, with good sets of materials and curricula set up to teach them to do exploratory programming.<p>(4) I think at some point students should be given tools which give them low-level access to hardware, like I dunno an Arduino or something. These things are getting to be $20-30 now, and its possible to use them for all sorts of nifty stuff and learn how to operate on constrained systems and twiddle bits in memory and whatever supposed advantage a TI calculator would offer, if thats the goal.<p>(5) Many people dont use tablet computers (or other computers) in math courses in school in a very pedagogically sound way, and a lot of software used in schools is terrible. (Giving access to open-ended exploratory systems is much better than giving access to one-purpose constrained tools.) This is too bad, because big color multitouch displays are really nice input/output devices for many purposes.<p>(6) Its all well and good that the original author and many other people had a nice experience programming a TI calculator as a way to stave off boredom in math class, or whatever. But TI graphing calculators were overpriced and outdated and frankly pretty crappy relative to other devices people used 10 years ago, as long as we get the right software on those devices. By now its just ridiculous. Making people type BASIC into a calculator using tiny buttons and a little monochrome screen is not the right way to introduce mathematics, or programming, or anything else.",1377897144

I was to enter the UIL contest titled &quot;Calculator Math&quot; or something like that. It was a speed contest. My school (small rural public school), having the smartest and best-prepared students won at the first level of competition beating everyone. We punched our buttons furiously, we were punching buttons as fast as is possible without having registration errors. We figured nobody could beat us, since we made few errors. At the next level we competed, something went wrong. The test went as usual, we finished most of the exam in the allotted time, but did not score well enough to advance. The thing is, after about two-thirds of the allotted time had passed, students from other schools started getting up and leaving. During the exam, I smugly assumed they were giving up because I _knew_ that nobody was a significantly faster button-pusher than me, not by that large an amount. I was puzzled. Later I learned what an RPN calculator was, and began to understand what happened. I am a college instructor today, and I have yet to meet a student who knows what an RPN calculator is. Nearly every teacher&#x27;s supply catalog that gets crammed into my mail sells TI exclusively.",1377896984

It&#x27;s a legitimate problem in school systems around the world - most kids are taught from an early age to do exactly what the teacher says and that&#x27;s how you learn. Thus, they never learn anything on their own.",1377896530

There&#x27;s a reason studying is synonymous with a quiet place, or with people also studying with you.  Doing it under less ideal circumstances than that creates overhead on your attempts to &quot;get ahead&quot; that people with means do not have to deal with.  Not making excuses for myself, I am of means, but I can definitely see how an uphill situation quickly becomes a complete vertical situation.",1377896527

They have a relatively high educational utility for their cost.<p>On the other hand, I agree that curriculum&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t be catered around calculators. A good high school math curriculum would let people know what can be done numerically, what can&#x27;t, and spend a small amount of time teaching people how to do the numerical things on their calculators (or whatever the tool of choice is).",1377896512

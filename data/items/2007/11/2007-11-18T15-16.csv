That said, I'm aiming more at the home user / small business market -- large corporations have other options (e.g., backup appliances from EMC and suchlike).<p>I figure that I'll build the version of tarsnap that I want to use, and if/when that becomes popular I'll decide where to go next based on demand.",1195401530
81224,comment,81203,81221,0,0,aswanson,,,"I see.  At any rate, you may want to consider divorcing your product from any particular storage scheme.  Corporate customers, who usually honor licenses, have tons of unused storage (on every desktop).  You might want to consider a distributed scheme where, from a common management tool, an operator could have a virtual encrypted backup across an enterprise.<p>In any event, good luck and godspeed.",1195400924

What advantages does it have over developing a plain old website in your platform of choice? Not trying to start a flame war just trying to understand what I am missing here.",1195400766

I'll make the source code available for people to inspect (and compile for themselves) so that they don't have to blindly trust the binaries I provide; but it will be under a ""you can use this only as part of the tarsnap backup service"" license.",1195400497

I would think it would be in your interest to do the opposite.  Am I missing something?",1195399746

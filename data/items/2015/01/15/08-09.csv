Fallbacks complicate that, but the fallback SCSV signals enough to correctly sound the alarm there too.<p>I&#x27;m specifically on the lookout for sneaky ways to (GCHQ call it) &quot;stain&quot; traffic like that, and try to remove them. (&quot;Kleptography&quot; is similar, but the endpoint is complicit - there&#x27;s not a lot can be done when the endpoint is complicit, but more deterministic primitives help both.)<p>These can be rather subtle - with temporal differentiation as well, even 1 bit allows for a basic binary search/partitioning attack, so anonymity networks like Tor, I2P etc have to be particularly careful about that.<p>(You shouldn&#x27;t really be using TLS 1.0/1.1 anymore, and definitely not SSL.)",1421312361

8891527,comment,8888635,8891331,0,0,scintill76,,,"> But internal memos leaked by a former N.S.A. contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the N.S.A. generated one of the random number generators used in a 2006 N.I.S.T. standard — called the Dual EC DRBG standard — which contains a back door for the N.S.A. In publishing the standard, N.I.S.T. acknowledged “contributions” from N.S.A., but not primary authorship.<p>> Internal N.S.A. memos describe how the agency subsequently worked behind the scenes to push the same standard on the International Organization for Standardization. “The road to developing this standard was smooth once the journey began,” one memo noted. “However, beginning the journey was a challenge in finesse.”<p>> At the time, Canada’s Communications Security Establishment ran the standards process for the international organization, but classified documents describe how ultimately the N.S.A. seized control. “After some behind-the-scenes finessing with the head of the Canadian national delegation and with C.S.E., the stage was set for N.S.A. to submit a rewrite of the draft,” the memo notes. “Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor.” [0]<p>Yes, it&#x27;s somewhat circumstantial, but pretty damning.  If they weren&#x27;t backdooring it, I&#x27;d like to hear an alternate explanation for why the NSA has memos about, in their own words, &quot;behind-the-scenes finessing&quot; to &quot;become the sole editor&quot; and &quot;rewrite&quot; an international standard.  All that hard work quietly manipulating things to be just how they want them and, oopsie, the standard just might have a back door!  Meanwhile, as described in other comments here, they paid RSA Security to deploy the standard; and were made aware of the possibility of a backdoor[1], but for whatever reason continued recommending its use.<p>I&#x27;d entertain arguments that they were actually trying to strengthen it, as may have happened with DES, but in this case, they were pushing something that civilian contemporaries knew was dangerous.  Malice or incompetence seem more likely than secret benevolence here.  Or is there some other reasonable explanation I&#x27;m missing?<p>[0] <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announces-steps-to-restore-confidence-on-encryption-standards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announce...</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/patent.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/patent.html</a>",1421312178

I&#x27;m an italian computer engineer and work as a freelance with VAT number since 5 years and i can say that there are no fiscal or burocratic simplifications and aids for startup.<p>There is a reason why a lot of italians preferred to create a ltd based in the UK instead of a srl in italy. There is a reason why a lot of italian entreprenuers are moving to Switzerland. There is a reason why a lot of italians base their business in Tenerife (even if i don&#x27;t accept this fiscal-escamotage, i can&#x27;t blame them too much).<p>As an example of the business complications here in italy, even if i own a computer engineer consultancy VAT type, i can&#x27;t send invoices to Google to get money from GoogleAds: i need to add another VAT specification (paying money) and register my self to the chamber of commerce (again paying) and having a more complicated fiscal management (for my business consultant&#x27;s joy!) just because at that point, i&#x27;m in the advertising business (really? small GoogleAds income is an advertising business?!).<p>In italy you can go with the same invoices (incomes and expenses) to two different business consultant and they will produce two different tax declarations! And in the case of a fiscal check, you will find that maybe none of them was right! This is ridiculous, but this is the reality of Italy because fiscal law and bureaucracy are a real mess!<p>Talking about startup: if you read well you will find that there are a lot of obstacles in the opening of a startup in italy: an an example you must set at least 15% of the bigger between income or expenses for R&D, you must have at least a third of the workforce as Ph. D. and you must own a patent...and they call it &quot;innovative startup in italy[1]&quot;...do you find it easy and comfortable? Please, if you understand italian language, go and see Report Startup Stories [2]<p>Last, it is true that Italy is a beautiful country and that if you own a small business located in the north, maybe you won&#x27;t have too much problems with criminality, but remember that it is true that mafia has people and hands on the most important political chairs and in the richest businesses.

That&#x27;s where the founders of GFM worked before they moved on to their current, highly successful venture.  I imagine that&#x27;s where the startup bug bit them and they learned the value of being the middleman for transactions while leveraging social networks.  SMS.ac was a middleman for SMS billing and a social network, generating text messages that were sent to users and receiving a share of the text charge from the cellular carriers.  I worked with them there, crazy but good times.",1421309104

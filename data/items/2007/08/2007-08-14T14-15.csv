42240,comment,42238,42238,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"It's all about getting inside your target customers' heads and dissecting their buying decisions.  Only then can you hit upon the right strategy.  When you have drastically different buyer profiles, then you segment the market.  In other words, you need to first answer questions like is this an impulse buy, is this a comparison buy, is it personal or company money being used, etc.<p>My last startup charged for a web-based service.  It was a consumer impulse buy and so we tried to keep the price down for that reason.  When we got enough size, we ran statistical tests to figure out the best price point in terms of maximization of profits.<p>I also have had experience selling an online book.  As you suggest, sometimes the demand curve is not a straight line and raising the price can increase volume because prices can of course influence perceived value.  I raised it from $9.99 to $24.99 and that is exactly what happened--increased volume.",1187103012

42238,story,,,7,15,rrival,"On Pricing Strategy",,"I'm working on a business model that requires charging something for a web-based service (not consulting/nothing hourly). I've never known where to begin the process of arriving at the 'right' price. Clearly, there are marketing/customer perception implications to:<p>1) providing something on a free trial basis initially 
2) increasing the cost of a service later
3) charging too little and being deemed insignificant ""How could $5/month give me that much value?""
4) charging too much and being seen as a ripoff, leaving room for others to step in. <p>I know it's easy enough to arrive at or at least be aware of a market price (median/average) if there's enough competition in the space to do a back-of-napkin statistical analysis. I'm not sure how that carries over into concepts with a 'first mover' advantage, or markets where competition is light.<p>I know there must be theory relevant to this (probably volumes). Can anyone recommend a place to start? How have you dealt with pricing your startup's services? ",1187102091

42233,comment,42207,42207,0,0,jraines,,,"This is a good supplement if you're interested in the free vs. not-free debate (aka M. Arrington vs. 37signals).  The concept of ""mental transaction costs"" -- the ""cost"" associated with making a decision of whether something is worth paying for and how much is it worth -- is a useful one.  For me personally, if I decide something, particularly an <i>online service</i>, is worth paying for <i>at all</i>, I'd probably just as soon pay $20 as some fraction of a penny.  In other words, if it's not free and it's claiming to add value to my life, it had better be adding at least $20 worth and convince me as such.  Then again I've never given much thought as to what micropayments <i>would</i> be good for, so counterpoints are welcome.",1187100446

The parts that have been leaked are core site functionality, which means they were probably written early on.  PHP5 was still quite new and untested when FaceBook was developed in 2004.

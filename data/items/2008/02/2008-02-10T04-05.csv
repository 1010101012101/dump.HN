112897,comment,112742,112891,0,0,aston,,,"You misunderstand Microsoft. They listen to their customers probably more than any other software company I know. Unfortunately, they have way more customers than any other software company I know. Hence the feature creep. They'll pretty much add anything people ask for (especially if people = big companies paying $75/Office seat). The definition of ""what they do well"" is Office, and in particular the fact that it's a jack of all trades, and a master of most.<p>As for the default font, I believe it's actually Calibri, which is a great  sans serif font. Personal preference will dictate whether it's appropriate for your uses, but that's why it's a dropdown menu and not a hardcoded value. If I had to guess why they left Times New Roman, I would guess because based on their collected statistics more people use sans serif fonts, or maybe just that it's more readable. Also, TNR is pretty ugly.",1202619025

No application process, and typical friendlier court procedures.<p>With a patent, you need to prove in court that your <i>idea</i> was novel.<p>With copyrights, you just need to prove that you wrote your code first.",1202617869

Since the beginning of 2007 Yahoo's share price has averaged around $25 or so, with a low of $22.73 and a high of $33.63. The pre-bid low this year was $19.05, and was probably due to the fact that the majority of the industry was taking a beating, along with the rest of the economy.<p>When companies offer takeovers, they usually pay a premium in share price, however Microsoft took advantage of the state of the economy by offering a takeover at a particularly low point in share price, allowing them to offer an  artificial premium that was - when compared to YHOO average share price - at only a $5 premium, or 20%.",1202617582

Meaning, they want TNR font, pt 12, and perhaps 1 inch margins double spaced. Of course, Microsoft wouldn't know that because rather than listening to users they're trying to buy yahoo to expand their horizons.<p>I'm not really trying to criticize microsoft, I just felt that I should point out that Microsoft seems to be overreaching in terms of the things its trying to do and pushing ""ahead"" when many aren't really ready or willing to deal with the changes they make. Are they listening to their customers anymore or are they simply assuming that people will use their stuff because thats all they know to use?<p>Seems to me its the latter, and that they're going ahead to be a jack-of-all-trades instead of doing what they do well.",1202617320

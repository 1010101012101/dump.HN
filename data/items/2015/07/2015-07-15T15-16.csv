Whether it be teachers giving out notes in .PPT or requesting that essays be sent to them in Word&#x27;s format so they can leave notes and send them back. This happens at the university level too outside the known-for-computer schools like MIT, Stanford, etc.<p>I will say, though, if you&#x27;re going into a computer-related field in the future, having a Linux box will put you ahead of a lot of your peers--at least it used to. Maybe Ubuntu is too nice now, but years ago by forcing myself to use Linux as my OS exclusively, I learned a lot of skills I still use much later in life. From SSH to manually mounting drives to xorg configurations to SSH forwarding to etc etc. The forcing yourself to use it exclusively is best for learning, but even having a small headless Debian box in the corner of your room is helpful for learning about different things.",1436975982

It takes more effort to browse a foreign language site (even if one competent in that language). If one is browsing for leisure, or just following idle curiosity, this is enough to tip the scales against you. Added to that, distance makes browsing the web frustrating and flaky.<p>This also affects SEO. It is not necessarily clear which search terms will gain you a favourable ranking on Baidu, or how to spell them, or which system of writing will make your site visible to someone searching from China on your subject matter. Web dev (and programming in general) is an important topic in China, but web culture is very different in China in terms of page design and user interaction. Most of those issues will be already addressed in a more relevant and immediately practical way already by the Chinese competition.<p>You cannot rely on a &#x27;build it and they will come&#x27; position. Right now China is in the exciting process of discovering itself through the mass communication of the web as it becomes available to the population in general, and not just the elite. It is like the wild west times at the inception of the world wide web in the West. They are forging a common culture of shared understanding, points of reference and even a distinct lingua-franca to facilitate communication between the different regions of China.<p>In short, the Chinese are not looking to the West right now because it is far more interesting and engaging to focus &#x27;inwards&#x27; in what is happening in China. If you wish to draw a Chinese audience to your blog, you will have to immerse yourself in this emerging culture, discover which topics are of interest there, and learn how to communicate in the evolving local idiom. In short, you will have to grapple with the same barrier that keeps the Chinese from visiting your site.<p>I suspect that there are Chinese bloggers wondering as you are, why there are so few visitors from the West.",1436975915

And yes, it is &quot;thousands of dollars&quot; cheaper to do a grid tie system, and yet the regulatory changes are making it harder on home solar systems to recover costs (mostly because it shifts peak load costs toward the utility and away from the individual rate payer, the utilities are trying to avoid that).<p>And the article is discussing a &quot;future&quot; world where almost all individual houses are <i>not</i> grid tied, rather they are perhaps grid backed up, in the event that there isn&#x27;t enough solar or wind to keep their house batteries up.<p>So in that world, where folks are converting their &quot;old&quot; grid tied system to the &quot;new&quot; grid independent systems, it is going to change other parts of the community that break when external events disrupt the grid.

Yes, we have significant issues and yes the VA and all the parties need to do a better job taking care of us. It took me 9 months alone to get my disability rating and VA benefits card - and many wait much longer - which is time that they aren&#x27;t getting treatment.<p>The broader population only know about these issues through Jon Stewart or from recent press, but have no connection with it otherwise nor could they really care. Should they? I don&#x27;t know, probably, but not necessarily.<p>Even within the military only those who are have been in the Army, or were deployed to a combat zone, really understand the significance of a CIB. So expecting anyone to recognize it, let alone start a conversation around it would be unexpected at the least - I know I wouldn&#x27;t start a conversation around it. Putting it on display is hack and is looking for attention.<p>I don&#x27;t think that the US population owes us anything, but many veterans don&#x27;t agree. This is part of a broader conversation about how the US public sees and interacts with it&#x27;s veterans and the military more broadly. At the end of the day though the Stolen Valor shaming, demanding veteran/military discounts just reeks of entitlement. Given that we have been an all-volunteer force over the past 40 years I don&#x27;t think anyone can claim they didn&#x27;t know what they were getting into, granting that there are shady practices with recruiting that go on.<p>In the end, I feel like stories like this just isolate veterans further.

Sounds like an acquisition not acquihire.<p><i>So I know I need to get out in front of my management team before they make a deal I&#x27;ll walk away from, but this is new territory for me and I have no idea what would be reasonable to ask for and what would get me laughed out of the room.</i><p>I&#x27;m also confused about this - the terms of the sale will ultimately be negotiated by the founders and the board, I doubt you will be involved. What you will get out of the sale will be based on your vesting schedule - there&#x27;s no negotiation there you will just be told what has been agreed, and what your vest %age works out as (which could be cash, stock in acquiring party or both). And if the sale amount was low and there were liquidation preferences for the preferred holders, you might get nothing other than a job offer. Which brings me onto the part you can negotiate.<p>The acquiring party will want to meet with you to go over their individual retainment package with you as you join their company. They normally play it as a renegotiated continuation of your vest at the startup.<p>However, If it is an acquihire a key piece of information to try to find out is what your equity package would be if you joined off the street rather than through the acquihire. I&#x27;ve seen examples where the package isn&#x27;t much better than off the street.<p>You should also go interview at another big company to find out what their offer would be.

There is a viable business model here, its like insurance that if you need an additional long term office next Monday, just walk in to &quot;your&quot; space.  It might be cheaper to make one transaction, pay your 6% or more of commissions and fees, underuse the space, than to pay two 6% commissions and fees (and labor to do the second deal).<p>Several employers ago I got to learn about financial industry disaster recovery plans and you&#x27;d be surprised how many traders have an empty office squirreled away on the other side of the city as their tornado/fire recovery plan.  Sure only 1/20th the employees would fit, but its only 5% the rental cost of the real office and some bean counter said that was an acceptable loss to provision an office with no people and a stack of server hardware.  If they let people work from the D.R. site that would be a public admission that people don&#x27;t need to work in a bullpen and could just as well work from starbucks or home, but that would not meet the emotional need to intimidate people in person and demonstrate butts-in-seats metric goals so using the D.R. space for actual work would be unthinkable unless the main office was literally on fire.<p>This combines with open office style, such that people can&#x27;t avoid noticing unused space, although unused space is hardly a new feature of the business world.  There&#x27;s a small room right down the hall from me, but its behind a locked door, so no one notices.  If they were not an open office company, they&#x27;d just lock a door and no one would notice.  Placing their capacity on display like this is arguably an architectural design fail, they should have found an architectural way to &quot;hide&quot; empty space from casual visitors in an attractive and cheap manner.",1436975418

The issue with minimum wage isn&#x27;t that it rejects supply-and-demand (that&#x27;s simplistic thinking), it&#x27;s that it is means-tested. Minimum wage doesn&#x27;t directly help independent contractors or self-employed folks…<p>We need a Universal Basic Income and then to get rid of welfare and minimum wage and such.<p>But seeing as that won&#x27;t happen soon, there&#x27;s a very interesting positive aspect to minimum wage: People working for only social reasons such as volunteers or unpaid apprenticeships have a different psychosocial relationship to their situation than those who are paid an hourly wage. It&#x27;s far better to be paid nothing than to be paid 10¢ an hour. Paid nothing means <i>everyone</i> acknowledges that you are volunteering your time, and it doesn&#x27;t mean you are worthless. Paid 10¢ means you are worth 10¢. This has been studied by folks like Dan Ariely.<p>So, a minimum wage requires that people&#x27;s time have a dignified enough value put on it, and anything less you must work with them on a volunteer, social basis.<p>I still think it has problems and UBI is better, but this issue of dignified pay should be appreciated.",1436975416

9891909,comment,9889149,9890825,0,0,fredkbloggs,,,"More generally, you need to be aware of the ratings and proper installation methods for the equipment and materials you are using.  Nearly all PV modules today are rated for a 600V system voltage, as are most combiner boxes and common wire types.  Not all breakers are, though!  Higher voltage requires higher-rated and sometimes more expensive equipment as well as more careful work, but it allows longer wire runs with less copper which saves money, and it may enable you to use more efficient equipment as well.  All depends on what you&#x27;re trying to accomplish.  If you aren&#x27;t comfortable doing a 600V (or 300V, or 150V) wiring job, you need to weigh the disadvantages of lower system voltages (less flexible, more costly to wire, limited options for batteries and other equipment) against the cost of hiring someone qualified to do the work.<p>I don&#x27;t subscribe to the idea that a rooftop system should be limited to 800W.  An 800W system is not viable for grid-tied use (with modern modules you&#x27;re looking at 3 modules in series which will not even give you 120V much less the required 340 or 480 to do proper grid-tied installation), and will not be cost-effective for an off-grid application unless you have a very small house, minimal power needs, and have a sunny climate year-round.<p>Know your needs.  Know your abilities.  Know your equipment.  Safety first should not be in conflict with building a cost-effective system that meets your needs; if you can&#x27;t figure out how to do so properly, hire someone who knows!",1436975017

As the article stated all languages are about communication. Each language has its own syntax (ie words and word order) but the concept of a rose or money is the same, the concept of an action is the same as is the concept of a pronoun otherwise people would not be able to translate between languages. The semantics of a language are often tied up in the culture of the language.<p>When it comes to computer languages similar principles are at play. The concept of a list or array or matrix of values is common across a wide variety of language types for OO to Functional to Declarative. As is the concept of IO. The need to communicate with something outside of the program. The fact that some languages point out the and IO operation is about to occur does not mean that the paradigm does not use or need them.<p>In short: Speak English when you are in Britain, yorkshire when in Yorkshire, cockney when in London, and Mandarin when in China.

It&#x27;s actually possible for people to take actions which they don&#x27;t prefer to take.<p>Praxeology IMHO is thoroughly unscientific, contradicts modern neuroscience and psychology with many of its assumptions about people, and a dubious exercise, and its use by Austrians to argue against public policy actions extremely weak.<p>To me the purpose of economics is to study the real world as close as you can, and make predictions that can be used to not only understand our condition or future problems, but to make adjustments so as to create better outcomes.<p>It is not to provide an ideological, philosophical basis for those actions, or for no actions at all. It&#x27;s the difference between Medicine and Bioethics.<p>Both the Chicago school and the Austrian school start out with assuming the outcomes -- a free market s what&#x27;s desired, and produced the best outcomes. They they work backwards using different methods to justify their conclusions.<p>I prefer not making the assumption that the unfettered free market produces the best outcome always. For example, when externalities are not priced in for things human beings care about in the abstract but not in their day to day preferences, like the long term ecosystem, or the health and welfare of future generations, I prefer a system of economics that works on a case by case basis, looking at problems, and figuring out experiments to run or course corrections.<p>If economics is unpredictable, or the consequences of actions unknowable it also means the consequences of inaction or the &#x27;free market&#x27; are unknowable, but that&#x27;s no basis for siding against government action. We live in a complex evolutionary system, and it may be the only way to get out of local optima is to run lots of experiments that fail, including government intervention.<p>That&#x27;s why I think a mixed economy is a more evolutionary stable strategy than a pure free market or marxist one.<p>I also think it&#x27;s more moral than either of those.",1436974840

The politicians, pundits and supports cite fundamentals quite a lot. The efficiencies and incentives of free markets, with policies relating fairly directly to economic textbooks (of agreeable persuasions).<p>I don&#x27;t want to stigmatize by calling it &quot;economic ideology&quot; as this implies an irrationality that I don&#x27;t mean to imply, but ideology is more or less what I mean, sans value judgements. Its unfortunate that has become a bad word.<p>This writer is calling it &quot;economistic&quot; and means a strong expectation that the basic economic models like supply and demand are predictive of the real world effects. So, he expects the minimum wages to result in unemployment. This may be the real rationale for him, but I think the wider political weight of this is only there because it dovetails with other (US-sh) freedom concepts. IE, I think the idea that two people can decide on a wage contract without outside intervention has an appeal beyond just it&#x27;s economic effects to many in that political camp.<p>In any case, my point is that this kind of theoretical grounding and economic <i>fundamental</i>ism (again sans-value judgment, I just mean they often tie policies to theoretical fundamentals) is something in recession in other places and political camps. The big examples are the bastard descendants of communism, arguably the most confidently touted and complete economic-political big-T Theory in history.<p>For example, take &quot;labour-socialism&quot; the big central-left camp in europe. Once upon a time, they believed in labour unionism a variant of socialism. Not just as a means to an end, but as a fundamentally grounded ideology. The way to make industry thrive, create prosperity for workers, etc. It still exists as a real-politic hodgepodge of policies and rhetoric roughly espousing old labour values, but not really labour unionism ideology. It&#x27;s not comparable to the economic liberalism of the US right.<p>The Chinese communist party was once… communist. 5 year plans. means of production, the whole shebang.<p>The remaining left in Europe and elsewhere is very non theory based. The have strong a social and economic goals and values, but not really a big theory about how everything works best. There is no consistent, underlying economic theory like the US right has. It still holds a lot of socialist values and even<p>We get back to words like idealist or fundamentalist that have negative connotations, an interesting thing in itself.

If so, which parts will you DIY vs. hire out, and what research, supplies, tools, and materials will be required to do the work in a way that will pass inspection?<p>Once you have some answers there, you can start figuring out what kind of equipment could meet your needs and pricing it out.  &quot;I want solar!&quot; is not a constructive way to look at anything; it&#x27;s a great way to waste a bunch of money on something that will end up not giving you what you want/need.

What you type in will get rearranged in situ so it&#x27;s in the right format. If you prefer something else - well, good luck with that, because you can type it in, and it will compile, but you run the risk of somebody doing something that will cause the file to be reformatted and you&#x27;ll end up with the standard layout anyway. Best get used to it now. (As I understand it, gofmt is very similar.)<p>This functionality is actually a benefit, because you can type in something like this:<p><pre><code>    public Fred(int[]x):base(x){
    UpdateStuff();}
    </code></pre>

No need to wear out your space bar and/or Return key putting the formatting in.

By all means negotiate that, but that&#x27;s for after the sale is agreed, and treat it as what it is: an employment negotiation with an entirely new company. Remember you can always walk away.<p>As a shareholder, on the other hand, the board should be representing your interests <i>as a shareholder</i>.

However, in general even in those cases the acquirer wants at least 1-2 key employees to help them through the transition.  I have been though a couple of these with Public companies being the acquirer and am familiar with it.  Also, if this was the route the startup would likely be required to pay investors first from the sale, and the chance you or anyone else gets anything is fairly low (so you want/hope for an equity sale not an asset sale).<p>In the end, you aren&#x27;t a founder so in reality unless the founders are including you on the discussions you won&#x27;t know for sure what is happening or being discussed.  If the founders are good people (but maybe bad business sense), hopefully they will be fighting for their team.  You did mention you have a significant equity stake, if it is large enough you may be able to get a seat at the table, depending on if it is options or granted stock and what class of stock it is etc.  Also, part of this all depends on how many people are in the company and what the skill set makeup is like. e.g. 6 people total with 4 being devs is different than 6 people with 1 dev when it comes time to be acquired.<p>If the acquirer is a large firm with in place development and product management the chances of you staying in control of the product are slim long term.  Short term you might have some say, 3-6 months, but longer term you likely will not.  That isn&#x27;t to say you couldn&#x27;t, but the odds are against it generally speaking.  The smaller the acquirer is, the better the chance you get to stay in a more controlling spot.<p>As for what to do to protect you, don&#x27;t try to sour the deal, but make sure that you negotiate what is fair to you.  I&#x27;d stick out the acquihire if the deal was reasonable, you may have to stick around for 12 months or so but for that you may get a small amount of stock or cash.  I have not ever done this part, so others here are probably a better source of information.",1436973328

Average case: in a year they regret the acquisition, because they realized they&#x27;ll never make back the money they paid for it.

Honestly, in my next job I&#x27;d like to go 100% WFH - the amount of time saved from commuting is huge and, from an organisational perspective, if I get inspired over the weekend or the evening I&#x27;m much more likely just to get some bits and pieces done.<p>Unfortunately there&#x27;s still a lot of legacy managers and people who make the transition tricky.

They&#x27;ve had to tag and classify each one of these by hand. I bet we could help out with that....<p>About you: You&#x27;ve got experience with OCR. You know the types of data that you can extract and you know how to act on it. In the longer term, you&#x27;re interested in joining a small team and owning full feature sets or eventually entire product lines.<p>More about us: We&#x27;re addressing the entirely old school process of borrowing money to buy a house. Right now, the industry is driven by huge stacks of paper and casual handshakes. We believe that using contemporary design and data analysis, we can deliver something 10x better.<p>Or to put it another way, we do SaaS for non-technical users and we&#x27;re growing fast (double-digit month-over-month). Everyday, clients call and email us to say that we&#x27;re making them happy, and that feels great. We have solid penetration in one segment of the market. We’re looking to hire another core engineer to help us expand further.<p>The technical details: Our app is built in Ruby on Rails and we deploy to AWS. We have an agile team structure. Since we&#x27;re so early, you&#x27;ll be helping set the tone for our culture. If there&#x27;s something you want to hack on, it&#x27;s something you can hack on. Ideally, you&#x27;ll have 3-5+ years engineering experience.<p>The practical details: We&#x27;re in San Francisco in Union Square, near to BART and MUNI. We have a lovely office above an antique shop and this is an onsite position. We offer health insurance and generous vacation. Compensation will be salary plus meaningful equity. As an early engineer you&#x27;ll be shaping this company.<p>More details: pivotal, git, rails, Postgres, slack, opsworks, AWS, javascript, balsamiq<p>Get in touch: jobs@snapdocs.com.",1436972792

If I was buying a car and the next version of the car the next year moved the dials to the other side of the dashboard or swapped whether the indicator stalk was on the right or the left of the steering wheel, you&#x27;d ask what the heck was going on.

Or would you expect Apple to backport fixes when they know that a sizeable percentage of customers are connecting to their App Store with older versions, given your purchase fee of the hardware?<p>The solution to not getting updates for a device is not to buy a new device.<p>Google boasts how many devices they have all over the world (see last year&#x27;s io keynote) and how Android is everywhere, yet it failed to mention the important point about Android being everywhere: that it is insecure outdated Android that is everywhere.<p>Google know how many people are connecting with older versions (the Play dashboard tells you what percentage is running which version), so they should push out updates or mandate in their agreement with phone manufacturers that a timely update cycle should be followed, or the agreement would be terminated. There would be no other way to keep control or maintain a high standard.<p>I say this with a plethora of Android devices and with my dayjob of writing Android apps.

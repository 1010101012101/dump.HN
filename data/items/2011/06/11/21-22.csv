Folks here are not likely to accept some colloquial self-determined definition of a term like ""psychopath"" when it has a clear clinical definition.<p>I have two very challenging children, one of whom is not empathetic, tends towards narcissism and so on.  Like you, he stays out of trouble by making judicious choices concerning the longer range consequences of his actions which I spent a lot of time educating him about (in other words, I did not appeal to some sense of morally ""right"" behavior, which he lacks, instead I focused on developing a perspective of enlightened self-interest).  He shares many traits with his father, my ex husband, whom I found quite difficult to deal with.  But I get along extremely well with my oldest son.  He was raised very differently from his father.  He has a very similar nature to his father but the nurture part varied considerably and the difference in outcome has been substantial.<p>EDIT:  Which is to say I agree with a point I feel you are trying to make that having X trait in no way guarantees Y outcome.  Most people who know him superficially describe my oldest son as ""very polite and respectful"" or ""a very nice young man"". Others who have had to deal with him more than just superficially tend to find him pretty crazy-making.",1307829457

2644971,comment,2644427,2644774,5,0,rdtsc,,,"Alright, that is an interesting take. I looked around and found these characteristics of both.<p>* Both psychopaths and people Asperger's might make comments that hurt other people. Those with Asperger's will do it un-intentionally, they just don't understand all the rules of social interaction and they won't even know they would be hurting others. Psychopaths will often say things in order to hurt other. So the difference is that they will knowingly hurt others while those with Asperger's  won't.<p>* Psychopaths are better at learning and mimicking normal emotional responses. Some of them can even be ""too"" good and sometimes you can tell by them trying too hard. Those with Asperger's do that too but they are less successful<p>* A psychopath will easily switch on an off their ""social"" mode. Someone with Asperger's might not have the same level of control. A psychopath does not cultivate relationships with others because they deem themselves to be too good and superior and see it as a useless waste of time. But they could if they wanted to -- if it benefits them. You can spot these cases when someone is very friendly with their superior (the boss) but immediately switch and act a total dick for now reason at all to their peers or their inferiors.<p>* A person with Asperger's can be introspective. Can conduct self-analysis. They can have a low self-esteem and can be prone to depression. A psychopath will usually never see anything wrong with themselves.<p>* A psychopath will enjoy see others suffer for no reason at all. They would go out of their ways to hurt someone just to enjoy the effects.",1307829433

2644959,comment,2643671,2643731,3,0,pavpanchekha,,,"You know, I think part of the problem is that a lot of the leaders of the Linux desktop experience are building these large, complex structures and applications where they are not needed.  The best Linux desktop wouldn't be the one that solves all of our problems by specifically considering them, it'd be one that solves them by obviating them.<p>Now, I'll admit, I'm a minimalist.  I use Arch Linux, run no end-user applications except Emacs and Chrome (and I use w3m as the browser often enough), dwm for window manager, and so on.  But really it seems that the enormous complexity of these new solutions makes them near-impossible to support.  PulseAudio, PolicyKit --- all of these had working systems that were far, far simpler.  Maybe instead of PulseAudio, we needed to look at the ALSA code, clean it up, and add the few features people really cared about (per-application volume control) there.  Yes, the semantic desktop might be this great pie-in-the-sky result.  But really, too complex.  Unity, Gnome3?  Same thing.  We don't need Wayland, we need to simplify and clean up X.Org (something, admittedly, that /has/ been happening.  X.Org is the one of those software packages that /does/ improve monotonically with every release).  We don't need the total solution to all our problems.  We need to simplify and polish what we have now.",1307829084

2644953,comment,2640841,2643017,0,0,Klinky,,,"S&P, Fitch & Moodys didn't just sell their reputation for a ""few deals"". Pretty much every MBS or CDO was rated highly by these companies. Trillions of dollars worth. A large part of this is due to the fact that they are paid by the ""bad actors"" inside the investment firms & banks that they're suppose to be ""independently"" rating. If we banned that form of relationship that would be ""regulation"" which is ""bad"".<p>So, here we are with these same companies in charge of sovereign credit ratings. The same companies that played a large part in creating a credit crisis are the companies that get to set creditworthiness. Magnificent system we have.<p>So in order to make these credit rating agencies happy, we must deregulate further, lower taxes further, turn into a service level economy & freeze or depress wages so we can hope for short-term gains in our economy. Which makes corporations happy, banks happy & market makers happy thus our creditworthiness goes higher. It seems rather biased for those who are on top & those who caused the calamity in the first place. Once the economy stabilizes those smart rich people on top can start making imaginary investments with their friends until they create another crisis. Rinse & repeat.

This is all because of a lot of hard work putting bits on a server somewhere in Austin or something. People come from all over the world to consume content and buy things.<p>Aside from the legal discussion, in practical terms what part of this equation involves the state of Illinois? I don't mean to be facile, but looks to me like the only reason they're coming for the money <i>is because they can</i>. In any other scenario we'd call this a shakedown. But because politicians do it we call it policy. Weird.<p>I'm not by any means arguing for no government, just pointing out that most times when I pay a tax there's something concrete and direct in return. If I pay property taxes, it goes to the local school. If I pay a road toll, it goes for road maintenance. If I buy a fishing license, I pay for game inspectors. This payment and feedback loop allows me to be able to judge if a tax is working or not -- and form some kind of opinion about what rates might be best. Here I'm just paying the state because they have the power to hurt me if I don't pay them. Seems to me once you reach a certain point in decoupling taxes from benefits, there's no rational basis to have any kind of compromise any more. Instead you get these hugely polarized debates.

2644939,comment,2643671,2643731,3,0,chipsy,,,"I think part of the problem these days is that the most creative and innovative efforts are going towards the browser. And, indeed, if browsers keep growing and start to provide an credible, sandboxed,  near-native-app equivalent(e.g. pNaCl + local caching, low-level input, sound and video APIs and full network capabilities) the desktop could potentially be stripped all the way back to the programmer-and-sysadmin-centric environments we had in the mid-80s, and usability focus could be on supporting the browser experience instead, as ChromeOS is attempting.<p>As it is, the Linux desktop is still working towards ""yesterday's experience,"" since we don't have good enough browsers and there are tons and tons of legacy apps. Unfortunately, supporting yesterday's experience is harder for usability since it's conceptually richer, and most of these concepts are dueling at the bits-and-bytes level, where they're hard to reason about and present in digestible ways. The browser can blackbox a lot of stuff behind the standard APIs, something which the OS does not enjoy.<p>Another problem, just as large, is that there continues to be lots of new hardware, and correspondingly new drivers to support and specs to reverse engineer(since many manufacturers remain unwilling to assist). This is a problem that can only be solved by maintaining a hardware taskforce roughly proportional to the amount of new hardware released, but it's not particularly interesting or sexy, and it's not a core goal of most of the Linux ecosystem to create premium-grade drivers for all hardware.",1307828495

There are several statements made in the article that are incorrect, and then other arguments are based on them.<p>In particular, the tying together of speed and time.<p>""By 'world line' we mean a curve traced out in the four dimensions of space-time"". Time is not a dimension. Time is a human concept. Clocks don't measure a physical dimension or force called time, they repeat mechanical motions at regular intervals that we label as time passing. Same for atomic clocks. We measure the spin rates of cesium atoms but that isn't any different than mechanical clocks. Time is not a force that figures into physics equations.<p>Further, time doesn't exist. Not in the classical sense. What we experience as time is the entropy of energy in the universe winding out. We remember things that happened before and imagine things in the future, but since there is no physical ""time"" dimension there is no traveling forward and back.<p>If you are on a ship traveling close to c, the rate of entropy in the matter and energy on your ship is lower than the outside universe. That's why time seems slower.<p>There's a classic thought experiment that you can build a time machine by putting one end of a wormhole on a ship, send it out for 20 years near c, then bring it back. At this point you would have a wormhole with ends in two different times. It doesn't work like that though. Passing through it will just put you wherever it opens to, and you'll just end up in whatever local entropy rate is going on.",1307828390

Data entry may be easier/faster in a web-based UI with dropdowns, radio buttons, multi-select boxes, etc. It is also easier to delegate to untrusted or partially trusted users when you can control every option they have available to them. Ever tried to limit someone to only being able to modify <i>some</i> DNS records, but not others, using sudo and filesystem permissions?<p>A primary reason Webmin is web-based is that a web browser is always available. An ssh client may not be. We do have plans to create a ""webmin"" CLI tool, at some point in the future, that does the same thing for Webmin that the virtualmin and cloudmin tools to...though that's a trickier business since Webmin isn't really like either of those tools, and is a lot more open-ended in its purpose and capabilities.<p>But, sure, command line tools are awesome, and Webmin doesn't prevent you from hitting the command line when you want to.

Most software patents I read consist of ""apply <canned algorithm x> to <situation y>"".  This one doesn't read like that.  I think it's very important that this patent is pure fluff - it does not actually keep you from producing a good product in any given field.<p>The patent was filed in 2006.  From my recollection, I can't think of any websites or devices that used this sort of feature before 2006.  Today it seems fairly common, but in tech people are so used to blindly copying features (because its so easy to do after someone else has already done all the research) that I can't rightly say this innovation didn't originate with the inventor.  All the devices used by potential infringers involving this patent existed for years prior to the filing of this patent, which to me says its not as easy to dismiss as obvious.<p>The patent was also created by someone who seems to be focused on inventing things.  People rail against software trolls because they don't produce an actual product, but if the inventor could not license or sell this patent, this fairly common feature might not exist today.<p>Because of all the above, this isn't a patent I would point to as an example of why we need to abolish software patents.

It used to require an additional ~11MB for the data gathering cron jobs, backup cron jobs, etc. but now it runs most of those tasks within the Webmin application service process and so only increases usage slightly during those tasks.<p>If that's too much, you don't need to use it. (You could shut it down when you're not using it, though it loses a lot of its utility when it can't communicate with your slave DNS servers, keep resource usage data, etc.)<p>Virtualmin is a more complicated beast, and can take quite a bit more memory, if caching is enabled, but that is optional, and when disabled it takes the same ~11MB as Webmin.",1307826712

The mathematical model of SR (smooth manifold with static metric (and we know that our real world doesn't have static metric, so real applications of SR approximate it by considering only sufficiently local regions of space during short periods of time)) doesn't cover and thus doesn't preclude or contradict with other types of relative  ""motions"" (for the lack of better term) which are known to exist and have speed faster  than ""c"" :<p>- quantum entanglement (we don't know the machinery behind it, very-very possible that the SR's smoothness of space  is also only a rough approximation of the real world.) Obviously any attempts to find the ""signal"" between the entangled particles in the conventional  sense (something traveling through smooth static spacetime) have so far been and will continue to be futile.<p>- relative motion of the parts of the (our expanding) Universe that are far enough from each other (observed, space expansion, described by General Relativity, at this scales of spacetime the  SR's condition of static metric just isn't valid anymore  )",1307826279
2644853,comment,2644338,2644831,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm not going to argue that everyone should use Virtualmin or any other control panel, and I'm sure if I were trying to fit my websites into a 64MB system I wouldn't be using a control panel. But, I do want to mention that Virtualmin itself can be configured to use approximately 11MB of RAM (though it is an application server that can cache libraries and modules, and can be as much as ~130MB, with about 20MB resident, in a large system with all caching features enabled). The services being managed are, by <i>far</i>, the biggest consumers of resources.<p>You can no more build a full-featured virtual hosting stack with email (and spam/AV scanning), web, databases, mod_fcgid or fastcgi with suexec, DNS, etc. in 64MB without a control panel than you could with a control panel. Likewise, if you just want web service, you can build one with Virtualmin in X+11 MB of RAM (where X is the amount of RAM the system and web server require).<p>Of course, Virtualmin (or cPanel or Plesk) are not targeted to very small deployments. They're for shared hosting, which tends to be on a larger system where a few MB for the control panel is of negligible impact.<p>I just want it to be clear that ""control panel == memory hog"" is not really accurate. It's probably all the stuff that users expect from a control panel-equipped system that makes it require more memory. ClamAV, for instance, requires more than 200MB. MySQL for a single moderately popular website can consume 300MB. Apache can grow as big as your imagination, because there are so many modules people can enable. A thoroughly stripped Apache isn't all that big, but the average Apache process is a couple hundred MB.",1307826245

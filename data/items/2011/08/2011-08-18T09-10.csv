The idea is that since buyer and seller are in the same university, they'll just transact face-to-face.<p>2. I don't actually know the name of the textbooks for e.g COFA0217 unless the user enters it into the form. e.g. <a href=""http://textbookcentral.com.au/26/university-of-new-south-wales/buy/69897/acct1501/?query="" rel=""nofollow"">http://textbookcentral.com.au/26/university-of-new-south-wal...</a><p>If they do enter it into the form and I become the other side of the transaction, it'll be very expensive. Textbooks here cost $100 each. I'll have to make at least a $20 loss for each transaction.<p>What I need is more students looking for textbooks online, and I guess doing this will help. But matching a request/offer costs $20 in loss for the book (If you're buying a used textbook you're looking for at least a 20% discount), plus labor required to get the textbook.<p>Is a freelancer really going to be able to find a used textbook worth $80, send it to me, for the price $80? Also, I still have to send the book to the buyer/seller. This might sound suspicious; if I did the course why do I have to send it and not just meet at university? There will also be some students who receive the book by mail and not pay me, and I'll have to take the loss for that. (i.e I can do this for my university only.)<p>So the only way out is to change my website so I can use the tactic you described. That would be like changing it to the model of textbook.com, where they have an existing inventory and make dough from the margin between buyers and sellers.<p>I don't want to handle such a big business yet.

I wonder if it would be possible to detect this sort of thing: implementing some sort of checksum on the content they send out and checking it with client-side script to tell the user that the page had been modified. It would flag up changes some users are expecting (from deliberately written/installed add-ons or greasemnokey scripts, and would not be able to identify the source of the change, so it wouldn't be perfect. And of course add-ins changing the page could just remove the checking code - but that would be a nice big red sign to say <i>never trust a line of code released by this company/person again</i> and would be an arms race (though Google probably has the resources to keep the upper hand in that).",1313661319

Liquidity premium theory<p>The Liquidity Premium Theory is an offshoot of the Pure Expectations Theory. The Liquidity Premium Theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields, and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher not just because of the liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory:",1313660368

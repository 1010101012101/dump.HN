2648327,comment,2647924,2648071,8,0,dkarl,,,"Same here.  I'm getting more and more bored with it.  What was most interesting about Facebook for me was learning about certain people.  This guy I work with likes cheesy movies, goes out to Irish bars with his wife, and likes to tweet quotes from whatever movie he's watching when he's drunk.  Learning that was interesting.  Seeing the same pattern every day is horribly boring.  Same thing with most of my high-volume friends.  A close high school friend's wife, whom I haven't had a chance to get to know in person, loves mariachi music, can't write a coherent sentence to save her life, goes to la pulga (the flea market) every weekend, enjoys drama with her coworkers, and is constantly sharing coupon deals.  Fascinating to know, boring as shit to see every day.<p>And of course the highest volume people are the most boring.  All my friends seem to have about the same volume of inanity, funny stuff, somewhat interesting comments, worthwhile content, and vital life updates to share.  They just vary in what their sharing threshold is.  If I could tune out everything below ""worthwhile content"" then Facebook would be great.  I'd also only need to look at it once a day for two minutes to keep up with everybody.  Alas, there is no ""setLogLevel"" method on my Facebook feed.",1307947222

They are sinful, greedy, duplicitous, violent, irrational, and destructive.<p>The claims that the concerns about human caused significant global warming are just a flim flam fraud are just deceptions of the Devil.<p>(2) Evil humans are destroying the planet, the 100% all-natural, delicate, sensitive, pure, pristine, precious environment.<p>The weather was never like this before evil humans started working with the bow and arrow.<p>(3) For this evil transgression, humans will be made to suffer terrible retribution of extreme weather, failed crops, farms and forests turned into deserts, lowlands flooded, cute, cuddly, sweet, pure white baby polar bears drowning in the ice-free Arctic, penguins starving, and worse.  The whales will die, and when the whales die, the oceans will die and then we will die, and the whales are starting to die.<p>(4) For this retribution, humans need redemption or death from their sin, evil, and transgressions.  The only possible redemption is sacrifice.  We have to start by giving up computers, telephones, airplanes, plastics, TV, yes, even including the soaps, electric power, cars, frozen foods, and McDonald's French fries.  Then we must give up synthetic fabrics, permanent press, washing machines, paper plates, deodorant, and women's bras and panties.<p>Humans must abstain from sex.<p>But this will not be enough, not nearly enough:  The sun is about to stop moving across the sky, and the only solution is to have a holy Mayan priest hold ceremonies pouring the blood of evil humans on a sacred rock.  The only qualified priest is Saint Laureate Al Guru aided by the dedicated, devoted Guru Acolytes lead by Sister Laurie.<p>The blood will come from sacrificing virgins (when they first arrived at the ceremony with Saint Guru).<p>Only in this way, along with Cap and Trade and the EPA, can the planet be saved.",1307945914

They may not generalize.<p>My thought is that short methods make your code more <i>flexible</i>  that is, you can compose the pieces of it in more ways, so the next bit of code you write without modifying the existing code can be shorter  at the cost of comprehensibility and verifiability.  It's no surprise that this value came out of the Smalltalk camp, because Smalltalk (and OO in general, but especially Smalltalk) is optimized for flexibility at the expense of verifiability.<p>When you factor out a method, you're making the code you pulled it out of easier to read  except when the reader needed to know the details of what you pulled out.  But you're making the code you pulled out harder to read, because the reader no longer knows that it's called in only one place, what the state of the system is when it's called, what the values of its arguments are, and what its results are used for.<p>There was once a school of thought that it's easier to read a piece of code if it's laid out to visually show the tree structure of its loops and conditionals, and if it uses loops and conditionals instead of gotos.  I think this is not the only virtue that code can possess that helps its readability, but it is a real virtue.  Factoring out more methods reduces this virtue, so it needs to be repaid by some other virtue, which I think is what you're saying.<p>I have several different heuristics for when it's good to factor out methods or functions, but I think they aren't good enough, because I always end up with some functions that are kind of a mess.",1307944835

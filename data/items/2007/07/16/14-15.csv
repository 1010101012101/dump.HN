Later you can do your own project and add the advantage of a superior language to the advantage of knowing what a successful startup looks like.",1184597863

There are other startups, and of course you could always do your own thing and pick your tools.<p>This isn't to say that C++ is necessarily bad, but I wouldn't want to work in it (again) either.",1184596962

Two <i>excellent</i> presentations on these lines:<p><a href=""http://www.okananter.com/wordpress/?p=21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.okananter.com/wordpress/?p=21</a><p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/140</a><p>As for marketing to the poor, I don't follow your reasoning.  It strikes me as obvious that it's easier and a better ROI to make money from those who have some to spare than from those who don't.  As currently underdeveloped countries get richer, more people will try and sell to them.<p>Are you talking about <i>positioning</i> now so you'll reap the rewards when these countries get richer?  That's not making money on the poor; it's investing money on advertising to them so you can hopefully get it back when they get rich enough to be potential customers.  I wonder how many of the people in the position to make such a decision will look that far into the future.  They should be looking to maximize shareholder value, and who invests looking for a ROI event 50 years from now?<p>[Edit: Of course I see why serving this market would be motivating, and I'm not saying it can't be profitable.] ",1184596336

A compiler is a tool.  A language is the actual medium that a programmer works in.  It will effect every aspect of a software project, including the way in which the programmers think.",1184595897

Now, do some quick research and figure out how much time/energy they spent on a big-bang launch to ""release"" their product to the world.""",1184594665

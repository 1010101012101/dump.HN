Coccinelle had to develop a swat of parsers for its project, and the Google project is using Clang as a basis for structural and semantic capabilities. C and C++, with their fragile type systems, preprocessor, horribly hard to parse syntax, might be the worse languages amongst typed languages to develop such projects on. And in spite of that, they are the ones for which such project exist, because they are the one with enough need for such tools.<p>Of course some languages are more amenable to such tools than others. Very strong static typing and a solid package system helps a lot. No metaprogramming helps too (because you don&#x27;t have to handle the transformation).<p>I&#x27;m working on such tools for Ada, that is pretty much the perfect language for this as far as imperative languages go. The essential need for such tools is to have a compiler that exposes some services as an API, most notably the ability to explore the AST and query cross references for language entities.

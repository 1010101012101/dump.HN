6139288,comment,6136863,6137847,14,0,harrytuttle,,,"Hmm. As someone who&#x27;s had to run a massive IIS cluster over the last 3-4 years, I disagree. It&#x27;s obtuse, unreliable, incredibly overcomplicated and regularly just fucks you because it can.<p>Some things that are utterly broken that really shouldn&#x27;t be that have cost me literally DAYS.<p>1. Using IIS ARR to proxy subversion = hell. The moment someone requests a web.config file from the back end SVN server via the IIS front end, it shits a brick. You have to piss around in the applicationHost.config to fix this.<p>2. It knackers XML encoding transparently inside ARR somehow resulting in clients losing requests as they come down as application/octet-stream rather than what you sent them as. This breaks lots of clients randomly.<p>2. Wildcard SSL domains i.e. star.whatever.com. If you delete one site instance, it kills all the others completely dead and you can&#x27;t re-add the certificate on the others: you have to create new site instances again from scratch. Workaround: stop a site instance and leave it there to rot forever. That&#x27;s fine but we can have up to 100 instances on a cluster.<p>3. Thread reuse. Each module (in integrated mode) can run in a different thread so it knackers thread local variables like the current culture and identity system in .Net. This is an absolute fucker to debug as it only happens under heavy load and is barely documented.<p>4. Sometimes servers in our cluster randomly just stop for a few seconds for no apparent reason (7.5 on 2008 R2). Our phones start ringing then. We&#x27;ve had Microsoft working on a fix for over a year and even they can&#x27;t work out why it&#x27;s happening. They admit it is IIS that is doing it.<p>5. Deployment hell. You&#x27;re supposed to be able to just &quot;xcopy&quot; deploy everything because it uses some mish-mash of shadow copies but occasionally this screws up and leaves an older dll in the ASP.Net Temporary Files folder which means your site suddenly has broken code contracts everywhere and your site goes down big time with YSOD (as even the error pages fall over) until someone fires up the magic &quot;fix it quick&quot; powershell script which cleans out all the crud, redeploys and restarts the cluster. That&#x27;s fine but we have 16 front end IIS servers and 80 million requests a day so this means trouble for us.<p>6. IIS Express and Visual Studio integration is just shit. It doesn&#x27;t work with source control software at all leading to constant problems when people do updates. The only solution is to shut everything down, delete the IISExpress directory in your documents folder and try again.<p>7. The whole dynamic vs static thing falls over when you have a module which rewrites static URLs. Everything has to run through the dynamic then. The coupling internally for features like this is terrible.<p>It&#x27;s stuff like that which means it&#x27;s still a broken pile of crap that I hate more and more every day.<p>For reference, we moved ALL of our development stuff over to an Apache mod_proxy setup with LDAP / AD integration and <i>it just works</i>. We&#x27;d love to do it with the front end but we can&#x27;t for obvious reasons...",1375347340

If they like the app, they might make the personal recommendation to their &quot;connections&quot; where price is less sensitive.<p>After a while, that social proof and networking effect wears off and it&#x27;s time to reset the price down to the &quot;discovery amount&quot; of $0.99.<p>To be honest, I&#x27;d love to flip SnappyCam over to freemium; but I feel that can&#x27;t happen until the social sharing is bolted in and the app has a chance to sell itself organically.",1375344357
6139167,comment,6138409,6139028,6,0,angersock,,,"Elaborating on the OO bit, as derefr did an excellent job of talking about the usefulness of function pointers in a VM.<p>So, let&#x27;s say I have a structure which I will use to represent objects in my game:<p><pre><code>  typedef void (*thinkfunc_t)(void* self, unsigned int dt);\n\n  typedef struct BaseFoo {\n    float x,y,z;\n    thinkfunc_t doThink;\n  } BaseFoo;\n\n  void null_think(void* self, unsigned int dt) { return 0; } /* empty think function */\n\n  BaseFoo* Foo_new() {\n    BaseFoo* ret;\n    ret = calloc(1,sizeof(BaseFoo));\n    ret->doThink = null_think;\n    return ret;\n  }\n\n  BaseFoo* Foo_clone( BaseFoo* foo) {\n    BaseFoo* ret;\n    ret = Foo_new();\n    memmove( ret, foo, sizeof(BaseFoo) );\n    return ret;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo, if I want to create a new BaseFoo, I just call Foo_new() and I&#x27;m off to the races; I get back a Foo object that, during my update loop, I can fiddle with:<p><pre><code>  /* update loop snipped for brevity */\n  BaseFoo* currentFoo;\n  currentFoo = get_my_foo_from_my_big_foo_list();\n  currentFoo->doThink(currentFoo, getFrameTimeInMilliseconds());\n</code></pre>\nSo, that&#x27;s kind of cool, but what if I want to create a new, better foo, that actually moves? I do this:<p><pre><code>  void move_think(void* self, unsigned int dt) {\n    BaseFoo* foo = (BaseFoo*) self;\n    foo->x += dt;\n    foo->y += dt;\n    foo->z += dt;\n    return 0;\n  }\n\n  typedef BaseFoo MovingFoo;\n\n  MovingFoo* MovingFoo_new() {\n    MovingFoo* ret;\n    ret = Foo_new();\n    ret->doThink = move_think;\n    return ret;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo, this is very bland, but it gets across the idea that function pointers let me easily override member methods on class instances. You can imagine that, with a little cleverness, you can store arbitrary data into the struct, along with a table of function pointers to instance methods (a virtual function table).<p>This is a very fun, very deep rabbit hole.<p>In a lot of ways, you basically fake the type of prototypical inheritance you&#x27;d expect from, say, JavaScript.<p>EDIT:<p>Elaborating on another point--it&#x27;s very common to use function pointers in a struct that then gets filled out by a dll or shared library.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say that I&#x27;ve got a renderer that draws 3D stuff and conforms to an API. At runtime, I check what driver the user wants to use (software renderer, Direct3D, or OpenGL), and then I fill out the function pointers of that structure to point at the architecture and driver-specific methods I&#x27;d like to use.<p>The rest of my code doesn&#x27;t change, because it only ever calls the interface exposed by the structure--the actual addresses pointed to by the function pointers are irrelevant.",1375344325

6139165,comment,6115727,6131202,2,0,beagle3,,,"> The database equivalent of maintaining order for every single-column selection is to have per-column indices.<p>I guess that&#x27;s where the misunderstanding comes. In K/APL, every column has an implicit &quot;natural index&quot; - the first item has index 0, the second item has index 1, etc. The thing that is always guaranteed is that, in a result set, the natural indices of the different columns of the same tuple correspond.<p><i>Some</i> operations guarantee a particular natural index order, but many do not. An additional index on the values that allows you to find an exact value (e.g. hash) or range of values (e.g. a b-tree) may or may not exist, just like in a relational database.<p>This &quot;natural implicit index&quot; does not take memory or anything to maintain, but it is useful.<p>> Try that in production on a busy OLTP system and let me know how you go.<p>ksql runs my queries approximately 100 times faster than optimized MySQL (using MyISAM - faster, but no acid guarantees; ksql is acid).<p>> Incidentally, I don&#x27;t see why you think the tax-bracket thing is such a killer case. Oh noes, a small join!<p>That was just for known terminology, not knowing where you come from. I have tables with thousands of such brackets. And while I haven&#x27;t tried Oracle or MS-SQL for them since 2006 or so, it was incredibly easy to confuse their optimizer into doing a complete cross product on those tables and filter it - which makes it takes a second per query instead of milliseconds when the query is optimized properly (or microseconds using K).<p>This is known as an &quot;as-of&quot; join in time-series queries, and any database without explicit support for it usually takes thousands of times more resources than needed for such a join.",1375344261

6139159,comment,6136901,6138116,2,0,vsbuffalo,,,"I completely agree. I work in plant sciences (as a bioinformatician) but my background is in econ, pol sci, and stats. Unless things have changed since I switched fields, most global food security problems are market related. There&#x27;s more than enough food, and we&#x27;re really good at getting it all around the globe quickly. Also, huge amounts of food are lost due to post-harvest losses. I&#x27;d bet a beer that in terms of absolute food weight to mouths, post-harvest research may have higher benefit/cost ratio than photosynthesis research. Evolution has been pretty damn good at getting photosynthesis as efficient as possible (read R. Ford Denison&#x27;s Book <i>Darwinian Agriculture</i> for this point argued well).<p>Having experience in both fields, I don&#x27;t work in plant genomics because I want to feed more people (I do, but if that&#x27;s what solely motivated me I&#x27;d be working under economics still). I do it because genetics is awesome, and plants are great to study.<p>But, I&#x27;d argue that the hard sciences are always a good worth investing in. Being capable of trying to understand our world with the scientific method is something that is uniquely human. We should use this talent as much as possible. Drosophila (fruit fly) genetics is a great example. Decades ago, drosophila was chosen because it was cheap to grow in a lab and had a short generation time. Yet through drosophila we&#x27;ve learned so much about genetics, development, and evolution in ways that are just unparalleled. Yet Sarah Palin[1] and others attack it as a silly waste of money. If we&#x27;d have limited drosophila research decades ago because we didn&#x27;t think an organism with a ~700 million year split with humans would be useful for us, where would be? Much stupider, and much worse off. Basic science matters, big time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCXqKEs68Xk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCXqKEs68Xk</a>",1375344150

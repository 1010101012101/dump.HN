895597,comment,895512,895512,0,0,sachinag,,,"One piece of feedback: we've found that buyers don't think in ranges; they think in terms of budgets.  If my budget is $10,000, I don't just want to see the $3K-$10K range; I'd want to see all the designers under $10K, so that I'd see the under $3K and the $3K-$10K group all at once.<p>EDIT: Second piece of feedback: you should add a ""see other designers like this"" on the page.  For example, for <a href=""http://haystack.com/company/161-right-sizer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haystack.com/company/161-right-sizer</a>, there should be a link to see all other Chicago designers under $3K.

895596,comment,894509,894988,0,0,scott_s,,,"Hmm. It doesn't really ""simplify"" locking. In does in the simple case of:<p><pre><code>  lock();\n  ++value;\n  unlock();\n</code></pre>\nWhere a lock is used to protect a single memory location, and the critical section is straight-line code. But when the critical section is more involved, CAS based algorithms become considerably more complicated. CAS based algorithms which do not require mutual exclusion are called ""lock-free algorithms,"" and reasoning about them is hard.<p>The wiki for it is a good start: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_synchronization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_synchronization</a> And I'm going to go ahead and plug the work I've done in the area: <a href=""http://people.cs.vt.edu/~scschnei/streamflow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cs.vt.edu/~scschnei/streamflow/</a>",1256158670

I know I want an iPhone app; I come across <a href=""http://www.flingmedia.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flingmedia.com/</a>, and the contact us form gives me his rates.  Then you try to see if Brian's rates are valid; the pricing itself gives a marker of credibility.  If Brian's rates are in line with what I see elsewhere, and his portfolio seems directionally suggestive enough that he can build what he says he can build, at the very least, I'm going to contact him.  The conversation with Brian will tell me, as a client, if he'd be good to work with.  Sure, it takes more work - you can't make judgments based so heavily on portfolios - but I really think Haystack would be really helpful to both clients and developers.  (So, please, add developers!)<p>Semi-related, I'll bet you a dollar that people will be looking for local designers before they look at portfolios (rather than starting with portfolios) because you give them that option.

A serious student will pick it up pretty quickly but .<p>The larger issue is that the lack of a central documentation + discussion hub means that there's no system taking the informal knowledge possessed by discrete practitioners -- stuff like what implementations of what functions on which platforms have unanticipated quirks, or what function non-newbies typically use instead of the function you're currently reading the docs for -- and capturing it for posterity in an easily-searchable format.<p>Some of that information can be gleaned from usenet and mailing list archives if you know to search there and have time to wade through flames and trolls and other gunk, but the rest of it is stuck in the minds of individuals and is therefore largely inaccessible.<p>The php approach (which is used by other projects, like eg mysql and pgsql) of having a central online documentation area with integrated user comments is that it provides a natural place for such informal knowledge to wind up; once it's there once it's there for everyone (and can be googled and so on).<p>You could create an in-environment system that had most of these advantages -- some ""social"" version of the docs, essentially a wiki-ish system -- but that's hypothetical, and I'm talking concretely, and concretely the available common lisp documentation is largely outclassed by the documentation available for php (and for python, and java, and c#, and many others).<p>As a parting note you really shouldn't underestimate the advantage of dumping more information into a single page.<p>Much of the useful knowledge about a language and its core libraries is knowing the logical structure of how everything fits together; much of this is never documented in any formal way, but can be inferred from an overview of the larger-scale organization.<p>When you present stuff all on one page it's pretty easy to take this in: notice how quickly you could tell the php strings api was poorly designed? That's b/c you could at a glance see everything that was relevant and infer the entire structure (or lack thereof).<p>When you present things in tiny little atomized chunks it requires much more effort for the reader to get the birds-eye view of the system, as the reader is not provided the convenience of seeing it all laid out in one place.",1256156254

I have to agree, a comparison here is 4-doublings of processor power, meaning Windows 7 can be 16 times more CPU intensive than XP and appear to be the same speed, because it still only occupies say 5% of the total CPU usage.<p>The comparison here is between the Model T and a new Mustang, not between a '02 model and a 2010 model.",1256156096

Instead of helping to solve your problem, advocates (and the reference documents, ""tutorials"") want to engage in academic chest beating exercises.<p>How hard is it just to acknowledge, just a teeny bit, that PHP is more successuful than Lisp for real reasons -- not just because everyone but you is an idiot.  That's nice that you think the string library is appalling.  Perhaps it is -- but jesus, how do you even get work done with an attitude like that?  Do you write everything you do from scratch?<p>Go write a graduate paper on the perfect string library and others can get real work done.",1256156084

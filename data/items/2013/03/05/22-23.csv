Essentially, start simple and stay there, the problems, the mess, the mythical-man-months, etc all come because the developers refused the effort needed for simple and impatiently descended into the swamp of complexity.<p>I too, love starting simple and usually intend to stay there.<p>But the problem I would suggest, is the complexity will build up and simplity-as-the-simple-methods you've learned, simplity-as-such, can't fight this build-up. <i>If being simple COULD put an end to complex situations, you wouldn't have to START simple, you could use simplicity to ""drain the swamp of the complex"".</i> But every methodology more or less says that you have to be on the top of its mountain and to stay there (except original OO and we know how well that worked).<p>My contention is that this ""mountain dwelling"" is only possible at times, in some domains, in some organizations, etc. Humans can, at times, carve simplicity out of the swamp of complexity. But it isn't easy and it isn't a product of any fixed set of simple tools we human have come up with so-far.<p>Mr. Hickey's viewpoint might be useful for selling simplicity and I would be willing to use it if I thought simplicity would be a good buy for my organization. But the reality is tradeoffs never good away. Sometimes people overestimate the value of short term payoff but sometimes people overestimate the value of long term payoffs. The one thing that I think I want to keep here is the clear, simple distinction between ""ease"" and ""simplicity"". It's useful even if it might not be entirely, true.",1362524034

The company is still going (and quite successfully I might proudly add).<p>There are many start-up companies over there across all industries. There isn't really a clique/community like there seems to be in San Fran, Sydney (my home town) etc. Founders just start up out of opportunity and need.<p>There are also open desk places for start-ups. A lot of that seems to be mainly occupied by creative design companies. In saying that I think you'll find most start-ups are not tech based.<p>If you'd like to know more shoot through some specific questions and I'll see if I can help you or even introduce you to the appropriate people.<p>--<p>I seem to not have answered your question with the above.<p>If you are eligible for a work visa get it before heading over.  A common way to get a work visa if your two countries don't have a working holiday visa agreement is to apply for an English teaching role in your home country and then when you enter the country use that work visa to springboard into another job (note: this normally means you have to teach English for several months which can be hell if you don't like that sort of thing).<p>Already having a job ready for you when you arrive is the best way but highly unlikely a start-up is going to go through the process of sponsorship for your visa.<p>If you have 100K to spare you can go over there establish your own company and then sponsor yourself. You can then pay yourself an annual salary of 100K and get that money back. Little bit dodgy but within the law. At least the way I did it was!<p>Expect to get 200,000-300,000yen/month for a real beginning of the journey start-up company. If it already has a steady and growing revenue stream then you can probably negotiate higher.<p>If you are open to one-step-above-a-backpacker's-hostel living arrangements I suggest you get a room with SakuraHouse (if you plan to stay in Tokyo -- also advised if you want to work in a start-up). As it is cheap and easy to cancel the contract. Once you get a feel for the place then look to set up more permanent digs. Also look through the classifieds on www.metropolis.co.jp which is a local rag for foreigners living in Tokyo (you probably want to do the whole complete Japanese immersion thing but finding a Japanese sharehouse will be more difficult than a foreign sharehouse).<p>Winter is feezing, Summer is humid.

This particularly shows in Miguels great essay ""Let's make Unix not suck"".<p>And the Mac achieves 2/3 of that. It made Unix not suck. It provides most of the open source goodies on top (using something like brew). And it also provides the kind of proprietary software that simply can't be matched by available open source software (like most of the Adobe tools).<p>Although I can sense some bitterness in his recent essays, he simply acknowledges the fact that the classic Linux desktop won't make it. (However I think it may actually succeed even on the desktop in the form of something Android related.)<p>As I see it, there will be a peaceful coexistence of proprietary and free software. Free software succeeds a) where collaboration is needed (Webkit) and b) to provide the kind of pluggable modules that OO programming promised to deliver but never did.

My own code is full of immutable data-structures, except in instances in which I have to process stuff returned by Java libraries and even in those cases I wrap them in Scala's immutable interfaces (note, I'm talking about Scala and not Haskell only because it's the language I know).<p>The only problem is that many times you need <i>mutable references</i> to immutable data-structures,  with no easy way out and this is where you can still have problems with side-effects and multi-threading. But dealing with such references is easier, because (a) you tend to do it less and less often and (b) you can use STM or just plain atomic references or @volatiles, as in many instances you need to just ensure the <i>visibility</i> of updates and you only really need locks only on writes. Also, I tend to encapsulate and hide really well pieces of code that deal with mutability.<p>A good standard library of immutable data-structures is very practical for day to day use. I wasn't talking about immutable data-structures though, as the data-structures themselves are only a small part of the puzzle. Much more difficult is to deal with inter-modules communications, processing streams of data, I/O and stuff like that.

220267,story,,,28,52,huhtenberg,"Firefox 3 smart bar is just too smart",,"[ <i>I don't have a blog, so I'll rant here instead</i> ]<p>FF3 came out today and I followed the crowd and upgraded to it. Within 5 minutes it became obvious that I passionately hated new ""smart bar"" feature.<p>A smaller thing was that it wasted tons of screen real estate and just didn't look esthetically pleasing. It rendered auto-complete items in two lines. It also made the whole list look like an Xmas tree with its liberal use of fonts, bolding and favicons. Apparently this particular ""improvement"" was so good that the FF3 devs removed a setting for disabling it from the about:config page. One now has to resort to using an add-on called ""oldbar"" instead. This made the suggestions list far more compact and it looked way cleaner and more usable.<p>However a far more annoying change was how smartbar populated the list. It matched what I typed not just to <i>the head</i> of the old URLs, but to any part in them. And to the bookmarks. And to the bookmark descriptions. And the page titles.<p>So typing ""news"" no longer brought up a list of news.ycombinator.com, news1130.com, etc, but rather slashdot.org (News for Nerds), digg.com (All News, Videos ..) and some other obscure URLs that I didn't even remember visiting. They say it learns and will eventually put most relevant URLs at the top of the list. Great, thanks. This just solved a problem that I didn't have to begin with. And it all would've been well, but here's a kicker - YOU CANNOT DISABLE THIS.<p>This leads me to the reason why I decided to make this post. This situation is a good example of how <i>not</i> to approach adding features to the application.<p>1. New features and behavioral patterns. These can be the defaults for new installs and this should gradually migrate everyone to the new feature set. However users arriving to a new version via an upgrade path should have their experience preserved as intact as possible.<p>2. Replacing features instead of adding them. You can bet that there are users that explicitly depend on existing behavior and taking it away is a big deal.<p>FF does not conform to these principles. Also by looking at the Mozilla forums it is obvious that the devs were aware of the problems these changes created, but decided to ignore them. Too bad really. It's not like it would've been too much work to handle these changes a bit more gracefully.<p>/eor",1213743362

220249,comment,220133,220133,0,0,olavk,,,"I get really annoyed by the recurring CSS vs. tables debates, because they seem to be so dogmatic and often based on misunderstandings of CSS.<p>CSS was initially designed to support every kind of typography or layout which was achievable using presentational HTML. It was rightly recognized that if some effects (no matter how ill-advised) were only possible using presentational markup, people would not migrate to CSS. This is the reason properties like ""blink"" were included in CSS.<p>Regarding table-like layouts, the corresponding CSS property is called ""display:table"", and was included in the CSS 2.0 standard 10 years ago.<p>IE however did not and does still not support ""display:table"". Therefore there is no direct CSS alternative to table-layouts which works cross-browser.<p>A table-like layout can still with some effort be emulated by pushing other CSS features like floats to the limits. But this is actually misusing these CSS construct for a purpose they were never intended for, which makes it generally convoluted and inflexible compared to ""just using tables"".<p>But it is important to realize that the problems with the CSS approach is not that CSS is badly designed - or requires a fundamentally different mindset - but simply that the implementation in IE is incomplete.<p>One should also realize that tables are superior only in some specific circumstances (as described in the article). Generally CSS is better and easier to use for layout, even considering the omissions in IE.",1213742602

Does a static HTML file filled with tables for layout obscure the semantics for things like screen-readers?  Sure.<p>Does any of that have anything to do with whether or not a table should be used for layout?  Not that I can see.  Two or three lines of jQuery will pack those divs into your table by class.<p>The weirdest part of all of this is the idea that CSS is ""just as good"" for typical layout tasks.  Not only is it not as good, it's a near-disaster.  Nothing works right, ever.  It's <i>never</i> possible to just say ""line these elements up and put these others to their side"" without jumping through awful hoops.

But the reality is moving away from tables for your layout will make your site more malleable and easy to maintain the future. It doesn't always mean crazy i.e. only clauses in your css either. see: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=219809"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=219809</a>",1213740350

It's also amazing to see how much 'dressing up' simple machineries need, in order to be attractive. Taken in the opposite light, however, this also shows that to build something good, you often don't need very sophisticated mechanisms inside.",1213740202

I meant to ask, is it always important enough to justify all the extra cost associated with it?<p>It's presented as this cardinal rule: the web designer shalt not mix layout and content, nor shall the designer obfuscate thy code with any table, less it is presented in the form of a database view. (+1 for dramatic license.)<p>And I would be all for that, IF the development platform that we were all forced to use actually supported that in a helpful way.<p>But, it doesn't. Give me a little time, and I'm pretty sure I can come up with at least one presentational trick that is absolutely, positively impossible with cross-browser CSS -- and I'll even allow you to use all the CSS hacks you can come up with. But, the very same presentational effect is a piece of cake with a single HTML table.<p>MVC, or MVP, are sound ideas ... where they're made practical by the development environment. However, it's possible to write perfectly easy-to-maintain code for a business without strictly following those models, and if you're dealing with some framework or development environment that makes the MVC model difficult, then I think it's foolhardy not to make some practical considerations in lieu of this stainless ideal.<p>EDIT: I just remembered the CSS layout that I wanted so badly and never could figure out. It drove me nuts, but this was a couple of years ago and somebody might have figured it out since. All I wanted was two columns; first was completely liquid, the second was liquid with a minimum width; auto scroll bars (but not displayed unless necessary); and -- the part I couldn't get to work -- a single line border drawn between the two. For some reason, no matter what I tried, introducing that line border caused one browser or another to add scrollbars, or draw it short, or something else idiotic. Three days of Googling, CSS hackery, and other nonsense later, and I wrote a table in just about a minute that did the job fine.",1213740152

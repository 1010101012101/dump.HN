30486,comment,30477,30477,0,0,staunch,,,"I think this is where the non-hacker founder can get completely trounced by a hacker-founder.<p>As smart as the guy is, Reid Hoffman has dragged his feet on letting people insert third party applications even since MySpace widgets started exploding. I don't think he really gets the leverage these platforms give a programmer, because he's not one.<p>Hoffman was also an investor and on the board of Friendster. Another company that totally missed the boat on becoming a social platform.<p>Now perhaps he finally is starting to get it. Too bad he's not a hacker and is therefore at the mercy of his development team, which is going to need 9 months to release anything.",1182760238

If a baseball coach tells his players that the most common type of hit is a base hit, that doesn't mean he would not prefer them to hit home runs as often as possible.",1182760157
30484,comment,30387,30468,0,0,pg,,,"Our general rule is, if you don't have any graphic design sense (and only about 10% of founders do), just make the site as sparse as possible.  Worked for Google.<p>In at least one case (reddit), the founders had a great sense of design and yet chose to make the site sparse anyway.  This was because as a news site they wanted to emphasize the information on the page and make the site itself fade into the background.",1182759053

A good boss doesn't micro-manage or tell you what to do: she lets you arrange your time as necessary to accomplish your objectives and exercise a lot of discretion about your day-to-day work.  However, she doesn't let you just spin your wheels and not accomplish anything either.  She provides just enough guidance to ensure that you're still moving forwards without dictating <i>how</i> you move forwards.<p>A good parent is very similar.  He provides structure and direction, but lets the child discover his/her own interests and pursue them.

I'm starting to think that this might be <i>the</i> central problem in NLP right now.<p>Humans have good natural pattern-matching engines in their heads, but the entire body of syntax and vocabulary available to a person is the result of the memorization of a <i>huge</i> amount of text. I suspect the majority of people rarely ever develop truly novel words or phrases on their own (with the notable exception of Lewis Carroll). (Aside: in fact, this is exactly how ""memes"" work in the modern online sense; one person invents a novel word or phrase, and that is then parroted by a huge number of other people.)<p>I recently started work on an attempt to improve the classification of English vocabulary by grade level. I built a database using publicly-available sources, and the number of unique words that the average child has been exposed to by the 8th grade is <i>mind boggling</i>. One source cited 15,000 unique words and over a million words read annually.<p>Aside from the words themselves, children have also by that age memorized an even larger number of phrases, pieces of sentence structure, and full sentences.<p>I think that because we aren't able to enumerate everything we've memorized, we don't fully appreciate just how much data is stored in our heads. As a result, I think it's possible that computer science researchers have largely been chasing a ghost in terms of some kind of magical ""understanding"" of language; the answer to NLP might actually be to simply store and access a terabytes-sized data structure of vocabulary and phrases.",1368132161

We perform experiments when possible so that we have more stuff to observe, or more controlled events.<p>Much of astronomy, atmospheric physics, geology, medicine, the ""soft"" sciences and I'm sure plenty of other ""hard"" fields are at the mercy of certain phenomena having sweet FA for data points. And I'm sure they all do what astrophysicists do: make sure that what we do have plenty of data for works; make our extrapolations with as few assumptions/rounding errors as we can; and revisit existing models anytime we find a new data point.<p>It's as scientific as anything it's simply going to take longer to sort out in some cases.",1368132150

When I was in college (2003-2006), I wrote and sold software to unlock Motorola phones (back when the RAZR was big). It was my first startup, and was a lot of fun to build. But about a year in I was sent a cease and desist by Motorola for violating the DMCA, even though there was no copyright infringement involved.<p>A very lovely lawyer by the name of Jennifer Granick at Stanford Cyberlaw helped me out pro bono, the case was dropped, and Jennifer went on to petition the Librarian of Congress to have an exemption for unlocking added. That exemption was granted in 2006, renewed in 2009, then dropped in 2012. I haven't been in the unlocking business for a long time, but I thought I should do something about it. I started the WH petition, which got 114k signatures and a positive response from the WH. But I realized that the real culprit is DMCA Section 1201, it really is just a really poorly written law, and it effects a whole load of people. So, with the help of some friends (shout outs to Azat, Joe, Austin and Dmitri) we threw up the FixtheDMCA site over the course of three days, and I've been maintaining it since. Meanwhile I've been trying to coordinate with folks like the EFF and Public Knowledge who are pushing things on the DC side.<p>For me it's kind of a fun break from startups, and I kind of feel like it's paying back the favor J. Granick did to me back when I was a college student.<p>I would really love to hear some decent, reasoned arguments why the DMCA shouldn't be fixed (and by fixed I mean limited to cases of copyright infringement only), as I think at a certain point the content lobbies will probably start making them and I'd love to have responses ready.",1368131749

It prevents starvation, which otherwise blocks progress.<p>The interesting thing about that money is that in preventing starvation, it changes slightly how I approach my project. Because I know I won't starve for the next year, I can be a bit more exploratory with my work, and better understand the problems I'm solving. I can try a few more things without external pressure to make tangible progress.

So if we think about what this means, yes, parents should be affectionate toward their children rather than reserved. Parents should also be open to children pursuing THEIR OWN interests rather than the profile of interests reputedly best for getting into a famous college. Indeed, parents should be open to the possibility that a career in private industry in an occupation in which job applicants show what they can do through work-sample tests and being a ""smart and gets things done"" worker can be better for a young person than piling on lots of higher education degrees.<p>That said, letting Junior play video games all day (as contrasted with WRITING a few video games) is not good for Junior either. Maybe Junior won't report being depressed in that case until reaching his twenties and finding out he is unemployable at a living wage that allows independence from Mom and Dad. Maybe Junior, while growing up and having limited life experience, might benefit from some actual adult leadership and guidance. It is possible to do too little as well as too much in parenting.<p>(Basis of knowledge: I am the father in a ""half-Asian"" family, although oddly I am probably the ""tiger-like"" parent as a native-born American, while my Taiwanese wife is more easy-going.

Given the political tone behind the (unenforced) Reed amendment and the (proposed) Ex-PATRIOT act, anyone reasonable would avoid bringing up the non-tax-avoiding reasons and emphasize the other reasons.<p>But your view is that we can't make any inferences.

You insist on some statistical analysis, but in my readings, no one has come up with a better explanation for the increase - what tests should people do? Correlated it with Bieber Fever?<p>We can't get meaning from those numbers, and it's hard to get that information directly from the people, but we can ask people who generally give international tax advice. Biased though it might be, that's what this CNN article does.<p>In fact, it gives a specific and reasonable example of why someone may renounce their US citizenship, because of tax purposes: ""growing numbers of Middle Eastern investors were ordering their dual-citizen children to dump their U.S. passports if they wanted to inherit family-owned companies without onerous U.S. estate taxes"".<p>This is not vague, though it is from a secondary source.<p>Therefore I persist in correcting you. This article gives enough information to draw the reasonable conclusion - affirmed by other data - that 1) renunciations are increasing and 2) that the US tax laws are a likely factor.",1368129830

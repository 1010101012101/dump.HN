Interfaces exist in the art world as well, for example architecture and sculpture can be &quot;used&quot; as well as looked at.<p>Business design introduces another wrinkle but I would argue it&#x27;s impact <i>should</i> be considerably less.

I did a lot of volunteer work. I had a health site for a time and people either pissed on me and told me it was a worthless piece of shit or they told me it was wonderful but I should give away what I know out of the goodness of my heart. So both people who felt I did not know anything of value and people who felt I did know something of value felt I should not get anything in return for the value offered.<p>I think that&#x27;s a broken model. I am well aware that we pay a premium to hit men or for people to ruin their quality of life by working long overtime hours, but if you do it right, creating value should come back to you. Yes, you have to not bleed the market. &quot;Strip-mining&quot; type business models can extract value until it runs out. There are situations -- mining certain minerals -- where, no, no more is being made. But there are also situations where taking too much at one time reduces the long term value (deforestation comes to mind). So being good stewards of the earth&#x27;s resources can actually improve long term profitability and that should be a big part of socially conscientious businesses.<p>The other thing is that a lot of things humans value are not directly measurable in the way you seem to be framing things. I had a job where I worked 37.5 hours/week. It was a full time job and it was an evening shift, so they gave a bit of a bonus to make it pay about the same as the day shift. I wanted the evening shift because of my health issues and the slightly less long work week made a big difference for me in my ability to cope.<p>People who have kids or health issues or are going to school while working or have some hobby that matters a lot to them -- their job needs to accommodate the fact that they have a life, they don&#x27;t just live to work. The work to live. So how a job is packaged can ultimately matter more than whether or not someone thinks a particular job is morally &quot;good.&quot;",1396986416

This exploits the patients natural spasticity, along with the physiology of the body (joints can only go so many ways) to get the patient able to stand with parallel bars or in some other controlled manner.<p>Nerve stimulation also supposedly reduces the &#x27;trigger  energy&#x27; of certain muscle sets, thus sidestepping the impedance problem. An overly simplistic example : imagine a knee muscle requires 1mW to trigger into an action, however the circuit leading to this nerve only allows for half of that due to damage adding resistance along the pathway. FES can artificially increase the energy available to that muscle set so that the trigger may be more properly interpreted, hopefully leading to a successful &#x27;firing&#x27; of the muscle.<p>source: i&#x27;m a quadriplegic, and FES makes me spasm into a &#x27;stiff as a board&#x27; plank.",1396986247

One which is equally applicable to Bitcoin and which was described by the Bitcoin as an ecosystem improvement for Bitcoin years ago. And not just as armwaving, I at least went as far as enumerating the things we&#x27;d need to do before I got mired in the problem of how do you make it not an extreme risk in the face of alt implementations— something which isn&#x27;t solved even absent almost-never-executed anti-fraud code paths. It&#x27;ll be super awesome to see you implement it, if you do.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to respect your good work when it results in a lot of people being misinformed about advantages because you&#x27;ve been sloppy about talking about the attribution. The end result of these is that you produce armys of technically unsophisticated people who believe that it&#x27;s the gospel truth that Bitcoin can&#x27;t do this.",1396985245

7555427,comment,7552622,7554641,2,0,vidarh,,,"> With JITs you get devirtualization as well, so no need for vtables.<p>That&#x27;s what I referred to with &quot;inline caches&quot;. The problem is that for Ruby you need fully polymorphic inline caches, with guards all over the place, because unless you do tons of analysis upfront, you will have problems knowing whether or not the world has totally changed on you after any method call, and almost anything is a method call. (call into code you have not verified can&#x27;t possibly call &quot;eval&quot;, and you might find that adding two integers afterwards does in fact not add them, but returns a string and changes global variables, and what-not)<p>The upshot, is that compared to vtables, you&#x27;re not actually saving all that much. E.g., take &quot;1 + 2 - 3&quot;. You could inline Fixnum#+ (and could reasonably do so with an AOT compiler too). But you need to add a type guard before the inlined fragment to verify that Fixnum#+ still is the Fixnum#+ you inlined, which at the minimum costs you a comparison and a branch <i>or</i> you need to record <i>every</i> call-site with inlined code and be prepared to overwrite it with fixups if the implementation changes.<p>And if Fixnum#+ has been overridden, or the Fixnum#+ implementation has method calls, chances are you will need another guard before &quot;-&quot; too, because you might not even know for sure whether or not the object returned from &quot;1 + 2&quot; will be a Fixnum, so you might find that the inlined method suddenly is for the wrong class.<p>I&#x27;m planning on benchmarking inline caching for my compiler against vtables, but absent evidence to the contrary I&#x27;m expecting that there will be a very substantial number of cases where the complexity isn&#x27;t worth it, or where they might even turn out to be slower.<p>> Something possible in AOT as well to certain extent, but it requires a mix of profile guided optimizations coupled with whole programm analysis.<p>It does if you want to do <i>everything</i> upfront, but you can pull things into inline caches with a mostly-AOT compiler relatively easily with just a little bit of extra information, and a few guards thrown in to do some basic tracing.",1396985229

If the CPU has some special instruction I want to use, I can use inline assembly.<p>Any language that prevents me from doing arbitrary pointer arithmetic and memory accesses prevents me from doing a lot of useful things I can do in C. See my other comment about linked lists with 16-bit pointers on a 64-bit CPU.<p>My understanding of Rust is that its pointers have similar semantics to the &quot;safe_pointers&quot; in C++. If that&#x27;s the case, my understanding is that it would prevent me from doing things like the 16-bit linked list (please, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).",1396984629

Also, I never claim that challenge-response protocols are not applicable to Bitcoin; theoretically, we know that any scalability improvement that is applicable to Ethereum would also applicable to Bitcoin simply because you can implement Bitcoin as an Ethereum contract. Rather, I made the claim that Bitcoin _does_ not have full support for such protocols. I count myself among those who are skeptical that substantial changes to the Bitcoin protocol will ever be made, primarily because of the &quot;changing an engine on the run&quot; problem and the nasty political issues involved (see: the recent Counterparty spat).

There is nothing to install; it will be available anywhere and work on any device, not just in the MegaCorp App Store for certain devices; it&#x27;s probably more secure since there are no permission prompts that might sneak certain capabilities past you; you can publish whatever content you want without having to get prior approval; you can update whenever you like without having to wait for acceptance. Obviously there are some practical concerns (performance, features, monetisation etc), but things are getting better. E.g. on the tech side, WebGL is now available on pretty much every mobile OS except iOS (for Android, use Chrome), &#x27;add to homescreen&#x27; gives you an app-like icon and fullscreen experience on both iOS and Android (again with Chrome), and fullscreen API support gives you an app-like experience even from the browser itself. I think  in the long run that the mobile web and native apps will have approximately the same capabilities for the majority of use cases, and the key differences will only be distribution and monetisation - both of which are solvable (startup idea anyone?)<p>For me, the main point is the web has always been an open platform you can do what you like with. The control is all with the developer. App stores take that control away, locking your app in a vendor-specific walled garden - assuming they let you in - which they can then evict you from at any time for any reason. Surely that&#x27;s not better than the web?",1396983896

It&#x27;s quite common to see a full page prompt to download the App in big letters, and tiny text to continue onto the mobile site.<p>Of course it&#x27;s a better experience to use the app. The first experience of the mobile website is an intrusive advertisement saying &quot;use the app&quot;.<p>Given an apples to apples comparison, I find that mobile apps often don&#x27;t have all of the features of the website. Youtube comments is a good example. You simply cannot edit comments on the mobile app.<p>Native Mobile apps also fragment development effort. This leads to a worse overall platform experience, since the development is fragmented to n platforms (don&#x27;t forget about Windows & Firefox phones). When new features need to be added, they need to be developed on all platforms. The more complex the feature-set & UX, the worse this issue becomes.<p>This fragmentation is mitigated by using a tool like PhoneGap. However, you still have added complexity via versioning. It&#x27;s overcome-able.<p>My current project has a rich mobile web experience. We also use phonegap, so all development is in sync. The featureset is complex & rapidly evolves. There are many edge cases. It would not be a practical business with n codebases.",1396983694

Kernel space is distinct address from non-kernel space etc (this got really challenging on non-64 bit machines at the end of their reign)<p>Is it a net win?

To give up would mean that they&#x27;re doing something else and AFAIK this is still best practice. The early Go team did believe this would be an okay idea, but over time everyone has noticed that it may not be for the best. However, the Go team also punted on solving the problem while thinking that the community will figure something out. The problem is that &quot;go get&quot; is already built into our standard toolchain. The moment you start using a dependency manager, now the official toolchain workflow is broken and you&#x27;ve fragmented the ecosystem. If people really want a solution to this problem they need to prod the Go team and finally get an official decision made and merged into the go tool, rather than just creating their own binary.",1403951855
7957919,comment,7956246,7956956,3,0,mbrock,,,"I think that&#x27;s pretty much a straw man. Where is all this terrible macro-laden Lisp code? Well, it&#x27;s probably not totally made up, but you run into overcomplicated abstractions in every language.<p>Somehow it seems more likely that people are put off by the slightly &quot;isolationist&quot; culture of Lisp, or the historical clash between Lisp and Unix, or whatever, and then this &quot;unreadable&quot; idea is like a rationalization for not liking the language? This is just a hunch...<p>You could make all kinds of arguments for the difficulty and obscurity of Haskell, yet it&#x27;s winning ground quite effectively. I think this basically started with the success of GHC and Cabal/Hackage in creating an infrastructure that&#x27;s familiar and efficient.<p>The Lisp world always had good infrastructure engineering. The main compilers (SBCL, CMUCL, etc) are very impressive! But it takes a very intensive kind of community engagement nowadays to stay up to date.<p>I still think Lisp could have a renaissance. Maybe it&#x27;s already going on with Clojure. And of course Emacs is quite strong.<p>The ideal of programming seems to be software architectures based on layers of coherent abstraction. That&#x27;s very, um, abstract, and there are different ways to do it. With OO, you imagine objects cooperating in layers. With Haskell-like functional programming, you use a mathematical style of abstraction, trying to find theories and algebras that make sense and compose, building applications out of combinations of well-typed values, etc.<p>Paul Graham describes the Lisp style in his texts on Lisp. You can see it in Emacs&#x27;s various DSLs (for defining customization parameters, for traversing buffers, etc). It encourages abstraction layers built so as to form mini-languages. So a library can easily provide custom syntactic forms. Instead of having a small number of syntactic forms (if, for, etc) and an expression language based on function application, Lisp is syntactically extensible.<p>Programming is not a solved problem! We still aren&#x27;t really sure about how to design programs, how to create coherent abstraction layers. The Haskell approach is very interesting, but not totally fleshed out. People are still working out the best way to structure concurrent I/O pipelines with error handling, for example. I sort of lost my train of thought, but Lisp is very interesting!",1403951782

A fractal set generally contains infinitely many points whose organization is so complicated that it is not possible to describe the set by specifying directly where each point in it lies. Instead, the set may be defined by &quot;the relations between the pieces.&quot; It is rather like describing the solar system by quoting the law of gravitation and stating the initial conditions. Everything follows from that. It appears always to be better to describe in terms of relationships.&#x27;",1403951442

For example, this code:<p><pre><code>    printf(&quot;the pointer&#x27;s value is %d&quot;, *p);\n    free(p);\n</code></pre>\nwould not cause a warning under my proposal, even if free() contains a NULL check. The source code contains no unreachable lines, only the inlined/macroexpanded code does. On the other hand, most &quot;gotcha&quot; examples proposed so far do have unreachable source lines, and would lead to warnings.<p>Can you give an example of useful code that contains unreachable lines before macroexpansion and inlining? What&#x27;s wrong with emitting a warning so the programmer can delete the useless line?<p>> <i>You&#x27;ll notice in a lot of cases that the exploitation of UB looks different for the same cases with different compilers or even compiler versions.</i><p>That&#x27;s OK.

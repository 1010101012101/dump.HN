529721,comment,527363,529583,0,0,moe,,,"<i>For another example: I'm working with a large online invitation website that is doing a big redesign of their site. The new UI is effectively one ""page"" and everything is done via AJAX calls to a JSON service layer, including login. Authentication to that service layer is done via a custom HTTP header that is a SHA encoding of the username + password + timestamp (among other things). If you wanted to test with 1000's of user accounts with traditional load testing, you end up needing to do the SHA encoding on the fly in whatever tool you're using (VBScript, LoadRunner's crazy C-like language, etc).</i><p>Well, now that's what I would call a corner case, and an absurd implementation. I'd suggest to optimize for the 99% ""normal"" Ajax and Flash websites and leave the testing of such obscurities to the people who invented them in first place.<p><i>I really just can't think of a UI that would allow you easily record a Google search for one term and then abstract the test out to work with N search terms.</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean here. I thought google search terms are normally passed in a single parameter?<p><i>Because the AJAX requests become data dependent (""foo"" causes 3 requests, ""foobar"" causes 6), you ultimately end up writing control structures</i><p>Well, hence the proposed ""Make-n-substr-clones-to-emulate-incremental-search"" functionality. And yes, branching and loops would be most welcome - make it a neat drag'n'drop affair with your javascript framework of choice.\nHonestly this stuff is not rocket science. It needs thought and there will be ugly corner cases. But if you can smack down only 80% of cases with a flexible UI then that's a big deal. For the rest we can still dive in and debug selenium scripts (which is a royal pita in my expirience, but admittedly I haven't touched it in over a year).<p>Anyways, I didn't mean to bash your service here. It certainly has its place, I'm just not the target audience.<p>If you want to appeal to people like me then you'll just have to add a bit more flexibility and comfort to the actual script creation part. As said, that's where the lions share of our time is going, and pretty screenshots do nothing for us.<p>Still keep up the good work. :-)",1237869621

Which reads aloud and can automatically adjust to your reading level, suggesting new books as you go.<p>I think we need to look at some new economic models for teaching. Maybe a school could simply garnish 5% of every dollar a student makes above, say, 75% of the median wage, for 10 years. That gives the school some guaranteed income and the incentive to teach students economically useful skills, quickly.<p>Also, new reasons to learn and new ways to learn.<p>The main problem with educational software today is that the administration buys it and it serves their purposes, not the students'. This is an exactly analogous situation with corporate IT software buying. Except it's even worse because the administration is a quasi-branch of the government.<p>Out with the state curriculum and the bureaucrats. In with selling education to the people being educated. Education <i>for its own sake</i>. If that means we develop a course in rap lyrics, we'll give you rap lyrics. But we'll also discuss the history of martial poetry too, from the Greeks onwards. We're also going to discuss rhetoric, the mathematics of periodicity, rhythm, and the Nyquist theorem of sampling. If you want to learn how to read the Bible better, we'll do that too, and that way we can bring in practically everything in English literature after the King James Version.<p>Graduating from a grade should be like getting a belt in martial arts. Something you do at your own pace and a test you take at your own initiative (with parental prompting too). The difference between slow students and fast students is usually something like 33-50%. So if someone needs two years to master algebra, let them TAKE two years. It's not a race for fuck's sake.<p>Education should be interwoven with doing actually useful things. I think pg is right on the money that kids are mainly disconnected from society because we go to great lengths to disconnect them. Drug dealers know that at least some 14-year-olds can be trusted with limited responsibilities; so would it really be so terrible to have kids doing some jobs in a more positive working environment?<p>Let's put education in unusual places, with the people who need it and are motivated to learn.

I think many people buy homes because it is that thing they have to keep up with their neighbors/peers.<p>On the other hand, owning your own property empowers you in ways that should not be discounted. To give simple example, consider the problem of ""gentrification."" This happens when there is a poor neighborhood that over time attracts a young, usually creative crowd. This leads to pressure for housing there, that in turn leads to speculators and developers who improve/replace buildings further driving the process until the character of the neighborhood is totally changed.<p>This is a pattern that people observe over and over again. This process is at its worst when the original neighborhood has few or no owner occupants. In these situations there is little to stop a developer from being able to go through and completely change the character of the neighborhood en masse and overnight. Worst of all, the original residents don't benefit form this process-- their rent rises and when they stop being able to afford living there, they have no choice but to leave.<p>On the other hand, when there is a mix of ownership and rentership in the neighborhood the gentrification process proceeds much more slowly and in a way that benefits the original residents who, if they choose to leave, enjoy a profit in the sale, not steadily increasing rents.",1237867900

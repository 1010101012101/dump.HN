Say that in order for each employee to have their own office you need 10m2 extra space per employee. Where I live, that would amount to ~2.5% of the employees salary, i.e. if a private office makes your emplyees more than 2.5% more productive you&#x27;re profiting from private offices. In my experience my productivity boost when working in a private office amounts to maybe as much as 25% or more.",1385071151

When network goes down music goes down which is expected ( kind of , why doesnt the app buffer music?) but when network comes back music never comes back. \nb) Non existent buffering: Please take a leaf from pandora&#x27;s book and look at how fast their music streams under spotty(any) connection. I kept thinking &#x27;hey they are new, they&#x27;ll figure it out soon&#x27;, but nothing after 2 years. \nc) App keeps crashing: i&#x27;ve had several incidents where app crashes and never recovers so i have to completely uninstall and reinstall the app ( and re download al the offline music). unacceptable. The app i have now on my phone crashes every time when it comes up( which was kind of the final straw). I can send you crash logs if you want.<p>2. Desktop App: Super flakey. It is gone for hours every-couple of days. All I see is a blank screen ( right click reload does nothing) . There was more than one occasion where I had to completly uninstall and reinstall the app.\nI could go on forever, but it boils down to this - stop doing constant/minor/useless UI improvements, UI is not as important as you guys think it is, if the apps are barely functional.",1385069079

6777598,comment,6776807,6776807,1,0,AaronFriel,,,"I&#x27;m curious about their decision to eschew &quot;complicated secret primitives&quot;:<p>> Red October is based on combinatorial techniques and trusted cryptographic primitives. We investigated using complicated secret primitives like Shamir&#x27;s sharing scheme, but we found that a simpler combinatorial approach based on primitives from Go&#x27;s standard library was preferable to implementing a mathematical algorithm from scratch. Red October uses 128-bit AES, 2048-bit RSA and scrypt as its cryptographic primitives.<p>While it&#x27;s usually preferable to rely on well-tested cryptographic code, I wonder if this scheme is weaker because of the matroyshka doll approach taken with encryption. My personal concerns are mitigated by the fact that the secret-managing server could be made physically secure, but I&#x27;m concerned that their approach allows incremental progress to be made in decrypting secrets.<p>For example, if users A_1,A_2...A_N all provide passwords, of which any 3 can decrypt a package, then there will be N * N-1 * N-2 / 6 copies of the secret on the server. (In general: N choose K, where N is the number of parties to the secret and K is the number required to decrypt.) For the previous example, 20 users and 3 needed to decrypt, 1140 ciphertexts will be generated. The worst case scenario is when K approaches N/2, 20 users with any 10 able to decrypt would produce close to 184,756 ciphertexts.<p>My problems, from a naive non-cryptographer&#x27;s view, are:<p>1. That&#x27;s a lot of data, and cryptographers tend to loathe giving attacks more data.<p>2. I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s any approaches to cracking these secrets that can take advantage of the fact that the same plaintext secret is going to be available as a very large number of ciphertexts. It seems that a meet-in-the-middle attack might substantially reduce the security guarantees here.<p>Could any cryptographers chime in? Is Red October a good model for securing secrets?",1385069003

And it also is somewhat antithetical to our design process, which is kinda centralized around Stephen himself, who for the most part really does have a good sense of design.<p>I think that could change, though, and then I think there is a really good opportunity to open source more of our stuff and start building stuff collaboratively with a wider community. Especially when our Cloud stuff comes online.<p>Also, I regularly bug Wolfram about open-sourcing some core part of the kernel. He&#x27;s not in principal against it, but points out that it would cost a lot, buy us nothing in the short term, and fork the language.

Gave up posting it here because paywall + language where too much hurdle for HN, and couldn&#x27;t find a better article.<p>Seing this article afterward and the quality of the response (up to the article&#x27;s value I guess), well, my reaction was not up to my own standards.<p>.<p>Still, the french institution judgment was quite stupid, and we had a good laugh. The blogger&#x27;s reaction to is incoming legal battle was beyond stupid. When you receive official document an incoming legal battle, you don&#x27;t ignore it outright, you either deal with it or hire someone to do it, you check what you can do and what you risk. Ignoring it until you are fined is not the best way to be heard when complaining afterward.<p>I&#x27;ll let the previous comment I made in the thread untouched.

How does it measure up vs. Mathematica and Maple?<p>Sage can produce some very interesting results, but it has a rather steep learning curve and requires more study and time than the commercial alternatives.<p>Sage has a full house of powerful mathematical tools, suitable for professionals as well as students, but you have to read more documentation than its alternatives require, and there are no sophisticated tab-completion features and wizards to accomplish various tasks.<p>One of Sage&#x27;s advantages is that it can use a browser as an interface, offering a pretty nice working environment that relies on the browser&#x27;s abilities. Example: <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/VvrGng2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/VvrGng2.png</a><p>Over time Sage has gotten much better, mostly because of all the skilled volunteers finding and fixing bugs and writing new abilities into the feature set.

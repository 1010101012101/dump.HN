Parameters which are below the threshold of detection can drastically affect their trajectory in phase space. Accidental complexity has zoomed off to live a life all its own, and that takeoff has been continuous for decades [2].<p>Everything we build around software that's not directly bearing on the problem domain is chipping away at this or that aspect of the ungoverned bits.

There is no final boss which, once defeated, leads to the scrolling names and 8-bit themesong.

Turn on showdead for an even more depressing trip through my replies. Then ask yourself if this can <i>ever</i> come to an understanding without me seeing the ""error of my ways"" and adopting the ""acceptable"" position of this community. Then, go even further, and ask yourself if it matters one iota of a shit more than the several minutes I've already spent subjecting myself to this beating, including someone telling me I should play with anthrax and <i>die</i> for fuck's sake. Then turning it around on me and calling it <i>my fault</i> after I called him out on it (and got downvoted yet fucking again for doing so!).<p>The answer is, very clearly, absolutely not on all accounts. Hacker News does not tolerate dissenting opinion and that should scare you. The continued existence of this community and any contribution is plainly pointless, and while I'd invest a little time demonstrating that to you, I know that nobody will listen, I'll turn light gray, and this community will go back to having a grand old time patting themselves on the back throwing money at a Florida teenager they have never, and will never, meet nor hear about ever again.<p>One of the (many) problems in our discourse today is that there is no middle. No compromise. Ever. Look at American politics for an example. Even in this discussion here, there was no possible suggestion that I might be a little right, no possible seeking of an understanding, no middle ground. You either think this girl deserves our showering of praise and affection or you suffer the consequences and get grayed to nonexistence.<p>No, nitrogen. I'm done. You guys can have your polarized, pointless discussion, and I will go back to keeping my opinions to myself.

I hoped that maybe, just maybe, I could effect some change and get people to see that there is a middle, there is a compromise, there is an opportunity for discussion. When I follow the community, I am rewarded with heaps of karma -- including one comment with dozens of upvotes for saying what HN wants to hear. When I dare speak against the community, as I have here, I am reminded why I keep my distance and why those of us who think rationally consider this community a heaping pile of arrogant shit. You should hear what people outside HN say about it, based on discussions like this. Congratulations, HN. You're now Slashdot. You're now the community that in a single thread compared a teenager that built a bomb in a two-liter bottle to Alfred Nobel and Marie Curie.<p>In the hours since you left this question for me, I went to see a film and forgot about Hacker News for four hours, and it was four glorious, wonderful hours I intend to repeat.

So there are still quite a lot of open questions about exhaustion doctrine as it applies to patents, especially when international trade is introduced, and also when the original supplier preemptively imposes restrictions (such as the ""not for resale"" that would certainly be on the packaging of any chemicals sold today).  One mitigating thing that might help in this situation though is that price-fixing is often viewed as a situation where such resale restrictions can be found to be invalid.<p>So, basically this is all really muddy and not entirely decided (exhaustion doctrine is just common law to begin with) and there's no yes/no answer as to whether my half-sarcastic statement is valid, but we do live in a world that is very different than the early 1900s in a lot of ways, many of them for the better, but some of them for the worse.",1368684872

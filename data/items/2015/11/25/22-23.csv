But you also know what you\nneed to learn, practice and do in order to raise your scores.  It\nmakes the entire system transparent, comprehensible and above all\nmeans that your pay is essentially something that&#x27;s entirely under\nyour control.  I found this very liberating.<p>&quot;so someone&#x27;s always going to feel treated unfairly.&quot;<p>At some point that will happen, yes.  This comes back to the value of\ntransparency: we strive to create an environment where, if someone\nfeels hard done by, he or she can have that conversation openly and\nsafely with the people involved.  And it&#x27;d be a lot more objective and\nconstructive than if salaries and their computations were closed.<p>&quot;I think Joe is being paid more than me, but I don&#x27;t know for sure,\nand I don&#x27;t know the reasons ...&quot; is a fast-track route to\n(justified!) resentment.<p>&quot;Also, unless you bend the scoring rules ... you have probably reduced\ncapacity of negotiation to attract talent ... and also probably\nreduces your capacity for retention&quot;<p>So far that&#x27;s not been my experience.  What I&#x27;ve seen is that the open\nsalary model is a really attractive proposition for candidates,\nbecause they know they&#x27;ll be paid fairly.  The salaries are adjusted\nannually based on market changes, CPI, etc.<p>In terms of being able to compete against companies with higher\nsalaries, there are two approaches.  One: raise the levels for\neveryone.  Two: compete on culture and other perks (of which we offer\na <i>lot</i>).<p>One thing we definitely don&#x27;t do is make exceptions to the model.  I\nwouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone else taking the same approach,\neither: in addition to being the wrong thing to do, my gut feeling is\nthat backing down on an approach like this would be catastrophic for\nstaff morale.<p><i>Edited</i>: Oh, and we try not to use or think in terms of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not a scale of moral judgement, but a measure of outcomes.  Also, we try to keep it as concrete and observation-based as possible.  E.g. we don&#x27;t say &quot;we think this person is a level 4 Fooblerizer&quot;, we say &quot;this person has Fooblerized for several clients successfully, and is now leading a team of Fooblerizers on-site&quot;.",1448492340

If someone makes an insensitive joke, it&#x27;s true that the social justice movement often reacts disproportionately, but I&#x27;m not that worried about people&#x27;s right to make insensitive jokes. I&#x27;m much more worried about the people who are sharing opinions that are perfectly reasonable and necessary to the public discourse and are being squashed. Erika Christakis presented a reasoned argument at Yale for free speech, and people were calling for her and her husband to resign.

We aren&#x27;t doing okay at security, and capabilities are still a promising solution.<p>The solutions where capabilities are truly most promising have no embedded competitors. I&#x27;m looking at things like SELinux here. Few other solutions (except e.g. Macaroons) are actually capable of making correct authorization decisions in scenarios involving 3+ principals: the competition is broken, and vicariously, so are most authorization systems which try to solve 3+ principal authorization problem correctly.<p>You may as well be arguing that memory safe / garbage collected languages lost to C circa 1995. C is broken and programs written in C will always be full of holes as compared to equivalent programs in memory safe languages just in the same way as authorization systems not built to handle 3+ principals will make wrong decisions. This is why it&#x27;s 2015 and we&#x27;re still dealing with CSRF.<p>If you implement SELinux at your job like I do, and have some informed criticism about how Capsicum is unneeded because SELinux is great, I&#x27;d love to hear it!

Sure, they could still compromise Chrome, but there would be no “Google Approved” method of doing so. Dell would either: Have to give up, or: Literally install malware on their computers.

It could be assumed that your computer was trustworthy unless it had already been compromised by the adversary. Security in that model was largely based around the &quot;computers should do what their users want&quot; idea. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t line up with the actual state of computers and computer users today.<p>Modern security systems (especially those in mobile devices and web browsers) are designed to be three-party: you, your agent, and the adversary. You can be trusted, the adversary can&#x27;t be trusted, and your agent (software on your computer) can be trusted sometimes. It&#x27;s not automatically true that code running on your computer, on your behalf, is actually safe. Most users have no idea what that code is even doing.<p>This three-party model is what underpins the app sandbox, it&#x27;s what underpins web app security including the same-origin policy, and it&#x27;s what underpins things like Mozilla and Chrome&#x27;s plugin and extension blocking. You can&#x27;t always assume that computers are doing what their users want.<p>I think what is difficult about this is that, as your technical expertise rises, the two-party model becomes closer to the truth and the three-party model less so.

That&#x27;s one of the fundamental mechanisms of racism, among other unpleasant things. Hardly anyone <i>thinks</i> of themselves as racist, so when they make a racist argument (not saying this one is, just making a broader point), they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s racist - they think it&#x27;s all about the equality.<p>The classic example of that is the &quot;All lives matter&quot; response to &quot;black lives matter&quot;. Saying black lives matter is a response to the daily bigotry and institutional racism that black people in America suffer, every day. Responding to that with &quot;all lives matter&quot; is a way of disempowering even the acknowledgement of institutional racism, of denying the unique (and uniquely negative) experience of being black. But it <i>sounds</i> like equality. People who say it don&#x27;t say it to be racist - quite the opposite. Being racist by acting not-racist. It&#x27;s ironic and strange-loopy, but that&#x27;s how it works.<p>Take it back to the post you&#x27;re responding to. It&#x27;s a reflexive defense of authority, the &quot;few bad apples&quot; argument. The first response to obvious institutional racism (really, this case boils down to &quot;all blacks look alike&quot;) is to shout &quot;Hey, the System isn&#x27;t broken!&quot; It&#x27;s <i>not</i> broken if you&#x27;re white, and you don&#x27;t recognize how it treats people who aren&#x27;t like you. It disacknowledges the experience of the individual at the hands of the System, by making sure defending the System comes first.<p>Thinking about this stuff is hard.

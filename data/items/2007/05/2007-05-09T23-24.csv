20897,comment,20795,20842,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... What if the command line interpreter gets smarter and understands concepts within your query. ...'</i><p>Been taking precisely that approach for some time thinking through and trying to create a CLI with recognition. The novel approach consisted (I've since stopped working on this particular problem) of an interface that interacted with some known commands, applications and data.<p>The more you type into the machine, the more it recognises certain things related information names, associated projects, that appointment you have for next week, the document due next week.   The crux was realising that meaning could be attained from small SMS like messages. A message could consist of peoples names, times, predefined commands. Then trying to weave some sort of context within related messages.<p>The big problem is the <i>contextual awareness</i>. NLP is one way to go, but recognition without having to annoy the user with confirmation is difficult.  Recognising language is a big ball of string.   One promising approach is to add a Adventure like shell interface onto the front, pre-describe (or dynamically build) the <i>space</i> you can navigate. This means your using a human brain to augment the system offsetting having to use the brute force approach. Then integrate with back-end applications.<p>Sounds good in theory but I agree it is HARD.

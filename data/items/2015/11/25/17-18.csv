Basically, the terms ADD and ADHD are falling out of use because effectively the entire population fits the diagnostic criteria. It’s not a condition anymore, it’s a trait — the inherent and unavoidable experience of modern life characterized by “distractibility, inner frenzy, and impatience.”</i><p>This stood out to me, and warrants a discussion of its own. What was widely considered maladaptive to the point of being a mental disorder is now common to the entire population? Do we accept this as a new reality or are there steps we can take to restore flow, reduce interruptions, and enhance concentration at a macro level?",1448474398

There have been several bugs in programs using SVG concerning the parsing path strings that were related to white space.<p>Basic shapes that can just as easily can be constructed using <path>, especially the polygon and polyline.<p>The total absurdity that is <text>. Text usually isn&#x27;t the main content of images, yet the chapter about text is the longest in the SVG specification, containing stuff like text flowing along a path. And all this without supporting multi-line text. Just use <path> instead, bitmap graphics also uses rasterized text.

10628463,comment,10626210,10628241,0,0,kbenson,,,"I feel for both sides of this argument.  Trvializing something traumatizing that people feel strongly about is not good, but I&#x27;m not sure using it in this context is exactly trivializing. The commenter could have said &quot;banks still kill us with fees us six ways from Sunday&quot; and most people would not say they were trivializing murder.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure when sexual assault became worse than murder, but at some point in the past it did.  You can&#x27;t use rape/sexual assault as hyperbole in many places where you could easily use kill/murder etc.  Maybe that&#x27;s because there are survivors to read/hear the communication and be affected by it (although there are plenty of people affected by loss of a loved one through murder).  In any case, I think this disproportionate response with regard to talking about sexual assault when compared to talking about items of a similar or worse level, such as murder, leads to people being confused by what appears to be inconsistent responses on crimes of this caliber.<p>So, with all that said, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that hard to understand why some people don&#x27;t understand the problem of using &quot;rape&quot; as slang to mean &quot;taken advantage of&quot; or &quot;coerced&quot; when &quot;murder&quot;, &quot;kill&quot;, and &quot;dead&quot; are often used with no problem to mean &quot;mad at&quot;, &quot;should expect a rough time&quot; or &quot;be careful&quot;.  Unless you are willing to either additionally condemn all uses of that type of speech, or define why it&#x27;s very different, reducing the use of &quot;rape&quot; as used here to &quot;trivializing sexual assault&quot; is both inconsistent and unfair.",1448474319

Planes are kept relatively simple, despite their actual complexity, for a reason.<p>So it&#x27;s unlikely that whole-plane parachutes would actually save lives with jetliners. Light aircraft incidents are much more common, and they&#x27;re small enough to benefit significantly from a parachute.",1448473860

It&#x27;s like a big optimisation problem slowly working its way toward the maximum. It&#x27;s like a personal singularity.<p>Sometimes I spend so much time in my head that I forget to change my environment. It would be nice if our best thoughts could somehow be put into effect more quickly without necessarily interrupting other planned activities. I guess that&#x27;s where self-control and sequential execution come in. At the same time, the original plans may have become invalid.<p>Sometimes after you change your environment, it&#x27;s like you have to re-compile the kernel before you can run the program you were initially planning to run. The trick is in not losing state information during that recompiling process. Sometimes writing cookies (aka, notes) can help here. Conversely, some changes are so big (or time-consuming) that your whole plan needs to be re-wired.<p>They say that teaching is one of the best ways to learn. My experience seems to confirm this advice. Perhaps when you go and explain something to someone else, not only do you organise and solidify the understanding in your own mind, but since you pull something out of your brain and stick it to the extended you (and beyond), that knowledge can take on a life of its own in the outer world. Your very awareness that the knowledge has been transmitted to the outer world seems to have a strengthening effect in your &quot;inner you&quot;. It&#x27;s as if the outer &quot;awareness&quot; links back to hidden parts of the inner you, as were it virtual dendrites connecting your brain to the collective consciousness.",1448473630

They also have no sense of humor and college administrators as a group have no sense of humor or perspective, and they&#x27;re chronically worried about accusations of indifference or insensitivity (which are themselves as good as convictions). There is a strong economic and career incentive for administrators to take <i>everything</i> seriously and to keep their heads down as much as possible.<p>Brew this up and one gets a majority of students who are reasonable but a small minority who drive all the discourse.<p>I don&#x27;t teach at Yale and have never taught at Yale or schools with similar cultures, so I can&#x27;t speak to the environment there, but William Deresiewicz did, and his book <i>Excellent Sheep: The Miseducation of the American Elite and the Way to a Meaningful Life</i> came out of that and I recommend it.

There&#x27;s a direct flight from A->B that costs $400, or you can take an indirect flight through distant hub C that costs $200. Is it unethical or wasteful to choose A->C->B for $200? I think all of us would do this without a second thought, aside from willingly paying more in exchange for less hassle.<p>Compare to hidden city ticketing. Instead of buying A->C->B, you buy A->B->C for $200 and then stop at B. It&#x27;s no more wasteful than buying A->C->B, it&#x27;s just more comfortable for you. In fact, it&#x27;s slightly <i>less</i> wasteful, because there&#x27;s a possibility that the airline could give your empty B->C seat to a standby passenger.<p>Assuming you don&#x27;t have an ethical problem with the A->C->B hub flight, why would you have a problem with the A->B(->C) hidden city ticketing flight because of waste or disutility (or indeed anything else)?<p>I have no problem with price discrimination. But there are good and bad ways to do price discrimination. For example, one common method for flight discrimination is to charge less for tickets purchased farther in advance. Casual travelers typically book their travel well in advance, whereas business and other travelers willing to pay more typically book their travel shortly before they fly. This is just smart business, and it ensures that people who really need it can fly when they need to, but people who are more price sensitive can still travel. And you can&#x27;t really game this system.<p>Then you have airlines trying stupid tricks like charging negative prices for certain legs. This is just wasteful and stupid. Why should I feel in any way obligated to support this sort of price discrimination? They are welcome to try such nonsense, of course, but their customers are likewise welcome to take advantage of it. It is not <i>our</i> responsibility to make <i>their</i> pricing scheme work. They&#x27;re the ones who need to figure out workable pricing schemes.",1448473002

10628347,comment,10627873,10628139,0,0,seanherron,,,"In what modern situation would a whole plane parachute actually help save lives? The vast majority of the (extremely rare) commercial aircraft disasters occur during takeoff or landing, when a parachute would provide little utility due to the distance the aircraft is from the ground. Other notable recent disasters had either instantaneous destruction of the aircraft (Metrojet 9268, Malaysian 17) or were caused by pilot error or murder/suicide (Germanwings 9525, Colgan 2407).<p>Perhaps the only incident I can think of where a parachute may have helped was US Airways 1549, where a bird strike caused loss of power to both engines. In that case, however, sufficient safety controls existed to enable landing on the Hudson river, and the aircraft functioned as designed (engines broke off when hitting water, the aircraft floated long enough to ensure safe evacuation of all passengers, life rafts deployed, etc). I would argue a parachute would probably have resulted in loss of life as a giant A320 parachute falling uncontrolled on to New York City would probably kill people crashing in to a building.<p>Rather than focus on superfluous, impractical safety measures, commercial aircraft designers have instead spent time on things that actually save lives, such as Traffic Avoidance and Ground Proximity warning systems.<p>Note that parachutes do exist for smaller planes, where the risks and benefits are substantially different. A good example is the Cirrus SR-22. It seems that most cases of deploying the parachute on the Cirrus is due to pilots running out of fuel, a failure which is extremely improbable in commercial aviation.",1448472944

If you accept the story as an underdog success tale you might be frustrated.  If on the other hand you read it as a cautionary tale about what happens when all you have is buzz and marketing runs your company, I think you might enjoy it more.<p>The book purports to tell the story of how the Sega Genesis came out of nowhere to win massive market share in the gaming industry, but as you said the actual story consists of a long string of marketing junkets related anecdotally by the marketers in attendance.<p>Discussion of software engineering and hardware design is scant.  Meanwhile there&#x27;s an entire chapter dedicated to play-by-play of a weekend retreat Sega hosted for video game distributors.<p>There&#x27;s a few takeaways from this:<p>1. Distribution (marketing, sales, partnerships) is sometimes the whole story.<p>The Genesis story basically boiled down to &quot;they made a fun game with a cute mascot and then hired the right ad agency to flog it nationwide at massive cost&quot;.  As &quot;makers&quot; hanging out on HN that&#x27;s an offensive reading of history but the author talked to the principals and that&#x27;s the story they told.<p>2. If all you have is distribution, any gains you find will be unsustainable.<p>I found the last chapters of the book a downer.  The Sega America folks were tasked with marketing a confusing lineup of products, couldn&#x27;t get consumers excited about them, so they all jumped ship one by one.  At the end of the day they were just a bunch of marketers and that could only take them so far.<p>While the book&#x27;s decision to tell the story of the Genesis through its marketing seems to belittle the work of the actual product people back in Japan, it&#x27;s gentle telling of Sega America&#x27;s collapse post-Genesis shows the limitations of a marketing-only approach.<p>3. While the book appears to lionize the &quot;underdog&quot; Sega America team, in the end it&#x27;s the Nintendo folks who come across most impressively. The chapters where the authors cuts back to what Nintendo was up to at the time show a company with actual substance, identity, and a point of view.  While the &quot;heroes&quot; of the book run around from marketing strategy to marketing strategy, the &quot;villains&quot; quietly and confidently go about the business of making great products, manipulating distribution in a heavy handed yet open way, and marketing their products in simple, relatable marketing.<p>In the end, though the book appears to promote a &quot;marketing is all that matters&quot; approach to business it really argues that lasting success come from companies that are product driven.",1448471217

10628129,comment,10627472,10627472,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"I resent these kind of counter-intuitive &quot;I made a lot of money, didn&#x27;t actually think it would make me happy because I&#x27;m just that insightful, and lo and behold I was right all along&quot; stories. It reminds me of an Andrew Gelman quote I love: &quot;Just because something is counter-intuitive doesn&#x27;t make it true.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think very many people are so shallow as to believe that money will make them happy beyond a certain threshold of satisfying basic needs and security. Sometimes people can be depressed or sidetracked by other issues and can go through periods of life, maybe even long periods, where they believe certain materialistic or wealth-enabled options will make them happy. But then again, lots of people also fool themselves into believing that religion will do that, or getting married, or having a baby. It works out for some people; it doesn&#x27;t work out for others; and in general we all can&#x27;t read too much into how it worked for other people.<p>But where I get super frustrated is with a number of things that become ever more important yet ever less accessible to non-wealthy people. Particularly: legal protection and medical security.<p>Basic insurance in the U.S. is pretty shitty. My mother, for example, is a courtroom clerk and judge&#x27;s assistant in a small town in the Midwest. She&#x27;s a government employee (of the county where she lives) and she hasn&#x27;t been given a raise in over 5 years because it&#x27;s either the insurance gets cut more than it already has been or else pay freezes. She has over 25 years of experience as a paralegal and judge&#x27;s assistant and is a wizard with motions and lots of other legal documents, in addition to being exceptionally personable and polite to the many human beings who have to come through her office dealing with difficult court-related circumstances. Yet per year she earns less than $15,000 above the national poverty line in America, and even in her lower-cost-of-living area it&#x27;s extremely hard on her to make ends meet, and especially to deal with many of the health downturns that accompany ageing.<p>She only has 3 weeks of vacation (and she is even so gracious as to consider herself lucky(!) to have this). She&#x27;s in her mid fifties and has worked a full career and gets 15 days of paid time off, which must also be used for her sick time if needed. She can&#x27;t even take time off to help others in our family with childcare or holiday travel or anything because she has so few days of her own.<p>Would a million dollars magically make her happy? You damn well better believe it would. Would it totally solve all of her problems and make the essence of life more valuable or meaningful to her ... no, of course not, and that&#x27;s pretty irrelevant.<p>I also have experience with very frustrating legal issues as well. I don&#x27;t want to go on about an anecdotal situation, but my sister is tied up in a very expensive custody battle with the biological father of her son. The father in this situation has been arrested and convicted of many minor offenses, ranging from drug possession charges to fraudulent checks, but the custody issue came about because he was charged with a very significant set of crimes that place my nephew in pretty serious danger.<p>Yet the particular state that I live in has some of the most antiquated laws about child protection in these cases. Virtually 100% of the time, the state sides with the reasoning that it&#x27;s <i>always</i> in the best interest of a child to be with both parents, no matter what sort of crimes either parent has committed, even to the crazy extreme that our attorney has shown us case law in which a young girl was actually raped by her father and then later forced to have supervised visitation with him. In some cases, even against this state&#x27;s own Department of Corrections guidelines, they will conduct supervised visits at a jail or prison.<p>The custody issue has dragged on and on, and I have personally contributed a very large amount of money to fund our legal effort to seek supervised parenting time and potentially termination of parental rights.<p>If we weren&#x27;t pumping a ridiculous amount of money into the legal case, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that this would just be another run-of-the-mill case where the court looks contemptibly upon both parties, and pre-judges them both to be &quot;lowlifes&quot; merely for even having to be in court at all, and just goes by the status quo parenting time guidelines without even spending 10 seconds to think about the actual potential for harm to the child. Trust me, if I could give you all of the details, it would make you scream in disbelief and frustration.<p>And here again, it&#x27;s purely an issue of money. Do you have a spare $100,000 lying around to throw at a court case? Well, then your child gets to be protected and supervised. But if you don&#x27;t cough up the dough, your kid&#x27;s safety don&#x27;t mean shit.<p>So do I think I&#x27;d be happier with a million dollars? You bet your ass. Not because I want to own materialistic things or do bored billionaire shit like create my own cryonics rocket so that aliens can unthaw me in a thousand years, or surround myself with attractive people who will have sex with me because of my Lorentzian money distortion field even though from a genetic selection point of view I have zero business being with such people.<p>I just want to have a damn family holiday where me and my family are not maxing out our blood pressure because we&#x27;re worried about how my ageing mother will pay the medical bills for her quite normal and expected age-related conditions, or how my sister will come up with enough money to pay an attorney $1500 to create a motion objecting to an inappropriate child supervision arrangement proposed by the other party. Do you think a millionaire would have to put up with this shit?<p>Yeah, my basic needs are met. I&#x27;m sitting in a warm room using the internet right now and I have enough food. But fuck me if money wouldn&#x27;t <i>seriously</i> make me happy.<p>The hilarious thing: I&#x27;m very happy to work for it too. I don&#x27;t expect my parakeets-as-a-service business to disrupt everything and win me precious, precious VC dollars. All I want is for my labor to be fairly compensated and for employers to do simple things, like give people fair insurance and vacation time.",1448471039

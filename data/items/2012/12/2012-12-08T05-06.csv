4890847,comment,4890790,4890790,2,0,kiba,,,"It's probably a small part of why Asians are better at math. The more salient reason is that Asian have a reputation of working harder than anyone. That's why you see Asian succeeding in the west in acquiring high status jobs and high level education more than anyone. They valued formal education more highly than anybody.<p>However, just because Japan and China and South Korea work harder doesn't mean they win outright all the time. For example, Samsung is the winner in many area, but they are also one of the foot soldiers for google, and they are not really good at the kind of innovation that make Apple famous.<p>The US may have poorly educated students in math, and our programmers may be relatively less formally educated. We still kick ass, for some reason or another",1354946395

For example ""Professional Node.js"" has been published some weeks ago: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Node-js-Building-Javascript-Scalable/dp/1118185463/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Node-js-Building-Javascri...</a><p>Full disclosure: I did the technical editing for this book, thus I'm highly biased. However, it was a pleasure to receive the single chapters from Pedro Teixeira, the author. It really teached me a lot while working on them. I honestly think it is a wonderful book, and one that Node.js deserves now that it matures.",1354946390
4890845,comment,4890790,4890790,2,0,ryankey,,,"I've always attributed the excellence in mathematics to the culture and their emphasis on schooling. I have many Asian friends who grew up not knowing the language but with strict parents from these backgrounds. All of them perform above par in math, as well as school in general. Perhaps it is the language, but I have yet to see personal evidence of it.<p>I have to wonder, does the English language offer any improvements? Obviously it's the language of choice for most technical and scientific ventures. Is this simply because it became popular and stayed popular?",1354946377

It is not in breeders' interests to flood the market and collapse prices.<p>The problem is irresponsible pet owners who fail to neuter and spay their pets.<p>Santa Cruz County, California, where I used to live, enacted in 1995 a law requiring neutering and spaying of pets.

Though I imagine this is probably the popular opinion.<p>However, I attempted to figure out what the symbolism in the logo was supposed to be. Disregarding the ""fresh, hip, and modern"" style that they were going for, I can definitely see how this could have been pitched. From my analysis, the U is supposed to subtly be shaped as a book and the C is supposed to be a loading sign... It's symbolically loading knowledge.<p>Regardless of the symbolism, my opinion is that it is painfully ugly and not representative of the UC system. If the regents were democratic, I would definitely vote to throw it out.<p>Edit: I didn't actually see the associated video before posting. [1] At least the book symbolism shined through without knowing that first.

In fact, not having swap space doesn't mean you won't swap pages. It merely means that Linux has fewer choices about what RAM can be reused when a demand hits. Thus, it is possible for the throughput of a system that has no swap space to be lower than that of a system that has some.<p>2. Swap space is used for modified anonymous pages only. Your programs, shared libraries and filesystem cache are never written there under any circumstances.<p>3. Given items 1 and 2 above, the philosophy of minimization of swap space is really just a concern about wasted disk space.

Once I track this down again, can I post it on the wiki page or should I do something else first? I'm pretty sure that the titles were made up collectively there and that the term did <i>not</i> originate in a Monty Python skit.

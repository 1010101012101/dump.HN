I've been told that the gender imbalance in CompSci programs is less severe in India than it is in the U.S., for instance, relative to the overall gender imbalance in their workforce.<p>But in general it wouldn't surprise me if there is higher worldwide correlation among companies in software development than in other industries, because software development is so new, and because so many of the dominant companies are concentrated in the U.S.  Other industries, e.g. healthcare, operate in very different environments from country to country, so you would expect them to be less highly correlated.",1335466483
3895553,comment,3894302,3894990,4,0,rscale,,,"Your described scenario with Accenture doesn't describe a market-making HFT strategy.  You're describing something akin to a mean-reversion algorithm that would be MFT or slower, and is not a market-making strategy.  It demands that you buy and hold inventory to profit.  It doesn't provide liquidity.<p>Of course you can make a huge profit when a crash occurs, whether that crash is due to a vicious circle of algorithms, or a vicious circle of human psychology. There are algorithms out there that look to do just that, trying to profit from exploitable market anomalies, and it's great that those people have found a way to get paid for fixing some problems.  But they're not HFT market-makers, they're a different group of quant/algo traders.<p>Personally I care little about HFT.  The flaws in the technology will get ironed out; the competition for the low-hanging fruit will continue to intensify, and eventually many of the functions will become commoditized as they mature.<p>In the meantime, I think it makes sense for HFT market participants to be sensitive to the fact that many individual market participants have trouble identifying the value they've received because of HFT participation, but can clearly remember fears that have been induced by HFT driven events.",1335466481
3895552,comment,3894404,3895358,6,0,Stwerp,,,"> the christian academic community seems to be about the only one in which one can have a serious conversation about innate differences between the genders without getting immediately taken out and shot.<p>(Sorry, I don't mean to harp on this too much, but after hanging out around a sociologist with a pet peeve, it has sadly rubbed off on me.)<p>This may be because in the academic community ""gender"" has an entirely different meaning that ""sex."" Sex (and the sex differences) relate to biological differences, male and female. Gender (and gender differences) relate to society, culture, and how one acts or the roles of the masculine and feminine _within that society_. So of course ""gender differences"" are not going to turn up a lot in the academic world since a self-identifying masculine male should have the same biology as a self-identifying feminine male. Googling for ""sex brain difference"" or something like that may help (in google scholar or a journal database, probably not plain google).<p>One other data point is that it is worth investigating women in technology in other societies. According to this (old) study: <a href=""http://www.frauen.inf.ethz.ch/stats/international_stat_frauen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frauen.inf.ethz.ch/stats/international_stat_fraue...</a> women are in the majority for a few asian countries.<p>Just some thoughts.",1335466447

If it's the ability to select elements based on the value of the 'style' attribute, then it would be something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  //book[@style='someclass']\n</code></pre>\nIf that's the case, then that's not what I'd want to do, if I could improve things (even though it would still be possible to do so). Here, the model is coupled with the style, because your model refers to a 'class'. Why would it refer to a class in the presentation? It's essentially saying: ""render me this way"". Your model should worry about the data, not the style. Why not decouple them, by letting the stylesheet select elements in the model, not the other way around?<p><pre><code>  //book[filter by some property or id]\n</code></pre>\nPresumably, if there's a class for a <book>, then there's something that makes that <book> different from other elements, which warranted a different style class. In that case, instead of assigning a 'class', just assign an ID or use some other attributes (or child elements) to figure out the uniqueness.<p>If by 'class selectors' you're referring to the collection of styling attributes and the way those would be filtered and overridden, then you could define something like:<p><pre><code>  <axr:style id='style1'>\n    <color>#ff0</color>\n    <background color=""purple""/>\n  </axr:style>\n\n  \n  <axr:style>\n    <axr:include ref='style1'/>\n    <color>#000</color> <!-- override the color -->\n  </axr:style>\n\n</code></pre>\nFiltering/overriding qualities are similar to XSL's xsl:import / xsl:include. The @ref could be @href instead, and could refer to elements in other documents (a-la XPointer/XInclude):<p><pre><code>  <axr:include href=""../foo.axr#style1""/>\n</code></pre>\nClearly, this requires more thought than I've given it while writing the comment, but I hope this is what you were asking about.",1335465166

My spider-sense also tingles a little, which makes me think this is part of some infernal ""run-up"" to a war with Iran.<p>Empirically, I just don't buy it.  Sure, Iran is a menace, but they have spent the last 50 years (yes, under the Shah as well) trying to stamp out the kind of free-form anarchism that makes the best hackers.  I mean, they've got the idea of doing a heavily-snooped and censored ""halal internet"" for their own purposes. That sort of censorship is just not conducive to producing native black-hat hackers.<p>Why, just the other day, there was an HN story about some Iranian who found a vuln in all the major Iranian bank's software.  He notified them, got ignored, demonstrated the vuln with 30,000 back accounts, got ignored, then dumped <i>all</i> the bank's account info.  Then left the country. Does this sound like a culture that can produce ""CyberWarriors""? It does not to me.<p>And before anyone brings it up, yes, Red China has a huge hacker/honker population.  They also have a population of 1.3 billion.  They have a huge population of X, for any value of X. Iran has a population of 73 million that's roundoff error in China's population.

Suppose that I am willing to buy at $10.20.<p>In today's market I will immediately make the trade at $10.05.<p>In my suggested market there is another fact to consider, the price.  Suppose that it is $10.03.  Then I become an outstanding buy order, and for as long as I am outstanding, the price will drift up.  If the price reaches $10.05 without finding a seller, then I will trade at $10.05 with the HFT folks.  But if a seller who is willing to sell at $9.90 comes along before that happens, we will trade with each other at the current price and leave the HFT folks out of the loop.<p>My suspicion is that, if this were implemented, a large fraction of trades would actually execute in the middle ground between what the HFT traders are willing to offer as a bid/ask.  Therefore this would be even better for actual speculators than the current system.  HFT players would still be in that market, but they would not be as important.<p>In short the difference with my system is that trades may have a small delay before they execute, but should execute at the same or better price for me than the existing market mechanism.",1335463405

3895294,comment,3894302,3894302,13,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"OK, answer me this: How does an HFT, <i>in practice</i>, add liquidity to a market? None of the examples given showed liquidity being added, because the people involved would have traded with each other directly without an HFT being there.<p>Further, I submit that any HFT will only place a buy/sell spread in the case where the volume is high enough that they can complete their purchases within seconds or at most minutes.<p>At best an HFT will cut a few minutes (more often seconds) off of the time of a trade. Anyone who is worried about waiting a few minutes for a trade to complete is Doing It Wrong. Therefore, the ""liquidity"" HFTs provide is <i>only</i> in the cases where it's not truly needed because the volume is high enough to provide it anyway.<p>I've traded in a lot of stocks where there was very little liquidity, and fewer than a few dozen trades would happen per day. I'd sometimes wait hours for a trade to complete. Where are all the HFTs providing me ""liquidity""? They weren't anywhere to be found, because in the cases where the volume is too low HFTs can't make a sure bet. And when the volume is high, they aren't needed. So what good are they again? At any point that an HFT is willing to buy stock, it's because there's a <i>high</i> likelihood that someone will show up to pay more after a few seconds or minutes.<p>IMO the popular media actually has it right. HFTs really are just stealing pennies on every transaction, because they only enter a stock and ""add liquidity"" if and when the stock doesn't need it.<p>The onus isn't on me to prove they aren't providing liquidity, but on the HFTs to prove they are, and the OA doesn't even come close. In <i>every example</i> OP gives, the people actually buying and/or selling stock would have been better off without the HFTs in the mix (at best their trades were a few minutes faster).<p>If we just taxed or put a fee on a ""short term hold"" of a stock, say less than one day, then high frequency trading would vanish.

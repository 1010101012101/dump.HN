2479168,comment,2478669,2478669,3,0,Aaronontheweb,,,"I think C# and ASP.NET MVC has some of the best options available as far as OR/Ms go. Dapper, which was open sourced by the StackOverFlow team, is something I just started using and it took me all of 5 minutes to pick up. It allows you to still write your own custom SQL statements but maps everything to a family of POCO objects you want to use. Dapper is also the fastest OR/M in C# terms of its benchmarks if that's a concern for you.<p>LINQ-to-SQL is another great option that's easy to set up and actually performs pretty well if you compile the queries.<p>Fluent NHibernate is much heavier duty, but once you have all of your mappings set up then it's braindead easy to do anything to your database.<p>If you're using Mongo in C# then I highly recommend checking out the NoRM project - it's like LINQ-to-SQL for Mongo.

If this behaviour changes across all browsers, wouldn't that solve this problem?<p>Another ""hack"" to solve the caching problem would be to have multiple random lookup records (say server-$random.hostname.com) all result in multiple lookups that cannot be cached?

I think the problem is more related to modularity. For instance I don't think it is the best policy to make a skip list implementation as simple as possible because it is self contained and will likely be used by many of my programs in the future. Complexity only becomes a problem when it is no longer possible for a developer to fit all the pieces of the program in her mind at once. Abstraction and modularity can generally help with this.",1303664237

2479158,comment,2464764,2467647,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"To a large extent, the ""God of the Gaps"" argument often made by skeptics is quite true. I say this as a deist who believes in a God. Nonetheless, it's obvious that throughout most of history, people have ascribed to God whatever they didn't understand (weather, geography, biology) and then removed ""him"" from the explanation once more precise understanding was available. In this light, it makes sense that people in the Bronze Age would believe in a God who's somewhat of a dick. If you believe that God is omnipotent and interventionist, and then watch innocent people get sick or trampled by elephants, you're going to think God is a jerk. We're more philosophically evolved than we were at that time, however, and can consider more possibilities that wouldn't have even occurred to people before the advent of modern philosophy circa 800-400 BC.<p>I believe in a God who is omnibenevolent but electively non-omnipotent on account of deliberate non-interventionism. I believe that free will exists, and possibly at a very low level (even a quantum level, perhaps). Free will makes the future nondeterministic and therefore it makes sense that God would pursue an evolutionary plan that is robust no matter how that free will is exercised. And since all the suffering and ""evil"" we experience comes from being evolved organisms at a rather low point in our arc, this doesn't contradict the concept of a benevolent God, <i>especially</i> if ""he"" settles the score at some point in the future (e.g. by allowing us to reincarnate into better forms, either in this world after they are produced by evolution and technology, or in another).",1303664161

2479141,comment,2479053,2479053,40,0,cletus,,,"This is a great headline-grabber but I still see landing a man on Mars as being an awful long way off.<p>I heard Jerry Pournelle talking about this and he said something like landing a man on the Moon and establishing a lunar colony is an engineering problem. Landing a man on Mars is a science problem.<p>The difference? We can already do the former. it's simply a question of money and the will to do it. The problems are basically solved.<p>Landing a man on Mars has far bigger problems. The round trip (or even one way) journey with current propulsion technology will take an incredibly long time (upwards of 2 years). How do you keep someone alive that long? What about the psychology of isolation? Sustained radiation exposure is a real problem.<p>Personally I see manned spaceflight, particularly to other planets, as being largely a propaganda exercise until:<p>1. The cost of lifting into orbit (per kg) goes down. Way down. Like 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude; and<p>2. We have a much faster means of propulsion to make journey lengths manageable.<p>(1) is probably the easiest to solve. SpaceX's launch prices are actually quite low (but those are fairly low orbits; launching to another planet is more expensive). Virgin Galactic and other private suborbital efforts will (hopefully) lead to a dramatic cost reduction of getting into orbit.<p>(2) is a fundamentally hard problem. Ideas such as solar sails and the like are far from being practical (plus with a solar sail, how do you get back?). Magnetic fields as solar sails is an interesting idea but has a whole bunch of other problems.<p>Otherwise you need to eject mass to give you velocity. That mass is something you have to carry. The more mass (fuel) you carry, the less effective each gram is (in delta-V terms).<p>What I think will probably drive this is the coming earthbound resource shortages (inevitable unless we drastically reduce population; it's simply a question of when) that will drive a permanent presence in space. Once you have a huge industrial manufacturing capacity in space, the economics completely change.<p>EDIT: I agree with other comments in that a one-way (colonization) mission makes far more sense but I'm still unconvinced this will happen anytime soon, probably not in my lifetime.<p>Mars does have some interesting properties though if a colony can become self-sustaining:<p>1. Lower gravity. This actually makes the idea of a space elevator far more feasible [1]; and<p>2. Mars has features that extend beyond the atmosphere. The atmosphere is ~11km thick. Olympus Mons is 25km high.<p>I've read seemingly informed speculation that if we (the human race) had evolved on Mars, we'd already be heavily spacebound since it would be far, far easier.<p>This is what might justify colonizing Mars. Not that that is an easy problem.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=95924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=95924</a>",1303663673

2479134,comment,2477855,2477855,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"I like Ocaml for these reasons. It's actually a very simple language and has the C-like elegance. If you already know a few programming languages and can ""think functionally"", you can pick it up in about a week.<p>C's major win, in its time, was context-independence: people could drop into a 200,000-line C project and have a good idea of what the code they're looking at is doing. And if C code has been written well, it's not hard to look further if needed. This is not really possible when metaprogramming features like self-modifying code and insane macros are pulled out. Lisp is great in the right hands, but I've seen undisciplined ""rock star"" programmers produce write-only code in it and that's ugly.<p>Ocaml also has this context-independence, but it has most of the power of a language like Lisp, it's statically typed and functional, but it's pretty much the minimally complex language that has that power. It loses on libraries, but as far as the language itself goes, it's one of the best languages out there.",1303663513

Their stated goal is to deliver freedom to software users, but in my opinion they've totally failed at this in recent years by sticking to the GPL, which at this point does more harm than good.<p>First of all, the GPL creates an unhealthy incentives structure. In GPL software, there's little incentive to add the features that end-users need. Corporations can afford to pay developers to add features to GPL software, but end users don't stand a chance. Most developers will build the features they personally find most useful, and because of this there are very few GPL-licensed pieces of software that have superior usability for non-technical users when compared to proprietary alternatives. If a feature isn't necessary for the developers personally, it faces an uphill battle to get into the software.<p>But let's discount that discussion and assume that it's true that an open license produces software whose fitness for purpose matches that of closed software, for all users. Even in that case the GPL isn't helping.<p>Suppose facebook released their entire codebase under the GPL tomorrow. Would it actually make their users any more free? Would the risk of privacy intrusion be any less? Would it be easier to set up a competing platform? That's three times no in my book. The GPL's freedom, that you can build any software you want with it, is its biggest deficiency. By not including a standard of ethics in the license itself, developers are free to add user-hostile features. As long as you could fork the project to remove those features, this wasn't an issue, but what use would it be to fork facebook's code?<p>The FSF's only recourse at this point to achieve their long-term goal of user freedom is to go back to the drawing board and develop a new GPL-incompatible license that enforces a code of conduct on the part of the users _and_ developers of the software (not just a license but a contract). Basically they need to three-laws-ify software licenses. You can only exercise your freedom to adapt the software in so far that you don't hurt the freedom of others. I don't know if someone like stallman has the mental agility to make this strategy shift though, so I suspect the FSF will remain largely irrelevant to the future battle between free and closed.",1303662724

Also, you would not believe the extent to which Indians and Pakistanis would go to demonstrate their love for each other.

I reckon it'd be market suicide for an ISP to cut off access to the web without paying more, so some mix of faster/better/cheap/preferential for the most popular sites or lower bandwith content would be okay with me.<p>Net neutrality sounds decent enough, but the government tends to pass laws while they're hot button issues that become arcane bureaucracy later.

The only difference is that once you've mangled your algorithm, you get to proudly signpost it by wrapping it in a recur.  It doesn't help the machine at all, it just helps the user.  Sounds like a job for... comments!<p>(More specifically, recur only works in situations where TCO would have happened automatically in Scheme---and not even all of those, as other commentors have pointed out.

Cyc is an attempt to create an ontology that describes the world.<p>You are right that a lot of these ""glob everything together"" ontologies inevitably get too unwieldy to actually use. And wouldn't be so far off saying that OWL itself is a bit hard to grok. But it is important to see what the difference is. What is important about something like OWL, OWL-DL, or OWL Light is that they specify the <i>types of axioms</i> you are allowed to use. For example, the following statements are very different:<p>- Humans have exactly two biological parents<p>- Humans must have biological parents<p>- Humans must have biological parent(s)<p>- Humans can have parent(s)<p>OWL, and its subsets, are attempts to carve out logical axioms that allow you to specify the nature of conceptual classes and their properties. You need a framework such as OWL to spell out what you are allowed to state about concepts like this because different types of logical relationships have algorithmic complexity implications. What you are allowed to state is incredibly important to people who want to perform logical inference, for example, because certain types of axioms will take a dataset on which inference would otherwise be O(P) time, and turn it to O(NP) time.",1256710011

I can see how that is sometimes the case, but I don't see how that is always or even commonly the case.  In many conflicts, there are very real underlying issues that need to be resolved and unless those fundamental imbalances are addressed, then there will not be peace.<p>For example, it looks like China is on a possible collision course with India and Southeast Asian nations over water rights.  China's north is heavily populated, rapidly growing, and severely short of water.  Tibet on the other hand is very rich in water resources that are upstream of major rivers in India, Laos, Vietnam, etc.  As we speak there are gigantic projects diverting water from China's south to the north.  It's likely not to be enough, and if China moves on to divert and dam rivers that cross international borders, there will likely be war.<p>This is just one example, but my guess would be that a resource-driven conflict that incites national pride on both sides will break those friendships rather than the other way around.  If the fundamental reasons driving a conflict are not resolved, it's hard to see why friendships will be able to prevent war.",1256709605

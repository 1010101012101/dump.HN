Claiming Instagram was a bad turn is just purely naive conjecture by people who delude themselves into thinking they have the magic map.<p>All we know is, more people than most countries' populations are using this invention to make their lives better.

Maybe they have to commute further, or work shifts they don't prefer.  There is a small segment of the workforce that can improve its productivity just by showing up on time.  Some folks will have to make more drastic changes, such as moving.  Many people moved to Florida to build houses that, as it turns out, no one wants.  Those people won't find construction work in Florida but might well find it in North Dakota, which is currently going bonkers.<p>And they can seek retrainings that might seem marginal.  Maybe they learn to weld, or operate a crane.  A semi-literate adult who buckles down achieve actual literacy probably opens very large possiblities for productivity gains.<p>So moving up the productivity curve doesn't mean learning 55 year olds learning Python.  It can mean finding a way to do 5%, 10% 20% better.<p>That said, I have to agree that improving productivity is a lot easier for people with sound education and training to begin with.  One of our great problems is the failure of our schooling culture to properly prepare people to understand and learn new things.<p>EDITED TO ADD:\nAlso, I don't want to sound ignorant of all the difficulties of this.  Some gains are easily achieved, some are hard won but worthwhile for non-economic reasons.  And some of the sacrifices required are pretty hard.  It is one thing for economists to talk about ""labor mobility"" as a factor driving productivity, and another for those who find they have to move half-way across the country.",1342298773

That was <i>my worst Product idea ever</i>, hands down.

Two accounts <i>ever</i>, in six months, actually saved their email addresses and then, some time later, paid for the software.  (This was at least partially because I did not roadblock users at any point and e.g. ask for an email address with a greyed-out Skip option, which is a virtual necessity to get gradual engagement to work.  #microUXtip)  I have no email addresses for guest accounts nor permission to contact them, something which I have in abundance for trial accounts, and I can tell you that is worth a good deal of money over the long run.<p>Optimizely and Stripe are, indeed, the <i>two</i> YC companies that I can think of which do gradual engagement.  The mafia are very generous with what they know, have an active mailing list, and are universally capable of knocking out a gradual-engagement enabled account system within a week or two.  What does this suggest to you as to internal sentiments regarding gradual engagement?<p>If you want to do something like this, use a <i>post-signup</i> fully capable account for a product tour.

Sometimes its magic has been overplayed, but still...<p>>> Evidence shows that Emacs' packages can go beyond Vim's\n> Would love to look at some of that evidence. Apart from async stuff(debuggers, slime etc), I don't think that should be the case. I have looked at Tim Pope's and scrooloose's vim plugins, and have reasonable experience writing vimscript and looking at others' work to believe vimscript is powerful enough for the job.<p>What about:\n- Gnus, RM, VM, Vanderlust, Meow:  mail readers (IMO an aberration, but it proves the point);\n- Eshell (Emacs shell, written in Emacs Lisp);\n- Dired, Sunrise Commander: file browsers;\nNone of these packages uses functionality which is alien to Vim, except a more expressive extension language and a richer library.<p>> <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/emacs/go-mode.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse/misc/emacs/go-mode...</a>.\n> \n> Look at the syntax highlighting section 28-107 and show me where it's parsing go code. I don't know what you meant by ""parse and understand code"", but a parser for a non-toy language isn't something you write in elisp for a syntax highlighter.<p>That's a basic Emacs mode. Throw some Perl code to both CPerl in Emacs and to Vim and see which of the two copes better (with Perl you can't do better than coping).<p>>> Vim Script code is difficult to read because uses keyboard macros heavily, and suffers from accumulated cruft, where equivalent Emacs code would use named procedures with meaningful and consisten names.<p>> It is difficult to read to whom? Unless it is difficult to read to someone who knows vimscript, it doesn't matter.<p>It is difficult to read to everyone.   There is a reason for we using named variables instead of codes of registers nowadays.<p>> You are missing the point. When I am in the editor, and I need to copy 2 words, I do y2w. Making it a function call in vimscript isn't beneficial to me at all.<p>What happens if the reader has remapped such keys on his Vim? I don't know, but either your code will break or the user will risk misunderstanding it. Maybe Vim doesn't offer you any facility to easily convert keyboard macros to named procedures, therefore you have to resort to hardcode such macros.<p>What if the reader uses a subset of Vim's commands and doesn't recognize the hard-coded macro at first sight? She has to decrypt it. In Emacs Lisp, you always have at least clue about what a command does.<p>>> Unless you have objective proof of ""emacs being much more consistent and flexible(where, how)"" it's not objective at all.<p>That Emacs is more flexible, I have proved. Documenting why Emacs is more consistent would be more work than I'm willing to put into a comment here.  Since I have studied both Vim and Emacs and read experiences of users who have switched from one to the other, both ways, I believe I have a good idea about how they stack one against the other. I accept that you don't share my opinion.<p>>> Back to work ;-)<p>> The only thing that matters.<p>But a flame war is often a welcomed distraction.<p>Cheers.",1342296509

Historically, if you&#x27;re part-Han (a term which originated from the Han Dynasty to be an inclusive term that described all the diverse people from the diverse nations that comprised it), then you&#x27;re Han (part of the mainstream, dominant culture). Historically, in the U.S., children of mixed race get categorized with the less-mainstream less-dominant minority culture, with all the lack of privilege that accompany that. This sort of edge case may seem minor to those who don&#x27;t live it, but as an edge case myself, I feel that it&#x27;s indicative of how the dominant culture views me.",1447138484

A party can&#x27;t just show &quot;<i>any</i>&quot; source of statistical data showing arbitration is unfair. If they run to court, in most cases, all the other party has to do to succeed in a motion to compel arbitration is establish that an arbitration agreement exists, applies, and meets the minimum procedural requirements for arbitration under the FAA.

How to do sensible scoping of logical components has been something I&#x27;ve been trying to rethink recently. Currently, you can read through text and imagine the logical components. But it&#x27;d be interesting to see more discussion put into modes of visual expressions, especially when combined with more textual information.<p>What would you classify as easy to associate referential steps? I&#x27;ve been using html5 components to combine hierarchical structure while being able to still use manual id/herd to provide the occasional &quot;slice&quot; outside the normal data stack. However, it still requires modifying a textual code stack.<p>Also the aspect oriented programming part sounds interesting. Did you ever try having &quot;behavioral subnodes&quot; which modify the parent node? I found it to be powerful, but only when used in a hierarchical data flow pattern. Though I haven&#x27;t built the gui side of that approach yet.<p>Thanks for the feedback.

It&#x27;s also pretty clear that damage is being done by the dramatic erosion of privacy in the digital age because so far the capabilities of new technologies have far out-stripped the social and regulatory debates around it. Unfortunately, a big part of the problem is that many people have little idea of what is happening with personal data about them and even less understanding of the potential consequences unless they&#x27;ve been the unlucky one who really was a victim of, say, identity theft. Consequently the opinion polls tend to show most people not being that bothered by organisations like Facebook, even though when fully informed or after widely reported leaks with many victims potentially affected you tend to see quite different opinions being expressed.",1447135989

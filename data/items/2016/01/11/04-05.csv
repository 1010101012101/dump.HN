10878878,comment,10878623,10878623,0,0,lelandbatey,,,"The entire premise of this article is that tools like NVM are &quot;apps&quot;, which is interesting for me. I do not think of software like NVM or node as &#x27;apps&#x27;, as much as I think of them as &#x27;tools&#x27;. And for me, the entire point of a tool is that contrary to point 4, you are expected to read the manual before using them. A tool has little in the way of safeguards, and it doesn&#x27;t presume to know what you want. It does what it was designed to do, and you are expected to understand what it does and doesn&#x27;t do.<p>For example, the problems had with NVM are nearly all explained by reading the README[0] which on my laptop is ~6 screens of medium size text. If perused, it would explain how to install versions of node, how to enable different version, and how to set default global versions.<p>Now, the question is &quot;why is it the case that tools aren&#x27;t expected to be as simple to use as apps?&quot; I believe the answer is because anticipating and guiding a user through learning that tool takes a ton of time and energy, much more time and energy than your average open source developer has. Additionally, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to break things like automation of command line tools in an effort to cleverly anticipate and guide a user.<p>Most importantly, I&#x27;d like to remind everyone that this is open source software and you are more than welcome to attempt to change it. For example, NVM is a ~2000 line bash script; making some of the simpler changes you bring up (such as improved help messages and suggestions) is well within the grasp of a single person with an afternoon.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss the author&#x27;s points: the software mentioned is frequently frustrating to use, and can be extremely unhelpful. I&#x27;ve struggled with nearly all the same ones brought up in this post. However, it&#x27;s not as though these where tools designed by Apple for the everyman; they where built by engineers under time pressures with an intended audience of other engineers, and if you think they should be different you are welcome to bring that change.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://github.com/creationix/nvm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/creationix/nvm</a>",1452487857

10878858,comment,10877411,10877411,0,0,petke,,,"Quite frankly, Im surprised the reason behind this isnt common knowledge, at least among us geeks.<p>The reason is hardware designers have hit a wall, they cant make single threaded applications run any faster.<p>So your brand new gaming PC is no faster at running single core applications than your 10 year old computer is. You can copy over any single core application from your new PC to your old one, and it will run just as fast.<p>What your new computer has is more cores though. Ideally you want linear scaling. That is if you have 2 cores your program should run twice as fast, and if you have 256 it should run 256 times as fast. This kind of scaling is almost impossible to achieve. Most programs don&#x27;t scale beyond a certain number of cores.<p>Your multithreaded program might run a bit faster if you throw an extra core at it, but very quickly throwing more cores at it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. It might even get slower. You have all those extra cores idle, or worse they are busy waiting.<p>Most programs dont scale well to many cores because any synchronization between cores kill scalability. If you have ANY sequential steps in your application that will put a limit on scalability.<p>As an example say you have 4 cores. You have a main loop  on one core, it posts expensive work to the other (3) cores. And when they are done, you collect all the results and use them somehow. This final step is sequential and it kills your scaling. Your application wont run 4 times faster. And it probably wont run any faster if you throw 16 cores at it. This is because that one core is synchronizing with all the other cores. So those other cores do a lot of waiting around. And any sequential steps in that one core becomes the bottleneck, as those other cores will all end up waiting for it.<p>This message is already too long. So long story short. Single threaded programs are no faster on new computers, and most multi threaded programs dont scale well to many cores. Its a huge wasted opportunity to let cores be idle or underutilized. We have to fundamentally change our programming style and tools to take make use of all available cores.<p>More info by Herb Sutter:<p><a href=""http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm</a><p><a href=""http://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://herbsutter.com/welcome-to-the-jungle/</a>",1452487447

The company’s net cash — or cash minus debt — is $4.2 billion. All told, that is $45.3 billion.<p>But stock market investors are assigning a valuation of $32.5 billion, based on Wednesday’s trading. The news that Yahoo was halting a spinoff of its stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, choosing instead to explore a spinoff of Yahoo’s core Internet operations plus its stake in Yahoo Japan, sent shares lower, widening that gap.<p>On average, analysts value Yahoo’s core based on five times projected Ebitda – some a little higher, some a little lower. That yields a market capitalization of $4.6 billion if Yahoo were an independent company. Tack on the 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, worth about $8.6 billion, and you’ve got a $13.2 billion business that could be spun out.<p>If the transaction ultimately is taxed, the bill would be a lot smaller for the Yahoo core plus Yahoo Japan entity than the original plan to spin off its Alibaba stake. Assuming a 41 percent tax rate, as CRT did in Wednesday’s note, Yahoo would pay $5.4 billion in taxes, versus $13.3 billion in taxes if it spun out Alibaba – potential savings that amount to $8 billion. That’s an extra dollar back for each share outstanding. Yet, interestingly, the stock lost 45 cents a share Wednesday.</i>",1452486313

I just want to transpile and bundle my app, not program a build tool by clobbering together 100 libraries. Grunt was okay, but it was slow and required lots of configuration. Not much worked out of the box without downloading plugins.<p>Gulp was much much worse. Nothing worked at all out of the box and months later I still hadn&#x27;t found the patience to get everything working right. Documentation was next to non-existent and there were points where I wanted to rip my hair out trying to work around &quot;vinyl source streams&quot;, whether I needed a buffer or not, how to wrap a regular stream, how to get live reload to work, figure out why they had &quot;blacklisted&quot; popular modules that just made it easy to plug things in. At least it was fast but I never did get it working for some of the things I wanted to do and fell back on grunt sometimes.<p>Webpack is somewhat better I suppose but at this point I&#x27;m just prepared to be disillusioned every time I try some new javascript package which has maybe nulled the pain to some extent.<p>It isn&#x27;t even that doing this stuff would be that difficult it&#x27;s just that the docs are usually wrong, missing, incompatible, or outdated. No one bothers to fix them because by the time they do the JS community has just chugged along to the next &quot;framework&quot; leaving a trail of broken and abandoned projects in its wake.<p>I don&#x27;t give a damn about bloat and modularity. Most of the time I&#x27;m just looking for a quick solution. If I have to download a big package so be it. Do everyone a favor and package things together that are compatible and work together so I don&#x27;t have to spend hours tracking down the proper module for doing something like compiling sass and then another hour figuring out how to configure it and insert it into the build tool.<p>If I wanted to work on build tools then I would work on build tools but I get so tired of doing this stuff each time I need to set something up. In theory it sounds nice for there to be a million ways of getting something done but in practice I think it&#x27;s just easier for someone to set a precedent for doing it one way and then have the community work on incremental improvements to that one way of doing things. This eliminates a load of confusion, incompatibility, and excess work.<p>All this might be an unpopular opinion but when I&#x27;m working on a project I like to direct my time towards the project, not the supporting development tools.",1452486281

It&#x27;s a test of statistical significance, it doesn&#x27;t try to say if that significance is because x causes y or y causes x or some unknown variable z causes both y and x.<p>The long version: So, in this case, we have two variables, Metacritic score (or Rotten Tomatoes percentage) and box office gross. We have measured the correlation between them for some number N of movies. N is smaller than the total population of movies that could be evaluated; if nothing else, the analysis doesn&#x27;t consider movies that haven&#x27;t been released yet. So the movies evaluated are considered, for the purposes of a p-value test, to be a sample of size N from a hypothetical infinite population of movies with box office gross and Metacritic scores. The p-value test also assumes that there&#x27;s something called a null hypothesis, which is that there is no relationship between Metacritic scores and box office gross. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that all other hypothesises (is that the right plural? I don&#x27;t know) are evaluated against.<p>What the p-value measures (in this case, it can be applied to other statistics as well) is the probability of seeing a correlation of that size or greater given a random sample of N observations if the null hypothesis is true. What&#x27;s notable about this is that the p-value is not testing anything about any hypothesis other than the null hypothesis -- it can be used as evidence about the likelihood of the null hypothesis being true, but past that it has nothing to say about any OTHER hypothesis. Which is why it&#x27;s wrong to say that a p-value test is evidence of a causal relationship -- it&#x27;s not even trying to test that.",1452485301

However, the examples of the managed memory languages also rely on language level Virtual Machines and/or JITs (which are critical to achieving excellent performance in those respective languages). Then, the article points out that the people using these &quot;garbage collected languages&quot; (which are also JITed (in a VM likely)) tend to have problems debugging performance issues. If he&#x27;s right, then the examples aren&#x27;t making the case very convincingly because the realm of languages with garbage collection isn&#x27;t divided granularly enough in his analysis. The result is attributing the problem to a common language feature that they all share, without acknowledging that they also all share other very important features.<p>I&#x27;d never claim that understanding memory usage/allocation/freeing isn&#x27;t important. It&#x27;s important to understand how memory is used whether that be understanding how your collector handles generations of memory in a GC&#x27;d language, or whether it be understanding how your programming patterns cause a waterfall of destructor chains in a manually managed language. Often, understanding these things is difficult.<p>My claim was that, in my experience, the <i>biggest</i> difficulties in debugging performance were in understanding JIT heuristics in language level Virtual Machines. This is because (especially in dynamic languages) the heuristics aren&#x27;t documented anywhere, they&#x27;re subject to change, and are likely not consistent between particular runtimes you&#x27;re hosted within. (Those optimizations you made just for V8, could even <i>hurt</i> perf if you run your library in JSC).<p>There&#x27;s also the issue with language level virtual machines in that they usually impose some system wide tax on many operations (a layer of indirection), so I could see the people mentioned in the article having a hard time squeezing out that last portion of performance due to that indirection - again, that might be the fault of there being a language level Virtual Machine - and not necessarily as much related to memory (it depends on your application, and amount you allocate, of course).<p>In my experience, optimizing collection behavior has been relatively straightforward in comparison and the techniques you learn for one collector seem to translate to others. Perhaps my experience is biased towards JIT/VM/GC in dynamic languages where the JITs are so much more complex in comparison.<p>I have seen core hot paths in critical client side JS libraries be slowed down 9x because of obscure JIT deopts caused by properties names beginning with a dollar sign. I&#x27;m not just talking about a 9x slowdown of field lookups - our entire end to end benchmarks tanked (since fixed). Perhaps the VM architects decided that something with a leading dollar sign would not likely benefit from being made into a hidden JIT class? I&#x27;ve never had anything so obscure happen with any kind of garbage collection, whether that be reference counted ARC, or a tracing collector.\nEdit: spelling",1452485216

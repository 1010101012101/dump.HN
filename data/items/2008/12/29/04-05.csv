The theory of pseudorandom generators is very well understood; and cryptographic PRNGs even come with the guarantee that there is no known way to tell the difference between its output and a truly random string. All you need, then, is 80 bits of true randomness as a seed for RC4.<p>Of course there have been instances when random number generators have been broken, such as Netscape's SSL once upon a time, but that was because it used a non-random seed (the timestamp), and not because of a weakness in the algorithm.<p>And this is all w.r.t. a malicious attacker. Simulations don't even come close to testing the limits of random number generators (in a provable way; Michael Mitzenmacher has a paper on this), and the Mersenne twister is in all likelihood sufficient. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_twister</a><p>It's really cool that they broke the true-randomness bandwidth record, but does every discovery in materials science these days have to be justified with potential applications to computing?",1230526463

412635,comment,412465,412465,0,0,mdasen,,,"There are definitely toy languages.  lolcode is definitely a toy.<p>On a serious note, people dislike PHP because many of the language choices seem to have been made oddly to put it nicely.  It's also domain specific.  While I wouldn't want to play a 3D game written in Python or Ruby, they're programming languages that you can make whatever in.  When someone tries to make a desktop app in PHP, it's just odd.  PHP is a language in the way that JSP is.  It's wonderfully useful for web stuff, but it's not a programming language made for everything - just web stuff.<p>And, to be honest, PHP does a lot of things that really aren't good practice if you're doing something other than creating a domain specific language.  Like, you connect to a database with mysql_connect() and then run queries with mysql_query() and you don't have to pass in a link identifier unless you're querying a new DB.  It completely isolates programmers from the reality of how variables like that get managed in memory.  It's not a bad thing when you're just trying to get something done, but it also means that PHP people have no idea what a local static variable is and what that means (maybe it clings to you after you run the laundry?).<p>Likewise, a lot of programming is dealing with scope.  PHP tends to muddle scope with globals in a way that can be convenient for web programs, but also means that you get a lot of people that don't know program design messing around in it.<p>Similarly, PHP isolates users from types more than most scripting languages.  What's false?  Who knows?  It's actually a problem as 0 == 'apple' returns true.  Yep.  Integer zero is equal to any string.  While I'm not a typist, I do think there are problems when you muddle too much casting to different types automatically.<p>In terms of Python/Perl/Ruby, well, some people are against scripting languages.  They're slower than something like C or Java and want to be snotty about the relaxed programming they offer.  Plus, well, you don't find C programmers that don't understand things like garbage collection or algorithm performance standards.  Sometimes in the scripting world there are a bunch of cut/paste, keep trying something until it works programmers.  They don't know what they're doing and stumble along not realizing why something works or doesn't.  How many scripting programmers have thought about references vs. copies?<p>A lot of it is people being snotty about things, but a lot of programmers really don't understand programming.  So, whatever.  People call things names.  It's going to happen whether they're geniuses or idiots.",1230526142

[1] Bill Gates was a <i>hacker</i> before he knew anything about money or business. Wikipedia:<p><i>After his [high school] administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with mostly female students. He later stated that ""it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success."" At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called Traf-O-Data, to make traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor...<p>...Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it... MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, was a success...<p>...During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, he personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.</i><p>Gates is not an isolated example. Who founded Apple Computer? Hackers. (Yes, Steve Jobs may be more famous as a manager than as a hacker, but in the early days he built stuff, too.) Google: Founded by computer scientists. Yahoo, ditto. eBay: founded by a programmer. Jeff Bezos of Amazon: comp sci degree.<p>You're better off knowing more journalism than programming? That's funny. Journalism is in flames, with senior reporters losing jobs by the score. One of the big reasons for this is that a lot of the money in newspaper publishing came from classified ads, and this money has been sucked away by a tiny company called Craigslist, founded by... a software engineer and comp sci major from my alma mater, Craig Newmark, a man with no background in journalism!<p>You are correct, though: Most people would agree that these folks are no longer best described as <i>programmers</i>. Society agrees that ""programmer"" is a word for assembly-line workers with no demonstrated creative powers, just as ""hacker"" is a word for 13-year-old script kiddies with criminal intent. Which is why many programmers are smart enough to come up with a new job title and/or a broader skill set after a few years on the job.<p>---<p>[1] Recommended: <i>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution</i>.

I'd program at work, and then I'd come home and read books on programming, architecture, etc. When I didn't feel like that, I'd be learning a new language. When I didn't feel like doing that, I'd be writing some software to do this or that.<p>I want to continue to get better as much as ever, but now most of what I see, I've already seen. New things to learn come by less frequently than they did before. It's not that people in their 40's and 50's give up and just coast, it's that it's a case of diminishing returns.<p>Once you know a decent amount of languages, you see the commonalities and the point of it begins to fade, and how many books can you read on OOP or functional programming? Good coding style? Project management? When you're at the phase when every sentence in the book is a worthwhile lesson it's easy to learn fast.

I think this is clearly not the case. The aggressiveness of their negotiating tactics and their willingness to potentially get sued for copyright infringement relate to the context of my question about whether YC startups lack grit.<p>You are asking me for ""specific examples of a YC startup not being ruthless"". But I am asking for the inverse - examples of aggressiveness. I haven't seen any at YC. Have you? Perhaps you don't believe it's necessary or important but that was the premise of my original question. I insist that this is not a troll but a sincere question and an important one in the current economic environment, even more especially for companies not privileged by YC funding.",1230523339

It might be able to target its ads better and to get high click through rates, but also needs to serve a lot of low value searches so I cannot see how it can make enough to justify a valuation that is anywhere close to a positive return.",1230523231

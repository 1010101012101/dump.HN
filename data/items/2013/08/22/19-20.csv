I think it was pretty experimental.<p>edit: there might have been a similar setup at Orly in France in 1997, come to think of it. The striking thing there was the soldiers with rifles (just 3 of them, but walking around) and the way they searched one of my grandmother&#x27;s bags when the x-ray showed something that looked like a grenade.

6259618,comment,6258188,6258363,1,0,stcredzero,,,"Here is how star rating actually works:<p>For a truly excellent product, the distribution should approximate a <i>power law graph</i>:<p><pre><code>    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n    XXXXXX\n    XX\n    X\n    X\n</code></pre>\nIf you see something like these:<p><pre><code>    XXXXXXX\n    X\n    X\n    X\n    X\n\n\n    X\n    X\n    X\n    X\n    XXXXX\n\n\n    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n    XXXXXX\n    XXX\n    X\n    XXXXXXXX\n\n</code></pre>\nThen ask yourself if the sample size makes this plausible, in which case the star rating isn&#x27;t worth much, because there isn&#x27;t enough data. Ask yourself if it&#x27;s possible that someone has been gaming the system for or against.<p>The uppercase gamma-shaped graph is either someone gaming the system or it&#x27;s a power law graph hidden by aliasing.

If I were Apple or Amazon, I would build stealth captchas and &quot;honeypot&quot; traps for ratings manipulation, and figure those into the rating. Be sure to separate detection from consequences by a random time interval of at least a few days.

6259615,comment,6258339,6259192,3,0,btilly,,,"By the Kelly criterion, you should bet edge/odds of your bankroll.  Your edge here is 0.01 * 0.0001 = 0.000001.  Your odds are 0.01.  Therefore you should bet 0.0001 of your net worth.  So if you had a million dollars, that $100 bet would be a sensible investment.  If you&#x27;ve only got, say, $100k then you should only bet for entertainment value.<p>The investment rule that underlies Kelly is to maximize the log of your net worth.  Why?  Bets multiply your net worth by a random factor, take logs and you&#x27;re adding a random factor.  In the long run a sum of independent random factors tends to converge to the expected value, so maximizing the expected log of your net worth will result in a strategy that with 100% odds will, in the long run, beat any other.",1377201204

Was immediately taken into another room with my carry-on, and had my checked-in luggage located and brought in as well.<p>A lot of things were very similar - I had the full pat down, the numerous questions, and everything was looked over.  However they did it all just once.  They took everything out of my bag and it was full of Christmas presents, which they then wanted to open, but I persuaded them to put them through the X-ray scanner still wrapped.<p>I also had a &#x27;guard&#x27; watching over me and making sure I didn&#x27;t leave, and multiple people coming in to ask me questions and verify my answers.<p>In the end they were able to X-ray all my stuff to their satisfaction, re-checked my bag, and I was was on my way in about 20-30 minutes.<p>They never did figure out why I set it off btw, and it&#x27;s never happened again.  Very strange.<p>The thing that sticks out to me from the experience, was how on alert everyone got once the explosive detector went off.  Suddenly everyone was _very_ uneasy and wary of me, especially when it came up positive a second time.<p>So although I think the recent incident was poorly handled, I do understand to some extent the measures in place - i.e. being taken away to another room to be checked, having all their stuff looked over, etc.<p>And although it seems nuts they didn&#x27;t let him leave, if he did show positive for explosives then what else should they have done?  It&#x27;s a difficult problem - surely they are compelled to investigate him if that happens?<p>Does anyone know if it would even be legal to search his place while he was away btw?

6259538,comment,6258188,6258482,3,0,will_brown,,,"This is an interesting 1st Amendment discussion (relating to the article...I am not touching the separate FDA/drug issue).<p>The most analogous case that comes to mind, is the recent California small claims case against Honda.<p>Facts:  According to the EPA (who independently tests vehicles fuel efficiency) the Prius gets an average of 51 MPG.  The Plaintiff claimed she only got an average of approximately 30 MPG.  The Plaintiff won the lawsuit against Honda for fraudulent misrepresentation winning $10K the small claims limit in the jurisdiction.  However, one of the most interesting arguments (and legitimate) was that while Honda does advertise the 51 MPG, that Honda could not be fraudulently misrepresenting the MPG, because Honda had no control over the testing or findings handled by the EPA, and going further Honda does not have a right (1st amendment) to contradict the &quot;EPA sticker&quot;.  Ergo according to the argument Honda should not be liable, rather the EPA - nevertheless the Court found Honda liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.<p>Assuming this law is on point and controlling, for example, if the Tesla were to under perform in a real crash and Tesla was sued, Tesla may be liable despite having no control over the NHTSA test or findings. Going further, if the dicta from the Honda case is also on point, if Tesla&#x27;s internal crash tests contradict NHTSA&#x27;s ratings, Tesla would not have a 1st Amendment right to contradict the NHTSA findings publicly.<p>Note:  That SCOTUS makes a distinction between &quot;commercial speech&quot; and other forms of speech, and the government has a lot more power to regulate commercial speech than say political speech.",1377200305

I had a lot of issues with D3 where it seemed like it wanted to be a domain specific language, but at some point decided to be a reimplementation of JS around some arbitrary starting point of thinking in R-like or HDF-like data frames or something, and then just got out of hand.<p>There are a <i>ton</i> of cool interpolation and features and such, and you can use them probably here and there without everything else from D3, and I have managed to do that on occasion. If someone were to make a debugger specifically for D3 or just generally say &quot;forget JavaScript and drink the coolaid and just copy our awesomeness and forget about making your own&quot; I think that would be in line with how D3 is presented. The composable part is spot on. I think OpenFrameworks also suffers from this. They demo their awesome thing and eventually make a library in OF, but as far as using OF itself to make that original awesomeness, that&#x27;s when one would just say &quot;well, I guess OF is cool for doing exactly what you see people doing with OF but anything more is just C++&quot; ... anyway.

A state law that required electors to be men or Methodists would surely be unconstitutional today. And as a result, there&#x27;s almost certainly an equal protection argument to be made against NPVIC: Sure, each individual voter is participating equally in a larger process to choose the President, but that&#x27;s not the process prescribed by the Constitution. The process demanded by the Constitution is a state-by-state selection of electors, and if a state legislature wants to have an election, it better be an election in which every voter <i>of that state</i> is participating equally. A thought experiment: Could the state of California pass a law that counted every vote for the electoral slate of the Democratic party twice? Surely not.

There is no worse feeling in the world than turning down work when unemployed because those jobs would have been huge steps backwards in my career.<p>One was with a college where I&#x27;d be rewriting the same web form in PHP with some rudimentary javascript every day--no growth opportunities.  One was with a custom automotive shop that hosted their website on phpBB and had the worst code imaginable as demonstrated to me on a programming test.  Another was with a web design firm that listed the most extreme political candidates in the state as its clients.   None of these jobs were accessible by transit, incidentally, and would have given me upwards of a 20 mile commute from downtown (the only place in the Phoenix area with a modicum of arts, culture, and entertainment options--and that&#x27;s about 0.001% of what the Bay Area can offer).<p>IMHO, it&#x27;s still 2006 in Phoenix&#x27;s web dev industry, with a bunch of crappy PHP jobs and maybe five Ruby on Rails jobs postings a year.  Companies that serve millions of users and are on the absolute cutting edge of technology simply do not exist in that town.  I am certain that my job, writing enterprise social media management software in Ruby on Rails does not exist in the state at all.<p>Practically speaking, the access to venture capital, tech journalism, and labor in San Francisco and Silicon Valley is utterly unmatched in the nation.<p>Personally speaking, my quality of life, partially because of a 43% higher paycheck (before bonuses) than I&#x27;d ever make in Phoenix is unmatched.  My rent might be three times as much, but I&#x27;ve more than made up for it in improvements to my social life, mental health, dating life, and about two dozen other factors.  The funny thing about expensive places to live is that they&#x27;re worth it.  Your idea that people have a better lifestyle in Phoenix compared to San Francisco is an absolute Dunning Krueger--there are FAR more factors to one&#x27;s quality of life than how big their house is.<p>When I talk to Californians about Arizona the only positive thing I heard was that somebody liked Sedona or Spring Training on vacation.  The vast majority said Phoenix was too hot and racist and couldn&#x27;t imagine living there for any reason.  I wouldn&#x27;t move back to Phoenix for a part time job that paid a half million a year.",1377198598

The FBI agent flat out said that it was about his race when he said &quot;a person of your background&quot;.<p>And explosive detectors are not really there to find bombs. They are there to reduce manual searches. If they just wanted to find bombs, they could just search everyone. Since that is impractical on multiple counts, the explosive detector is valuable because it narrows down the space. Once you have taken the person aside, searched them, searched their stuff, and come up with no additional evidence (&quot;brown&quot; isn&#x27;t evidence), it&#x27;s time to let them go.<p>Finally, this isn&#x27;t just about racism, but is also about the TSA and the cops being dangerously incompetent bullies. Instead of being polite and decent, they were rude and intimidating. Someone being reluctant and apprehensive under those circumstances is not strong evidence of wrongdoing.<p>And when they questioned him about the chemicals he had handled, they wouldn&#x27;t even tell him what they had found. That&#x27;s the kind of &quot;withholding information&quot; tactic you would use if you were <i>playing the role</i> of a detective without actually having any idea how to investigate. What purpose does it serve? If he <i>were</i> a terrorist, he&#x27;d know what chemicals were in his explosives. The only situation where that information is actually a secret is the one where the suspect is innocent.<p>In other words, they repeatedly created situations that either made guilt indistinguishable from innocence, or where they&#x27;d distinguish them inversely.

The American nuclear industry kinda caught up with that after Three Mile Island, when they figured out that one nuclear accident put them all at risk. They developed an extreme culture of safety after that.<p>Current designs use lots of redundant safety systems. New designs depend more on simple physics...eg., fuel that expands enough when it heats to damp down the reaction, or large quantities of coolant with very high thermal capacity and conductivity. At Argonne&#x27;s IFR project, they shut down coolant circulation and electric power, and the reactor quietly shut down with no damage.",1377198156

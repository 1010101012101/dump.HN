I don't think the flash is doing that much for you anyway.<p>But if you refuse, at least put something else where flash-less people see. My first impression of you was:<p><i>Alternate HTML content should be placed here.This content requires the Adobe Flash Player.Get Flash</i><p>which makes it look like you don't have the attention to detail to get rid of a stock message like that (and proves to me you didn't write it yourself).",1258213710

941774,comment,939355,939685,0,0,liscio,,,"It's probably the algorithm in question that's to blame, in conjunction with the slow OpenCL implementation for the 8800GT, as you found.<p>On my machine (I'm the article's author), even Apple's GPU-tuned version of Galaxies runs much faster on the Mac Pro's CPUs than the GPU.  So, something's up.  I think only the GTX285 for the Mac Pro beats out the CPUs on that test, but I could be wrong...<p>The 1-2 seconds of overhead could also be contributed to by the compilation of the OpenCL program for the GPU, as I do a compile of the .cl kernel on each run of the program.<p>Furthermore, I wasn't very scientific about the GPU case, because I wasn't planning to ship a GPU-tuned algorithm.  To actually pull this off for a consumer app is easier said than done.<p>For instance, I'd prefer not to ship the .cl kernel in the application, and would rather provide binary-compiled kernels.  Doing this for >1 flavor of GPU is nontrivial, from what I gather, as I'd have to actually own the GPUs in question to get compiles for the different targets (I could only cover the GeForce 9400M, and 8800GT from my own collection of hardware).<p>That said, I still want to stay open to the idea in the future as I play around with the algorithm, and understand it further.<p>Thanks for the nudge, though. I really should dig deeper.",1258213376

941771,comment,941740,941740,0,0,barrkel,,,"> ""Programming language quality is usually inversely proportional to the number of special forms""<p>Programming language obscurity is also usually inversely proportional to the number of special forms. Church numerals?<p>The happy place is somewhere in the middle, where there's enough language such that you don't have to build it out of other pieces - and this also helps with performance, static analysis, tooling, debugging and lots of other areas - but there isn't so much that you end up with lots of methods to do the same thing, in similar but incompatible ways.",1258213140
941770,comment,940683,940683,0,0,mark_l_watson,,,"I use Hadoop with custom map/reduce apps, but I am just experimenting a little with Pig, and playing with Hive is on my to-do list. I may change my mind on this, but I find the map/reduce model to be easy to work with, and development/debugging is fairly quick and easy running a single development Hadoop node.<p>BTW, I don't view Hadoop as only being useful for very large datasets. It seems reasonable to build automated Hadoop processing into a new application that has smaller data size requirements. You don't give up much in performance, and the extra development time is reasonable. Then you have lots of flexibility for scaling up. Also, if you only have sporadic needs to process large data sets, using Elastic MapReduce is very cost effective.",1258213007
941769,comment,941740,941740,0,0,kunley,,,"OTOH the Go authors made it clear that it's intended to replace C for the basic system programs & libs. I think that's step in the right direction.<p>I started to earn money using Erlang & Clojure, so looks like I'm not only fan of new exciting high-level langs but also quite an adopter of them in the so-called real world. Still there are some uses when a VM of your Chosen One language brings an unacceptable overhead. Imagine your daily work using vi, grep, find as they were compiled into jars and each running via JVM. Nightmare with that 2 seconds delay of starting each little proggy, isn't it? (Have you ever used the original Amazon's EC2 commandline tools written in Java? You'd know what I mean).<p>Of course it could be solved by some kind of injecting of program to be run to some VM already running, but that's not an established practice of working with basic programs in your system. At some level fast binaries are needed.<p>Personally I think it's a pity that some language of SML family didn't get to the mainsteam for such system programming. Haskell is fun and people write things like text editors and window managers in it; but is still perceived as too academic for real tasks which isn't completely true.",1258212736

The inability of greek governments to adapt is in part responsible for this mess. It is also true, though, that most greeks (e.g. me) <i>did not</i> realize in what great peril the country was. Had we known the country was drowning in debt, we would not borrow as much and start businesses here. Unfortunately, even today, nobody has gone on trial over these grave financial crimes.<p>I might even argue it's also a cultural thing, in greece almost all laws are enforced loosely. Paying taxes is usually considered the dumb thing to do; you won't find many greeks being ""proud to pay their taxes"". Politics is impenetrable to new ideas, it's considered to be obscure like voodoo, passed on from generation to generation between 3 families (even now, the current  prime minister and the opposition leader used to be college roommates).<p>Not all greeks are the same though, you just hear the loudest voices. Greece has a large, educated (and largely unemployed) youth that could fuel a new wave of growth now that markets are opening here. You might hear of riots, but these were concentrated on a square in Athens. I might be wrong, but there is a growing feeling that we are expecting the impending default as a chance to start over the economy, to actually do some work.<p>Things are changing, in the eleventh hour, for sure, but one can only be optimistic.

From personal experience, configuring them is a pain in the backside if you're not an experienced sysadmin, which of course includes almost everyone. If that could be overcome, the tech is there.<p>As for hosting, there are various blog platforms where you have a choice between hosting the code yourself, either on your own machine or on a system included with your personal ISP account, or using a site such as wordpress.com where they do the maintenance and in some cases charge money for extras but the software and data formats are basically the same. I see no reason a similar model couldn't work for e-mail, and if a particular e-mail platform started to take off, there is no reason for ISPs not to support it locally; most of them have always offered some sort of included e-mail mailbox and webmail facility anyway, just not of the calibre of Google Mail and not necessarily easily compatible with other systems.<p>Basically, I think the problems with a better solution that doesn't leave you at the mercy of a big organisation like Google are genuine but not insurmountable.

It's partly based on Linux (the OS), but the stuff users see is largely written in Python. Squeak is on the laptop as one of the things students can use. I think the main reason it was put on there was for its eToys facility, which allows kids to draw objects on the screen and then program them to do things, to create their own simulations. It also has some games that run on it.<p>It's on there as part of the open source spirit of the system as well. Since Squeak reveals all of its code in Smalltalk, once they learn the language they can explore it and modify it however they like. The same goes for the Python stuff.<p>Re: Croquet<p>Yes, Croquet is written on the Squeak VM. It's actually based on a modification to Squeak, called ""Tweak"".<p>IMO Smalltalk is worth checking out. I've been doing so. There are different paths you could take with this. The basic level you can explore is the Smalltalk language itself. There are online books on the language you can read. There are some hardcopy books that cover the higher levels of Squeak. There's Morphic, which is the window manager for the Squeak desktop environment. There's eToys, which is a more abstract, but easy to use, scripting environment. Then there's Seaside, which is a web application framework for it. There are no books for this. The best source I've found for it are blogs that focus on Seaside.<p>Seaside uses some advanced programming constructs to create a programming environment that's unlike most other web frameworks out there. I haven't used it directly yet, but from what I've read about it, it's really nice. If you get into it you probably won't want to go back to what you used before.",1179312344

A textbook example of FUD [Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt]. <p><i>Here's the positive:</i> <p>The lame CIO's who believe the Microsoft FUD about linux and decide to go with Windows as their platform will inevitably have a brain-drain of their A-level coders. Once the A-level coders are gone, it's all down hill from there. Their code-base will turn into a Huge Ball of Mud, everything will slow to a crawl and their competitors will eat their lunch. Natural selection! Darwinism at work in the wilds of Corporate America!",1179311680

YC puts out a lot of free content and value into the community already. Unfortunately YC does not scale well. And why should it? It was created at the pleasure of the former Viaweb team and JL.<p>From my limited perspective, the following is what I see as something that may help counter the feeling of exclusion. <p>In the community of PG followers there seems to be a desire to 'belong' somehow more officially, if nothing more than to make conversations easier. News.YC I think helps quite a bit, but when guys in this niche community have to describe themselves it often comes out like this:<p>""I really like to read Paul Graham's articles and talk with other guys that like to read his articles.""<p>""I applied for YC and was rejected, but still like to associate with the other YC rejects.""<p>Both of those general statements just sound pretty lame when you try to tell your girlfriend (imaginary or real ;) about this little club of startup guys you're involved in.<p>Despite it being totally arbitrary other than to just make conversations easier and reduce exclusionary feelings, it might be useful if there were a more defined way to refer to this yc-affiliated-but-not-officially-part-of-community-of -like-minded-startup-guys.<p>Then those in the community could refer to their involvement in terms that doesn't sound like a fan club and isn't focused on a failed YC application.<p>Ideas?",1179310352

10330292,comment,10328015,10329774,0,0,patio11,,,"If I can rephrase this without it being a criticism: Go encourages particular patterns of use, much like any technology.<p>Rails, for example, strongly encourages programmers to keep a company&#x27;s entire operations in a single application and memory space.  Many Rails shops eventually discover that this is suboptimal for their needs, for example when one <i>particular</i> part of all of their operations need to be scaled up substantially but scaling a &quot;monorail&quot; requires memory proportionate to the <i>total size</i> of all operations times the highest desired throughput of <i>any</i> piece of the system.  I&#x27;m aware of several Rails shops which needed to retroactively decompose a monorail, and many of them rewrote the performance-intensive part in Go, as Go is bugs-in-your-teeth fast for many common workloads.<p>Just like Rails &quot;wants&quot; to be a monorail, Go feels to me like it wants to be a collection of small, X00 to ~2k line programs, talking to each other via JSON messages passed either over HTTP or a queueing system.  (Use NSQ!  It&#x27;s fantastic!)<p>Partly this is due to affordances in Go&#x27;s design for e.g. deploying systems.  If you want to re-deploy, just compile (for free) and copy the binary everywhere.  Partly it is due to Golang not yet having much in the way of community norms for building really big systems.  Dependency management is a very unsolved problem and gets worse the larger the individual pieces of your system get.  Golang also isn&#x27;t very opinionated about project structure in the way Rails is, which counsels keeping parts of your system bite-sized as a way of imposing structure on top of it.  (By comparison, you can drop any intermediate Rails programmer into virtually any Rails program and say &quot;Find the login page.  Find the $FOO business logic.&quot; and they&#x27;ll be able to do it in a few seconds.)",1444028374

10330289,comment,10327485,10329078,0,0,i336_,,,"That makes perfect sense, and I don&#x27;t argue with this logic at all. But since you&#x27;re here, I&#x27;d like to say something (that isn&#x27;t horrible :P) that I&#x27;ve actually wanted to [have the opportunity to] get out there about GCP for a while now.<p>The &quot;Heroku-style free&quot; tier is likely to be all I can manage for the short to medium term future, due to a variety of factors.<p>As a result, the two go-to systems I would turn to if I need code hosting are Heroku and OpenShift, and I have accounts with these platforms (although I&#x27;m leaning toward the latter lately). I am yet to do anything generally interesting with them myself, but these are the systems I take into account when talking to others, because I have no experience with GCP. (I wonder if this is true for others too, and how big that number is.)<p>I have zero idea how Heroku are fending off precisely what you refer to. I&#x27;ve heard about situations where individuals&#x27; AWS accounts have been hacked by automated systems that spin up &quot;instances with everything&quot;, but once it was established with billing that the account was hacked, the charges (which in one case were 5 figures) were fully reversed. Perhaps this fact is relevant here.<p>I think the problem can be solved before it (theoretically) gets to that point, however.<p>Serving up webpages, doing the occasional database transaction, etc, produces a significantly different CPU load than bitcoin mining does. I don&#x27;t consider instance CPU usage monitoring a violation of my privacy, so I think it would be perfectly fair to throttle back continuous high CPU usage, but allow for short bursts of high usage. (In fact, I think this kind of thing is already standard...?) For bonus points, make the system track instance CPU usage and adjust its thresholds to allow for periodic high burst usage :P (since, thinking about it, masquerading as a web server and doing 30 seconds of mining every 5 hours is going to work out to zero gain).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t consider it at all unfair to offer a free tier with exceptionally aggressive CPU-time QoS; in fact, it would probably suit me (and a lot of other people) perfectly, giving the funemployed community the option to do things like spin up fascinating new environments like Erlang, Dart, Rust, etc, and play with these environments (which are not yet available on Google&#x27;s cloud hosting infrastructure) for web serving and similar. (For <i>more</i> bonus points, I&#x27;d extend the heuristic CPU-time tracking I mentioned before to classify instances as &quot;friendly&quot; over the long term, and let them have exceptionally low latency! :D)<p>In short, there&#x27;s a whole demographic of people out there that you&#x27;re definitely excluding, including people like myself who are just at the &quot;messing around&quot; stage, to nervous types who don&#x27;t like deadlines and run from the &quot;free for X period of time&quot; part of GCP.<p>I realize and recognize that your response here is only your opinion, not Google&#x27;s, and I&#x27;m very happy to respond here or via email (my address is in my profile) if you&#x27;d like to discuss any of any of the things I&#x27;ve said. ^^",1444028264

Here&#x27;s more info.[1] The People&#x27;s Bank of China already has a more traditional credit rating system.  But most people in China don&#x27;t have a credit rating in any form.[2]  This seems to be a scheme to get the rest of the population plugged into the system. There&#x27;s a Government policy document on this &quot;social credit system&quot;.[3]  The Alibaba thing appears to be a trial under that system.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s a Government control thing, too. But China already had that - it&#x27;s called a dangan.  In China, many people really did have a Permanent Record. That&#x27;s not as important as it used to be, because it was employer-maintained, mostly by state employers.  With more private employers, it&#x27;s less of an issue. This new system may become a modernized version of the dangan.<p>China has a centuries-long history of keeping records on everyone. The old systems worked when there was very limited population mobility and job mobility.  Now, with a more flexible workforce, the old system is getting an upgrade.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chinadailyasia.com/business/2015-06/09/content_15274221.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinadailyasia.com/business/2015-06/09/content_15...</a>

Plus, breaking it into many small parts of known trajectory, with a very small standard deviation in size, is going to be a much more difficult problem than nudging one big part. Once the no-doubt irregularly-shaped chunks start interacting and banging into each other, all bets about impact sites are going to be off. You&#x27;d much rather miss the planet entirely instead of running the risk of a larger-than-average chunk hitting New York or Beijing.<p>On top of that, nudging it out of a collision trajectory is going to require a lot less energy than disintegrating it, particularly if you can arrange to do the nudge a long way off.

He had a look at Genome Wide Association studies, where you sequence a number of people with an illness and without the illness, and try to find genes that correlate with having the illness. The problem with these studies, he told us, was that quite often the number of genes they find correlating with having the illness is about the same order of magnitude as the number of participants in the study. But because many biologists are not so proficient at statistics, they don&#x27;t see that this smells of overfitting their model to the data. He took a particularly popular such study and applied a standard technique to detect overfitting, cross validation, and indeed found that the correlation they reported was spurious.<p>If I remember correctly, even after he destroyed the study, people kept citing it...",1444027864

The current justice system focuses too heavily on after-the-fact heavy-hitting crimes -- where an individual is harmed a great deal in a short period of time. But what about all the micro-crimes that many people commit over and over, hundreds or more times over the years? The justice system is, for the most part, completely oblivious in this respect. After all, how can you try a person for micro-crimes?<p>If instead, there were some God-like technology that watched for micro-crimes and compensated the victims in micro-payments (or something to that effect), it could really help to make reality more fair and just. Naturally the micro-payments would be funded by the perpetrators.<p>On another note, many mass murders are committed by people who have been essentially outcast from society in one way or another. If these people had someone to talk to about their problems or perceived social issues (real or otherwise), it could probably do some real good. An intelligent AI could serve this role. In fact, good AI friends might be sufficient alone to prevent many such murders.<p>Now, this is not to say that such a technology is anywhere near possible at this point in time. Nevertheless, I feel it is callous and completely inappropriate to look at things like mass murder without considering the sociological circumstances that lead to such events. The same type of thinking that makes people disregard murderers as non-humans is exactly the type of thinking that can lead someone to murder. There is a fine line to hypocrisy here.",1444027604

Sometimes I even learn from my interlocutors.<p>But <i>cryptofascist</i>?! Honestly ?<p>I mean this is HN.  You are supposed to play the ball, not the man, and certainly not call the ball a cryptofascist ball.<p>Do you do this to people in real life?

Did it come with the word &quot;Man!&quot; as well.<p>Really, stop it.<p>I should probably comment on the rest of your points, but it&#x27;s hard to get over the first point.  :-)<p>Edit: so, actually trying to respond.<p>It seems you say that open source software will align incentives, in a similar manner to (openish) standards of wrenches and parts.<p>I am a big supporter (can&#x27;t spell proponent) of OSS in place of black box solutions - it opens up an enormous range of positive solutions.  However OSS does not produce or guarantee standards.  And standards are the issue I see here.<p>The ability to freely inspect is vital to produce a market of reliable products.  It however is not sufficient - open inspection, agreed tests and measurements, and enforcement, are just parts of that.<p>Fake spare motor parts (OK, spare parts not meeting standards and with no accountability) should be prevented from entering the market - they increase the risk of failure, and even if it is possible to inspect the goods to determine their suitability, why should we impose that cost on every market participant? We have standards and enforcement to avoid such a problem - it could be seen as nanny state keeping people safe, or it could be seen as encouraging markets.<p>The method of ensuring markets are not polluted to the point of market failure will vary - most people relying on licensing and enforcement. It usually works.<p>I am arguing that someone who wants to inspect and play and learn about their car software should be allowed to just as they should be allowed to strip and clean an engine.<p>But even the cursory annual inspections (MA I assume is similar to UK&#x27;s MOT) are supposed to catch below standard modifications.  Even when I was younger, engines were too complex to be learnt, Father to Son, without a Hayes manual.<p>These days I am sure it is possible for a motivated, intelligent person to become sufficiently skilled that they could modify a modern engine, but I doubt they could do that <i>and</i> learn how to spot fake medication, determine if an aircraft jet engine was properly serviced and if their office block is using the correct steel joists.<p>The world is way to complex for us to trust God and test the rest.  We have to trust that there are sufficient standards and enforcements in place that we can rely on goods and services - otherwise we see market failure.<p>And finally in my rambling, I do not see it sufficent that if someone has modified their car, their own self preservation instinct will prevent them driving it if it could kill us both.  That&#x27;s never going to fly.<p>We need standards, inspection, accountability to ensure we defeat market failure.<p>We want to move beyond markets that deal in goods or services that cannot be trivially inspected by each participant.<p>Ps

Just curious what'll pop up.<p>It'll all be contained here too so as not to bug the other submissions, and you'll only come here if you expect something controversial.",1208858283

He's not claiming to be more experienced/well known than you; he is claiming that you are not a well known UK VC.",1208857694

But through it all, when there was doubt, /
I ate it up, and spit it out. /
I faced it all /
And I stood tall /
And did it my way. /
...
For what is a man, what has he got /
If not himself, then he has naught /
To say the things he truly feels /
And not the words of one who kneels. /
The record shows /
I took the blows /
And did it myyyyyyy way""</i><p>When things are going not so well, Leonard Cohen:<p><i>""I said to myself, 'Where are you golden boy, where's your famous golden touch?' /
I thought you knew where all of the elephants lie down. /

170443,comment,170246,170246,0,0,Tichy,,,"Might be a nice idea, but somehow I am glad that Germany (where I live) wasn't rebuild in that way after WW 2. That also makes me question the project a bit: is the problem really that ordinary houses are too hard to build in the respective regions, or are there other problems that prevent people from getting the act together? I suspect the latter.",1208857196

170441,comment,169921,169935,0,0,agentbleu,,,"I would argue that the law is ill equipped (or not the best place) to hammer out the rights and wrongs of emerging technologies that clearly will not go away. The only way forward for the labels is to embrace these 'upstarts' and work with all of them for a few years in profit sharing deals (reasonable ones not like the Imeem deal) and with a little lateral thinking imagine the profits to be made in a world full of content on demand (films included). But due to the nature of the beast, costs must come down 'right down' before they will go back up (legally).<p>BTW I think GS is ultra slick..<p>Good luck guys",1208856343

So I don't know that it will make people work for me, and hence I don't appreciate the sign-up form. If you require the sign-up before I can do anything meaningful, please show me what to expect in some other way (like a movie).<p>If I am not allowed to do something, don't show me the option to do it- please!",1208856338

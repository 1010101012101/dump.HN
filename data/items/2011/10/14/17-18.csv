I just tried a simple search for 'pthread_t' on both Koders (<a href=""http://www.koders.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.koders.com</a>) and Krugle (<a href=""http://opensearch.krugle.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensearch.krugle.org</a>). Both are mentioned elsewhere in the comments as possible alternatives.<p>Krugle found no results. Koders found results, but the response time was very large.<p>Both have a long way to go in being a viable Code Search replacement.<p>Hopefully Code Search just gets rolled into the primary Google search product.<p>NOTE:<p>I was just looking over the Koders results. It is tokenizing 'pthread_t' as 'pthread' 't', so the top results are not what I would consider useful. I'm sure I can change some settings to get proper tokenization for my languages identifiers, but that is more work up front.",1318615167

The thread I was in was concerned with how when Apple makes big changes, they are called bold, while when Microsoft does it, they are called flailing.<p>My point was that the comparison must take into account the culture each company takes toward accommodating the needs and tastes of legacy/long-standing customers. Pulling out one example - the Ribbon in Office, which people still bitch about to this day, mind you - does very little to argue that Microsoft has a tradition of bold changes breaking existing user expectations.

3112125,comment,3111888,3111888,6,0,eatporktoo,,,"As a person who recently switched from Android to a Windows Phone, I believe they can. The platform itself is fantastic. Once people start using the OS they fall in love with it. The problem is that most people don't even know that the OS exists. Most people I talk to think that it's Windows Mobile and that's very difficult to get the past. Now that I have had this phone for over a month, I must admit that I am not sure I could go back to Android. Android seems to be missing a certain polish that WP7 and iOS have. It also doesn't help that from a design perspective Android doesn't seem to have an identity. Many Android phone interfaces look and act differently. As a programmer this can be a nightmare but more so as a consumer I can't just tell someone to buy an Android phone. I have to qualify it with a specific model since they are all so different. Windows Phone almost has the opposite problem since there is so little variance in design from one phone to the next, but I appreciate that. It's like the way I wish PCs were shipped - without all of that OEM garbage that can make a fast computer as slow as a netbook out of the box.",1318614230

A few people manage it, but most build up those networks over a period of years.<p>Another thing, which I didn't realize when I was 20, is that if you make contacts with a lot of 20-year-olds, when they're 30 or 40, some of them will be in a much better position to partner with you than when they were 20.  The guy who was working as a manual software tester for a telecom firm at 20 may be the CTO of a startup at 30; the guy who's struggling through his CS degree at 20 may be managing a project at Oracle at 30.  But he has a lot more time to get to know you when he's working at the telecom firm or struggling through CS.  So even if you're a world-class connector like David Weekly or Adam Rifkin, with a Rolodex full of 1500 contacts at age 20, those contacts will be a lot more valuable for business when you're 30.",1318612903

3111994,comment,3111210,3111210,1,0,olsonjeffery,,,"Also mentioned in the article is a prototype for a browser-based version of LibreOffice (there's a link to a .webm demo video).<p>What's interesting about this, from what I've gathered, is the technology: recently released in GTK+ 3.2, is the Broadway system (not much in the way of docs on the net, sadly). It appears to amount to a new backend for GTK+ to draw to (other, more well known backends include X11 and Wayland). In this case, the Broadway system exposes a web server that a browser can load to ""access"" the app that is exposed. Drawing, in the browser, happens via canvas + web-sockets.<p>So, this brings up the question: What's their (LibreOffice's) story for this, if they try to take the product live? It seems like it'd amount to a massive, web-scale vm/server farm to run client instances. In the form presented in the article, this is more like a Citrix deployment than an actual webapp. Whether one prefers one or the other is a matter of personal taste, I suppose (I think there's something to like in the somewhat spartan experience of Google Docs vs. MS Word or LibreOffice Writer).",1318612346

Those things are definitely in the pipeline.<p>About clicking out of the textbox to save an item, I actually had it like that, but I found that if I wanted to edit a long item and switch away to a different tab to refer to something and come back, it would have automatically saved it, and I would have to edit it again. So I consciously chose to have the current behavior (note that you can press Shift + Enter to save changes). But if enough people suggest to change it back, I will.<p>I'm not sure I understand what the little bug you're referring to is. Do you mind posting a screenshot?<p>Thanks for the encouragement :)",1318611625

That's a report to show you what URLs Google tried to crawl but couldn't (due to being blocked) so you can review it and ensure that you are not accidentally blocking URLs that you want to have indexed.<p>I agree that it's confusing in that the report is in the ""crawl errors"" section.<p>(I built Google webmaster tools so this confusion is entirely my fault; but I don't work at Google anymore so sadly I can't fix this.)",1318611622

If you try to just translate raw mouse events into it you end up with lots of bugs related to the cursor reaching edges of the rendered area, browser window, or desktop in general.<p>The ideal solution in my opinion is to just offer mouse capturing as a user-enabled permission on page load from a domain (kind of how geolocation works now). The user would see a bar near the top of the browser asking if they want to give control of their mouse to the website, with the option to always break-out of that control with some key (such as ESC).",1318611620

6269425,comment,6267439,6268125,1,0,graue,,,"Thanks; great response. I had forgotten about crossovers.<p>I did a little project in CLJS and found the additional power of the language nice, but not revolutionary. I&#x27;ve found getting into Node.js that despite the well-known warts of JavaScript, the community has done an amazing job working around those problems, building powerful abstractions, and shipping simple, un-complected code. I hardly feel like I&#x27;m compromising on expressivity.<p>So for me, language like &quot;callback hell&quot; and &quot;wasteful&quot; rings a bit hollow, as it doesn&#x27;t reflect my experience writing JavaScript. In fact, if I were a contributor to When.js I could imagine it being pretty insulting.<p>Maybe we can win more people to ClojureScript by recognizing, not diminishing, the great stuff folks have made with vanilla JS, and showing how CLJS provides interop while making JavaScript programming even better. Kevin Lynagh&#x27;s post here[1] is a nice example of that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://keminglabs.com/blog/angular-cljs-weather-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keminglabs.com/blog/angular-cljs-weather-app/</a><p>As for my &quot;glass is half-empty&quot; interpretation of code-sharing, I&#x27;m thinking of how you can trivially require jQuery from a Node.js application and use it for scraping[2]. Or how you can require(&#x27;http&#x27;) in the browser and effortlessly make HTTP requests in browser or server with the same code[3]. I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong, but ClojureScript seems far away from this kind of stuff. You can&#x27;t use Compojure or HTTP-Kit in ClojureScript. So you could say that while Clojure has a <i>decent</i> client/server code-sharing story, there&#x27;s this other thing, JavaScript, that has an <i>amazing</i> one.<p>[2] <a href=""http://blog.nodejitsu.com/jsdom-jquery-in-5-lines-on-nodejs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.nodejitsu.com/jsdom-jquery-in-5-lines-on-nodejs</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/substack/http-browserify"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/substack/http-browserify</a>",1377370421

Not in a pleasant way, most often there are drugs, own made up rules, human trafficking going on and so on, living condition are probably terrible (slums). But it is just the whole setup is interesting. Like a little fiefdom or small city state.<p>Authorities are either corrupt and are bought off and discouraged from going in there via positive reinforcement or they are just so outnumbered and the determination of the community to keep them out will make it very hard to get to a particular subject to arrest them.<p>I can think of Brazilian favelas or that one criminal in Jamaica that was walled off and protected by a large community who he was &quot;taking care of&quot;. It is also interesting at how self sufficient those places are. Is there always rampant disease and crime or is there a support network, people helping each other in need and so on.

6269397,comment,6268480,6268848,5,0,Millennium,,,"Agreed. Incremental backoff makes sense for the 5xx-class errors, where the error is known to be server-side. But 404 is the only 4xx-class error that it makes any sense for: in any other case, it&#x27;s pretty certain that your side is doing something wrong. Even when you&#x27;re not -i.e. if you&#x27;re absolutely certain that this is the right URL for what you want- a 404 should still trigger some kind of notification so that a person can look into it.<p>Using incremental backoff for 410, in particular, is to miss the point entirely. 410 very explicitly means that you should not try again. The fact that it&#x27;s so rare only lowers the chance that it&#x27;s being used incorrectly: someone savvy enough to set up a 410 knows enough to mean it.<p>That said, I&#x27;m starting to think that if you&#x27;re going to implement 410 on your site, you should also start logging activity. When a host keeps looking, either incrementally or otherwise, start refusing connections from that host at the firewall level. A program that sets 4xx-class errors to fail silently probably isn&#x27;t doing anything about refused connections, so an IP-ban should wake the developers up. Even if it doesn&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t have erroneous requests clogging your server logs, so you still benefit.",1377369829

However, it&#x27;s a sexually charged event and everyone who goes to the event knows this before they go and the event occurs far far away from the normal world. To be out there charging people for acts that are within the social norms of the event, especially in a way that is going to follow them back to their life where ever they happen to live is pretty shitty.<p>TBH I don&#x27;t get why public urination deserves more than a ticket as deterrence.

That makes you a hypocrite.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else you expect other than blind cynicism - the NSA constantly does pedantic backflips, lies or invokes &quot;national security&quot; to prevent from telling anyone what they&#x27;re doing, even when it&#x27;s clear they&#x27;re violating any sensible ethical guideline. What should we talk about, and what&#x27;s wrong with speculation?<p>Also, the idea that we need to &quot;see the good&quot; in the NSA is fallacious. The NSA is a party made of volunteers who work for a government who have chosen to not only exercise authority authority over me, but to abuse it gratuitously, all while the tax dollars of myself and others fund them to do so, when most of us never asked them to. Under what moral philosophy do I have to live to ignore that context to have a peaceful discussion about the merits of a completely-broken system? On a personal note, foreign intelligence is great, which the NSA has clearly not limited themselves to in any capacity, based on the information that we actually do have.<p>If there&#x27;s a direction the discussion should move in, perhaps you could start by leading that discussion, instead of sitting on the sidelines and complaining about other people and trying to control their thoughts and minds. As I&#x27;m sure you know, actions, intuition and insight are better teachers than whining and exercising authority.<p>I do agree that more critical thought (and less blind cynicism) is a good thing.<p>Finally, I can&#x27;t help but note that your role reversal of the <i>1984</i> example is an extremely-ironic case of &quot;Doublethink&quot;, since under no circumstance are the masses hating on the government blindly remotely applicable to the novel.",1377367241

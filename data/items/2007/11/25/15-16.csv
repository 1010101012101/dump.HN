We should all have pretty thick skin here.<p>My only regret: I took a 5 minute break and posted a top 10 list for a few chuckles.  I ended up spending 2 hours here and didn't finish my day's work until after midnight.  Pretty soon I may need a 12 Step program for news.ycombinator.com.",1196005410
83322,comment,83196,83294,0,0,edw519,,,"Single entry/single exit refers to ANY process, not just functions.  Don't underestimate the hell who can go through with poor variable naming.  Case in point:<p>2 months ago, a client needed significant changes to a major process in their app.  (I had 2 weeks.)  This process was a BASIC subroutine called by 16 other processes.  Now get this: It was 2800 lines of code with one entry and 16 different exits.  It was written in 1991 and had been modified 68 times before I came along.  Here are a few of the variables: A, AA, AAA, AAAA, B, BB, BBB, BBBB, C, CC, CCC, CCCC, INFO, FORM1, FORM2, FORM3, HOLD.FORM2, OLD.FORM2, ORIG.FORM2, STUFF, DUMMY1, DUMMY2, DUMMY3...  You get the idea.  I spent 4 days renaming variables before I could start refactoring.  There were some variables I never did figure out.  I rewrote the program (550 lines) and hit the deadline.  I uncovered over 20 undocumented bugs.  I wonder what it will look like 5 years from now.<p>Everything I write new is either Javascript or PHP.  Now that my startup is ramping up, soon I won't have to deal with any of this old stuff any more.<p>(Aside: I wonder how much production code in the world today is over 10 years old.  And how much has been modified over 10 times?)",1196005171

Nobody saw it coming, and even after it arrived lots of people doubted that it would sell. If the iPod hadn't been invented, it's possible that Business Week's analysis would have held up better -- the iPod drives a lot of shoppers into the Apple Stores.<p>All the doom-and-gloom comparisons to the Gateway Store look hilarious now. My understanding is that the Gateway Stores were not the problem; it was the Gateways that were the problem.",1196004523

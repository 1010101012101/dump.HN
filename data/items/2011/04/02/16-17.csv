2400329,comment,2399139,2399139,6,0,dgallagher,,,"I made a similar mistake myself, forming an LLC in Massachusetts. I did IT consulting for the SoHo and home market. It was around $550/year to keep the LLC in business ($500 plus filing fees), ~$50 to register with the town you're based for four years, and something like $250 to dissolve the LLC with the state. Every state has different fees; some are quite high, and others very low, pending on the type of business created.<p>I did it mainly to limit liability, among other reasons. However a little while after forming, I spoke to a lawyer and he said that it basically doesn't limit you from being sued personally. You ""can"" attempt to deflect personal lawsuits with the LCC (easiest if you keep its finances/files/bank-account separated from your personal stuff, which I did), but it's no guarantee.<p>He basically advised me that forming the LLC was a waist of money in my situation, and I would have been better off simply as a sole-proprietor (e.g. DBA - doing-business-as). From the IRS's perspective, I was treated as a sole-proprietor for tax purposes (they don't recognize LLC's for single individuals). Of course by then, it was too late to easily dissolve the LLC and ""switch"" it to a DBA, so it was money wasted.<p>What annoyed me the most is the same problem Hamza had in the article. You have to pay money to dissolve a business! Really? REALLY?!? Obviously the business failed, or is being abandoned, because it didn't make enough money. Charging a ""death tax"" on a business seems pretty harsh. I understand if there's a filing fee of $20 or $30, but anything higher than that is ridiculous. Delaware wanting $1,600 from Hamza is downright insane. Perhaps there's more work involved dissolving a C-Corp than an LLC, but still, $1,600 is ridiculous.<p>Charging a business death-tax reduces seed capital needed to form a new business. Second, it reflects badly on the state, reducing the likelihood of incorporating in it again. Lastly, why not ignore paying the fee altogether, declare bankruptcy, and waste the time/money of the court system dealing with it all? I'm not sure about the legal implementations of that, but it might be a valid option if the C-Corp has no assets left. AFAIK you cannot ask shareholders to pay for it since they're legally shielded from the debts of a C-Corp.",1301763437

2400310,comment,2399961,2400083,31,0,jerf,,,"Part of the problem is that the American distrust of intellectualism is itself not the irrational thing that those sympathetic to intellectuals would like to think. Intellectuals killed by the millions in the 20th century, and it actually takes the sophisticated training of ""education"" to work yourself up into a state where you refuse to count that in the books. Intellectuals routinely declared things that aren't true; catastrophically wrong predictions about the economy, catastrophically wrong pronouncements about foreign policy, and just generally numerous times where they've been wrong. Again, it takes a lot of training to <i>ignore</i> this fact. ""Scientists"" collectively were witnessed by the public flipflopping at a relatively high frequency on numerous topics; how many times did eggs go back and forth between being deadly and beneficial? Sure the media gets some blame here but the scientists played into it, each time confidently pronouncing that this time they had it for sure and it is imperative that everyone live the way they are saying (until tomorrow). Scientists have failed to resist politicization across the board, and the standards of what constitutes science continues to shift from a living, vibrant, thoughtful understanding of the purposes and ways of science to a scelerotic hide-bound form-over-substance version of science where papers are too often written to either explicitly attract grants or to confirm someone's political beliefs... and regardless of whether this is 2% or 80% of the papers written today it's nearly 100% of the papers that people hear about.<p>I simplify for rhetorical effect; my point is not that this is a literal description of the current state of the world but that it is <i>far more true</i> than it should be. Any accounting of ""anti-intellectualism"" that fails to take this into account and lays all the blame on ""Americans"" is too incomplete to formulate an action plan that will have any chance of success. It's not a one-sided problem.<p>If you want to fix anti-intellectualism, you first need to fix intellectualism and return it to its roots of dispassionate exploration, commitment to truth over all else and bending processes to find truth rather than bending truth to fit (politicized) processes, and return to great, foundational humility that even the press could not overplay into hubris. And they need to drop their blinders whereby they excuse away the damage that intellectuals have done while ignoring these ancient precepts and only crediting themselves their successes, because it cuts themselves off from the very object lessons that could help them return to this time-tested approach to science, which they still flatter themselves that they follow. If you fail to fix the intellectuals first, then all your effort to fix ""Americans"" is going to fail; you'll bend your efforts towards getting them to look at intellectuals seriously, but they'll end up coming to the same conclusions they already have about the value of intellectuals and you'll have wasted your shot.<p>I'm not holding my breath.",1301763114

Basically, if you have the chops to get a job in science, you're probably better off doing something else (like med school; lots of people want to be doctors).<p>Consider that firefighters or cops get paid reasonably well; effectively can't be fired after a short probationary period unless they do something incredibly egregious because they're protected by unions; have jobs that demand physical activity, so they aren't just sitting in front of a screen all day; and, in the case of firefighters, have a level of social prestige that means (male) firefighters are almost universally admired by women.<p>Wanting to be a cop or firefighter requires a two-year degree, if that.

There was a time several decades ago when the Christian proletariat majority widely supported science, read popular periodicals about science, and aspired to educate their children in science and engineering. There was also a time when conservatives were far more pro-science than liberals. This is why it's important to know some of the history here. Today's anti-science sentiment is surely rooted in right wing Christian factions, and that needs to be fought. But there's <i>absolutely</i> no reason to think that conservative Christians can't endorse and value science, since they have in the past.<p>The acknowledgement of past conservative/religious alignment with science comes from Jacoby. Decrying the current state is not the same as a summary dismissal.<p>Mooney and Kirschenbaum are what the ""New Atheists"" call accommodationists.

I think the digital world provides so much opportunity to create original content, that we no more need copies.

The cost of acquisition will generally rise as the cost of your service goes up, and that is expected.

(Using JRuby gives you other benefits as well, such as speed and connection pooling, plus the use of every Java library.)<p>""Is it easier to find ruby people or pythoners?""<p>I've had trouble finding Ruby devs.  And while I've never tried to find a Python developer I get the impression there are fewer Python devs in my area (Phoenix, AZ, USA) than Rubyists.   When I talked to some people about trouble finding devs I was told  it's a similar problem looking for Java or C# or PHP people.<p>#ruby-lang on freenode is a great place to get help. #rails, maybe not so much, though I'm basing that more on hearsay and comments from people I know.  OTOH, #ramaze rocks, and would be my first choice for any new Web app. Less ceremony, full-featured, great + friendly community.<p>Bottom line, though, is that you should spend some time with each language, look at a few Web frameworks, and pick what makes you feel most comfortable.",1301760891

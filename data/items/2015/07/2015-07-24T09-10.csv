9940955,comment,9940934,9940934,0,0,sytelus,,,"This is perhaps the most enlightening article that I have read so far. It does explain current dynamics in real estate market where prices are getting red hot because inventory is at historic low levels (because new constructions have slowed dramatically since 2008). Meanwhile population in the urban areas had been continue to grow putting pressure on rents and house prices. It&#x27;s simple delayed feedback loop system that explains lot of things and data from past boom and current state fits pretty well with this theory.<p>The big question is how long this cycle will last. The 18 years mentioned in article seems too high. Currently construction activities are 1/3 of the size than boom period and I would estimate it catches up in 2-3 years. Then hyper supply period should start which should last again 2-3 years. So 4-6 seems like target for recession phase and 2-3 years before house prices starts becoming declining.",1437731680

I think tail call conversion to iteration for Java bytecode could be added to a JVM implementation without changing the spec, and you could also do it when converting F# to bytecode.  Apparently it&#x27;s on the todo list but not high priority.<p>Stack allocation is trickier if it&#x27;s specified in F# code, because it isn&#x27;t part of the VM spec, but automatic stack allocation for Java has been demonstrated in a research context and I think either HotSpot or J9 can do it too.<p>The method size limit is something like 2^16 bytecodes, but even if that&#x27;s a problem, JITs are free to inline beyond that as much as they want.<p>So, I agree it would take some work but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fundamentally impractical.

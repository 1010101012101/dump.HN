291041,comment,290746,290746,0,0,pmjordan,,,"There are some very valid points in there; the inability to perform a successful build locally has caught me on a couple of projects. Unfortunately, as the number of dependencies increases, this inevitably becomes more difficult. If the project depends on more than 2-3 libraries, I think it's reasonable to include the more obscure (obscure = isn't supplied with the top 5 Linux distros & OSX; slow release cycle) in the source code repository, and maybe supply the more mainstream ones in one ready-to-use .zip for those poor Windows folk.<p>The lack of infrastructure (version control, bug tracking, mailing lists) around open source projects is a real issue as well, and one for which there are no excuses, as sourceforge etc. will supply you with said infrastructure for free. (in money <i>and</i> time) It can seem somewhat silly when it's literally just one guy churning out the odd release, but I think it's appropriate even then.<p>The main barrier to entry I've encountered is just reading my way through the code so I understand it well enough to be confident enough to change anything. Yeah, documentation would be nice, but let's face it, it's never going to happen.<p>I've found the best way to get started is to reserve a free weekend...",1220129453

291037,comment,290342,290587,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Engineers do not make $150K a year at a startup. If you happen to run across this rare event, take the job, live on $40K and bank the rest (i.e. don't buy a BMW). Then, 6-18 months later when the company goes down in flames, you will have more than enough money to start your own company.<p>If you aren't a founder, the best job to get at a startup is some sort of ""VP"" role after the series A round. These guys DO get paid $150-$175K a year, get the same number of options as the early stage engineers, and don't have to do as much work. As far as I can tell, their only role is to go to meetings with each other.  That said, the mere existence of these employees signals almost certain doom for the startup.<p>My apologies to the YC founders looking for employees, but being an early stage engineer (not a founder) at a startup is for suckers. You get paid paid $10-$50K less than you could at a big company, and your  options are going to be worthless or worth far less than you could ever imagine. If you have an entrepreneurial bent, your best bet is to take the higher salary somewhere else and save money until you start your own thing.",1220128802

291029,comment,289487,289774,0,0,timr,,,"That's just begging the question -- if your income is in the top 1% of all earners, and you still <i>""have to work for a living""</i>, then you're pretty clearly not living within your means.<p>It's quite obvious that the definition of the word ""rich"" is relative, and subjectively defined.  Yet everyone seems to focus on that relativity as if it's some huge, meaningful insight.  It isn't.  At the end of the day, if you're earning more than 99% of everyone around you, and you <i>still</i> can't pay your bills?  That means that you're doing it wrong.",1220127198

291023,comment,289487,290741,0,0,sah,,,"Sure, whether you need to work to earn a living depends on the standard of living and risk level you're comfortable with.  But I think it's possible to set a reasonable upper bound.  Say, around the point where your interest income at a typical risk-free rate, after reinvestment to keep pace with inflation, would put you among the highest earners in the world if it were ordinary income.  Defining ""highest earners"" as those in the top two US tax brackets, that amount is currently around $8-10M, or on the order of 2^23 present-day dollars.<p>Personally I think on the order of 2^22 dollars reasonably qualifies as well.  Maybe that's because of the standard of living I'm used to.  Certainly if you have 2^24 dollars and you don't think you're rich, you have a definition of wealth that ignores a major qualitative difference in what a person can afford to do.  Above 2^23 dollars, I think additional wealth begins to put you more in the realm of the low-level aristocracy and rulers than the merely rich.",1220126417

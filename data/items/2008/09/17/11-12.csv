These ""bankers"" won't be running hacker startups and the main reason is not their lack of technical ability but rather the ""cultural"" attitude in many of them that doing anything else (besides working in big finance) is a failure and a proof they are not that smart.<p>Of course, there is always room for a few exceptions.",1221652069

AIG lends to people at around LIBOR + 4% for mortgages or LIBOR + a lower % to insure BBB to AA rated borrowers.<p>They'll probably have to sell off their assets in a hurry at below fair value.

If you have more than some 10-15 machines, you ought to automate the work of keeping them in sync. You want to minimize effort of administration.<p>; You install something along the lines of puppet from  <a href=""http://reductivelabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reductivelabs.com</a> and use that to manage your server infrastructure.<p>; You install a monitoring suite for the infrastructure. Ganglia is popular when the servers are forming a cluster.<p>With the above, any reasonable operating system will work, be it .deb/.rpm based linux distros, *BSD, or OSX (I honestly don't know how to do this properly in Windows).",1221650062

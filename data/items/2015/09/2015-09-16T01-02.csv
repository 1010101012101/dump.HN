Every app runs pretty smooth since there are so few models and screen sizes to accomodate and I never have to worry when I download from the app store, at all!

But when I was in middle school on my pops pre G3 apple computer (or maybe it was the G3 at that point I&#x27;m not sure) I pretty easily figured out how to use a text editor and a preinstalled language to solve project euler problems.

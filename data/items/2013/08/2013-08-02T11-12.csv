I quit Design School (one of the best in my country) because I really hate how universities work over here, even though it was free [1]. I learn really quick most tasks but the way people are teaching here is slow and really &quot;opressive&quot;: you MUST attend to almost all classes otherwise you will automatically fail, you MUST learn stuff you won&#x27;t even use EVER [2] and so on.
Even though I think that, I&#x27;m still attached to learn with a mentor - not a TEACHER - because I think it&#x27;s the only way I can learn real world shit.
I really hope I can find something that pleases me now that my parents are kinda suffering a economic crisis.<p>1 - Federal or State Universes here in Brazil are free and most of them are called the best in the country, even though almost ALL lack something like good rooms and research equipment.
2 - There was a subject (I guess it&#x27;s the right word) we had to study called Technical Drawing. It was like AutoCAD with hands: we had to use different sizes of pencils to draw houses, yes houses. I talked to people that was almost in the end of the course and they said &quot;I&#x27;ve NEVER used this in my projects&quot;.",1375443749

You&#x27;re trying to solve the wrong problem...<p>You are not a procrastinator. You are a fish out of water. You are not where you belong, working on what you should be working on. You consciously don&#x27;t realize this, but deep down inside, you really do; that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re fighting yourself. That also pretty much explains all of your behavior.<p><i>However, I&#x27;m also pretty smart which helps me fake it so that no one else notices.</i><p>So what. Join the crowd<p><i>I think part of my problem might be that I grew up with an entitlement complex as I was valedictorian, near perfect SATs etc. and I never did shit in high school.</i><p>It&#x27;s about time that you stop diagnosing and analyzing yourself and start seeking what you love and where you belong.<p><i>Now that I&#x27;m in the real world it&#x27;s starting to really gnaw at me.</i><p>Funny how that works. Welcome.<p><i>I make $130k as a 21 year old</i><p>Forget about that. Some of the worst personal decisions ever made were over-influenced by money. Don&#x27;t fall into that trap. The next thing you know, you&#x27;ll be 55 years old, with what others would call a good life, and you&#x27;ll be wondering where the time went and why you didn&#x27;t live the life your really wanted. I know know tons of people just like that, who spent so much time chasing nickels, they never really lived their intended life. Don&#x27;t end up like them.<p><i>and I probably put in 3 hours of real work a day.</i><p>Then you&#x27;re probably in the wrong job.<p><i>I&#x27;m a good enough programmer that I can bullshit my way through most stuff</i><p>How sad. Find a better path.<p><i>at this point I think people are starting to realize that I&#x27;m a bit slower than I could be</i><p>The lack of congruence in your life will manifest itself in many ways. This is just one.<p><i>I still push out a lot of code, but I secretly spend 7-8 hours a day doing bullshit at work (reading online, games, etc).</i><p>Another signal that you&#x27;re in the wrong place. It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s your situation.<p><i>I know that I&#x27;ve been given a gift and that I&#x27;m a fucking idiot for wasting it</i><p>Knowing there&#x27;s a problem is good.<p><i>but I&#x27;ve just become a chronic procrastinator and it sucks.</i><p>Misidentifying the problem is not good.<p><i>I could be changing the world</i><p>You are changing the world. Just not in the way you imagined. Your post here is probably helping many others. And that&#x27;s just one thing.<p>We all change the world in our own small way. Learn to accept that&#x27;s OK.<p><i>I&#x27;m putting in the bare minimum and no matter what trick or method I try I can&#x27;t seem to beat it.</i><p>Because you&#x27;re addressing the wrong problem. See above.<p><i>I&#x27;ve never had a strong willpower to begin with and now it seems to be getting worse</i><p>Willpower&#x27;s got nothing to do with it. (Example: How much willpower does it take to not beat your children?) Just to the right thing. That doesn&#x27;t take willpower, just identifying the right thing and then doing it.<p><i>Any advice on how you taught yourself to focus on tasks, build willpower, and get shit done would be helpful.</i><p>Yea. Stop fighting &quot;it&quot; and find what you&#x27;d love to do. Then start doing it. You&#x27;ll be amazed that you ever even posted this here.<p><i>I wonder if I really fucked my brain/habits up so much that I&#x27;ll never reach my full capacity.</i><p>No. Unless you did lots of drugs or fell off you bike or something like that.<p><i>I&#x27;ve been like this for the past 6-7 years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away anytime soon.</i><p>Doesn&#x27;t matter...<p>2 people are going from New York to San Francisco. One has gone directly from New York to Chicago. The other has made stops in Florida, Texas, Virgina, and Oklahoma on his way to Chicago. How do their plans differ now that they are both in Chicago and need to get to San Francisco? They don&#x27;t. The past doesn&#x27;t matter. Only the present and the future. This applies to you too. Forget about the past 6-7 years and find your path.<p><i>My dad is also very similar in that he&#x27;s smart enough to bullshit through life but he only works at 10-20% of his full capacity and he never completes anything.</i><p>One at a time please.<p><i>Help!?</i><p>I hope I have.

Read the book, Max Brooks does it a lot better than I just did from a three year old memory.

I do like it in the sense that it was the only thing we had for the last 20 years, and I obviously support separating waste (be it at the consumer level or centralized) for environmental purposes, but it&#x27;s hard to tell what (in hindsight) was best: that we had separation at consumer for the last 20 years, but that we will have to live with a more inefficient system for the next decade(s); or that we would have postponed separate collection 20 years ago until let&#x27;s say 10 or 5 years ago, and started with the more efficient (centralized) separation system.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting question, and very difficult to answer. Like climate studies, you&#x27;d need to calculate so many side effects, that your answer might be different depending on the context you take into account. I&#x27;ve discussed this topic quite extensively with colleagues in urban planning and environmental sciences in countries across the world, but nobody knows (obviously) and people&#x27;s preferences tend to align with what they have or have worked on. Personally I tend towards the automated / technology solutions (i.e., centralized), but I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s because of a cognitive bias or from an increased ability in estimating these sort of things from experience, so that basically nullifies my opinion, too.<p>It&#x27;s water under the bridge anyway.",1375443017

The Government has not introduced any evidence to suggest that PFC Manning was not permitted to download the cables in question. The Government simply asserts that PFC Manning was not permitted to download them using a certain program, Wget. (Sec. 6)<p>The Government is simply incorrect in asserting that the use of an unauthorized program to download information automatically converts what would otherwise be authorized access to that information into exceeding authorized access.  Whether or not PFC Manning used Wget to download the information he had access to is irrelevant; under the language of Section 1030, as well as this Courts ruling and all legal authorities, PFC Manning could not have exceeded his authorized access because he was authorized to obtain the information he obtained. That is, exceeds authorized access is not concerned with the manner in which information to which one has access is downloaded; it is rather concerned with whether the accused was authorized to obtain or alter the information that was obtained or altered.

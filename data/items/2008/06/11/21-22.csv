All of them (well, Maroon is more recent) have been doing this for 4+ years, with several hundred to over 1,000 posts.  These heavy producers are responsible for a disproportionate amount of the good written content on the web. Sure, there are other sources of good (maybe even better) writing, (Moserware is a current favorite of mine) but they haven't been writing for long and don't write much so they get seen as often.  How many things on the top 30 are more than 2 days old?<p>This is just like saying ""I'm sick of hearing about all those startups in Silicon Valley - I only want to hear about startups from other places.""",1213221118

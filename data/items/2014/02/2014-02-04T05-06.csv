7175758,comment,7175285,7175285,2,0,Theodores,,,"This reminds me of election polls in the UK. Before an election some agency will phone up a thousand or so people and ask them what they plan to do on election day - tick the red box or the blue box. Sometimes they also go door to door or ask people in shopping centres. Despite their methods they do get to miss a lot of folk - those that do not have phones and those that are out working rather than waiting for the pollster to ring their doorbell. Consequently the results are not necessarily representative of true voter intentions.<p>As for the total XP installed count, what about all those machines that get used every day in some workplace for something as ordinary as printing labels but never get to go online? Or those rooms full of PCs that only get occasional use because people bring their own device or do their personal surfing on a phone? Or those PC&#x27;s in back rooms that generally collect dust? These machines are like the voters the pollsters miss.",1391493099

The normal way of entering the user name into one field and the password into another would continue to work. The site would simply check and if the user name field content is blank, and the password field content has a space in it, the password field content will be assumed to actually be the user name and password together, separated by a space.<p>The idea here is that you&#x27;d then be able to enter both the user name and the password with a single copy/paste operation. This would be convenient when using a password manager on an iPad. I sometimes get tired of having to do this:<p>1. unlock password manager<p>2. copy user name<p>3. switch to browser<p>4. paste user name<p>5. switch back to password manager<p>(If using most paranoid security settings, insert another step of &quot;unlock password manager&quot;)<p>6. copy password<p>7. switch to browser<p>8. paste password<p>If the website supported my single-field option, I could just set the password manager to stop the computer user name and password is the password field, and then it is only unlock/copy/switch/paste.",1391493076

I know you are just trying to give everyone google&#x27;s prespective, but you should reconsider. You raise the point that maybe there are legal issues, or trade laws etc that prevent google&#x27;s growth to other economic markets. Well there are workarounds, if google bothers looking for them.<p>For example, they find that the economic service they are using to pay devs, is not available in country X. they do a little research and find that skrill (formerly moneybookers) is available in country X, and it is also available in their country. They get in touch with skrill and work something out to be able to pay in country X. I cant imagine a law that says they cant contact services which are legally allowed to do transactions from your country to country X. Yes, i buy the reason that google itself may not be allowed, but it certainly can employ other services to do that for them. That&#x27;s what channels are for!<p>PS: having EU HQ in ireland and not being legally allowed to pay people in ireland? that makes zero sense",1391492984

Also probably patching the hole you used to get in so that nobody else can use it for their purposes.<p>Now this is highly high level and remote vulnerabilities like these are much rarer than browser vulnerabilities, but from what I&#x27;ve heard there are a number of these vulnerabilities floating around just waiting for microsoft to abandon support for xp.

7175749,comment,7174446,7174446,5,0,Cogito,,,"My favourite bit, which I had not seen before today, is on the &#x27;duck technique&#x27;. From Wikipedia:<p>The duck technique in corporate programming is an applied example of Parkinson&#x27;s law of triviality: a programmer expects their corporate office to insist on a change to something (anything at all) on every presentation to show that they&#x27;re participating, so a programmer adds an element they expect corporate to remove on purpose. Quoted from Jeff Atwood&#x27;s blog, Coding Horror:[1]<p><i>This started as a piece of corporate lore at Interplay Entertainment. It was well known that producers (a game industry position roughly equivalent to project manager) had to make a change to everything that was done. The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn&#x27;t, they weren&#x27;t adding value.<p>The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen&#x27;s animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the &quot;actual&quot; animation.<p>Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, &quot;That looks great. Just one thing: get rid of the duck.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jargon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jar...</a>",1391492952

A cursory search tells me SVO and SOV cover 75% of all languages. It would be interesting to see if people speaking SOV languages would prefer suffix notation. I would expect common patterns in (unrelated) world languages to loosely mirror natural dispositions towards syntax.

7175701,comment,7171549,7174890,3,0,Theodores,,,"We could take any period of history, find the suffering, focus on the untold human interest stories and look at just that, in isolation.<p>For instance, right now we have The War Against Terror. We could put together the stories of those murdered by drone strikes, waterboarded in Guantanamo, raped by soldiers and so on. Yet the canvas is far larger, there are the stories of the soldiers and the perplexing question as to why we all let it go on. Everyone paid their taxes to pay for the war machine and everyone voted for a politician that voted for The War Against Terror (or would have voted for it had they been elected). I know this because, in October 2001, those willing to protest against the war amounted to me and a very small handful of others. Clearly by 2003, and the invasion of Iraq, there were millions more wanting to protest against the conduct of the war, however, October 2001 is where the uncomfortable truth is. By merely focusing on the &#x27;human interest stories&#x27;, be it in New York or Afghanistan, we avoid this uncomfortable truth aspect of the bigger narrative.<p>Regarding Elizabeth Freeman, she did not make it to the courtroom on her own. Her male, white lawyer said a few words for her there. His story is interesting because he did own slaves and, once Elizabeth Freeman was free, she became his servant. So how free would she have been without his efforts and, as a servant, how free was she anyway?<p>As for being &#x27;fed and watered&#x27;, the thing about owning a slave is that a slave did have to be cared for to a certain extent rather than just worked to death. Meanwhile, an &#x27;indentured servant&#x27; could be worked to death&#x27; as there was no obligation or expectation to care for them into old age.<p>Regarding &#x27;routine sexual assaults&#x27;, I am sure that goes on and has gone on since the beginning of time, regardless of race. Women were property too up until recent times, passed on from father to husband, with surname changing according to ownership. Yet, I like to believe that my great-grand-fathers did more than see their other halves as property, there 24/7 for their sexual gratification.<p>Not everything need be painted as a wall of horror. Is everyone with some mixed-race ancestry the bastard spawn of some horrific rape? Or, amongst the tide of misery were there some instances where genuine love was able to flourish between Master and his concubine(s)? What about the white lady of the house and the gardener? Did love sometimes flourish there too? Again, the more in depth narrative fascinates whereas your &#x27;it was just beatings and rape&#x27; version of the story is a tad trite for me.<p>The danger of painting the story as &#x27;black and white&#x27; with whites evil and persons of colour whiter-than-white is that by understanding the story that way you may come into a situation where you insult someone from a different background to yourself by assuming too much about their heritage.",1391492043

However, I believe there&#x27;s a little more nuance to it than you realize.<p>Middle-class parents in a low crime neighborhood don&#x27;t really have to worry about young Sally growing up to be a psychotic warrior because they to occasionally watch blockbuster movies like 300 or Saving Private Ryan.<p>But if family movie night regularly included films like Eyes Wide Shut or Fifty Shades of Grey, one can certainly imagine it may influence a young adult&#x27;s sexuality. And at a time when they are exceptionally impressionable and have particularly poor judgement no less. This is an unsettling thought to most parents.<p>That said, I do believe that Americans generally overexpose their children to bombastic, violent movies. I&#x27;m certain that this has something to do with our relatively higher violent crime rates. I&#x27;m not sure if our media shapes our collective consciousness or the other way around.

While the difference is should not change the outcome, it would have put DO is a fairer position.<p>2. I dont think Linode has officially roll out their new Storage System yet which is SSD + HDD Based but not using SSD for cache. At first I was skeptic of why not solely using SSD instead. But the results speaks for themselves, although one should note this is still in beta and not being used in Production so performance could degrade once the mass majority are on it. Compare to DO which is a real world performance.<p>3. There are whole loads of other things Linode does better then DO. Linode has pooled bandwidth, which to this date DO still haven&#x27;t got round to implement. Different Linode are on different Hardware by default. Which DO is only just started doing it in a few cases.  Bandwidth and Latency on Linode are far better. Linode has IPv6. Linode has a very decent Nodebalancer.<p>DO wins on memory / price and Control Panel. Other then that Linode wins. Linode now also offer metered per hour billing ( in beta ).",1391490084

3948305,comment,3946856,3947275,2,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"Its true that most of the time, merging files by ""shuffling the decks together"" works pretty ok.  Many small changes are independent, even most.<p>But sometimes they're not, and there is no way on earth the merge tool can distinguish.  E.g. I fix a bug by incrementing a counter in the caller; you fix it my incrementing in the subroutine. Merge: now we have a new bug, the counter is incremented twice.<p>Another simple, irreconcilable issue is files that contain lists of things.  I want to add two more items to the list; you add three. Merging, we have a 'conflict': we've both changed the end of the file.  The merge here would have been trivial: add all the lines. But the merge tool cannot intuit from a text file, which kind of change it was: list edit or algorithmic change.<p>A database instead of a text file can help, as long as the schema allows sufficiently complex description to help the merge tool, and that would require considerable foresight on the part of the database designer.",1336568347

That's not to say that there aren't more small teams with laughable ideas out there, but I think it's important to note that nobody gave them money.  I suspect they went home empty handed because the folks who manage VC funds did learn from the mistakes of the 90s, even if a new generation of wantrepeneurs have no clue.<p>Which brings me to my point.  The niche based thinking expressed by the poetry disruptors and many others is an expression of the realization that individual programmers have the ability to work alone to create products and businesses that are capable of supporting them financially in much the same way that a sole proprietorship would in the physical world.<p>I'm fairly certain that this wasn't possible in the 90s without outside help, but I think that it explains a lot of the misguided enthusiasm from people who want to build lifestyle businesses, but don't realize that venture capital is not the way to go about it.",1336567421

Basically, having no assignments yields new ways to glue code together. It is somewhat similar to the benefits of structured programming as opposed to goto's.<p>Also, functional languages such as Haskell don't forbid mutability/effects, they just make them explicit. This is only a handicap in the sense that it makes some types of changes more difficult (e.g: Adding an effect to code that previously did not have one). But this has enormous advantages, because there are so many interesting things we can do when we have the guarantee that things have no effects when they actually don't.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pd...</a>",1336566198

They could be corn, or property, or jelly futures. But as it happens, technology companies are where a lot of people are putting their money right now.<p>As a result, it's not the startups with the secure bottom line that are getting investment: it's shiny startups that happen to be very popular. Because those are the ones that look great in an investment portfolio, and which could potentially be sold elsewhere. It's not about dividends over time; it's about passing on a shiny valuable to someone else for a cash return.<p>Given that premise, it seems like two things need to happen for the bubble to burst:<p>- The odds of an investment going bad must increase (or the <i>perceived</i> odds) / the perceived value of shiny startups in general must decrease<p>- Another arbitrary, shiny container for investment must arise<p>Thanks to the banking crisis, we know that property and related investments are going to be tainted for a little while. What else out there could threaten the startup market today? How about in five years?",1336565920

Don't pay attention to big-company politics and (unlike me) stay the fuck away from eng-misc. Work hard and (unless you're on a good project) figure out what transfer opportunities will be available, and which ones will be good. At the 18-month point, try for a promotion. It makes it easier to transfer. If you don't get the promo, you can still transfer; it's just somewhat harder. If your performance ratings are still at ""Meets Expectations"" you should have a good story as to why. In that case, you need to find that middle ground of (a) making it obvious that your manager's appraisal of you is boneheadedly wrong, (b) without throwing him under the bus.<p>The objective sign of a decent manager is whether his or her reports get promoted. Good managers (at Google) get their reports promoted and bad managers don't. It's that simple. Look into this when you're evaluating transfer opportunities. If you find that a group has a lot of really good people stuck at SWE 3, stay away from it, even if the work sounds interesting.

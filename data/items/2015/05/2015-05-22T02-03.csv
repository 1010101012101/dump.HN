While you might have your scripts to fit your needs for setting up your servers on AWS, what if you have users that are trying to deploy your cool app don&#x27;t have access to your scripts or the understanding to even use them if you handed them over? What if you could ensure that your app was 100% setup correctly with everything needed regardless of the underlying OS? Docker helps make that happen.<p>The best example I can personally give you that shows the value and power of docker is with my experience with the forum software Discourse [1]. Being an Ops guy, I wanted to install it on CentOS 7 without their Docker setup and it took me a lot of time and effort to get it to work correctly. I recently set it up again for a demo for a group of people to check out and I didn&#x27;t have the time to do a manual install, so I used their Docker method. I had it up and running in under 30min on CentOS 7. It was great and updating the forum down the road was very easy as a result of using the Docker method too. My manual install has a bunch of work involved to update it correctly and as a result, I don&#x27;t updated it as frequently.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/discourse/discourse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/discourse/discourse</a>",1432263190

Users who care about positions of astronomical objects can refer to that.  UTC was always a bit of a compromise, which partly tracked UT1, but only up to the nearest second.<p>On the other hand, I think the idea of abolishing leap seconds is to no longer derive wall time from earth rotation, and to derive it from atomic time instead. So &quot;UTC&quot; would still refer to &quot;the source of wall time&quot;. As I understand it, this is the point of changing the derivation of UTC: there are lots of laws in different countries that say that wall clock time is tied to UTC, so if we want to switch from earth rotation to atomic time, it is easier to change the definition of UTC than to change the laws in all those countries.",1432262904

This is NOT fair.<p>You are the <i>partial</i> beneficiary; the person who has used your money has also benefited from it. They have accomplished business goals and produced goods and services that they could not have without capital, and the price of that capital (a percentage return on the funding raised) is worth access to that capital without access to its associated risk. This is a fundamental tenet of capitalism - exchanges and transactions are only entered into when they are mutually beneficial. Somehow, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts!<p>> If I have 20 million dollars in a stable fund that grows 10% a year, that means I get 2 million a year sitting on my ass. The majority of people in the US will not never even touch 2 million in their lifetime. You want to justify that kind of compensation by saying that index funds still involve certain risk?<p>If you have 20 million in a stable fund, that&#x27;s 20 million dollars of capital that is being used to promote other businesses and to produce goods and capital that otherwise may not be produced, and it&#x27;s 20 million dollars when <i>you can lose overnight</i>. Again, the value contributed is not the labor, but capital and assumption of risk has a very real impact and is an absolutely necessary part of the equation. The capital holder is enriching both himself <i>and</i> the person in whom he is invested. The capital holder is happy because his risk yields dividends, and the capital consumer is happy because his labor yields dividends, and you&#x27;re right, the capitalist didn&#x27;t put in the labor, but the laborer <i>didn&#x27;t have to put in the capital</i>.  Neither could do it nearly as effectively without the other. The relationship is symbiotic, not parasitic.<p>> bubbles pop and industries heal, the economy goes up in aggregate, and many rich people stay rich or get richer in extreme and extravagant ways that are grossly un-proportional to the amount of work they output.<p>Bubbles pop (with investors in risky ventures/funds eating the brunt of that), industries heal (certainly not overnight, and during those recoveries, it is again the capital-holders who bear the financial burden), the economy does go up in aggregate (because it&#x27;s not zero-sum, which is why laborers benefit even if the rich get richer), but are you suggesting that earnings should be directly proportional to the labor invested?

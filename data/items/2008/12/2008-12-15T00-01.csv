Pick one and try it out on a small but non-trivial task. Then make small changes and iterate. Maybe let some friends play with different flavors of it. This may take more work but the end result will probably be more genuinely useful and your language will probably find more users.",1229302742

397816,comment,397343,397396,0,0,netcan,,,"Thanks for the link. To me, this is a very interesting topic area. You, the linked post & the many follow up articles seem to rely on two quite different reasons for this issue.<p><i>The big outsource companies making up such a large section of the IT market have ugly business models. They get the kind of work where quality & innovation are not actually real competitive advantages & the bill by the hour on a cost+ basis. They're poisoning the industry everywhere from Universities to corporate culture.<p></i>Indian culture is creating problems. I've heard variations on this theme. Mostly they centre around family expectations & such pushing young individuals towards being risk averse.<p>The former, I think might not really be a 'problem' as it seems. The availability of secure jobs (especially places where parents have a memory of this not being the case) will bring in employees. They would have been Accountants or hairdressers if that is where good solid careers lay.<p>But, maybe they also make this career path accessible to those that otherwise would have been accountants or whatever.<p>Sure, these companies may not be the best possible for creating a thriving startup/innovation city. Maybe a Lenova or a Google would have been better. But that doesn't mean that these companies are a net loss.",1229302324

397813,comment,397739,397739,0,0,larrykubin,,,"Been there, done that. Worked at a government/university job for about 2 years. Very few people there cared about programming or software whatsoever. It's hard to stay motivated about anything when no one around you is fired up or cares about being there.<p>Used a programming language similar to COBOL that made me want to bang my head against the wall. Features that would normally be trivial to implement were almost impossible. Took forever to get any code moved to production. Took about a year of meetings to do something as simple as installing MySQL. Version control = Excel Spreadsheets and folders. Any suggestion to use a new tool required a special committee, more meetings, etc. No one wanted to learn anything new.<p>While you will have extra time to work on your own thing, you might lose your motivation and joy, and gradually become apathetic. I quit 2 years ago, and am doing much better as a freelancer.",1229302090

397811,comment,397739,397739,0,0,ghshephard,,,"75th Percentile for Sr. Developers with a strong framework experience in the valley is $150K right now.  Plus the options upside (Which should hopefully come through every third or fourth company you work for).<p>Yes, during a death march, you do tend to stay working after 5:00 PM, and possibly even work on weekends.<p>But, once you get into year three or four, a properly managed software shop should see those pushes for just three or four weeks a year, and it's not uncommon to see engineers putting in 30 hour work weeks the rest of the year.<p>Of course the whole roller coaster of layoffs is still pretty valid - but if you are a good developer, jobs are pretty easy to come by once you've built up your network, and you can treat the off time as vacation.  There is a reason why recruiters make $20K-25K (minimum) for tracking down high performance developers - they are hard to find.<p>If you are an average developer, having to deal with 6 month to 2 year sabbaticals might suck, and I can see why the government job approach might make sense.<p>My conclusion: Rock stars should look to being principal developers for private concerns, others should consider all their options based on their needs.",1229302032

397805,comment,397739,397739,0,0,bwd,,,"Given how deeply some of the state and local governments are in the hole in this financial crisis, has anyone given any serious thought as to how safe government pensions really are?  The two possible scenarios that worry me the most about our current situation are commercial real estate problems being as bad as residential and the failure of a large state or municipality (e.g. Michigan or Detroit) to be able to meet its debt and pension obligations, which might set off a chain reaction in the municipal bond market of the magnitude that we saw in the commercial paper market after the failure of Lehman.  Is there a backstop similar to PBGC available for public sector plans (couldn't find one with a few minutes of research) or is the Federal government the only possible source of help?",1229301024

397795,comment,397721,397721,0,0,iamdave,,,"Making the comparison of the WP Theme Directory to the iPhone App store was just short of kitschy for the sake of relevance.  There's a lot of differences between the App Store and the WP Theme directory; the <i>only</i> similarity between the two is that as mentioned the relevant content (themes) link to the central distribution hub.<p>But unlike the App Store, if you want a premium theme you can look elsewhere.  Distribution isn't a problem with themes.  Some discerning developers have found ways to deliver their own apps for the iPhone but the modus operandi is to use iTunes.<p>Secondly, the spirit of WP is Open Source.  Not so much with the App Store.  It's proprietary to Apple, applications that are built are the property of the developers (to my knowledge, if the TOS says differently, someone correct me).  With WordPress themes, by the nature of GPL you are free to edit them to fit your own needs.<p>So no, removing a theme from the directory is NOT akin to removing something from the app store, and saying so is just wrongfully begging for some false sense of relevance.",1229300042

I would too if I get a dollar for every three you made. But that's where the outcompetition ends. Private sector wins for efficiency, innovation, and general business competitiveness.<p>Get a government job if you want to be financially fed from a tube til death, probably doing tedious, monotonous work. You can stay in your cage where Farmer feeds you on the clock; those of us who have a passion for what we do will continue to live in the wild.<p>Related is PG's essay on the nature of the employee in a startup as opposed to in a corporation, although in this case the contrast is between the private and public sectors.",1229299980

Dick (American)[0][1] and Olaf Stapledon (English). \nHe has two essays in which he analyzes Stapledon two great works: Last and First Men, and Star Maker[2].<p>I think you might also be suffering from a filter. The best of Polish writers were translated, whereas you have access to the glut of all American writers.

Those are a little lightweight, are actually angle quotes, not angle brackets. Actual angle brackets aren&#x27;t available on my keyboard, but would look like:<p><pre><code>  from_str::⟨Option⟨uint⟩⟩\n</code></pre>\nJeez, why does Unicode have so many different variations on angle brackets? The above are &quot;mathematical left/right angle bracket&quot;, but there&#x27;s also:<p><pre><code>  from_str::〈Option〈uint〉〉\n</code></pre>\nWhich uses &quot;left/right-pointing angle bracket&quot; and:<p><pre><code>  from_str::〈Option〈uint〉〉\n</code></pre>\nWhich uses &quot;left/right angle bracket&quot;<p>At least in the font I&#x27;m typing this in, the &quot;left/right-pointing angle brackets&quot; look the best to me.

While alcohol isn&#x27;t an <i>illegal</i> drug let there be no mistake that it is absolutely a drug in every sense of the word and there is high risk of abuse, dependence, and harm. A huge number of people die each year from the abuse of alcohol. AA exists for a reason and you can buy beer almost anywhere.<p>But let&#x27;s not talk about drugs that pose a mortal risk for a moment. Instead, let&#x27;s focus on the topic at hand which is psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, etc... These all carry different risk profiles individually but overall it is safe to say that risk of dependence or lethal overdose are several magnitudes less than that of alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, or opiates. Yes, there is always the chance of a bad trip and it is entirely possible that poor decisions are made on LSD or mushrooms (if you are making poor decisions while on DMT, it would only be in conversations you&#x27;re having in your head as you aren&#x27;t walking about on that drug). I also don&#x27;t know anyone addicted to LSD.<p>And while I&#x27;ve heard of few people having life-changing positive breakthroughs while trash drunk on alcohol or buzzing from nicotine, I have met scores of people who have had such experiences on comparatively safe psychedelics.<p>As you say, prohibition has run its course especially for psychedelic drugs and must end. Are there &#x27;bad&#x27; drugs out there? Absolutely! But there are many more positive ways to deal with them through education and resources.",1410620269

Furthermore, neither Slack nor Hipchat are available for fee if you want to use it at its full potential.<p>Most importantly, with ChatGrape we&#x27;re going beyond of simply providing a chat based communication solution. On ChatGpape, we&#x27;re offering a  smart engine that automatically triggers workflows based on your communication, such as, let&#x27;s meet at 2pm tomorrow - automatically adds a calendar event.<p>There&#x27;s more than that, of course, but the essence is that we&#x27;re running a quite extensive engine in the background to make your team&#x27;s communication easier and more efficient, and that takes up actual processing power.<p>Finally, considering that our aim to to save you time that you can use better on building your own baby, instead of wasting time searching for documents you ant to share and issues you want to reference - the average startup using ChatGrape has access to all the features for around 35 bugs per month, which is really a reasonable price, don&#x27;t you think?",1410617325

8312399,comment,8309490,8312164,1,0,throwawaykf05,,,"The term of a patent has nothing to do with independent invention, it is meant to allow an inventor an opportunity to capture the rewards of their invention. Both licensing and product development (even for software) can take many years to happen, and 4 or 5 years is laughably inadequate. Not to mention, of course, that patent offices take a few years for a patent to grant in the first place. What advantage is a patent if it expires just in time for others to start ripping you off?<p>In any case, I am not aware of any quantitative study of independent invention. But using patents as a sample, considering only 0.1% being involved in interferences and that only 0.1% of issued patents ever being asserted, one rough guess could be that most patentable ideas are never independently re-invented. On the other hand, given how narrow patents usually are, this is not surprising. Then again, most patents are licensed without litigation, and these deals are confidential, so this is a really rough guess.<p><i>> … Against Intellectual Monopoly …</i><p>Heh, I guessed that would come up. Unfortunately, that book contains many fabrications and mischaracterizations of other work, which calls into question anything they say.

The second comment linked above links a few studies showing the beneficial effects of patents and ends with a reference to a more balanced and honest overview of the current state of patent economics.

I still feel like bumping into interesting people by trial-and-error is less than optimal, but I am generally introverted so my number of trials may be below average.<p>But beyond filtering of people, there's many other social-augmentation things you could do - I'd quite like a face-recognition remind me of their name thing.

So, you need to identify the actual target group, provide them some more information about the problem you're aiming to solve and ask about details of the problem - not the solution (as some of the questions in you survey are). So, people who have this problem will provide you with info without any inncentives. Those who don't feel any problem - will quit but that's ok coz they're not your target group.

It's either that or go home, which I do frequently as well. But it very much depends on the kind of people I am with  in many cases it's not just colleagues or people I find interesting in terms of technological background: they are my actual friends (not Facebook-friends).<p>And despite getting smashed I've still had a lot of interesting conversations and discussions with people in the same setting. I don't want to call anyone out which is why I won't name names, but I think all (three) conferences I attended last year had an ""open bar"" at some point and it was still worth while.<p>One was an amazing weekend of great talks, conversations, food and drinks.<p>And I don't regret going to any of these either. For starters, I can stop whenever I want and go back to my hotel or go home. I can still stay around and not drink anything and chat with others all night if I want to. Or do the opposite and have a drink with them.<p>I personally caught myself pondering about how you keep a level of professionalism  e.g. when you see your work mates (and/or superiors) drunk all the time, how do you keep the respect around?<p>We hired a lot of people in the last two years and while it's good to be friends with everyone you work with, I think there is a gray area of how far you want to go. There is work and after-work and in the end, some people manage it and others do not. For myself, I just decided to not shift into last gear when I go out with them and that means I can still have a good time and even have a drink if I want to. Got that much self-control (or maybe just fear of the next day).<p>I'm not sure I agree on a ban for alcohol from conferences. I can see where you're coming from and I'd like to think people should consume within reason, but I'm sure that doesn't really work out at all. At least for the majority. In the end it's always freedom of choice.<p>I give you that though: Maybe drinks should not be free so people don't get wasted right on.

3801895,comment,3801603,3801671,0,0,marklindhout,,,"> ""But it works""<p>No it does not. It fails on the following points:<p>1. Readability: Both headings and excertp text have the same colour. This creates uncertainty about what is what. Same applies to the various other page elements like the tag cloud.<p>2. Readability: Contrast ratios. This is for many a subjective matter, but displays are very capable of displaying black text on a white background. If you want to decrease glare, you should make the text lighter (#333 is popular) but not the background darker. Tis decreases readability on many devices, especially with LCD displays.<p>3. Readability: White space and liune height. On the left, there's a overly generous amount of white space. This is not bad, but it fails horribly when in the right column the white space is not considered at all. This gives the page a messy, chaotic look.<p>4. Readbility: CAPITALS. This has already been discussed above, but I'd like to recap. Captials are considered shouting in online written text. Capitals decrease readability by making all characters similar in size, therefor creating less visual anchors for the reader to attach to. This leads to losing the thread of the sentence. This, by the way, is also why there are special titling and/or all-capital fonts included in typefaces.<p>5. Readability: Dots in titles. That's not how you write 'READ. POSTS'.<p>6. Visual consistency: Page elements seem to have no, or very little relationship to each other. Normally this is conveyed through colour, contrast, size and shape. Many parts of this page fail in at least 3 of these, severly degrading the usability of the site as an interactive application.<p>7. Usability: There is almost no visual feedback for the interactivity besides the hand-cursor. This is bad for usability.<p>8. Usability: Aggresive social media sahring pop-up. The very sensitive pop-up menu makes using the other links hard.<p>My conclusion must be that this page was designed by either a programmer or a print designer. I lean towards programmer because of the colour scheme.<p>So, no, it does not 'work'. It's quite possibly the worst newslisting I've seen, and I thought Reddit was bad.",1333618107

It was not easy to link addresses to real-life locations. They made Google Maps. Google Code made it easy to find out code extracts.

With the JS implementation of Notch's 16-bit CPU you can even quickly paste Notch's CPU into BrowserQuest, so that you can write with his opcodes!<p>To the extent that it's not a <i>feature</i> but a <i>game mechanic</i> I would say it's interesting enough for one HN post in the top 10. That's what it was recently, and all was good. Today implementations of the opcodes take up <i>four</i> of these posts, for apparently no other reason than ""Notch is a pretty cool guy with the ability to make this happen.""<p>And that's my point.

You are responding to arguments you are imagining I am making.<p>> Sorry to ruin your party. But there are languages where there are exponential gains in productivity with time. Languages like Lisp, Perk, Haskell etc.<p>Get off your high horse. Lisp, Perl, Haskell aren't some exclusive club only you are allowed into. I have used Racket, Clojure, Python, Ruby etc. and if your gains are exponential accumulated over a period of 1 month between say Python and Racket, be assured you are a very lousy Python programmer. Let alone exponential, a gain of even 2x is quite a stretch. Why don't you put your money where your mouth is and show me your 'exponential gains'?",1333616503

1. Chalk up one more for SICP. I got started via the ebook. I'll probably shoot for 80% coverage of the exercises.

</code></pre>
If one of them has a distinguishing mark, they have an apostrophe: (in jail, has red hair, or born first)<p><pre><code>    G'g, B'g, G'b, B'b, Gg', Bg', Gb', Bb'
</code></pre>
Then note that the marked one is a girl:<p><pre><code>    G'g, G'b, Gg', Bg'
</code></pre>
So, there is a 50% change that the children are a boy and a girl. Only if there is no way to distinguish them, do you get the 66% behaviour, where the set is:<p><pre><code>    Gg, Bg, Gb</code></pre>",1230853012

Personally I haven't looked back.  Nothing is guaranteed, you need to personally decide more which you will regret most: quitting now, taking the risk and going for it, or waiting till till later when the economy might be better, but then you're personal circumstances might have changed.  At the end of the day - it has to be your decision, but if you do genuinely have 3-4 years of cash, then go for it!",1230852684

Think of yourself as multidimensional -- having knowledge of doing more than web app software.<p>My undergrad is in Electrical Engineering. I designed industrial data monitoring & control equipment for a few years, then started doing embedded software. Got an MS in software engineering. Did more embedded, did some MFC stuff, dabbled in cgi scripts and Zope for a while. Somewhere in there had a small 2-person side business building temperature monitoring equipment for a few years. Now working on movie camera motion control. I'm about as far from Web 2.0 as you're going to get :-)<p>I like it here and I also hang out on Spolsky's  Business of Software forum.

 - They're accessing it during class time or hogging the computer labs/library throughout the day and IE6 is the only browser on the majority of the machines on campus.
 - IE7 is on a smaller percentage (a quarter perhaps) of machines within the campus - still a hefty percentage - no alternative browsers anywhere.
 - Their home laptops have never been windows-updated and still run IE6, or those that have WU'd run IE7.<p>The only times Chrome, Safari or FF hit the app is when the computing students use it - and they tend to not be my demographic because they don't store every detail of their life on social networks whereas the IE6 loving social-studies students do.",1230851703

416774,comment,416402,416402,0,0,fhars,,,"The question is ill posed, because the anwser is highly dependent on how the couple told you that they have one girl.<p>If they tell you ""we have two kids"", you ask them if at least one of them is a girl and they answer ""yes"", then indeed the probability of the other kid beeing a boy is 2/3.<p>If they tell you ""we have two kids, and one of them is a girl"", then by all rules of rational discourse the probability for the other kid being a boy is 1.<p>Things start to get interesting if the talking member of the couple is a mathematician (so the rules of ordinary discourse do not apply) and he says ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a girl"". Now you might say that this is equivalent two the first case. But you could also go bayesian and look at the possible conversations with couples containing at least one mathematician that have two kids. Say you have 100 couples. On average, 25 of these will have two boys and tell you ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a boy"", another 25 will have two girls and tell you ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a girl"". The remaining 50 couples will have one boy and one girl. Assuming no gender bias on behalf of the speaking mathematician (ha!), 25 of these will tell you ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a boy"", while the remaining 25 will say ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a girl."" So out of the 50 couples that tell you ""We have two kids, and at least one of them is a girl,"" 25 will have two girls, and 25 will have a boy and a girl. So in this case, the correct answer is 1/2.<p>(This is essentially the argument from the intro on this page that was linked from the discussion on coding horror: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/my-bayesian-enl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/10/my-bayesian-enl.html</a> )",1230851564

I didn't want to give up my job because I needed the health insurance. But my job was making my health worse. I quit and second guessed myself for a long time afterwards. But two years later I am fighting fit again. Thinking back, my only question is, why did I wait so long to do what was in my best interest? Most people who knew me thought I had the best job in the world. But I was miserable. For several years (!) I listened to them instead of myself and made my health even worse. Complete and utter irrationality combined with a lack of self-confidence. In the end I only did it because I had to, not because I am a shining example of courage. I really thought I was throwing everything away and yet I was so wrong. Let my stupidity be your guide. Oh, and the company went under after I quit. So much for throwing away my security. The question is really much simpler than you think.",1230851435

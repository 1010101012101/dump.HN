It doesn&#x27;t matter if the well known server is a &quot;peer&quot; that happens to be running the same software, or if it&#x27;s the BitTorrent DHT bootstrap servers, what matters is that that peer has a disproportionate amount of authority and influence over the network, amounting to a single point of censorship or failure.<p>NAT (and firewalls anywhere except the networked computer - even at the subscriber&#x27;s router) contribute to/create this asymmetry, where one side has to beg to connect to another, and so everyone winds up settling on the most-memorable 3rd party.

8230805,comment,8228459,8229027,1,0,possibilistic,,,"I have a moderately informed opinion that might change as I learn more.<p>It seems that a few bad drone pilots are causing problems for all of the good actors in the system. Since there is so much potential for injury, and since it only takes one terrible incident to bring down stiff regulation on everyone, <i>perhaps drone piloting should become a licensed activity or sport</i>.<p>Establishing drone pilot licensing would theoretically ensure that legal, licensed pilots are aware of the risks and are willing to assume greater personal liability in the event of operator negligence. The hobby would gain legitimate legal grounding and become less &quot;cowboy&quot; more or less overnight. I can&#x27;t imagine it would be remain crowded with careless risk takers.<p>If this is done early, before any major incident or bad press, the FAA won&#x27;t have to step in and put more rules and regulations in place. If there are to be new rules, I imagine that they wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as overbearing for a well-behaved professional hobby that doesn&#x27;t needlessly put health and lives at risk.<p>I think professional hobbyist (not an oxymoron?) drone pilots should lobby lawmakers for something like this to take place as soon as possible, before the FAA starts making mandates. I can certainly see the FAA&#x27;s concerns--there is legitimate risk and danger. Something will eventually happen that brings the entire house of cards down. If the drone pilots don&#x27;t ask for this self-regulation themselves, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be against the FAA moving ahead on its own.<p>On a personally related note, I&#x27;m involved in hobbyist high-wattage laser projection for making video games and interactive displays. (I think there are videos linked from my HN profile). The entire lasing community cringes when there is news of some idiot shining a laser pointer at a plane or when someone is caught using a high-wattage laser for destructive purposes. It&#x27;s a seemingly regular occurrence, and I&#x27;m pretty certain there will be regulation coming down the pipeline eventually. It seems there is no shortage of careless ignorance when it comes to dangerous hobbies.",1409111904

8230799,comment,8230458,8230458,2,0,dj-wonk,,,"I see a big theoretical and practical problem with Figure 2&#x27;s projection of a 3D center of gravity to our planet&#x27;s surface. For now, lets ignore all the other problems (e.g. does calculating a &quot;center&quot; really help answer useful questions).<p>The 2D projection only shows &quot;non-radial&quot; movements (e.g. shifts not pointed towards the earth&#x27;s core). For example, if the center of gravity moves directly to the other side of the planet, the 2D projection won&#x27;t change until the 3D point passes through the core, at which point the projection would jump wildly to the other side of the planet.<p>This is probably quite similar to what has really happened. I&#x27;d expect that the westward shift from AD 1 to 1950 had much to do with the growth in the Americas. Afterwards, I&#x27;d expect growth in India, China, and Japan moved the center eastward.",1409111823

8230791,comment,8229081,8230693,3,0,aetherson,,,"I think that how &quot;big&quot; the taxi business is is mostly a red herring, and that viewing it as a cynical ploy of taxi companies is an un-nuanced reading of the situation.<p>Rather, I think that the deal is that taxi regulators work with taxi companies and taxi drivers.  Day in and day out, for, at this point, generations.  Taxi companies and taxi drivers advocate for their interests and beliefs, as of course they do and should, both to the people in their local Taxi and Limousine Commission or local equivalent, and also to city councilors and such on the fairly rare occasions when those people take up taxi regulation.<p>The size of the market is to a large degree irrelevant.  The taxi companies are going to advocate their interests -- mostly informally and without thinking of themselves as lobbying -- whether they&#x27;re in a $5 million market or a $50 million market.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter how big objectively the taxi market is -- however big it is, it&#x27;s their livelihood.<p>Taxi regulatory practices will be subjected to democratic scrutiny only rarely.  Honestly, prior to Uber bringing all this into the spotlight, how much thought did you give to taxi regulations?  Most people I&#x27;ve spoken do didn&#x27;t even know what a medallion system entailed.  It&#x27;s a minor and bureaucratic subject that the ordinary people are typically uninterested in.  Similarly, government officials who want to make a big showy example of rooting out corruption probably do not gravitate to TLC jobs -- it&#x27;s just not that big a deal, and not that high profile.<p>In that environment, you&#x27;ll often see a slow process of regulatory capture.  And indeed, it&#x27;s hard to argue that the taxi industry was not marked by regulatory capture.<p>But it&#x27;s a mistake to imagine, because of that, a shadowy cabal of well-heeled businessmen with a gigantic presence behind them.  Uber is the big business, not the taxi companies.  The taxi companies have had a cushy deal, but that&#x27;s through a slow accretion of generations of largely informal &quot;lobbying,&quot; not a backroom power-brokering deal.",1409111499

Claiming hadoop is now some distribution of tools is fine, but that&#x27;s simply not what the common usage is.</i><p>I am a Hadoop developer, and I can tell you that Hadoop does not mean &quot;map-reduce + hdfs&quot;.  That&#x27;s also not what people are installing when they install Cloudera&#x27;s distribution of Hadoop, Hortonworks&#x27; distribution of Hadoop, or even Intel&#x27;s distribution of Hadoop (which is being discontinued in favor of adopting Cloudera&#x27;s).  This is more old information from 2008, being replayed as current.  YARN even lives in the Hadoop source code repository, it&#x27;s hard to get more &quot;Hadoop&quot; than that.  Spark has its own repo, but it uses many classes from Hadoop like InputFormat, etc.<p><i>It remains to be seen if yarn will carry the day or no; my suspicion is that many people are essentially going to be running spark on hdfs.

Much sadness.<p>You run YARN (or its close competitor, Mesos) because you want to have multiple jobs going on in the same cluster at once.

8230761,comment,8228581,8229845,1,0,colin_mccabe,,,"Messages like this make me sad.  Hadoop hasn&#x27;t been &quot;Yahoo&#x27;s Hadoop&quot; since at least 2008.  MapReduce is deprecated in favor of newer frameworks like Cloudera Impala and Apache Spark.  These tools are years old.  If you are still discussing 2008 software as if it were current, you&#x27;re giving people a very false picture of what is out there.<p><i>Further, avoiding having every reducer have to have high throughput network to every mapper is key; the hadoop design makes it difficult to optimize over network topology like higher within-rack bandwidth.</i><p>Hadoop was designed around rack topologies where bandwidth within racks was higher than bandwidth between them.  That is why it tries to place mappers near where the data is that the mappers will be reading.  The general assumption is that mappers will be generating a much smaller data set than what they&#x27;re reading.  If that&#x27;s not true, then yes, you may have locality issues.  You can solve this problem by writing your own InputFormat.<p><i>There are far better designs implemented: never write to local disk from the mappers, instead writing to a global dfs then performing the sort in the dfs. I worked for a company that took hadoop 0.17 and made it roughly 10x more performant (and not on toy datasets: on petabyte scale datasets) with roughly 10 engineer-years with this design.</i><p>There have been a bunch of projects to optimize MapReduce, like Sailfish.  But ultimately higher-level optimizations like avoiding spilling between different phases of a multi-stage job (like Spark implements) are more important.  And Impala implements a ton of join optimizations, of course, as well as doing absolutely everything it can in memory.<p><i>Finally, the hdfs design is pretty shitty, on two fronts: the namenode gets slow (choking everyone), and the disk-based format is missing lots of things to enable optimizations like certain types of append, or indexing. Indexing is incredibly powerful for things like join, enabling a map-side join instead of having to read all your data once, sort by join keys, then reread in your reducers.</i><p>In practice, the HDFS NameNode only gets slow if you create lots of small files.<p>There are plenty of external indices you can put on top of HDFS.  For example, you can run HBase.  Or if you don&#x27;t want to run another daemon, you can use Apache Parquet or Apache ORCFile... file formats which are inherently indexed.<p><i>Another problem with hdfs design is capacity adding; hdfs has shitty rebalancing tools. The typical problem is this: hot data is new data. So if you add capacity to hdfs, your old capacity is say 80% full and your new capacity is 0% full so where does all new data go? To the new capacity. Which is quickly 100% saturated and choking your jobs.</i><p>This is completely untrue.  By default, HDFS doesn&#x27;t make any attempt to load balance between disks or nodes at the moment; it will keep writing until the disk / node fills up.  The sysadmin must run the balancer to move things around between full and less-full nodes.  I don&#x27;t think any version of HDFS ever implemented the behavior you talk about as the default.<p><i>hdfs&#x27; use of triple replication (well, you can actually set the replication level) instead of better algorithms like erasure encoding does no favors to performance as well.</i><p>Erasure encoding isn&#x27;t better for all use cases, only for cold data.  Sometime you want those replicas.  At some point, I expect HDFS will get RAID support, as well.<p>To be honest, it&#x27;s rare to see a cluster where lack of disk space is a problem.  With 20 4 TB disk drives on each node, optimizing for reduced disk space is a bit foolish unless you profile and find that I/O is indeed the bottleneck.<p>It&#x27;s really depressing to read anything about Hadoop on Hacker News.  It seems like people talk about 2008 software and Hadoop 0.20 as though it were current.  Nobody talks about Windows XP as though that were the latest version of Windows (which it was in 2006), but somehow talking about the shortcomings Hadoop 0.20 and other ancient stuff is considered topical.",1409110533

A small sample:<p>* Do Economists Reach a Conclusion on Taxi Deregulation (<a href=""http://www.emmanuelcombe.org/moor.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emmanuelcombe.org/moor.pdf</a>)<p>>  Because taxis are more expensive than other transit services, they must offer something that other transit modes do not. In particular, taxi services are important to certain segments of the population. Seniors, housewives, the disabled, and the poor each account for a much higher share of taxi trips than their share of the population (Rosenbloom 1985; Weiner 1982).<p>* Factors Affecting the Use of Taxicaps by Lower Income Groups (<a href=""http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=92135"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=92135</a>)<p>>  Previous studies and our data suggest that the poor often choose taxis because they are the principal option when an automobile is not available. Taxis appear to be chosen over conventional transit (when it exists) because they offer greater service flexiblity, convenience, and duration of service, as well as better meeting the security demands of the poor. Increased availability of taxi service by reduced market entry restrictions and reduced cost of taxi service by permitting group riding and providing subsidies would increase the mobility of the poor.<p>* Subsidized Taxi Programs for Elderly and Handicapped Persons in the SFBay Area (<a href=""http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=70030"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=70030</a>)<p>> The objectives of the report are: (1) to describe six programs which deliver transportation service to elderly and handicapped persons utilizing the subsidized taxi mode; (2) to identify the essential similarities and differences among these programs; (3) to illustrate, in qualitative terms, the nature of the costs, efficiencies and impacts on taxi operators, subsidizers, and users of the six approaches; and (4) to interpret this information and identify those findings which appear to be transferable to planners in other localities. The subsidized taxi programs are successfully delivering transportation service to elderly and handicapped residents in all locations as evidenced by rising client enrollment and ridership volumes. Overall, response to the programs has been and continues to be extremely favorable.<p>* The determination of acccessible taxi requirements (<a href=""https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/2284"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/2284</a>)<p>> This report describes the results of a programme of ergonomic research undertaken to provide a scientific basis for the generation of regulations concerned with the introduction of accessible taxis in the UK.<p>* Modeling urban taxi services with multiple user classes and vehicle modes (<a href=""http://front.cc.nctu.edu.tw/Richfiles/22015-Wong-Wong-Yang-Wu-2003-02-20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://front.cc.nctu.edu.tw/Richfiles/22015-Wong-Wong-Yang-W...</a>)<p>> One of the main issues is the provision of several modes of taxi services in many large cities. For instance, \nthere has recently been a concern about the provision of easily accessible taxis for the handicapped, whose travel characteristics are very different from those of other customers.<p>* Compromise & constraint: Examining the nature of transport disability in the context of local travel (<a href=""http://invent.newmobility.org/library/wt8-2.pdf#page=42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://invent.newmobility.org/library/wt8-2.pdf#page=42</a>)<p>> While major advances have been made over the last twenty years in the planning and provision of transport that is accessible to all, the links have not yet been effectively made between applied work on transport planning and the major developments in theoretical understandings of disability which have been taking place during a similar period. Existing studies have attempted to measure transport disability, but have generally failed to link it to wider theoretical or structural concerns, or to explore disabled people’s responses to transport disability.<p>* Taxi - Why Hailing a New Idea about Public Accommodation Laws May Be Easier Than Hailing a Taxi (<a href=""http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/valur37&div=25&id=&page="" rel=""nofollow"">http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/v...</a>)<p>> Municipal policies have also been developed to combat the problem, some demanding automatic confiscation of the cab if a complaint is alleged, others requiring cab drivers to take at least one fare a day to underserved neighborhoods or face suspension.",1409109961

I think what you mean is that teaching stats based on hypothesis testing on simple experiments with small samples is not the best way to introduce students to this world.  But the history of statistics was heavily influenced by designed experiments, while most of the data that is out there is observational.  That is hard for older generations of statisticians to swallow.",1409108866

8230694,comment,8226654,8228651,7,0,stephen_g,,,"$73 billion was the LNP&#x27;s figure, by the way, which involved some extremely questionable assumptions (such as despite the actual FTTP cost per premises dropping over time as the rollout was progressing, exactly like it did in other rollouts around the world, the LNP&#x27;s strategic review claims it would have doubled in the future for reasons which were redacted). I think even Fletcher admitted eventually that it would have been much more like the other sceneario, $56 billion, in reality. Still a bit more than Labor&#x27;s $44.1bn estimates, but nowhere near the LNP&#x27;s past ludicrous claims (they were saying up to $96bn).<p>Still would have been worth it at double the price to get rid of Telstra.

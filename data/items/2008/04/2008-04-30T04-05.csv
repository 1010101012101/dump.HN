Most of my friends have, at one stage or another, done a Thailand trip and returned with many tailored suits (and shirts) (and ties) (and dvds).<p>One couple I know have even booked their next Thailand visit for the weeks before my wedding in September, just so he can show up with a new suit!",1209531408

   WHERE `z2`.`ZIPcode = 'YOURZIPCODE'
   ORDER BY dist LIMIT 10

Might be faster if you do a query to get the lat and long for the ZIP code you need first, though. Hell, it would probably be fastest to skip the database all together and just import the data and loop the distance formula, recording the smallest distances as you go.",1209528902

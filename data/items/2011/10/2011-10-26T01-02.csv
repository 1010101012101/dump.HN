When someone can't keep an extremely small amount of cash on hand at all times. it doesn't mean they are living paycheck to paycheck and just netting zero - it means they are accruing debt every cycle, and then struggling to stay cash flow positive in any way necessary.<p>So, if you ask me, the solution to America's woes in this regard is not to eliminate overdraft fees. That's just addressing a symptom. The real solution is a living wage for all Americans, or some other way to prevent poor people from sinking into debt little by little. Then banks wouldn't construct their systems like this, because it just wouldn't work.<p>Instead of patching bandaids onto the financial system, we need to lift people up from poverty directly. Want to solve overdrafts? Tax the rich and give the money to the poor.<p>As for BankSimple, that's nice marketing and all, but let's see if BankSimple becomes the bank of the poor. Can anyone get a free bank account with BankSimple and keep $0-$500 in it?",1319594097

3156772,comment,3149360,3149360,1,0,snitko,,,"One important thing I got from this book is that we should judge economic policies not for the intentions they mean, but for the incentives they create.<p>I read a few (not too much, probably) books on economy both from the left and the right wing economists. An especially interesting turned out to be this one: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Economics-4th-Ed-Economy/dp/0465022529/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Basic-Economics-4th-Ed-Economy/dp/0465...</a> (lots of interesting facts in it, valuable even if you disagree with the point of view). I don't have any strong opinion about which side comes closer to the truth, but so far free market economists seemed to have much better arguments and be more convincing.<p>The reason many people disagree with certain economic policies and favor others are usually quite obvious: it's less riskier than dealing with the unfavorable policy. Human nature is to try to resist radical changes, such as looking for a better job or taking risks of starting your own company or, in general, investing time or money in your own welfare. Thus, the poor would prefer to stay where they are and let the government do the job of taking them out of poverty slowly, by asking rich to pay more taxes, because it is less riskier than acting on their lives themselves. The rich don't want to be moving their assets elsewhere or invest in enterprises outside their usual boundaries, because it is riskier than actually lobbying for the tax breaks. The real question is not who is currently oppressed or ""made"" poor, but rather what the intended policies, be it tax breaks for the rich or their abolishment, do to help those oppressed.<p>My guess is that government getting more tax money will not necessarily put them to work effectively, because by definition government is less effective than businesses. It has no incentives to be so. One might say, that it's still better than rich holding all the money to themselves creating no jobs at all. Maybe, and maybe not. Would the society really benefit if the government took the money from the rich and waste them on creating artificial jobs the country doesn't really need, or, would it be better if the rich kept the money to themselves up until the time they could see the opportunity to spend it effectively, creating the jobs that the economy as a whole really needs?",1319594007

3156762,comment,3154180,3154626,3,0,saurik,,,"Good direction, but bad conclusion: ""poor signal"" is not the same thing as ""congestion"". This fact is what causes TCP over any form of wireless (including high-speed WiFi) to have been a really bad decision (and one that academic researchers the world over love trying to solve ;P).<p>The reason is that TCP makes an assumption (almost entirely true in the case of physical cable) that ""packet loss"" is always caused by ""congestion"" (due to the router simply throwing away packets it cannot handle), and so if you are losing packets you need to slow down your rate of sending, to help more of them get through.<p>However, if the reason you are losing packets is ""poor signal"", then you are going to get a pretty much constant rate of packet loss: if 10% of your airwaves are ""damaged"", 10% of your packets are going to be lost whether you are sending them at 100k/s or 1b/s (as your choice of ""when to send"" is entirely random from the perspective of the interference: your device is not modeling the underlying issue so it can try to ""dodge the raindrops""; people work on this, though ;P).<p>The result is that when your signal is bad, even if you are currently getting 90k/s out after 10% loss, your standard TCP stack goes ""oh shit"" and starts dialing down its transmit window to ""virtually nothing"", leaving you unable to use that connection to get any data through anymore; even just opening a new connection when this happens (which may require restarting the app) tends to help tremendously.<p>(The solutions, for the record, all involve some sort of mechanism that allows explicit bookkeeping of either packet loss or congestion. However, this explicit bookkeeping requires various players that are not the device to be ""in on it"", and therefore makes it really hard to find the right balance of ""who needs to install better routers to solve the problem"", given the wide deployment of existing TCP... I mean, even getting IPv6 out there has been a tough sell, replacing IP entirely is a pipe-dream right now.)",1319593684

3156701,comment,3154743,3154743,4,0,dmfdmf,,,"> Windows XP needs to be not only the first ten-year operating system; it also needs to be the last.<p>I disagree with this.<p>I agree ten years is a long life for an OS now but sometime in the future that won't be true. The point is that the OS is a platform that should be stable and supported for years, if not decades. At some point the underlying technology and operation principles of an OS will plateau or reach diminished returns and a new OS will not be needed or just not worth the trouble.<p>Fast tracking OS releases today is really bad for all (except MS which is why they do it).  Vista came out 5 years after XP but it was not ready for prime time. Win7 came out 3 years after Vista and Win8 is slated for 3 years after the release of Win7. This 3 year OS cycle is insanity. One reason no one wanted to give up XP was because it worked, it was reasonably stable and no one wanted the pain and cost of moving to a new OS with all the inevitable driver and app problems. I'd bet that most of the new ""features"" of Win8 are really improved apps that would work fine on Win7 or completely unnecessary.  Sell new features in the old OS but make them standard in the new OS and release the new OS on approximately 5 year (and eventually longer) cycles when the fundamental functions of the OS <i>need</i> to change to improve security, efficiency or operation, not because MS needs revenue.<p>Win7 is a good OS, a worthy successor to XP, but we aren't even out of the Win7 adoption period (by users, hardware manufactures and ISV's) and we are suppose accept Win8 and stir the whole pot again?  I suspect that Win8 is going to have the same marketing problem that (in part) submarined Vista. People don't care about Operating Systems, they run them to run Applications.",1319592113

2. Having investors means having access to their networks, which is sometimes worth more than money.
3. If you bootstrap, every single dollar you make is yours. Also, every dollar you spend could have been yours to keep.
4. Without having investors freaking out about their 30x returns you might not move as fast as you could.
5. It is nice to have your investors pushing you outside your comfort zone (to give that talk, make that phone call).",1319591058
3156654,comment,3156304,3156304,4,0,xrd,,,"(I sold my company a year ago for $0.5M with me at 67% owner in a similar structure as you are describing, and another company six months ago for low six figures.)<p>Do it as a ""stock"" sale, rather than ""asset"" sale.  You get double taxed as an asset sale: first as corporate income, then as dividends which are taxed at zero-basis (unless you were very smart about how you paid into the company), meaning the whole thing will be taxed twice and at bad rates rather than capital gains, which are modest.  This is regardless of whether you lived in ramen for the last few years building it, which is probably as you described not having yet formed a company.  The buyers will probably want to do it as an asset sale, because this reduces liability; they are buying only the assets, not the entire company.  If you have customers, a stock sale has them purchasing the liabilities of those customers.  And, they can depreciate the assets, not stock.  But, you can state that you should get a higher price under an asset sale, or at least have it in your pocket when you ask them to give something up.<p>Make sure you have a good lawyer.  I know a great one in Seattle, contact me privately if you want his information.  You need to make sure you have good contracts.<p>Remember, the buyer will be less motivated in a year.  Excitement and possibility have a bad half life.  What leverage do you have if they decide to pay late, or tell you they cannot pay you the next year?  This situation is happening to me with the first of my deal.  The structure of my buyout was a three year deal, with a new company formed, with one of the buyers putting in a large cash payment up front to purchase 40% of the new company, and then the other buyer buying the rest over three years.  He has been perpetually late, and I am unclear if taking him to court makes sense, or waiting it out as the payments trickle in.  Make sure you have clauses which indicate what happens on late payments.  It sounds like this structure is there basically, not sure if you are unhappy were they to pay you $2M early.  Sounds like a fine deal to me.<p>I would recommend getting to know your buyers and their history.  In the second startup I sold they were very motivated to pay me because they did not want to scuttle a round of investments.  If you have good contracts and they start waffling on payments and you know they are trying to keep their nose clean at that moment that can be an additional motivator to following through on paying you.<p>Always a great idea to have a second buyer.  Even if you have to make them up.  Said a different way, look around and see who else would want what you have, and give them an opportunity to get in on the bidding.<p>Good luck!",1319591016

They might even be able to license much of the exact same technology as Apple did when they bought Siri the company.<p>My complaint with the quotes and blog post is somewhat different. They both seem to claim Siri will revolutionize search. But Siri isn't about search at all, it's about taking spoken words and turning them into an appropriate text based search query. It still relies on databases and search engines to do the actual searching. At most, it can add a bit of extra context to the query that you might not be able to infer from the text alone. It also represents a unified interface to several domain specific databases. If anything, Siri is a <i>complementing interface</i> to existing search technologies. Buying a bunch of databases won't let Apple solve the problem of search.",1319590920

When updates come in, write them directly to the cache, re-sort the cache as necessary, and then have the database updates run in the background.<p>For the cache tree model I use something like:<p>{'root_comment_id':123,'children_sorted_by_points':[]}<p>Cache expiration left as an exercise for you.<p>This can very easily handle something the size of hacker news.<p>edit: And this easily handles ""many reads and many writes and an ever-changing order"".",1205679258

138169,comment,137802,137965,0,0,thorax,,,"Do you have references for ""nothing even approaches""? Specifically compared to Sphinx? The only comparisons I've found are showing sphinx coming ahead in many indexing/search cases (if only slightly). See my other comment on this thread with links to benchmarks where sphinx clearly ""comes close"". We did a good bit of research on this, so it does feel odd that you'd say ""nothing even approaches"".<p>It was also ridiculously easy to get Sphinx up and going. Lucene is a killer engine, no doubt, but Sphinx's ROI alone won us over.",1205677645

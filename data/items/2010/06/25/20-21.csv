1462118,comment,1461189,1461776,0,0,nooneelse,,,"Good point, but that can also be seen as simply moving some things that might be naïvely thought of as ""non-functional"" into a class of ""not obviously so, but yes, functional"".  The same as with skeuomorphs that are used as social signals.  So even being liberal in letting things into that class, there is very likely a residue of entirely non-functional skeuomorphs remaining, right?  And, I wonder how much we collectively waste on it.<p>Perhaps more interesting, I wonder how that value changes over time in cultures.  Is it ever a significant drag on older cultures after a while?  Does it have secondary effects.  Like if you are surrounded by skeuomorphs all the time, does it hamper some learning because the designs of most things aren't really making sense.",1277499415

A paid iPhone app in the #1 slot for a month can get more than a million downloads in that month. Now think about how many downloads a #1 or #10 paid Android app can get in one month.</i>",1277499372

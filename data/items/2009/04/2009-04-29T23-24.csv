I get that some things are hard to put into words, the grand canyon, a view of the rockies at sundown, a volcanic eruptions, but this car? Its timeless and modern? That is just lazy writing that makes designers look bad. Also, its not really that original. The front end looks like and Aston Martin. The rest looks like a basic sedan. The Audi TT, The Lamborghini, Porches, etc. all have a distinct look this could be confused with 25 other cars.<p>Also, enough puffery. 11 designers working for 8 months is unreasonable? Maybe that is what gets car companies in trouble.<p>Again the technology is cool, the car is not bad, but this terrible writing and overbearing ego is distasteful and unwarranted.<p>Jason, Thanks for posting this, even though I don't like the narrator I enjoy how this adds to the richness of the community.",1241049417

All the traders I have met in my life loathed investment bankers, so calling them <i>bankers</i> is the surest way to infuriate them.<p>Like you said, in the old days, banks did not do trading. Back then, everyone who worked at a bank worked in banking indeed. These days, banks do everything. In fact, a few years ago Goldman Sachs was generating most of its revenue via trading, not via investment banking deals. Therefore, denoting someone who works at a bank by <i>banker</i> is saying absolutely nothing because the guy could be a banker... or a trader, a broker, a quant, etc etc etc.<p>What I meant when I wrote that traders and bankers are entirely different beasts is that their cultures are totally different, though they might work in the same bank. Traders like to think they're much smarter than bankers, they work less hours, they don't work during the weekends because the market is closed, they cultivate a culture of aggressiveness, and they can be quite rude.

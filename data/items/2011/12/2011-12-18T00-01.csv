I do this for some of the Drupal sites I work on - I setup drush commands that will do intensive calculations like most-related-article and etc to run behind the scenes have the results cached.<p>The best solution would be to improve PHP's memory usage so that the benefits may be had on page loads as well. I suspect (but have little hard evidence) that the size of PHP code and data structures impedes performance as threads and processes get pulled in and out of the CPU.<p>A secondary solution would be to take some of the libraries out there for doing specific operations, like scientific commputing and numerical libraries, and make them available to your code as a PHP extension.

3365502,comment,3363231,3363940,5,0,einhverfr,,,"<i>I am starting to understand the fall of Rome a little better.</i><p>You may not be far off the mark.  See ""The Roman Empire and Its Germanic Peoples"" by Herwig Wolfram.  He points out that the Western Empire (which fell over a thousand years earlier) had a far greater disparity of income than the Eastern Empire, and that this meant they couldn't raise the taxes necessary to defend themselves.  The Eastern Empire spent a third of their budget on their army, and this was more than the Western Empire collected in taxes.  He also points out that this doomed Ostrogothic Italy.<p>However, the thing that's missing from this analysis is that the Senatorial families that Wolfram is talking about as the super-wealthy weren't just family businesses.  They were the equivalent of major corporations of their day.  They were huge profit-seeking enterprises, owning sometimes tens of thousands of slaves and having thousands of freed slaves attached.  Some of these had annual budgets that were as much as a third of what the Western Empire would collect in taxes in the same period.<p>We are headed down the same road, I think.",1324168671

Customers expect handling of exceptional circumstances (the pie is too dry, please replace it), but McDonald's-style preparatory science can help prevent such things (e.g. instead of cooking 12 pies at once, the equipment could cook a pie every few minutes.) I think the biggest problem is customers expecting to give orders in spoken language, but we're having trouble cracking that nut with software (noise, dialects, etc.) Also, there's political backlash for having few (if any) employees.",1324168669

I too have the dozens of domain names for long-abandoned web applications for some idea that I thought was a radical spike of insight at the time.<p>It's a vicious cycle.  I get the idea.  I register the domain name, already imagining a brilliant fully-featured yet astonishingly-easy-to-use product.  I start cranking out code.  But it takes some time.  I realized some problems I thought were easy are harder.  That takes more time.  I realize a certain problem is exceptionally hard and will take me longer than I thought, so I hack together something that works for now.  I realize yet another problem will take me longer than I thought, and a few weeks pass and I begin to feel my web application is just a series of hacks.  If we're using the art analogy, rather than the beautiful and crisp design I envisioned, my canvas is filled with ugly smears and smudges that doesn't look anything like what's in my mind.<p>And it's always a lot easier to just throw out the canvas and start something new, than to tediously work out improving those smears and smudges.<p>So, perhaps one hopeful anecdote I can share: earlier this year I did start a project that I've finally been able to focus on.  The only difference with this one vs. the others 
is that I saw a tangible return relatively early on.  Two months after I worked on it, I made $72.  That's basically a laughable number, except it's the first tangible return on the dozens of web applications I've started and abandoned for the past 5 years.  From then on, there's been a mostly-positive correlation between ""hours put into project"" and ""dollars earned,"" which has completely shifted my mentality.<p>I've begun to take pride in those smears and smudges, knowing I'm already succeeding to some degree and it could be especially rewarding if I continue.  I have no idea if this would work for you, or anyone else, but like others have said, this is a process.  Everyone designs and creates at their own pace, and age seemed pretty meaningless to me.  In fact it's now that I'm older, instead of 5 years ago, that I can begin to appreciate my limitations and have the patience to work with them, instead of ignoring the fact that they exist.<p>And above all, be proud that in a world where many are content to maintain and manage (literally and figuratively), you have the desire and the ability to create and produce.

This was because collecting data was so expensive/difficult that only a few images could be captured for many experiments, and the methods they came up with often worked okay for those examples, <i>but nothing else</i>! So a lot of clever-seeming algorithms end up being rather useless in the real world, and progress was illusionary.<p>I find that in computer vision (my area of research), a fundamental component of many disparate problems is that you are trying to interpolate or extrapolate data in a very complicated underlying space, where linear approximations are completely unusable and optimization is too unconstrained. The key is to come up with suitable regularizers that can use prior information to constrain the problem appropriately.<p>Getting more data thus helps in two ways:<p>1. It reduces the amount of interpolation you have to do, since you can get a denser sampling of the space.<p>2. It allows you up to build up these priors using real data, making interpolation much better.",1324167019

One is the concept of ""zero-shot learning"": automatically recognizing an object that you've <i>never seen an instance of before</i> simply via a description. For example, one could recognize beavers as ""small, four-legged furry rodents with big teeth and a flat tail"", without having ever seen a beaver before. The training data for this classifier need not include beavers, but only images which match the individual attributes, not necessarily all in the same image -- small, four-legged, furry, rodent, big teeth, flat tail.<p>This kind of thing was not really possible before, because there just wasn't enough data to train reliable classifiers for each attribute in any kind of automated way.<p>Finally, as I alluded to at the beginning, these individual attribute classifiers are often relatively simple algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Yet, the 2nd-stage algorithms that use the attribute values to do something useful, such as the zero-shot learning application described above, are often much more involved/advanced techniques.",1324166444

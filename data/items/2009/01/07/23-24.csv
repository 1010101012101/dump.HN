I'm taking a much closer look at the most recent release of Tk (8.5). Given recent developments, it doesn't seem to be as ""vestigial"" as I'd thought.

424181,comment,423099,423821,0,0,lionhearted,,,"It's fair - a bit more expensive than you could get doing it yourself. I think if you shop around, you can 2.2% for Visa/MC and 20 cents per transaction even with no credit or volume. The question if it's worth it is how do they handle refunds, cancellations, and most especially - expired credit cards. In a monthly service, you might lose more to expiring CC's than to cancellations! People's cards go over their limit, get canceled, or simply expire. I was surprised when I started seeing monthly credit card attrition numbers, it can brutal.<p>So if Amazon lets customers cancel without you/your support team doing anything, that's valuable. If they let you offer ""no questions asked refunds"" where the customer can get it themself - that might be valuable. And biggest of all - if you can define an automatic process for dead CC's, that'd be <i>really</i> valuable. If Amazon would check if a CC verified, then automatically try again right away if it didn't, then again the next day and day after, then sent a series of 3 emails - if they offered something like that, that'd be phenomenal. I'm going to doubt they do though...<p>So their prices - competitive enough. You'll want to make sure you're not held hostage to them once you start using them, which I suspect you are. And does someone need an Amazon account to sign up? Big question there. Depending on what value they add, they might be worth using. But only if they don't hold your customer data hostage if you want to leave as you grow.",1231372140

However, the major one that I don't see any way around is that the business model is unrelated to the core competency/value/activity of the company. That's a problem almost inherent in advertising though not quite.<p>The classifieds just piggybacked onto newspapers because they had a distribution mechanism & the could make the network effects happen. It never had anything to do with news. There was a symbiosis, but it was an incidental one. You can't just counter that with 'Democracy needs News.'<p>Consider a possible parallel. Imagine T shirts where a major ad industry. Various brands are able to sell cool T shirts that are very fashionable & desired. They sell em cheap & make it up on ads bought by the highest bidder. This becomes a cultural norm. Everyone wears these $2 shirts that would otherwise cost $50 & everyone gets a handful every month.<p>Now say no one wants to buy the ads any more or say the fashion becomes put a sticker over the ad or say atheist buses & neon building become so common that advertising is devalued. Whatever. Can't sell the ads any more. OK. Well, people will buy less shirts. It was nice while it lasted. We had $2 shirts. But that's it. No way around it.

Otherwise, what is the meaning of using a string as an explanatory variable in a regression?<p>If you want to merge data frames that were created w/ different factors, perhaps the easiest thing to do is turn your factors into strings?<p>If d is your data frame, then:<p>d$factorVar <- as.character( d$factorVar )<p>merge your two data frames, then<p>merged$factorVar <- as.factor( merged$factorVar )<p>should set you right...<p>earl",1231369583

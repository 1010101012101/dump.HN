I found, even with the cheap camera I had at the time, that putting it on a tripod, and aiming it down at the table, and zooming in the appropriate amount let me take really stellar shots.   Many cameras these days come with IR remotes so you can trigger them without touching them (important so you avoid messing up the shot during animation.)<p>I wonder, though, wouldn't it be easier to do something like this and get better results using a program like Motion? (part of the final cut suite.)  I've never used a motion graphics program before, but Motion costs $50, and that's within my budget!",1318237135

Developer usability is tightly coupled with the development tools the developer can use, not just with abstract language features. And especially for web development, you can't think only about top of class developers.<p>As I'm at it, I'll write here my dream feature of any language and IDE - not knowing if it is really feasible, but it doesn't look really impossible to me. Use case:<p>- You run your unit tests<p>- An assertion fails/there is an error<p>- A debugger brings you to where the problem is<p>- You can <i>step back</i> from where you are, make changes on the fly to your code and the tests, and <i>step forward</i> to the assertion/error again.<p>I guess that with a VM, and excluding some operations that depend from external status and which are destructive, this could be possible, and it could allow an incredible speedup in development...",1318237071

The 4% doesn't really surprise me at all.<p>2) My observation is that women tend to be on a timeline about 5 years ""faster"" than men because of their biological clock.  As in, they'll start thinking seriously of marriage and kids late 20's, early 30's whereas men will deal with this issue more like early to mid 30's.  So their window for doing a startup is smaller.<p>3) This is a bit of a generalization, but the dynamics are really different when you have all-guy co-founders versus mixed versus all-female co-founders.  With mixed sometimes personal relationships develop which can make things messy.  And when you have a couple of alpha-females together, sometimes that can also lead to problems (for example, see the all-female startup in the TechStars Reality show).

I've found that my code is much more reusable, far less prone to `this` bugs, easier to reason about, etc. I used to be a huuuge OOP guy, but now I rarely find a use for classes...",1318233673

But the sad fact is, I have so far been unable to provide my non-technical friends and family with blogs. Tumblr (maybe the best bet) turned out to be too slow and erratic when I evaluated their interface, blogger is ugly and has mandatory Blogger-Branding (I think), and Wordpress.com has intransparent pricing (I can't figure out how much they cost from their homepage). Furthermore, Wordpress is based on PHP - I could never figure out how to properly host multiple WP blogs on my debian server, and in general I don't trust PHP so hosting it myself makes me feel very uneasy.<p>For those reasons I plan to migrate my blogs to Octopress/Jekyll, which is of course not an option for non-techie people. But it made me think, maybe a similarly clean interface could be presented to non-techies anyway (kind of like Jekyll without the command line). The problem with existing blog engines seems to be that they are overloaded with Ajax and features.",1318233604

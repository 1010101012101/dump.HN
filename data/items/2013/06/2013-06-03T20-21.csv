5815969,comment,5813776,5813776,17,0,scarmig,,,"I find the article rather convincing: I want to play a related alterna-history game that takes the article as a given.<p>Did the Soviet Union make a serious strategic error in declaring war against Japan when it did?<p>Remember, we're taking it as a given that Japan surrendered to the Allies because of the Soviet Union. Moreover, it surrendered to the USA because it for very good reason preferred USA reconstruction to USSR reconstruction, in a way that mirrors whom German troops very strongly preferred to surrender to.<p>What if, instead, the USSR had simply decided to bide its time?<p>Some results:<p>1) Two rivals would continue to claw at each other for months, draining massive amounts of blood and treasure.<p>2) In the meantime, the Allies would be forced to have at least some number of fewer troops in Europe than they did in actuality. I don't find it plausible that the Soviet Union would see it in their interests to, say, invade France and Italy. But it would give the Soviet Union a much stronger negotiating position, and a United States devoting its resources to crushing Japan would be a United States not focused on rebuilding Europe. And a vacuum of power in the more developed parts of Europe would have been very tasty for Stalin.<p>3) On the con side, the USA would likely end up in a more powerful position in East Asia, if it won, decreasing Communist influence from China to Indonesia and Vietnam to India.<p>3.5) If the USA lost (let's define that as the cessation of hostilities while Japan managed to hold on to many of it's earlier imperial acquisitions), the USSR would have an embittered, genocidal, and highly authoritarian state with the capacity for total war on its border.<p>4) Also on the con side, Soviet influence would have been quite limited in Manchuria and northern Korea. The main base of operations for Mao in the Chinese Civil War would have been limited.<p>5) The USSR wouldn't have regained some positions in the Far East that it imagined were legitimately Russian. It also wouldn't have been able to uproot the large amount of industry that the Japanese had invested in Manchukuo.<p>6) Violating the Potsdam agreement that required the USSR to invade by August 9 would have decreased trust in the Soviet Union on the American side.<p>7) All those cons acknowledged, all of them except 6) could have been mitigated by the Soviet Union dragging its feet for six months or even a year more, drawing out and sabotaging back channel negotiations with Japan as much as possible, and then invading at the very end.<p>7.5) If it waited longer, Japan's willingness to surrender might have evaporated, leaving more time to get a full scale invasion of the whole of Korea, northern Japan, and a wider area of China going. That's on top of allowing for more preparation time, which may or may not have been useful.<p>Thoughts, HN? If anything, I think this indicates that the Soviet entering when it did wasn't the main factor that ended the war, because from the Soviet strategic perspective dragging the war out as much as possible seems very preferable to what ended up happening.",1370292971

I'm guilty of this a bit myself. Ada had a DoD mandate in the 90s which really riled a lot of folks and put them off of the language for good. It's part of the reason Ada has not had more of an impact in our lives. That, and compilers for Ada were much more expensive then as well. For many many years though we've had GNAT, a free software project and GCC frontend.

There are some definite limits on what they can do, though I'm not sure where to put those limits, but for the most part, give them experience in actually handling the budget for a heterogenous group that exceeds their Dunbar's number. That experience includes consequences. I'd absolutely expect to see dictatorships, rebellions, and anarchies all arise without adult input, too.<p>Of course, this will never happen, since there isn't any such money available. I actually wonder if it'd be feasible to get someone wealthy do just donate a chunk down at some primary schools in order to try it out.",1370292597

You aren't. Quality time is true for family, and friend hours as well; just because you are there does not mean you are there.  Many people who saw their parents regularly still feel they were very distant from them. If you are at home, be there mentally. If you are working, close that email window, and work.<p>Secondly make more time by waking up earlier in the day. If you wake up at 6, you can go to bed at 10:45, and that leaves you with 16 hours to do your magic.<p>Thirdly, stop being reactionary. If you have a plan other than the no-plan plan (translation ""i don't know what to do so I am doing anything that comes to mind""), then you will know you can execute on it without having to spend 16 hours on it daily. While it is entirely understandable to work extremely long hours every now and then, it is probably more viable over the long term to have a plan and execute on it at your own pace. The things we will change the course of our startup (e.g. ""we have to launch before July 7th"") won't change them at all, besides if your startup is one event away from failure, even if it is Google launching a similar product, then it is safe to say it should not be called a business.<p>Kick back.

I would say that it is less about people's minds working differently than it is about having different belief systems.<p>For example, there are a lot of people that grew up learning the belief that long lines are bad programming practice.  And that's how they see the world.<p>Often what happens is that technologies evolve but our beliefs do not.  This is one example: it used to be very hard to manage editing code with long lines, simply because editors did not have scroll bars.  In that case, it was bad practice.<p>However, modern editors have scroll bars.<p>Now, on to something a little more controversial:  it is a near-universal belief that programming must be authored in a textual language, otherwise it isn't programming, or cannot be effective.<p>I believe that this is another belief that has become outdated.  In fact, I believe that source code is the number one thing holding back software development.<p>Source code is not a structured data format.  It is a textual format where the presentation and data and together. HTML and CSS separate the presentation (CSS) from the structure data (HTML).<p>I actually believe that building web pages and web applications by manually coding HTML and CSS, even though that is what I do since everyone does it and it is practical given current tools and belief systems, is very stupid and based on outdated beliefs.<p>Back when we started programming, we didn't used to have graphical user interfaces at all.

Because almost no one pays that. Why?<p>- In California, MediCal (state-wide health insurance safety net) pays about 20% of the cost (not price) of treatment for those without insurance. So if a surgery costs $10k, MediCal says ""Here's your $2k. That's all you get.""<p>- Nationwide, Medicare pays something closer to 90%. Much better, but still a loss to the hospitals.<p>- Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals, but (from what I've heard) generally pay 115-125% of the cost, giving hospitals a 15-25% margin. Certainly better, but not necessarily making up for the above.<p>- Some patients with no insurance, especially at major academic medical centers, are rich folks looking trying to get the best care in the world for something particularly complicated. UCSF in my neighborhood even has an in-house Saudi liaison for Saudi royals. These folks pay the full rate, which may represent an enormous markup, which does help subsidize the care of the top two categories.<p>For those without insurance, who don't have the money to pay the full fare (meaning you're not a foreign prince or similar), you're going to get freaked out by the bill, which is based on the last category. But in reality, the moment you ask a billing person about the costs, you'll almost always get knocked down into the insurance rate tier, just for asking. Show proof that you have next to nothing, and you could get well down into MediCal levels.<p>In order to get the ultra-rich to subsidize the patients that generate the loss, the price card needs to be high. Really high. So they give breaks to everyone else, since you can't do it the other way -- ""Oh, you look rich, so we're going to charge you double the rate sheet.""<p>This doesn't happen in community hospitals quite as dramatically, since they don't have the ability to handle the crazy conditions that will result in the high-revenue customers. So their rack rate for an ACL will be at the low end, while the academic medical centers that offer the $2MM neurosurgery will have rack rates for every procedure on the high end.<p>Is it messed up? Sure. But does it mean that normal people are paying $65k for this ACL procedure? Usually not.",1370291637

The interactivity and selectivity in receiving said content is inherent to the protocol, and by all means what makes it different from other mass media. You can't deny users the ability to ""receive"" whatever part of the content you want unless you are willing to deliver it in another, more intrusive way.

There's probably a large discrepancy there.<p>My own thoughts are that if there were a true free market for healthcare, with insurance only for real medical emergencies, the costs of a lot of these services would drop, including physician fees, equipment etc. Most of the population would not, and likely could not, pay 68,000 for an ACL repair, which would leave medical providers the option of 1) lowering prices substantially or 2) being out of work. Having put ourselves on high deductible health plans, we are super vigilant now about how we spend our healthcare dollars. And having realized the impact of this, since we are medical providers ourselves, we are now transitioning to a model where we are not participating with many insurance plans, but our fees will be completely transparent - published online -  and fairly reasonable (I think).",1370290738

You might make a piece of software and sell a moderate amount to make a decent amount of money, but your chances of becoming a multi-millionaire is less than 0.3%. So, taking a job gives you the financial stability that you'll enjoy when you have a wife and chidren and health problems. If you are young and have none of those things, go for it - build a product, make a startup. I think the best advice to give a college student is: Invest in your company's 401k if they offer one, put in at a minimum the maximum amount that will be matched, and live frugally. It would also help, if you are getting a BS in software, that you invest your 401k in software companies, since that's your field of expertise, and you want to remain employed, don't you?",1370290501

Of course It was there before opposing governments, even when republic was founded.  There is no way of getting rid of it.

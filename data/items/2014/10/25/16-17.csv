Operator precedence grammars are surprisingly powerful and pretty simple to write (you can write a working parser in ~100 lines of Python or JavaScript, including support for multifix).<p>I did simplify the AST further than XL and added a few invariants. I have 3 leafs (literal, symbol, void) and 3 inner (send, multi, data). The inners roughly work like this:<p><pre><code>    f x             (send f x)\n    [x]             x\n    [x, y, ...]     (multi x y ...)\n    {x, y, ...}     (data x y ...)\n    a + b           (send + (data a b))\n    + a             (send + (data (void) a))\n    a +             (send + (data a (void)))\n</code></pre>\n[] serve as grouping brackets and are therefore purposefully erased from the parse tree if they only contain one expression. Prefix/postfix operators are interpreted as infix operators that have a blank operand on either side. Infix operators are themselves reduced to send/data, so &quot;a + b&quot; is equivalent to &quot;[+]{a, b}&quot;. I find that a bit more robust and easier to manipulate generically.",1414255594

Sure, you can bring up tax loopholes and inequality but generally it&#x27;s true that the remaining capital is after taxes.  So an investor risks losing 100% of their after-tax money.

By the paper&#x27;s feature-based approach, Parsoid would be &#x27;compliant&#x27; with the PHP parser.<p>There is more to compliance than a simple feature comparison though, most of which can only be identified by large-scale testing. Each night, we have been running tests on a sample of 160k articles from 16 languages to check our progress.  In this test setup, 99.99995% of articles round-trip perfectly from wikitext to HTML and back. Currently the focus is on visual diffing to identify remaining rendering differences.<p>There is still a good amount of work left until Parsoid is ready to replace the PHP parser, but most of this is actually not relevant to you if all you&#x27;d like to do is extract semantic information.<p>Regarding the paper: The authors correctly describe some of the issues inherent in wikitext parsing. Its conclusions are however based on strong assumptions about the implementation strategy. For example, they do not consider the option of flattening a PEG parse tree back to tokens in order to implement context-sensitive and generally unbalanced parts of the syntax. Similarly, the analysis of the parsing complexity seems to assume a lack of transclusion limits.",1414255149

There are two main sources. The first is selling goods (books, etc) and services (Amazon Web Services, etc). The second is investors. Amazon owns a lot of it&#x27;s own stock and if it wanted, it could sell that stock to get more cash.<p>3) Who invests? Lots of individuals and groups.

The scientific claims specifically mention a very high intensity workout that most people actually cannot reach. You need to train to get to the level where 7 minute workout makes sense for you.<p>&quot;Research has demonstrated that improvements can be made in VO2max and insulin sensitivity in as little as 4 minutes of total exercise time in an HICT session. However, it is to be noted that this result often requires working at intensities equivalent to greater than 100% of VO2max. Because most individuals may not be able to execute the program at an intensity significantly greater than 100% of their VO2max, following the established ACSM guidelines for high-intensity exercise of at least 20 minutes is recommended. This may require multiple repetitions (or circuits) of a multistation exercise circuit.&quot;\n<a href=""http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/050...</a>",1414253523

There is a growing creative class who were not mechanical enough to get into college, but are smart enough to channel their efforts to the arts, entertainment, literature and entrepreneurship. I think this is only true in big cities though, as I have a hard time imagining country folk being very hip at all.  But who knows.  <p>I'll give an example: my cousin is 17 and lives in Beijing.  He's exceedingly intelligent but hates schoolwork.  He knows more rappers (in the US) than I do and knows NBA scores before I do (I live in the US, I should clarify).  He wants to attend college, but knows it's very difficult, but has backup plans as he's already making decent money as a web developer by day and a DJ by night. <p>Sure, ""they instill in you ..."" blah blah blah, but I get the sense that there's a strong undercurrent creative subculture emerging and we're going to see a lot of results come from that in the future in the form of movies, arts, music and, of course, startups.

Well, that's only if the 3 guys +/- iguana have spent the better part of the last few years learning Python + Django/RoR, MySQL or PostGres setup installation and administration, Unix administration, SSH, Apache/Lighttpd/Nginx configuration and administration, Memcached, Perlbal or Pound, Mongrel, and perhaps Amazon web services like EC2 and S3.  <p>Really, if you're not proficient or able to quickly learn  these technologies, good luck with your iguana.<p>And, after spending the majority of the semester dealing with nightmares associated with the ""Enterprise"" web stack--ASP.NET, J2EE and Oracle--creating a web application is muck.  Why else is Big Co. willing to shell out millions of dollars for a startup that has created these web apps and succeeded in attracting customers?  Because Big Co's aren't doing it well at all.  They're mired in muck.<p>Hackers willing to learn and use a non-Enterprisey web stack will find that they can walk on top of that muck and find brass.  Selling shrink-wrapped software isn't the only way to make money.  ",1196937866

Sacrificing a CPU to the Sun Microsystem gods...",,"So, I thought I'd inaugurate RANT YC!  <p>Allow me to start by blowing off a little steam about my techno-angst, and hopefully get a little ""I feelz ya, Dawg"" from my fellow hacker/founder peeps.<p><RANT>I'm taking a survey of Web development technologies class.  And, we're in the middle of our final project:  \nSet up and configure a Java development environment based on J2EE and J2SE on a Windows system, Set up and configure a 3 tier system using Apache+Tomcat and Oracle Modify a JSP, Servelet and an applet that connect to an existing Oracle database and do some simple querying and updating of a table.  <p>So, all in all, I spent a good two days just trying to get the setup correct, and that's with step by step setup instructions.  I went so far as to do a clean install of Server 2003, install the appropriate JDK's for J2EE and J2SE, configured Eclipse, and then set up Tomcat and Oracle.  It was a freakin nightmare.  Hours upon hours spent getting the Classpath configured correctly for both J2EE and J2SE (they install to different folders, one to c:\Program Files\J2SE... and C:\Sun\.)  Or, wanting to put my foot through my monitor in frustration, because I'm trying get a servelet to simply run on my server.  I spent hours trying to decipher opaque error messages in Java only to find out that my version of Tomcat didn't work with my particular JRE.  So, I had to compile my servelets with a -target 1.5 flag, otherwise, they would crash. Sigh...<p>I'm doing this on Windows for crying out loud.  Why do I have to sacrifice a virgin CPU to the Sun Microsystems gods and do incantations over my OS just to get a friggin development environment right?  Hasn't Sun heard of an installer?  Isnt' that what they are supposed to do for you?  Configure things?  Why do I have to go in to my environment variables and set up my classpath by hand?  Why doesn't the installer do that for me?  And, why do I have to manually configure two separate .java.policy files and make sure that they are the same, before I can run a friggin database applet on my dev box?<p>I went through similar things to update my JRE for Firefox on an Ubuntu box last year.  Hours on hours of downloading, extracting to folders, only to find out that Firefox and Sun don't like each other on Ubuntu much.  I was never able to get it to work.  <p>Why, oh why is Java so popular?  I don't get it.  I thought that Enterprise was about making money.  All this time spent installing and twiddling with Java on a dev box and on a server is just money down the toilet as far as I'm concerned.  I'm planning on founding my startup next summer when I'm done with school.  And, while I've rather enjoyed this class, one of the biggest things it's taught me is this:  Stay away from Java.  It's black death for a startup.<p>And, can I just say that the next time I see anyone on the development crew for either Django or Rails, I'm going to give them a big ole hug.</RANT>\n",1196936347

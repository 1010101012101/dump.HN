As the total brightness of your room increases, matte screens diffuse all of it evenly, eliminating reflections but also losing contrast ratio.<p>As the total ambient light increases, your screen's contrast ratio can drop from 800:1 to 50:1 (or worse). Any contrast ratio lower than about 300:1 can cause eye strain.<p>End result: with a typical screen of about 200cd/m^2 a matte coating is totally unusable if your room is brighter than about 1000 lux but falls below 300:1 contrast around 450 lux (typical office lux is between 350 and 500).<p>In summary... you need to know your environment. Matte screens work great in dark rooms with lots of spot lights to cause reflections. Glossy screens work great in bright ambient conditions with even lighting. Semi matte works well if you need a balance.",1350795123

There are three main advantages:<p>* There is no connection session, so you can close your laptop or put it to sleep and open it up again and the connection will still be there.<p>* You don't have the lag of sending and then responding, it appears locally immediately<p>* It is much easier to get UDP around firewalls and it can't be blocked easily in the same way most VPN protocols or SSH can. I have yet to find a network where I can't get my terminal UDP packets through.<p>The alternative to Mosh is setting up OpenVPN[1]. It is especially worthwhile if you have a network of public servers that you administer. It is easy to setup[2] and works on Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD etc.<p>The best tip is to add a second interface to all your machines and setup a private VLAN across them. This way if you are experiencing a DoS attack or high traffic you can still login and administer the machine (this also applies with standard ssh - you put it in a different range of IPs and on your public machines then only have 80 and 443 open).<p>EC2[3], Linode[4] et al all support adding a second network interface to each machine (or to just one of the machines, which is then used as a gateway to the remainder) which can be assigned an IP address in a different range. You then setup a separate hostname to this network, or even register a separate administrative domain name (eg. company-admin.com) which you keep on a different registrar, whois record, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://openvpn.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openvpn.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/07/multiple-ip-addresses-for-ec2-instances-in-a-virtual-private-cloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/07/multiple-ip-addresses-for...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/Multiple_IPs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linode.com/wiki/index.php/Multiple_IPs</a>",1350795077

This might superficially appear to support his conclusions but it doesn't if you think about it.  If ESPN rises but other things fall in price and I lose a few things I virtually never watch, and my overall bill is lower - which it will be on average if the total spend is down - then I don't CARE that ESPN is $20 per month instead of $5.<p>What will happen is called a market!<p>We'll have a marketplace for content.  There will be a certain amount that people are prepared to spend on content, and how much surplus attention they're prepared to pay for ads which will subsidize content.  The allocation of these resources will be made more efficient by a more efficient market dynamic.  We'll invest more in things we value, less in things we don't.  So the BBC and NFL Network will make money out of me for Dr. Who and the football season.  But I'll no longer be squandering monthly bills in shit I never watch.<p>Plus as content moves to apps on TV the playing field is leveled for independent producers to rise up and the barriers to entry will be much lower than they are today for a show to garner - or KEEP - an audience and revenue stream large enough to sustain it.<p>Imagine if Firefly had been able to say: Fox has bailed on us, but if we can get a million of you to pay just $20 a year we can keep it on the air and send you a copy of the season on DVD after it's over... or something to that effect.<p>This article is garbage.

To the contrary, it recognizes that always placing the interests of authors above those of the public would do the public intolerable harm, and that the author is going to have to live with a less-than perfectly controlled market if he wants any control at all. What the author of a desirable work CAN expect is that there will be a reasonable volume of exchanges in which unavoidable obligations to pay do arise. Based on these he (or, more likely, his publisher) can invest in production accordingly.<p>If your copies and exchanges take place outside this range, then there's no way for the publisher to claim he's being unreasonably harmed by them, since the law gave him no reason to expect that he'd profit from these transactions in the first place.

The first site I mentioned leans towards LinkedIn.

If you have something like dailycred not working, you might need to reconsider how you're structuring your data.<p>The typical implementation pattern is to have User objects (like you'd have if they performed a native auth), and various authentication types that all resolve into the singular User object.  Users can authenticate via whatever they want, but only one 'account' exists for them, such that you can attach multiple authentication providers to the same user.

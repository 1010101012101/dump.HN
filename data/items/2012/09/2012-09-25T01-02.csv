The point of trolling is to fool the target into investing time and emotion into responding seriously.  Insincerity is the defining aspect of trolling, and seeing the victim's response is how the troll gets his kicks.  What the asshole kid in this story was definitely stalking, but it wasn't trolling unless he <i>posed</i> as an antisemitic hate-filled stalker for the malicious fun of watching the victim react.  Unlikely.  Honestly, I think the guy is being way too easy on the kid by calling him a troll.  The kid is a stalker.  The police should have been called, because he's likely to do it again.",1348538320

4568123,comment,4567221,4567221,2,0,gm,,,"Here's a shot at giving constructive feedback rather than bitching about the cost which most people here are doing. Point taken, there's the other stuff I can think of:<p>1) Disclose cost earlier. Telling people to sign up for free and then asking them to pay you is not cool. It starts off the relationship on a bad note and will prevent people from signing up.<p>2) You have a great idea here. Startups need this. We do not have time to set up and configure nagios, or some other warning mechanism. You make a good start by attacking the problem no one else actually wants to take care of, and making it really easy to do so.<p>3) Either forget the hobbyist or make another (less expensive) level of service for him. Do not forget there is very little money to be made on hobbyists unless it is very easy for you to take them on.  You do not want to take on these people asking for the same service for $1 unless you can make it much cheaper to provide service to them.<p>4) As some have noted: Put in a SLA, and tell us why your service will not fail. Otherwise if we are not warned we will not know if it's because your service is down.<p>5) Put up a tutorial or more info on what you offer.  Can we have planned maintenances (ie, do not warn me about this for 4 hours)? Can we hit the snooze button?  What are the methods you use for notifications? How many people/emails/phones will be notified per failure?  The unanswered questions go on and on.<p>6) Do more stuff. What about other type of monitoring? Can we group servers into groups so we do not have to set up each individually? Can we monitor stuff that IS running but I send you a value periodically through the HTTP hit?  I want to graph stuff, like HTTP hits per hour, or HTTPD errors per minute. I want a warning to be sent to me when I get more than X HTTPD errors per minute, for example.<p>EDIT: 7) Add a trial period, this just makes sense.<p>So for work I run Nagios. I would love to have a Nagios set up for my side projects because Nagios provides a world of benefits but if I invested my time in setting up Nagios then I would not have time to do actual development.<p>You are onto something good, you just need to shape it a bit.",1348538298

To quote the lead comment for this thread: ""I definitely feel like Python qua programming language has become a missed opportunity in many ways"".<p>I then provided my experience, as someone who has been developing for over 20 years in numerous languages (even designing them and teaching them in a university setting), of a unique set of challenges and mistakes that I see Python having run across--a perspective that one reader called ""a brilliant if unpopular analysis""--and yet I'm now simply being dragged into the same defensive argument that comes up whenever the 2/3 topic is breached: to turn it into a very personal attack against me and my abilities led by highly inflammatory and insulting wording like ""get this into your head"", quite despite the fact that I am hardly in the minority with regards to these overall opinions.<p>Regardless, I am hereby so confused as to what conversation you feel you are participating in that I am just going to bow out: thank you, regardless, for taking the time to respond.<p>(Oh, I will respond to the semi-unrelated Clojure discussion, as I should probably make certain I don't inadvertently cause them problems: I do not use third-party libraries written in Clojure, as there is really no need given that all of Java is accessible; this already stops most of these problems. Also, the way Clojure 1.3 broke code is closer to the way Ruby 1.9 broke code--a change I stated elsewhere in this thread was a non-issue for the Ruby projects I'm involved in--than the way Python 3 broke code, and was in fact even less of an issue than that.)",1348537818

4568103,comment,4564017,4567803,2,0,dalke,,,"You asked me a specific question. I said that the reason is the lack of resources. I didn't realize that we were talking about the decline and fall of the Python world.<p>I remember reading ""Decline and Fall of the American Programmer."" And ""Rise and Resurrection of the American Programmer."" It's a special kind of consultant who can get paid both coming and going.<p>Python is in decline? How do you reckon that?  In my work, Python is the de factor high-level language for chemical informatics, molecular modeling, structure visualization, and the like. This is much improved over the last 10 years, and won't be dying in as short a time-span as two years in the future. No, most projects haven't migrated to Python 3. Yes, it will be annoying. So was porting client code from IRIX to Linux. That happens.<p>Really, you need to plan for it. And it sounds like you didn't plan for the division operator change. The ideas of that change first surfaced during user testing under the 1.x days, with Alice. That change decision was publicized in spring 2001, with PEP 238. The ""from __future__ import division"" was made available in Python 2.2. The runtime even has the -Q option so you can tell it to print warnings wherever there's a problem. The nice thing about this change is that it's purely a syntax issue which can be handled on a per-module basis, and mixed with modules which weren't compiled this way.<p>These all worked for 2.5, so what was the problem you experienced?<p>What I'm ""defending"" is my sense that Something is Wrong on the Internet. It sounds like you're doing things the wrong way. You expect certain behaviors which were never promised or implied, you don't read the update notices, and you don't use the tools which help you achieve the goals you want. No wonder you get so frustrated with Python! But I don't see what the Python developers could have done better, given the resources they had, and given that they care about goals that do not interest you.<p>You're going to run into the same problems with Clojure. Looking now, it seems that 1.3 broke code. Some things were removed, there were changes to the contrib namespace, and some third-party modules didn't work. Various places say it was a hassle to deal with. Sound familiar? How are you sure something like that will never happen again?",1348537703

This countersuit may help set a clearer precedent for who owns the data posted on public forums and what third party developers should be allowed to do with it.<p>Earlier this year I was searching for an apartment in San Francisco. Craigslist was my only source for places to apply. The good apartments got snatched up pretty fast so I wanted a way to make sure I saw <i>every</i> listing that came through. The problem: there are easily 500 new listings added every day, and approximately 20% of these were re-posts of the same place. It's very difficult and draining, just trying to keep track of what you've already seen and where you left off since the last time you checked.<p>So I did what any self respecting iOS developer would do: I made an app. It worked pretty much like an email inbox. Each new listing was like a new message. Refreshing the feed was like checking your email. Reposts were marked. You could bookmark and store things. The app colored the message cells based on whether they were from the most recent import or not (i.e. the app keeps your place).<p>The best part? It worked pretty damn well. I gave it to a few other people via Test Flight and they were hooked as well.<p>So, again, I did what any self respecting iOS developer would do: I put the app on the App Store. I figured that since my app was exclusively a craigslist client - a tool to make using craigslist better - I might have a better chance of not incurring craigslist's wrath. I put it on sale for $3.99 (it's called Craigslist Commando, if you're curious) and hoped for the best.<p>The app did pretty well given that I did zero promotion for it. It was brining in around $30-40/day after Apple's cut. Unfortunately, my hopes for escaping craigslist's wrath did not pan out. I received a cease and desist letter from them two weeks ago. I'm still waiting on hearing back from them. They've gone silent on me after our initial contact in which they told me to expect a draft licensing agreement. I'm guessing they went silent because they have bigger things on their plate right now. I have opted to keep the app in the store during this time, but I'm not very optimistic that craigslist's licensing terms will be tenable.<p>All of this to say: I have a pony in this race. I respect craiglist's rights to do what they think is necessary to protect their business. However something about this just doesn't jive for me:<p>a) People go to craigslist and create content about some aspect of their lives. They, as the original authors of the content, post it to craiglist <i>with the intention that the general public can see it</i>.<p>b) Other people go to craigslist to view content posted to a public forum in hopes of finding something. This process is frustrating and difficult.<p>c) I create a tool that makes the process of finding something on craigslist less frustrating and difficult.<p>d) Craigslist threatens to sue me for creating the that tool. This despite the fact that I'm helping both: the original authors of the content who would like to have their posts seen by their target audience and, the viewers of the content by making the viewing process more efficient.<p>I suppose craigslist has these <i>rights</i>. But it just doesn't seem <i>right</i>.",1348535588

On a lark, each of us on the spreadsheet testing team implemented a different casino game using spreadsheet macros. This was the old macro system similar to Lotus 1-2-3, with &quot;/&quot; invoking the menu and then using letters representing the hotkeys for each menu command, etc.<p>I took on blackjack, and built a whole Vegas-style game including insurance, doubling down, a configurable number of decks, etc. I was pretty proud of that, what with the self-imposed constraints. But that seems to be small beans compared to this project.<p>The number of bugs that we uncovered during this effort was pretty substantial. For example, we discovered that the PRNG implementation was a lot more P than it was R. We found that when the guy who&#x27;d written the craps game set it up to play automatically overnight, based on some simple heuristics. When we came back the next morning, his robo-player was rich, and we all know that&#x27;s not supposed to happen in a casino. We re-ran the same test the next night, with the same result. It turned out that a quirk had rolls of 11 coming up more often than they should, which is a real problem for craps.<p>Anyway, trying to implement something non-trivial with self-imposed constraints sure isn&#x27;t the most efficient way to accomplish the task, but it&#x27;s a great way to stretch your understanding of a platform.",1449183421

I suspect that it something quite a lot of people who consider to be morally wrong (whether they would consider it the kind of moral wrong that it would be desirable to formally sanction, as through legal prohibition on doing it or legal restriction on public interaction if you do it, is a separate consideration, but consider the issue of mandatory vaccination which involves legal restrictions if you fail to take <i>active</i> steps, involving treatment of your own body, to protect yourself and, through herd immunity, others from communicable disease -- its not implausible that many would consider <i>active</i> steps, even involving modifying your own body, that increase the risk of communicable disease sufficiently to not only be abstractly morally wrong, but the kind of moral wrong for which legal sanction is appropriate.)<p>> We generally consider an action&#x27;s morality based on the intent. If your intent is to spread disease, it&#x27;s wrong. If you had a different intent, but didn&#x27;t realize the consequences you&#x27;re not considered to be wrong.<p>In morality, as in law, while intent is usually important, actions taken without intent to cause harm <i>but</i> in which known risks of harms to others exist and are ignored, or even cases where risks of harm exist which would have been discovered with due care and are unknown to the actor due to their lack of concern, are often <i>also</i> considered wrong despite the absence of specific ill intent.",1449183367

10673346,comment,10662002,10671853,0,0,tzs,,,"Library records were not necessarily all that private.<p>When I was a kid/teen, each book in the county library had a card in a pocket glued or taped to the inside front cover of the book. Your library card had a metal plate on it embossed with your library card number. To check out a book you took it to the checkout counter, they took your library card and the card from the book, and used a machine that printed your library card number and the due date on that card from the book [1]. They kept that card, and put a card in the book that told you the due date.<p>When you returned the book, they would put that original card back in the pocket and return the book the the stacks.<p>Note that if you could obtain my library card number, then you could find out if I had checked out a particular book by simply finding that book on the shelves and looking at the checkout card to see if my library card number was printed on it. You could even tell when I checked it out because the due date would be listed. The card had enough room to store records from a couple dozen checkouts.<p>I think that this didn&#x27;t bother people because it took some work to get the information. First, you need the target&#x27;s library card number. One way you could get that would be to have someone watch me when I come out of the library and try to get a good enough look to identify a book I&#x27;ve checked out. Then wait until I return the book and it is back on the shelves, and you can get my number from the card.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got the card number, you now have to start looking in books for it. If you are trying to see if I&#x27;m reading books on a particular subject, you might reasonably look at all books on that subject, but if you are trying to get a general picture of all my reading that is going to be a big hassle.<p>A lot of things were like this--the data was not particularly protected or kept private, but because getting it required going to some particular place and trolling through printed records generally only people who had a really good reason to want it would go to the effort.<p>[1] Similar to the way credit cards worked back before electronic card readers.",1449183260

10673344,comment,10662407,10673271,0,0,gh02t,,,"Kinda. You can do `task due:today +calendar` to get a printout of stuff that&#x27;s due today and tagged as &quot;calendar&quot; and you can tweak the columns it shows and ordering to show it exactly the way you want. I say &quot;kinda&quot; though because it&#x27;s not exactly the same as a calendar in the sense you can&#x27;t schedule a duration for a task because there is only an idea of &quot;due time&quot;. In my mind, a calendar tracks when an event begins <i>and</i> when it ends. You can create an appointment task that has the due time being the start of the appointment, but I don&#x27;t think you can say &quot;and it lasts until 3PM&quot;.<p>You can in general pre-define custom views with filters that show e.g. only high priority tasks due on the second Thursday of February that are dependencies of other tasks and then define exactly what you want it to show in its printout. It&#x27;s also extensible and scriptable, so you can probably add custom hooks and such to do whatever you like. It also supports arbitrary user-defined attributes for a task, so if you really want to make it into a complete calendar you can add a user attribute to track the end time and then have it in a column of a custom calendar printout and maybe add hooks to prevent overlap or check that times are valid etc.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t use it this way as it&#x27;s just not what I want it for. But it can definitely do it; it&#x27;s ridiculously flexible. Exactly how much calendar-like functionality you want determines how much work it&#x27;d take... ranging from none if you just want to track appointment start times for the day to a chunk of scripting if you really want a full-blown calendar.",1449183252

Avoiding fast food, added sugar beverages, eating organic foods (low in pesticide and higher in nutritional yield) is a huge leap in the right direction.<p>You&#x27;ve also packed a heavy dose of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals from the great veggies, healthy fats (avocado, sunflower seeds - note, not oil!). What&#x27;s more, the salmon is high in EPA and DHA content, further reducing inflammation in the body and promoting the health of so many vital bodily functions. You&#x27;ve even correctly recognized a 1800 calorie daily allowance as being near optimal. It even appears you&#x27;re meeting the World Health Organization&#x27;s recommendation to get at least 55% of calories from carbohydrates and probably getting enough fiber (which only 3% of Americans do!)<p>Now, the bad news - by breakfast time, you&#x27;ve already exceeded the daily recommended intake for cholesterol (300 mg; each egg contains approximately 250 mg). The meats (even if local, wild-caught, or raised &quot;naturally&quot;) most certainly contain questionable levels of persistent organic pollutants, which bioaccumulate at alarming rates in fat-soluble tissue of animals, estrogen, antibiotics, and possibly even harmful bacteria which will upset your gut glora and inflame the liver, colon and kidneys. The cooked steak has a dangerous amount of acrylamide and other carcinogens produced when flesh is cooked at high temperatures. Olive oil is just empty calories - just unnecessary fat with the majority of nutritional benefits destroyed by the extraction process. High amount of sodium from red meat is also known to increase blood pressure and cause insulin resistance. Nitrites and nitrates have also been shown to increase insulin resistance and to impair the function of the pancreatic beta cells. Finally, there is the heme iron found in the meat which is quite damaging if consumed in excess.<p>Now, I really don&#x27;t think you need to worry, especially if your genetics don&#x27;t predispose you to any chronic illness. But, I am of the opinion the outlined meals are not ideal. Maybe you&#x27;re not interested in pursuing a gold nutrition standard each day and at each meal, and that&#x27;s perfectly understandable! However, let&#x27;s agree there is room for improvement, especially if you struggle with BMI, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, mood problems, attention defecit, or other ills, many of which are caused or at least exacerbated by the foods I&#x27;ve recommended avoiding.<p>On a slight tangent, have you used the website, Cronometer?

We do think that Swift is the language that we recommend for new developers to our platform who are investing for the future and building new apps. We think Swift is absolutely the right place to start. But we’ll continue to maintain, advance, and support Objective-C for as far as we can see.”<p>That&#x27;s good to hear.",1449182231

It would depend on whether or not the license says it is irrevocable and whether or not the license is sub-licensable.<p>Let&#x27;s suppose Alice gives Bob a copy of code whose copyright is owned by Charles, and the code was licensed to Alice under and open/free license.<p>If the license is revocable, Charles should be able to revoke the licenses for existing copies, and offer replacements that are more closed. Those who do not accept that replacement license should, I think, be able to continue using the copies they have but they will not have a license. Their rights will be limited to those rights that copyright law gives to owners of legally made copies. For software, that would mean they could use the code, but could not make and distribute copies or derivative works.<p>If the license is irrevocable, then Charles should not be able to take away existing licenses, but he may be able to stop issuing new licenses. That brings is to the issue of sub-licensing. If the license is sub-licensable, then when Alice gives Bob a copy, Alice can also give Bob a license via her sub-licensing right.<p>If the license is not sub-licensable, then Alice cannot give Bob a license. Bob&#x27;s license has to come from Charles. So what happens if before Alice gives Bob a copy, Charles has decided to stop issuing new licenses?<p>I think Alice should still be able to distribute to Bob, because she has a license that allows distribution. Without a license from Charles, though, Bob would only be able to use the code for things copyright allows the owner of a particular legal copy to do without a license, which would be use it himself but would not include making and distributing copies and derivative works.<p>Alice might be able to argue that the terms of her license with Charles require Charles to provide licenses to those whom Alice distributes to, and so perhaps Alice could go to court to force Charles to keep granting licenses.<p>I don&#x27;t recall enough from law school about third party beneficiaries to figure out whether Bob could sue Charles based on Alice&#x27;s license to get a license from Bob for a copy he got from Alice, or whether, if Charles sued Bob for copyright infringement Bob could use Charles&#x27; contractual obligation to Alice in his defense.",1449181880

The way they work is by using a set of lookup tables that are 4k to 16k in size (larger lookup table for larger N). The reason they are fast is because the lookup tables fit within the L1 cache on modern CPUs. So when you do 100M rounds of CRC32 it is super fast because the table is always cache hot, but I don&#x27;t think this result is informative if you just want to occasionally do a CRC in between doing other types of work (especially for small buffer sizes).

In special situations where you are pregnant, the law may cause repercussions to you under certain circumstances. From this, you can assume that you have an unlimited right to self-modification, though you do not have an unlimited right to modify fetuses, which law does not understand as being a part of your self. This right is not explicitly codified anywhere, though we implicitly understand it to be the case, even in extreme cases such as heavily pierced or tattooed people. I am not equating cosmetic actions with genetic modification, but the fundamental right of self modification is the same for both.",1449180902

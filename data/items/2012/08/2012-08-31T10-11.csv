I started messing around with programming when I was a kid and I never learned typing or trained for it formally. When I started, I was just pecking with my index fingers, but since my mom and dad used a typewriter for their stuff, I was fully aware that pecking was suboptimal. They never offered any practical help with that, probably because they knew that I couldn't care less about <i>how</i> I type, as long as I could crank out my code. Long story short: I've developed my own technique, spontaneously. I'm aware that it's probably suboptimal, but it's good enough for me and I can't be bothered to retrain when there's so much more interesting stuff to do ;)",1346410266

Sure WP7 is not that popular yet, but the point is they would <i>want</i> it to be popular as well to have a strong alternative to Android. And at that point they'd be in square one, with a lot of other companies developing devices with identical software, just like in the PC business, which is another market Samsung seems happy to be in.<p>So yeah, I don't buy that argument. Sure they'd prefer if they'd do their own thing, but I'm sure they wouldn't be too mad about if it if all they could use was stock Android (which by the way, they seem to be using in their Galaxy Camera).<p>If Google is the only one making a cross-license with Apple, then that scenario is even more likely, because the deal would obviously cover only Google's own software implementations, and not Samsung's or anybody else's. So then if a company wants legal protection against Apple, they'd have no choice but to use stock Android. Win for them, win for us.

For some C++ programmers they wont or simply <i>can't</i> give up the low level ability to mangle data.

Both own BS patents.<p>Actually, this verdict should have been expected - The court is in the country of the infringer (Apple), The lawyers are from the same country and the money is <i>also</i> from the same country. There is no reason as to why people should support Samsung (Korean) than they should support Apple (in an unfair world).  Apple has easy access to every kind of influence you could think of. This leads us to several conclusions:<p>1) One who has more money in this is system called 'democracy' RULES this system, because they automatically gain all the power they need. Including support from all legal systems and governments.<p>2) If you assumed everything happened in a fair platform, without exchange of money <i>illegally</i>, then your assumptions are plain wrong. Apple has a lot of money..even more than Samsung, it is easier for Apple to payout the necessary guys in the legal system and still not leak it outside to anyone, than it is for Samsung. This is NOT to <i>confirm</i> they bribed someone, but just to let you know that there is a very high probability of them doing so.<p>Why do I think so? Think about this fact: Apple has sued numerous competitors using their BS patents and has won several times. Numerous competitors have sued Apple and none of them have had a fair victory <i>yet</i>. Surely there is something fishy going on here.<p>Also to be noted - Apple has more money than any of their competitors.<p>3) I suspect even Samsung's lawyers could have been manipulated, because they all seem slightly dumb to me (on purpose?).<p>In all its entirety, this whole legal system and patent system is just a clever way for the people involved to make money. Tomorrow, if you plan to start a phone company, just keep all this in mind; You are as vulnerable as Samsung is to get sued for BS reasons by such patent trolls (Apple).<p>A little personal:<p>I wanted to buy a tablet for my mom, I was seriously considering the iPad 2, because it still is a really good tablet. After all this BS, I've decided not to buy any of their products, even though in the end, loss of a single user is not going to matter to them. But I am pretty sure that there is strength in numbers. I sincerely plead everyone to boycott Apple and its products, because if its going to be more than just one user(me), it WILL surely have an impact on them. Hopefully, they will learn not to repeat all this shitty behavior again.<p>A little deeper:<p>Actually, if you are against Apple for such bad behavior, you have no other choice, than to boycott them. A few months back, my idea was to create a better tablet than Apple did and show the world that they aren't the only ones who can do it and they are over-hyped as hell. I contacted Chinese OEM's, display guys, etc. But, later I realized, it will be of no use, because I will be as vulnerable as Samsung was...and I don't even have the money to defend myself or my tablet startup. Hence the only way to screw Apple right now is to stop buying their products.<p>Thanks for reading.",1346408047

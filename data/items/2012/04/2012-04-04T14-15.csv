Specific, concrete examples often take quite a bit longer to express. This came up a lot when I was tutoring CS: it was easy to give a precise but abstract textbook definition of something, but thats not useful at all to a beginnermuch better to say you can use pointers to make a linked list and heres how than pointers are referential types used to implement non-contiguous data structures and to reduce copying.",1333551591

If handguns were outlawed in the US so there was no legal supply chain, where would the criminals get them? They'd need to set up a supply chain from some country with abundant gun supply. Instead, we now have Mexico complaining  about rampant assault rifle flux across the border <i>from</i> the US.<p>If you define the question as ""do most criminals get guns by stealing them from another law-abiding person"", then <i>maybe</i> you're right. But there are many more sources that transfer legal guns to criminals, like: getting guns <i>before</i> becoming a criminal; stealing them from the supply chain (gun shops, manufacturers, etc); getting them through corruption in the supply chain; convincing a legal owner to lend/sell a gun to you, etc.  If you define the question in a broader sense as in ""do the guns most criminals possess come from a legal source inside the US"" then it seems highly likely that's true, and the only reason that availability exists is because the legal supply exists.",1333551243

If it's interesting I'll try to flesh out my idea, but I've noticed that many of my ideas involve user-generated content, where this content is publicly available. I like the idea that you can give users tools and the product grows on its own, with some improvements/fixes when needed. In just simply trying to plan out some of these ideas, I always seem to run into the same problem, that is: how do I stop people from creating offensive content and/or spam. I was wondering if there was any advice from the HN community?<p>Some ideas I've had include: moderating content manually (this doesn't seem feasible though), user review (flagging content, or voting down), force users to use facebook accounts to sign in (this way they may feel less inclined to make such content if they are not anonymous, and making a fake account is a bit of a hassle just to spam).

3797822,comment,3796869,3797047,15,0,ef4,,,"The V8 performance issue with try/catch is widely misunderstood, and it causes people to unnecessarily avoid using it.<p>try/catch can slow down code <i>in the same function as the try/catch statements</i>. But it doesn't slow down any other function called from within there. In other words, it only affects the stack frame at which the try/catch statement actually appears.<p>So if you have some top level error trapping function like:<p><pre><code>    errorCatcher = function(continuation){
      try {
        continuation();
      catch(err){
        reportErrorToServer(err);
      }
    }
</code></pre>
and you only call it once at every entry point to your code, the impact will be totally undetectable, because there's only a single function invocation within the unoptimizable area.<p>I encourage people to performance test the difference caused by try/catch like this. You'll see that it doesn't hurt at all. It's only a problem if you actually write a try statement within some tight inner-loop function.",1333550949

A few other concerns that I have besides inaccuracy are (1) The interface is significantly more cluttered and confusing, and (2) In their decision to auto-generate profiles, rather than wait for authors to create their own, you have a glut of profiles that again are incorrect in the papers that are attributed to them. The chances that a significant number of people are going to go in and curate their profiles seems small, instead of having a limited but accurate collection of profiles, you end of having a majority of incorrect ones.",1333550938

But what exactly do you mean by ""get a feel""?<p>Suppose your CTR is known to be either 0.09% or 0.11%, you've had 10,000 impressions, and you've got 11 clickthroughs. (This is of course the most likely number if your CTR is actually 0.11%.) The likelihood ratio between the two possibilities is about 0.81. So if you thought those two possibilities were equally probable before, you should now think it's about 55% likely that the CTR is 0.11% and about 45% likely that it's 0.09%.<p>So if by ""get an idea"" you mean something much stronger than 55%:45% then I fear you may be fooling yourself, no matter how much you've spent on advertising over the last few years. (Whether that means you should reconsider ""test everything"" depends on the costs of testing -- the actual cost of doing it, and the cost in running something other than the currently-believed-best version.)<p>And with 1000 impressions? Forget it. You expect to see 0.9 clickthroughs on average with a 0.09% CTR and 1.1 on average with a 0.11% CTR.

Static typing might help here, but designing a protocol/interface/api/dsl is hard and I need to experiment a lot with it, so I'm willing to sacrifice some safety for better overall design and flexibility(which will hopefully make debugging easier). IOW I agree you need DSLs, polymorphism and all that good jazz. Where my disagreement comes in is that It's a trade off, and not necessarily an absolute need to have a lot of static typing. In my personal work I'm willing to make the trade off and work with clay rather than marble. Other people work and think differently and I accept that; absolute truths are rare in computer science, and don't exist in software engineering, its all trade-offs here :)<p>ps My hobby vaporware CL project will probably be called mudball, I'm trying to learn how to design systems with hackability and extreme flexibility in mind :)",1333550724

3797789,comment,3795513,3796215,2,0,ssmoot,,,"So you have an easily identified problem to solve.<p>Specification and Responding to Change are not mutually exclusive. You do the first. You get an estimate. When a change is mandated, you specify the change. You estimate it. When you discover a feature was under-specified, you re-specify it.<p>You wouldn't find out your code doesn't work, and then not update the tests. Why would you treat specification any differently?<p>When the 3 month project ends up being a 9 month project, you have clear, actionable documentation on where your process needs fixing, and if the developer truly did hit all their marks, they get their well deserved rewards/kudos despite being saddled with a poorly managed project.<p>There are projects (I'm sure) that are practically impossible to specify well. I've never worked on one though. Web Development is, by it's nature, a rather straight-forward process. The more unpredictable portions (design, data-migration) can be sandboxed in a pragmatic manner.<p>I've been a part of projects that have run very well and satisfied the client despite changes doubling the original project cost. That's what Change Requests are for. To make sure you're all on the same page and everyone knows what they're paying for.<p>The fallacy of Agile for the projects I've worked on is that the clients will be delighted to recieve ""what they want"" if they don't know the ultimate timeline, can't make their own plans around it effectively, and have payed a lump sum of money thinking they were buying X, but instead recieved X--.<p>Since let's be realistic, when you talk about shifting to an ""lean"" process in a fixed-bid environment, you're not talking about delivering a better suited to the needs Y to a client who paid for X. You're talking about delivering a subset of X that fit within the time allowed. And who ever walked away happy when they got less than they paid for?<p>If you take for granted the Perfect Specification is impossible, you don't have to shoot the whole process in the head either. Would it be valuable to spend a few minutes post-design on deciding what Validations apply to the Form fields presented? Or how to map those fields to your data-store? Spend a few minutes thinking about what business-logic applies ""in the background"" once that Form is submitted? What happens on error? What test-cases should be defined to ensure we get the basics covered like HTML escaping, CSRF protection, etc?<p>Even a deliberate attempt to cover half of what you might ultimately need to consider to deliver this feature makes the rest so much easier, more predictable and easier to estimate.<p>The dirty secret is estimates (again, speaking from experience in Web Development) <i>aren't</i> all that difficult. It's just a Garbage-In-Garbage-Out situation. I've been doing this for 10 years. Estimating the time it'll take me to write a Form is not difficult to do accurately. Just like I can't off-the-top-of-my-head estimate the effort involved in writing a Web Framework or O/RM before breaking it down into Routers, Actions, Templates, etc, I can't estimate a Feature without breaking it down into smaller chunks either.<p>The overarching theme in most of the comments to this post is that estimates are hard, impossible or not worth doing. I respectfully disagree on all counts (within the context of web-development anyway, which is all I can speak to here).<p>It certainly doesn't benefit the Developer to have all the accountability and none of the authority when working on an extended project without strong Project Management backing him or her up. So it seems to me pretty self-defeating when instead of figuring out what works and what doesn't, like your average Developer would tackle any other problem, instead the popular opinion seems to veer towards throwing out the baby with the bath-water and absolving oneself of responsibility instead.<p>The Executives are going to blame someone, and it's rarely going to be themselves. At least not in any meaningful way. Like it or not if you're working on a Doomed Project, and you don't have someone to back you up, realistically you're going to be looking at a reevaluation in the capital of your own reputation. Fair or not, that's the way it works in my experience more often than not.",1333550624

The way that you get a police state is by making everything illegal and then doing selective enforcement. That way when organizations that control law enforcement decide they don't like you; the police can arrest you with impunity and just find something to charge you with after the fact.<p>I also find it highly unethical to make things illegal for the sake of being able to slap defendants with another charge at trial. It usually ends up causing collateral damage to legitimate people and services (In the case of general laws like this that put blanket bans on things that shouldn't be blanket banned.), and seems like a lazy excuse to do more legislating.

This hash could be N elements wide for both axes, where N is the # of potential sieves in the box.  Then I would scatter the series so that per-sieve, the longest parts are eradicated/expelled in an early layer.  The expel part happens because the sieves are not laid flat in the box, but staggered/staged in order to utilize gravity.  Around the gravity staging, I would put the N element filters in a way such that the outer edges of the box naturally catch the larger pieces and hold them closer to the layer exit.<p>I guess I should just dump the parts on a scanner and get on with it, but it intrigues me that among the HN crowd, someone might have a much better idea or reason to pursue the electro-mechanical route.",1333550529

Many organizations have been asking for applicants' Facebook credentials to check for indications of misbehavior. Facebook has publicly denounced this and threatened to sue employers who follow this policy.<p>It's odd that despite all this controversy Facebook asks for access to your profile before applying. Now, they do make it clear that it is optional to grant access and that you may send them a resume but I think that this places applicants at a disadvantage. One could argue that this is an example of discrimination by privacy. I imagine applications with and without profiles going to different bins before they are reviewed.<p>So, how is requiring API access to your profile different from asking for your password? Could an employer build a Facebook app for job applicants to authorize? The app would scan the applicant's profile for bad behavior. This would avoid the issue of asking for credentials but may conflict with Facebook's data usage policy. One could imagine, however, a ""job application"" app that algorithmically looks through profiles without revealing personal information to the employer and raises alarms if it finds anything suspicious. It seems people are already familiar with Google's Gmail ad bot reading their email.

The changes were announcing today will put our customers first, allow us to move fast, and to get stuff done.  The outcome of these changes will be a smaller, nimbler, more profitable Yahoo! better equipped to innovate as fast as our customers and our industry require.<p>Over the last 60 days, weve fundamentally re-thought every part of our business and we will continue to actively consider all options that allow Yahoo! to put maximum effort where we can succeed.  As part of this process, I believe we have to focus to win in a select group of core businesses globally:<p>         Core Media and Communications:  Our content, media, and communications experiences must be best in class.  That includes getting todays core properties right and innovating on a next generation of great product experiences across all screens.<p>         Platforms:  We must make our core platforms and systems a genuine strength for Yahoo!  platforms that we can really leverage to support our massive scale, drive the deepest personalization, and boost speed to market.<p>         Data:  Our massive data sets must become a genuine competitive advantage for Yahoo!.  We have to unlock the value in our data to allow us to really understand our 700 million users, encourage and win their engagement and trust, leverage everything they do with us to more fully personalize their experiences, and to give our advertisers the immediate insights they are rightfully demanding.<p>We are intensifying our efforts on our core businesses and redeploying resources to our most urgent priorities.  Our goal is to get back to our core purpose  putting our users and advertisers first  and we are moving aggressively to achieve that goal.<p>Unfortunately, reaching that goal requires the tough decision to eliminate jobs, which means losing colleagues and parting with friends.  Today, we will begin the process of informing employees about these changes. As part of that effort, approximately 2,000 people will be notified of job elimination or a phased transition.  We value our people and for those who will be leaving, we thank you for all you have contributed to Yahoo!.  We will treat all of our people with dignity and respect, providing resources to help manage through their transition.<p>Change is never easy. But the time has come to move Yahoo! forward aggressively with increased focus and accountability.  Our values have always been about treating all Yahoos with dignity and respect, and today is a day to embrace those values.  This is an amazing company with exceptionally talented people and I know we will all do our best to encourage each other through this difficult period of transition.<p>Thompson-Scott.png<p>EDIT: The mail sent to us by our respected CEO Scott Thompson.",1333549786

Using the basic binomial model, if you have two test conditions, one of which actually does 20-25% better than the other, (say, 0.11% versus 0.09%), your confidence intervals will keep overlapping until you have OOM 1M impressions.

Of course there are older computers, but their OS should be using comparably less RAM. WinXP takes up 100 MB at login, so if you only have 1 GB on an older computer, you should still have no problem running modern Firefox. And if you only have 512 MB, it's probably time to upgrade since the web experience that a modern browser can offer you will be crippled by your old hardware.<p>A few months ago I had a conversation with somebody who complained that Firefox used too much memory (about 600 MB). I asked how much he had. He said 3 GB. That seemed more than enough to me, after all Gnome consumes 200-500 MB at login, depending on whether you're using 32 or 64 bit and which shell you're running (Gnome 2, Gnome Shell, Unity, etc). Turns out, Win7 was eating <i>2 GB</i> at login, leaving him with only a gigabyte for other programs.<p>In my view, the operating system is just a platform to launch other stuff. It shouldn't use more than 25% of your memory. If it does, you should either get more RAM or slim down your OS. If his computer obeyed my rubric, he'd have plenty of room for Firefox. His anger was obviously directed at the wrong problem, but for some reason the OS (and all the crapware which loads at boot and runs in the background, even when it's not needed, consuming precious resources) gets a pass.",1333548547

By the time you actually finish the integration of backends to allow for micropayments, tracking users, and equity allotments, you already have users and are that much further ahead of anyone else working on something similar when you turn those features on.<p>YC is awesome, but they only are one of many options available to you.

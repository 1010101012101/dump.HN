I had to jump over so many hoops that it was just a pain.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on a new project (still research phase) where I was pondering going with Spray and a lightweight Postgresql wrapper because I primarily need to read data from a database, do some transformations on it, and write it out as JSON as fast as possible. I had it working in Spray, but I had issues with server crashes and the speed wasn&#x27;t as I&#x27;d have expected. I fiddled with it for one day, and then, out of frustration, decided to give openresty a try. I&#x27;ve never written much Lua in my life, but after only a couple of hours, I had it working, and it was far, far faster than the Spray implementation. I did some research there, and it seems that the database stuff took a whole lot longer in Scala/Spray than in Lua. Now, of course, I loose type safety, so there may be hidden issues in there, but since I&#x27;m really just doing simple data transformations, I think I&#x27;m fine with lua / openresty.<p>As a first verdict, I really, really like what I&#x27;ve seen of Openresty so far.",1383292032

I use MacPorts for package management (which provides sane Python and most everything else I need), and anywhere that fails I can run a VM or just SSH to a box. iTerm is a great terminal, and I use ClipMenu, which is a great clipboard manager. Quicksilver means I rarely need to touch the mouse when I&#x27;m typing.

More importantly though is that OS X gives me access to Photoshop, Lightroom, and OmniGraffle which I wouldn&#x27;t really want to be without. I&#x27;m rarely in XCode these days, but it&#x27;s still useful for knocking out the occasional iOS/OS X code I deal with as well.<p>Basically, OS X gives me a very comfortable environment (I&#x27;ve used Windows and other *Nixes for years in the past), and the best of both worlds for design and dev software.",1383291834

I myself am partial to Linux and being able to manually configure machines just the way I want, both in production and at home.<p>I have an ansible playbook which I use to make sure that my different machines (1 work box running Precise, 1 home box running Saucy, 1 laptop running Precise) are all running the same applications (everything from xchat to vim configs is controller by ansible). Gvim + grep/ag/sed/tmux is all I need for full-stack development. Postgres/Redis/JVM all running on the same machine, as well as Vagrant and an always open connection to our VPN. It&#x27;s pretty nice, I can&#x27;t complain. With vim plugins and the ability to nREPL into my apps, I&#x27;ve yet to miss an IDE once. Keep a personal Wiki for notes and everything interesting in vimwiki. Full support for all the other apps that provide creature comforts such as Skype, Spotify, KeePass, VLC. Quite like GIMP for basic photo editing, plenty of video editing/conversion command line tools like imagemagick and ffmpeg. Audacity for audio. LibreOffice has always worked fine for me, but I&#x27;m not an Office poweruser.<p>Due to time constraints I recently have pretty much stopped playing videogames, which was the last reason for me to keep a copy of Windows around. With Steam pushing hard for Ubuntu gaming, my OS should be more viable in the coming years there as well.<p>Don&#x27;t really see a good reason to ever move to OSX besides maybe sexy hardware (yes you can run Linux on Macs, but I keep reading about the awful driver support). I strongly support the philosophies and vision behind the free and open source software movements and want to exist in that ecosystem as much as possible.

I came from Linux to OS X not too long ago (three years maybe?) and while the first thing I do is install GNU coreutils and findutils, I don&#x27;t find myself having to do much else to make the command-line environment feel very friendly. Most &quot;Linux-only&quot; scripts that I run across are really just &quot;GNU-only&quot; scripts, and work fine. Obvious exceptions are ones that do specifically touch Linux-specific constructs, but I find that most are just not tested with the default BSD tools and suffer for it.<p>My only other beef is that there&#x27;s no rc.d system and OS X&#x27;s startup stuff is messy, but I do that so rarely that it doesn&#x27;t usually come up.<p>The other major advantage for me is Xcode. I did not get-it until Xcode 4, but these days I really miss when I&#x27;m not using it. (I do mobile and web development on the JVM, but I write games on the side.)

Yes, it&#x27;s decentralized and represents a true &quot;gold standard.&quot; Many people agree with this. Society as a whole may benefit from adopting Bitcoin. Regardless of how many argue against this, the fact remains that Bitcoin has widely hypothesized advantages. Whether they represent actual  advantages or not, nobody can know... But at least there exists a set of apparent advantages.<p>But no advantages of Bitcoin represent a clear advantage to individuals. For example, most likely your neighbor sees no advantage to buying a pack of gum with Bitcoin instead of cash or credit. Ironically, he has less incentive, since most Bitcoin holders believe it will increase in value as a currency. So why spend it?<p>A currency cannot succeed without consumers transacting with it. Otherwise, the currency implodes.<p>So why should 90% of consumers choose to transact with Bitcoin? Imagine you are creating an ad for Bitcoin to show to an audience representing a wide cross section of the population. What argument has the highest probability of convincing them to buy Bitcoin with the intention of spending it?",1383290225

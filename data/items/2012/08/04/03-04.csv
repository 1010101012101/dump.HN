It hasn't been an issue previously and won't be an issue in the future.<p>>Their extremely slow iPhone hardware update cycle leaves them vulnerable to fast-evolving competitors and a single bad product will poison the well for years.<p>The update cycle has been in place for a number of generations now and every successive update has been more successful than the last. So this is factually baseless. Also many people like the fact that Apple supports their devices a lot longer than Android OEMs.<p>>The colossal amount of value stored nowadays in a single Apple ID means the damage from a security breach or intrusion is astronomical.<p>No different than if your online banking, Amazon, Google login was compromised. And infinitely more 'value' can be obtained by simply stealing a person's laptop or phone.<p>> Apple has nothing interesting or heartening to say about their law enforcement policies vis a vis the data they collect.<p>No evidence that this is an issue for most people. Telcos you would argue have a longer and deeper history of compliance with federal enforcement agencies and there hasn't been much of a uproar about it.<p>> Stitched leatherette Contacts.<p>Again factually baseless that this has impacted Apple in any way.

If the salesman really wants to sell you the EVO you'll probably end up with the EVO.<p>Of course some people do come in with their heart set on something they or a friend had so I'm sure the brand thing you're talking about is real. I don't think it's the reason for the magnitude of what's being claimed for it here.  Intending to buy a Samsung phone only works if the store is selling Samsung phones and we saw a nice version of this math play out while the iphone was only on AT&T and at 17% US market share.

One of the most striking features of TDL4 is that it is able to load its kernel-mode driver on systems with an enforced kernel-mode code signing policy (64-bit versions of Microsoft Windows Vista and 7) and perform kernel-mode hooks with kernel-mode patch protection policy enabled.<p>When the driver is loaded into kernel-mode address space it overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the disk by sending SRB (SCSI Request Block) packets directly to the miniport device object, then it initializes its hidden file system. The bootkits modules are written into the hidden file system from the dropper.<p>The TDL4 bootkit controls two areas of the hard drive one is the MBR and other is the hidden file system created at the time of malware deployment. When any application reads the MBR, the bootkit changes data and returns the contents of the clean MBR i.e. prior to the infection, and also it takes care of Infected MBR by protecting it from overwriting.<p>The hidden file system with the malicious components also gets protected by the bootkit. So if any application is making an attempt to read sectors of the hard disk where the hidden file system is stored, It will return zeroed buffer instead of the original data.<p>The bootkit contains code that performs additional checks to prevent the malware from the cleanup. At every start of the system TDL4 bootkit driver gets loaded and initialized properly by performing tasks as follows: Reads the contents of the boot sector, compares it with the infected image stored in hidden file system, if it finds any difference between these two images it rewrites the infected image to the boot sector. Sets the DriverObject field of the miniport device object to point to the bootkits driver object and also hooks the DriverStartIo field of the miniports driver object. If kernel debugging is enabled then this TDL4 does not install any of its components.<p>TDL4 Rootkit hooks the ATAPI driver i.e. standard windows miniport drivers like atapi.sys. It keeps Device Object at lowest in the device stack, which makes a lot harder to dump TDL4 files.<p>All these striking features have made TDL4 most notorious Windows rootkit and it is also very important to mention that the key to its success is the boot sector infection.<p>Another bit:<p>The original MBR and driver component are stored in encrypted form using the same encryption. Driver component hooks ATAPI's DriverStartIo routine where it monitors for write operations. In case of write operation targeted at the MBR sector, it is changed to read operation. This way it is trying to bypass repair operation by Security Products.",1344049645

That's always the excuse in my experience, even when it doesn't make any sense. At my previous university job, my department used an ancientand I really mean <i>ancient</i>shopping cart system. This thing had been written in ColdFusion during the mid-90s and they were still running it in 2009. It required all kinds of hand-holding and manual labor that should've otherwise been automated. Even though the original (outsourced) developer had long since disappeared, management refused to consider a new shopping cart.

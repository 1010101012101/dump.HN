I implemented the initial RTL routines and helped with some of the compiler support.<p>Delphi has multiple string types to handle all the backward compatibility issues. Ancient Pascal strings are limited to 255 characters; AnsiString (current code page), WideString (a COM BSTR), UnicodeString, and things like Utf8String (magic UTF-8 code page), etc. Assignments between the different strings perform conversions, and cause warnings for possible data-loss.<p>The more you learn about how strings work, including the international aspects, legacy aspects, OS-specific aspects, conversions at source code -> executable -> runtime -> I/O boundaries, etc., the more you appreciate the situation <i>really</i> isn't trivially reducible to simple lists of characters.",1259405793

Even if I was home alone and there was no chance of anyone looking over my shoulder, it just felt so... unsafe.<p>I wonder if other people have a similar reaction.<p>Might be better to make users type in the password a second time rather than give them a queasy feeling in the pit of their stomach.",1259405642

965032,comment,964210,964536,0,0,selven,,,"The basic pattern is that it's like trinary, but once you get to something ending in some 1s and finally a 2, the two starts to migrate upward, leaving 0s behind it (as in 10112, 10120, 10200, 11000) until the 2 disappears and you keep on going normally. The effect is that instead of digits flipping over all at once, as in 999998, 999999, 1000000, it happens one at a time. Very interesting number system.",1259405484

Get the student to search his soul on what he wants really. When a greed takes over, then everything becomes complex since everything looks so appealing.<p>Focus on one thing and work on one thing whole heartedly, whether business or PhD. When you are focus on one thing, pursue it with all your heart and don't look back, don't think of ""what if i fail? what if i choose wrongly?"". Once you have decided, ""cross the river"", ""burn all boats, dont look back"" and move forward. Its really that simple in life.<p>If you really should ""fail"", its not bad too because you would have learn valuable and important lessons. Its really the journey that matters and not so much on the end product. That way, you would not have lived your life in vain.

965018,comment,964091,964680,0,0,lucumo,,,"<i>> I'm sorry, but this statement doesn't make any sense in the digital era.</i><p>There are very few peer reviewed online journals. So everything posted online is without the benefit of peer review. Writing exclusively online therefore will not work; hence you're already page limited for one part of your publication. You could write two papers, but a) the effort required is a lot more and b) the longer one (for online publication) will still not be peer reviewed.<p>And really, if any competent climatologist can understand and infer some steps in your processing, why mention or explain them?<p>As for data, I don't think it will be very hard. It would probably require one or two days of collecting though. However, I doubt the demand is very high, among competent climatologists anyway. If it was, I would assume this would be common practice.<p><i>> This statement makes even less sense than the last one. The scientific soundness of data or method is unrelated to the intention of the analyzer. Publishing full details of the analysis can only strengthen confidence in the conclusion that has been reached. Only someone with reservations about the conclusion would seek to obscure the steps in the process by which it was reached.</i><p>If the requests for more information come from competent climatologists, I would have no argument with you. But that's not the case; at least in those cases we're hearing about. The requests are made by economists, politicians and people who have stated—without data to back them up—in the past they don't ""believe"" in climate change. Some even going so far as to call it a conspiracy—it never was clear to me what the climatologists were conspiring to do, though.<p>If the requests comes from competent scientists, you can rely on their personal integrity. If it comes from people with no scientific background, you can't. They have little to no understanding of the subject or the methods involved. You can be quite sure that that won't stop them from trying to interpret the data. Their conclusions are certain to be wrong, and—due to their preconceived notions—are certain to call into question: the integrity of the data, the integrity of the scientist, the integrity of his institute and the integrity of all climatologists. Most of the time explicitly too!<p>Since those guys are opinion leaders, the only effect would be another news article stating climate change doesn't exist and that it's all a big lie by climatologists. An article based on the pre-conceived opinion of an incompetent ""user"" of scientific data.<p>That doesn't strengthen confidence in the conclusion being reached; it weakens it. People should listen to the climatologist in such a situation, but they don't. They listen to the one who preaches the opinion they already had.<p>So refusing the data to those with ill intentions isn't based on reservations about the conclusion—it's based on the reservations about the intentions of the requester.<p>And all that is because people aren't playing ""science"" any longer, they are playing ""politics"". It's a different game and it has different rules.",1259403843

965016,comment,964518,964690,0,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"You miss the point. Yes, C isn't perfect when it comes to handling strings, but any halfway decent editor isn't based around having a single giant string in-memory anyway. C and Erlang can do just fine if you have, say, a tree of (length, data) tuples, with e.g. a couple of ""shadow trees"" for undo. C will be somewhat faster and lighter, and Erlang has automatic memory management, but there's no particular reason why either wouldn't work.",1259403536

965014,comment,964518,964864,0,0,barrkel,,,"It's not a tangent problem. It's at the very core of what a string is. I think you're confusing a representation of a string with what a string actually is, because it is convenient for your mental model of programming to believe - as an act of faith - that strings are lists of characters. Strings are just blobs of data that encode human-interpretable text. There is no underlying symmetry which proves that they fit into a monadic concept of a list, and indeed, they don't fit particularly well there.<p>Built-in string types can do things like warn that literal strings aren't convertible into target string type, at compile time; that an assignment from one string type to another may lose information, etc. Different string types may use different encodings, etc.",1259403090

It's certainly not always equal to reversing its bytes (depending on the encoding).

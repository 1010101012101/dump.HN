I do not have any phone with a version more recent than 4.4 (and that&#x27;s the case for everyone I know). In fact, my phone is only running 4.4 because I went through the trouble to look in Russian forums for custom ROMs for it, since the manufacturer didn&#x27;t get it beyond 4.2. My phone is a not very popular model, but even for some former flagships the only way to go is to get custom ROMs e.g. on XDA. Sure, I (and my friends) could get a new phone... but we are not interested in changing phones before they are even out of warranty (2 years in Europe).<p>This is no surprise: Google&#x27;s statistics[1] indicate 4.4 is still the most used version. Cheaper phones being launched with older Android versions doesn&#x27;t help, that&#x27;s true, but these cheaper models are good enough for many people. And to be honest, the features (and change in looks/functionality) introduced in the later versions do not interest me much.

The first were papers in the late 90&#x27;s or so showing semi-automatic partitioning of an application between a CPU and a FPGA w/ HLS for the FPGA. Their results were pretty cool. I envisioned something like that would be great for the day the FPGA was practically sitting right on the CPU.<p>The other thing came from my old, favorite, supercomputing vendor: SGI. They used to blow my mind repeatedly with how they did hardware. On the Altix NUMA systems, they had an option called RASC nodes that basically added 2 FPGA&#x27;s plus QDR RAM to the system. Like everything else, the FPGA&#x27;s attached to the <i>shared memory bus</i> to operate on whole memory directly with microseconds latency and several GB/s bandwidth. Not sure if modern FPGA&#x27;s are sitting on the memory bus inexpensively but RASC&#x27;s performance/integration showed it&#x27;s a great idea.<p>So, those were my two fun points on the subject. The next will probably be if I land a Pico Computing desktop w/ some high-end FPGA&#x27;s or if Archipelago gets closer to mature FPGA architecture. Either have much potential. :)",1447673692

At the simplest level this makes silly errors much easier and means you have to write more tests to maintain the same defect rate.<p>The lack of types mean you require extensive use of macros for advanced functionality. IME macros have major maintainability issues in a multi-person codebase.<p>Both these things are major disadvantages for automatic comprehensibility of code. Autocompletion can be more-or-less usable but will never be as good as in Java or Scala. Automated refactoring is inherently unsafe in the presence of macros (Scala&#x27;s fancier typed constructs (typeclasses, for/yield with custom types) mean you need macros much less often; Java tends to force you to expand these things out by hand (or else use annotations which act as de facto macros), which has its own maintainability issues but does at least mean automated refactoring will work correctly).<p>Some of the language culture pushes people towards less principled abstractions.

That&#x27;s normal. It takes time to get used to how the company works, how the codebase is structured, who&#x27;s responsible for what in the organisational structure.<p>If it&#x27;s a good company, there should be someone who you will be able to ask anything you need, no matter how often you need it. I&#x27;ve run multiple projects with perhaps a dozen programmers, and I try to make it very clear to new recruits that they are never bothering me. They don&#x27;t usually believe me at first, but I mean it! Any significant codebase has a huge amount of knowledge and structure known only to its developers, and new guys save so much time if they can just ask a quick question than dig around for themselves. So don&#x27;t be afraid to ask questions incessantly. Definitely form your question sensibly, but don&#x27;t sit around feeling stuck.<p>Honestly, I feel the most important thing you can learn in your first day/week is who is the best person to ask about each part of the code that you&#x27;ll be using, and a bit about the general structure of the code.

The thing is, the ad agency does not know whether I&#x27;ve made the purchase or not.  Usually, I&#x27;ll start researching something 1 day to 2-3months before purchasing depending on how large of a purchase it is, so the ads are useful up to the point I use the ad to make the purchase.  Unfortunately, after the purchase is done, the ad just becomes irrelevant and annoying.<p>So there&#x27;s probably a significant number of people where targeted advertising is able to get the click that leads to the purchase.

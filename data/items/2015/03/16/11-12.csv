I looked around for existing companes that could verify and issue certificates without the complex steps. Every company I looked at had a hugely detailed registration process or didn&#x27;t sell EV certificates - the ones that actually check your identity (like github, mozilla, stripe, and npm sites).<p>The main difference with Certsimple is the amount of work you have to do to get a certificate.The whole process of applying of a cert with CertSimple is now less than a minute.<p>This is because:<p>- We build the entire CSR command, including the subject for both Linux/Unix and Windows. There are no questions and answers. Just paste onto your server (using openssl or libressl on Unix and certreq on Windows) and paste the results.\n - We set correct the defaults for 2015 browsers (Chrome 41+ is now showing warnings for SHA1 certificates)\n - We automatically set the required encryption strength for an EV cert (2048 bits)\n - We check the CSR as soon as you paste it\n - We&#x27;re quite specific about the information we ask for, don&#x27;t repeatedly ask for the same thing, and a few other bits and pieces.<p>You won&#x27;t really notice any of this, though: you&#x27;ll just find it&#x27;s really easy.<p>The best way to experience this is to try it - it only takes a few seconds we don&#x27;t ask for payment until the process is complete.<p>10% of the profit from our certificates goes to The OpenBSD Foundation, GnuPG, the EFF or Open Rights Group (you pick your preferred source at the end of the order).<p>Mike",1426506515

You need all the essential syscalls to do something sensible and if any of the required parts doesn&#x27;t work the whole thing fails.<p>Another example would be refactoring a complex library into something more manageable. If you keep working in small, testable steps you can move only along the gradient, bordered by &quot;can execute&quot; and &quot;doesn&#x27;t execute&quot;. So you&#x27;ll be able to reach only a local extremum. Now if you&#x27;re in the fog and don&#x27;t know where to go, that&#x27;s fine. And for most development this is exactly how it happens. But sometimes you can see that summit on the other side of that rift and you know you have to take a leap to get over there.<p>I spent the past 3 weeks doing exactly that, refactoring a code base. I knew exactly where I wanted to go, but eventually it meant working for about a week on code without being able to compile, not even think of testing it, because everything was moving around and getting reorganized. However now I&#x27;m enjoying the fruits of that week; a much cleaner codebase, easier to work with and I even managed to eliminate some Voodoo code nobody knew why it was there, except that it made things work and things broke if you touched it.<p>> - Hold it in your head! Or you won&#x27;t have a clue what all your code, together, is doing.<p>Or, sometimes it&#x27;s important to get it out of your head, take a week or two off and look at it again with a fresh mind and from a different angle. Often problems seem only hard because you&#x27;re approaching them from that one angle and you&#x27;re so stuck with wanting to get it done, that you don&#x27;t see the better way.<p>Instead you should write code in a way that it&#x27;s easy to get back into it.<p>> - To get started, ask yourself, what is the simplest thing that could possibly work?<p>And then wonder: What would it take to make this simple thing break.

First, this is to protect weak devices and services on private networks or localhost, that really can&#x27;t be safely exposed to attacks pivoting from the web. It will block only sub-resource loads and navigation from the web to private networks. Navigating directly (via bookmarks or omnibox) or in the other direction (from private to web) is still fine. Essentially, this is applying similar rules to what&#x27;s already in place for file URLs.<p>We also appreciate the concerns for legacy apps, local servers, etc. That&#x27;s why we plan on supporting blocking UI overrides, opt-in by the page on localhost/private (maybe via CORS headers), and permanent exceptions via the command-line and enterprise policy. So, there might need to be some small tweaks, but all the use cases I&#x27;ve seen described in this thread should still work in a portable manner after these changes are made.<p>Also, to my knowledge no one is actively working on these changes yet.

9210883,comment,9208501,9210322,0,0,avar,,,"Exactly-once is possible in practice if you effectively bring the client under the umbrella of your transactions. E.g. you can (ab)use MySQL and other RDBMs to do something like:<p>1. Have a table where each row is a &quot;job&quot; or &quot;message&quot; and has a status which when enqueued is status = &quot;unclaimed&quot;. You can also have a `last_changed` column.<p>2. Have workers consuming that table that GET_LOCK() a row and set status = &quot;processing&quot; and hold the lock for the duration of the processing.<p>3. When they&#x27;re finished with the task they update status = &quot;finished&quot; and unlock the row (or equivalently, disconnect).<p>This requires much tighter coupling between the queue and the queue consumer (each client must maintain a lock / connection for the duration of processing items).<p>But it means that:<p>* Nothing will ever pick up the item more than once due to the GET_LOCK().<p>* If the consumer dies the item is either just unlocked, or the status is &quot;processing&quot;. You can as a matter of policy re-pick up &quot;processing&quot; with a `last_changed` in the distant past, alert on those items and manually inspect them.<p>* If the consumer processes the item successfully it&#x27;ll set the status to &quot;finished&quot; and nothing will process the item again.<p>Now obviously this requires a lot more overhead & maintenance than what you have in mind, in particular it makes some of the failure cases be &quot;the item is delayed due to a consumer dying and won&#x27;t be processed until a human looks at whether it was actually finished&quot;.<p>But this is the sort of pattern that you might use e.g. if you have a queue for sending out invoices.

Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t really care if she wins the science fair or not.  I suspect that if she decides to compete when the time comes, she&#x27;ll have a good shot at it just because of the level of effort we put into education and the equipment we have around the house. The majority of my free time and money is spent on this, so we have a lot of unusual stuff.<p>It&#x27;s easy to put that kind of effort into your own kids, because they live with you. They&#x27;re around for all of your spare moments, and they can use equipment you have access to that demands close supervision. Now here&#x27;s the part that&#x27;s relevant to your comment - I&#x27;m also heavily involved in her school, trying to do as much as I can for all of the other kids who are interested (the topics are computer science, math, and robotics). I get to spend maybe two hours a week working on that, after my other obligations are taken care of. It&#x27;s simply not possible for me to do more for the school, and even if I could the problem is concentration of resources. Given a certain budget (time and money) that I have available for this project, it&#x27;s obvious that I can make a large difference for a small number of kids, or a small (forgettable) difference for a large number. Taken to the extreme, I can make an enormous difference for one kid (mine). No matter what I try to do, I&#x27;ll never be able to make that kind of difference for even a small classroom full of kids, and certainly not a whole school. So I&#x27;m left with this choice: Do I spend my resources in a pursuit that&#x27;s likely to be ultimately fruitless (i.e. trying to &quot;raise all boats&quot;), or do I spend it on something I have a very high chance of success with? Which of those is more wasteful? My answer is that I do the best I can for the school, but I feel no guilt about giving more to my own kids.<p>In the end, if my daughter ends up winning a science fair it&#x27;s going to look exactly like a case of inherited privilege, and maybe that&#x27;s what it is. That&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m trying to hold down everyone else though, it&#x27;s just a simple matter of logistics.

The encrypted keys are decrypted by the travis-ci.org server during the build.<p>Lots of people seems to use them and travis-ci.org ends up with access to millions of secret keys. To me, centralizing such a big amount of secret data in the hands of such a small organization is a really bad idea but nobody seems to care.<p>Should we really trust the travis secure variables?<p>[1] http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/",1426504263

Some of the highlights of my decision to use this tool include:<p>- Uses native OS tools (tar, gzip, gpg in my case) for the actual backups and restores, and includes the actual command used to create the archive in the header of the archive!  You can use this to restore it without Amanda in the event of an emergency.<p>- Supports on-disk backups in a holding area for quick restores<p>- Supports S3 as a virtual tape library<p>- Supports vaulting (i.e. moving an archive from one tape library to another)<p>- Your choice of client, server, or no compression & encryption<p>- Highly scriptable<p>- Works over SSH, among other methods<p>- Catalog data is easily backed up itself via simple OS commands, and stored in S3.<p>The systems I backup are all in AWS, so this is ideal for me.  I&#x27;ve frequently thought it would be ideal to adapt Amanda&#x27;s script agents to creating EBS snapshots, but I simply haven&#x27;t had the time.  It&#x27;s on my someday-maybe list.  Remember to vault your backups to another region!<p>(Edits: formatting)",1426503989

Because the ZFS snapshot itself is just a stream you can also compress it on the wire.<p>Flexibility. You don&#x27;t need to send the snapshot to another ZFS server. You could just take the ZFS snapshot streams and store them on say S3 compressed and re-assemble them. This would take custom tooling but it&#x27;s definitely possible.<p>You can restore super quickly to an older version if you haven&#x27;t deleted the local snapshots.<p>Similar to above but if you don&#x27;t want to restore (as in make said snapshot the current active dataset) you can create a writable clone of one of the snapshots to play with it before committing to a restore or just to &quot;go back in time&quot; and play with something.<p>As a bonus you also now have your data on ZFS which has tons of great benefits apart from the point in time snapshots.",1426503724

I don&#x27;t believe that you won&#x27;t write a book because you&#x27;re not <i>qualified</i>: you just don&#x27;t want to write one. And that&#x27;s a good enough reason.<p>I think the community in general is very harsh towards anything related to cryptography. It&#x27;s as if you shouldn&#x27;t bother writing code unless you have mastery of the underlying mathematics while <i>at the same time</i> not bother with the maths unless you&#x27;re an expert very-low-level-language programmer.<p>There is certainly a need to put forward blatant errors and potential flaws. But the general harshness is misguided I think. Tptacek, you simply said out loud what many thought, I&#x27;m sure. You&#x27;d make a lot of people happy if you wrote a book. Because you&#x27;re still learning doesn&#x27;t mean others can&#x27;t learn from you.<p>Very subtly broken cryptography software is better than no cryptography software.

We can also include all chemistry and even fluid dynamics in a cell.\nE. g. to understand a computer: do we have to have to simulate on the electron leven with doped compounds and barriers, or is it enough to model it with characteristic curves of transistors, or is it even enough to model it on the binary level as switches between 0 and 1?",1397663992

It would be great if the readme could go into more detail about how the relationship between the hub, CLI, and cron works, including an explicit description of what text goes in the crontab files.<p>How do you get the reports of each run back to the hub? Are you wrapping each cronned command in a script which captures the output?<p>Does the hub have its own notion of what jobs exist on each machine? If so, there is the potential for this to get out of sync with what&#x27;s really on the machine (manual editing of crontab, database crash and restore from an old backup, etc). Is there any way to detect that, and bring them back into sync?<p>Can the hub form an opinion on whether any job has failed to run when it should? Can that be exposed to something like Nagios?<p>How do i integrate this with rcron for my highly available cronjobs?<p>Have you thought about supporing sqlite for a database?

7598549,comment,7597502,7597502,0,0,raffi,,,"I&#x27;ve lived in DC for nearly five years and I run a software company here. Here are my thoughts:<p>1. The quality of life here is very high. I believe this is probably one of the best places in the US for young professionals (its reputation hasn&#x27;t caught up with it yet).<p>* We have a strong bike sharing program and decent biking infrastructure. I&#x27;m not a biker and I use this most days now.<p>* I recently got rid of my car. I simply didn&#x27;t need it. I can walk in four directions to neighborhoods with great restaurants. I also have several grocery stores within walking distance.<p>* The North West part of the city is very clean.<p>* I don&#x27;t own a car. So long as I live here--I will not need a car.<p>* When I want to go running, Rock Creek Park is nearby. Same for the National Mall. If I want to go Kayaking on the Potomac, it&#x27;s a longer walk, but I can hit a Dept. of Parks and Recreation boathouse and get a kayak.<p>* DC has a short-ish winter. We get one and it gets cold. Some days we get snow the city doesn&#x27;t know what to do with. Overall though, January and February are the worst of it. Sometimes we get hints of Spring in March. April, Spring is usually here full bore. Spring and Fall here are beautiful. I&#x27;m from MI and I lived in Syracuse, NY. I judge weather through this lens.<p>2. DC is very expensive. I incorporated in DC and I suspect the city took a cue from the Spanish government in terms of forms and prerequisite forms and licenses one must acquire to start a business. They claim they&#x27;re pro-startup. I don&#x27;t see it. I just see a bureaucracy that nickels and dimes small businesses. Taxes are high too.<p>3. For my sector (cyber security) and the types of customers I have; DC is the perfect home base. I&#x27;m close to my customers and potential strategic partners. We even have a cyber security related accelerator in Northern Virginia. I see the concentration of folks and businesses in my industry as a big plus.<p>4. I travel a lot for my business. If I need to go to NYC--I take the Accela and I&#x27;m there in three hours. If I need to get into the suburbs of MD, I use the MARC train. If I need to fly, I have three airports to choose from. The closest airport (Reagan) is a 15-20 minute cab ride.<p>5. We have had a massive growth of startup and coworking spaces in the past two years. I don&#x27;t know where they all came from--but it&#x27;s insane. If you&#x27;re looking for semi-affordable office space co-located around other startups--you&#x27;ll find something here, probably walking distance from where you live.<p>6. DC benefits from a flood of ambitious folks who want to change the world and start their career here. When I moved here, I expected a scene of lawyers, lobbyists, politicians, and their hanger-ons. It&#x27;s not like that at all here. This is a very ambitious city with people who work very hard to make things happen. I like its energy and this is probably where I will stay.",1397663889

7598532,comment,7595440,7597481,1,0,h4pless,,,"The complexity for income tax law stems from tax breaks. There are all these different ways for people to pay less in taxes, but each rule for paying less has its own set of instructions and there are criminal and monetary liabilities for filing incorrectly. So it can be said that if you just pay your income taxes as they come and don&#x27;t claim any deductions, you are essentially over paying in taxes. Another problem problem that arises from this system of tax breaks is that it allows people receive more or less in deductions based on their life situation which is inherently inequitable.<p>Tax law doesn&#x27;t have to be so complex though. For example, you could just have a simple income-bracketed flat tax that is just at a lower rate than current taxes without any deductions possibly. Or possibly better yet, you could get rid of the income tax all together  and just use a federal tax on sales, real estate and money transfers out of the country. Granted, this would give the government more direct control over how much money is being collected on a daily basis and could result in some people feeling like they need to have a party with tea, but assuming we do live in a democratic society, something like a sales tax would be more understandable and visible to everyone (as the rate would be printed on all of their receipts) and it would probably lead to more oversight of the tax by the taxpayers rather than everyone just being concerned with paying less than they are asked to each year without getting audited.",1397663778

Since they are far ahead of competitors at this point, they want to win it as quickly as possible before competitors catch up.  This has nothing to do with Microsoft conceding anything - it&#x27;s simply that Office is far too important to be tied to Windows.",1397663517

Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse.

This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways.

Capital: $0 Buy: pay $2400/mo for 30 years. Spent: $864k. Capital: Whatever the house is worth.<p>1. As you&#x27;ve already mentioned, if you were to stay in the same area rent would be cheaper than a mortgage. Rent is always cheaper than a mortgage for equivalent real estate in the same area. So even if you moved, there would still be really strong reasons for renting since it would still be cheaper than buying a place. So your argument of $2400 rent vs $2400 mortgage is just wrong since moving to a different area will result in $1200 rent (or less).<p>2. Unlike a mortgage, you&#x27;re not going to be spending anywhere close to $864k upfront. At most it&#x27;s only going to be $7200 up front. If you were going to buy a place in the same neighborhood, it&#x27;s probably going to be about $400,000 upfront, not including closing costs and other fees. Not including stuff like renovation or housing insurance either. Don&#x27;t forget HOA for certain areas as well.<p>So if you have 500k in cash, if you rented you&#x27;ve about $492,800 for investing or for starting something up. If you bought a place in the same area, you have nothing for investing or starting something. So this &quot;$0k vs Whatever the house is worth&quot; argument is really flawed, especially when you consider that your capital is &quot;stuck&quot; with a huge opportunity cost unless 1) it appreciates a lot and you&#x27;re willing to BOTH sell and move into a cheaper place that isn&#x27;t as nice in terms of location or features (if you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re just stuck living in a nice expensive place which isn&#x27;t a bad thing but remember opportunity cost), or 2) you&#x27;re a professional house flipper (your home really is an investment and not just a place to live), and you repeat this process every 1-4 years.<p>If you haven&#x27;t already guessed, I&#x27;m not a renter and I just figured that you want something more than normal people since you roam HN.",1397662545

I tried to write a similar one for Lua, but LuaJIT ultimately recognized the program was useless and boiled it down to a 3 instruction loop:<p><pre><code>  loop:\n    add ebp, 1\n    cmp ebp, 10000000\n    jle loop\n</code></pre>\nAnyway, in regards to your results, I could be wrong, but I think I read somewhere that LuaJIT uses linear search for tiny tables for this reason. Dunno what the threshold is, if there is one. The performance then would be similar to an alist, but saving a few bytes and cycles by not needing to deal with the extra list pointers and indirection.<p>> Also, just to clarify, alist and property lists have a different behavior than hash-tables, namely that the sequential access allows you to shadow values from another list: if you write (cons (cons &#x27;a b) older-alist), you have a new list where the value for key &#x27;a is b, and where values for other keys are those found in older-list (even though older-list also contains key &#x27;a).<p>Oh yes, doesn&#x27;t emacs make good use of this trick for its configuration variables? You can get the same effect with Lua&#x27;s metatables, however, with a little elbow grease:<p><pre><code>  parent = { a = &quot;beep&quot;, b = &quot;boop&quot; }\n  print(parent.a) --> beep\n  print(parent.b) --> boop\n  child = { a = &quot;poing&quot; }\n  print(child.a) --> poing\n  print(child.b) --> nil\n  mt = { __index = parent }\n  setmetatable(child, mt)\n  print(child.a) --> poing\n  print(child.b) --> boop\n</code></pre>\nNot quite as easy as &quot;cons&quot;, but very flexible; __index can be another table to searched if the lookup on the child fails (which in turn can have its own parent and so on), but it can also be a &quot;metamethod&quot; that is called whenever a lookup fails and can then do arbitrary things. A neat example off the top of my head: OpenGL has the peculiarity that you do not know the address of any of its functions until runtime, requiring a program to call a lookup function for each function to get a usable pointer. Declaring FFI function prototypes for many OpenGL functions is not such a big deal, but looking up hundreds of functions that you will never use can add significantly to startup time. So someone (possibly an HN user?) wrote an OpenGL FFI library that uses the __index metamethod in a clever way; the first time a function like &quot;GL.CreateShader&quot; is called, the lookup fails, and the __index metamethod mangles the index name a bit and in turn calls (on Windows) the C function wglGetProcAddress to look up its address, which it then stores in the original table. Using this library, you can write code that uses GL functions willy-nilly, and their addresses will automatically be looked up at runtime the first time they are used.<p>Sure, you can do the same thing in any language with macros or a preprocessor, but is that cool or what?",1397662352

So, what I would do is start with a simple, secure design based on an AEAD like AES-GCM, which is also in the Golang standard library. I would accompany that design with very strong warnings that substituting AES-GCM for anything else is likely to destroy the security of the design. Then, when I wanted to teach about generically composed MACs, my HMAC example would involve replacing AES-GCM with AES-CTR+HMAC. At no point in the book would the focus of one of my chapters be a design that was dreadfully insecure.<p>I would also divide the book into two parts, the &quot;easy&quot; part and the &quot;hard&quot; part. The &quot;easy&quot; part would get readers to the point where they can safely use TLS, reliably PGP-encrypt something, hash a password, and invoke NaCl (which is part of the go.crypto package). I would probably spend a whole chapter on how to use Golang&#x27;s TLS library, for instance. Most readers that are picking the book up so they can solve some business problem would probably never need to get past the &quot;easy&quot; part, and I would encourage them not to.<p>I would remove from the &quot;hard&quot; half of the book protocols that were insecure. An unauthenticated DH exchange is a poor basis for a cryptographic transport. Slash, cut, gone. A naive password challenge-response protocol doesn&#x27;t solve anyone&#x27;s business problems. Slice, snip, gone. In their place, I&#x27;d probably add more discussion of key exchange algorithms, with particular attention paid to how easy they are to get wrong.",1397662090

But for that reason you could probably get away with less heap in the RS, leaving more for the OS.  However, keep in mind that the HBase block cache is optimized for HBase use case, whereas OS cache is not.

Professionals do one of three things with criticism: ignore it, rebut it, or learn from it. My assumption has been that Kyle is choosing options (1) and (3) from that list. But here you are, inventing option (4): &quot;get indignant about it&quot;. I wonder if you&#x27;ve thought about the extent to which people will attribute that response not to you, but to Isom.<p>Second, whatever you might think about the tone of my feedback, it&#x27;s clear that Isom needs additional technical review for his book. Whipping up a totally unproductive us-versus-them narrative about &quot;jerks&quot; versus &quot;open source&quot; does the opposite: it generates drama. Even if you think my review was itself dramatic, piling more drama on doesn&#x27;t make Isom&#x27;s work more attractive to experts.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how big of a deal either of these issues are, but they&#x27;re a bad habit for message board denizens. The exact same thing happened to Willem when he wrote his critique of the Akamai allocator, and Hacker News had a totally unproductive drama storm for a couple hours before Akamai (a) thanked Willem and (b) acknowledged that he was absolutely correct. Read the Akamai comments on the HN thread, and apply them here, substituting &quot;Kyle Isom&quot; for &quot;Akamai&quot;, and I think you&#x27;ll see that they apply.<p>Finally, I&#x27;ll admit to being personally irritated by the claim that I operate from &quot;experts only&quot; logic with regards to cryptography. There are at last count something like <i>twelve thousand</i> people who have reached out to us for our free crypto challenges, and thousands of those people have gone on to solve multiple sets of challenges (something like 60 people have finished the first 6). Every damn one of those people is an email exchange that me, Sean, or Marcin had to have directly, on our own time, with no compensation --- the opposite of compensation, in fact, because we donate to charity when people finish them.<p>There are a lot of people on the Internet to whom you could direct the &quot;experts only elitism&quot; criticism regarding crypto. I am not one of them.<p>What&#x27;s more annoying about that bogus critique is how it muddles a real issue. I&#x27;d like many more people to understand crypto and, particularly, what goes wrong when it&#x27;s implemented naively. But I&#x27;d like far fewer people to plow ahead and implement their own broken stuff. The track record on amateur cryptography is bad, and what developers don&#x27;t like to acknowledge is that the badness that work generates is an externality to them. People have in the real world been hurt, physically, because of broken amateur crypto. It is hard for me to take the hurt feelings of developers all that seriously by comparison.",1397661400

Overall, I am impressed.<p>Good stuff in 8.1:<p>- The new calendar user interface, as Anand points out in his review, is more polished than it was in 8.  This was needed since the Calendar in 8 was a bit amateurish in its appearance.  If you looked really close, you could see that it used pseudo-Latin words on the days in the month view to indicate you had appointments on those days.  But the words weren&#x27;t the appointment names!<p>- Six columns of live tiles (3 of medium size) makes the home screen information-dense.  I have headlines, updates, the latest movie news, calendar items, weather, TSLA&#x27;s price ($192??  Maybe time to buy more?), e-mails, and a bunch of other nonsense flipping around and dancing.  It&#x27;s a bit chaotic but overall I like this a whole lot more than what I remember from when I used Android and before that, iOS.<p>- The signal strength, wifi, and battery life indicators are now always on the home screen.  You no longer need to tap the top of the screen to see these.  I liked the minimalism they were aiming for by making these slip away after a moment in 8.  But I can see why they decided to bring them back as permanent fixtures.  Luckily, they still hide in apps, giving maximal screen real-estate to productivity.<p>- Finally, an official podcast application that accepts URLs.  In 8, I wasn&#x27;t able to subscribe to a podcast via URL, so if the podcast I wanted wasn&#x27;t in Microsoft&#x27;s library, a third-party app was needed.<p>- Accessories such as Data Sense, which gives a breakdown of data utilization, and Storage Sense, which shows how storage space is used.  These types of accessory are old news for Android and iOS, but were oddly lacking on WP.  I had been using a horrible proprietary AT&T app to monitor data usage previously.<p>- The notifications (&quot;Action Center&quot;) user interface is nice.  Very Android-ish.<p>- Cortana is a cute addition.  Finally having a voice assistant app confirms the suspicion I had when Siri arrived on iOS: I don&#x27;t really have much of a use case for this.  I suppose the next time I need directions somewhere, this will be nice.  The sparkle of more promise is in Cortana&#x27;s potential to interface with applications.  If, for example, Cortana can use GroupMe (my messaging application of choice) to send messages in addition to SMS, I could find myself using that more frequently.  But I don&#x27;t use a lot of SMS, so Cortana&#x27;s messaging feature is of limited value to me.<p>Bad stuff:<p>- I&#x27;ve had the Calendar application and the music player each crash once.  And in both cases, it was a device-reboot style crash.  This is a developer build, so I will give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt that the final version will not crash like this.<p>- Cortana isn&#x27;t quite living up to its potential.  I&#x27;ve not actually used Siri, so I am not saying it&#x27;s worse than Siri.  But I want to see more applications support Cortana, and more smoothly than is done by the few that do integrate today (&quot;Flixster, show latest movies&quot;).  For example, I&#x27;d like Cortana to just <i>know</i> that I use GroupMe to message my wife and SMS to message someone else.  As another example, Twitter doesn&#x27;t seem to be integrated into Cortana much yet.  I think the only integration is Cortana pushing tweets out.  Incoming just arrive to the Twitter app and notifications.",1397661122

See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haig%E2%80%93Simons_income"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haig%E2%80%93Simons_income</a>.<p>Say I&#x27;m a shopkeeper. I sell you a candy bar for $2.00, and receive a payment for that amount? Is that my income? No. The credit card processing fee, the cost of getting the candy bar delivered from the wholesaler, and the cost of the candy bar itself must be paid out of that $2.00, but do not represent changes to my own wealth. Deductions exist to go from &quot;gross income&quot; (the payments you receive), and &quot;taxable income&quot; (the amount that your wealth actually increases).<p>Now, say I&#x27;m a farmer. I buy a new tractor. I should be able to deduct the cost of that tractor from what I make selling my crops. But should I get to take the deduction for the full value immediately? No! Unlike a candy bar, which is gone as soon as the customer purchases it, the tractor is a capital asset (an asset that is used to produce income). When I buy a tractor, my wealth just changes form: I have less cash, but I have a tractor. Over time, the value of the tractor will decrease. Eventually, the full cost of the tractor should be deductible, but because the tractor will help produce income over many years, the deductions should be taken over many years. Otherwise, because of the time value of money, the taxes paid will understate my actual increase in wealth. This is what &quot;depreciation&quot; is all about. Because it&#x27;s impractical to actually sample the change in value of the tractor each year, it happens according to fixed &quot;depreciation schedules.&quot; And when you sell the tractor, the difference between its market value and its value according to the depreciation schedule generates income or loss that must be accounted for.<p>Now, say I own a house (or stock). It&#x27;s value goes up every year, which represents an increase in my wealth. Should I pay the IRS a tax each year based on an estimated amount? That would be very inconvenient, so we have a whole system of &quot;realization events&quot; that define when continuous changes in wealth must be &quot;sampled&quot; and tax paid.<p>As I noted in my post, a lot of this complexity just falls out of accounting. You&#x27;re right that the various measures to use the tax code to create incentives/disincentives also complicates the situation, on top of the inherent complexity. But it&#x27;s not a given that the value of these incentives/disincentives is less than the burden of the additional complexity.",1397661036

7598203,comment,7597090,7597253,1,0,hyp0,,,"Yes. My take: it&#x27;s triggered by consumer needs being &quot;overshot&quot;: phones better (2.3GHz, quad-core, 3GB, HD), do you <i>really</i> need it?<p>Integration is crucial for meeting consumer needs when the tech was not as good: the first iPhone had a tiny CPU and GPU, but they managed to squeeze adequate performance by connecting everything with extreme efficiency.<p>But once it&#x27;s good enough, people start to worry about other factors - like I want a big battery, but I don&#x27;t need 3G (or vice versa). Customization, not just replacing broken bits. Here, a modular approach shines. But it&#x27;s less efficient, so there needs to be spare power. The key driver is that users want customization more than they want extra compute power.<p>Android is modular, compared to iOS, and it&#x27;s worked out well - once phone got powerful enough. It <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> have in the very earliest days, because the spare power wasn&#x27;t there. Hardware modularity is the next step. It may be a little early, but I think it&#x27;s clear that <i>high-end</i> phones have wildly overshot mainstream needs (a quad-core HD <i>phone</i>!? what a boondoggle). Actually, today mid- and low-end phones are perfectly fine for most people.<p>PS: this pressure will also drive the next category - whether it&#x27;s iWatches or iGlasses or something else, I don&#x27;t know, but it will be smaller, more convenient, cheaper, easier to use - and there won&#x27;t be power to spare in such a small form-factor. Therefore, it&#x27;s likely that Apple will do it (hence the i&#x27;s) since they are the company most integrated across all the levels of hardware, silicon, OS, apps, appstore. They are best placed to squeeze the needed performance (doesn&#x27;t guarantee they will though).",1397660782

Skepchick reports him to his email host (in this case, GoDaddy), under their spam terms.<p>GoDaddy does their standard process, which includes asking for opt-in proof, and revealing the email. Crazy guy goes crazy and makes a website dedicated to trying to defame Skepchick, using info he found about her online.<p>The problem is, this wasn&#x27;t typical spam. Meaning, this wasn&#x27;t some bot sending out Viagra sales pitches or the &quot;great investment leads&quot; people that send me 30 messages a day. This was unsolicited mail, yes, but it was with an agenda. Basically, I&#x27;d classify it more as harassment.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the situation would have been handled differently if it was flagged/seen/filed as harassing messages, rather than spam. I don&#x27;t know, but I have to assume GoDaddy has an abuse team and that their methods of handling this sort of thing would be different.<p>Please understand, I&#x27;m not putting the onus on Skepchick to correctly know how to classify the message. It stands to reason she thought this was spam. But at the same time, I don&#x27;t know if this sort of edge case is common enough to require a more complex method such as SHA-1 hashes.<p>Shitty situation all the way around, but I think the biggest problem was this was treated as a normal case of spam, when really it was a case of abuse/crazy.",1397660700

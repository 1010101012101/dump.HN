The frontend stuff was very nice ""Hello, <?php echo $username ?>"", not ""<?php $query = ""SELECT  * from ..."" ... ?>"".<p>Finally, PHP is only slightly slower than Python and Perl, and slightly faster than Ruby.<p>So although using PHP is a horrible idea, Facebook seems to be dealing with it.  It sure isn't the path of least resistance, though.  It's much easier to write good $ANYTHING_ELSE than good PHP.",1209303037

It can also embed, links to files, rich text copied directly from safari, etc.  For online viewing you can either use the built in web server or export as HTML periodically.<p>I use email for updates when I'm away from my laptop.  It's easy for me to type things up in a rough form for processing later and I can use it almost anywhere (I took 6KB of notes during the startup school on my blackberry)",1209301527

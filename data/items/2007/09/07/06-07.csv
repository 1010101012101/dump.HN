51558,comment,51451,51537,0,0,timr,,,"The arguments I hear most frequently are the same ones that Linus jumps on in this thread:  the syntax is obtuse, the code isn't portable, and the language isn't truly high-level (i.e. it doesn't have built-in garbage collection).<p>The first argument is (sadly) true -- C++ is ugly and complicated.  A lot of that comes from the need for backwards compatibility with C (which isn't going to win any language beauty pageants, either), but a lot more of it comes as a consequence of the syntactic flexibility of the language.<p>The second argument is mostly bunk.  A decade ago, it was difficult to find a standards-compliant C++ compiler; today, it's fairly easy.  Sure, there are dark corners of the language where certain compilers get funky, but that can be said of FORTRAN 77 compilers, too.  In general, unless you're forced to work with a old compiler, or an old, unmaintained package, it isn't very difficult to write cross-platform C++ code.<p>The third argument is just a straw man.  Anyone who has read Stroustrup's book on the design of C++ knows why garbage collection and other ""high-level"" features weren't incorporated into the standard -- they didn't want to force users to adopt particular programming models or designs.  Stroustrup has insisted that C++ be a flexible tool for many different types of programs and programmers;  that attitude leads, somewhat inevitably, to complexity.   But it makes me sad that so many people are bashing on C++ for not being ""more like"" other languages, when its biggest strength is probably its ability to mimic many features of those same languages, while still <i>allowing for</i> great efficiency.",1189147812

51556,comment,51397,51397,0,0,mironathetin,,,"I fear it has been said a hundred times. But its still right: <p>Don't work hard, work smart!<p>If you don't use your brain to plan, replan and think again, even hard work will get you nowhere (or at random places).<p>Well, surely working hard and working smart can be combined. But there is a limit: I usually stop coding, after it takes me too long to find the right algos. Sure I can go on then with stupid things like taxes, telephone calls and so on. But if I do, I have to pay back for that the next morning.<p>So basically I would answer the original post with: think!, then work as hard as you can, but get your breaks. All has to be well balanced or you'll burn out. Best is, if you find things that relax and that you'll enjoy while doing more work (having beer with your co-founders ;o). \n",1189147770

In the information age, it's not really smart to be a car salesman of the startup world; especially when the number of new engineers is consecutively getting smaller every year in the US.

51551,comment,51451,51451,0,0,eusman,,,"maybe this will help you <p>Stroustrup: Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I thought of this little scheme, which would redress the balance a little. I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain your sanity.<p>[NJW Comment: That explains everything. Most of my thesis work was in raw X-windows. :)]<p>Interviewer: You're kidding...?<p>Stroustrup: Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another problem. Unix was written in 'C', which meant that any 'C' programmer could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?<p>Interviewer: You bet I do, that's what I used to do.<p>Stroustrup: OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a decent living too.<p>Interviewer: I don't believe you said that...<p>source: <a href=""http://members.safe-t.net/jwalker/programming/interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.safe-t.net/jwalker/programming/interview.html</a>",1189146965

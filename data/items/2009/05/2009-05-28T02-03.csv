629615,comment,628659,628972,0,0,wallflower,,,"> The laboratory for ""let's do something crazy and see if it works"" in football is college ball, though you are seeing pro ball get more adventurous in recent years.<p>The forward pass itself was actually an innovation that was introduced by UNC Chapel Hill into American football over 100 years ago. Before the forward pass, college teams simply brute-forced the ball forward.<p>""John Heisman, a noted historian, wrote 30 years later that, indeed, the Tar Heels had given birth to the forward pass against the Bulldogs (UGA). It was conceived to break a scoreless deadlock and give UNC a 6-0 win. The Carolinians were in a punting situation and a Georgia rush seemed destined to block the ball. The punter, with an impromptu dash to his right, tossed the ball and it was caught by George Stephens, who ran 70 yards for a touchdown.<p>Heisman wrote he was at the game standing near the action on the sidelines. He is emphatic that Pop Warner, who was coaching Georgia, protested to the referee to no avail. And he adds that he personally wrote Walter Camp, the final authority on football, of the possibilities of the ‘forward pass’ making football a new and more exciting game.""<p><a href=""http://tarheelmania.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/unc-invented-the-forward-pass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tarheelmania.wordpress.com/2007/09/13/unc-invented-th...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass</a>",1243478382

However, being educated as a mechanical engineer and self-taught as a sysadmin/developer, I think what is missing here is the influence of teachers.  This is a somewhat ironic thought since my engineering professors did little to really give me great insight into engineering or the practice of it. What I do know is this: Someone who wanted to learn administration or development could learn more in one week with me than they would in one year of college or learning by themselves.  The information might not be as deeply embedded in their brain as it is in mine, due to all the pain and suffering of figuring things out for myself, but I often wish I'd had a great teacher or mentor.

It may be my perception that people are more likely to disregard morality that makes me believe they are less moral, rather than animals being <i>more</i> moral.  It also seems apparent that humans can express moral behaviors that surpass many species, so I may have jumped the gun by saying animals are <i>more</i> moral than people.  If humans can disregard morality and other animals cannot, though that would seem to mesh with the ""sense"" I have about them being more moral.<p>I don't really know, just kind of typing it and thinking it at the same time.

831533,story,,,6,4,kickstand,"Ask HN: promoting and positioning very early stage web apps?",,"I'll put the ""TL/DR"" version up front: When following the ""it's never too early to launch"" philosophy, how do you position the application to visitors or potential customers?<p>I hear PG and others saying often that you can't really launch too soon; that you should launch as soon as your app is remotely useful; in fact that if you were not uncomfortable with the state of the product when you first launched you waited too long.<p>I've done that, launching the first iteration site of a site in the past week. While the feedback (quite limited so far) is helpful and interesting, frankly I am a bit uncomfortable with the state of the product. The site has some utility but it should be obvious to anyone who spends any time on there that this product is in what I'd consider a pre-beta state.  It's not that the site is buggy or that there are dead ends or ""coming soon"" links or anything like that.  The features that exist in the live version are relatively polished. It's just that the site is clearly ""light"" on features and content.<p>I want the feedback from having my application live, but I'm afraid my app isn't complete enough yet to justify promoting it very much. But without promotion I won't get much feedback.<p>(One answer is laboratory style user testing, paper prototyping and the like, but I could have (and to a limited extent, did) do that without launching.  I believe there's something valuable about the real world context, but I'm not entirely comfortable with the initial impression I'm giving to visitors.)<p>So, how do you position a very early phase site with customers/visitors/users?  I guess we could slap a ""beta"" sticker on the logo, but that feels like the modern equivalent the ""under construction"" digging guy from the 90s--it indicates ""broken and likely to stay that way"" as much as ""early stage and dynamically improving"".  Besides, is ""beta"" is just a term of art for our industry? Does the public at large relate to ""beta"" in a meaningful way? I'm not sure my target market does.<p>Is there a way to say ""yes, we know it is lame right now but just you wait and see"" without turning off potential users or looking unprofessional?  Is there a way to send a strong enough message to invite the public at large to check out the site without setting them up to say, ""lame, call me back when it's ready?""",1253324825

",,"I would consider myself a very experienced front-end web developer, I usually use jQuery and can almost always get it to do exactly what I want in a very intuitive way.  I am forced to use prototype/scriptaculous for a small project (really just some light animations/dom manipulation on a page), and I have to say that I am really shocked with how inconsistent and confusing it seems.  I know that this combination is very popular within the Rails community and I am wondering if I can get some help on a few issues I am having.  I think I must be doing certain things wrong but I cant seem to find the answers anywhere.<p>Below is a list of oddities that I am running in to, I would really appreciate anyone familiar with prototype to take a read through them.  I am not interested in starting a JS library war, only in knowing why I might be  finding it so difficult to use.<p>- Why does $('element_id').getStyle('height') only return a value if the value has been set with inline css (ie by doing something like style=""height: 40px"" on the element).  If the value is set in an external CSS file or in the HTML head, the .getStyle function returns 0.<p>- Why can't I do an Effect.Appear (and others) on an element by class name, I know that prototype should let me do a $$('[any css selector]'), but with something like Effect.Appear I apparently have to set an ID on my target element and use that. I can do ""Effect.Appear('idname');"" and ""Effect.Appear($('idname'));"" but not ""Effect.Appear($$('.classname'));""  Does prototype force you to use IDs for every element you want to interact with?<p>- Why is it ""Effect.Fade"" (capital F) but ""Element.hide"" (lower-case h) - I know that one is technically prototype and one is script.aculo.us, but come on.<p>- Why doesn't this example work consistently? http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/128280/prototype-test.html  The small box should always start animating at the same position, it works if you leave your mouse off the box for a while, but if you bring it back over within a few seconds or so it starts animating at the previous ending position and flickers a lot.<p>- Sometimes i have to do ""new Effect.something"" and other times I don't need the ""new"".  Eg: I can just do ""Effect.Appear"" but I have to do ""new Effect.Move""<p>- I always use Firebug for catching typos and debugging my jQuery code, but I immediately noticed that with Prototype, many errors just cause the rest of the JS to not function, but no error is listed in Firebug.  This is frustrating, especially for a new user who is not comfortable with all the various syntax.  Is there anything I can do to catch these errors?<p>Thanks!",1253322825

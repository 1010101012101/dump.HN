4815342,comment,4814601,4815160,5,0,_delirium,,,"> Lots of cities in Europe are filled with buildings of that height and it doesn't seem to hurt their quality of life too badly.<p>It's actually pretty common for European cities to limit high-rise condos/office buildings in the city centers (usually with limits around 5-8 stories). To still achieve dense housing, tall condos and office buildings are usually built close to public transit somewhere a bit outside of the city center, plus the suburbs don't start as close in, so there's a bigger urbanized area. The Manhattan/Chicago/Vancouver style of a downtown characterized by skyscrapers isn't very common in Europe; more of a North American invention, particularly in the Chicago/Vancouver form where there's a high-rise downtown that quickly turns into suburban homes within a few kilometers.<p>The SF equivalent might be to not allow condo towers in SF, but to urbanize the areas a few BART stops out: why are there single-family homes, not denser housing, in San Bruno, West Oakland, and Daly City? But of course, the Peninsula is even <i>more</i> anti-development than SF is, so politically that just trades one source of opposition for another one (to take another example, people have been trying to convince Palo Alto to allow more dense housing near downtown/Stanford/Caltrain for years, but Palo Altoans want to keep it suburban).",1353520521

I live in England and space is quite expensive here if you want to have quality too, for example I pay $2500 per month for ~<600 square feet apartment, an apartment I was looking at in London was ~$4200 per month for 800 square feet (it was a high quality residence).

The ""amazing"" part is a genuine compliment: you found a pattern in the number of days in each month that I never noticed (the 'flip' trick). Being able to see these kinds of patterns and take advantage of them is an invaluable skill in programming.<p>The problem here, of course, is that it makes the code a lot harder to understand. To understand and verify the function, I'd start by writing out a table of the days in each month while reciting the ""30 days hath September"" rhyme. :-) Then I'd have to go through all the the flip and non-flip cases in the code and compare against my table.<p>Let's imagine that JavaScript didn't have convenient date calculations so we couldn't use the updated function I posted above. If that were the case, what would be a simpler way to code the function? Just <i>use</i> the table of months directly. After all, there are only 12 months to deal with, so it's very simple:<p><pre><code>    getCountDays: function( year, month ) {
        var monthDays = [
            31,  0, 31, 30, 31, 30,

        ];
        return monthDays[month] || getFebDays( year );
    },
</code></pre>
where getFebDays() handles all the special cases for leap years ( /4, /100, /400, etc.)<p>Now, with the exception of February, it's trivial to see at a glance if the function is correct.",1353519842

The low power 22nm Ivy Bridge cores are only 14W, so I'd really wanted to have seen a comparison to a more recent CPU.<p>The Exynos wipes the floor on the parallel NAS tests.  I'm not sure why exactly.<p>The Atom core has known issues with floating point relative to desktop CPUs, and the A9 was never particularly good at it.  So the FFTE results showing the A15 about 50% faster than Atom and 2x faster than A9 are a surprise.  It's almost what I'd expect to see from a desktop box at that.<p>On the other hand, the 7-zip and x264 tests are integer dominated and largely cache-bound, and the A15 doesn't show itself off particularly well here, mostly matching the A9 and Atom per-clock.  Yawn.  (This is an area where all these CPUs get toasted by Ivy Bridge, btw -- remember that 14W TDP?)<p>The ""Smallpt Global Illumination Renderer"" and ""C-Ray"" tests (which I don't know anything about per se) shows everyone about the same (and for Smallpt 2x as fast as PandaBoard).  So I'm going to guess this means the tests are DRAM-bound, and thus infer that the A15 has a similar memory bandwidth to Atom (probably 2x 32 bit vs. the Pine Trail 1x 64 bit channels).

They don't remember the old days of CRTs, where 60Hz was painfully flickery, and you wanted at least 75Hz to relieve eye strain. 75 or 85Hz with corresponding fps was much slicker than 60Hz.<p>IMO the purists complaining about 48Hz are complaining about a subconscious association, perhaps a bit like the smell of popcorn in the lobby. It's not an objective complaint, but as a subjective one it may be shared by a large proportion of the audience.

4815218,comment,4814322,4815051,19,0,jules,,,"One surprise that you find out when you do this is that languages like C don't efficiently map to hardware at all. Hardware is inherently massively parallel, whereas C is completely serial. What modern hardware is doing to be fast is trying to recover as much fine grain parallelism from a sequential C program as possible using pipelines and out of order execution. We are now at a point where that has been mostly milked out, so explicit parallelism is necessary to gain performance, like SIMD and multiple threads.<p>It's interesting to consider how you can exploit parallelism more easily, for example from going from a sequential instruction set and language to an inherently parallel instruction set and language. Nobody has found the ultimate answer to that yet. GPUs execute thousands of sequential threads in parallel, and while that works for problems with massive and regular parallelism, it does not work for irregular parallelism or parallelism that requires fine grain communication or short lived parallelism or not-so-massive parallelism. FPGAs do work well for those types of parallelism, but they have other problems for general purpose computing. With hardware trends, it's inevitable that we'll see more and more parallelism and eventually a paradigm shift to inherently parallel architectures. Interesting times ahead.",1353518986

So this whole rant is not directly related to the post's central thesis. Instead, it's about the assumptions most people have whenever this topic comes up.<p>What I'm a little annoyed with can be summed up with a single banal and overused phrase: ""the right tool for the right job"".<p>For one, this phrase really doesn't say all that much--it's basically a tautology. Yes, using the right tool would be good, but with programming languages, it's rarely obvious what the right tool <i>is</i>! It's just a specialized version of the advice to ""make the right choices"", which is not much advice at all.<p>Another problem is that people inevitably ignore how much programming languages overlap. Virtually any languages worth comparing are going to be <i>general-purpose</i> languages. Choosing between a functional language and an OO language is not like choosing between a hammer and a screwdriver to pound in a nail, it's more like choosing between different types of hammer. In a world where hammers can do anything. (I don't know enough about carpentry to extend the analogy properly.) There are very few applications where one language clearly fits and another is clearly unsuited--and if you're in a vertical like that, the question just won't come up in the first place!<p>Another thing that comes up is people assuming that a multi-paradigm language has the benefits of <i>all</i> the paradigms it supports. I've found this is never the case. Even very multi-paradigm languages tend to favor one paradigm or the other more. And even if they didn't, there are benefits to being consistent. You can do much more by being functional <i>everywhere</i> than you can by merely supporting functional programming in some places. Any mix of paradigms is necessarily going to be a compromise, and the advantages of prioritizing one main paradigm can outweigh the flexibility of supporting more than one to any large extent. Doing one thing, and doing it well, is a powerful idea that doesn't stop applying in designing programming languages.<p>Now, I'm not leaning one way or the other here in any comparison of languages (I'm sure my biases are pretty evident and show through, they're just not germane to this comment); I just think that summarily dismissing a language for being too focused or too ""extremist"" or not multi-paradigm is rather short-sighted. Also, often, unless you've tried doing something in a language yourself, don't assume it's more difficult than what you already know. There is much ""common wisdom"" about (like ""functional programming is bad for GUIs"") which is often more ""common"" than ""wisdom"".",1353518697

There is generally plenty of parking outside of downtown.<p>Nope, MUNI is awful. Unless you live relatively close on one of the train lines, you are in for a world of hurt. The average speed of a MUNI bus has been going down continuously over time (due to extra traffic), to the point where it is now like 7mph. That means it takes an hour to go from one end to the other (vs 25 minutes tops to go a similar distance on BART). That means more people get cars, which means the buses get even slower. I'd happily pay the NYC monthly rates if I had an equivalent transit system.<p>> Not building high rises is preserving the quality of life SF is known for<p>San Francisco doesn't need to build high rises everywhere in the city, it needs to allow taller buildings (6-7 stories) in more areas without forcing developers to jump through all the hoops they have to right now. Lots of cities in Europe are filled with buildings of that height and it doesn't seem to hurt their quality of life too badly.

Does your thesis deal with solving inverse problems, or with visualization, or with monte carlo simulation using forward models?  If it's problem-based, what particular problems do you consider?  Are there graphical representations of the forward problem?  Do you intend to actually solve the inverse problem and show its solution, or just make a drawing of what you think the solution would be?<p>In my field, a typical inverse problem involves source term estimation.  Imagine you have a forward model of atmospheric transport.  That is, given a source of some gas or radiological particle, the model predicts its concentration in the surrounding area, over time.  A graphical representation of that forward problem might be, for example, a contour map of 24-hour exposures.<p>For such a situation, an inverse problem is to estimate, based on a few sensor readings, the strength and location of a source.  A graphical representation of that inverse problem might be a contour map of probabilities that the source is in a given location.",1353517782

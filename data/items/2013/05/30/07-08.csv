Some CDM vendors will restrict their plugin from working on open browsers, but there is no reason to do that as the CDM can be the unit processing the protected stream and rendering it. This means that open browsers can implement this spec and use CDMs that conform to an open ABI without compromising the protection of the content.<p>The CDM if used this way will be responsible for rendering a video or audio stream, not a shared graphics context like Flash or Java, and overlay graphics and UI will be implemented in standard HTML not in the closed CDM module.",1369900652

That you have closed sourced browsers interpeting markeup is also completely OK. As long as the markup and code produced and published is compliant to the open standards we have all agreed upon.<p>Because then anyone with the specification can interact with that content. That means that anyone, of any size, can sit down and implement a fully valid and compliant web-browser.<p>This latest proposal from W3C means an end to that. Having the HTML specification will not be enough to create software able to render all the content on the web. Your browser will need to be ""sanctioned"" and ""supported"" by the DRM-vendors in order to work on the web.<p>New platforms (FirefoxOS, Tizen, etc), new browsers, any new players at all and all open source endeavours are effectively shut out from this new web the W3C is drafting. That is unacceptable.<p>This is a disastrous departure from any former W3C specification and directly in opposition to the W3C's own mission statement.<p>We are only left to guess what sort of corruption has lead to W3C sinking this low.

That creates a much more difficult market for workers with relatively low marginal productivity to find work.<p>Also, the population has a far more top-heavy age distribution than it used to have.

The money we got was useful, definitely, but that's not why we did it. We could have bootstrapped. The main advantage of an accelerator is that you get to put your ideas in front of a stream of very smart people who each have experience of building companies. You get to learn from their mistakes. That's tremendously useful. In 3 days of the Ignite programme we pitched to about 40 entrepreneurs, and many more during the rest of the 13 weeks. Those people are now amazing contacts, fantastic mentors, and in some cases, investors in subsequent rounds. I genuinely believe Usable wouldn't be in the position it is now without them.<p>Getting to revenue ASAP is important (in some cases, it depends on the business obviously), but focusing entirely on that will distract you from opportunities that improve what you're offering in the long term. Ultimately, if you're bootstrapping, most of the time you're focussed on cash-flow, and that means you'll miss some important things. Accelerators are a straightforward way around that issue.<p>Sidenote: The YC thing... YC is amazing because Paul Graham et al are very, <i>very</i> good at picking teams. It's an endorsement from people who really know what they're doing. As the start-up accelerator business grows we'll see similarly trusted recommendations from some of the people choosing teams at other accelerators, and consequently that side of the value will increase. Most accelerators are too new for that to be the case now.",1369899724

As the writer explains, passionate programmers want to get new puzzles all the time and get bored solving old puzzles. This is a very logical process. When somebody got bored with an old puzzle, it means he/she gained more knowledge/experience and has become a better programmer.<p>When you become a better programmer and you notice you're getting bored with your current work, it means you should move on. If your current job doesn't offer you anything more interesting you should get another job.<p>That's my ""remedy"". It would be such a waste if you would say to yourself: ""I shouldn't become a better programmer, I should go on with coding boring stuff and finish my projects"". If you do this you'd better just become a sales person (or something else boring).<p>Of course, it can happen that you have an exiting project but there are some less exiting puzzles in the project that you avoid doing all the time. I think you can easily solve this with project management (indeed, as the writer suggests). If the puzzles aren't that challenging, then the time to solve it won't be very much either.

I should just have said that when it comes to picking a third party framework (I don't always do), I <i>personally</i> prefer the compromises made by Angular than the ones made by Ember. Of course, the biggest compromise of Angular (dirty checking all over the place just to be sure) also make it unsuitable in a number of situations :)<p>About future-proof, I mean the Angular programming model is closer to what we'll be doing in a few years (There won't be any get/set or computed properties anymore); I never implied the Ember team is not aware of what's coming.<p>To me none of the frameworks are ideal, although I find Ember or Angular well architectured, as far as implementing the vision of the authors go. With the current capacities of Js and no compilation steps, compromises can not be avoided :-(",1369898513

The candidate has at least this much in their favor:<p>1. A recruiter has had probably 2-3 phone calls with them, a technical person (or two) has done a phone screen, and they've taken up the time of, say, 4-6 people for in-person interviews.  The company has already spent a not-insignificant amount of time (aka money) evaluating this person, and losing them over a (reasonable) salary increase would be foolish.<p>2. Having evaluated the candidate, the company has decided they want this person to work for them.  Assuming the candidate is great for the position, but the only sticking point is salary, why would the company go back to square 1 to save a little money?  Hiring is hard.<p>Available comp for a particular position is usually a range, and the initial offer will rarely (if ever) quote the top of that range.  If the budget is available, and the candidate is good, whether or not they have a competing offer isn't relevant, unless you <i>know</i> that they'll be forced to take your offer even if you don't budge (which in tech, at least, is pretty rare, I'd think).",1369897492

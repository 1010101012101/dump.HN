I'm learning python, but I'm still deciding if I'll need to learn rails or not.  Is the time it'd take me to learn rails, really saving me time in the long run?  I can do pretty much anything in PHP that could be done in rails.  I'll still look into it though.  I'm not one to jump on a band wagon, but masses of people don't move themselves by just themselves... not all the time.",1178923807
21475,comment,21377,21473,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Can you give one example of a person put in jail or executed for their political views in the US?  One example of government forced censorship?  The difference between the US govt. and the Chinese is more than black and white.  You have the right to disagree with US policies - try complaining about Chinese politcal policies in China and see what happens.  This issue has no gray.<p>The case shown in your posted link is not an example of political persecution against the ISP. We have no information on the reason for the request by the FBI, so I won't speculate. Even with an FBI gag order, the person made the whole case public and went to court.   Try that in China.

21474,comment,21377,21377,0,0,Tichy,,,"While I assume that Google is evil, I am not sure that accepting censorship is actually evil. The alternative would be that Google would not be available at all in China. On the other hand chinese internet surfers are probably aware of the censorship anyway. I think Google acts just like a company trying to do it's job within the constraints of the environment.",1178923766

21464,comment,21316,21451,0,0,mojuba,,,"Ok, so you hope to teach your filter that you are not interested in SEO (because you know that ""decent"" companies rarely advertise themselves by sending spam). What if one day someone you know writes to you personally and offers just friendly to optimize your site because she thinks it doesn't show up in Google results? And let's say there will be some link, too. There's a chance this message will hit the thresholds and you won't see it.<p>Another possibility could be that we are discussing this by email and we use plenty of those ""bad"" words. Now get it: Viagra, Rolex watches, SEO, efficient email advertising ;)<p>I'm arguing that the only way to stop some really shitty mail is to force senders pay some price. Could be money or maybe some computational resources (say, MD5). The <i>recipient</i> (updated) would be able to see exactly how much time or other resources were spent on the given message. The more resources the more important the message. 1000 iterations of MD5? Ok, that must be someone I know personally. 10 iterations? Looks like an ad sent to many recipients. That's it.<p>But computers become more and more powerful. Fine, in 5 years you will be able to raise your thresholds and require, say, 10,000 MD5 iterations to catch your attention.",1178921333

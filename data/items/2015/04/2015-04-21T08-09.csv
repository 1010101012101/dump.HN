Based on that, it looks like it does an excellent job in building up an understanding of how the math works. By the time I looked at SICM, I had implemented my own code to do something similar (coded in Maple). It looked like the progression of the code was well handled. On the whole, I think Lanczos is a better book, but SICM is fairly decent. I&#x27;m also partial to Meirovitch&#x27;s Methods of Analytical Dynamics which I think does the best job of explaining the inclusion of non-conservative forces in the Principle of Least Action. This is needed for applied forces and torques like a motor. It also covers the inclusion of damping forces well.

9412753,comment,9412600,9412641,0,0,exDM69,,,"Lucky you!<p>I play games where using a VR headset is a competitive advantage. Racing sims and flight simulation, combat and aviation. I get quite bad motion sickness from VR (DK1, DK2, both are bad), so I know that within a few years I have no chance of making it in any online multiplayer games.<p>Funnily enough, the first sensations of motion sickness in a flight simulator have a resemblance to what I feel when I go flying in a small aircraft. However, in real life, I get used to it, VR just keeps on getting worse and worse.<p>What makes it worse is that once you stop playing, the VR-induced motion sickness doesn&#x27;t stop. It goes on for hours, bad balance and mild nausea. It gets worse if the lenses in the Rift are a bit off (they must be adjusted for every person), that leaves me incapable of reading or writing for the rest of the day.<p>So yes - it&#x27;s really that big of a problem. If a 30 minute gaming session leaves a significant portion of the customers incapacitated for hours afterwards, there&#x27;s no way you can call it a product and put it on the shelves.<p>BTW, I have high hopes for a competing product in development, the CastAR head mounted projector. It doesn&#x27;t block your view of the real world so it might not cause as bad motion sickness. That also makes it viable for more serious flight simulation where the Oculus is useless because you can&#x27;t see the flight controls (ie. your hands on the gaming controllers).<p><a href=""http://castar.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://castar.com/</a>",1429603503

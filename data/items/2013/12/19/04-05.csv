6932981,comment,6932088,6932728,0,0,fakeanon,,,"Maybe that sounding awkward is a hint to the nature of what you are requesting.\nAnd you think that is how you will request it when the box on computers for existing customers says &quot;I don&#x27;t want Parental Controls&quot;?\nI believe that _____ is wrong, but am reconsidering my opinion on the filter due to to this part: &quot;Paul Goggins (Wythenshawe and Sale East) (Lab): Two weeks ago, the head of the Security Service warned about the extent of Islamist extremism. This week, two individuals have been charged with serious terrorist offences. What is the Prime Minister going to do in January when, as a result of his Government’s legislation, some of those whom the Home Secretary has judged to pose the greatest threat to our security are released from the provisions of their terrorism prevention and investigation measures?<p>The Prime Minister: We have put in place some of the toughest controls that one can possibly have within a democratic Government, and the TPIMs are obviously one part of that. We have had repeated meetings of the extremism task force—it met again yesterday—setting out a whole series of steps that we will take to counter the extremist narrative, including by blocking online sites. Now that I have the opportunity, let me praise Facebook for yesterday reversing the decision it took about the showing of beheading videos online. We will take all these steps and many more to keep our country safe.&quot;. But now that I think about it, is this part of the parental controls filter or something else?<p>Now, take a look at the assertion in &quot;Tackling extremism in the UK&quot;[1]: &quot;1.4 This is a distinct ideology which should not be confused with traditional religious practice. It is an ideology which is based on a distorted interpretation of Islam, which betrays Islam’s peaceful principles, and draws on the teachings of the likes of Sayyid Qutb. Islamist extremists deem Western intervention in Muslim-majority countries as a ‘war on Islam’, creating a narrative of ‘them’ and ‘us’. They seek to impose a global Islamic state governed&quot; I have doubts that Islam is peaceful, but also about censoring websites about even advocating terrorism, and this is at the government level, not a recommendation, but I do not see a problem with an ISP doing it. It seems the article is referring to the government blocking terrorist sites, which I think is a different thing and not the best idea, rather than ISP parental controls, which the article was about. Am I misunderstanding, are these connected more, is the government forcing the blockage of a. immoral but legal sites in the filter or just b. child _____[2], or also c. terrorist sites? Government should only block b, ISP should block b and may provide parental controls to block a and c if they want. But I don&#x27;t quite understand what is going on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-extremism-in-the-uk-report-by-the-extremism-taskforce"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-extremis...</a>\n[2] Seems what the _parental_ filter is implicated for here: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25067051"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25067051</a>",1387429103

People who watch TED and TEDx are quite intelligent.<p>That&#x27;s what they like to think, yes.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about acolytes who watch large numbers of TED talks then yes, most of them very likely know the difference.  Many have probably even attended TEDx events.  But TED talks have spread to far more casual audiences-- people who share merely share the links on twitter and facebook and have probably watched less than 10 talks in their life.<p>> 2. There are no TEDx videos on ted.com, only on subdomain <a href=\"http://tedxtalks.ted.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tedxtalks.ted.com</a>.<p>When I visit that link, I see the large TED logo in the upper left corner (with no &#x27;x&#x27; by it).  While it doesn&#x27;t have the flashy video cloud thing that the main page does, the theme is identical.  Additionally, I do not need to visit the site to watch the talk, TEDx talks are mostly on YouTube.  This talk does not even have the splash page: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDpuJXgD7Rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDpuJXgD7Rs</a><p>Sure it says &quot;TEDx&quot; but how is a casual viewer supposed to know what that means?  How much effort am I really going to devote to the implications of the phrase &quot;independently organized TED event&quot; if I&#x27;m inclined to care at all?<p>> 3. Every TEDx video has this disclaimer: This video was filmed at an independently organized TEDx event and uploaded by the organizer. To flag a video (good or bad!), use this form.<p>I&#x27;ll admit, I did not notice that disclaimer without you pointing it out.  I&#x27;m not sure why, the font is large enough.  Maybe it&#x27;s the light gray text.<p>> So yeah, this was a gross exaggeration.<p>Nobody cares.",1387429060

6932964,comment,6932711,6932899,2,0,jsaxton86,,,"At a previous job, there was a legacy UI application that had a 10,000+ line file called &quot;messloop.c&quot;. It consisted of a function called messloop(), which was an infinite loop with a massive switch statement inside of it. I never had to work on it, but I&#x27;m told it was a maintenance nightmare.<p>So when I read the author&#x27;s code and saw the way he handled a similar problem, I was intrigued. If you had to deal with a massive switch statement with thousands of cases, it would probably be easier to maintain IMHO.<p>For a hobby project, the author&#x27;s solution is 100% correct and I&#x27;m not critiquing it at all. In fact, the only reason I even commented was because I thought his solution was better than any other procedural solution I had seen before.<p>With that said, in an enterprise environment, where maintainability is crucial, I&#x27;d argue that a massive switch statement is probably a bad idea. Going back to messloop.c, what happens if the user tries to change a floating point value through the UI? Well, I can tell you that there is a case statement for that somewhere in messloop.c. What is that case statement called? I&#x27;m not sure, all I know is it&#x27;s a #define that I&#x27;m sure made sense to the original author.

The &quot;transformation language&quot; should be able to understand the following aspects of the original code: its modularity, its test coverage, which parts are functionally pure/impure, which parts are parallel/not, and the full compiler-level semantics of every piece of text in the code (in other words, what JetBrains knows ... this is a local variable name, this is a function name, etc.)<p>In other words, the original language has to capture more of the programmers intent (probably by inferring most of it). The intent-information is mostly or completely unneeded at runtime, but it is VITAL at automated translation time.<p>Imagine having such a codebase, and being able to pull up a REPL and interactively start changing the modularity of the code by issuing commands. Or telling the transformation system to parallelize some portion of code that wasn&#x27;t parallelized previously. Or saying something like, &quot;Take all the code snippets that instantiate the xyz data structure, and change them to call this function instead.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t miss my point -- we have features like this here and there. Some IDE&#x27;s more than others, some languages more than others. Nothing new there. But I&#x27;m talking about a <i>new programming language designed from the ground up to be highly amenable to this kind of interactive, automated transformation</i>. In other words, I think this might be the killer feature that allows one programming language to outcompete most others.<p>This might be the one programming language feature that we should focus on now, more than any other.",1387428069

A new month, will fly by because it is a much shorter time.<p>* To have the same subjective experience of a month passing, an 80 year old would need to spend 6+ years or so (80/12)<p>* To have the same subjective experience as an 80 year old&#x27;s month, a 1 year old would just wait for about half a day to pass by.<p>Totally bogus idea probably, but I was proud of myself for figuring it out on my own back then.",1387427993

Sending out resumes to posted openings - a waste of valuable time.  You find a position you&#x27;re interested in, then you portray yourself as Mr. Whatever that is, because that&#x27;s who they want to hire.  Emailed resume doesn&#x27;t cut it, you gotta get face to face w/a decision maker.<p>Different job requirements, different resume, tailored to those job requirements.  Don&#x27;t lie of course, but you can spin a long way without lying.  Not qualified, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  Someone like you, you&#x27;re smart you&#x27;ll figure it out.  You need to make a good impression and that&#x27;s it.  Acting like you don&#x27;t need their job can be helpful too, but there&#x27;s a way to do it - without coming off the wrong way.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t put too much stock in what a recruiter tells you (or most others for that matter).  Free advice sucks almost all the time (except on HN :), and worse than not helpful it can be harmful.  If I&#x27;d listened to recruiters about what jobs I could and couldn&#x27;t get it would have cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.<p>Best to keep your name off the Interwebs.  You have to control the information flow to the world about yourself.  There&#x27;s services that will help scrub your name off sites, I don&#x27;t know if they work or not, but I can say when you Google yourself, you want the first couple pages to show up exactly what you want to show (or put there yourself).<p>Now view this as a good thing..  Most hiring is mostly completely subjective and based off whether someone likes you or not.  That&#x27;s really what&#x27;s going on.  Eventually someone is going to like you, so you will find a job eventually if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after.",1387426278

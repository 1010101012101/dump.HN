3966871,comment,3960906,3961668,1,0,smithzvk,,,"If you look at the Anonymity page on this wiki, it basically states that being able to generate as many addresses as you want is not much protection.  The coins still need to be transfered between your wallets, and that means people can track whether a wallet has received any funds from an address that has been reported as having stolen coins (after the theft was reported, of course)  In fact, I think it is down right easy to do.<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Anonymity</a><p>I assume that ""tumbler"" is basically as good as any eWallet service with a bit of obfuscation on the transactions in and out.  That is fine, if you trust someone enough to take you coins, mix them with a bunch on other peoples money, and then send them back to when you need them, you can remain pretty anonymous.  This is because that person/organization can do virtual funds transfers off of the bitcoin block chain record.  However, in the scenario where address are marked as dirty or clean, that eWallet supplier is going to find him/herself in the possession of many dirty bitcoins and will have to burn them.<p>In the Silk Road example, if people use stolen bitcoins on that network, all bitcoins that get sent in are tainted by that (to some percentage) and the value of the entire working volume of Silk Road bitcoins in the ""tumbler"" laundering machine is lessened.  This means that either Silk Road passes that loss of value on to the sellers, possibly pissing them off, or they throw those bitcoins away (or send them back) and tell the person paying with them to pay again from a clean address because that money was reported as stolen.",1336913854

Perhaps having some background information about what exactly he's working on might have helped.<p>On a second read, it looks like the meat of the post is about decoupling the implementation of your API from the underlying network protocol. Unless I'm missing something, that would be MVC.<p>Controllers are completely oblivious to the fact that HTTP is being used behind the scene. The routing mechanism takes care of parsing the request, deserializing the request body, instantiating the appropriate controller and invoking the correct action passing the deserialized objects as parameters. Once the controller's action has completed and returned its result, the View is responsible for serialising the response to HTML, JSON, XML or whatever serialisation format you use, and for setting the correct HTTP status code and headers.<p>So still puzzled, even after a second read.",1336913818

3966867,comment,3966187,3966187,34,0,nkoren,,,"Meanwhile, in America, not only is there no national tracking of firearm discharges -- there's no national tracking of <i>how many people are killed by police</i>.[1] The FBI tracks ""justifiable homicides"" by police -- which seems to range from 350 to 400 per year[2], and is limited to ""The killing of a felon by a peace officer in the line of duty""[3] -- but it explicitly refuses to track all <i>other</i> killings by the police. (And rather strangely, there seems to be no private group which tracks these figures either. When I've googled for it in the past, I've found anecdotal stories claiming that groups which attempt to compile these figures are <i>strongly discouraged</i> from doing so. But now I can't seem to find those claims, however.) News reports of the shootings of unarmed non-fellons would suggest to me that there are a few score such killings every year, but there's no way to be sure.<p>Moral of the story: Germany is a profoundly civilised country.

3966865,comment,3966007,3966007,5,0,PaulHoule,,,"Memory consumption for code isn't usually a big issue these days -- at least if you're programming on a mainstream computer or well-powered tablet.  (Memory consumption of data keeps me up at night,  but that's another issue.)<p>I've seen that some people are concerned about webapp memory consumption,  and that might be very real for CGI scripts (I remember memory being primary in 1999),  but working with PHP,  Java and ASP.NET,  I see code size as a secondary concern.  Facebook developed HipHop because CPU time really is the bottleneck with PHP;  and I can say that when I need to upgrade a busy PHP box it's nowhere near running out of memory.<p>Now there are embedded systems,  and sometimes there it's worth making radical efforts to shoehorn things.

3966859,comment,3965753,3966039,3,0,elemeno,,,"Both the banality and the salary differ to a fairly large extent depending on where in the financial world you are, or what area of a bank you're in.<p>I'll start by acknowledging that I've got biases since I've spent my career in finance, so the following is my opinion based on what I've seen so far.<p>Firstly, the big money software roles tend to be in Hedge Funds and Prop Firms, the culture of which (especially if they're smaller) is very start-up like. Long hours, often stressful, often full of rapid pivots as traders change their mind, markets change or management alters course. A lot of smart people some of whom come with big egos but they generally know their stuff.<p>Alternatively, in a bank the money tends to be good if you're working for a trading desk in a Front Office role, or working with Quant groups. In those roles you're generally seen as a business function (i.e. you help them make money) rather than a technology function (i.e. you cost them money). You get the same long hours and stress as above especially if anything goes wrong or the markets are going crazy - keeping the desk trading and the pricing right come above all else.<p>Risk can also come with good money - when you're software is used to analyse the performance of several billion dollars worth of trades, they're willing to pay to make sure it's done right.<p>All the above is likely going to be a mix of C++ and .Net depending on which side of runs-fast or develops-fast a project comes down on. Often numerical libraries will be in C++ and the rest of the project in .Net since interop between the two is pretty easy. In hedge funds especially there might be some language-de-jour as well, I've run into Scala, Python, K and OCaml at various funds. If you're with a banking quant group, there might well be F# there as well.<p>A lot of the problems in those roles are going to revolve around Maths (pricing, analytics), high availability (you don't really want your trading platform to crash), big data (teasing information out of databases with millions of ticks per day) and working with real time data (if your pricing is a second out of sync with the markets, expect to lose money) - all of which I consider to be interesting problems to work on, and far more interesting than the work at a lot of start ups I've heard about, although the atmosphere is probably fairly similar.<p>Now if you're working in the back office... that's where I might expect to find Java and Banality!",1336913478

In fact you face a couple significant risks that increase the longer you're there.<p>First, the founders may sense your lack of ""enthusiasm"" and realize that your chances of leaving are high. To protect the company's reputation from the public vote of no confidence implicit in your quitting, they may decide to take the initiative and fire you. Yes, this type of behavior is underhanded but it's more common than you may think. Imagine trying to explain to a hiring manager that you were fired because you planned to quit. Unfortunately, no one will believe you.<p>Second, you're part of a sinking ship and as the tech lead there's no way to separate your reputation from it. The longer you stay, the longer you expose your personal brand to the failure at large.<p>My last advice is the most important because it should guide all of your career decisions. Do not let fear suppress your better judgement. Step back from the reasons you listed for staying at the company and you'll realize that fear is the commonality. Fear isn't your friend.

If they were <i>really</i> well-connected, you'd probably have funding... and VCs with an active interest in getting users for the product. Well-connected means that VCs who don't fund you will mentor you until you are fundable. It means that you can get TechCrunch coverage with a phone call. That's what ""well connected"" means.<p>Too many people sell themselves as being ""well connected"" when they aren't. 99.9 percent of us (and 99.99 percent of the smart ones) are peasant people who don't have that kind of access that would merit having a non-technical founder.<p>There is an alternate strategy to the ""leave now"" advice that you are getting. I'm going to explore it just for the sake of doing so, although the default advice of ""quit now"" stands. <i>If</i> these founders are well-connected, they can prove it. Ask to go to investor meetings and the various other high-society shindigs they attend to keep up their connections. They might as well, because it sounds like they're not paying you. If they do so, then you can evaluate for yourself whether they're well-connected enough to merit staying in this long-shot startup (and you can make connections yourself). Sitting in on the investor meetings will also give you a voice in technical decisions because you'll have your own perspective on the business needs.<p>Chances are, they'll say no.

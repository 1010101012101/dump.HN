Then you get a fourth buddy in and promote the third one and so on. The system ends once the group has too many people at a high position. At that point any new employee joining the company at a low position is screwed, probably. Also at this point infighting will probably break out from people who don&#x27;t want to split their raises with the ones with less money, given that they don&#x27;t have a way of advancing any further.

6713939,comment,6713065,6713510,4,0,martian,,,"There is a lot of negative commentary on this thread (thanks HN for always providing such valuable feedback), but I&#x27;d like to point out what I think is useful and positive with Prime.<p>First, health <i>is</i> inherently social. When you&#x27;re sick, do you tell your loved one (boy/girlfriend, spouse, parent, close friends, etc?). Of course you do. You want them to know that you might need their care for a few days, that you might have to miss some events that you&#x27;d planned together, that you might need help going to the pharmacy to pick up some meds, etc. More serious health issues are even more social. Name one person you know who has suffered from a severe medical condition who has <i>not</i> told their loved ones. When my close family and friends are ill or going in for checkups that are potentially not routine, I want to know immediately what happened. If my loved one were to be drastically ill, I would want to know everything about their condition, the test results, the doctors&#x27; reports, the latest research, etc. Surely the HN community understands the desire to geek out over knowledge (health knowledge) and Prime aids that.<p>Furthermore, I recently suffered some major personal health issues. When I was in the midst of a flurry of doctors visits and medical procedures, my family and friends were all very curious to know what was happening and if they could help out, etc. I was already exhausted by the doctors&#x27; visits, and sharing the result of every test and exam with dozens of people was really straining for me. I was extremely lucky to have people near me who could assist me in spreading the word to the people who cared, but this whole &quot;sharing information&quot; problem would have been perfectly solved with Prime. I intentionally did not share any of my health information on Facebook, because I didn&#x27;t trust Facebook&#x27;s data privacy and sharing policies. While health is social, it&#x27;s still private. But Prime may solve this.<p>For more routine procedures, I can see Prime being very useful. Did my elderly grandmother get her flu shot yet? Check. What was the result of my father&#x27;s latest checkup about his cholesterol level? Easy to know.<p>Beyond &quot;social&quot;, Prime provides centralized repo for all your medical data. Remember Mint? Remember how everyone gave up their bank passwords to a web-based service so they could see pretty charts and better budget and manage their finances? Remember how Mint took that information and sold ads and upsells against it? Yeah. Right. That&#x27;s what is happening with medical data, too. Someone (Prime, perhaps) is going to be the one to collect all this information in one place, make it easy to read and understand, and become &quot;the Mint of health data&quot;. I would bet on this. The world of health data is too fragmented to not be consolidated sometime soon.<p>The issues Prime faces are not small: first, ingesting data, and second, earning their users&#x27; trust.<p>I wish them the best of luck.",1384203118

This isn&#x27;t going to work long term, and they&#x27;re going to flip the tables. How? I have no idea, but here&#x27;s an example.<p>Developers set the global price for their game. They can also set a unique price per store. All sales go through Steam, referral codes send a commission back to the store making the sale. For example, you&#x27;re a developer with a game on Steam, $9.99, and you want to sell it on the Humble Store for a 24 hour sale, at $4.99. You set the Steam pricing coming from the Humble referral links at a 50% discount. Now, users browse the Humble Store, see the game at 50% off, click to buy, and get forwarded to Steam, or go through a Humble checkout that uses the Steam API. Valve takes the money, distributes a percent to the developer, and a commission to Humble. If Humble wants to send a part of their payment to charity, that&#x27;s up to them.<p>Valve wants to encourage more user stores selling Steam games in the coming year. I imagine a new payment system will be announced in mid/late 2014 to accompany these changes.",1384202853

(The handy thing here is my hackintosh build runs the vanilla kernel and I patch all my kexts at runtime so all the binaries are stock -- thus the backups are portable).  This is my workstation and it&#x27;s primarily a single-user system but there is the occasional remote user login.  I use this same setup on all my macs though, and this is how it works:<p><pre><code>   1 60GB SSD for the OS, applications, and caches\n   X number of SSDs (usually 256GB), one for each user\n   </code></pre>\nThe 60GB OS SSD is filevaulted with a password known to all users, so the disk is FDE&#x27;d while any of us can boot it.  Each user SSD is filevault encrypted with their personal key.  Each user is assigned a bash alias to mount their drive (So you can paste keys if you&#x27;re using pubkeys with secure entry):<p><pre><code>       maroch=&#x27;diskutil cs unlockVolume <logicalvolumeid>&#x27; ##mount aroch&#x27;s home directory\n</code></pre>\nAnd there&#x27;s the associated fstab entry<p><pre><code>    /Volumes/aroch /Users/aroch hfs rw,bind 0 0\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;root&quot; account is an admin account setup much the same way but but it is just an encrypted DMG and is mounted at boot using launchd and a hardware dongle as the password.  If no dongle is present, there&#x27;s a non-admin account with a real homedir that can also be used to elevate into an admin shell<p>The 60GB backup SSD (in slot #4): An install of (now) OSX Mavericks that includes my standard set of homebrew installs, xcode and the ~20 applications I use daily + Arq.  It also has the a backup of my fstab and the root account DMG. There&#x27;s a daily cron that copies my personal dotfiles to it as well.  There&#x27;s a weekly cron that reboots the workstation into the backup SSD and there&#x27;s a startup script on the backup SSD that checks for system updates /MAS updates, applies them, Arq backup (Takes ~10mins usually) and then reboots back into the main OS SSD.  The files total about 17GB right now but the delta is usually less than 100mb.<p>If needed, the OS and settings can be restored with Arq by using the backup SSD&#x27;s vault",1384202295

A fully-normalized database is a space-efficient representation of some data model which can be queried reasonably efficiently from any angle with a bit of careful indexing.<p>Of course relational databases being a hedge, are not optimal for anything.  For any particular data access pattern there&#x27;s probably an easy way to make it faster using x or y nosql data store.  However as the article points out, before you decide to go that route you better be pretty certain that you know exactly how you are going to use your data today and for all time.  You also should probably have some pretty serious known scalability requirements otherwise it could be premature optimization.<p>Neither of these things are true for a startup, so I&#x27;d say startups should definitely stay away from Mongo unless they really know what they are doing.  Being ignorant of SQL and attracted by the &quot;flexibility&quot; of schema-less data stores powered by javascript is definitely the wrong reason to look at Mongo.",1384201944

6713648,comment,6712703,6713072,11,0,JangoSteve,,,"> Until you want some analytics.<p>I can actually respond to this specifically, as we recently had a project that needed us to build some decently-sized and complex analytics into their app. I spent about a month researching how most analytics solutions are structured and work, and became very familiar with the codebase for FnordMetric, which is one such open-source analytics solution.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t initially think it (I certainly didn&#x27;t), but Mongo is actually a <i>great</i> use-case for analytics data. Here&#x27;s why...<p>Most analytics platforms don&#x27;t query live-data and build reports on the fly. It&#x27;s terribly inefficient and doesn&#x27;t scale. If something like Google Analytics did this, it&#x27;d take forever for your Analytics dashboard to load, especially at their scale.<p>What most analytics platforms do, is they know before-hand what data you want to aggregate and at what granularity, and they perform calculations (such as incrementing a counter) and then store the result in a separate analytics database/table. In fact, there are several presentations and articles about doing things like this with Mongo:<p><a href=""http://blog.mongohq.com/first-steps-of-an-analytics-platform-with-mongodb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mongohq.com/first-steps-of-an-analytics-platform...</a><p><a href=""http://www.10gen.com/presentations/mongodb-analytics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.10gen.com/presentations/mongodb-analytics</a><p><a href=""http://blog.tommoor.com/post/24059620728/realtime-analytics-at-buffer-with-mongodb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.tommoor.com/post/24059620728/realtime-analytics-...</a><p>And then, this is an interesting article that discusses the difference between processing data into buckets on the way in, and creating an analytics platform that does more ad-hoc processing on the way out:<p><a href=""http://devsmash.com/blog/mongodb-ad-hoc-analytics-aggregation-framework"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devsmash.com/blog/mongodb-ad-hoc-analytics-aggregatio...</a><p>Let&#x27;s take something as simple as aggregate pageviews for example (for simplicity&#x27;s sake, we&#x27;ll say you want total pageviews for your app, not per-page). Normally you&#x27;d think, simple, I&#x27;ll just store my pageview events, and then when I want to view pageviews, I&#x27;ll issue a `COUNT` command on the database. Even this gets terribly slow, for a couple reasons:<p>* You may just have a <i>ton</i> of pageview event entries to query.<p>* Each pageview has a datetime-stamp, and you have to query not just one `COUNT` query for a given time-range; rather, your analytics dashboard needs to show a graph of counts over time, e.g. pageviews per day for the last week, or pageviews per week for the last year or pageviews per hour for the past day, etc. Each of these would require several distinct COUNT queries (or one more-complex GROUP query), which is even slower, especially for large datasets.<p>So generally, analytics platforms will have different aggregate buckets for pageviews in the database, which each keep a different granular tally. For example, I&#x27;d have a bucket for each day, which keeps tally for pageviews that day, and a bucket for each week, which tallies pageviews for that week, etc. When a pageview comes in, they&#x27;ll increment each bucket (which is a really fast process with Mongo, since it actually has an `INC` command (aka UPSERT) which can easily increment multiple buckets with one really fast query.<p>So why is Mongo pretty good for analytics? Because 1) each time-interval bucket is a silo of data for that time-interval, and 2) usually analytics are for patterns and aggregate data, so they don&#x27;t normally require extremely high reliability (i.e. it&#x27;s usually okay if an event is dropped here or there).<p>Of course neither #1 or #2 above are always the case, so this doesn&#x27;t always apply, but my point was just that Mongo is actually a better fit for analytics than you might imagine.",1384200504

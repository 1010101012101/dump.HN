I wonder if they do, or could, take usage stats into account as well as ratings.

Is that too much to ask?</i><p>If Google had a maps app, it wouldn't be too much to ask. Google doesn't have a maps app; iOS has a maps app, which was powered by Google up until iOS 6. If/when Google creates a maps app, I'm willing to bet Apple will approve it for the App Store, just as they've approved Chrome and Gmail.<p>Apple's contract to use Google as the back-end data source for iOS's Maps app expired and, for all we know, <i>Google</i> refused to renegotiate another contract. I doubt that's the case, but anyone asserting anything either way is simply speculating unless they're sourcing from someone at Apple or Google.",1348126214

Admittedly a huge chunk of my problem is having purchased an expensive program purporting to teach me how to get rich and find my dream job.  If I didn't have a four-figure debt due to that (and another few hundred bucks due each month), I'd have a lot less stress.<p>One thing that I have found is that while it's a tough job market for fulltime work, companies are a lot less conservative about hiring people on a freelance basis.  Non-tech companies have been an especially bet for me.  Many restaurants, bars, independent realtors, are making money and haven't updated their sites in a long time.  It's been a <i>very</i> slow process but I have gradually been getting better and better referrals from it.  When I bid, I generally take 20-40% up front.  For someone in your situation, that could make a big difference.",1348124893

Secondly a good response is going to be pretty detailed, since you've touched on a huge topic.<p>Technology has moved faster than legislation. Which is fine and expected. The technology brings up intricate questions which take time to answer, let alone decide on what/how/if something is to be legislated.<p>Thats the part which is relevant to the original discussion. Technology may leap ahead, it doesn't mean that legal understanding wont catch up and be good at it drawing the line.<p>--------------<p>A more detailed response on your assertion that Zynga is a 21st century drug dealer. While I think social games do raise some important and concerning issues, I think the responses will fall short of the distance you travel.<p>Zynga's games, and a large group of social games for example; are cute skinner boxes. I don't see how legislating against that aspect will be viable.<p>At most I can see rules laid down to ensure that the slot machine/random aspect of it, has some clear cut pay out schemes that must be enforced.<p>Nor do I see how I can make a case where "".. are designed to turn people into clicking-addicted machines."" Its a skinner box. People have an ancient immunity to things like this, namely boredom.<p>Over time, people get bored and drift away. Witness the share price of Zynga and dropping engagement rates.<p>I've also played with, and worked alongside a lot of those psychologically vulnerable members of society - they've all pretty much gone on to kick the 'habit' or manage it like entertainment.<p>I've also been looking at data or articles that come out on internet addiction and gaming addiction; most people can barely agree that this is a condition. Only a few people are categorized as being victims, compared to the large number of people who play video games or use the net.",1348124884

If your team pays more attention to your presence than the work they are doing, there is a problem.  You need to be able to get people's attention, but they shouldn't pay attention to whether you are in their peripheral vision.<p>2. There is a short path from worrying about whether you are ""in the loop"" to micromanaging.  A micromanager may feel that they are doing lots of stuff and contributing value (because hey, that effort has to be worth something) but they are wrong.<p>3. A manager who is more concerned with the presentation of employees than what they are actually doing has the wrong priorities.  At least if you're managing people in IT.",1348124643

4547409,comment,4547179,4547289,5,0,unhammer,,,"For me it was a combination of things. For one, I use emacs and a Norwegian keyboard layout, and Apple handily ensures that '\' is only possible to type using both shift, option and 7. Now, since I'm an emacs user, typing meta+\ should mean command+option+shift+7. As if that wasn't bad enough, I never found a way to configure neither Terminal.app nor iTerm2 or whatever it's called such that I could get both option functionality and a meta key (perhaps this has been fixed later? been a couple years), so when ssh-ing I had to use esc, then option+shift+7.<p>Combine this with how difficult it is to get a real dev environment set up, on debian-based systems you just apt-get install build-essential etc., similarly on Arch Linux, whereas on a Mac it was installing that whole XCode from a CD which included a bunch of stuff I never needed, then waiting for hours for macports to compile gcc etc. (I never understood why macports didn't go with precompiled binaries, mac's are so uniform compared to linuxes it should be _easier_, shouldn't it?). And then waiting for hours every time gcc etc. got an update, thinking ""I thought I did this already, what is this, gentoo?"" And the annoyance of having to install GNU sed and ensure it was before OS X sed in PATH because OS X sed was horribly slow on certain regexes (I think they had a \1 in them, can't remember), it felt so  inelegant.<p>And most of the projects I use and like working on just seemed to have better Linux support; of course I could rant about how OS X is a POSIX too and they should support it just as well as Linux, but, well, I chose convenience.

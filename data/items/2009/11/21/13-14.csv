You are correct, apple isn't selling users the software on the devices, they are licensing it, and the terms of that license likely stipulates that users have no right to the code (I don't know for sure, because I've never read the license, even as I type this from my iPhone).<p>In this case the license isn't the issue. The court isn't bound by the license, and if it deems it necessary for evidentiary purposes, over and above any objections Apple raises, then it will order Apple to turn over the code.",1258811777

(coincidentally, I've been taking it for the last 3 weeks) So non-poor people who live in affected regions can't keep on taking it either and therefore can and do catch malaria. It is treatable if caught early enough (I guess this is your poverty angle?) but anything but pleasant even if treatment is successful. Moreover, once you've had it, it can come back anytime during the rest of your life, rich or poor.<p>Of course, that makes it no less of a problem, and curing it once and for all would certainly be prizeworthy.",1258811488

954519,comment,954273,954408,0,0,tom_b,,,"My best guess is that most online players are now ""augmented,"" using at least PokerTracker (hands played databases) with HUDs (heads-up displays that overlay the game window and provide some significant statistical info based on mining hands and odds calculations without player input).  I believe, based on what I've read at 2+2 and other sites that even small limit games (say 25/50 cent limit hold'em) are mostly played by players with these tools.<p>I stopped playing at smaller games almost two years ago because I became convinced I was playing more bots than people - in spite of the fact that I was winning and continuing to build bankroll, I wasn't interested in entering the arms race that I saw the software requiring.<p>The game sites have a strong incentive to not put in too many safeguards against software automation - they take a small portion of each pot on each hand at a table.  The majority of players using software to augment their play during a game are multi-tabling, thus more games/hands = more money for the sites.<p>I had an interesting exchange with the support staff at one online site, where I was arguing that the simplest thing they could do to discourage data mining was to allow players to use another screen name during sessions as an option.  They shot me down pretty quickly.<p>Even though gathering statistically significant info about a specific opponent requires a prohibitively large number of hands (more than 10K?), most people on HN are highly aware of how we can build algorithms that classify data pretty easily with limited info.  By simply deciding that most players fall into a relatively small set of classes, you can probably grab enough info to be positive EV against a new opponent in a relatively small number of hands - this is what you do as a player, but I really feel that adding a software tool to do it tarnishes the game.  It makes it a little like playing chess against an opponent sitting there with a laptop with a chess playing program - really the program is what you're playing  The human opponent is really just a complicated interface.<p>But I miss the game, it's a great way to stretch your brain differently than hacking.",1258810141

""One post wonders"" and similar tend to be viewed with suspicion.  Even if you could get past that, such queries sent to multiple forums would practically be guaranteed to violate cultural expectations of one or more of the forums to which it was forwarded.  The only way this would work would be if you had a staff who made it their business to belong to a bunch of different forums, be in good standing in those forums, and know how to rephrase any questions sent them so it meets cultural expectations of the various forums.  This is already done informally when someone like me says ""Hey, if you want, I can ask around and let you know what I find out, if anything.""",1258809786

At 2,000 dollars for open heart surgery it's still a lot but at least considerably more affordable.  What will be interesting/exciting to see is how well they do at their facility in the Caymans and whether US insurers will cover the cost of treatments there.  Ambulatory surgical centers have a record of greater outputs but also better outcomes than their generalist competitors.  This is pretty compelling - (and at $2,000!):<p>""Dr. Shetty's success rates appear to be as good as those of many hospitals abroad.

However, price has always been related to scarcity, and if there is no control of the same, the offer gets commoditized , hence the real and perceived value is not appropriate. The book Experience Economy talks a lot about this.<p>EDIT: In any case, the one that is concerned with fair value  has a sustainable advantage over the one that is looking for ripping off customers. Dynamic pricing should involve many variables, such as time since marketed, total sales, stock, discounting, revisions etc, but I would keep all of this information out of the sight of customers as it may appear very confusing and irritating for the conservative ones.<p>I am not sure whether they are doing it right here, but I have great respect for experimenting.

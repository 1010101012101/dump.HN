There's no over-arching justice to ensure that just because someone beats be at one thing they won't beat me at another.  Nature as a whole has no sense of fair play.  The best you can do is get on with life.<p>Having said that, if you treat people well you often find that their sense of fair play gives you a safety net.<p>But always remember:<p><pre><code>    ""Life is pain, highness. Anyone who tells you\n    differently is selling something.""\n \n        â€” William Goldman (The Princess Bride)\n</code></pre>\nADDED IN EDIT: I've just been checking - although the line is in the film, it's not in the book.",1281095964

Make rice and lentils, chop a tomato and an onion, fry an egg: congratulations, you just ate a full, healthy meal for less than $2. Time wasted: approximately 10 minutes.<p>Even better: take turns cooking for the team. 5 people, 20 minutes of work: you're down to 4 wasted minutes per person. That's less than you need to <i>walk</i> to Jack in the box.",1281095695

1580788,comment,1580270,1580515,0,0,kls,,,"There was also WAIS, which was interesting in it own respect. you would open ""databases"" across the net and search for info that you where interested in. A lot of counterculture stuff was available as well as a lot of good programming documents. The process got pretty cumbersome after the net expanded past the universities and government establishments. It did not scale well.<p>To the GP poster. I can remember a time before the net (it seems like yesterday) and back then we had local BBS services that some tech guy, in the local community, usually ran. There where also some regional and national BBS networks. They would advertise them in the back of DR. Dobb's and some of the other computer hobbyist magazines.<p>In some ways, that was a cooler time to be into computing, everything was new, everything was exclusive because it took some technical know how to get onto these networks. Small things where groundbreaking developments back then. Computers where slow so you had to be resourceful and creative when developing.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love where we have come, but back then there was a sense of being part of a revolution, it may just have been because, I was a little younger than you are now, but it seemed so much more fascinating back then.",1281095635

I think one of the advantages of such a situation is superior communication due to years and years of practice/context.  My sons want to found a company together.  They blow my mind with the way they work cooperatively, sometimes without saying a word, just because they both know what the other will do.  So I can readily imagine this dynamic in other situations, assuming the brothers have a good, solid relationship.  (Another truism being that most murders are committed by someone close to you, such as a blood relative, lover, or business partner.)",1281095035

1580772,comment,1578524,1578524,0,0,chuhnk,,,"I was excited to see a new movement in database schemes that provide a different way of storing data outside a relational database model however a couple things bother me. Firstly calling it nosql, its just complete disrespect of sql and relational databases, could there not have been a more mature response and have it termed as something relevant?<p>Secondly what scares me and I find hilarious is people who so quickly jump onto this movement, moving the entirety of their critical data without understanding the potential downfalls, such as data loss with no warning. As a key value store for non critical data, this kind of thing is brilliant, and data loss can be managed, maybe not tolerated in a high throughput environment where ""cache misses"" are a concern but otherwise yea its great. Still look at facebook, twitter, friendfeed, who are all still using mysql and scaling out in their own way.",1281094363

1580763,comment,1580144,1580719,0,0,toumhi,,,"I lived in Austin itself, and I would consider many of the roads seriously dangerous. There are no really roads meant to accommodate bikers, only roads for cars (Anderson Mill Road and Parmer Lane come to mind). The stupid thing, from a biker point of view, is that even if you try to bike on smaller roads, at some point you are forced to join a big road. Also, since urban planning didn't take into account alternative modes of transportation, the distance to bike is ironically much longer than if you take your car(in Europe it's usually the contrary since you can bike on all roads, so it reduces the distance). So, I really see biking as transportation strongly discouraged there. Big up to Austinites who ride their bike though!",1281093927

From a financier's standpoint, is it a good thing to have one's own brother (or sister, as the case may be) involved in a venture?<p>I figure, on the one hand the brother can't really bail (and you can't really bail) since you can't ""escape your own blood"". So when times get rough, the probability is high the core team will stick through. But there's also another saying, by which you ""can't choose your family but you can choose your friends"".<p>Whether you can make it work or not probably really depends on your specific family bonds and compatibility.

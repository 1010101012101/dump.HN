5990884,comment,5989288,5989288,0,0,dkarl,,,"Warning:  this comment gets very silly, because I think the story here is actually a very silly one, and can only be understood with a sense of humor.  Yes, I&#x27;m gonna go against my hippie liberal leanings and say this story is probably mostly harmless.  I believe that the plan to &quot;engage in sniper attacks against protestors (sic) in Houston, Texas if deemed necessary&quot; was formulated for the contingency when Occupy threatened to undermine government authority altogether, plunging the United States into anarchy.  Because we know what happens next:  a coup, followed by fragmentation into various regional governments, which in turn become subsumed in a race war as patriot groups and groups of parasitic degenerates battle to define the foundations on which civilization is rebuilt.<p>This is not an uncommon fantasy.  Most people who are into guns are content to enjoy them for sport, as objects, and for limited self-defense scenarios, but a few like to have one or more elaborate fantasies for every exotic gun they own in which that gun becomes eminently practical.  So some guy works for a police department that has some suppressed sniper rifles (thanks, War on Terror!) and naturally gets to thinking about the heroic ways he could use them to save the world by averting a horrible catastrophe.  He knows it&#x27;s all bullshit, but it&#x27;s still a potent fantasy enabler.<p>It&#x27;s no different from when you think about your hot sister-in-law, and you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;Oooh, yeah, she&#x27;s so goddamned hot, I would just... wait, I would never do that to my brother.  Well, supposing my brother died in a car accident.  I would totally bend... wait, that would destroy my marriage.  Okay, so my wife and my brother are in a car together on one of those dangerous mountain roads in South America, and it goes careening off a cliff... no, a <i>bus</i> containing everyone in my family <i>except</i> my sister-in-law goes careening off a cliff on the way to Lake Titicaca, and then we would console each other, and then, ooooh, yeah, so hot.&quot;<p>Except instead of a bus accident, you have Occupy undermining government authority, and instead of your hot sister in law, you have hot, hot, sexy firearms.  Boom-chicka wow.  I mean, it&#x27;s never going to happen, but let&#x27;s face it, you&#x27;re only ever going to get the old familiar, and you get that, what, once a year?  <i>If</i> all the stars align correctly, that is.  And at your age, it takes a little more than the old familiar to get you remotely excited anyway.  Your fantasies are all you have left.  Put one such dreamer in a police department, and I&#x27;m sure some weird contingency plans get drawn up.",1372949683

On the other spectrum, the type of people going to fast food every day think of Subway as a healthy choice and therefore when most people choose McDonalds, its not for a healthy food choice, but more for the indulgence. So while the McWrap might be a significant addition to McDonalds menu, the Double Cheeseburger, French Fries and Big Macs will continue to reign supreme.<p>-EDIT-\nFor those arguing  that they can eat healthy at McDonalds, I really strongly recommend reconsidering your nutrition plan. I didn&#x27;t want to go there with this comment, I was trying to make the point that a healthy dieter won&#x27;t opt for McDonalds, but people have seemed to want to argue that they can and apparently do eat healthy at McDonalds. Thats cool with me, but if you have fitness/bodyweight goals to achieve, best to stick with food directly from the farm.

Disclosing a vulnerability in this public manner and providing a decryption tool on a platter has probably done more damage to the hypothetical journalists who were hypothetically using CryptoCat.<p>I don&#x27;t think bad crypto should be forgiven, but it would be easier and probably less arrogant to just submit a diff / pull request publicly that fixes all of the problems that the author observed, and then have people comment upon it.

[...] In my opinion, the situation is not much different in Python, Java or C++.</i><p>I think the problem is a mix of language features and culture.  Ruby does not have a history good thread-safe practices, and the language has some extremely convenient features which are death for thread-safety (eg. class instance variables).  Combine that with prolific meta-programming and a lack of static analysis tools, and it can become very very difficult to be certain that a given application is thread safe.  As long as all developers are well-versed and keep thread-safety front and center from the beginning of application developer then I agree it&#x27;s not hard per se, but in practice that is so rarely the case that if I knew I needed heavy multi-threading for memory efficiency and CPU utilization I might disqualify Ruby on cultural reasons alone (and I say this as a full-time rubyist who knows no language better).",1372949223

He likely wouldn&#x27;t have announced the same remarks in real life, yet he and many others like him, do so online. It&#x27;s like they forget that conversations on Facebook and Twitter are not private.<p>That all said, it&#x27;s still not right that these kids are detained for so long based on such circumstantial evidence (and that&#x27;s overstating the weight of evidence, if these articles are to be believed verbatim) is a clear abuse of justice. Kids say stupid things. As adults we might cringe, but many of us were the same when we were teenagers. So locking someone up based on a stupid comment is complete unacceptable.<p>edit: just to clear up a few points because I think some have misunderstood me:<p>1) The comments in question were posted publicly on Facebook. It wasn&#x27;t a PM - it was a public message. This is why I stated that the teenager in question likely wouldn&#x27;t have made those comments in the same way in real life (ie he wouldn&#x27;t stand in the middle of a busy town center and announce the same comments at the top of his voice for all to hear).<p>2) I appreciate the comments were a &quot;joke&quot; and it&#x27;s not the content of the message that offended me (far from it - I have quite a dark sense of humour myself). It was the fact that he publicly announced his comments that I thought was stupid. You have no idea who might misunderstand public comments (case in point, me having to make clarifications in this post) - and this is particularly dangerous with darker jokes where others might -at best- be offended, but at worse, miss the point entirely. This isn&#x27;t about censorship, it&#x27;s about respecting your audience (ie keep the darker jokes private where your friends -who understand and share your humour- can enjoy).<p>3) I&#x27;m not blaming the teenager (or not exclusively anyway). I think what has happened to him is completely and utterly unacceptable. However I do think he was wrong for posting those comments to begin with. This is one of those instances where several parties are in the wrong.<p>I hope this clarifies a few things :)",1372949002

They didn&#x27;t operate in a climate of such overwhelming political apathy that allowing military forces to operate domestically, seize people off the street, and throw them in a hole, <i>forever</i>, generates little more than an online petition and a few calls to Congress.<p>In short, we are <i>orders of magnitude</i> less free than we have ever been, simply by virtue of the incomprehensible power of the federal government. Just because they have not deigned to exercise it on a large scale (up till now), doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t, or won&#x27;t. It just means they haven&#x27;t needed to (yet). As is the case on many topics, I believe Frank Zappa summed it up best:<p>The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it&#x27;s profitable to continue the illusion.

It&#x27;s an effort to silence dissent and once the people can&#x27;t easily and effectively communicate, then organized protests become very difficult... Which is part of the goals and plans.<p>Edit: vague statutes and regulations allow for prosecutor discretion and overreach. We need to wipe the books... We have way too many &quot;laws&quot;.",1372947723

5990671,comment,5988615,5989003,1,0,arpineh,,,"I don&#x27;t see that web platform&#x27;s developers chose to reinvent anything. I would put the blame to Microsoft and other closed system makers of 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s which prevented development of cross platform applications for open content production and consuming. Thus everything OS&#x27;s can do (and did even in 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s), needs to be re-implemented in the browsers, in aggreement. This too has taken a long time for precisely same reasons: companies waging war over platforms to lock users in, embracing and extending fledgling standards.<p>Web development tools are the best we can use these days <i>if</i> we want to reach the broadest audience, benefit from each others experience and further enchance the platform. Other tools make us choose one walled garden where development is rosy and ideas old, all the while hoping it stays alive long enough. I hope web can do what Engelbart&#x27;s system did in 1968, but this time as open source, documented, findable and usable by every user with every device connected to the same truly global network.",1372946772

It&#x27;ll be a game with the same characters, environments, story and basic gameplay, but the feel of it will be completely different.<p>I run a FFVII-based fansite (thelifestream.net, [/plug]), and the general consensus of the community there is that while a full FFVII remake would be nice, it would generally be criticized by the original fanbase, no matter how awesome they make it, simply because it&#x27;s not the same game anymore.<p>For an example of the only full-on remake Square ever did of one of their older titles, you could look at FFIII on the DS, remaking a 2d, sprite-based game into a 3D one. Of course, FFIII doesn&#x27;t have nearly the fanbase of VII so there were less tears on the internet over it.",1372946706

Although I usually wouldn&#x27;t do that, I am not entirely sure whether one <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> do that. For example Unicorn is multi-proces single-threaded so it should never be used without a buffering web server, but Puma is different.

I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve never had dental problems and every time I go to a dentist and he suggests to remove my wisdom teeth, I change to another dentist.<p>These teeth exist for a reason, and mine - luckily - were developed in a perfectly straight way in line with the rest of my teeth. Suggesting to remove them seems just ridiculous to me and a greedy way for the dentist to make some hundreds of euros extra by butchering me off.",1453942787

This is one of the reasons I feel viscerally that Basic Income is important - it would have made a massive impact in working thru this.<p>Yes, as a society we don&#x27;t value that kind of work that traditionally women have done the majority of - child rearing for example.   Maybe as a single dad I can now have some empathy or appreciation of that, that I wouldn&#x27;t have otherwise as a middle class white male.<p>Looking after my kid and making paintings have probably been the most useful things I&#x27;ve ever done - neither of them paying anything, unlike programming work which does provide an income.  I have to wonder what more useful things I could have spent my time doing, rather than some projects which paid ok, but were unlikely to be of much use to anyone.<p>I can relate to some of your comments - when I see people who want an Uber clone developed, or who think programmers should get 5 bucks an hour because they enjoy their work anyway.. or who dont understand how much skill it takes to draw a plausible figure, who think a one off oil painting should cost 70 bucks.  But then these people are using apps that cost 20 million bucks to develop but are free to use, or they can buy a print for 30 bucks and a chinese replica for 150..<p>There are some economists and even politicians who have been talking about the value of all the work that is done which is not paid for - value and money don&#x27;t match up, in many cases.  I hadnt seen the term &#x27;emotional labor metafilter&#x27; but I&#x27;d heard of the concept [ as I listen to people like Piketty, Paul Krugman, Elizabeth Warren and lately Bernie Sanders ]<p>My hope is that a Basic Income might be a way of partly fixing this flaw [where real work is undervalued], rather than entrenching it - if the free market is not efficient enough to pay you for the useful work you are doing, basic income might at least cover the cost of living.<p>Its not a solution to every ill.. teachers will probably still be paid less than their true worth, stay at home parents will probably still have to sacrifice a lot of income.  It wont solve sexism, racism, ageism .. but it might alleviate some of the worst symptoms, some of the current pain ?<p>Maybe the government service is in fact BI, because it covers so many special cases where individuals can do useful work, that the government wont ever be able to implement an overall program ?<p>> No one should be expected to live in poverty on an allotment of Basic Income while taking care of others. It is a shitty, shitty expectation.<p>I agree.. but I assume the Basic Income is more than being poor, that it was high enough to cover living expenses so that you are free to function without stress.<p>So the question is how much should BI be - equivalent to 15 bucks an hour ? 25 an hour ?  Should the minimum wage be set at the same level as BI ?  Location dependent on average rent ?",1453942743

10984956,comment,10984716,10984716,0,0,api,,,"I&#x27;ve thought for years that fundamental technological innovation basically stopped around 1970, and that almost everything since then has been refinement and broadening existing technology.<p>I&#x27;ve observed a similar thing in areas like film: most of today&#x27;s films are reboots, rehashes, and remakes or at least are exploring themes and plot templates already laid down. Musical innovation lasted longer but seems to have effectively stagnated since the late 1990s. I haven&#x27;t heard anything in a long time that doesn&#x27;t just riff on something pioneered before the year 2000.<p>There are pockets here and there: films like Primer and Upstream Color, experimental electronic music, deep learning. But none of these things are quite as dramatic as, say, the film 2001, Pink Floyd or Kraftwerk, or the integrated circuit.<p>There&#x27;s objective evidence of something &quot;breaking&quot; around that time in economics, too. Wage growth basically stopped shortly after 1970: <a href=""http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HY153_realwa_G_20150417085212.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HY153_realwa_G_...</a><p>I&#x27;ve wondered if future historians might not look back at ~1970 as the end of the enlightenment and the beginning of the next dark age.<p>But <i>what happened</i>?<p>I haven&#x27;t got a clue. Explanations I&#x27;ve toyed around with include things like:<p>- Philosophy: the 1970s saw the rise of both religious fundamentalism and its secular &quot;Skeptic&quot; counterpart -- dogmatic, fundamentalist ideologies that assert that we already know everything and there is nothing new to discover. When I go back before 1970 I&#x27;m often struck by the boldness and fearlessness of scientists and other intellectuals back then. The rise of &quot;new age&quot; thinking, which is also hostile to reason and enlightenment ideas, might also play a role. It seems like since 1970 people have become either total woo-woo new-age flakes (no rigor) or closed-minded fundamentalists (no creativity or imagination). Before that time it seems like you had more who were both rigorous and visionary.<p>- Economics: did we &quot;cancel progress&quot; by shifting from a progressive economic system that invested in the future to a conservative one that only invests in the present? Or was the decoupling of wages from productivity the <i>actual root cause</i> of the rest of the apparent stagnation?<p>- Psychological: did we experience &quot;future shock&quot; and double down on retro and nostalgia? This sort of fits in with what I discuss under philosophy.<p>- Television: before the popularity of TV people read books and interacted socially and kids played outside. TV is a passive medium that pulls people in and then feeds them all the same information, and it takes time that people might otherwise spend on interactive, social, and exploratory pursuits. Did TV make us stupid? The generation who grew up watching TV started to enter the workforce around 1970.<p>- The War on Drugs: To what extent were the geniuses of the past &quot;augmenting&quot; with over-the-counter amphetamines, easily obtainable psychedelics, etc.? I&#x27;ve heard anecdotes but has anyone ever even asked this question in anything approaching a rigorous way? Or is it too taboo? There was a general worldwide crackdown on mind-altering substances around 1970. Perhaps the kind of crazy creativity and extreme achievement we saw during the glory days is simply not something the human mind tends to do in its natural state.<p>- Slow Malthusian Collapse: was the &quot;limits to growth&quot; more or less correct, but the effect is unfolding a lot slower than predicted and with strain and collapse manifesting in less obvious ways?<p>- Bureaucratization: Was there a shift during that time toward a more bureaucratic academic and scientific community that is more hostile to &quot;maverick&quot; thinkers and new ideas? Do today&#x27;s researchers spend more time sucking up to grant funding and tenure committees and making sure to walk the straight and narrow to avoid being labeled &quot;cranks&quot; instead of really thinking and investigating? Or do the systems for selecting for scientific careers select good bureaucrats over geniuses? The same processes might be at work in other areas, e.g. the takeover of music and film industries by &quot;MBA thinking&quot; over people who actually care about art.<p>- Educational System Decline: Did we over-bureaucratize or otherwise compromise education somehow? Were older teaching methods better?<p>- Demographics: We&#x27;re having smaller families, which might affect both growth and parenting styles (more &quot;helicopter parenting&quot;). Nothing obvious here but who knows?<p>Shrug. But it is alarming to say the least.<p>Edit: here are some explanations I don&#x27;t buy:<p>- Political Correctness / Diversity: There&#x27;s a wing of the right that thinks that runaway equality and diversity ideology has some responsibility for this. If that&#x27;s true then why are some of today&#x27;s most innovative places also left-of-center culturally and why are the bastions of Red State America not centers of innovation? At best I see no correlation in either direction.<p>- Dysgenics: Even if &quot;stupid people&quot; are breeding more, genetic changes are too slow to account for this. Then you have things like the Flynn Effect, which argue the opposite. Again I see at best no correlation.<p>- Lack of War: Was it all WWII? I personally don&#x27;t buy it. WWI didn&#x27;t result in anything close to the postwar boom, and before that we had millennia of running around and hacking each other up with swords without inventing any integrated circuits or jet engines. Why didn&#x27;t the Crusades or the endless wars of late Rome lead to a technological explosion? Why didn&#x27;t Genghis Khan or the Aztecs land on the Moon?",1453941830

As with those problems, playing Go is one of those things you can easily get heaps of data for and formulate it as a nice supervised learning task. The task is still spotting patterns on raw data with learned features.<p>However, the current deep learning methods don&#x27;t (seem to) generalize well to all that our brains do - most of all learning to do many different things with online small input of data. I have not seen any research into large scale heterogenous unsupervised or semi-supervised learning with small batches of input - these big neural nets are still used within larger engineered systems to accomplish single specific tasks that require tons of data and computing power. Plus, the approach here still uses Monte Carlo Search in a way that is fairly specific to game playing - not general reasoning.<p>Clearly this is another demonstration Deep Learning can be used to accomplish some very hard AI tasks.

One reason for this is the immune system using ROS to essentially kill metastatic cells before they can be established. They found that cancer cells that do establish tumors tend to have mutations that make them resistant to oxidative stress.<p>&quot;Most relevant to this topic, however, they found that in mice exogenous antioxidants promoted distant metastasis. This suggests that if you have cancer and you take antioxidants, your chance of developing metastases is greater. Keep in mind most solid tumor are usually present for 2-3 years before they are diagnosed, so the risk potentially exists even for those who have not yet been diagnosed with cancer.<p>&quot;This has alarming implications given the popularity of antioxidant supplements.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/more-trouble-for-antioxidants/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/more-trouble-for-antiox...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/nature15726.epdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/articles/nature15726.epdf</a>",1453940264

Library is a new writing/publishing platform with a social structure built around the content to enhance the readers and writers experience. There are a lot of great and creative writers out there but it&#x27;s hard for them to have their work seen/read if they don&#x27;t have a strong social following and readers can&#x27;t discover these great amateur writers if they don&#x27;t know where to find them. That is why I thought of Library. Medium is attempting in going in the social networking direction but it&#x27;s not there yet. I think that&#x27;s where I can come in with Library. The app is based around the Library theme. I want to give users the illusion that they are attending a library as they would in person. So every user will have a library (aka profile) a real looking library card with the barcode and library number (aka about me section, bookcase (aka all of the content you have written) members who become members of your library (aka followers), memberships of the different library&#x27;s you&#x27;re interested in (aka following), and &quot;checking out&quot; content to read at a later time. Then there&#x27;s a most checked out section to give writers an incentive to write more quality work. So as you can see all this is kind of what you see and experience in going to a library in person.<p>As far as the landing page as to why you should sign up I&#x27;m trying to use an &quot;exclusivity&quot; tactic in hopes to make it go viral which is why I stated you need a library card to attend the grand opening of library and that there are only 500 library cards to give out but will be guaranteed a library card if cards run out by inviting 3 friends.",1453939926

Now, fill the ocean back up and start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the stack each time you’ve emptied the ocean. Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun.<p>Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits haven’t even changed.

This is due to the high costs of train tracks resulting in a natural monopoly.<p>Without even the threat of competition there is little incentive to control costs.

So despite the theoretical efficiency advantage of trains they are often more expensive than other forms of transport which is a real shame.",1453939391

Investors will obviously stay the course, continue dumping ever more capital into pointless apps and SaaSy startups, not to mention mysterious vaporware technologies like the one in question.

It makes sense to have a mini webpage delivered securely that lists hashes for all static assets, and then serve some static assets insecurely to take advantage of CDNs as long as they don&#x27;t disclose individual app actions (assets everyone sees on many pages).  The downside is the balancing of risk for activity leakage based on insecure assets.  Of course, some dynamic content and sensitive state needs to remain secure.  The issue is that securing everything depends on whether you&#x27;re willing to trust your CDNs and caches with your certs and private keys (granted, you already trust them to display the correct content.).  That sort of technical risk management needs to be considered carefully if insecure assets can dramatically speed up UX (because TLS sessions take some or a lot more work... since how would the browser and backends do session caching or pipelining across infrastructures and providers that likely have multiple IPs?  One connection per provider, each keeping their own cache for their HA boxes?)<p>Maybe there needs to be an insecure HEAD or CACHE open standard to check content freshness of a secure page via crypto hash (say canonical uri, etag and last modified) to avoid  building up a full TLS session to see nothing&#x27;s changed?",1453939203

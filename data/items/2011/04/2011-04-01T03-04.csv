Furthermore, you don't read the whole file into memory so your program only uses a small amount of memory while running. I'd work with grad students reading in 1-2GB of data to analyze it and allocating that all to a process, and they'd wonder why their system would slow down.<p>The best thing about it is that the OS does the caching.  So, say I analyze a file, I run a program with 4 arguments that maps a file to memory.  Next time it runs, the file is still in memory so it doesn't bother re-reading the original file.  (Try doing a recursive grep on directory, then try it again right after)",1301628284
2394796,comment,2394636,2394653,2,0,neild,,,"IPv6 is a perfectly fine protocol.<p>Supporting IPv6 is absolutely nothing like ""ripping out your spinal cord and putting a new one in"".  It's largely trivial if you aren't doing anything tricky--and, notably, it requires nothing that an IPv4.1 wouldn't require.  The Berkeley socket API was designed with support for multiple protocols from the start, so you shouldn't have to touch much beside your address structures and name resolution code.<p>And I say this from the standpoint of someone who added DHCPv6 support to a DHCPv4 server, which actually <i>is</i> tricky, since DHCPv6 is an entirely different protocol from DHCPv4 and substantially more complicated to boot.  It still wasn't all that bad.<p>Most importantly, IPv6 is <i>done</i>.  It's been done for years now.  The router support is there.  The OS support is there, with the exception of some laggards who really should get around to implementing DHCPv6.  It's in active use.  (Do you have a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem?  Congratulations, you're using IPv6!)  The biggest obstacle to deploying IPv6 is just <i>doing</i> it, and again that's not going to be any easier with an IPv4.1.",1301628185

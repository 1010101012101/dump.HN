But I was afraid of the weather and the Hurricans in the area.\nAll I needed to do is type “Cancun diving” in Twitter search and in seconds I got real time twitts of people who are actually there, talking about the dives they did just a hour ago.<p>And of course the obvious ad model is to now show me ads and deals for diving shops in Cancun.<p>This is the real promise of the real time search.</i>",1250999988

For example, in a two person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the client such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and on the server-side frameworks (such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the web server, and a database system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a web designer, web producer, project manager, software architect, or database administrator - or they may be responsible for such tasks as web design, project management, and database administration themselves.</i>",1250998946

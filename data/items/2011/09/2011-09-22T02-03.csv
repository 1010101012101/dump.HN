3024679,comment,3024342,3024611,1,0,dangoor,,,"""It's already a problem. In fact, it is the problem. The web application 'platform' is poor, incoherent, and its proponents highly resistant to the sweeping changes that would be necessary to compete with a native, proprietary platform like iOS.""<p>Which ""sweeping changes"" are those?<p>Changes like the ability to draw pixel-by-pixel? Vectors? 3D? (Canvas/svg/webgl)<p>Changes like higher level form controls? Got some in HTML5. New component model is under discussion now. Better layout of controls? The flexible box model helps a great deal, is already in lots of shipping browsers and is getting further cleaned up now.<p>Drag and drop? Yep.<p>How about the automatic data binding that's so cool in Cocoa? Not only are there application frameworks that do this (SproutCore, Knockout, Batman), there are also proposals like ""Model Driven Views"" (MDV) which use ECMAScript Harmony Proxy objects to make it cleaner.<p>What about files? Yeah, there are file APIs. Databases? localStorage is a simple key/value store. There's also WebSQL DB and IndexedDB which will hopefully be resolved in one way or another soon.<p>APIs for audio and geolocation are there now. Camera and other device APIs are in the works.<p>So, which sweeping changes do you mean? The ability to compile C code? Sorry, but I don't think most apps need that.<p>""The browser makers (especially Mozilla) seem insistent on leaving us in the lurch, stuck with JavaScript, the DOM, and the painfully long lead times of standardization.""<p>I can't say this for sure, but I'd be willing to bet that:<p>a. standardization is moving faster than it has in more than a decade
b. many APIs become usable in the real world well before the standards are complete<p>To be sure, the web-as-a-platform is not perfect today or in the future. But, its evolution is real.",1316660382

3024676,story,,,1,0,edroyhuang,"Do-it-yourself Pool Problems",http://www.classifiedads.com/real_estate_services-ad6315002.htm,"Upkeep of a backyard pool is ideally done in a weekly basis. Common problems with pool water require immediate attention, while issues on the pool structure itself can be delayed until your next break. But to be able to maintain the beauty and the satisfaction that you get during your pool recreation, all of these problems should be mended and given utmost attention.
Maybe one of the problems that a pool owner has to encounter is green algae formation and cloudy water. Green algae create a slimy feel on the pool surface and this problem is usually caused by poor filtration system or inactive levels of sanitizer. The good news is that, this could be fixed easily! Check the ph of your pool. Adjust it if is beyond 7.5. Brush the walls and floors and voila, problem solved.<p>With age, cracks in pools are apparent. As years pass, your pool would show signs of wear and tear. This problem usually leads to leaks. To prevent this, replacement is needed. For minor problems, this could be fixed without help from professionals. Start the process by cutting the crack area using a grinder or a diamond blade. The crack must be allowed to dry and be free from any substance. Then, it is best to apply a caulk to the crack. Once dried, create sand and cement mixture that would cover the crack. The use of knife or trowel is necessary in this process. 
The lining of pools usually have problems too. Town or ripped vinyl liners are common especially if the pool had undergone constant water imbalance. Age is also a reason for this problem. However, the solution for this is easy. The vinyl lining could be mended by purchasing kits that are available in hardware stores. There are different instructions for each manufacturer on how to best patch the lines tear.<p>Upkeep of pools is actually easy and does not require help from professional. However, for more complicated problems, it is necessary to consult trusted builders to solve it. Not only that it would require much of your time. But at the same time, prevent further damage on your pools.<p>Poulson Tile and Masonry is the leading pool repair system in San Diego. They are known for their outstanding workmanship and excellent results. For a trusted builder in San Diego, visit http://poolssandiego.com/.",1316660351

However, sites are just now starting to phase out IE6 support.

Actual classes, typed variables, and a platform that works the same in every browser.<p>Contrarian view but I see flash improving its lead on html.  Adobe doesnt have to deal with a bureaucratic standards body and can act decisively when making platform changes.  Ex: Id like to see MS, Mozilla, IE, Chrome, Apple, Opera all agree to implement similar features in Flash 11 (and work the same in each browser).  Then Id like to see them agree on new feature sets when Flash 12, 13, 14 come out etc.<p>I just dont see how five browser vendors can equal the agility of one flash vendor.  Too much red tape in the html congress<p>Yes, Flash is proprietary and it doesnt work well for mobile.  All I can say is that Ive been burned one too many times by IE not showing CSS table borders on empty cells (last time I checked IE8 still requires that damned ampersand in each cell!).  Im fed up with browser incompatibility.  All of the JavaScript frameworks (and now with Google making Dart) confirm that JavaScript is inherently outdated and broken.

I think there's been a huge shift in terms of how people view web technology.<p>gmail was the original ""holy crap"" app that started us building information apps with better user experiences. It proceeded from there to add things like canvas and svg and, more recently, webgl and audio, making apps well beyond ""information apps"" possible.<p>The ""Boot to Gecko"" (B2G) project which Mozilla kicked off a couple of months back is going to push quite firmly on adding all of the APIs needed for a modern mobile device. And, I might add, in conjunction with others in the standards bodies who are interested in such things.<p>And what about the Metro announcement from last week? Sure, Microsoft's ideal scenario is to build on the web and lock people into APIs that are tied to their platform... but, seriously, wouldn't people just write shims? Wouldn't Microsoft ultimately have to follow the standard because they are not quite the monopoly they were before?<p>The end of his post is telling:<p>""The closest thing we have to that today is Chromium, but they have no foothold in mobile and are likely years away from having one.

Quickly sifting through, I found these:<p>From 1995 we have a guy asking for a ""modeler with open source code.""<p>1996 has Caldera advocating ""an open-source code model"" (it even has the hyphen in the right place!), as well as an essay about ""Open Source Code and the Early Development of Unix."" The former case is interesting because it explicitly defines open-source code as source code that is openly distributed, and clarifies that a small fee is required to sell derived products commercially. (So SCO actually claimed the term before OSI did!)<p>And 1997 has a discussion about whether ""open source cryptography"" is better than ""proprietary  cryptography"" (and in which ""published"" is used as a synonym for ""open source"").<p>So it appears that the term was much less common before OSI  but it <i>was</i> used to talk about source code you could read, long before they came along with their definition.",1316657396

I put myself in the shoes of people who attend aerobics and cycling classes (I strictly do free weights and the occasional cardio machine). And even then, I think this would be a turnoff to them. Yes, they like the encouragement of having an instructor and the pressure of keeping up with their classmates. But generally they would be turned off by having to compete against another team. It might sound sexist, but a lot of the people who attend classes at my gym are women and there is more of an air of the class being like schoolyard skipping rope than competitive team sport.

1687488,comment,1686361,1686361,0,0,allertonm,,,"Surprised at the amount of agreement with this article, and the cries of ""incompetence"".<p>ISTM in a desktop app context, the consumer key/secret combination effectively becomes a complicated equivalent to your browser's ""User Agent"" string and yes, only slightly more difficult to spoof.<p>So what Twitter is asking for is that in order to authenticate a user (with additional credentials) you give them a valid ""user agent"" that was assigned by Twitter. This at least allows them to understand, when they get traffic, who wrote the app that's sending it. It's obviously not perfect in a desktop case but then neither is user agent - but there is no perfect solution for the desktop case, and Twitter's choice allows them use a consistent mechanism for client and server apps.<p>(Edit: the OA responds below and says I'm wrong about this part. I'll take his word for it.)\nI suspect the OA's problem is more with being a) asked to do this nasty complicated Oauth thing and b) with the idea of Twitter wanting to know who he is - and he'd rather they just let him keep on persisting user's twitter creds himself. Conflating this consumer key with DRM is a bit of a giveaway.<p>(Updated: The important point here is that the author's app is open-source and he chose to distribute the keys with the source code, rather than require each person who builds it from source to get their own API keys.\nI think Twitter's position - that the author should not have done this - is completely reasonable.)",1284400625

1687466,comment,1686782,1686782,0,0,malyk,,,"I moved here in 2008 and absolutely love the city.<p>What I like:<p>* There is always something going on.  As many tech meetups/lectures/etc as you can stomach.  Hell, there's an incredible amount of art/history/science/etc things going on every single day.  This is probably true in places like NYC, but I didn't have the same experience in DC.<p>* The weather is awesome.  Coming from DC I couldn't stand the hot and humid summers and the winters that were cold but without anything to show for it.  Plus every time it was going to snow a 1/4"" the entire town freaked out.  Sure, it's foggy sometimes...but the eastern half of the city sees sun for long periods on most days.  When the sun is out the weather is perfect.<p>* The topography of the area makes for some absolutely beautiful views.  If you don't like the outdoors you probably don't care, but there are so many amazing places to go hiking/biking/camping that are absolutely stunning.  It helps coming from the east coast since most of the plant life is totally different than what you find there.<p>* Traffic in the city proper is pretty damn good.  There are a few places that are congested every day, but once you figure those out getting around the city itself in a car is a breeze.<p>* I love the biking/public transportation culture.  I own a car and use it to get around on the weekends mostly, but I prefer the idea of using other forms of transportation.  I quite frankly can't figure out why people hate on MUNI so much.  Sure, it isn't up to NYC standards, but I've very rarely had any trouble on MUNI in the 2 years I've been here.  Back in DC I was lucky to have a bus come by my place once and hour.  Here there is a bus coming at least every 10 minutes.  I can go from western SOMA to most places in the city in under 45 minutes.  Sure...I could drive there in 20, but I'd have to find and pay for parking once I got there and risk parking tickets.  45 minutes on a bus with an iPhone is nothing.<p>* The tech/startup scene.  I'm only an observer, but I've never felt so inspired to do cool things as I am now that I'm here.  DC just didn't inspire me to try to use my skills as a developer to make fun things.  I was caught in the fed.gov contracting scene (still my day job) and it doesn't really push you to excel...especially outside of work.  Here I can't help but want to try my hand at new things.<p>There's more...but that will do for now.<p>Things I don't like...<p>* Parking enforcement.  A necessary evil, but seemingly arbitrary in the rules.<p>* My place is near a bunch of clubs and people have no problem using it as a bathroom.  Definitely on the gross side of things.<p>* Traffic outside of the city.  The Bay Bridge always seems to be backed up.  Same with 101.  I wouldn't want to commute by car in or out of the city proper.  Caltrain would have to be available to me if I were to work or live outside the city.<p>* The lack of green space around my house.  We chose to live in this particular location, and generally it's a great place to be, but would it kill the city to toss some planters or something nearby?  I haven't asked them too, but man a little green on the streets around here is seriously needed.<p>There's probably a few more things I don't like, but they aren't coming to mind.<p>Basically this place is far superior to where I came from and I love it.",1284400302

It's sort of like the transition from local multiplayer on a game console to online play.  Home multiplayer video games have been around since the 80's, but it's not until recently that they've made their way online.  The internet is a great tool because it ensures that you never suffer from a lack of available teammates/competitors.  In the olden days, your ability to partipate was dependant on those around you having the same interest.  Scott suggests setting up gyms for this kind of thing, but the beauty is that with the proper equipment, anyone would be able to compete from home.  This could be a boon for people living in more remote/rural areas who want to compete in team athletic events.<p>Plus, there's all kinds of other neat things that you can have the tech do with regards to scoring, like having a system to scale/normalize scores so that a team of 10 adults can compete against a team of 10 children and come out with roughly a 50/50 win ratio.",1284399975

The problems became (1) determining whether you would one day out of the blue have code ""act weird"", (2) figuring out where this behaviour was coming from.<p>Save to say, many people got bit/burned/scarred.  Lessons were learned. There is a fair bit of cross-polination going on; I can't think of any python framework that has not tried to learn from this, and also from the successes/challenges of others (and that includes those of Rails btw).<p>So when a ""battle scarred veteran"" makes a terse statement such as this, I don't think by any means it expresses a ""better-than-thou"" attitude.  But you can understand why there might be (rightly or wrongly) an anticipation of pain to come.<p>When pythonistas look as Rails (for example) and say ""hmmn, this pattern looks sort of familiar, wonder how they're going to avoid that type of pain we had"",  surely this is neither unfair nor over critical, it's just part of the technical dialogue that ultimately advances everyone's ""state of the art.""<p>And I don't think anybody in the python world really claims to have the ""one true answer.""  Rather it's more the case of ""there is no one true answer, only many flawed attempts;  so if you think you've found nirvana, be prepared for some disappointment down the road.""<p>Generally people acknowledge that it's a difficult problem and that we're all dealing with variations of the same issues, irrespective of language or framework.

Things like parsers and ASTs are more complex concepts, sure, but they are common concepts that leave little room for doubt.<p>I think data structures become much more important in FP for some of the reasons you've outlined.

So I spent all my time either at work or at home, and went out as little as possible.  Lived in a tiny house because it was all I could afford.  Hated it.<p>OTOH, I did meet a lot of lifelong friends there, including my wife. It's the only place I've lived where my geekiness wasn't the least bit unusual and where I wasn't usually the smartest person in the room, and that was refreshing.<p>Now I live in the middle of nowhere in a 4,000 ft2 house on 50 acres of land, which in retrospect was overreaction to the valley's housing and crowding.  It still takes 20 minutes to get to the supermarket, but now I travel 15 miles of country roads instead of seven blocks of six-lane parking lot.<p>When I go back (I telecommute), I'm struck by the wealth, the workaholism, and the aforementioned number of geeks.

However well you can program, if you can't manage the business side of things, you're cooked.<p>You also shouldn't underestimate the benefits of developing more in the general education areas. Developing a firm grasp of English writing is absolutely vital. Developing the capacity to further understand and appreciate history and culture can also be very helpful. This kind of sampling can also help you realize other areas of interest and help build up a general pattern of understanding which can be useful in understanding all frameworks. You can, in theory, learn all this on your own. It's just that college can really help you get started if you're serious about it and are actually there to learn.<p>At the same time, though, I've now been considering whether to continue into a graduate program. I've excelled in classwork, and it seems like a no-brainer, but since I don't have a definite direction I'm opting not to pursue a graduate degree.  At least not for now.

Knows how to solve it on the spot? Probably pretty clever. Finding the optimal 100 node long path in a graph as a screening method to send in a resume? Funny stuff there.<p>Being a bit clever myself though I'll go a bit further here. I'd say you might be the person who posted that ad. But I think more likely is you want to apply for the job and have no idea at all how to solve that problem and are hoping by coming here and pretending it is trivial someone like me will give you some hints. Because if you really knew your stuff, you wouldn't be claiming it was trivial for any competent practitioner to solve and a reasonable screening question.<p>Sure, there is an easy answer out there for doing this search, that's almost certain. That everyone competent would figure it out easily? Nah.",1284397640

1687240,comment,1686782,1686782,0,0,tptacek,,,"Spent several years in San Francisco. Hated it. Moved back to the midwest (Ann Arbor, then back home to Chicago).<p>What don't I like about SFBay? With the caveat that it's been almost 10 years since I lived there, let me make you a list:<p>* It's expensive. What that means is, you have fewer options on where to live, and the options aren't as nice.<p>* Apart from tacos, the casual food options are much worse. Concrete example: where do you go for late dinner after a show, besides a diner in the Castro and Mel's?<p>* There are very few decent music venues. Among my many complaints about SF, this is one that appears to have gotten much worse since I left; read JWZ's blog on SF's ""war on fun"".<p>* It is impossible to catch a cab.<p>* It is very difficult (and dangerous) to park. My car was towed in San Francisco and lost by the city for over a month.<p>* San Francisco is deceptively small. Deceptive, because SFBay is a major metro area that happens to sprawl from a small urban core. What this means is that many of your friends who ostensibly live in the same ""place"" as you are actually an hour's drive each way to get to.<p>* Similarly, many (technically, most) of the jobs in the ""area"" are actually a 1+ hour commute <i>each way</i> from your house. At the time, I didn't know <i>anybody</i> who took the train from San Francisco to South Bay; maybe that's changed, but my perception is everyone just drives and puts up with the horrible commute. 280 sure is pretty sometimes, though.<p>* It's filthy. I've been back recently and know this to still be true: San Francisco has a maintenance problem, and it's different and worse than Manhattan. Manhattan feels like you're always picking your way through someone's gigantic cluttered basement. This alters your expectations of the environment and makes bags of garbage on the street easier to take. San Francisco is flat and open and that makes the piles of human feces somehow harder to take.<p>* Public transportation in San Francisco, is a joke compared to NYC or Chicago or even Seattle. It achieves Houstonian levels of walkability despite a miniscule footprint.<p>* The Haight and the stretch of Golden Gate Park right off the Haight is disgusting. I'm in favor of legalization, but if we're going to do it with red light districts, we should at least cordon them off and make that clear.<p>* Too much of San Francisco is a tourist trap. Every big city has tourist areas, but it's more painful in San Francisco because the city is so small. In NYC and Chicago there are <i>actual</i> Italian restaurant neighborhoods and they aren't full of frat boys.<p>* San Francisco doesn't have neighborhoods like other cities do. People tend to counter this by saying ""but the inner sunset is totally different from the outer sunset"". When's the last time they had a block party? How many of their neighbors have they entertained in their houses in the last year?<p>* There are no seasons (ok, there's ""grey"" season and ""yellow"" season). It's about to be Autumn here in Chicago. Autumn in the midwest is amazing and I missed it, a lot.<p>* Everyone's in tech. This makes the social scene boring and incestuous. Also, unless you build products that serve the echo chamber, it makes it harder to sell to companies, because the industries in San Francisco aren't diverse.<p>I'm trying hard with this list not to ding San Francisco for things that other cities excel at. It's not reasonable to hate a city for not meeting the highest bars set by other cities. For instance, fine dining in San Francisco is, if you properly exclude Yountville from your definition of ""San Francisco"", simply not as good as NYC or even Chicago. San Francisco doesn't have world-class museums. It doesn't have a noteworthy theater scene, or (to my knowledge) excellence in any of the performing arts. But then, Chicago doesn't have redwood forests or beaches you can set bonfires on with no notice.",1284397603

There's no locking at any SW level with a CAS since you just call that instruction rather than locking, doing a compare, branching, doing a swap, and unlocking. Fetch-and-add seems to be a CPU instruction as well. You can implement these things with a lock, but it's not necessarily the case.<p>Atomic instructions provide atomicity, but not locking per se. Locking is just another means to atomicity. A lock says ""don't schedule another thread to access this resource until I say so"", an atomic CPU instruction says ""don't execute another CPU instruction in the middle of me"". Locks are, as is often the case, both far more powerful and far more dangerous to use.",1284397510

Whether you write your tests before or after you write code, you always have a at least one form of testing written (or infered) first: types. And yes, the shape of your code <i>is</i> influenced by your types and your tests (e.g. by making code easily testable with more meaningfull tests/propositions about it).",1284397489

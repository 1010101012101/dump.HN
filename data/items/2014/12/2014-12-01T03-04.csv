We need to analyze our code bases, and how we grew those, in order to understand the trade-offs and nature of our approaches. And by this I really mean analyze the code base, the &quot;project idioms&quot;, the abstractions, their cooperation.<p>Examples I recall are from the Lisp world where the bottom-up onion is a well liked strategy (layering toolboxes on toolboxes, each made up of many small pieces which can be combined effectively). Another such observation is the many types with few methods vs many functions on few types debate. This is what I want to see researched (and research myself).",1417404956

What does this have to do with reducing the possibility of Java 8 compatibility?<p>One advantage the Jayce development seems to provide is the possibility of optimizing Dalvik bytecode output based on data that is hard to recover from Java bytecode but present in the Java source. Secondarily, there may be build time improvements, but build times aren&#x27;t C++ bad.<p>But my best guess at why they did this is to support Java 8 on older devices. Without Proguard in the build system, they would have to include the entire Java 8 class library subset they plan to support in every build, resulting in massive distributables. By building Proguard into the base build system, they can include just the part of Java 8 that is necessary for the app. Jayce likely has some features that make the Proguard tasks easier.<p>I&#x27;m speculating far beyond the OP here.",1417402913

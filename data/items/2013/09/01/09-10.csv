6309721,comment,6308316,6309527,2,0,rejschaap,,,"Not really relevant to OP. But I&#x27;ve seen parents distinction being made in companies more than once. They basically let the &#x27;senior&#x27; programmers create new products and features (type 1 work). They let the &#x27;junior&#x27; programmers do the maintenance on the results (type 2 work). The biggest problem with this organisation is that there is no feedback loop for the &#x27;senior&#x27; programmers. They can mass produce garbage code and not worry about the consequences at all. Often the &#x27;senior&#x27; programmers even start looking down on the &#x27;junior&#x27; programmers for being merely maintenance programmers. Which is obviously messed up.<p>I treat anyone who claims he&#x27;s a pure type 1 programmer with suspicion. I seriously question anyone can be good at the type 1 work and be bad at the type 2 work. There are a lot of programmers out there who hate doing the type 2 work though.<p>On the other hand there are also a lot of people out there who really shouldn&#x27;t be doing any programming at all. They usually end up getting stuck in type 2 work and maybe reinforce the idea that a distinction between type 1 and 2 programmers could be made. But the reality is they should probably choose another profession entirely.",1378029498

And big players are not entering the market. B24 charged 0.00% per trade (the exchange was taken down though). In fact if you think about it BTC transactions could and should potentially have almost no cost, as opposed to fiat exchange transactions, which have a lot of overhead. The problem with bitcoin is that the exchanges are the new bottleneck for couterparty risk. In any network it is always the exit nodes that count.<p>The problems are mostly of a legal nature. There is a layer missing, which has not yet been implemented. The problem evolves around identity. Would it possible to link a name in a register to a virtual address globally? Nation states still want to collect taxes and money is tied to the power of nation states (you can witness what happens if this connection is removed in Europe).<p>If you want build an exchange you will have to a deep pocket for legal.

6309704,comment,6308878,6309350,5,0,pyre,,,"&quot;entrapment&quot; is such a diluted phrase these days. What entrapment <i>really</i> means is that a law enforcement officer encouraged someone to do something that they wouldn&#x27;t have done otherwise. If an undercover cop asks a drug dealer for drugs, this is <i>not</i> entrapment.<p>Entrapment would be like if an undercover officer put a gun to someone&#x27;s head and told them to steal something, then arrested them for stealing. Or if an undercover officer became the leader of a peaceful activist movement, and then started preaching that they should get violent; then arrested all of the protesters that got violent.<p>It gets a little sticky in some cases, like the Portland bomber case. The undercover FBI agents kept asking him if he <i>really</i> wanted to do it. Looking at it one way you could say that they were discouraging him from doing it. On the other hand, he thought that they were terrorists, so even if he found himself in over his head, he would be unlikely to feel like he could back out at any time. Saying, &quot;You can back out at any time,&quot; could just as easily be a ruse to test his resolve.",1378028970

6309702,comment,6307236,6308622,1,0,basicallydan,,,"Fair points, perhaps I was a little rash. The reason I feel urked by the idea is that it seems to me that it would lead to a greater lock-in of technologies and products that a business can use. More investment would need to be made in order to support a technology or product and thus would make it harder to switch to something else if requirements changed. I can see the use of having certifications for hiring as well as credibility to clients, but I feel that there&#x27;s probably a fair amount of danger in this too.<p>As for the books, that was an off-hand comment, half to illustrate that I am, in fact, not experienced with the world of Microsoft Certifications, and so whatever I say should be taken as comment from a layman :)",1378028921
6309701,comment,6309008,6309209,3,0,Silhouette,,,"Most, if not all, of the problems people are describing in this discussion come down to trying to assign something that isn&#x27;t a boolean value to a variable of boolean type, and expecting it to do something sensible. I don&#x27;t see how this is ever going to have a happy ending.<p>If you had written<p><pre><code>    bool a = (someInt & 0x02) == 0x02\n</code></pre>\nor something similarly clear and unambiguous, nothing odd would happen, even in C.<p>(Edit: OK, that&#x27;s not strictly true, because of the operator precedence order. It&#x27;s never made sense to me that integer arithmetic operators have higher precedence than comparisons but bitwise logical operators have lower precedence, so if you remove the parentheses above then the resulting code doesn&#x27;t do what you&#x27;d expect. I suppose this is because I&#x27;m looking at the problem as if comparison operators return a proper boolean value rather than an integer, and the ordering we&#x27;ve wound up with in C dates from a historical oddity about 40 years ago.)<p>The underlying problem with booleans in C99, as Linus and others have been saying, is that the language doesn&#x27;t actually enforce basic type safety, so cases like your first example<p><pre><code>    bool a = someInt & 0x02\n</code></pre>\nthat should result in a type error are allowed through, and with odd results: how does it make any sense for a <i>boolean</i> variable to have an integer value like 0x01 or 0x02?<p>Then programmers who relied on such odd results wind up writing horrific code like your second example<p><pre><code>    bool a = !!(someInt & 0x02)\n</code></pre>\nwhere fudge factors build on top of distortions to make the old hacks work.<p>And then we wonder why in 2013 we still have widely used, essential software that is riddled with security flaws and crash bugs. :-(",1378028907

You&#x27;ll find yourself frequently pulling stuff out of a controller and sticking it in a view, or a route. Having to constantly switch files, remember where things are, create new files, and remove stuff from version control really puts a damper on things.<p>My advice to anyone starting with Ember: download the starter kit from emberjs.com and try to stick inside that as long as you can.  You can just drop it into your Rails /public folder and get up and running.<p>Once you have a solid understanding of the architecture, and your app is getting bigger, it&#x27;s literally an hour&#x27;s work to pull everything out into separate files and drop it into something like the Rails asset system.",1378028817

6309659,comment,6301456,6301974,1,0,goggles99,,,"I am sick of this whole notion that poor people cannot pull themselves up by their bootstraps. This notion that &quot;poverty taxes the brain&quot; is utter nonsense. Peoples brains are generally not taxed by being poor, their brains are lazy and their attitudes are bad, that is why they are poor to begin with.<p>I take personal interest and issue with comments surrounding this since I lived it. I have personally experienced, watched and read detailed stories of so many living in America who have done just this - Pulled themselves up out of poverty.<p>My personal experience (and those close to me as well) with having almost nothing was this: You have a lot less to worry about (literally). You don&#x27;t own much, you have a lot of time to think and research how best you should improve your life. You have <i>less</i> distractions and it is easier to focus on your goals and ambitions. If you have a simple budget (takes hardly any time to make one when you are poor) you don&#x27;t have to even think about &quot;will I have enough money to make rent this month&quot;. This whole notion of poverty taxing the brain is yet another &quot;excuse&quot; for the poor disadvantaged soul living in poverty.<p>It comes down to this, if someone works hard and makes good choices (either on their own accord or by following wise advice), they are absolutely going to escape the poverty they may have been born into or ended up in by some circumstance.<p>Let me give you a little example of how things have changed in the last couple of hundred years. Do you think that early settlers brains were &quot;taxed&quot; so hard that they could not work hard? That they could not make good choices? They had to work hard just to eat, just to feed their families (if they had them). If they made one bad choice or made one mistake, they could have lost their herd or crop. This could mean their very lives. They may never have been able to escape barely surviving back then, but times are much different today. Take that level of work ethic and wise/conscientious decision making and put it into the average poverty stricken youth today and do you think would happen?<p>Your family&#x27;s lack of money should mean almost nothing today, if anything - it should be extra motivation to work hard and improve you and your family&#x27;s lives. Is there a reason that a minority youth in the worst and poorest inner city project cannot go to school, pay attention in class, do their homework and achieve at least a &quot;C&quot; average? Well with that average, they will be accepted to any state college. If they are poor, there is a ton of financial aid (free money) available. If necessary - get a student loan (this is your ticket out of poverty here, it is worth it). This is the escape out of the projects that almost everyone can do. It will not cost you a single penny of your own money until you finish college. Even then you can take an online film study (or similar) class at a local community college ($50) every semester and put off paying back your student loan almost indefinitely.<p>we see case after case of middle or upper class people lose everything and climb back up out of poverty, immigrant after immigrant (or refugee) come to America with nothing to their name and even not be fluent in English in many cases, yet climb out of poverty, minorities from the poorest and most violent inner-city projects climb out of poverty, yet I hear again and again how and why people cannot do it on their own. Well people do. What makes these people so special? Are they extra smart? Do they have more attractive faces and bodies? What is it that allows some to climb out of poverty where most cannot.<p>The limiting factor here is themselves - their attitude. This has been fostered by such things as the collapse of the family, the loss of strong morals and ethics, the nanny state (creating dependency and sending a message that they cannot do it on their own - creating victims), the entitlement attitude, the victim and disenfranchised mentality, racism (I mean minorities toward majorities here), class envy, the entire black culture in America today.<p>You would think that if the government really wanted to solve poverty, they would lookup everyone in the country who had escaped poverty, and interview them. How did you do it? How could others do this too? Then publish the results in a big ad campaign.<p>What would we find? A huge overlap of answers (which I already outlined). The problem is - the government is not really interested in eliminating poverty. Nor keeping people out of prison. The government (generally) is not the friend of the minority or the impoverished. The government does not wish to eliminate or diminish itself by enabling people to become independent of it.<p>Is it &quot;fair&quot; that someone is born with a silver spoon in their mouth and can move through life lazy and comfortable, while another is born in poverty and must work harder and have to make better choices to succeed? Of course it is not &quot;fair&quot;, but it is reality and it is not changing. I can tell you a fact though that the individual who pulls themselves up by their bootstraps is a lot happier and more content person than the one born into wealth. Is that &quot;fair&quot; too? Happiness is something that can never be purchased (for any amount of money).",1378027951

There is one thing that most patent trolls are terrified of, and it&#x27;s a well researched and filed invalidation claim.<p>My other suggestion, if you think you might get sued for a particular aspect of your app, try to isolate it as much as possible. For instance, if you have an app that makes money through ads. Form one company that makes the app and another that pays a nominal fee to display ads in that app. One Company makes the money, the other &quot;infringes.&quot;<p>Finally, get any lawyer, any one that will agree to represent you and file a declarative action in your jurisdiction to invalidate your claim.<p>Just my 2 cents.

It depends on the context.) But, if you know or reasonably should know that you&#x27;re aiding in the commission of crime, then you have committed a crime. You needn&#x27;t be explicitly informed of criminal intentions by your students. Willful ignorance will not protect you from prosecution.<p>So, for example, mere publication of a book on polygraph countermeasures is probably protected speech, particularly if the information is presented as valuable data for public debate, rather than instructions for would-be criminals. (Don&#x27;t take my word for it, and remember I said &quot;probably.&quot;) But, if a person coaches individuals, and a reasonable person in the same position would suspect criminal intentions, then the coach is probably no longer engaging in protected speech.<p>One wonders, then, where the line is drawn. How much does one have to know about his students before it becomes actual knowledge of willful ignorance, both of which can result in conviction? One can reasonably assume that at least some percentage of all polygraph evaders do so in a context where it&#x27;s criminal. How does this affect the legality of teaching countermeasures in a one-on-one context?<p>It turns out that the distinctions are subtle, and the case law complex.

I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re being the grown-up, you are just talking from your world view. You sound similar to the people who railed against Ford&#x27;s 5 day work week - &quot;The workers will all be drunken and fighting and murdering and and and and...&quot; But it worked out fine in the end. The &#x27;hippie commune like&#x27; extra day off didn&#x27;t destroy the fabric of society. In fact, productivity and profits went up.<p>I think in the new millennium we should be experimenting with different models of running business. Why do you feel that a model that has worked well for the past 100 years is the final form of <i>all</i> business? Why say that it is a &#x27;hippie commune&#x27; in such a derogatory manner? Not all businesses can use this model and not all CEOs should operate the way <i>you</i> feel. It is a multi0faceted world out there, and I believe businesses should reflect this.<p>Should your company run like this? No, its not in your mentality and probably not possible for your industry. But... Semco has proven that this type of model can work even for a large hardware manufacturer (marine pumps was their original line of business, but with innovation to their business format came lots of innovation in their product line).<p>All I see in your well though out post is anecdotal data wrapped in an inherent pessimism towards people and a &#x27;hard-ball&#x27; mentality towards business. You are coming off harsh, but I don&#x27;t think it is quite as righteous as you want it to be. You know what is best - <i>for you</i> - why not let others experiment and see if we can&#x27;t create something different for business in the future. Some will fail, some will thrive, but it is the experimentation which is vital. And this post is a great example of someone who is in a position to do it, and may well be very successful. If they go bankrupt then come to HN and boast about how change is never good and your way is the only way to run a business. And I will still call you out on it even then.<p>One question for you: If you knew your employers finances (Semco gives all staff a 2 week course on understanding the books), and could see that if you didn&#x27;t take a pay cut now, you would lose your job in 3 months as the company would go bankrupt, would you vote for a pay decrease or say fuck it, I&#x27;m keeping my salary the same and damn the consequences?",1378026832

The answer for you will likely depend on the complexity of the product that you are building, how important a great UX is, how close you are to shipping something, and whether the promise of building a clean and scalable browser application outweighs the short term benefits of delivering a &quot;mess of ad-hoc jQuery and random objects&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve worked within a medium sized team building a large Ember application and have seen first hand how beneficial it can be when dealing with application complexity and a need for precise UX attention to detail, even when using a much earlier version. I&#x27;ve also experienced frustration with the documentation and quickly moving goalposts as the framework evolved towards v1.0.<p>Happily, everything has become so much easier in the last few months. The documentation and guides are now a fantastic resource after a huge push from the team and community. The framework itself requires much less boilerplate code, Ember automatically generates controllers, routes and views at runtime should you not need to customise their behaviour. The addition of support for promises across the framework has resulted in more terse and consistent application code. I&#x27;ve found the community to be very helpful and I&#x27;m excited to see how it will grow over the coming months.<p>> So there will end up being a chunk of the app with Ember, and a (functionally separate) part of the app not using Ember at all.<p>I&#x27;m helping a client do exactly this at the moment. Their current application consists of a many pages with ball of JavaScript and jQuery sitting on top of their clean REST API. They want to raise the bar for what their application can do and the medium term goal is to deliver a single page Ember application. In the short term, we&#x27;re building some of the most complex new features in Ember. These features will be accessed through modal iframes for a time allowing us to build out the Ember application without having to rebuild everything.",1378026594

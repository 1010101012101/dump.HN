However, even that ORM would allow you manually write a query and then run it and it would convert the results back into lovely packaged objects to pass around and work on.<p>In a language like PHP there's a lot of annoying boilerplate you have to write around every query you run by hand like looping over the result set that an ORM can just convert into a pretty little associative array for you with a consistent structure.<p>As far as I'm aware, any ORM allows for hand-written queries, so if the argument is that ORM-generated queries are too bloated/slow, you can still write optimized queries where needed and still take advantage of the automatically conversion of the result set to a useful object.",1336643259

To me, the browser is the single most important piece of software on any computer.<p>People love to talk about how iOS native apps totally win over web apps. But do they stop to think why that is the case? Because, the one native app - a better browser - that could change the situation is not allowed on iOS.<p>Firefox and Chrome pushed the boundaries a lot when they first appeared on the desktop scene. But now they've become too caught up in standards compliance to actually do radically innovative things (except B2G, I'll admit).<p>I'm betting on a new kickass browser on Android to either force Apple and Microsoft to open up, or make them irrelevant.",1336640886

3952469,comment,3944871,3951211,1,0,danssig,,,"We'll have to agree to disagree on that.  Right now I'm a cog in a big company and I know what I do isn't as valuable as what entrepreneurs do.  I came in to a team who had a horrible software system, replaced everything and brought running costs way down by decreasing code size while increasing features and maintainability.  But in the end, it's all for nothing.  As soon as I'm gone the team will either be decommissioned entirely, handed over to some other team who will have no use for what I've done or outsourced somewhere that will rewrite everything again.<p>Big companies are just a game of musical chairs for managers.  They just need to show something on their 360 reports so they can get a promotion and they couldn't care less what happens to their previous team once they get that.  They don't even care about the company itself, only climbing the ladder.  If the company fails then they can just move somewhere else with their new higher rung experience and start the climb again.  If you're a developer in such a place either you're trying to play the game yourself or you're literally whoring out your mind and fingers for cash.  The job itself is utterly meaningless and can never be made meaningful because what you produce is irrelevant.  The only part that matters is the politics.<p>It's true that many of us end up here because we have no other choices, but it's important to keep in mind what you're actually doing.  Don't romanticize being an intellectual prostitute.  Save up as much as you can so you can get out.  If you're happy to stay in such a place, then yea I do have less respect for you.",1336640505

3952465,comment,3949489,3949971,3,0,Karn,,,"I agree wholeheartedly. I have a solution that I've been using for years - a stylesheet that overrides everything. I just got tired of having to adjust to different fonts and color schemes for each website. After years of using computers for 8+ hours a day I have settled on the perfect (for me) combination of color, contrast, font styles and sizes, button styles, link styles, etc., and that's what I want to see. If that's not enough I have a Scriptish script that formats any page to my specification with a keypress.<p>I actually think this is the future of browsing (at least for people who do a lot of reading in-browser).

All else being equal, I'm sure the police don't want to compromise people's privacy. To be sure it's not their top priority, and if they had to choose between missing important data and dragging too many innocent people into an investigation they will probably err on the side of too much data.<p>Even if the police don't much care about privacy, there are a lot of people who do.

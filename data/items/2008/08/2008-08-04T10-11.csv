266170,comment,266056,266155,0,0,mark-t,,,"Actually, I do have trouble with Gimp, too. I have to google how to make a straight line every time. Choosing brushes and changing the color are a pain, too. But I don't use it often, and about half the time I'm using it where I would have used MS Paint when I used Windows. There's probably a toy program somewhere that fills that gap, and I just haven't bothered looking. Maybe I should pick up Xfig.",1217847212
266169,comment,265897,266145,0,0,philh,,,"I'd like to see you back that up. $a[0][0] does exactly what it looks like it should do: it takes the first element of the list at $a[0]. (Incidentally, this is exactly the same as the gp's $a[0]->[0].) The only problem sigils introduce is the -> in expressions like $a->[0]. ($a is a reference to a list, and you can't write $a[0] in this case because it will look at the list @a.)<p>I'm not entirely sure why perl doesn't have good support for nested arrays and hashes, but I'm pretty sure it's not to do with sigils.",1217846967

In fact, I only really respect the first one, but I've found that the other two can be very strong indicators of the first, and it's generally a bad bet to assume that someone who's clearly more experienced and/or knowledgeable than you on a topic is not also more competent (at least in some way).",1217846009

Wrote them an email, got an educational version, read the manual very thoroughly, made up exercises and solved them, read and tried to understand a lot of code.

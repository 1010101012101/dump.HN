Mine were sudden panic attacks, which when they happened first, I thought I was dying so I called 911 for nothing and was told there&#x27;s nothing wrong w/my heart even though I felt chest pains/tightness (a common occurence w/MDD, but who&#x27;d know, right?)...which then got worse over time, despite what I did, exercise, vitamins, supplements, sleep, drinking, and other things I won&#x27;t name, only because I (formerly) despised psychiatry as a profession and thought it was gobbledy gook.<p>For reason I won&#x27;t outline here, someone strongly suggested, after having fought this unsuccessfully for quite some time and needlessly suffering, that I visit a psychiatrist because in his view, I had MDD.  This is someone I truly trusted and he apparently dealt with his MDD in the past, so I was like, ok, I&#x27;m at the end of my rope so I&#x27;ll give the MD a shot.<p>The best way to describe what happened few months down the road after a few trial/errors to see which SSRI fits me best (and that&#x27;s how everyone finds out - trial/error, any doctor worth his salt will admit this- or they lie to your face if they say otherwise), is a persistent feeling developed, or I should say, resurrected only because I forgot how it felt to feel normal since I was a kid - of being lifted out of a deep hole that I seem to have been in for years, if not decades.<p>All the b.s. about sexual dysfunction they petrify guys with - for me was not true, in fact, it was quite the opposite as I regained control over that aspect of my life, rather than desensitizing myself with some activities which may have eventually led to ED, despite some &quot;logic&quot; that was telling me that I was doing the &quot;right thing&quot; ...<p>I could focus better at work, I was calmer in general with my wife, kids, and was more chipper and lit up overall. It&#x27;s not a high or a dependency...to test it, I stopped, went through what one might call a &quot;withdrawal&quot;, but then the MDD kicked back in in full force after a few months of being off it.<p>Since then, I went back on and decided it is much more important to be productive and focused on an SSRI, than a panic-induced, anxious, crying fits, lost mess without it.<p>So do SSRIs work? They worked for me - in conjunction with some therapy. Do they address the EXACT cause of depression? Unlikely. MDD is multi-causal, some nurtured by choice, some genetically inherited, no one really knows... but SSRIs treat it well enough in many cases.<p>Don&#x27;t dismiss anything out of hand - would be my advice. Depression (clinical, not just depression cause you lost your job or gf/bf - which tends to go away) is real and it is sucks big time.  Mine was classified as MDD of moderate to severe character...and I asked the doc, what&#x27;s really severe - his response was, curling up into a ball on the couch and not being able to function.  Some are worse and potentially self-destructive...(i.e. suicide). There is help...SSRIs are just one of many ways to treat this. Point is to reach out for help when someone points it out to you - if you trust them, and you&#x27;ve struggled w/it long enough to the point of unmanageabiility. Study upon study show high causality between SSRI therapy and major reduction of MDD symptoms...<p>good luck!",1429768599

9425187,comment,9415487,9424691,0,0,ColinWright,,,"I see you posted this on Facebook:<p><pre><code>    There was a post on hacker news about floating numbers.
    It said &quot;if 1+x is 1&quot;, then &quot;1-x is not.&quot;  There is a
    long explanation of how this is true.  They are very
    proud of this outcome. They believe this wired outcome
    is &quot;perfect logical&quot;. I just want to say &quot;F**k you!&quot;
    If your program can&#x27;t handle those even kids can do,
    you are writing rubbish. F**k you!
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s not a case of being proud of it, it&#x27;s an unavoidable consequence of using a small number of bits (32, 64, 128, 65536, all these numbers are small) to try to represent a very large range of numbers.  In other words, it&#x27;s an unavoidable consequence of using floating point.<p>The point is that floating point numbers are not mathematics, and they don&#x27;t obey all the mathematical laws you&#x27;ve been taught.  They&#x27;re an excellent model, provided you stay away from the edges.  But if you do go close to the edges, the inaccuracies of the model get exposed.  To understand the difference is of real value.<p>Let&#x27;s use mathematical reasoning to show why it&#x27;s true.<p>Using 64 bit (say) numbers to represent a range larger than 0 to 2^64-1 we must choose either that the numbers we can represent are equally spaced, or not.<p>If we choose them to be equally spaced then we either cannot represent 0, or we cannot represent 1.  To see this, suppose we can represent both 0 and 1.  The numbers being equally spaced means that we can then represent 2, 3, 4, and so on up to 2^64-1.  Now we have nothing left to go beyond, and thus we are not representing a range larger than 0 to 2^64-1.  So if the representable numbers are equally spaced, then we cannot represent both 0 and 1, which seems sub-optimal.<p>If we choose them not to be equally spaced then there will be consecutive representable numbers r0<r1<r2, such that mathematically r1-r0 is not equal to r2-r1. Now set:<p><pre><code>    d0 = r1-r0 so that r0 + d0 = r1
    d1 = r2-r1 so that r1 + d1 = r2
</code></pre>
Suppose that d0 < d1, and let h = (d0+d1)/2.  Hence (d0/2)<h<(d1/2).<p>Note that d0, d1, and h might not be representable.<p>Now r0 and r1 are consecutive representable numbers.  The number h is more than half the gap between r0 to r1, so we would want r1-h to round down to r0.  But the number h is <i>less</i> than half the gap from r1 to r2, so we would want r1+h to round to r1.<p>Therefore:<p><pre><code>    r1 - h = r0
    r1 + h = r1
</code></pre>
Thus it is unavoidable that if the representable numbers are not equally spaced then we can find a and x such that:<p><pre><code>    a + x == a
    a - x != a
</code></pre>
The above argument still goes through even if d0>d1, or if we want things to round down, or if we want things to round up, and we leave it as an exercise for the interested reader to check the details in those cases.<p>Now you have three choices:<p>* Reject this, because it contradicts your belief that floating point numbers must behave in the same way as real, mathematical numbers;<p>* Demonstrate a logical flaw in the argument; or<p>* Accept the conclusion, even though it contradicts your belief that floating point number behave in the same way as real, mathematical numbers, and accept that floating point numbers are just a model of mathematical numbers.",1429768562

9425162,comment,9422033,9422033,0,0,ismail,,,"This is very interesting, I have over 10 years experience working in the mobile telecoms industry. Here are my theories on how this could change the market/analysis:<p>1. This reduces the friction in switching networks, no &#x27;SIM Card&#x27; Lock in. It&#x27;s a pain to keep having to switch sim cards. Some people carry 2 phones here in Africa so they can take advantage of different deals by different carriers.<p>2. Due to Point 1, This will face push back from carriers<p>3. Unless there is some incentive for them to get this carriers want to make switching costs as high as possible. To avoid churn.<p>If it succeeds:<p>4. This changes the game in voice calling. Currently you sim is linked to a specific carrier, you only logon to their network all traffic (Local, International Voice, SMS, Data) is carried by them. What if you could route International calls traffic via X, and then local calls via Y?<p>5. WhatsAPP is most likely the company that will get the largest payoff from this. They are a few years ahead of everyone else, and have just launched voice calling.<p>6. Super-normal profits are over for operators<p>7. Actual Network quality (vs marketing about network quality) will become more important.<p>8. This will create an opportunity for players that are focused purely on network quality, and not marketing.<p>9. Carriers spend tons on marketing, failed product launches etc. At times this outstrips their engineering spend. Some even believe this is not a core competency and outsource IT/Engineering. Any carrier that does the opposite, could disrupt the incumbents<p>10. The base-stations (BSS/BSC) becomes more valuable, companies that own these have high value assets. They could then lease it out to other players. A few years back operators in Africa were selling off their base stations to American Towers [0] to fund their marketing budgets. At the time, i thought this was not a very good decision. Now i am convinced it was a terrible decision. The network of base stations is probably one of the most valuable assets a carrier has.<p>If i think of anything else, will post back here.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.americantower.com/corporateus/global-country-selector/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americantower.com/corporateus/global-country-sele...</a>",1429767539

So this kind of put Sonar (and others) in a bad position because not only do they have the regular challenges that every Startup faces, they also had to deal with a negative perception of the concept in general (which was forward thinking at the time). I believe this greatly influenced the growth rate and adoption of many Ambient Social Discovery Apps/Services.<p>Disclaimer: I bootstapped a competitor to Sonar, Highlight, and Glancee during this time period, but we never made it to Launch (problems with execution).

technology (IT).<p>(A) Bluntly likely none of those people
knows anyone at First Round Capital.  (B)
Bluntly, with the exception of Howard
Morgan, the qualifications of the people
at First Round Capital in business,
research academics, and technology are not
high enough to be respected by the people
I know.  Net, the people at First Round
Capital and myself know nearly none of the
same people.<p>Moreover, for my technology startup, there
is no one at First Round Capital with
business, academic, or technology
qualifications good enough for me to hire
for a significant position.
I&#x27;d have a tough time respecting any of
them to take their <i>advice</i> on my startup.<p>Once, just once, I did call a person I
know, the founder, COB, CEO of a major,
world famous company and asked for an
introduction to his CIO.  The CIO and I
talked and had a nice review of history, and
he gave me an introduction to a partner at
a venture firm with a partner on the BoD
of the company.  Net, the introduction
meant nothing -- the venture partner paid
no attention to the introduction or my
project at all; we did communicate but
just as in a <i>cold call</i>.<p>I never again wanted to bother any of the
high end people I know, bother them to
<i>introduce</i> me to a venture firm just to
get past some absurd <i>hoop</i> the venture
firm erected but ignored.<p>Net, venture firms who want
<i>introductions</i> get put at the bottom of
my list; the venture partners and I nearly
never know or respect the same people; I&#x27;m
not going to pester the good, important
people I know and respect to have them
waste their time communicating with people
as poorly qualified in business, research,
and IT as all but a small number of
venture partners.  No way.<p>Next, in contacting venture firms just via
<i>cold calls</i>, I&#x27;ve had little trouble
getting through and getting a response
including several hour long conference
calls.  In particular well known venture
partners at well known venture firms are
aware of my work on my project, all
without any <i>introductions</i>.<p>Net, it appears to me that <i>introductions</i>
are not really necessary and not very
helpful.<p>What was helpful was having a <i>team</i>:  For
a while I did that, but too soon I
encountered the common problem --
disputes.  So, now I&#x27;m a solo founder.
There are some serious advantages being a
solo founder, but it does appear that
getting a phone conversation with a
venture partner as a solo founder is more
difficult.  For whatever reasons, venture
firms don&#x27;t like solo founder startups.<p>Moreover, it appears to me that, really,
venture firms have their feet locked in
concrete that, with only some rare
exceptions, they just will not pay much
attention to an IT startup before the
software is developed and there is
significant <i>traction</i> growing rapidly.
E.g., venture partner Fred Wilson at his
Union Square Ventures recently made it
clear on his blog AVC.com that he just
will not fund software development.  Okay
by me.<p>But at<p><a href=""http://a16z.com/2014/07/30/the-happy-demise-of-the-10x-engineer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a16z.com/2014/07/30/the-happy-demise-of-the-10x-engin...</a><p>with<p>&quot;The Happy Demise of the 10X Engineer&quot;<p>By Sam Gerstenzang<p>is in part:<p>&quot;This is the new normal:  fewer engineers
and dollars to ship code to more users
than ever before.  The potential impact of
the lone software engineer is soaring.
How long before we have a billion-dollar
acquisition offer for a one-engineer
startup?  How long before the role of an
engineer, artisanally crafting custom
solutions, vanishes altogether?&quot;<p>So, Andreessen-Horowitz is admitting the
possibility of a solo founder creating a
billion dollar startup.<p>I don&#x27;t see just why not:  Venture firms
want the code written and traction
significant and growing rapidly.  If the
startup is ad supported, then it doesn&#x27;t
take much traction to let a solo (single)
founder startup have cash enough for
<i>organic growth</i>, that is, without equity
funding.  Then, if enough of the 3+
billion Internet users like the work a
lot, presto, bingo, a billion dollar
startup.<p>Indeed, for my startup, I believe that, as
the founder, I need to &quot;know my business&quot;
(a traditional criterion), and that
includes the code, the servers, how to
please the users, how to please the paying
customers, how to handle the billing,
bookkeeping, accounting, legal, etc.  So,
I&#x27;m not seeing where a larger <i>founding
team</i> is necessary.  First hire?  Likely
an Office Manager, and not a <i>co-founder</i>.<p>There is some irony:  Necessarily venture
firms are looking for highly exceptional
projects, but their means of looking are
mostly to compare with simplistic patterns
from the past -- not promising.  And as in<p><a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limited-partners-must-accept-blame-for-poor-longterm-returns-from-venture-capital-says-new-kauffman-report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/institutional-limit...</a><p>and<p><a href=""http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html#disqus_thread"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2013/02/venture-capital-returns.html...</a><p>on average the venture firms are not
making much money doing this.<p>Thankfully the US NSF, NIH, DARPA, various
other parts of the US DoD, commonly ignore
simplistic patterns from the past and,
instead, actually get expert evaluations
of projects submitted on paper.  Moreover,
the history is that projects that do well
on such evaluations have much better
<i>batting average</i> or <i>ROI</i> than US IT
venture capital.<p>E.g., for the Manhattan Project, the US
DoD (then the War Department) didn&#x27;t
reject the project because it looked
nothing like the long history of bombs.<p>The CIA didn&#x27;t reject the SR-71 because it
looked very different from anything in the
past of aviation.<p>The US Navy didn&#x27;t reject the first
satellite navigation system because it
looked nothing like anything in the
history of navigation.<p>NSF prize winning research rarely looks
much like the past.<p>The Human Genome project funded by the NIH
looked very different from anything in the
past.<p>Intel is shooting for 10nm -- again, <i>new
ground</i> significantly different from
anything in the past.<p>But only a tiny fraction of US IT venture
partners have the ability, say, of a
project reviewer for a leading
peer-reviewed journal of original research
or the NSF or NIH, to review leading-edge
technical material.  That&#x27;s been their
business model.  Okay.<p>Yes, venture firms on their Web sites
commonly claim to have &quot;deep domain
knowledge&quot;.  Curious:  Only a tiny
fraction of US IT venture partners have
the qualifications even to be admitted to
the graduate program where I got my Ph.D.<p>Indeed, Google search<p>&quot;deep domain knowledge&quot; venture<p>gives &quot;About 40,600 results&quot;.  I&#x27;ve read
the backgrounds of hundreds of US IT
venture partners, and I doubt that I&#x27;ve
seen over 10 that have the qualifications
for &quot;deep domain knowledge&quot; in anything
very technical.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of
lawyers, history majors, MBAs,
international studies majors, English
majors, etc. and darned few math, physics,
engineering, or computer science majors.<p>It looks like in their educations, only a
tiny fraction of the US IT VCs liked the
STEM fields.<p>I published a paper in computer science.
The paper has a typo.  Here I make a
public bet, of one dollar, that no US IT
venture partner on their own can find the
typo.  Should such a person wish to try,
then reply here, and I will send a PDF of
the paper.<p>Hint:  It would be good to be able to
find, say,<p>Patrick Billingsley, &#x27;Convergence of
Probability Measures&#x27;<p>fun and easy reading, and for that should
have greatly enjoyed, say, at least the
first (<i>real</i>) half of<p>Walter Rudin, &#x27;Real and Complex Analysis&#x27;<p>and<p>Walter Rudin, &#x27;Principles of Mathematical
Analysis&#x27;.<p>Come on US IT VCs:  You&#x27;ve got &quot;deep
domain knowledge&quot;, high determination, are
all-go, never stop, never give up,
commonly leap tall buildings at a single
bound, have over the top self esteem, etc.
Should be a piece of cake for you, right?<p>I&#x27;ll save you some time:<p>(A) Look up the definitions of
countability and of a sigma algebra.  Then
show that there are no countably infinite
sigma algebras.<p>(B) For positive integer n, the real
numbers R, R^n with the usual topology,
and subset C of R^n closed in that
topology, show that there exists function
f:  R^n --> R zero on C, positive
otherwise, and infinitely differentiable.
Notice that examples of C include Cantor
sets of positive measure, the Mandelbrot
set, and sample paths of Brownian motion.
Curious result.<p>If you find (A) and (B) easy, then by all
means, also with your &quot;deep domain
knowledge&quot;, read Rudin and go for the
typo also using Billingsley.<p>What does the paper with the typo have to
do with IT?  It&#x27;s likely the best thing so
far for detecting <i>zero day</i> problems in
large server farms and networks.<p>Point:  Only a tiny fraction of US IT
venture partners have the &quot;deep domain
knowledge&quot; necessary to evaluate new work
in information technology.<p>So, they have to evaluate based mostly
just on <i>traction</i>.<p>As far as I can tell, nearly everything
else US IT VCs say they want to see is
just smoke to cover the one thing they
really want -- traction significant and
growing rapidly.<p>Point:  Due to the possibility of a solo
founder with tiny burn rate, waiting for
<i>traction</i> will be too late.<p>Can a solo founder of an IT startup hope
to be successful without equity funding?
Should be:  All across the US, cross roads
to the largest cities, solo founders do
well mowing grass, selling pizza or
hamburgers, pumping gas, paving driveways,
..., <i>big-truck, little-truck</i> distribution
businesses, etc. without equity funding.
IT should be an advantage.",1429765474

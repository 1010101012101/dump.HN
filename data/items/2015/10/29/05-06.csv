Many of the inner loops that take up most of the active cycles on a CPU today (crypto, compression, imaging, signal processing, linear algebra) have very specific code patterns that are can be targeted with specialized instructions that provide integer-multiple reductions in instruction count.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that application-targeted instructions can reduce the size of the inner loops in these applications by 2x.  Even the RISCiest cores do not, in practice, run at 2x the clock speed or 2x the issue rate of cores with application-targeted instructions.  Thus, ISAs with baked in support for these use-case accelerating instructions will be more performant.<p>The RISCy core probably wins on mm^2, but a perf/mm^2 analysis will be highly dependent on how well designed the application-specific instructions are for area conservation.",1446098133

Perhaps someone here can explain to me what actually happens in a specific case for Haswell or some other recent processor?<p>Assume I have a list of id&#x27;s, and each id is the index into array of strings.   The strings are 0-terminated, and of uniform random length from 1-32 bytes.   I want to create an output buffer that consists of the concatenated strings corresponding to the id&#x27;s in the list.<p>The pseudo C code would look like this:<p><pre><code>  char *stringList[NUM_STRINGS];    // strings of length 1-32\n  int idList[LIST_LEN]; // initialized to rand() % NUM_STRINGS\n  for (int i = 0; i < LIST_LEN; i++) {\n    int id = idList[i];             // id from existing list\n    char *string = stringList[id];  // use id to get string\n    while (*output++ = *string++);  // copy string to output\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAssume that stringList is large enough that the strings are not in cache, and thus there will be a ~300 cycle latency after each is loaded.  Presumably, the &quot;copy&quot; loop will be speculatively executed during this latency.  But since the string lengths are random, the termination for this loop can&#x27;t be well predicted, and since the data for the copy isn&#x27;t there yet, I&#x27;m not sure exactly what happens.<p>Does the processor predict that the string copy loop will never terminate, and keep buffering string copy instructions until the buffers are full?  Which buffers? Does it stop speculating at some maximum number of branches? If so, what is this depth? Or does it manage to guess that the inner string copy loop terminates after some reasonable number of iterations so it can issue the outer loop load for the next stringList[id]?  If so, how many such loads will it manage to issue?",1446097007

A developer&#x27;s personal tooling preference that might not be shared by others is not &quot;of the nature of the project&quot; — the project itself doesn&#x27;t cause a developer to have an affinity for a particular tool; these belong in an exclude file, usually the user&#x27;s global excludes file[1].<p>.DS_Store is an example of this: this is a file caused by the tools you&#x27;re using to develop with, which are likely particular to you. My system does not generate these files. For the same reason, I wouldn&#x27;t include vim swap files[2]. A &quot;.pyc&quot; ignore in a Python project, or a <i>.o ignore in a C project, however, is correct, because the nature (in this case, the language in use) of the project </i>causes* that ignore to be needed. Ask yourself who needs the file ignored: The project (.gitignore), or you (exclude)?<p>The big benefit is that you need only exclude (or ignore) the file once: .DS_Store is likely not only invalid in one repo, but in <i>all</i> repos. So exclude it globally. Also, the rest of us aren&#x27;t wondering &quot;what&#x27;s a .DS_Store?&quot; `man gitignore` has a decent passage about when to use which.<p>[1]: See `man gitignore`, and `man git-config`&#x27;s `core.excludesFile`.<p>[2]: &quot;.⋆.sw⋆&quot;, which is all too often &quot;.⋆.swp&quot; or &quot;⋆.swp&quot; (note: unicode magic here to avoid special meaning of &quot;⋆&quot;…; also, HN strips out U+2736-7&#x27;s?)",1446095247

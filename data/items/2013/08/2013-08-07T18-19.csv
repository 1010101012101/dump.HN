Real estate is a store of value also, but nobody uses land or buildings as currency.<p>Once upon a time, gold was used as currency.  Merchants would have scales, weights, and other equipment needed to deal in gold.  That is not how gold is used in today&#x27;s world; there are only a few highly niche markets where gold is used as currency, and everywhere else you have either fiat currency or currency that is backed by gold (with fiat currency being vastly more popular these days).<p>It is also wrong to separate printed money from the rest of the money supply when you are talking about fiat currency.  Paper money is just a representation of the currency; the value of a dollar bill is equal to the value of four quarters and equal to the value of a bank account with one dollar in it.  Fiat currency is an abstraction created by laws, which is implemented in various ways (paper money, coins, electronic transactions, etc.).",1375901951

Why do you think advertising is a nearly half-trillion dollar industry worldwide?  It&#x27;s a significant chunk of GDP in the US and UK, for example, and not without reason: advertising through various media consistently makes a measurable impact on the buying patterns of consumers, and it&#x27;s not exactly a huge leap to apply this to politics[0].<p>That point aside, I appreciate the insight, and I think you&#x27;re on the right track as far as thinking about how to make the issues more concrete to people in a personal way.<p>The other, perhaps over-broad human nature question is how to get people care about this shit even if it truly only affects &quot;others&quot; - people of other countries, other social classes, other races and other religions.  There are middle-aged, upper class voting people, white ones even, who care deeply that their government detains and tortures mulsim men in secret and not-so-secret prisons without trial, who care if activists are targeted for intimidation or treated similarly to terrorists, who can look at history and see that pervasive surveillance without meaningful oversight is always, <i>always</i> abused at some point and who aren&#x27;t so scared of terrorism that they vote all their own rights away in order to feel safe.  That is a much harder battle.<p>[0] <a href=""http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-marketer-year/131810/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adage.com/article/moy-2008/obama-wins-ad-age-s-market...</a>",1375901482

It&#x27;s kind of part of the unwritten deal no one has ever discussed.  As a society we work together because as a group we&#x27;re stronger then individually.  Its true for animals, and its true for us.  Humans have a knack though for really making use of our intelligence, and physical capabilities.  We&#x27;ve engineered (hacked) the physical world to make our lives better.  Doing that alone though is impossible, so we&#x27;ve engineered &quot;society&quot; to facilitate the process.  When the industrial revolution happened, a debate kind of started.  What is more important, a persons right to work for stuff, or a persons right to more stuff?  By allowing the mechanization of labor, we&#x27;ve implicitly chosen the later.  Of course, it was easy to justify.  There&#x27;s always more work, so industrialization is ultimately a good thing.  The worker would only be temporarily shifted anyways.<p>There&#x27;s a caveat to that though.  When mechanization became intelligent mechanization (what I call having a Computer whether mechanical or digital control the process) the shifts started happening more frequently, and the replacement jobs became harder to obtain.<p>I think ultimately this is the key point, as a society we LET mechanization happen, and ultimately it has taken us to a point where not everyone is CAPABLE of having a highly skilled job.  There&#x27;s ways to alleviate it, part of the problem is an outdated education system.  Another part of the problem is probably cultural, there might be a lack of high skilled jobs too.<p>None the less, there WILL be a growing population of people who we&#x27;ve taken away their capability to work for a living.  So when we offer a basic income, its not us graciously giving them a gift of our hard work.  Its giving them the lives they are owed because of the decisions we have collectively made a hundred years ago.",1375901312

It isn&#x27;t just the choices we make, but  our very ideology that is devouring us (so to speak). We believe in the free market and competition. We&#x27;re capitalists. We used to be capitalists mostly within our own borders. Now technology has transformed our chains of distribution and communication to the point where we&#x27;re capitalists with no borders.

Bluetooth solutions will have a hard time competing with UHF RFID on these properties -- and that&#x27;s key for certain applications. However, there are definitely benefits to an alternative solution like wireless triangulation.  For example, even the best UHF tag localization algorithms produce error bounds on the order of 0.5 meters (there are workarounds for mobile robots). Plus, the Bluetooth solution doesn&#x27;t require the reader to be mobile -- you can take a single measurement and get a decent pose estimate.<p>I still share a lot of your concerns: if this is using triangulation, you&#x27;ll need multiple base stations (ie. infrastructure costs); many similar systems require extensive calibration; and the effects of multipath, diffusion, and fading can be very tricky to characterize.<p>As for mapping... SLAM mapping using ultra-low cost laser rangefinders [2] is nearing triviality, and even onboard visual SLAM is becoming imminently feasible. Anyway... happy to speak more offline.

Here&#x27;s one from a year and a half ago:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3654830"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3654830</a><p>I was not, by any measure, the first to highlight this.  The issue has been hotly debated on the chromium forum since at least 2008.  Yes, FIVE years ago.<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1397"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1397</a><p>The Guardian reveals utter ignorance by declaring that this fellow &quot;discovered the flaw&quot;.<p>I felt compelled to post a comment on the Guardian.  Here is is:<p><a href=""http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/25827439"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/25827439</a><p>Before anyone goes for my throat, look, I realize that browsers need to have access to the unencrypted data in order to fill out forms.  I get that.  However, Google/Chrome ought to give me the choice to have to enter a master password every time that data is requested.  In other words, the browser should not, independent of my input, have access to my encrypted data.<p>With this comes the possibility of perhaps allowing some passwords to be unencrypted.  I make a distinction between a password for non critical sites (i.e.: posting comments on The Guardian) and financially or personally critical services such as bank accounts, various developer accounts, payroll services, etc.  I could and should be able to tell the browser which non-critical logins could be stored without encryption and, therefore, available to the browser without my authorization.  Everything else should be secure.<p>If they enabled a master password they&#x27;d probably deal with 75% to 99% of the cases where an average user&#x27;s machine could be accessed by what I am going to call a hypothetical evil ten year old kid.  If you loose your laptop or leave it behind at the coffee shop this can also be a good layer of protection for anyone but those intent on stealing your private information.<p>Locking your workstation isn&#x27;t a solution.  You can break into a Windows machine in a few minutes by using software that removes user passwords.  Very easy.  I have a disk with such software (legally purchased, not some obscure warez-site crap) for use when an employee leaves and forgets to unlock their workstation (or leaves it locked intentionally).  Telling people that they ought to log out and have passwords on their user accounts is pointless.  Getting past user logins is stupid-easy.<p>I am mostly talking about what I&#x27;ve come to refer to as the &quot;Uncle Fester&quot; user.  A bit of humor there but not a pejorative at all.  This includes my mother, uncle, local school teacher, cop, soccer coach.  Anyone who is not tech savvy and has no clue whatsoever about what is going on and what the potential risks might be.  They only know enough about computers to push the mouse around and use it and maybe a little bit above that.  This, again, is not a pejorative.  We can&#x27;t expect or demand that the average computer user be a CS grad with a minor in security.  That&#x27;s just not reality.<p>On the assumption that my proposed user profile is on point, we, then, are responsible for guiding them towards safe usage.  This means both informing as well as providing them with tools to help protect them.  Taking a Silicon Valley CS-expert academic view of the world is not helpful to anyone.  A simple master password would remove a huge layer of risk for most users.  It&#x27;s that simple.<p>And, of course, the browser is exactly where the user ought to be educated about the choices he or she has to make.  You should not be able to store passwords casually without having to read a few single-sentence pages explaining the consequences of what you are about to do.  I say a few single-sentence pages because if you fill a page with text people will treat it just like a TOS page and click through without reading any of it.<p>Here&#x27;s one potential sequence.  Each sentence is displayed in large print against a white background.  The button used to advance from one screen to the next would have an activation delay of several seconds in order to prevent the user from rapidly clicking through these pages.<p><pre><code>  &quot;Saving passwords in the browser can be risky&quot;

That is a basic instrument to ascertain legality of government actions. However, if we talk about improving the level of &#x27;trust&#x27; in institutions, that is a whole different level. We can&#x27;t possibly stop there. Gaining and maintaining &#x27;trust&#x27; means a lot more than simply acting in a legal way and takes more then just verification. I consider a basic need for establishing trust also the analysis of their motivation behind certain choices. Government officials are not just &#x27;citizens&#x27;, and their agencies are not private companies. While the private citizens and companies can do whatever they want which is not considered illegal, public officials and agencies are governed by a different concept: they have a specific mandate/scope and can only perform in that narrow path. They should not exploit policy wording to perform questionable actions; especially if such policies are classified and only a restricted number of people has the ability to review and assess them. If the government wants to conquer back some form of trust by the public opinion, not only it should improve transparency, but should  also steer from this farce of hiding their real intentions behind legalese and wordplay contained in all the latest security related policies.",1375899399

6174442,comment,6173282,6173545,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a valid point, but I think it misses the reasoning slightly.<p>Much of markets are perceptions, and as everyone knows if you are a &#x27;hot&#x27; startup there has been a tradition of the entrenched folks seeding fear, uncertainty, and doubt into the market to slow down your growth. If you are too open with what you are doing you give those who would have you not be successful time to construct a story about why you are a risk or shouldn&#x27;t be trusted. Further, you get &#x27;pre-announcements&#x27; which can make you feel like a &#x27;me too&#x27; company rather than &#x27;we&#x27;re the first to be doing this.&#x27;<p>A recent example was that Apple Maps was launching with some new 3D features, word got out that this was part of the announcement and Google apparently rushed their map announcement ahead of Apple&#x27;s to capture that aura of &#x27;first mover.&#x27; (Clearly Google was already working on similar features but they moved their announcement to change the message that people heard in the media)<p>So if you are a startup working on &quot;X&quot; and BigCo could do X if they were investing time and money into it, and your &#x27;buzz&#x27; was high and a lot of people were starting to like what they saw as you got closer to launch. It is very possible for BigCo to hold a press conference on the &quot;future of X&quot; with their vision of how it will work, and when you launch all the questions are &quot;well how does that compare to BigCo&#x27;s vision of X?&quot; and the answer &quot;Well they aren&#x27;t even working on it while we are here delivering it so I can&#x27;t really say&quot; doesn&#x27;t come across as &#x27;leadership&#x27; so much as &#x27;sour grapes.&#x27;<p>The OP focusses on the technology aspects of Stealth, which is to say that if you can&#x27;t say what you are working on because the barriers to entry are so low as to make anyone a potential competitor, <i>that</i> is not a business. But the marketing message risk, regardless of technology, is <i>very</i> high. So stealth is definitely warranted if you are at risk of being marginalized quickly by the players you are choosing to disrupt.",1375898568

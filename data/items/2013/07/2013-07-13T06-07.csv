Because they&#x27;re young they don&#x27;t have experience nor families to take care of, and thus will take low wages. They don&#x27;t demand too many benefits, and you can work them like mules. They also flood the market and are over supplied and under demanded. The average game developer is a 31 year old white male. As soon as they start settling down and wanting to have a family they leave the industry. They burn out, and they are replaced.<p>It&#x27;s not the &quot;right&quot; way for every company.

6036921,comment,6033567,6036651,1,0,whiterabbit2,,,"I have saved a really good booklet from my past employer about sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is actually gender neutral, and it doesn&#x27;t have to be about sexual advances. Moreover, a man can be harassed by another man, as much as much as a woman can be harassed by another woman (happens way too often in my experience). The legal definition says harassment should be both severe enough and impose gender inequality (i.e. telling dirty jokes to both men and women doesn&#x27;t constitute sexual harassment as long as they are not more derogatory to one gender). The problem is that there are too many stereotypes about sexual harassment, some are spread by corporations themselves (because they try to avoid lawsuits, nothing to do with employee fair treatment).",1373697992
6036920,comment,6033567,6036462,1,0,jack-r-abbit,,,"It would be great to see this more. It could provide some interesting data. I would be interested to hear if anonymized resumes closed the gender gap for getting an interview or not. It could also expose a possible bias if the gender gap closed for getting a first interview but then the gap simply shifted up one level when it came to the second step of the process (ie, disproportionately more men move on to a second interview). Although, it might actually be harder to show a bias at that level since a lot of the interview process has to do with how well the person sells themselves, articulates their answers, presents themselves physically (ie, dressed appropriately), etc. These things also happen to be very subjective so it is kind of difficult to prove there was a bias. Which is also why it is equally difficult to prove there was <i>not</i> a bias. (Did you not get hired because of your gender? Or just because you didn&#x27;t interview well?) I have no doubt that people get turned down based on unimportant &quot;qualifications&quot; like gender, race, age, etc. And that is wrong. But I also have no doubt that some people who felt they were turned down for one of those reason actually just wasn&#x27;t qualified or blew the interview and don&#x27;t think to look internally before they look around them.",1373697962

He never talked.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty massive assumption. I&#x27;d say Nixon resigned because he would have been impeached based of the evidence, regardless of whether the whistleblower was outed or not. In the same way, I suspect the numerous NSA programs will come under scrutiny of the <i>true</i> supreme court, regardless of whether we know Snowden&#x27;s name or not.<p>If anyone is to blame for the story&#x27;s focus vacillating between Snowden and the various programs or allegiances exposed, it is the media outlets that cannot maintain their own integrity in the face of advertising revenue. I&#x27;d suspect that was part of the point of his coming out publicly. That and the fact that, in appropriating the data he did, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption that he left a massive access trail that the authorities wouldn&#x27;t be far behind in tracing.<p>We still would have heard about Mr. Snowden.

6036870,comment,6024383,6029957,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"<i>It&#x27;s not hard. Just need some energy.</i>  Well, energy is specifically the problem.<p>You <i>also</i> need feedstocks. <i>And</i> a source of CO2.  <i>And</i> limits on fossil CO2 emissions.  That last pretty much rules out any use of fossil (or methane hydrate) sources and requires you stick to present cycling carbon within the carbon cycle (biomass, atmosphere).<p>If your time horizon is more than decades to a century or so, feedstocks rules out petroleum (which doesn&#x27;t make sense anyway), natural gas, or coal.<p>Conventional non-breeder uranium reactors will suffer from fuel shortages if used for significant amounts of power generation well within a century.  Thorium breeders offer a possible alternative, though the technology is unproven.  Fusion is even more unproven.<p>Which leaves solar, wind, wave, and geothermal, all of which have distinctly limited upper bounds, and very considerable infrastructure requirements.  Yes, we could get all the energy we need from solar by covering 0.5 - 1% of the Earth&#x27;s surface with collectors.  It&#x27;s helpful to note that the built environment -- cities, towns, and villages, is on the order of this size.  So we&#x27;re talking about effectively <i>doubling</i> the size of the built environment (though in some cases solar infrastructure can be built over existing structures), <i>with a much more technically complex instance</i> (solar PV arrays, inverters, and power transmission infrastructure are more complex and demanding than ordinary buildings and structures).  That&#x27;s ... a pretty major undertaking, even if we grant ourselves several decades to complete it.<p>Energy <i>is</i> the problem.<p>On top of that, Fischer-Tropsch plant and capital are expensive and would take a long time and vast investments (trillions of dollars) to replace the 20 million barrels of oil consumed <i>daily</i> in the US.<p><i>Nuclear powered aircraft</i>  You&#x27;re side-stepping your original statement.  Producing hydrocarbons at that scale from electricity is unproven.  Producing <i>hydrogen</i> might work, and for aircraft (limited in number, limited in servicing points) could prove viable, though with significantly more airframe volume devoted to fuel storage, and with much more complex storage parameters -- most likely LH2 -- than existing fuels.<p><i>Solar powered airships</i>  I&#x27;d suspect that either PV costs would come down, or array designs would be designed to be transferrable between airships, or both.  My point was to demonstrate that where solar powered heavier-than-air craft are only <i>just</i> feasible (see the Solar Impulse, with the wingspan of a 747 but just able to carry a pilot), solar-powered airships are highly feasible.  Of course, any fuel which would work for an HTA craft would <i>also</i> work for an airship.",1373695778

An entire &quot;audiophile&quot; system is easily in the 6 figure range.  If you&#x27;re into that kind of gear then obviously Bose must be low end equipment for you.<p>For the rest of us, though, I think you pay a little more for Bose and, for that, you get a little bit better sound.  It&#x27;s one step above consumer gear, but still well below audiophile gear.  I think it&#x27;s priced appropriately.",1373695576

2676965,comment,2674369,2674621,1,0,tzs,,,"Neither de-duplication nor web access require server-side encryption/decryption. Here's how you do a Dropbox-like service with all encryption handled by the clients, but that allows de-duplication and web access. Let's call the service DBL (for Dropbox-like).<p>1. Each user has a public/private key pair. This is generated client side, deterministically from the user name and password. The public key is stored on the DBL server.<p>2. To store a file on the DBL server, the client encrypts the file with, say, AES256, before sending the data to the server. The key is deterministically derived from the file contents, say by SHA256.<p>3. The client keeps a file that contains a mapping from files to their encryption keys. This file is encrypted using a public key system, with the public key being the user's public key. It is stored on the DBL server (and no doubt cached locally on the client).<p>The above is sufficient for non-shared files. When you wish to retrieve a file from a client other than the one it came from, the retrieval client can grab the file/key mapping file, decrypt it using your private key, and then lookup the decryption key for the file.<p>For files that are to be shared with specific people, the client maintains a file for each person you share with. In this file it stores the mappings of files to encryption keys for the files you are sharing with that person. This file is stored on the DBL server, encrypted with the public key of the person you are sharing with.<p>De-duplication is possible in this system because when two people store identical files, they pick the same encryption key, and so the end result is the same encrypted data.<p>Web access is possible, as long as Javascript is allowed on the client, by implementing the key retrieval and the AES decryption in Javascript.<p>Note that DBL never sees the unencrypted data, and they never see the encryption key for a file in plaintext--they only see it when it is encrypted via your public key (or the public key of someone you are sharing the file with). Even if they are breached, the crackers cannot get your data. Same goes for if they are subpoenaed--they can't give up your plaintext because they don't have access.<p>Note also that DBL doesn't actually need your user name. All they need is your public key (at least as far as operation of the file storage/retrieval/sharing system goes--they need more for billing if you are using paid services, of course).",1308619328

You can imagine how this is valuable to a business. It also takes a lot of experience, because even if you can mouth mantras like DRY and ""separation of concerns"" there's a lot of room left to screw up in exactly <i>how</i> you separate concerns. (And many developers aren't even familiar with those terms.)<p>Design a non-trivial web site with various user roles, which is actually secure even if you fully control the incoming HTTP requests from top to bottom. Sounds easy. Evidence suggests that the skills to pull this off are not found in every developer, though.<p>Correctly program a concurrent program with a significant UI, using only the tools readily available in traditional UI environments like Windows or Java. (It shouldn't be rocket science and I believe someday it won't be. But it is today. Arguably, this isn't even something a master developer can do, it's just something it takes a master developer to even come close to getting away with.)

Every time I dig deep into the framework and find something that doesn't work I get the feeling some Adobe engineer knew it was broken but their manager told them ship anyway.<p>My favorite lately was an Adobe plugin for Photoshop to export FXG files (FXG is Adobe's SVG used to build Flex graphics). If you run the script it doesn't even preserve text layers, it turns them into bitmaps instead. I could write that script in an hour, why even bother releasing it as a half baked feature?",1308618327
2676930,comment,2676670,2676869,21,0,ebiester,,,"...And that is the difference between a (good) teacher and a researcher who is conscripted into teaching.<p>A (good) teacher looks at a problem from as many aspects as possible and works with students to understand them. A (good) teacher collects multiple ways to understand a concept, so if one doesn't sink in, the next may. It's not an inborn skill; it takes practice.<p>The best way I've ever seen limits explained, incidentally, is taking a student 10 feet away from a wall. Ask the student to go half way to the wall. Then again. Then again. Eventually, the student is taking centimeter steps. Ask the student if he's at the wall. The student says yes or no, but usually, there is an ""aha!"" moment, the idea being that you can figure out where ""there"" is without ever technically being ""there.""<p>Understanding the basics of the derivative was the first place I banged my head, but that was because I didn't adequately understand the secant. Once I understood that, the derivative fell into place. (In fact, calculus was where I realized how much I didn't understand trigonometry.)",1308618324

What the author's post seems actually to be saying, with which I heartily agree, is obviousness is only in hindsight; deep things become trivial only because of the time you've put into understanding them.<p>On the other hand, I think the things that become obvious once you've understood them <i>tend</i> to be (though are not always) the things that have already been fairly well digested by others, and so are presented to you in a smooth, flowing way to which you just have to accustom yourself.<p>My experience with (mathematical) research is that understanding has a roughly equal possibility of meaning that you find it trivial, or that you finally understand all the (apparently) irreducibly complex difficulties.  Indeed, my feeling if anyone tells me that, say, DeligneLusztig representations are obvious is that he or she hasn't probably fully understood them (disclaimer:  neither have I, not even close, which may mean that I'm just illustrating the author's point).<p>I don't mean at all by this that you shouldn't go on searching for the 'obvious' simplificationthat way lies great insight.  (As someone said much more elegantly, if things aren't already obvious in mathematics, we tend to make them obvious by changing the definitions.)  What I mean is that you shouldn't drag yourself down by saying I thought I understood that, but it's hard, not obvious!",1308618104

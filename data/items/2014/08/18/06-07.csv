We&#x27;re on the same wavelength. You need to learn this topic, find out what&#x27;s going on in your own field. Your ignorance is embarrassing. And there is no &quot;science is supposed to be&quot; trope -- science has been clearly defined in the law, laws meant to keep Creationism out of public school classrooms, laws with requirements psychology cannot meet.<p>> Your rant about the DSM is completely off topic.<p>Say what? The DSM is the source for information about ADHD. NO DSM, no ADHD. This was true about Asperger&#x27;s as well, until it became too embarrassing and was removed from the new edition of the DSM. Asperger&#x27;s has recently been discarded <i>by being removed from the DSM</i>.<p>> I just can&#x27;t explain why you want to prove the non-existence of ADHD ...<p>What the fuck are you talking about? I never said ADHD is not real, I said it&#x27;s not science, and until it is, the NIMH will refuse to accept it or allow funds to be disseminated to study it. Those are the facts.<p>Prove me wrong -- locate where I claimed that ADHD isn&#x27;t real. In other words, imitate a scientist and locate some evidence for your false claims.<p>It&#x27;s not as though ADHD information is difficult to locate:<p>Link: <a href=""http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/adhd/problems-overdiagnosis-and-overprescribing-adhd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/adhd/problems-overdiagnosis-...</a><p>Title: &quot;Problems of Overdiagnosis and Overprescribing in ADHD&quot;<p>Quote: &quot;Doubt and confusion as to where this disorder fits into the general spectrum of illness further feeds the general perception that <i>ADHD is a socially constructed disorder rather than a valid neurobiological disorder</i>. -- With the production of more stimulants every year, worries about the increased availability of stimulants for abuse and diversion rise as well. Rising production rates are cited as <i>proof of stimulant overprescribing by physicians and indirect evidence of the overdiagnosis of ADHD among children</i>.&quot;<p>I emphasize the above doesn&#x27;t constitute science evidence for or against anything, only that your claim that ADHD is a solidly established disorder backed by reliable research is, simply put, a lie.<p>> If you were inclined to listen to scientific evidence ...<p><i>There is no scientific evidence</i>, and it&#x27;s time for your to learn something about science. This is why the NIMH has decided to reject the DSM -- it&#x27;s become an embarrassment.<p>> ... you will probably find some reason, why this evidence is not clear enough to draw conclusions you donb&#x27;t like.<p>AS does the NIMH, and for excellent reasons -- scientifically clueless people like you who take positions out of ignorance.<p>Prove me wrong. Name the property that all scientific findings and theories must possess to be regarded as science (a property included in the laws that define science). It can be expressed in a single word, and it&#x27;s something psychological research lacks in droves.<p>> &quot;DSM contains conditions which don&#x27;t have physical/physiological manifestations&quot; is not proof for ADHD not existing.<p>And? I never claimed anywhere that ADHD doesn&#x27;t exist. I do say that, until we know what it is, we cannot meaningfully treat it. And the above quotation from the literature fully supports my position.<p>Now stop lying. ADHD is neither true nor false, it&#x27;s in limbo because <i>there is no science</i> being done.<p>> For one thing, because these physical and physiological features have been well studied...<p>So your claim is that if something is well studied, then ipso facto it must be real. If that were true, it would make astrology real -- it&#x27;s certainly been well studied.<p>Learn science -- stop embarrassing yourself.",1408344911

8191627,comment,8183244,8191514,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"This is going to begin in a somewhat disorganized fashion.<p>You can &quot;misleadingly describe&quot; something by leaving information out, as when I describe fatally shooting someone as &quot;discharging a firearm&quot;. But that isn&#x27;t just phrasing something in a way that makes it sound better, that&#x27;s leaving information out.<p>In all the examples you&#x27;ve discussed, one of the component actions is a violation on its own; it&#x27;s not possible to decompose them into actions which are <i>actually innocuous</i> (as opposed to &quot;phrased to sound innocuous&quot;). There is an element of illegality which remains present as you decompose the offense. That isn&#x27;t true for the case of spraying your legally-obtained Roundup-ready wheat with Roundup.<p>It appears to me that the reasoning here goes &quot;if we do the obvious thing, a patent on Roundup-ready wheat will be worthless, and so therefore we need to contort the legal system until such a patent has value&quot;. But that isn&#x27;t even a legal principle; it&#x27;s quite possible to obtain various privileges through the legal system such that the normal benefits of those privileges cannot be extracted (even if I have a trademark on White (tm) brand paper, I can&#x27;t stop other paper vendors from calling theirs white).<p>The need to contort the legal system is an indication that patents on wheat varieties are a bad idea. At root, this is because wheat has volition of its own; it wants to spread. There is analogous law for animals which makes the owner responsible for what (say) his dog does; if that system were adopted here, the licensed RR-wheat grower would be liable for something like facilitating or contributing to patent infringement.<p>I&#x27;ve assumed that a situation where a crime can be decomposed into parts that are entirely legal represents an undesirable twisting of the legal system. The closest analogy I know is the crime of blackmail, which is composed of entirely legal actions (if you threaten to do something illegal, it&#x27;s actually a different crime, extortion). Legal scholarship is divided over blackmail; many people don&#x27;t think it should be criminal at all <i>precisely because it involves taking only legal actions</i>. This establishes a couple of things: (1) Even if you don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any value in the principle &quot;two non-crimes don&#x27;t make a crime&quot;, a lot of people do, which makes it a very reasonable criticism of a situation that violates it, and (2) crimes of this kind are extremely unusual, which means it&#x27;s definitely worthy of comment, and requires a little more justification than a typical law.<p>All of that is basically by way of saying the judgment represents a bad idea, and atypical law. The difficulties involved in giving meaning to a wheat patent suggest that we shouldn&#x27;t try -- it&#x27;s the same argument you see against drug and alcohol prohibition, price controls, commanding the tide to recede, etc.<p>Going back to the original comments, I responded to someone saying that &quot;Monsanto has sued someone for having his neighbor&#x27;s seeds blown into his field, and won&quot; was untrue. I maintain that the person I responded to was wrong, and his parent was correct, because it is acknowledged by all sides that, if his neighbor&#x27;s seeds hadn&#x27;t blown into his field, Schmeiser, taking the same actions he did take, would not have been violating Monsanto&#x27;s patent. The germination of his neighbor&#x27;s wheat, over which Schmeiser had no control, transformed his legal action into a crime.",1408344144

Looking at sodium consumption without taking into account potassium consumption also appears to be a major issue with lots of previous salt studies. We had people recommend putting 1500mg (DASH diet level) in MealSquares, but we feel confident not going below the 2400mg level for health.<p>Soylent ran into issues by including around a gram of salt in their 1.0 version with people getting dizzy from too little sodium in the diet.

It was easy (but annoying) to do at first but scaling up the clusters made it exponentially harder to do by hand in the terminal.<p>It was conceptually easy to solve once I abstracted the problem a bit: I had a rough idea of where I was getting the data from on the mining servers (urls, ocr&#x27;d pdfs , etc), and since there are a bunch of libraries out there for parsing json that give an idea of where the errors are occurring in the files by the byte, after that it was a combination of traversing file forwards and backwards (in memory, luckily files are only ~20mb each, but crashed every text editor I tried before trying to do search and replace) looking for any data within the file that could help me reconstruct the mal formatted object or remove the object if not enough information was available (which if I didn&#x27;t want to do if my error occurrence wasn&#x27;t ~10/100,000, I could use the other objects near it to reconstruct the object from inference).",1408343316

The code I inserted basically computes my string by &quot;encrypting&quot; the original string with some constants derived from the whole BIOS image, so if the BIOS was only partially modified it turns into rubbish, and if it was replaced, then the string reverts to the original one. The point is that the BIOS on that machine is globally unique, has a feature that I can easily identify, and would be difficult if not impossible to forge by an attacker with only the OEM BIOS. I came up with this shortly after the infamous CIH virus emerged.<p>Ditto for the NSA trying to flash a backdoored Coreboot: they would have to know exactly the customisations I made to my BIOS to replicate them, and if they did, then I&#x27;m probably pwned anyway.

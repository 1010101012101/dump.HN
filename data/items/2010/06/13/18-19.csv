But ""must""? That's a pretty unsupported moral claim and by no metrics rational.<p>Her focus on the individual is in itself a very naive interpretation of reality.<p>What individual is she talking about. No man is an island. The very existence of what we call individuals depends on so many factors from our ancestors to the existence of a live-able planet to the air we are breathing.<p>If anything she wrote self-help books. To call it philosophy would be a crime to philosophy.<p>Or what about A = A. Existence exist. But what is existence?

1427935,comment,1427599,1427845,0,0,DougBTX,,,"Yes, staying idiomatic is a good idea, it's worth pointing out explicitly.<p>As a tangent, while the original author was trying to abstract away the loop, I feel he left too many fragments of the loop behind, such as the start and end conditions. As such, I don't think the sum function is cheating too much, and is in fact the goal. I might describe the Total as ""the sum of the dies' face values,"" instead of the more verbose: ""the sum of the dies' face values, starting from the first die and ending at the last die.""<p>In a sense, this runs parallel to your reminder to stay idiomatic: when you sum a list of things, it is common to add them all together, not just some subset. It is this shared understanding which lets us be succinct.<p>Though I do fear that I'm preaching to the choir :-)",1276455430
1427934,comment,1427782,1427782,0,0,tansey,,,"I've used Drools: <a href=""http://www.jboss.org/drools/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jboss.org/drools/</a><p>It's a deductive rules engine for Java, so you give it some objects with state and apply a set of first-order(ish) logic rules to them, in an if-then kind of form. You can give rules different precedence levels to create a sort of cascading effect.<p>Rules are stored in plain text, but they're read in and compiled into memory for efficient execution. Defining your own DSL spec is a breeze. Your rules are executed in the rest of the application with a few simple method calls. It integrates with Java in a really slick way, so you can work with POJOs and your rules operate on them.<p>It's a pretty cool DSL creator, actually. I used it in a research project by integrating it with the Eclipse JDT and creating a DSL for source code manipulation. Then I hooked it up to a little inference algorithm we created, and the result was a plug-in which could take a before and after piece of code, analyze the difference between the two (specifically in the case of adding annotations to legacy code), and generate a set of Drools rules that could automatically migrate similar legacy classes.

1427921,comment,1427422,1427422,0,0,gxti,,,"As pointed out by others here already, SQL may not be the optimal fit for every scenario at large scales but it will nearly always work at smaller scales, and I can't imagine that you're already trying to write the next amazon.com. So in other words, start with SQL.<p>There are three main free software SQL databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. Don't use MySQL, it'll get you into a great deal of bad habits, is missing an ass-ton of useful features (the default engine doesn't even support transactions), and likes to corrupt data. It also has questionable licensing and is owned by Oracle (a commercial database vendor) which as you can imagine doesn't have a lot of incentive to improve it.<p>SQLite is a very robust database that is great for read-mostly sites (like blogs) and for embedding into applications (Firefox for example). Its primary limitation is that there can only be one writer at a time.  It is very easy to pick up and get going with since there's no persistent daemon, you just point it at a file and start writing. I'd recommend starting here.<p>PostgreSQL is the more featureful database and supports hundreds of concurrent connections, locking, access control, etc. This is the real ""workhorse"" database you're likely to find in production at large sites that do make use of free-software RDBMS. Eventually you will need to use something more powerful than SQLite, and this is probably it.",1276454892

1427895,comment,1427422,1427553,0,0,pbh,,,"I want to be careful in how I phrase this, because I feel like this was a good effort, but I disagree with many parts of this description.<p>First, databases are not ""just"" about persistence, and I don't mean that in a pedantic way.  The point of a database management system is to manage your data over time and allow you to make use of it.  This includes things like stating constraints to ensure that the data in the database is always correct and providing methods for querying your data at varying levels of complexity.<p>Second, there are a number of in-memory databases.  Oracle sells one.  SQLite is often used as one.  The fact that they are in-memory does not make them not databases.<p>Third, relational versus non-relational is not really an argument about ""how the data is stored on disk"" or about being ""standards compliant.""  A database traditionally consists primarily of three things: a data model, a query language, and an implementation.  A data model, like ""everything is a table with column headers and rows"" can be written to disk in many different ways and queried in many different ways.  (It's an abstraction.)  Indexing structures and data formats may be mostly the same even when the data model is different.  The (current) ""relational vs non-relational"" debate, such as it is, is usually about whether it makes sense to change the data model and query language in order to ensure that the implementation is scalable on ""cloud-like"" platforms with specific data access needs.  (That said, there are many different types of non-relational models and query languages designed for different purposes.)<p>Fourth, there isn't one SQL.  There are in fact a number of standards, SQL-86, SQL-89, SQL-92, and so on.  It makes sense to learn the standard first (at least up to 92 or so), rather than learning particular implementation specifics.  Most databases implement SQL-92 or above, though there is somewhat wide variance in additional features like indexing structures and functions and in data modeling languages.",1276454110

But education has also traditionally been a priority for society rather than simply individuals. Theoretically, the US as a whole benefits if tomorrow more-skilled US workers are paid the same amount for doing the same job than less-skilled US workers were doing yesterday.

In Haskell, to take the opposite extreme, ""foldl (+) (map dieSum dies) 0"" would be idiomatic (or would be if the sum function wasn't built in to Prelude as well but I feel that's cheating too much), whereas the closest equivalent to the loop approach in C++ would be grotesque and unidiomatic. How grotesque would be up to the user; you could go all the way to having the die values in an array and iterating an index through them if you like, but it'll make the C++ version of that look pretty sane.<p>The exact algorithms aren't the point. It's really something more like ""stay idiomatic in the language you are in and keep it simple"". Another example is when people start going nuts with lambda in Python; you're really not supposed to do that and there is almost always a better way that doesn't involve lambdas.",1276452472

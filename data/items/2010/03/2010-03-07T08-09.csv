You know your opinion is going to be unpopular, so the onus is upon you to expand upon that idea in your original post, otherwise it looks like you're just trolling.<p>In response to your later justification, though, most western societies have been patriarchal, so the fact that we've been very successful at fighting and killing each other is not an indication that women somehow would not if given the chance.<p>Your argument breaks down to this: since men are so bad at keeping the peace, women must therefore be better at it.",1267952173

Actually, they have already changed the world. How so?<p>I graduated high school in 1995.  At the time, a few people had email, but we didn't really use it to stay in touch.  When we graduated and went to different colleges, we pretty much lost touch.  We might see these people during break, but I stopped going home at break.<p>I've reconnected with a whole bunch of high school friends thanks to Facebook.<p>And you know what?  When you talk to kids that are graduating now, they don't identify loosing touch with their friends as a problem.  Even if they go to different schools, they just check out Facebook, and they are all caught up.  When they go home for break, they just pick up where they left off on Facebook the day before.",1267952014

1173085,comment,1172803,1173057,0,0,baguasquirrel,,,"As others have pointed out, we were screwed in the long term anyway.  We (1) ran deficits through the previous decade, (2) we left the interest rates too low for too long and (3) we went on a spending binge in all levels of society (consumers bought too much, banks lent too much).<p>The time for making the correct choices has long passed.  Now there are only bad choices and worse choices.  If we hadn't done (1) and (3), then running deficits right now would be a good option.  After a certain point, increases in debt begin to dampen growth in GDP, which means that the gov't won't be able to stimulus away the problem anymore.<p>In that light, the current administration is merely doing what makes sense.  Spend whatever amount of stimulus makes sense during their tenure because the economy will need it whether it's now or later.  Not spending it will mean that whoever is the challenger in 2012 may well win, and whoever the challenger is will probably dish out stimulus money in some form or another anyway.",1267950969

There may not be tons of ""proofs without words"" in it, but the book <i>Proofs from the Book</i> is a great example of a nice collection of elegant proofs of elementary propositions that convince at a level that's much more effective than a pure, logical demonstration.  Sure, you won't find these things in math journals -- you have to look in things like <i>Mathematics Magazine</i>, <i>College Mathematics Journal</i>, and various recreational mathematics and mathematics education journals.

9406539,comment,9403455,9406306,0,0,morgante,,,"I agree that abstinence-only sex education is harmful, but I&#x27;m not sure the same could be said of drug usage. There&#x27;s no reason that the majority of people would need or want drugs, and many go without, so it&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable assumption that most will not partake.<p>That being said, any education should still be honest—including explaining the exact harms of different drugs and, hopefully, in the process guiding future users towards safer choices. However, I don&#x27;t think that should be extended to include the corollary of condom usage—there&#x27;s no reason to educate people on how to use needles, for example.",1429513188

They are not.<p>Market pricing is exactly what a lot of utilities in the EU are now pushing for. Solar panel owners don&#x27;t like it, because market prices now frequently dip below zero when solar and wind peak simultaneously.<p>The second issue is the cost of providing and maintaining power transmission. Traditionally, the utilities just tack on transmission costs on the electricity costs. When everyone buys all their electricity from the utility, this is a reasonable compromise. However, when you get rooftop solar, the cost of providing power transmission to you doesn&#x27;t go down at all, yet your electricity purchases do go down.<p>A fairer way to price electricity transmission would probably be by your maximum draw from the grid, or by the size of the fuse that connects you to it.",1429512676

The purpose of education - again, IMHO - is to equip children with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in the wider world. Advertising has no place in this model.<p>The example given by gumby is particularly insidious. I could make the argument for including products that the children will be familiar with to make maths problems seem more applicable to the real world. However, knowing that the &quot;best-selling packaged cookie in the world is the Oreo cookie&quot; does nothing to enhance the child&#x27;s mathematical ability.<p>The Merchants of Venus by Frederick Pohl is a satirical SF story about the potential perils of runaway capitalism. I could see school districts experiencing rivalry depending on whether they are a &quot;Coke school&quot; or a &quot;Pepsi school&quot;. The last thing school systems need is yet another superficial basis for tribalism and rivalry.<p>There is one potential benefit that I can see. Advertisers would presumably pay money to schools for the privilege of advertising to such a malleable, captive audience. If this money were to be used to enhance the quality of education at the school, could it outweigh the damage caused by advertising to children? I&#x27;m not sure, but I doubt it.",1429512441

There are supervisory limits on what a bank can lend (leverage ratios, capital adequacy rations etc.).<p>>  By definition fractional reserve is lending more currency than you have.<p>No it is not, it is lending a fraction (less than 100%) of the money that has been deposited with you.<p>I think the confusion comes from that in todays banking system there are two sorts of money that seem very similar - the base money (federal bank notes) and the bank money (loans/deposits of federal bank notes).  The loans/deposits can also be used as money but crucially they are NOT the underlying money even if it is very easy to convert one to the other (depositing or withdrawing the base money).  Example: I can buy something with the fact that Chase bank owes me bank notes (with the loan I made to it), by changing the ownership of that loan to the shop I want to buy something from.  I have a bank card that makes that transfer very simple.<p>The 10:1 ratio is a limit on bank money (loans / deposits) to base money (federal bank notes).  Both sorts of money are denominated in dollars, but they are different and have different supply and demand.<p>To recap, by keeping careful records of the loans / deposits, and making systems to easily transfer ownership of the loans and deposits, these loans end up also having characteristics of money - they can be used for transactions, for accounting etc.<p>> You can&#x27;t do that with Bitcoin by design<p>You absolutely can.  The loans/deposits form of bank money could work with bitcoin as the base money, and you could have the same rules around fractional reserve, capital adequacy rules, liquidity ratio rules etc. that the normal banking system has.",1429511874

When you do this you either pay off some of the debt by removing some value from the product, or you spend ages just reaching &quot;value pairity&quot; at which point you&#x27;ve likely accrued a whole host of shiny new technical debt.<p>Per the top commenter (jewel), I have to agree that this article misses the most important chunk of the metaphor - interest. Any time you have to work around limits imposed by architecture/technology/coding decisions, you&#x27;re making an interest payment. Worse yet, side-stepping like the author describes is often like paying off one credit card with another - the premium compounds which dials up the interest payments. All of these sorts of things distract from delivering value and serve to further increase scheduling risk.<p>Point being, the author is correct that the case of having to make a large pay-off in order to move forward is quite rare. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you should disregard good project planning and discipline. As you point out, there are cases when you should take technical debt deliberately as part of some tactical decision such as when you are just getting an MVP together, or when you need to deliver immediately in order to make payroll. However every project accrues technical debt which was not deliberate as well.<p>Regardless of the cause, you&#x27;ll find that just like real loans, payments against the principle amortize best when they&#x27;re made early. That said, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay off a loan when doing so might cause you to miss out on some bigger opportunity, like a huge sale, or perhaps simply not starving.",1429511599

American prisons hold more people - by any measure - than any other society. (America is 5% of the world population but has 25% of the world&#x27;s prisoners.) Many of those people are serving very long sentences for drug offences. More than half of federal prisoners are there for drug crime, only about 16% of state prisoners are there for drug crime. As of 2001 one in six black American men had been incarcerated! Here&#x27;s an article talking about the very long (and racistly applied) prison sentencing for minor drug related crime: <a href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/opinion/high-time-the-injustice-of-marijuana-arrests.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/opinion/high-time-the-i...</a><p>> In October 2010, Bernard Noble, a 45-year-old trucker and father of seven with two previous nonviolent offenses, was stopped on a New Orleans street with a small amount of marijuana in his pocket. His sentence: more than 13 years.<p>> At least he will be released. Jeff Mizanskey, a Missouri man, was arrested in December 1993, for participating (unknowingly, he said) in the purchase of a five-pound brick of marijuana. Because he had two prior nonviolent marijuana convictions, he was sentenced to life without parole.<p>That&#x27;s <i>life</i> for a cannabis related crime.  I don&#x27;t understand how you think drug dealers in the US get light sentences?  &quot;African Americans serve virtually as much time in prison for a drug offense (58.7 months) as whites do for a violent offense (61.7 months). (Sentencing Project)&quot; (from link below)<p>And so far the only justification you&#x27;ve given for even longer sentences is that it&#x27;d make you feel good.<p>You started this thread by saying that you didn&#x27;t want to see drugs legalised. So criminal sellers only exist because you have laws against selling the drug.  This is obviously going to select for a certain type of person.  Removing those people from the chain of supply is one of the reasons to legalise! Why would I visit a scumbag criminal to buy contaminated heroin when I can get a clean product of known strength from a pharmacy?<p>Society has limited funds to deal with the problems that drugs cause.

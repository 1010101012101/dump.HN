8661152,comment,8659564,8660170,0,0,danjayh,,,"Agreed.  Although LEDs are far more efficient than incandescent bulbs, they still produce a non-trivial amount of heat.  Almost all useful LEDs have some form of heat sink (for a flashlight, it can be a substantial block of aluminum, for a through-hole LED, it is the leads).  Without some sort of a solid, heat-distributing backing, I cannot figure out what they would do with the heat produced by these.<p>As an example, I have a big-ass LED flashlight (google trustfire tr-j20).

For reference, source code is here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/Reedbeta/893b63390160e33ddb3c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/Reedbeta/893b63390160e33ddb3c</a>.<p>> without understanding basic signal processing.<p>I got the impression he approached it from visual pleasantness point of view. Which is more than perfectly valid when generating images <i>for people to look at</i>. In that business, if it&#x27;s fast to compute and looks visually good to human eyes, it is <i>perfectly acceptable</i> to do a slightly &quot;wrong&quot; thing from signal processing point of view. At least until we have infinite computing resources.<p>I didn&#x27;t read the source code, but judging by the article and images, he did appear to understand signal processing and sampling theorem. He appeared to look for a better sampler for a scan-line (think Pixar Renderman) or ray-tracer renderer (think POV-Ray).<p>My take is to have per pixel adaptive sample count as a function of standard deviation in certain sample radius larger than a pixel. Oversimplified, the higher the deviation, the more samples should be taken until the contribution is below some adjustable threshold. For example in a real ray-tracer you probably want to consider other variables as well, such as computational cost per sample. Ultimately the problem in visual renderers is how to get the best visual quality for computing resources available.<p>> Looks like he made the classic log/linear error too.<p>I can&#x27;t see any telltale sign of doing linear processing for log space data in the images themselves. They all look correct. Retina / high-dpi display? Make sure your web browser is not resampling the images linearly in log space!

8661083,comment,8650520,8658817,0,0,KittenLanguage,,,"Thanks for your input. I disagree with a lot of Hacker News on syntax though. Syntax can be learned and is not a hurdle for anyone who is seriously into programming, but I believe it keeps people away from programming who would be interested otherwise. I also think that readability is more important than writeability since maintenance is so important with any big project, and syntax is a piece of readability (though only a piece).<p>I agree other things beyond syntax are more important though, but I think I have enough interesting pieces of ideas that I want to put them all together and see what the big picture looks like. Perhaps it will stay a toy language, or perhaps it will grow beyond it. Some of those ideas I haven&#x27;t written down here either. One in particular that gives it hope for evolving beyond a toy language is a way to write small wrappers around C code to link it into Kitten code, so with a small amount of effort all of the impressive Microsoft libraries should be accessible for Windows computers at least.<p>I&#x27;ll have to check out Scala, I don&#x27;t know much about it. Also a couple languages I am really interested in right now are Nim and Crystal, a lot of my ideas share a lot with those two newer languages, a more static-y compile to C language than most newer languages.",1416975213

He obviously understands isolation well, so I would tend to believe him, but it would be nice to see an example.<p>In a simple case (not sure that it matches the exchange&#x27;s case), postgresql in any configuration will prevent this problem:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE account(\n      id int8,\n      balance numeric, check (balance >= 0)\n    );\n</code></pre>\nNo matter what concurrent activity you have going on, it&#x27;s impossible (as far as I know) to end up seeing a balance less than 0.

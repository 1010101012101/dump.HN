8593121,comment,8592189,8592740,0,0,brongondwana,,,"Exactly.  This fuzzy thinking in security is really frustrating me with the supposed security experts talking in this space.  I was at Inbox Love a couple of weeks ago, listening to Ladar Levison talking about security, and he gave an example which conflated encryption with digital signatures, saying that the lack of encryption in his incoming email would allow people to send him executables which were unknown viruses.<p>I actually raised my hand and said &quot;surely digital signatures confirming the sender are really what&#x27;s needed&quot; and he replied that if it was encrypted, the MITM wouldn&#x27;t know what was being sent to modify it.  For real.  As if the attacker can&#x27;t just replace the whole email with something else encrypted to your public key and containing a virus.<p>I lost a lot of respect for his security credentials in that moment, and I&#x27;ve lost a lot of respect for the EFF reading this posting.  Not a _single_ mention of password theft, which is by far the highest risk to most users of having STARTTLS stripped.  The ability for their email to be read over the backbone is bad, but the ability for hackers to get into their email and randomly delete or modify it is far more insidious.<p>(plus the ability to use the email account to trigger password resets on third party services and all sorts of other exciting stuff you can do once you own somebody&#x27;s email account)",1415750376

8593118,comment,8585483,8591312,0,0,latch,,,"ok, ok. I think I&#x27;m understanding. Let me propose a middle ground.<p>First, you really have to split this up into two distinct cases.<p>The most powerful/useful is when you create an interface in your package for a structure in a different package. It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve done .NET or Java, but I remember frequently cursing a library developer (often someone at Microsoft or Sun) for exposing a concrete type instead of an interface. In this case, I don&#x27;t see any downside. Creating a:<p>type Render interface {
  Draw()
}<p>And then using my (or someone else&#x27;s) Gun structure, is no different than using the Gun structure directly and expecting it to render itself to the screen rather than come out of its holster. The interface buys you the level of indirection, but whether you use the interface or the concrete type, it&#x27;s up to you to know WTF Draw() does.<p>This first approach is well explained at [1]<p>In the second case, where a library expects an interface, I agree there&#x27;s a risk:<p>// 3rd party package
package fastRender<p>type Drawable interface {
   Draw()
}<p>func Render(d Drawable) {
 ...
}<p>// my code:
fastRender.Render(new(Gun))<p>I&#x27;ve lost some degree or type checking. Since my Gun&#x27;s Draw doesn&#x27;t explicitly implement fastRender.Drawable, maybe I&#x27;m trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. There&#x27;s nothing the compiler can do to help either.<p>It sounds a bit like an academic concern to me. Is this something that&#x27;s actually bitten people in the ass? How is it different than any method that takes primitives? I can pass a []byte of a bitmap to a Music player&#x27;s Play(data []byte) method...<p>[1] <a href=""https://medium.com/@rakyll/interface-pollution-in-go-7d58bccec275"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@rakyll/interface-pollution-in-go-7d58bcc...</a>",1415750313

Then the whole floor died, suddenly.<p>Of the seven or so bars, they all went under within a few years of 2000 and the whole floor has been more or less completely dead for almost a decade now.

In that case I&#x27;d say expressive languages help, but only indirectly, because they make it possible to keep track of effects and interactions without having to write reams of code.<p>In a language with lenses, you can delimit where your models are mutated. In a language that lets you treat composable effects in a generic way, you can e.g. split up your variables explicitly with ReaderWriterState, making it clearer which serves which purpose.<p>The kind of things you might be tempted to use &quot;magic&quot; or global variables for in a lesser language - the &quot;cross-cutting concerns&quot; - you can instead handle in normal code as a generic kind of context. E.g. an audit trail can just be Writer. Or actions that need access to a database session can just be another kind of context. I&#x27;m working on such a thing right now (see tpolecat&#x27;s doobie for a public example of the same kind of thing) - whether a function accesses the database or not is visible right in its type, but it&#x27;s easy to compose functions that do. The types ripple up, and in the end I&#x27;m probably going to do session-creation-in-view - but in a principled way, using the ordinary type system, visible in the code - with Spray, my web route definitions are just another ordinary bit of Scala code (whereas in most languages I would define routes in an external config file, or at best a config object a la Django - adding complexity).<p>Heck, error handling is a perfectly good example of this. In a less expressive language, the only way around the boilerplate of handling errors where they occur is unchecked exceptions (or effectively-unchecked exceptions, as in &quot;throws Exception&quot;). In a language with good generic context support, the possibility of failure is just another kind of context that we compose with the same generic tools as any other, and the control flow becomes something sensible again.",1415747917

I look forward to meeting you.&quot;<p>I, too, look forward to meeting you!  But that probably won&#x27;t happen.  Good luck with your experiment, though.<p>Also, a few things to remember:  You&#x27;re much more valuable than your first employers would have you believe.  Don&#x27;t let that go to your head.  Do go to university.  I know how eager you are, having been in that position myself, but it&#x27;s a mistake to drop out of one of the most effective social networks ever devised by humankind.  Go for the social experience and the social doors it opens.  If you&#x27;re still not convinced, take a hard look at the background of all of the YC partners and realize that all of them seem to have attended some good schools.  While you can make it without university, and you can lead a happy life and do whatever you want and be in the upper 1% of quality of life across all of humanity without attending university, you only get one chance to choose not to follow &quot;The Path,&quot; which is high school -> good university (undergrad) -> better university (graduate student) -> learn how to be around rich people and  convince them of your way of thinking.  Normal people who don&#x27;t attend university simply don&#x27;t get this opportunity.  Specifically, the opportunity to test out what works and what doesn&#x27;t, socially, with wealthy people.  Why is this important?  Well, if you want to do something big, and you don&#x27;t have any money, wealthy people are by definition the only ones who can help you.  Even at absurdly high salaries, it&#x27;s very hard to save up money to do something that involves hiring other people.  Possible, but difficult.  So where do you turn?  Investors, of course.  Except, crap, they&#x27;re wealthy, and you have no idea how to be around them as equals.  But wait, you attended university, and so maybe they have some shared ground with you...  Hm, nope, you didn&#x27;t.  Well, of course, your website demonstrates traction, and traction is what matters to an investor.  But what else do investors care about?  Your team.  Where (or whether) you went to university says a lot about you, fortunately or unfortunately.<p>Really, there&#x27;s no reason not to go.  Make some reasonably intelligent decisions and you&#x27;ll have a great time while getting the debt paid off in a reasonable timeframe.<p>But if you don&#x27;t go, you may find you&#x27;ll want to later but never really get the opportunity.  Not in the way you once had.  Once you depart from The Path, you&#x27;ll have to beat your way back onto it, surmounting bills and work and all kinds of annoying stuff that people fresh out of highschool don&#x27;t really have to worry about just yet.<p>Speaking of bills and debt: whatever you do, don&#x27;t get into credit card debt.  Don&#x27;t get into credit card debt!  I can&#x27;t emphasize this enough.  It&#x27;s so tempting, but just don&#x27;t.<p>Do use a credit card though.  Just pay it off every month.  Otherwise you may not be able to get services (internet, phone, whatever) at a new apartment, or buy a car.  Had it happen to me once, and it sucks.  No credit history = unknown risk = &quot;I&#x27;m sorry but we will never do business with you.&quot;<p>Kind of an awkward place to end a ramble, but whatever.  Maybe some of the ideas might be useful.<p>Maybe consider leveraging this particular experiment to help you attend one of the local top-tier universities as an undergrad.  Ask people if they have any advice on this, and maybe you&#x27;ll find someone who could help with the admissions process.  Who you know matters more than what your highschool history was like, so maybe some strings could be pulled somewhere.",1415747145

i.e. get the character to compare mod the length, so you wrap around if the length of the two strings is not the same.<p>Unfortunately the mod operator does not take a constant time on a CPU! If the result is evenly divisible it&#x27;s faster.<p>So even in assembly you might not be able to protect from a timing attack. Even if you check your current CPU a new one might be different.<p>(In this case a better way to do the compare is if the strings are not the same length, compare the attackers string against itself, and then return false.)",1415747118

8526105,comment,8522471,8523576,0,0,sbking,,,"The reasons I prefer Meteor (in no particular order):<p>* Fully automated build chain. No matter what kind of preprocessors I use, all my code is compiled, bundled, and hot reloaded into the application. CSS updates are automatically live injected into running applications without a browser refresh. I don&#x27;t have to write any build chain code, just application code.<p>* Isomorphic client/server APIs, with code sharing built into the build chain. I&#x27;m using the same language with the same APIs in both environments, drastically decreasing redundant code. Clients can simulate server RPCs using the same function  as the server while it waits for the server&#x27;s response. If I want, I can easily make the client&#x27;s simulation code different from the server&#x27;s such as when I want to obfuscate something, or simply disable client simulation for certain RPCs. The package system incorporates both server and client assets, allowing drop-in full-stack components, such as...<p>* The Accounts UI component. A drop-in, automated SRP+OAuth authentication system that&#x27;s easy to customize and restyle, or build from scratch using the simple JS authentication APIs. It takes minutes to make a web application with a fully-featured and secure authentication system with password-based and 3rd party OAuth login methods. And logging in never requires a refresh.<p>* Already glued together. Endpoints don&#x27;t have to be hooked up; they&#x27;re hooked up from default. Publish data on the server. Subscribe on the client. Add authorization rules, and I have a fully functional web application with realtime data updates, with virtually no glue code.",1414572016

Even with hobby robotics there&#x27;s a maximum failure cost you can stomach, there&#x27;s only so many servos you can burn through, and you only have finite time to program, which limits the number of attempts you can make.<p>One great way to lower the amount of expesive failures is to hedge it with a number of cheaper failures, whether that&#x27;d be models, prototypes or testing rigs for individual components of an airplane or rocket. If you look at the early stages of avionics, there were many failures, some of them expensive, deadly or embarrasing. But over time, we did build up a repertoire of testing methods to verify a given airplane design. Does that mean our airplanes don&#x27;t fail? No. Does that mean we aren&#x27;t trying to develop even better airplanes because of the risk involved? No. But all in all, it&#x27;s a considerable improvement.

GSAP is not meant to be a monolithic, opinionated framework in which you build your entire app/site like famo.us. You can build the way YOU want, and then leverage GSAP to animate pretty much <i></i>anything<i></i> JavaScript can touch; CSS properties of DOM elements, canvas library objects, generic objects, SVG, whatever. It&#x27;s insanely flexible. It solves a bunch of browser bugs and inconsistencies too.<p>With GSAP, you don&#x27;t have to keep switching animation tools based on your project. It doesn&#x27;t try to own the rendering layer like famo.us does. It just makes animating a lot faster, more fun and less tedious.<p>That&#x27;s not to say famo.us is &quot;bad&quot; at all - some people prefer their approach and it has its strengths for certain types of projects (I think they&#x27;re going mostly after mobile app development).<p>Yes, GSAP has physics plugins (see the docs). Check out the fluid motion of Draggable which (unlike jQuery UI&#x27;s Draggable) works inside transformed elements and honors momentum and complex snapping rules. <a href=""http://greensock.com/draggable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greensock.com/draggable/</a><p>For some preliminary thoughts about famo.us and GSAP, see

If a client hires you to do a custom project (web site, banner ad, whatever), no special license is needed no matter how much you get paid. The only time you need the license is if you&#x27;re reselling your product to <i>MULTIPLE</i> customers. That&#x27;s it. Everything else is free. With this model, a small group of power users who make $ off of GSAP provide a funding mechanism to make it accessible to everyone else and allow GreenSock to provide solid support and continued innovation. Check out the GreenSock forums to see how well-supported it is (and has been for years).<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to give the famo.us, Velocity.js, and GSAP a try and see which feels best to you.

8526071,comment,8522247,8524286,0,0,acqq,,,"The basic idea of public key is to be visible to everybody. I consider the real problem to be &quot;spamming.&quot; If you have some site which stores the keys and it has a thousand of different public keys claiming to be from, e.g. &quot;Laura Poitras&quot; you don&#x27;t know which one is the real one. So the selection of the &quot;real&quot; key between of all of possible keys is something that should be verified independently. Even if you have only one key, you must verify that really that key  belongs to the person you want to reach.<p>Snowden solved it by requesting the public tweet of Lauras&#x27;s key fingerprint which was enough. Having the match of the fingerprint is enough. It&#x27;s much smaller than the whole key. For example, if Laura&#x27;s key is 4096 bits to print it you&#x27;d need around 700 letters. But to verify some 4096 bits you have to actually be Laura&#x27;s key, it&#x27;s enough that the fingerprint of, for example, 160 bits match: the math magic involved in creating the fingerprint should guarantee you that nobody can create another key and have the same fingerprint.<p>In the article, the fingerprint used 4 bits per letter, and there were 40 letters, so it was just 160 bits that Snowden used to verify the key.",1414570919

JSX basically solves a problem that JSX created. The reason people like JSX is that it takes the unchanging DOM structure (basically the virtual DOM equivalent of HTML templating) and puts it in HTML like templates do. This gives it a sufficiently different syntax, that it&#x27;s easy to visually discern the changing parts from the unchanging parts, especially with syntax highlighting support. However, with createFactory, you have a way to wrap up all the unchanging structure, such that you don&#x27;t have to constantly have to mentally parse the unchanging structure from the virtual DOM that render() is actually going to update. This means you still have to deal with React.DOM, but if you use react-hyperscript, the syntax is sufficiently simplified that it&#x27;s comparable to HTML.<p>The complexity of JSX simply isn&#x27;t worth it. It breaks too many tools.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mlmorg/react-hyperscript</a>",1414570911

The concept of a latent type applies to arbitrary expressions, not just variables. All the values flowing through a PHP program implicitly share the same union type; they can be floats, strings, arrays, etc. The latent types are the narrower types that can actually flow through the program in practice.<p>To be clear, it is more general than just things like:<p><pre><code>  $a = 0; // $a is an int!
</code></pre>
It includes learning that:<p><pre><code>  g(foo() . bar());
</code></pre>
foo() and bar() return strings. Since none of this information is marked syntactically in PHP, and since it might actually be undecidable because of dynamic control flow in the callees, dynamic binding, etc., you really need to see the program run to do this stuff.",1414570544

Especially after I was in a situation where I was a caregiver for a sick loved one for some years.  Even after that spell of time, I lost weight fairly quickly (and healthily) by mountain biking.  I&#x27;ve lost weight by exercising via having fun on a mountain bike, hiking, climbing, kayaking, surfing, etc. and eating less (and somewhat healthier) and drinking more water.<p>I guess I just don&#x27;t see how a fitness app would have improved my situation.  Again, I&#x27;m not dissing on those that use them, but I personally don&#x27;t get it.<p>I&#x27;m still curious after your response. How would a fitness app and device helped me?<p>>Lots of people don&#x27;t enjoy exercise, especially people trying to establish a pattern with it that haven&#x27;t done so yet.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because they set it up like a chore with a computing device instead of doing it for fun and health as a side benefit?<p>I&#x27;m only half-kidding about that...<p>I personally can&#x27;t stand sitting inside and getting exercise on some rat wheel in a gym.  If it&#x27;s hot, I bring lots of water and dress appropriately for the weather.  If it&#x27;s cold, I bundle up.  I enjoy the challenge that the elements bring to the table outdoors.  I also like using my brain trying to navigate trails, etc. instead of doing repetitious, boring (to me) brain-dead indoor exercise machines like treadmills, etc.<p>I dunno, maybe if people worried less about their fitness tracking devices, trying to treat exercise like work and instead just have more fun, they&#x27;d be more apt to exercise?<p>I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy exercise either if I treated it like work.<p>>I think you are presenting a false dichotomy.<p>Perhaps I am for others.  For me personally, I just don&#x27;t see the enjoyment of meticulously tracking my heart rate, etc. while I&#x27;m flying down some trails, hiking my bike up rocks, etc.  I know my heart is working because it&#x27;s pounding with joy (and sometimes fear) and that&#x27;s enough for me.  Or, if someone spots a bear I sure as heck don&#x27;t need a fitness app to let me know my heart is ticking. ;)<p>Again, I know what works for me certainly doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but as hard as I try, I just don&#x27;t get the fitness apps and devices being very conducive to enjoyable exercise.  Just seems like another distraction from getting busy and having fun in the process.<p>The only device I like to bring is a little shuffle for music and I often turn that off so I can hear the sounds of nature while I&#x27;m out there.  A fancy pants fitness device that alerts me that my heart rate has reached some kind of &quot;optimum&quot; zone or whatever just seems like a mechanical killjoy to an otherwise organic, almost tribal/ animalistic/sensual experience getting down and dirty with nature.<p>Again, this is just me.  If other find enjoyment in fitness apps and devices that run them, then more power to them! :D<p>Who knows, maybe someone can make a good enough argument for me to start using them someday if/when I have health issues, etc. down the road.",1414569837

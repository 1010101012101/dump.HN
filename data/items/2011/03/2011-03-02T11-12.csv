Im personally involved with 2 projects that are being directed at kids and teens and are using game mechanics to try to get them excited about learning.<p>There is a DESPARATE need within this market for passionate knowledgeable and skilled people who are willing to invest their time energy and certainly money to help build these projects and get the word out.  Personally knowing that the work that im doing will help kids and teens and maybe even young adults get excited about learning is more exciting then the idea of having everybody use my product and then being able to sell it and make alot of money.  Ok almost as exciting.  :-).<p>So please consider it.  Thank you.",1299067195

That might be a product or service.<p>And these things can be exchanged for money, which can then be given to other people in exchange for their labor.<p>Yes, technically you are borrowing money, but it has no effect until its used to purchase the results of labor, which is what you actually want to borrow.  Your mortgage is actually borrowing the results of all of the labor required to build it, including the labor to make the sheet rock.<p>If there's a disaster in Haiti and the US lends Haiti a billion dollars, that money will be used to buy things.  Or pay people to do things, who will then go and buy things with the money.<p>Demand then rises for these things and more of them must be imported.  Even if they come from a third country, that additional demand causes imports to increase there.  Ultimately, that additional demand affects exports from the US.<p>And, if Haiti ever pays the money back, Haiti will be the one experiencing an increase in its exports.<p>The beauty is that we are not locked into buying just the products and services the lender offers.  We can get anybody's.<p>To learn more about this, you could check out Austrian economics and the division of labor.",1299067169

I note that I cannot recall anyone at Apple saying this.<p>According to Fortune, either Cook, Oppenheimer or Cue said this <i>""Capitalizing on the ""explosive"" demand for the iPad, believing that tablets could end up being a bigger market than PCs. (If this is so, Sacconaghi calculates that the iPad could eventually be a $60 billion to $100 billion business for Apple.)""</i><p>That doesn't mean that PCs will go away, at $500 for the average (future!) price of a PC that still leaves room for 100 million PCs to be sold each year, which is still a lot of PCs.  It also doesn't say at what point in the distant future this might occur.<p>On the other hand, if it is some breathless pundit speculating hard (as they are wont to do) who claims that the iPad is a future computer replacement, I take it with exactly the same seriousness as I do all their other breathless pronouncements about the 101 iPod/iPad/iPhone killers that are announced each week, which is to say I don't take it seriously at all.<p>None of the tech pundits can predict the future worth a damn.  They've proved this time and time again.  Gruber has a running joke with claim-chowder (a play on words for clam chowder), where he takes the stupid things people said in the past and calls them to task for it.",1299066927

Income, twenty shillings a week, expenditure, nineteen shillings and sixpence; result, happiness.""</i><p>However if Apple cut back to say 25% then it might mean that they are subsidising people's use of the store.  This would be bad for Apple because they would be losing money.  Boo hoo.  On the other hand, if they were losing money with one hand in order to (as you suggest) gain it with the other, then they would open themselves to questions of dumping, price fixing, abuse of monopoly etc.<p>Selling at below cost is a typical strategy to keep new entrants out of the market, and so would be evil.

The amount of real value in internet business is huge today, and the industry is more mature. Web companies take in hundreds of billions of dollars a year in revenue and the longest lived have been profitable for a decade or more. Meanwhile, though valuations are occasionally high the craziness from the first dot-com bubble has been much tempered. Investors aren't dumping millions into niche companies with no revenues, no history, and no business plan, they might be making risky bets from time to time but the risk is much reduced from the wild west era. Overall these factors add up to bubble protection measures. It's simply much harder for a true speculative dot-com bubble to build up and to burst.<p>Instead we'll likely see dot-com companies meld into the same pattern as traditional companies, as sane investing takes hold and subject matter expertise becomes more common. Every industry, no matter how old, goes through periods of boom and bust, but generally the amplitude of these fluctuations is small enough for the economy to handle it.",1299065365

Whenever I see that happen, regardless of the topic,  I know which side of that divide I want to be on.<p>-----<p>True story: today I went down to the local $non_profit and helped out one of the guys get his new Apple laptop hooked up to the network and the network printer.  The network worked immediately after entering the WEP password.  The printer didn't work first time, so I deleted it and tried with new settings.  It worked the second time.  I also tried to persuade him of the virtues of buying a 1-2TB drive and using Time Machine.<p>It was so easy it was embarrassing.<p>I contrast that with some work I did with a startup last year.  I bought one of their own Windows laptops into their HQ, and trying to get onto their own wireless network was a nightmare, even though I had a room full of techies to help.

At the end I fully commended him (he's running anti-virus, anti-spam and does regular backups) for his efforts, and I assured him that he was doing the right thing with the backups, to keep doing exactly what he is doing.  I didn't preach to him about Apple at all, I don't see the need.  If he's happy, let him be happy.  If he is doing everything right but has some nagging feeling that he should be doing something else, I will reassure him that he's miles ahead of the rest of the pack.",1299064972

For example, there is a very respected Programming Course in the Israeli army, which trains programmers for half a year. These programmers then go on to work on all the Armies' systems for the next 5 1/2 years. This course is called Mamram (I was in it).<p>This means that programmers in Israel are not only trained in a very intensive course for half a year, but they then go on to work on real-world (and often critical) systems, for 5 1/2 years. Which means there are many Israeli programmers who, at age 24, have 6 years of professional experience working on big, important systems.<p>Add to this that the Mamram course is very famous (most Israeli companies require programmers to <i>either</i> have a degree <i>or</i> be a graduate of Mamra). Also, serving 6 years in the army (and being in a course with 100 peers) means you get an incredible network of connections. I'm a good example - I'm working on my own startup with two people I served with in the army, and I know many people who either work at or run a lot of Israeli startups, just because I served with them at some point. I'm probably 2 hops from most startups in Israel, just because almost all of them hire programmers from the Mamram course.<p>OK that came out long. I only focused on the Mamram course since that's what I know best, but there are a lot of other fields the army is great for that have nothing to do with programming.",1299064141

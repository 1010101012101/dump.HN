Make it clear you want work as a technical contributor who writes lots of code (they will like this).  You&#x27;ll still make $150k and have equity in place of the extra bonus cash.  But, if you like the team and believe in what the company wants to do, and you write code every day to help push the company there, you&#x27;ll probably be a lot happier.",1408170371

Iirc the reason Coverity couldn&#x27;t catch Heartbleed was because the OpenSSL people insisted on rolling their own inferior memory allocation. It would have worked if they just used the system malloc(). Coverity only works for normal programmers, it can&#x27;t fully mitigate the ingenuity of complete fools.<p>Of course, my recollection could be wrong.

There isn&#x27;t really a book that offers as easy an intro to iterative algorithms as Trefthen does for direct ones. In this case I would recommend to fall back on trusty old Golub and Van Loan (recently released in a new edition).",1408170225

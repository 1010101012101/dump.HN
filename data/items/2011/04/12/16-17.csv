2438040,comment,2437071,2437682,1,0,ohyes,,,"""People find it easier to grasp an instance of a pattern or abstraction they already know, than to grasp a new abstraction altogether.""<p>But the idea is to build the program up until you are working in a set of target abstractions that fit well with the problem domain. If I don't know the problem domain (or have materials to help me understand it), I have no business writing a program for it.<p>You are always looking for a high level of cohesion and a low level of coupling. If you already have a natural language that experts talk about the problem in, it is likely that the set of terminology derived from it has these properties. (It is well specified, it is precise, work has been done in it). A trivial example might be the difference between doing statistical work in C vs. statistical work in R. R is pretty clearly better for it.<p>Modifying something that has a lot of dependencies is only hazardous if what that particular something does is underspecified. If it is a bug in one use of that operator, it should be a bug in every use of that operator. If it isn't, perhaps the operator has special cases, or perhaps you really want two different operators (in either case, it needs greater specification).<p>YMMV, but in my opinion, one should not be modifying a program that one does not understand (at least mostly). It is easier to modify the 'non bottom up' program without understanding the whole, because generally, you do not have a chance at understanding the whole (not really 'whole', more like 'significant chunk'). You have no other option but to try something and see if it works. It also seems that you would frequently 'miss' changes that need to be propagated throughout the code-base (things that are actually bugs in other places, but perhaps are not manifesting).",1302627588

Maneker wonders.</i><p>What makes Harvard Harvard is that <i>not</i> anyone can go there.  If everyone could, it would just be a good state school, and that certainly wouldn't pay the bills.<p>What universities don't realize, is that the same force which drove more and more people to attend college at the beginning of the information age, is also tearing down the requirement for college.  There is really very little that you can't learn or even experience on your own these days to give yourself a brilliant education.<p>That said, a good college is still far and away the best way to learn classical knowledge quickly.  I am very thankful for my CS degree, because there's no way I would have gotten that breadth of exposure to the most interesting parts of CS with 4 years in industry, but with the way tuition is increasing, the cost is squeezing out the benefit for more and more people, masked only by the availability of government loans, and throwing people into a life of indentured servitude.<p>I don't know if Thiel is doing these kids a favor, but it's certainly no worse than the deal they'll get from the establishment.

2437990,comment,2437071,2437567,2,0,rickmode,,,"Here's yet another stab at explaining closures using C. Hopefully this is clear.<p>The confusion about closures happens because it doesn't exist in other languages. (There isn't a way to express it.)<p>Let's look at a simple C function that uses a global variable:<p><pre><code>  int a = 1;\n\n  int a_plus_2() {\n    return 2 + a;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis always returns 2 more than ""a"". Initially it will return 3. If ""a"" is set to 5 at some point in the future, ""a_plus_2"" will then return 7. Simple. No closure here.<p>In Lisp, ""a"" would be called a ""dynamic variable"" because it changing its value affects all code that uses ""a"" over time, including usage within other scopes; ""a"" has a dynamic binding. But Lisp also has static binding which means the value of the variable is captured each time a scope is created and remains static over time within that scope.<p>Imagine a variation of C where variable make this distinction explicit by prefixing with with <dynamic> and <static>. <dynamic> would be the default and in fact is how the real C behaves. <static> now means Lisp notion of static binding (forget C's notion of static, which is totally different). Let's use it.<p><pre><code>  <static> int b = 1;\n  \n  int b_plus_2() {\n    return 2 + b;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo here ""b"" is marked as static. When ""b_plus_2"" is defined at compile time, the current value of ""b"" is captured - statically bound - to its current value of 1. So ""b_plus_2"" will always return 3 _even if the global variable ""b"" is later modified.<p><pre><code>  b = 5; /* modifying b */\n  \n  int new_b_plus_2 {\n    return 2 + b;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nCalling ""new_b_plus_2"" return 7. No surprise here. The twist is that the original ""b_plus_2"" still returns 3. The value of ""b"" is captured in a closure. Each new scope encloses the current value of ""b"", binding its current value statically (unchanging) within that scope. Closures become interesting when the block in question is a function body.<p>So, yeah - it's a simple concept in the end. It's tricky because it doesn't exist many other languages. It provides a way to encapsulate state analogous to an object in OO languages [1].<p>The concept is more useful in Lisp with its higher order functions - functions that define other functions. This is very fluid in Lisp, while Python uses its lambda form for anonymous functions, Ruby has blocks and lambdas and...[2], and Java gets close with inner classes.<p>I hope this helps.<p>[1] ""Objects are a poor man's closure"" and ""Closures are a poor man's object"" <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497801/closures-are-poor-mans-objects-and-vice-versa-what-does-this-mean"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497801/closures-are-poor...</a><p>[2] I'm don't do Ruby - but's here's a ton of stuff on closures in Ruby: <a href=""http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://innig.net/software/ruby/closures-in-ruby.rb</a>",1302627138

2437940,comment,2437071,2437567,4,0,rayiner,,,"So say I have a first-order language (where functions are not values). You can write:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x): return x + 1\n</code></pre>\nBut not:<p><pre><code>    def bar(baz, x): return baz(x+1)\n</code></pre>\nThat is to say, you pass integers around ('x' above) as values, but not functions. In a minimal higher order language, like C, you can pass functions around like values. Ie: baz could be a pointer to a function in the second line above, which is called by bar.<p>Now, what happens when you have nested functions?<p><pre><code>    def foo():\n        def bar(y):\n            return y + 1\n        return bar\n</code></pre>\nYou can't do this in C, but conceptually that's not much different than just defining foo and bar as two separate top-level functions.<p>But what happens when the inner function refers to a local variable of the outer function?<p><pre><code>    def foo():\n        x = 1\n        def bar(y):\n            return x + 1\n        return bar\n</code></pre>\nHow does 'bar' know what 'x' is? You might ask, why would you want to do this? Well, say you have a function map(fun, list). Map takes a function and a list. It returns a list, each element of which is the value yielded by calling fun with an element in list. Eg:<p><pre><code>    def foo(x): return x + 1\n    map(foo, [1, 2, 3]) # -> [2, 3, 4]\n</code></pre>\nMap can be defined as:<p><pre><code>    def map(fun, list):\n        result = []\n        foreach item in list:\n            result.append(fun(item))\n</code></pre>\nSo back to the example, you might want to write something like:<p><pre><code>    def foo(list):\n        x = some_calculation()\n        def bar(y): return x + y\n        return map(bar, list)\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, the function that you pass to map needs to know not just the current element of the list, but some other information that is held in a local variable in the parent function. This case is very common when using map as replacement for ""for"" loops (note how in a loop you can refer to the local variables of your function inside the body of the loop).<p>Now technically the name of the language feature that lets you capture the value of local variables in child functions is ""lexically scoped lambda"" or something along those lines. A closure is just the most common way to implement the language feature, but people often just use ""closure"" to refer to the language feature itself.<p>In a compiler that uses closures, the example above would be translated into code something like:<p><pre><code>    class _closure_bar: \n        this.x = Nil\n\n       def _closure_bar(x):\n           this.x = x           \n\n       def operator() (y):\n           return this.x + y\n\n    def foo(list):\n        x = some_calculation()\n        bar = new _closure_bar(x)\n        return map(bar, list)\n    </code></pre>\nInstead of passing around a function as a function pointer like in C, you pass around a callable object whose members are the local variables of the parent function captured by the inner function, and which when called executes the body of the inner function.<p>Now, there is some additional complexity which occurs when an inner function modified the value of a local variable of an outer function. Languages like Python just disallow such modification, which is why people complain about Python not having ""full lambdas"". Languages like Common Lisp and Scheme add another indirection for local variables that are captured + assigned-to in an inner function.",1302626395

Im not expecting anyone to be a Guru, just with some varied web app development experience, motivated, committed and excited at the prospects of implementing my webapp idea.<p>Problem statement: \nAt present, web is ruled by Social Networking which is on Rage everywhere. I am developing a personal web-app (as personal as email) which is complete  opposite of this and I feel this will also soon catchup as people have to live with both - Personal and social. App is more related with personal tracking and improvement. ""This webapp is an Event Recording mechanism which stores events that are happening in Ones life. user has to log those events. Events can be good or bad that happen to every one."" More about the app once you evince interest and mail me. Obviously I am holding the many punch-lines till the formation of team.<p>Though my webapp is intended as visually rich personal logger, it also targets social networking by sharing ones personal event logs. So, it is going to be a disruptive app.  I am completely confident about this app. This web-app has a WOW factor in it and is definitely going to be successful, if it has right mix of founding hackers with right attitude. Everyone partnering in this project, will have a win-win situation(EQUITY) as I see good monetizing power for this webapp. I don't want someone with just experience, I want someone who has as much of a passion for the idea as I have.I would like to hear any feedback about this idea.<p>I am also aspiring for winter YC2011 or atleast Summer YC2012.If you are interested, please mail me with your phone number and other details. I will personally call you and we will work out a deal. I know you hackers are already busy with your own ideas. I need some one who wants to take up more challenges and be committed till we taste success.  I feel with 2 or 3 sound hackers, this webapp can be realized in 4 to 5 months. If you have friends looking to do a startup please pass this along.<p>Thanks alot for your time. \nMy Email: techeye101 [at] gmail [dot] com",1302625510

You can do something similar with a custom JQuery or YUI build, but not nearly to the same level, and with the same granularity that the closure compiler does automatically.<p>Unfortunately, to take full advantage of the compiler you must run with advanced optimizations turned on, which in turn means that your code has to be structured for use with the compiler. You're not going to take an existing codebase and just throw it into the compiler with advanced optimizations and have it work out for you.<p>But if you start a project with the closure library and the closure compiler, you can get some pretty amazing optimizations. We were seeing relatively full-featured apps at compiled, uncompressed sizes of under 10k. Full sites well under 100k with a lot of javascript is completely doable.<p>Couple that with the dynamically-loading module system and you've got a crazy fast front end.<p>To top it all off, the compiler respects and can warn about type mismatching if you annotate your code. It's a great way to both document and check your codebase.<p>The closure library and closure compiler are warty enough that I don't think they'll see widespread adoption the way that JQuery has, but the closure tools, or something like them, is definitely the way forward.",1302625299

How would you structure such a deal? If you were one of those managers what would you need to ask for? Clearly you need some working capital because you'll have material in inventory and in the pipeline. You need to retain the manufacturer contracts (or a modified contract if they are more generic) and you need some space to hold the team.<p>Seems like option #1 is quick, painful (you lay off 550 people in this example) and you have a lot off excess material to dump / dispose at a loss.<p>I tried to buy one of my patents back from Sun (they were never going to use it) and that was a complete waste of time. So I wonder how one evaluates the impact to the business of these choices. Anyone here been in that situation and chosen option 2 or 3 ? Did it work out? Not? Did you wish you had chosen option 1 ?",1302624998

I am a single 26-year-old male, I live a very lean lifestyle, and I can afford to place a bet on the most intriguing startup concept I have ever heard.""<p>- Opening paragraph of my cover letter to Zaarly<p>I had offered two months rent in my San Francisco studio apartment  a bet on my short-term performance and Zaarlys long-term potential. If I earned full-time employment, I would earn that money back within a few months and I would be joining one of the most promising startups in the world.<p>I submitted my ""pay-for-employment"" offer at 1:30 a.m. on March 21, and when I woke up, I had an interview offer in my inbox. I accepted a position on the Zaarly marketing team at 3:45 p.m. that same day, under the condition that I move from San Francisco to Kansas City, Mo. within 12 hours. I have never lived outside California or visited Kansas City, but I took the job. And Zaarly didnt even accept my money  they offered to pay me instead!<p>By the time I returned home, it was already 11:00 p.m. I reserved a taxi for 3:45 a.m. and packed my entire life into a 27-inch suitcase in just thirty minutes. My older brother, Matt, drank a beer with me and watched me throw clothes into a suitcase. I remember Matt asking why I needed to leave San Francisco for this startup. San Francisco literally has thousands of startups.<p>Zaarly was different from every other startup in the world, I explained. We would advance human behavior and create new communities based upon a simple question, ""What would you pay for right now?"" We would build an entirely new economy for services and goods.<p>I have been obsessed with peer-to-peer, collaborative consumption my entire life, so this was an easy pitch. I am one of eight children, and growing up we always negotiated for something inside my house. But I could tell Matt wasnt entirely convinced.<p>I played Zaarlys Startup Weekend LA pitch on YouTube, the most irreverent and inspiring startup moment that I have ever seen. Bo Fishback (CEO), Erik Koester (COO), and Ian Hunter (CTO) shared their vision for a new buyer-powered marketplace, and it felt more like a Judd Apatow movie than a sales pitch.<p>As the pitch ended, I smiled at Matt. He was sold.<p>I landed in Kansas City the next morning without a car or a hotel. I took a cab straight to Zaarly HQ, arriving with my suitcase and a computer. The only person at the office was Adam Coomes, who I had spoken to during my interview.<p>When I asked where I should put my suitcase, I knew Adam thought I was a little crazy, but thats why I landed the job. I left my suitcase in the front lobby and pulled out my laptop, ready to work.<p>In our first meeting, my co-workers and I spoke about our career paths and our reasons for joining Zaarly. I realized that my ""sacrifice"" to be here was not that special. Sure, I abandoned my Mission District apartment in 12 hours for a city I have never visited. But unlike many of my co-workers, I do not have a wife to love, a mortgage to pay or a dog to walk. Besides my supportive family, I have no physical attachments to any location  so this journey was easy to make.<p>I finally realized I was actually in Kansas City the morning after I moved into an apartment with Sara Davidson, who quit her PR career at Bailey Lauerman to join Zaarly. During our first morning at the apartment, I was shaving my beard before work.<p>Sara walked into the bathroom, paid no attention to me, and just started brushing her teeth. I stared at her in our bathroom mirror with half a beard on my face. I kept staring as she brushed her teeth and rinsed out her mouth.<p>""I didnt know we would be sharing the bathroom mirror every morning,"" I said with a smile.<p>""We are family now. Get over it,"" Sara said.<p>Thats when I realized  Zaarly really will change human behavior  it has already changed mine. I now share a bathroom mirror with a female co-worker before work.<p>I have a new family in a city full of strangers. Id pay for that.",1302624699

It does small things quickly, but have you noticed the number of complaints about how Node.js produces spaghetti code increasing lately, quietly and slowly but steadily? It's still buried under the hype, but expect it to get worse. And not ""get worse before it gets better"", just... get worse.<p>I laid it out more at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2370303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2370303</a> .<p>Javascript doesn't particularly bring any abstraction capabilities to the table that Perl (POE, Event::Lib, IO::Async), Python (Twisted), or Ruby (EventMachine) doesn't, and current Javascript is actually deficient in the abstraction department by comparison. (The latest ECMAscript spec can compare to them, so Javascript will get there. Something like Python generators allow you to string together a couple more tricks together before the complexity becomes a problem, and Javascript will eventually have this.) They all result in programs that end up the same way. There are some tricks you can play that improve the situation a bit over raw callbacks, like trying to sequence them, but composing these tricks together gets harder and harder the fancier you get.<p>None of those libraries really took off and some of them I know had way more effort poured into them than Node.js has seen yet, like Twisted. And it's because the style, combined with language runtimes that can't manage the scheduling for you while retaining the code context, has certain inevitable results. You can (and should!) delay the inevitable, but it's still inevitable.<p>At the <i>very least</i>, I would suggest that if you going to consider using Node.js you should be aware of the fact that it's not a blindingly new thing, it's a relatively well-explored space being translated into a new language, and you can get a good sense of the tradeoffs from the many previous explorations of this space. There are still places where it may be the right choice; as I said in that other message, I have chosen event-based coding in another context because it was still the right choice. But I knew the tradeoffs going in, and took steps to mitigate them, rather than being blindsided by them.",1302624142

This is from a slightly lower coal price ($1.50/MMBtu).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/epm_sum.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat5p3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat5p3.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epata6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epata6.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/coal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/coal/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/eJlUL.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/eJlUL.png</a>",1302624080

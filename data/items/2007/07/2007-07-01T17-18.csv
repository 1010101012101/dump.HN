I think the problem with simply blocking people and sites is that the site still ""tips"", and you end up ignoring too many people.  The happiest people are those who dont' have to ignore anyone.<p>Which brings up another point - do you really want to foster debate?  Maybe it's better to just feed people what they want.  If I can't have thoughtful, considerate, and informed debate, I think I'd rather just have the echo chamber than impolite, rude, paranoid extremist rants.

Many of us think of invention or innovation as a wholly conceived, brand-new, big-leap-forward creation unlike anything that has preceded it. But much of mechanical success involves fiddling with the inherent conflicts within a device until you find a tiny interstice among the countervailing forces, that sweet spot, where the device suddenly does what you want it to do. In the case of the glove, the sweet spot is the precise tradeoff of restraint and flexibility that will allow for maximum dexterity.<p>",1183310856

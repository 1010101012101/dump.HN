160927,comment,160732,160922,0,0,cturner,,,"""You can't run OS X on a normal PC either, and nobody considers it a dealbreaker""<p>Still - it's easy to buy hardware in which you can have confidence that OSX will work seamlessly. Not so with Ubuntu. Ubuntu is my preferred OS and I went through this recently while getting a new laptop.<p>Part of the problem is that people in the Linux world are so accustomed to having to do tweaks to get hardware working (and sneering at people like me who can't be bothered) that there's always a blur between hardware that ""works with ubuntu"" in the sense that you turn it on and get all functionality; or ""works with ubuntu"" in the sense that you can install it, invest lots of energy tweaking in order to get some functionality kind of working until you do the next major kernel upgrade.<p>Another example of Ubuntu not doing so well - wireless networking. The UI doesn't make sense, and is unhelpful when you can't get a connection. These are complete deal-breakers in terms of Ubuntu as a consumer OS.",1207914429

The bugs in keyboard shortcuts has been an exercise in balloon squeezing for as long as ubuntu has been around.<p>Another - audio. On a default install to my laptop sound didn't work at all, and now I can only play from one device at a time. I don't have these problems on my Apple.<p>Much as I love my ubuntu, it simply doesn't compare to the level of polish in XP, Vista and OSX.<p>> I don't think Windows itself is the big moneymaker, anyway<p>Why do you think that? I think that Windows is an spectacular moneymaker.<p>> Rather, I suspect they tend to pay people for using it, so they\n> could save money by moving away from it.<p>Not sure what you mean by this.

160915,comment,160408,160579,0,0,halo,,,"Whether Facebook can be replaced is an interesting question.<p>I'm leaning towards ""no"". For any site to replace Facebook it would require either many, many users to make the transition to another site or to outright leave making the site less useful for its users, and I honestly don't see that happening. Facebook is honestly nicely designed, has plenty of users and I can't see any killer app or nicer equivalent of Facebook appearing to make moving worthwhile.<p>The only thing that could replace Facebook is an unprecedented sharing of data between many significant players allowing interoperability between sites much like how E-Mail works. The existence of DataPortability may be a slow but sure approach towards this goal but there's too many factors to consider influencing whether this will ever actually happen. I certainly hope so in the long run - one site having the amount of influence that Facebook potentially can worries me.<p>Disclaimer: I don't actually use Facebook, and probably never will.",1207912428

It's easy to install, uses regular SQL and other RDBMS concepts, has some newer techniques for optimization out of the box (compression, joins, etc).

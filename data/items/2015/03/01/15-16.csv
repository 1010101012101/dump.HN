When you take the entire social history of the United States, a first black president is a monumental change and the institutions (academic or otherwise) that can claim any part of the credit for that, are falling over themselves to do so.<p>Again, my point is that the preoccupation people have with Schools like Harvard isn&#x27;t about academics but prestige.",1425225500

If you can live a fulfilled life as a nurse or PA, though, it&#x27;s a much better choice...</i><p>Aside from nurse or PA, is APRN or ARNP.  Not the same thing as a nurse at all.<p>My wife is an Advanced Practice Registered Nurse aka Nurse Practitioner.   She&#x27;s responsible for several hundred beds in a long term acute care facility, planning and setting the care for all these patients with the nursing staff carrying out her orders. MDs check their patients in and basically hand them off, leaving the critical care decisions in her hands while the MDs check back every 30 - 90 days, <i>maybe</i>.  In our state she doesn&#x27;t need to practice under some MD&#x27;s license, she&#x27;s a licensed care provider and prescriber in her own right.  She spends a lot of time in differential diagnosis, being House.  She&#x27;s the most senior practicing medical person in the building.<p>As far as I can tell, today&#x27;s NP is the general/internal medicine doc of the 1950s, with all the control and all the responsibility.  If you want to be responsible for overall medical care for patients, rather than a particular specialty, understanding and improving patient health end to end, this seems like a reasonable way to go.",1425225300

Demanding overtime pay through hinting at legal threats isn&#x27;t going make your relationship better.<p>Having to be comfortable selecting an appropriate number of &quot;allowances&quot; on w2 forms if you know you prefer to pay taxes later in the year even if the allowances do not represent havingb actual children etc.<p>Commitment for minimum 1-2 years, asking for time off within the first year can be hairy.<p>Giving no indication that you have other things going on in your life, that your full focus is on the company&#x27;s mission.<p>Pretending to be busy 8 hours a day at work even if you finished everything, because you don&#x27;t want to keep asking for something more to do, and make everyone else look bad<p>A lot of fulltime jobs are about socializing and having a mix of fun and productivity at a workplace with a group thrown together. While that may be what you want, keep in mind it will happen more than 8 hours a day for over 2 years in a &quot;good fit&quot; job.<p>=====<p>Compare all this to consulting. It&#x27;s less of a marriage. So:<p>Salary negotiations are more about quoting your rates, and having done different projects in the past you are under no obligation to play by their game of &quot;5% increase&quot;.<p>They pay for your time hourly not daily so they value it.<p>You are in full control of your tax withholding, working with your accountant, instead of waiting for a refund (and not earning interest).<p>Clients are HAPPY if you leave 3-4 months later if the project has been completed successfully. It&#x27;s about results, not appearances. You can take vacations between projects and still get recommendations from the (much more numerous) past clients. Did I mention that they are more numerous so you also have greater choice in who will give a reference?<p>As a consultant everyone understands you may have other clients where you use the same skills. Non-compete agreemeents are usually not enforceable when you are doing similar things for all clients - but exercise your ethical judgment. The point is you have the option and so your loyalty is valuable and there is mutual respect there.<p>You don&#x27;t have to pretend you are working when your job is done, and make others &quot;look bad&quot;. There are no such expectations. For me, the need to lie and pretend in a futime job was the most uncomfortable thing, even more than the commute. Did I mention the commute? Consulting jobs are less insistent on &quot;face time&quot; than they are about results, so you have more flexibility. You can attend conferences and events that benefit you as a professional in your industry, instead of genersting friction with your employer for how often you attend things not directly related to the company&#x27;s mission. And so you can develop yourself as an individual and as a professional in your industry.<p>Most consultants will flit from location to location, staying 3-4 months or working from home. You get to see a lot more people and environments. If you choose to stay in touch with 1 or 2 you can do it. The fact that you won&#x27;t be their &quot;fulltime friend&quot; is just a testament to how grown people can&#x27;t fully choose who to socialize with if they are in a fulltime environment. Better to get drinks or get together on the weekend with them, just like you still probably do with people who you once worked with.<p>=====<p>For me, the biggest draw is being able to enter into contracts based on mutual respect and the luxury of being honest in my commitments.<p>In short, just like marriage, fulltime jobs set much high expectations for commitment, and therefore you had better be sure that you and your contributions will be valued IN the relationship, when deciding IF to begin one. You have a choice. You can be placed by recruiters as a consultant also. The W2 arrangement with a consulting company is not about full-time employment, only about tax withholding and how they typically prefer to process the payments.<p>Not saying consulting is all roses, of course. But if you have a recruiter placing you anyway, consider it as the default (like dating) and FTE only if you&#x27;re really sold on a marriage and feel it&#x27;s going to work out.<p>Finally, I think the progression for many people is:<p>Employee -> Consultant -> Agency -> Entrepreneur -> Shareholder",1425224755

We&#x27;ve dominated our niche since 2005. When you see it, you&#x27;ll think: ah, that&#x27;s both cool and useful.<p>The site is built on PHP 5.6 / Kohana, MySQL, and jQuery. 99% of the code was written in-house and is clean, modular, built on a sane schema, and is easy to develop with minimal external dependencies. It&#x27;s also really fast; we&#x27;re near the top of the New Relic leaderboard for our category and in the 90th percentile of site speed according to Google. We take pride in what we built, and we&#x27;re looking for someone who is proud of their work to continue what we&#x27;ve started.<p>We&#x27;re seeking a developer who can spend approximately 20 hours a week working on discrete, meaningful projects on the site. We have more of these projects than we can count, so consider this a long term project where you&#x27;ll have the chance to work on a wide variety of interesting stuff, based on your skills and interest.<p>Here are a few real example projects that are coming up:\n* Integrate some additional song providers alongside iTunes and Amazon using our song search job queue.\n* Create the concept of timestamping for our data, modifying a variety of model and view classes, as well as adding Bootstrap modal components and forms in our templates.\n* Add features to our REST API.\n* Create front-end features for admins and superusers using HTML and jQuery.\n* Make a real-time activity section on our front page based on activity data we keep in redis.\n* Add a redis caching layer on top of our models to reduce MySQL query volume.\n* Add artist @handles to our tweets.\n* Plus many more...<p>We manage projects using a private Github repository and task list. Our specifications are short and to the point. Your code will go live on the site as soon as it&#x27;s ready -- no long release cycles.<p>Critically, you don&#x27;t need design or sysadmin skill to work on this project. At all. We expect you to generate good HTML structure but if you never touch our CSS or fiddle with images, that&#x27;s fine by us. Same goes for setting up servers, patching PHP, etc. We&#x27;ve got that all covered.<p>The ideal candidate will be able to show us what they&#x27;ve done using the technologies listed above. Experience with Laraval (likely future framework) and/or Kohana ideal, but not required. Honesty and strong communication skills are critical. Comfort with Github, pull requests, and the git toolchain generally is important -- we&#x27;ll ask for your Github username when we consider your application. We&#x27;ll give you all the support you need, but expect you to dive in and own large parts of our application.<p>Interested? Email amanda@tunefind.com",1425224657

If you want great front-line employees it would seem there are other hundreds of other schools that can do that.<p>When it comes to having great leaders, race matters.  I wish it didn&#x27;t, but its naïve to think otherwise.  That said, simply awarding points for race (if that&#x27;s what is actually done -- or if they have just regressed it to show the differential) seems inefficient.<p>You want people with great upside to make a positive change in the world.  Being around some of the highest SAT/GPA people in the world for my life has shown that most end up having good, but mundane careers.  And what I find surprising is that I probably could have predicted which of my cohort, colleagues, and associates would go on to have outsized impacts -- and it was rarely (or more like never) a product of their SAT score.<p>Sports is one of the better professions where performance trumps almost everything.  If you talk to NFL scouts you&#x27;ll find that they look numbers, but they realize that the numbers come with very strong context.  Incredible passing numbers in the SEC are different than from a DIII school.  They want to know if you&#x27;ve peaked in college, or if you have upside in the NFL.<p>The NFL also does something similar to college -- they have later rounds in the draft, because they have a large enough roster to take some risks (and practice squads).  These later rounds are where they often take riskier players.  This is where Seattle takes a slower cornerback named Richard Sherman or a shorter QB named Russell Wilson.  Based on the tape, neither of these players should be in the NFL, much less excelling.  But the upside potential was huge on them -- so Seattle picked them.<p>I&#x27;m sure Harvard could have found someone with better numbers than Barack Obama, but the upside on him was huge.<p>Given the ridiculous importance our society puts on race, I&#x27;m not against using race a metric.

Personally, I just place a higher emphasis on teamwork.<p>You seem to be assuming that candidates somehow know that you are not going to attempt to fleece them, unlike every other prospective employer.<p>If candidates don&#x27;t know any better, and it&#x27;s fair for them to assume that you are the same as all the others, then I don&#x27;t think you can draw any conclusions about &quot;trust&quot; and &quot;teamwork&quot; from them refusing to state a figure.<p>> More often than not that lack of trust shows up in their work and their effectiveness as part of the team. Not always but more than 50/50.<p>I think you&#x27;re probably just seeing a correlation with the sort of people who either negotiate well already, or have read up or received advice on what to do.<p>But if you still choose not to make an offer on this basis, I suppose it&#x27;s win-win - the candidates you turn down probably wouldn&#x27;t want to work for you anyway.",1425224179

Doctors can’t start making real money until they’re at least 29, and often not until they’re much older.&quot;<p>Residents start making $50k salaries right out of medical school. It&#x27;s only a 4 year delay from nurses.<p>It&#x27;s not about money. It&#x27;s about quality of life. Medical school is really hard. Residency is brutal. Constant unrelenting pressure. No sleep. No personal time. That alone is the reason why becoming a doctor isn&#x27;t worth it for most people.<p>Watch the part in the video starting at 3:08 where they&#x27;re half way through residency. They look like they&#x27;re going to cry. I&#x27;m so glad I did those interviews because it really captures the personal sacrifices you have to make.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing that the article failed to grasp, though. If you need to be the one doing the cutting in surgery or the one pushing medicine forward with research, you have to get that MD. Some people need to be in control and call the shots.<p>If that&#x27;s you, do it. Make the sacrifices, because you won&#x27;t be happy doing anything else.<p>If you can live a fulfilled life as a nurse or PA, though, it&#x27;s a much better choice for most people.",1425224148

9127369,comment,9126190,9126190,0,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;m married into a first generation Asian family and this is a constant topic of conversation on that side, especially now that their kids are getting ready for college.<p>The problem ultimately stems from a huge wave of mostly Korean and Chinese immigrants (but by extension other East Asian and Pacific Island nations get penalized as well), who grew up in poor countries (or when their countries were poor), suddenly finding themselves with enough money to immigrate to the U.S. and &quot;escape&quot;. They put down roots, work their tails off and start having families.<p>They don&#x27;t want their kids to have to struggle like they did (and they want to ensure they set themselves up well in retirement), but they have incredibly unsophisticated views of what &#x27;success&#x27; means in America (often as a result of working so much they never really had a chance to integrate well into their adopted country).<p>However, they understand passing tests, having deep cultural histories around test taking to get ahead in life. So they look for the most prestigious work you can test into.<p>And bam, at the intersection of hard work, prestige signaling and test taking you get a fairly limited set of occupations, which these parents instinctively laser beam their kids at.<p>Good schools want extracurriculars? No problem! Let&#x27;s use the prestige button on that, prestigious schools must want the <i>most</i> prestigious extracurriculars, and those are obviously piano and violin (and sometimes opera). Let&#x27;s toss in some prestige sports as well, and now these kids and splitting time studying endlessly for tests to become a doctor or lawyer, practicing piano/violin and playing tennis/golf/figure skating.<p>Repeat until the parents think they&#x27;re maximizing the fitting function for university acceptance and you end up with entire social networks and minor industries around SAT test taking, piano and violin teachers and tennis/golf/figure skating coaches.<p>And you know what? For a very long time this worked. Asian Americans have been extraordinarily and consistently &quot;successful&quot;, far over-represented in university admissions and in select professions.<p>But there was no secret, it was literally hard screaming, crying, kicking work. There&#x27;s no cheating. While their other raced peers studied for an hour every night before turning on the XBox. They studied till midnight, every night, and then spent all day Saturday at private school, then studied till midnight again, then spent most of the day on Sundays doing prestige extracurriculars. Their parents were often poor, working crap triple-D jobs, or triple shifts at convenience stores. They lived frugally and invested every single drop of blood in their kids. Even if they were often wrong headed about how they did it, it worked and anybody can do it.<p>But on the university side, as parents start to find the optimal mix to acceptance, application packets start to look not just virtually identical, but absolutely identical.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re tasked with figuring out which 10 of 1000 applications all with the last names Kim, Chin, Hu, Lee, Park, Wang or Choi should be accepted:<p>- All have 4.0 GPAs<p>- All have AP degrees from High School<p>- All have extracurriculars that are selected from the set of {violin, piano, opera, tennis, golf}<p>- All went to the best High Schools in their respective areas<p>- All submit essays with some story about their parent&#x27;s difficult immigration, usually involving stories of poverty and unbelievable work hours in menial jobs. Maybe with some kind of &quot;escape from the communists&quot; or &quot;swimming to safety across Hong Kong Harbor&quot; or something. I know 3 Chinese Americans who&#x27;s parents have almost identical &quot;swimming escape from China and lived in Kowloon Walled City for 3 years before making it to America&quot; stories.<p>- All have perfect or near perfect SAT scores<p>What the universities are of course realizing is that it becomes a random sample at this point. There&#x27;s no criteria they can use to discern one &#x27;Kim&#x27; from another &#x27;Lee&#x27;...every applicant literally looks exactly the same. There&#x27;s no &quot;fair&quot; way to select from this applicant pool, and this pool has quite literally self-grouped.<p>So, clumsily, the universities are trying to throw big rocks in the pool. These are starting to no longer accept the products of this application optimum, <i>especially</i> if they have Asian-American last names.<p>It&#x27;s getting heard, and in the parts of the Asian American community I&#x27;m privy to, mothers are stressed out that all those years of forcing their kids to master Bach aren&#x27;t going to count for much. They&#x27;re in a mad scramble to figure out the next optimized path, but the universities are smart to it now.<p>They also don&#x27;t come from cultures where the notion of cultivating meaningful hobbies is well understood. My niece loves waterpainting and flower arranging. Gifts of art supplies and arrangement books are met with skepticism and sometimes scorn. She won&#x27;t have time to be forced to practice piano if she&#x27;s dilly-dallying around with another painting! Yet, a portfolio of prints and some awards from local flower shows would be <i>exactly</i> what the universities are now looking for. The idea that maybe she should be encouraged to develop her own innate interests is lost while he parents look for the next magical prestige signalling instrument for her to be forced to study. My other family back in the home country are trying to understand it better, but they still haven&#x27;t gotten over the idea that being &quot;a hobby photographer&quot; doesn&#x27;t have to mean spending $25,000 on pro-level camera equipment.<p>Coincidentally, the second generation of Asian Americans are having kids and <i>those</i> kids are often growing up without all this mess, but still affected by the continued wave of new first generations. Now Rebecca Choi, who&#x27;s parents didn&#x27;t push her through the Harvard funnel is getting impacted by Hee Soo who did. But Rebecca is interested in becoming a writer, has a 3.2 GPA, stinks at math, dyes her hair pink, listens to rock music, is trying to learn to play guitar, volunteers as a drill coach for her local girl&#x27;s basketball league. Had a pregnancy scare her junior year. Has experimented with drugs a little. Her SATs were above average, but not spectacular.<p>If she was <i>another</i> minority she might make it into a tier-1 school. If she was white she probably wouldn&#x27;t. But now because Hee Soo&#x27;s parents tiger mom&#x27;d her through the perceived application optimum, Rebecca, for no other reason than being a Choi, gets a 50 point application deduction. Does this mean the system worked? Rebecca would just be an average white kid if she was Rebecca Smith.",1425223914

What was important however was how many companies were competing for you, how profitable those companies were, and the current state of the economy.<p>This implies that a negotiation like this is just back-and-forth-ing within some window of acceptability that was probably predetermined before you walked in, and if you want to have a successful salary negotiation and get your prospective (or current) employer to <i>redefine</i> that window, your best bet is to a) orchestrate (some) of these external factors to work in your favour; and b) find a way to get that information into the exchanges without being a dick.<p>They also noted that doing all this then staying with your current employer was often the best strategy because at the very least you can expect to capture some of the hiring/firing costs associated with replacing you.",1425223613

When I returned from an 8 month leave in 2013, immediately upon hearing my whistle she has known since she was in the egg, she flew down to roost on a power line above my head and sat with me in silence for an extended period. I&#x27;ve been gifted by frequent, non-aggressive fly overs and twice she/they dropped &#x27;gifts&#x27; of a half eaten rat and a hare quarter at my feet. When I work in the yard or on my autos, they choose to idle the hot parts of the day in lower perches in my yard rather than in their preferred higher, more shaded spots.

Otherwise, they might start at 90k.<p>Another reason, less important than the previous, is that (if they ask early in the process), it can keep you from spending 2 weeks interviewing with a company that can&#x27;t afford you.<p>This happened to me a lot when I was hiring. I didn&#x27;t have an HR department to mechanically set incoming salaries; that was my job. I didn&#x27;t mind candidates who wouldn&#x27;t disclose; in fact, early on, I yelled at my partners for asking candidates the question. But I came to learn that the number is very useful for speeding negotiation up and avoiding offense.<p>Even at the highest level of company management, where surplus dollars stood a good chance of going directly into my bank account, my incentive was never really <i>intrinsically</i> to minimize the cost of an employee. The bigger pull was maintaining parity with the rest of the team.<p>One thing this article suggests, but you should be careful about: you can disqualify yourself by giving numbers that are too high. If you say you want 180k and the role goes for 110k-120k, there are hiring managers that will pass on you even though you could be negotiated to the realistic range. They&#x27;ll assume that to hire you, you have to be squeezed, and they don&#x27;t want team members they have to squeeze, because good managers track retention too.",1425223274

9127231,comment,9126190,9126669,0,0,wozniacki,,,"Although I sense that none of the following is likely to pacify the general grating sentiment of the arguments here, I will venture anyway:<p><pre><code>  “We could fill our class twice over with valedictorians,”\n  Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust told an\n  audience at the Aspen Ideas Festival, sponsored by the \n  Aspen Institute and The Atlantic, on Monday. That\n  means admissions officers rely on intangibles like \n  interesting essays or particularly unusual \n  recommendations to decide who comprises the 5.9 percent\n  of applicants who get in. \n\n  Faust&#x27;s top tip for raising a Harvard man or woman: \n  “Make your children interesting!”\n\n  For parents and students alike, that’s both good news \n  and bad news. The bad news is that of course it’s much\n  easier to say that than to actually make it happen, \n  though Faust recommended encouraging children to follow\n  their passions as a way to develop an interesting \n  personality. It’s much easier to complete a checklist, \n  however daunting, than to actually be interesting.\n\n  But the good news is that when colleges use this set \n  of criteria, kids can focus on shaping their teenage\n   years in a way that isn’t just about trying to build\n  up resume line after resume line, and instead focus on\n  a more holistic sense of self. That seems like a far \n  more sensible way to move through high school than\n  spreading oneself too thin trying to get a slew of \n  positions one can’t really ever concentrate on. That\n  encourages a dilettantish approach to learning and \n  society that is just the opposite of what the liberal \n  arts have traditionally tried to encourage.[1]\n</code></pre>\nI mention this not because it captures the whole truth of the way one gets into Harvard. But because it is almost alluring an argument that anyone - whether a Harvard, a YC, a Hackerspace / co-living community, the approval process at a highly prized co-op building in New York, a dating app ( The League [2] ) - could use ( and do use ) &quot;to winnow out the chaff&quot;, so to speak.<p>Is it fair that a co-op uses some strange criteria to let a bigwig, say a political donation bundler, with connections, have the penthouse and not you ? No.<p>Would you dare fight the co-op and take them to court to prove you are just as &quot;interesting&quot; as the bundler?<p>Are you likely to win? Are you not likely to appease the co-op board through some other means because you know it is the socially-acceptable way to do so and suing them is just going to make you a social outcast and expunged from the social diaries of the well-heeled?<p>Is it fair that a group of people self-select themselves to be part of a dating club, so as to not being put through the grief of having to date a person who doesn&#x27;t - from all social cues and signalling - doesn&#x27;t belong? [2]<p>Is it wrong? Yes. Is it illegal? No.<p>Their lawyer is sure to say that no one is stopping you from building your own app and inviting people only you approve of. After all it is a private app.<p>I could give examples of even more explicit discrimination in daily life that go unchallenged.<p>One cannot cherry-pick an issue when it suits them and choose to shift it to the back-burner when it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Discrimination is rampant, persistent and has become acceptable in all manner of ways - both latent and in plain sight.<p>It is too important an issue to be fought in piece-meal, from one aggrieved party to another.<p>We ought to have a much bigger, much more encompassing and thorough discussion of what it means to be discriminated - whether the person is non-Jewish white, Jewish, Asian, Black, Hispanic or the rest.<p>[1] How to Get Into Harvard<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/how-to-get-into-harvard/373726/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/06/how-to-...</a><p>[2] The League<p><a href=""http://www.theleagueapp.co/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theleagueapp.co/</a><p>edit: formatting",1425222244

9127215,comment,9126585,9126585,0,0,byuu,,,"(I initially posted this on the Reddit thread yesterday, but I thought I&#x27;d repeat it here since there are many programmer types who might attempt this here.)<p>From the article:<p>> Of course, because we replaced the function with our own, we have to actually swap the buffers by explicitly calling the original glutSwapBuffer() function. I did this by undoing the hook, calling the original function and hooking it again.<p>Background qualification: I do this sort of debug launcher + DLL injection thing a lot. For one example with source, see my tool header magic ( <a href=""http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/796/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/796/</a> )<p>As someone with experience, please take it from me: this is a really bad idea. If you rewrite functions to call the originals, it becomes possible for another thread to call that function in the middle of your rewrite, and end up executing illegal instructions. Not only is this theoretically possible, it routinely happens all the time. Even when you think for sure that your program is not multi-threaded. Even something like hooking a Windows file size function, you&#x27;ll learn that the open file dialog on Windows Vista+ is threaded, and will bomb out on you with alarming frequency.<p>The proper way to do this is to create &quot;trampolines&quot; instead. The idea is that you copy the first few instructions from the original routine, and put them somewhere else. And at the end, you jump back into the original function after your patched jump. The address of where you put the original instructions is your pointer to the &quot;original function&quot; that you can use if you want.<p>So basically, something like this:<p><pre><code>    originalFunction:\n      opcode1\n      opcode2\n      opcode3\n</code></pre>\nBecomes:<p><pre><code>    originalFunction:\n      jmp detourFunction\n      nop <padding>\n    resumeAddress:\n      opcode3\n    \n    trampolineFunction:\n      opcode1\n      opcode2\n      jmp resumeAddress\n    \n    detourFunction:\n      <do your function hooking magic here; modify arguments; whatever>\n      call trampolineFunction <only if you want to>\n      <do whatever you want with the results from the original function call>\n</code></pre>\nNow, I know this sounds horrifyingly complicated: you probably think you&#x27;ll need a full-on x86/amd64 disassembler+assembler. And it&#x27;s theoretically possible to make a near-impossible function to trampoline. But keep in mind that 99% of APIs are built in higher level languages, and as such, have very consistent function prologues (usually saving the stack frame.) So in practice, you can write trampoline installers using one or two &quot;signatures&quot; and hook nearly every function you&#x27;d ever want to.<p>But if that seems too challenging, there is also a library called Detours ( <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/</a> ) that you could try instead. I didn&#x27;t find it necessary for my own purposes.",1425222011

Sitting down with them at least prevented them from going off and doing negative work all day.  The result was pretty consistent output from the team, which is what companies aim for.  It was less productive than firing the incompetent people and letting me do their work instead, however.  (Incidentally, this makes it sound like I didn't get along with my coworkers, which was not at all true.  After we started pairing, we all got along <i>too well</i>, and started wasting the entire day socializing instead of programming.  Oops.)<p>Anyway, now that I don't have coworkers like this, I find it's easier to go off on my own.  I also don't find it particularly useful to write a failing test and make it pass, I tend to alternate between big batches of code, a batch of passing tests, some todo tests, and then making that all work again.<p>YMMV, but you have to keep in mind that things like XP, Scrum, Agile, TDD, etc. are designed to make big groups do things in a consistent amount of time, so that the code works reasonably well and it is delivered in a predictable amount of time.<p>It is not necessarily a good way to do things if you are a good programmer.  (Strict rules are for robots, not artists.)",1235267974

But there's a big difference between spreading gossip and exercising one's shareholder rights.<p>Yes, Steve Jobs gave up his expectation of the level of privacy you or I enjoy when he became the CEO of a massively successful, publicly traded company. But that doesn't mean that it's right to violate his privacy.<p>If you are an Apple shareholder trying to exercise your rights, that's fine. But 99% of the stuff written about Jobs' condition feels intrusive, and I would feel uncomfortable writing it myself.",1235267930

(I did a dual-boot, and I thought I'd have to manually partition but didn't because it knew what it was doing.)<p>The actual install is fast and comprehensive. It sets up a lot for you. I remember having to install X on Free BSD not that long ago (maybe 5 years).<p>I've had good luck with wifi cards, but that is still sometimes an issue.<p>25 hours seems like a really long time (Unless you're counting hours of ignoring it while it updates and installs all the programs you pick. That is pretty slow.)<p>I'm not sure what you were doing, but I've set it up on several laptops and desktops and never had to spend more than 2ish hours of my time getting it setup.

490285,comment,490173,490261,0,0,jrockway,,,"You are ""missing out"" on ""code generation"".<p>Apparently some languages have so much verbose boilerplate that the only way to be productive in such a language is to pick the boilerplate out of a menu when you need it.  Or so the IDE folks say.  (Other problems include insane organizational schemes that require the computer to move code between specifically-named files in order for your app to run.)<p>Anyway, the IDE thing is a classic example of a ""local maximum"".  The language made a bunch of bad decisions, and the only to get productive again was to invent an incredibly complex tool to abstract away some insanity.  Sure, it's kind of good.  But if you threw both away and started over, you'd get a better maximum with less complexity.  The word ""blub"" comes to mind.<p>So in the end, you are exactly right -- if you are using a reasonable programming language.  If you are using Java, you need all the help you can get.  (And yes, I mean that in two ways.)",1235267302

490279,comment,490054,490239,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"From a marketing standpoint, Linux is priced wrong. It's free, so it attracts people who expect to get something for nothing. A lot of those people walk away disappointed.<p>Mac users understand that the Mac OS is worth money -- otherwise they'd be Linux users. So they look at a $400 machine running the Mac OS as a huge bargain, and are happy to go through all sorts of pain in exchange for it.<p>Of course, if the Hackintosh movement catches on there will be a new class of people who -- being too cheap to buy an actual Mac --  will try the Hackintosh route, encounter problems (installation difficulties, subtle bugs that destroy data, apps that don't work, OS upgrades that cause their machines to break) and gripe about it. Which will subtly tarnish Apple's brand. This is why Apple's lawyers are so vicious about this stuff.",1235267015
490278,comment,490255,490255,0,0,thomaspaine,,,"Depends on what type of website you're hosting. If you're going to host something simple like a wordpress blog or static content, I would suggest <a href=""https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/</a>. You only pay for the bandwidth that you use, as opposed to a normal monthly payment plan where you have a fixed amount of bandwidth. They have nice privacy protection options and you can also use them to register domains (I think $8.95 for a year).<p>The downside with nearly free speech is that you can't host persistent processes there, which means no Rails, Django, etc. apps. For my Django apps I've been using Webfaction, which I've been pretty happy with. The cheapest tier is a shared hosting environment for $9.95 a month, or $8.95 if you lock in for a year. That tier gives you enough memory and bandwidth to prototype and launch your apps with a small user base, and then if you need to, you can just upgrade your account.<p>Oh wait, I just noticed that you're a university student! You should check to see what your options are for hosting your website on the university network. Most schools give students free hosting options. I know plenty of people who host their websites on university accounts for free, although once you start getting hammered with traffic you might have to switch to a commercial host. You might have to go through the process of setting up your own server rather than just taking advantage of the pre-installed configuration you would get from a shared hosting environment like webfaction. But then again, learning how to configure apache can't hurt.",1235266883

490272,comment,490054,490054,0,0,voidpointer,,,"All whining about how running OSX on non-apple hardware ruins the ""Apple Expiience""... Isn't this supposed for ""love"" of OS X cannibalizing the exact same thing it is evangelizing?<p>This is based on the assumption that Apple is able to develop a superior operating system because they can support the effort with hardware sales. If everyone would install their copy of OSX on hardware where Apple doesn't make money, how can they continue to improve OSX?<p>They might start to license the ""right"" to run OSX o hardware manufacturers but that would get them into the same compatibility hell Microsoft has gotten themselves into. I can very well understand how they don't want to get into that spot.<p>It's a nice pass-time and I don't think it hurts anyone given the small scale on which this is happening. Plus it may keep the folks in Cupertino on their toes for coming up with better hardware in the future.<p>Furthermore, as for the Linux comparisons. This clearly shows how Linux' most glaring deficiency is the lack of a consistent UI experience. There is a heavily fragmented mess bolted on top of dear old X11. It works - sort of - and as long as you stay within your chosen camp (Gnome, KDE...) you might not be off too bad.

The important thing is not so much the interaction with people at the other end, but just the seeing.  Kind of like the way people love showing a just-taken digital photograph to the assembled group.",1213009000
212689,comment,212005,212216,0,0,olavk,,,"CSS is almost always quicker, easier and more powerful than  equivalent presentational markup.<p>The problem with tables is that Internet Explores does not support the ""dislay:table"" property, which is the CSS equivalent to table layout. So if you want a certain kind of grid-like layout <i>and</i> you want to support Internet Explorer, you have to choose:
1) either emulate the layout using CSS constructs which were not designed for this purpose.
2) use tables<p>However this is not a shortcoming of CSS, it is a shortcoming of Internet Explorer. display:table has been part of the CSS standard for <i>10 years</i>.<p>I wrote an article <a href=""http://olav.dk/articles/tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://olav.dk/articles/tables.html</a> to describe the specific context where it makes sense to use tables rather than CSS. In all other cases, CSS is better.",1213008896

212677,comment,212479,212479,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"When my mother died about 6 months ago it was hard, but I was surprised at how fast i could put my self together and concentrate on my real dreams.  I started to learn programming for seriously(before that it was just some curiosity) Started orienting myself and stopped wasting time, because I realised i have no time to lose. You have to be great and have to work hard at your goals. I still wish my mother's guidance and support were here, but i manage pretty well on my own. In the morning when my aunt came to tell me she said ""you are a philosopher,you understand, life sometimes sucks"" It takes some philosophical patience and understanding to deal with a tragedy, and its always hard. Hope you all take care of yourselfs and not do stupid things, just try to understand your situation and take time to heal if its needed. I needed only a week before i started school again and its nice to talk to people. If i have something as an advice it should be something like ""Don't isolate yourself"" I know some hackers are loners by nature(im a pretty extreme case) but its good to be around people, that's why we gather in times of tragedy.",1213007554

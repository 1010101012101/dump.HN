SO PUT THAT REQUIREMENT IN YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION! If this is a deal breaker and you fail to inform the candidate, the person wasting everyone's time is YOU.<p>To put some things you dismissed into perspective:<p>- Sometimes a company already knows that the candidate is leaving, in which case they are being helpful by telling you it will take some time to get a release on the code they want to submit.<p>- If someone passes you proprietary code without permission, bravo! You've just weeded out an untrustworthy candidate and you didn't even need to take it to the in-person interview! A huge time saver!<p>- Junior programmers straight out of school rarely have a bunch of open source code. They're fresh out into the field, looking for someone to mentor and guide them as they grow. There's a mountain of things they need to learn and another mountain they need to unlearn, and they're wide open to whatever culture you find important. If you're not up to the task, don't hire them. Don't even approach them.<p>Getting all bent out of shape over these things is a symptom of much deeper issues within yourself.",1341237449

I was giving you the benefit of the doubt while reading the comments, but your phrase ""It would mean that our designs are simple enough for a homeless person to use!"" really, really, REALLY rubs me the wrong way. Whether you notice it or not, whether you intend it or not, you are sounding incredibly patronizing to other human beings. It makes you sound sheltered and ignorant. Both in the way you phrase your story (Homeless people can be interesting?!?!) and in this concept that designs would need to be ""simple"" or someone who is homeless to use.<p>I suggest spending a LOT more time outside talking to strangers if you think you need to ""simplify"" things for homeless people.

Anyone who works with the twitter API for any amount of time can recognise the potential for pushing Ads down the API pipe. I'm guessing they looked at it and the numbers didn't add up. Thinking about it there are lots of challenges with such a proposal. Top of the list would be control of the visual display of ads. Google maintain tight control of Adwords and Adsense. As does Facebook - and I'm sure they'll do so when they roll out their Adsense competitor. Taking it further there would be nothing to stop me from detecting ads which get sent down the pipes and not displaying them.<p>I think the Ad guys just see this is being too complicated and to be fair I suspect they might be right.

These were people concerned about Liberty before there even were colonies.  There was no great farmland available.  There was no Mississippi.  There weren't even any slaves to leverage as resources.  Yet, if you read the historical records, those early settlers wanted mostly to get away from the oppressive States of Europe.  Freedom was their issue and it was tightly ingrained in the American culture from the beginning.<p>Fast-forward to the American Revolution (all about Liberty, read the writings of the Revolutionaries), and you'll see that these people were fanatics about restraining the central government long before it even had any interest in anything outside of the 13 colonies.<p>> An Amerindian displaced from the Mississippi 200 yrs ago or a homeless Black 50 yrs ago won't understand any of the ""liberty"" and ""rule of law"" there's been.<p>Slavery was horrible and really the poison that was allowed into the US founding that led to the destruction of the notion of States' Rights when we fought over the issue during the Civil War.  That original sin has pretty much cost us our Liberty, since after the Federal government forced its supremacy it broke the ability of States to protect themselves.  It shifted the American power structure from being bottom-up to top-down.<p>Amerindians were killing and DISPLACING each other over primitive tribal issues long before we arrived.  Unfortunately for them, the European technological advantage was so great.  That said, I like to think that we've learned a lot as a society as we proved after World War I and beyond where we never tried to keep by force any land where we fought battles for some cause.<p>You bring up an unintentionally interesting point:  If American resources and geography were such a societal advantage, then why isn't the Amerindian culture the most dominant in the world now?  They had numbers, access to the same resources, geographic isolation to protect them from other countries for centuries, etc.  But they never progressed and became ""important"" as a society.  Even after Europeans showed up and allowed them access to our technology, they used some of it pragmatically (horses and guns), but they never embraced the cultural underpinnings that would have allowed them to challenge us.",1341235891

I even went to the mat with another cofounder who questioned whether he was the right fit. Turns out he wasn't. It wasn't his fault. He's very talented, but he duplicated existing skillsets (mine most of all), and the hat we needed him to wear was one that he'd never worn before. And this increased the stress of his job, which only made it even harder for him to be productive.<p>Fortunately, the other founders agreed to be generous about offering him an exit (in line with Fred's advice), and so when he and I had the conversation it was much easier for his departure to be a mutual decision and we've retained our friendship.<p>I would never go into a conversation like this unprepared and rely on the assumption it will be easy or mutual.

The problem is the gatekeepers AKA the TSA and border police. A quick google search on TSA will give you all the information you need to make an educated choice on where not to spend your holidays.<p>Until this is fixed, I cannot see how the USA can beat places like Taiwan, China, anywhere in Europe (except maybe Germany), Australia, or Iceland for the image of ""welcoming tourists."" It's purely anecdotal as it's an opinion, of course. Take it or leave it :)",1341234529

Something that seems cluttered and useless to you is a selling point for someone else.<p>I have personal anecdotes for the two examples of Android and iOS clutter you mentioned. Again, different things are important to different users.<p>For me, part of the reason I got a Nexus One a couple of years ago was that I could make my home screen more useful than just app launchers. For pretty much the whole time I've had the phone I have had a home screen that includes a widget to turn on and off my led flashlight, a widget displaying the weather for the next 24 hours and a widget to call my wife directly.<p>In regards to iOS, I was actually just having a conversation with my wife the other day about her being able to easily reject a call on her iPhone.<p>You could certainly chalk my anecdote up to being a power user, but my wife is not the type to be installing and tweaking Linux. :-)",1341234492

When the EC2 instance terminates (and it will, eventually) your server goes down and all your data stored on the ephemeral disk is gone.<p>What you need to do instead is setup an auto-scaling group that automatically launches a new EC2 instance to replace the terminated one. You also need to set up boot scripts that automatically configure the newly launched instance to run your app, or alternatively create a custom AMI image that's preconfigured to run it on boot.<p>And if you store stateful data (like the MySQL in LAMP), you need to setup boot scripts to attach a EBS volume to store the data on. Or alternatively just use RDS which does it for you.",1341234429

Went back and improved on several things and continuing to do that.<p>We have a good roadmap of solutions to provide you everything you need to run business. Analytics and a few other useful integrations based on customer inputs is in the works. We are still in private beta working with a short list of customers whom we are working with closely (though we are unable to serve everyone immediately as some of the payment integrations are due to be completed by July / August).<p>We have integrations readily available with BraintreePayments (US), Samurai (not sure if they still do underwrite new accounts and we did this earlier), WorldPay (Singapore). Authorize.net will be ready in another week.<p>And we support multiple payment gateway integration. We do not have a vault to store card with us and we store in the respective payment gateway.<p>Here is the link to our API docs: <a href=""https://apidocs.chargebee.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apidocs.chargebee.com/</a><p>I am one of the founders and will be happy to help. :)",1341234333

5088420,comment,5088260,5088260,4,0,fencepost,,,"I know that some of the Mac crowd love the small-screen options and my previous laptop was a 12"" 1280x800, but I can't imagine working routinely on a screen that small in either inches or resolution these days.<p>The biggest question is how are you going to be using it? Mostly at a desk with an external monitor as well? On airplanes in coach? Any client presentations?<p>What I ordered earlier this year is a Lenovo T430 with the resolution bumped to 1600x900 ($+50) on a 14"" screen; they now also have the T430s (slim) and T430u (ultrabook) which are both thinner and lighter. If you want larger, the T530 lets you go up to FHD (1920x1080) but at a significantly higher cost.<p>Looking briefly now, the T430u drawbacks include a limit of 8GB (probably a single slot), no mSATA or WWAN slot, and a display of 1366x768 with no choices. That last would've disqualified it for me immediately.<p>The T430s weighs a bit more and has more options, but also starts around $950 and that extra money really only buys you about 12 ounces less weight. I was looking hard at budget, so it also wasn't an option.<p>I'd recommend the T430 with a third-generation processor (specifically for HD4000 graphics). There's a nvidia option using Optimus, but I'm not sure how good it is under Linux (or whether it really buys you much performance). Bump the screen to 1600x900, bump the Wifi up to the 3x3 option (both things you can't really add later and which don't add that much to the cost). DO Add the fingerprint reader; smart cards and color sensors only if they fit your needs. Also add the backlit keyboard - you can't get it later, and when you need it it's really kind of nice to have. Also add Bluetooth up front. If you're ordering one, start with the lower model (not the ""with Faster Processing"" one), you can upgrade the CPU during the selection process but not downgrade it from the more expensive starting point. Starting from the lower model also lets you get Windows 7 (Home or Pro) instead of Windows 8 if you're going to keep Windows at all and don't like the Metro UI.<p>I stuck with the smallest HD and stock 4GB, adding another SODIMM to go to 12GB was dirt cheap, and I'm easily able to run KUbuntu in VMWare Player under Windows 7 Pro. You can replace the optical drive with a HD caddy for under $20 and have a second SATA III drive; you can add either WWAN -or- a mSATA drive (SATA II), there's some form of caching that can be set up with mSATA but I didn't bother. If you're going the full disconnected user route, you can add assorted battery options to get you up to (theoretically) 30 hours, 6-8 is easily feasible by just upgrading the stock battery - I haven't seen the ""up to 9.7"" with the 6-cell battery but I suspect that going to a SSD would be a big part of that.<p>After you get it, set up a power-on and hard drive password in the BIOS and configure the fingerprint reader under Windows to let you bypass those with a swipe. Throw on TrueCrypt and encrypt the entire drive as well.<p>One caveat with the newer ThinkPads, they did fiddle with the keyboard but it's still great. The big key I miss is the Menu key (right-click equivalent), but you can emulate it with Shift-F10 on Windows.<p>Physical keys that aren't present and workarounds:\nContext Menu/right-click = Shift-F10\nBreak = Fn-B\nSysRq = Fn-S\nScrLk = Fn-C\nPause = Fn-P<p>And finally the page/screen forward and back buttons were replaced and the pageup/pagedown buttons moved to be with the cursor keys.",1358719027

5088409,comment,5083175,5088093,2,0,robomartin,,,"> If you had done any serious dealing with colors you would know<p>And that's the end of the conversation, isn't it?<p>You could have simply modified your program based on my friendly input and do it correctly.  How was jabbing me in the eye a better choice?  Particularly when you don't even know me.  That's unfortunate.<p>Perhaps you might consider emailing me privately?  I'll provide you with references.  See my HN profile for the address.<p>I have only devoted somewhere between 20 to 25 years of my life to, among other things, deal with accurate color and image processing in both hardware and software.  So, yeah, I know a thing or two about the subject.<p>There's doing it right and there's doing it wrong.  Averaging RGB values to derive grayscale is --and I am trying hard not to say what I really want to say-- not the right way to do it.<p>Part of the context here is to consider the source of the images you might be processing.  The very design of every single camera in the market is based on a relationship between these color primaries that is to be maintained across the processing pipeline.<p>No device I know of will uniformly average the RGB channels as this is simply the wrong way to process and deal with color accurately.  You can get away with this kind of thing for very specific applications (if you are computationally limited AND know exactly what you are doing).<p>Even then, you can, as I have done in hardware a few times, massage the coefficients to better reflect reality.  One such example is the implementation of a ""cheap"" motion detection facility in hardware (FPGA).  In this case floating point math is not an option (and it wouldn't make sense) so you can either futz with the coefficients or use a set of pre-computed lookup tables to do it accurately.<p>In some cases you can even ignore red and blue and just use green as reference.  Again, just like before, knowing the application and fully understanding what you are doing is critical when making such choices.<p>In this case you are trying to detect edges in an image that is, more than likely, not artificial.  In other words, it might be a photograph.  It, more than likely, came through or is a JPG image.  This means that the image, regardless of source, was converted to YCbCr color space and then handed back to you as RGB.  If you  want to accurately work with actual image data and not some distorted, contrast-reduced or contrast altered grayscale image the only way to do it is to recover the Y component from the RGB source data by using the correct mathematical approach.<p>Really, it ain't that hard:<p>Y = (0.299 * R) + (0.587 * G) + (0.114 * B)<p>This corresponds to CCIR601.  Things can get a little confusing as the primaries were modified slightly for REC709 (another imaging standard).  JPEG is defined around CCIR601 primaries, so the above noted coefficients are correct for that application.<p>To anyone dealing with color professionally these shortcut ""solutions"" reveal nothing but utter ignorance in the underlying science.  I do not intend this as an insult, it's just a fact.  Saving a very specific and valid reason for taking such shortcuts these ""solutions"" are always a bad idea.<p>I happen to have a pretty good handle on --among other things-- color science. I am, however, clueless about building rockets.  That said, if I wanted to build a rocket you can bet I'd spend a non-trivial amount of time learning as much about the subject as possible before using uninformed shortcut solutions.<p>Real Color Scientists cringe at this sort of stuff because, in darker times, it made it into all kinds of programs written by color-science-ignorant programmers.  These programs caused untold havoc with image processing.  Thankfully things are far better now as those doing serious work with images have taken the time to understand and learn about color science.<p>If you really want to learn to process images properly and accurately forget that the idea of (R+G+B)/3 ever existed, remove it from your vocabulary and replace it with the above.<p>Also, go browse around the Rochester Institute of Technology website.  I spent a bit of time there.  Color Science is one of their focal points.  Lots of good info there, even a number of interesting courses.",1358718815

However, there is a very fine line that Facebook is crossing.<p>Specifically, these sponsored posts are displayed in a way that causes confusion to the viewing user and, I am confident, this confusion is intentional on Facebook's part. As an apt web user with quite a bit of experience with Facebook and the web in general, I still get confused by these posts. I tend to assume they are posted by the friends that ""liked"" the brand and only in clearly questionable cases, such as when the post is about a bank, do I look close enough to realise it is sponsored content.<p>Intentionally causing confusion like this is shady, even if legal, and this ""feature"" of Facebook warrants as much attention as it is getting.<p>Ironically, this article is applying the same style of subtle confusion that it attacks (claiming that Facebook impersonates users when the author knows that's not technically accurate).

In this case, we did not adequately work with the advertiser to create a content program that was in line with our brand. In addition, because we had not fully thought through the issues around commenting on Sponsor Content, we made some mistakes trying to moderate the commenting thread. The general media climate also played a role here.<p>Once these issues came to light and I had the opportunity to assess the campaign, I made the decision to suspend it pending further review. To be clear, our decision to pull the campaign should not be interpreted as passing judgment on the advertiser as an organization. Where I believe we erred was in the execution of the campaign.<p>We then issued a statement to the press admitting we were at fault. When we make a mistake, we admit it. Our highest priority is The Atlantics reputation and credibility. Thats why so many readers trust us and why advertisers want to work with us.<p>Why did it happen?\nQuite simply, we did not have clearly established digital advertising guidelines and policies in place, and when youre innovating in a new territory without standardized guidelines (were not alone in the industry on this issue, by the way), mistakes can happen.<p>One important note for everyone: casting blame on any group or any individual is both unfair and simply not what we do at The Atlantic. And we most certainly should not speak to the press or use social media to attack our organization or our colleagues. We are a team that rises and falls together.<p>What is our plan going forward?\nWe are currently finalizing new policies and guidelines to govern advertising overall, with a specific focus on Sponsor Content.<p>Very shortly, well publish these new policies, and Ill be discussing them publicly with the press.<p>My hope is that well turn this issue into a moment where, as a leader in digital advertising, we will help move the industry to a better place.<p>The controversial Scientology sponsor content.<p>If you have ANY questions or potential concerns about something youre working on, please dont hesitate to push it up the chain. Push it up to meand if I think I need to, I will include Justin and David, not to mention Linda, Natalie, Bruce, Aretae (our new deputy general counsel), etc.<p>It seems fitting to quote one of our founders, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who once said Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. This isnt the first, nor the last time that WE will make mistakes, but what is important is how we handle them and what we learn from these moments. In this particular case, weve learned a number of important lessons. I am confident were going to walk away from this with a stronger team, a smarter business, and, ultimately, in a better position to continue producing the best journalism in the industry.<p>I am available at any time (including this weekend) should you wish to discuss any aspects of this week in further depth.<p>Have a good weekend.<p>Scott<p>M.

Rather, I think its an opportunity to discuss something thats fascinating and counterintuitive and that even researchers often get wrong.)<p>The original post says a researcher (Liam Hudson) was surprised to discover that average students seemed to be more creative than high-IQ students. Thus the question arises: <i>Does having a high IQ make you less creative?</i> The problem, however, is that the question is causal whereas the evidence that prompts it is observational and tricky for humans to interpret causally.<p>To see why its tricky, lets imagine a universe in which IQ and creativity are <i>completely unrelated</i>. Nevertheless, if both factors contribute to success (and its easy to believe that they do), they will have a negative correlation, <i>conditional upon success</i>. And guess what? Almost all creativity/IQ studies are implicitly conditioned upon success because researchers dont want to compare A students to C students, for fear of biasing their results.<p>For example, lets model our imaginary universe in R. First, lets assign normalized IQ and creativity scores to 100 students, completely randomly and completely independently:<p><pre><code>    n <- 100\n    creativity <- rnorm(n)\n    iq <- rnorm(n)\n</code></pre>\nAnd now lets say that success is some increasing (causal) function of creativity and IQ, plus chance:<p><pre><code>    success <- creativity + iq + rnorm(n)\n</code></pre>\nAnd now lets pretend that some researchers have captured this very data. <i>We</i> know that IQ and creativity are completely unrelated (because we created the universe), but <i>they</i> dont. Heres what happens when they try to tease out the relationship between IQ and creativity, conditioned upon success:<p><pre><code>    Call:\n    lm(formula = creativity ~ iq + success)\n\n    Coefficients:\n                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n    (Intercept) -0.08848    0.08042  -1.100    0.274    \n    iq          -0.58801    0.09394  -6.259 1.05e-08 ***\n    success      0.57538    0.05431  10.594  < 2e-16 ***\n    ---\n    Signif. codes:  0 *** 0.001 ** 0.01 * 0.05 . 0.1   1 \n</code></pre>\nNote that the IQ coefficient is negative. That is, given knowledge of a students success, if we also learn that the student has a higher IQ score, we should update our state of knowledge to <i>decrease</i> our belief that the student has a higher creativity score.<p>I know that that claim may sound counterintuitive, but if you do the probability math, youll see that it makes sense. It only <i>seems</i> counterintuitive. Thats because your brain cant help but try to interpret the relationship causally.<p>That is, its all too easy to take this relationship that exists between <i>states of knowledge</i> about the universe and think that it actually exists within universe for real. (This mistake is what E. T. Jaynes called the mind projection fallacy in his book <i>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science.</i>) And lots of researchers make this mistake, too.<p>I dont know for sure if thats whats happening here, in the IQ vs. creativity research, but it wouldnt surprise me to find that it has at least contributed to some of the unexpected findings.",1358717118

Meaning, a bailout isn't a good insurance policy for a shareholder because they lose anyway. But that fear of a bailout doesn't seem to limit the risk appetite as I'd expect.<p>I think it's because regulation and control hasn't made this type of risk transparent to the shareholder. The shareholder isn't calling for these types of regulations because of fear the regulation would be overbearing and hurt profitability.<p>Often, over regulation is a shortsighted concern that allows a company to take on more risk than an investor would typically allow for (at existing valuations).",1358717072

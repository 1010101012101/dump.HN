Most of the replies you've received are the kind of advice I wish I would have received at the time - with the same quantity and consistency.<p>Then again, I wouldn't have listened.  I was so certain that I was doing the right thing by ""following my passion"", when I was actually being a dumbkopf.  Don't be like me - don't be a dumbkopf.<p>1.) A CTO that can't write code in an early stage start-up is not a CTO.  Period.  We had a UI/UX/UXYZ ""expert"" that couldn't write a single line of HTML... in an early stage startup? - fail.<p>2.) Using personal feelings to make business decisions are a red flag.  It's funny that in the same paragraph you mention that they couldn't afford new talent.  This sounds like a textbook case of somebody being taken advantage of.  You are new to this business, they've sold you on their idea  but they can't sell the dream to other folks.  Doesn't sound good, my friend.  Sounds like pimping.<p>3.) If your leaving means death for the company, then you ARE the company and should own a LOT of the company.  Or should be paid market rates.  If they can't/won't pay market rates, then you should be a co-founder.  And you should own a LOT of the company.<p>4.) There will always be more opportunities.  Being the next Zuck or Google is the same thing as winning the lottery.  For the rest of us (back on planet earth), it's hard work and having good business sense.  There are no secrets.<p>Best of luck to you!  Keep everyone posted on what you decide.",1336906558

3966665,comment,3966187,3966358,8,0,cstross,,,"Minor nit: <i>the UK police, where -- with few exceptions -- the police does not carry guns at all</i><p>Firstly, some UK police forces are routinely armed -- the Nuclear Police and the Transport Police who patrol airports pretty much always carry automatic or semi-automatic weapons. (The first cop you see entering a British airport concourse will probably be carrying an MP5.)<p>Secondly, <i>all</i> UK police forces have specialist Armed Response Units, and all UK police have radios: if an armed incident is reported (including knives, not just guns and bombs), the armed units will turn up to handle them.<p>British police officers who carry guns are required to put in range time more than once a week and are trained specialists. Their usual tools are a Glock-17 and an H&K MP5, plus body armour, although specialist snipers are also on call.<p>So: while ordinary police patrols are ""unarmed"" (as in: they wear anti-stab vests and carry batons, pepper spray, and in some cases tasers -- just no firearms) any incidents that involve weapons will be responded to very rapidly by marksmen.<p>The policy difference is simply that British police forces treat firearms use as a speciality, and cops who carry guns need to be trained to a high level of proficiency. Given that the average American police officer draws and fires their gun in anger once in their career, if that, it follows that they're either under-trained or a huge amount of training is wasted on people who don't need it. The argument for arming them -- that it's a big country with a lot of violent armed criminals and specialist backup may not be available in time -- doesn't apply in the UK (small, dense country, very few firearms in private hands, relatively easy to summon armed specialists as needed).",1336906387

In the UK, and in general in much of historically protestant northern Europe, there is a very deeply ingrained culture where Bad Things will happen if you drink; the flip side of that is that if you do drink, it is much more socially acceptable to go out and get in a fight (after all, that's what you do when you're drunk, right?). In many Mediterranean cultures people do not consume significantly less alcohol (normally in the form of wine, of course), but people are generally more relaxed about this, and as a consequence there is less binge drinking and fewer drunken brawls.<p>Here is a report on this: <a href=""http://www.sirc.org/publik/drinking7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sirc.org/publik/drinking7.html</a>,  or, for a less technical explanation, see Kate Fox's <i>Watching the English</i>",1336906070

It's not even worth starting a campaign unless your whole site is being measured in every way possible.  Personally I'd recommend tailing the Apache logfiles in real time to start with, rather than relying on an analytics package.  You can move to analytics later once you've got the deep understanding from the logfiles.  Also, save those logfiles forever.<p>* Don't rely on Google's tools for choosing keywords etc.  They seem designed to waste your money (no surprise there!).  Instead, look at the natural and paid search terms people actually use -- by following those logfiles -- and generate your keywords and your <i>negative</i> keywords from there.  Be careful with broad-match keywords.  We tended to use exact match only.<p>* Don't use consultants, positioning tools etc.  At least, not to start with.

Usually there's just one obvious correct result among the 10, or it's just not there and your search is going to be a frustrating one because tweaking keywords to improve your results has become impossibly unintuitive with Google's recent ""I know what you <i>really</i> mean"" approach.<p>So that's another thing, as long as you know when you want to head straight for a tried-and-true reference (wikipedia, dictionary, HN search--I find DDG's !bang searches useful for these when I don't have them configured as shortcuts yet), not only does removing the top X sites give you fresh and new results, <i>also</i> your first page of results will be a varied palette out of the possible interpretations of your keywords (which you can use to refine), instead of a unity sausage (aka, a UNOX).",1336904644

And also use a bit of common sense from your side and ask yourself why you think this product will work in the market?. You are going to spend countless hours away from family, slogging on developing a state-of-the-art product which's going to be discarded in a couple of months/years time. Not a good way of investing precious time, which might have well been spent in academia.<p>I empathize with your situation.Long ago, I too, was stuck in a similar environment. The concept maker was undoubtedly brilliant but when it came to the software specs, he was at a complete loss. I was the only one in charge of development work. But gradually the product design changed and I kept on modifying my project every other day- changed the tools, changed the OS, shifted through multiple languages and finally setup my environment which worked well. By that time, I was half nuts. I struggled to get my work completed in time due to many technical issues, frequent changes in the original concept, and primarily because of lack of practicality of the project. I lost faith , I realized it was just going to be a test project and will be discarded in a couple of months time when they start working on the next long-term project. For them this was a low-priority project, but for me, it was everything and the only thing that mattered at that time. So I thought what the heck, I stayed put and tried to get as much work done as possible, worked like a dog, but my end product was not as impressive as they had imagined it to be. I didn't want to leave them, I loved my entire team and they are nice people. So, I continued being nice & tried to help them as much as I could. You know what, at the end, the entire project was scraped and forgotten as I expected and now they are focusing on a much bigger, profitable & 'practical' project. Guess who was blamed in the end and who got away?<p>If you want to help someone, they will never refuse. Being nice is easy, trust me. You want to be the nicest guy in the startup world, be the superhero in charge of saving your company from an predictable doom and maintain true friendship, I understand. But choose to continue what you are doing only if, you feel you cannot be more useful anywhere else in the world. God forbid, but suppose things go seriously wrong in your company tomorrow, the business people might put the blame on you, since you are the sole implementer.You mentioned that all of you are close friends..., but if they were in your shoes instead, what would they have done by now?<p>The toughest part is saying 'No'. It's painful for you, especially if your friends are on the receiving end of your rejection, but you need to do the right thing and save everyone's time including yours. Move on and help your friends move on too. Find another project or start a different company with your friends. Or if you have an alternate idea in mind, discuss the concept with them, don't just be a code monkey.",1336903854

We're the people who are actually trying to placate the population, yet you paint us as disingenuous, calculating, and shallow.  Even though we have NO other job than to placate the public after we mess up.  That's the ONE THING we do.  How can you be so offensive to us?""<p>Then the proper response would be ""Well, I'm very sorry if you are offended.  I do like companies to take genuine corrective action, and any company that has public relations employees who make true apologies out of regret for the hurt and other negative effects they have caused, especially if these people also have enough power and will within the organization to effect policies to ensure the company can't do such a thing in the future, is a company that I support.""<p>see, the nutjob was completely misreading you.

You care about them, but you stand by your actions.<p>In summary, I completely agree with you.  But given the number of nutjobs out there, sometimes a nutjob-placating response is appropriate.  Whenever I see nutjobs attacking a company for completely stupid reasons, I am glad to see this response trotted out.  In the present instance, like you, I am not happy to see it.<p><i>Also, if an intelligent person uses this formula with me, ""I'm sorry you feel this way"" it means that they are interested in my understanding and feelings, and interested in talking about why I feel this way, but feel that they are justified (without crossing their arms and lifting their chin about it).  This is very valuable feedback, and can open the dialogue to where either I or this person modifies their view.  It's a lot better than just shutting down or blindly apologizing!  No one should apologize 'genuinely' just to placate people, if they feel they did the right thing.  They should at least give the reasons for their actions.

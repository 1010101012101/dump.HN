We would not like to limit people to purely textual content, as it stands now you are able to include images in both questions and answers. Further to that, it would be hard to rate a person's recall based purely on whether they got the answer right (e.g. it could have been a random guess)<p>2. Could you elaborate on where you were failing to see the answers, because answers should definitely appear when studying.<p>3. Definitely something we can address, thanks for raising it.<p>4. The real gist of the application isn't in the electronic representation of flash cards, but the algorithm behind it that keeps track of how well you're recalling the answers and then let's you know when the best time is to study again. This studying methodology is known as spaced repetition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition</a>)<p>Again, thank you and everyone else who has taken the time to take a look and comment, your feedback and suggestions are all greatly appreciated.",1217541504

263502,comment,263017,263361,0,0,eugenejen,,,"Is there any existing MQ system that is decentralized? I said ""may works better"" because it is a conjecture limited by my ignorant mind. Internet is essentially decentralized. So if any MQ system can be modified to worked in decentralized environment. Then they may work better than XMPP. I believe the performance of throughput of those system may be higher than XMPP.<p>On the other hand. If I only have an internal cluster, I will choose to use existing MQ system instead of XMPP. I may want higher throughput, and I don't care authentication of endpoints because they are all trusted. Why do I need all the extra stuff that XMPP demands?<p>Regarding the case I mentioned in PubSub: It was just an idea. In fact, I was the one who mentioned the idea then. And our CTO and VP of Eng thought it was an interesting idea because in this case, we just wanted to see how does it work out and did a test implementation. And it was pretty flexible for us to use it.<p>Of course XMPP is not the first MQ system on Internet. SMTP is the first one, right? In SMTP, we don't know anything of endpoints. We assume senders and recipients exist and are taken care of by SMTP servers. I think in XMPP, because the original application is chatting, then it adds an new protocol to notify ""presence"" of endpoints.<p>Edit:
I think when I said ""internet scale"", I actually meant ""a system of billion nodes that are loosely coupled together""",1217540736

263487,comment,262570,262570,0,0,Spyckie,,,"These posts on email are fascinating.<p>I see 2 major divergences in email usage (or 3, actually).<p>1) a lot of people see email for personal use - as a TODO list, as a collection of your own information, etc. I think this constituent is made of of mostly males < 30 years of age.<p>2) a lot of people use email for conversation; ie, leaving messages to people where they know they will see it. Facebook is gaining ground on email because people feel more at ease gossiping through Facebook (which they associate with social activities) than email (dull, boring, practical). This constituent is probably the younger generation (< 22), and females.<p>3) the rest, which uses email casually or for business reasons. Email is just an open channel to talk or conduct business. The older generation uses it like this.<p>Email is difficult because people use it in so many ways that one interface for all the different uses of it fails to address specific needs. I think email needs to be sorted into categories that have their own user-interfaces that are optimal for that type of email (ie, email that is back and forth communication should look more like IM, an email that stores information should have the information distilled and be easily searchable, etc)",1217539857

263472,comment,263017,263459,0,0,briansmith,,,"OK, I want to mention one more thing.<p>Take any WS-<star> specification, and you can probably find one or more ad-hoc proposals for adding similar features for RESTful protocols. For example, AtomPub is adding a mechanism that is almost exactly like SOAP-with-attachments, but more limited. The various HTTP message signing mechanisms like those found in Amazon's web services or the one in OAuth (and OpenID? I forget if there is a different one for that) are analogous to the various WS-Security stuff. As another example, I've seen a couple RESTful protocols that tried to define something like a simpler WS-Policy.<p>I don't think that the WS-<star> stuff is that great either; a lot of it is really complex. But, WS-<star> stuff is all decomposed in ways that make it relatively simple to combine just the parts you need together. SOAP 1.2 isn't complicated at all. WS-Policy and WS-Security and other stuff is more complicated than it needs to be, but it isn't so complicated that it needs to be totally redone anew. And, a lot of it can be (and is) subsetted pretty easily.",1217538918

263467,comment,263300,263417,0,0,tstegart,,,"I think the idea as currently implemented would have low usage. Not that its not technically incredible, but I would put it into the category of a hobby site rather than a business. Its a fun thing to do, but people have many, many ways of finding different communities, and actually, its kind of fun to search through the different ones until you find something that fits you back. Are you a TechCrunch person, a YC person, a DIGG person? All of them? Its kind of an emotional thing to find a ""community."" In order to go from hobby site to business you'd need to get people to come back repeatedly, and searching for a new community just isn't something a person does often. The numbers for a business just aren't there.<p>However, with any problems, there are always ideas for solutions. For example, if you really did want to turn this into a business, you'd have to solve the problems above. Find people who would search for related communities often, and who want to do it quickly and with good results.<p>I think one idea would be to focus on your notion of promoting something. The people who do this for a job are PR or media placement people. They might need this sort of thing. When they have a client that wants to get the word out, or wants to advertise to their audience, one important consideration for a P.R. or media placement person usually is"" ""well, where can we find their audience?"" A company might tell them, ""well, this is where we usually go to tell people what our new product is."" And a P.R. person could use your site and say ""have you tried X, Y, or Z too?""<p>So thats just an idea. Obviously, tuning the site to P.R. people and seeing if it makes sense is a lot of work, but thats really what separates a business from a hobby. This is exactly where you run into the classic hacker's dilemma (ok, its not classic, but it sounded like a nice phrase): turning your mad coding skills into something that people actually want. It can be a coding marvel, but until people actually want it, its not a business.<p>It sounds like you have the skills down, you just need an idea. Apparently, around here they're a dime a dozen, so if you're here to build a business, your execution skills will come in handy.",1217538615

263459,comment,263017,263383,0,0,briansmith,,,"It is pretty common for a RESTful protocol to end up with batch-fetching and batch-updating operations. Once you add those operations, you've already violated the ""uniform interface"" constraint and removed all the benefits (primarily caching, authentication, authorization, and parallelism) that derive from the uniform interface constraint. Once you have batch-fetch and batch-update, those two operations can generally do everything that you usually did via individual PUT/POST/DELETE operations. So, why do you need the separate PUT/POST/DELETE operations at all? It is just more surface area for you to maintain.<p>Now, maybe you want to combine your batch-update and batch-fetch operations into a single ""batch-update-and-fetch"" POST operation. Well, that is exactly what WS-* does.<p>On the flip side, sometimes instead of batching you want to fetch or update only parts of individual resources via some extension to partial GET requests and or a PATCH method. There is currently no uniform interface for those so, just like in the case of batching, you lose all the uniform-interface benefits.<p>Now, let's say you want to combine your partial-resource operations with batch operations over multiple resources to reduce the number of requests you receive and/or the reduce the aggregate size of requests, so you add the ability to do patching and partial-fetches to your batch-update-and-fetch mechanism.<p>Now take a step back. Doesn't your batch-update-and-fetch-with-patch-and-partial-fetch look a lot like SOAP with WS-ResourceTransfer? It will probably look a lot like SOAP; not even the newish SOAP 1.2 that actually is somewhat HTTP cache friendly, but old school RPC-only SOAP + WS-ResourceTransfer.<p>Look at Google's GData and OpenSocial's RESTful API for examples.<p>And, that is totally ignoring anything to do with transactions.",1217538020

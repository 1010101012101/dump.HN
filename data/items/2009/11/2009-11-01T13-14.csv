915045,comment,913395,913520,0,0,jsz0,,,"Android being an open source project negates most of the scary anti-competitive possibilities. A handset maker could ship an Android device that was completely independent of Google services. It's a fair playing field for Google's competitors. If Microsoft wanted to they goto a handset maker like HTC and offer the same revenue sharing model via Bing and other Microsoft services bundled with an Android handset. Inversely you could build a handset not running Android and still use Google services on your own OS. If Microsoft had adopted a similar level of openness and equal access they could have saved themselves a lot of trouble and probably got the same exact results in the end. IE was a better browser than Netscape at this time. It would have won on its own technical merits. ActiveX and these other Microsoft proprietary schemes failed on their own merits despite IE having enormous browser market share. Even with IE being bundled on Windows it hasn't stopped Firefox and WebKit based browsers from growing in popularity. Microsoft gained nothing from their anti-competitive moves. I don't think Google will repeat the same mistake.",1257083684

As you travel down the tree away from the root, you become increasingly isolated from other branches of the tree, and you can't even talk to distant leaf nodes because you lack the same vocabulary and shared set of theorems.<p>Yes, we share some parent way up the tree, but we can't go all the way back to that as a starting point because it'd simply take too long to progress from there back down to the interesting leaf node.<p>This vision makes me wonder when mathematics will reach a point where mastering the material required to understand a leaf node will take greater than the average life span.",1257083358

The result is I need good spam filtering.<p>My filtering now achieves around 99.6% filtering, and about 1 detected false positive per month.

And they left a lot of things untouched, which is inexcusable for a company with their resources (sure it's a fresh coat of paint; but dig down just a little, and you can <i>still</i> find horrible, awkward interfaces that were untouched since 1995).<p>My friend bought 7 Pro for his extremely fast PC built in the last couple of years.  But within hours he decided to remove it (back to XP) and wait until he buys a new PC.  I'm sure the hardware businesses love that, but what kind of value is that for a multi-hundred-dollar OS?",1257083248
915036,comment,914878,915033,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"The author suggests that using a form makes the problem go away.  My experience says that people who can't de-obfuscate an email address frequently can't type their return address correctly.  The obfuscated address gives them feedback in the form of a bounced email, and thereby gives a recovery mode.  The incorrect return address in the form gives no recovery mode at all.<p>To me, that's conclusive proof that the form is worse than the obfuscated address.<p>Further, there's a balance to be achieved.  I've analysed the types of people I want to contact me, and of those who can't work out my address there are two types.  One type is those that I really don't care about - nuisance, spam, content-free, or time-wasters.  The others that I do care about usually have a different route to me, one that's specifically tailored to them and made as easy as possible.  That one has a specially designed anti-spam measure built into it.",1257083185
915035,comment,914878,914878,0,0,NathanKP,,,"The two main suggestions to allow people to contact you without getting lots of spam:<p>1) Use Gmail.  Google has written their search engine to know how to detect spam so they know how to stop spam from reaching your email address.  I don't think I have ever had even a single spam message even reach my spam folder, and that's thanks to Google.  I could put my non-obfuscated email address all over the place and not have to worry.<p>2) Write a custom contact form.  It is not that hard if you know even a little bit of PHP.  And if you don't you can always use Zoho forms or some other free online form creator.  I never put up contact emails because they are, in my opinion, just as unprofessional as an obfuscated contact email.  Contact forms are much more professional.",1257082946

So I ask HN, do any of you use such things?Can anyone give me good links to other open audio courses.<p>My interests are mainly in electronics and mathematics.",1257081898

In that case I was toying with getting the subscription anyway (and I still have it 8 months later and am very happy I took the plunge).<p>However I do think that was a lucky experience; I saw something I wanted to try out, got it and got a freebie in the process. Win win.<p>I liked the follow up Techcrunch post where the Hot or Not guy is quoted as saying that the idea isnt in itself a bad one (affiliate sign ups) - just that the industry has slid the wrong way. Im sure he's correct; It worked for me and it can work for others too.

And not from the Internet, from mentors and books.<p>3) Writing -- post stuff on your blog that helps other people and makes you look smart. Maybe even write a book or two depending on whether your interests are conducive to that.<p>4) Networking -- Know at least 500 people in each of the major US cities where your business operates. Know at least 6 superconnectors in each city who you can ask for help if you need it. Know at least 2,000 people total.",1257081344

915020,comment,913931,913931,0,0,Mz,,,"Of course, I dislike being downvoted.  If I think it was because I was misunderstood or misinterpreted, I will post in response to the downvote.  Clarification sometimes gets the original post upvoted, as well as the clarification.  If it's a case of ""Yeah, I was trying to avoid getting into that because I just knew it would go over badly and now I've been downvoted, confirming what I thought"" or a case of me just not saying something well because I was having a bad day, I generally leave it alone.  No point in pouring gasoline on the fire, so to speak (which is generally what's going to happen if I am already sticking my feet in my mouth because I don't feel well and now I am all defensive and trying to ""clarify""....downward spiral ensues).<p>On the one hand, I often do wish people would converse with me and tell me what they ""heard"" that they think it's a bad comment.  In many cases, it turns out be a misunderstanding. The vast majority of meaning in face-to-face communication comes from facial expression, body language, voice tone and context.  The actual words are a very small part of the meaning conveyed.  But on the 'Net, the words are about all we have.  If two people come from very different backgrounds, misunderstandings are practically guaranteed.<p>On the other hand, an Iranian friend once told me that there is a saying in Iran:  ""Silence is the only good answer to stupid people.""  I would modify that slightly to ""Silence is the only good answer to something stupid.""  We all do stupid stuff at times.  It isn't proof we are generally stupid. It's just part of the human condition.  An anonymous downvote, though it may be upsetting to the receiver, is probably a lot less destructive to the community than being able to put a name to the criticism and having to try to express the criticism in words.  Running battles between two members who just don't ever agree on anything can be very destructive to a forum. I think the capacity to downvote helps avoid such outcomes.<p>I am still getting a feel for how HN works.  But so far I am finding that the system here seems to do a better job of minimizing some of the negative social crapola you find everywhere.  Conflict of interest will never go away.  Interpersonal friction between some members is inevitable.  Spammers and all kinds of other undesirable stuff is also a fact of life.  There has to be a means to address that.  Warm-fuzzy 'let's only upvote people' solutions won't work.  It has no teeth.",1257081168

By the time I finished grad school (in computer science), I already had years of experience on my resume from full time employees and short term contracts.  It's my solid work experience that got me my current position after graduation, not my MS in CS.<p>I don't expect the entitled American youth to sacrifice like that though.  Now I understand why H1's are so popular, they have experience, work them to death for less pay, and the joy of not dealing with entitled American youth.<p>Even outside of tech, for example in the medical field, hospitals are paying for massive amounts of SE Asians to move here for nursing positions.

I got my first job because while I was unemployed, I spent my time learning my way around Linux and Perl (this was in 1997) until I had enough experience to be employable at the relatively low rate I was more than happy to accept (and which subsequently went up pretty quickly when I proved myself).<p>My wife, on the other hand, has a doctorate in biochemistry.  While she might get a little mileage out of writing a blog were she unemployed, the advantages would probably be minor compared to the disadvantage of being out of touch with a laboratory and not able to read expensive scientific publications.<p>Point being, I think that sometimes we forget just how easy it is to get involved with stuff in the tech world.  With an internet connection, a $500 laptop, free tools and mostly free documentation, you can do world-class work, and communicate with pretty much anyone you want to about most anything.

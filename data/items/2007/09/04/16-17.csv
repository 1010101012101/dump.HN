He's talking about a system where it really feels like the person is there.  The attributes of life size-ness (sp) and eye contact make the difference.<p>I don't think people will want this to replace telephone calls, rather to hold business meetings.  A Thanksgiving dinner would be pretty cool too.  So it feels like everyone is at the same table.",1188924639

""The way the music died"" - this was a PBS show about the decline of the music industry.  One theory advanced is that as lawyers and accountants (without much real interest in music) took over the studios, the product suffered.  It took a while, but eventually, that caught up with the industry.  <p>2. A salon.com article titled: ""the greatest week in rock in history"" - about a week that a truly remarkable line-up of top-selling albums.  It's amazing that this much talent was compressed into the same moment in history.<p>Anyway, the reason I dig reading about this is that it is a cautionary tale for the technology industry.  It's very tempting to put suits in charge of software, but in the end, it tends to fail.  <p>The main difference: the music industry had such a good catalog of existing product (a led zeppelin album is still good to listen to today) that they could limp along without innovating for quite some time.  Whereas most software companies that stop innovating will be dead quickly.  Yeah, monopoly positions can hold reality at bay for a while, but reality always wins in the end.",1188923909

50014,comment,50002,50002,0,0,alex_c,,,"Sure. And we'll have cold fusion by 2010, and a man on Mars by 2012.<p>Fiber-to-the-home has been promised for over 10 years.  It may be getting closer, but widespread availability by next year?  I doubt it.<p>But the biggest problem is that no one actually WANTS a videoconferencing unit in their home.  The technology's been around for decades; ok, maybe not a high-res large screen TV, but a 5"" screen over POTS.  To put it simply, people don't want to have to dress up and do their hair just to place a phone call (and what do you do if someone calls when you're in your PJs?)<p>The only real application at home are long-distance calls with family members or friends who live far.  This works okay with webcams, and I can't see enough demand to buy large-screen video-conferencing units for this purpose to make it a killer app.",1188921990

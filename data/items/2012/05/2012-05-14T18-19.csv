That way, they get extremely high quality illustration skills for an extremely low price.<p>I hope that situation will change soon children oriented iPad apps are taking off, and high quality illustrations have a big role to play in that I think parents appreciate the value in a finely drawn story. But yet illustrators are still very much underpaid, especially in contrast to the developers of these apps.",1337021988

3972595,comment,3971693,3971808,2,0,its_so_on,,,"I might not be popular here for saying so, but I have to get this off my chest.  I think it is a pretty great move by the FTC to make it outright fraud to shill, and I'll tell you why I think so.  Please indulge me a little.<p>The reason is that information doesn't generate itself.  If you Google <i>BlackHole5000 coffee extruder review</i>, the BlackHole5000 coffee extruder being this great industrial high-pressure coffee maker, and you don't find a single review, that means in a way there is this 'commons' that is empty now.  If there is no Wikipedia article on it (maybe there shouldn't be) there is also an empty 'commons' there.  Now compare this with a Wikipedia article being there and being informative: (say the BlackHole5000 is extremely notable, as destiny would have in 20 years) if someone were to completely blank that page out or vandalize it beyond usability, then until this issue is rectified it's pretty clear that they have taken someone from a 'common good.'<p>Now my argument is that if people take the time to post their review of the BlackHole5000, for me to find, that is also kind of a public good.  (After all, they're free to browse if you can find them, etc.)  If Google and <i>every</i> search engine were to be completely buried in SEO spam, such that the legitimate reviews are <i>impossible</i> to find, no matter what, by anyone, then it's pretty clear the public loses something.  It's like air that you can't breath anymore because it has too much pollution in it.  A lake can literally be too toxic for anyone to camp by it, even if it doesn't belong to anyone.<p>Now what may irk some people here even more.  What if we don't completely bury the legitimate reviews, but only adulterate them with paid shills?  Before I get to this, let's take a simpler example of attacking a public scientist or activist's message by 'poisoning the well' (attacking their credibility in a false and underhanded way, just to keep the audience from appreciating the message.)  In my world-view, there are whole fields and areas of human endeavor which have NO credible scientists and are ALL opinion.  To me, the freely available opinions of credible researchers who have invested months or years into understanding to tell me about it is also a kind of 'public good.'  There is no reason anyone has to lie to me about how photosynthesis works, and YET it is part of the public good that I can do a google search and immediately get to credible opinion on it.  Luckily, photosynthesis is one of the few areas of humanity where there is simple, credible agreement.<p>If someone were to add a bunch of 'poisoning the well' type junk, then photosynthesis would be like the effects of smoking on the human body, would be like the causes of automobile accidents, would be like labor conditions in China, would like a million different subjects that just have opinions on them but no real credible consensus for anyone who searches.  We should cherish credibility and it should be a crime to knowingly ""poison the well"" in my humble opinion.<p>Now we return to what I was saying about paid product reviews.  In this case, genuine customer satisfaction is also a kind of ""public good"" -- if you dilute it, it disappears, and if you dilute it enough no one reasonable would ever search for ""BlackHole5000 review"", since the result is as good as guessing: no relationship with customer experience.<p>But if it becomes ILLEGAL to dilute it in this way, and these laws work, then something magical can happen.  Suddenly, if people know that googling for reviews 'works', then if the BlackHole5000 is off the charts, then anyone who is curious enough to try the Google search will see this, try the BlackHole5000 and within a few years it is a cult icon that truly deserves a Wikipedia article.  Which never would have happened if customers knew that searching for reviews online was useless.<p>Basically, if we want to live in a world where better products win, then I think we should cherish the 'public good' that is customer opinion on that product.  The most obvious objection about free speech already doesn't apply to being able to say whatever you want to sell your product (e.g. 'the BlackHole5000 cures cancer our studies find', without any mention of the FDA) so why should you be able to pay others to talk about your product as though they weren't paid?<p>Basically, it's hard enough to get people to put up a genuine review that is useful, period.  (It takes work and thought).  We should cherish the few results, when they happen.",1337021969

There are automated solutions for all this stuff that makes it very easy. No shipping company in their right mind would change their workflow to make it easier to a ""home"" user.

What confuses me most is that once you search for documentation, the snippet part of the app completely disappears.<p>Personally I wouldn't have put in the snippet part.

The truth is, my company would be happy to pay out 10% of any order if it resulted from a genuine recommendation. Of course anyone experienced with the affiliate world can figure out a way to capture that money, but it's not really available to your everyday Facebook user. Maybe Refer.ly will fix that. Using Viglink is smart.<p>Unfortunately, the ecommerce company for which I work has had to completely abandoned affiliate marketing. Almost all of our affiliate fees were going to scammers who were using Google Adwords and bidding on our brand terms. Of course that was against our policy, but we had no way of stopping them out of the gate. They would even copy our exact ad so that when we searched our own name, it would appear at a glance that it was in fact our ad showing up (same display URL and everything). Eventually we just had to shut the whole thing down. I hope Refer.ly can figure out a way to avoid these scammers. I imagine it will be difficult.<p>With this business model, I wonder if it's possible to act as an aggregator for the Amazon affiliate system? Amazon pays out a higher percentage based on how much volume you bring in. If Refer.ly acted as a single affiliate with Amazon, but they in turn paid out affiliates to thousands of different Refer.ly users, then each user would then be getting the highest possible affiliate percentage from Amazon, right? Because together they would qualify for the volume bonus. I haven't looked into it, but I'm guessing Amazon must have some rule against this.",1337020569

I don't have any particular knowledge in this area, but intuitively, it's too shady to be legal -- it's like taking out embarrassing ads in your competitor's name or something. Not a normal part of business competition. (A good rule of thumb -- if it were legal, would people be doing it?) Maybe you could even get to trademark infringement, if you argued that the bogus links are a false claim that the company itself is doing something it isn't doing -- like if I distributed swastikas with my competitor's logo and phone number on them, I can imagine that being some kind of trademark tort.<p>That doesn't mean you can prove it.

However, the characteristics of an <i>average</i> student can be vastly different between a top-tier university and those lower in the rankings.<p>These sorts of requirements aren't put in place because there are particular skills necessary to do the job. They are in place to cut down the applicant pool to a reasonable size while raising the average quality (or at least not lowering it). It's classic signaling.<p>They let the university do most of the screening for them, weeding out the people who aren't smart, driven and dedicated enough to get into and graduate from a top-tier school.<p>Some extremely prestigious consulting firms won't look at a resume that isn't from one of a handful of schools.

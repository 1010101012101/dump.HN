640204,comment,639997,640105,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's funny because Palm has actually been saying that corporate customers shouldn't be buying the Pre - that they should be getting one of the Treo models instead.<p>I don't think the Pre is really an enterprise device.  It just isn't boring enough ;-).  Really, it's that it has untested support for things like Exchange (other than Palm's internal testing).  I'm sure businesses will support it just as they've started to support the iPhone, but even Palm is saying that enterprise customers should go with a different device (at least for now).<p>What makes you think it has a corporate angle?  Specific features?  The way it's being marketed?  The real keyboard?  I'm curious since it's not how I see the device, but when I see the device I think about what I'd do with it as a consumer.  It would be really cool if Palm carved out a chunk of that market.",1244055467

It makes it possible to phrase the P vs. NP question much more starkly.<p>The standard formulation of P vs. NP is something like ""do deterministic polynomial-time Turning machines have the same power as nondeterministic polynomial-time Turing machines?""  A deep question, but not a very snappy sentence.<p>But the alternate formulation is something like:  ""is it always as easy to find a correct answer as it is to check if a given answer is correct?""  Really brings home why it seems so painfully obvious that P is not equal to NP (of <i>course</i> it's easier to check an answer than to find one), and makes it seem that much more profoundly strange that we haven't found a way to prove this.",1244055360

640192,comment,639571,639571,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"A few things left out of this still-good article, which take the blame off Enterprise Software Companies (somewhat):<p>1. Google runs its own servers, and has been quietly building a cloud. ESCs have traditionally installed their systems on corporate networks by necessity. It would probably not be easy for Google to offer 'Wave in a Box' and stick on shelves at Office Depot, or come in, install it, and then walk away. If I had suggested to a corporate client in the 90s that they put their mission-critical enterprise software on an IBM or MS server somewhere in Montana they'd have asked what I was smoking.<p>My current non-tech boss still wants everything emailed as a Word document because he 'owns' MS office and the hardware it sits on. He simply doesn't get the concept of Google Docs and is hostile to the idea of not knowing 'where his files are'. Because it's free, in his mind that means it lacks value.<p>2. Enterprises are about work. Wave is innovative, but as with many other net things, 3rd party innovation will play a key role - and the 3rd party innovation comes from people playing with freely accessible tools, and re-purposing them in unforeseen ways. Now if you work at MegaCorp and you've just installed Softosaurus across your enterprise, with all the huge deployment and training costs, the last thing you are going to do is say 'play around with it - it's OK if it breaks, as long as it does so in an interesting way'.<p>If you find a way to set up Notes such that it allows you to play Tetris, this is more likely to get you fired than to earn you a personal espresso machine and a pat on the back. Innovation within the enterprise is disruptive of the enterprise's goals, and looked on with extreme suspicion. When I was still working for multinationals, I got disciplined more than once for over-customising my workstation because my increase in productivity came at the expense of the standard build...<p>3. and violating the standard build is an intensely political act, because it implies that someone in a decision making role was wrong. This is client-side politics: deviating from the decisions of the IT strategists is looked on as hostility to their goals, and thus towards those of the organization. Of course, when I was in tech support I regularly moaned about users who wouldn't do what was good for them, so I'm guilty too.<p>The bottom line is that enterprise clients do not reward experimentation or innovation until they see the resulting productivity elsewhere. Curiosity is not a valuable trait, what they want is focus and diligence. You can't really blame enterprise suppliers for choosing to cater to this primary demand of their customers.",1244054930

Statistical significance of sub-samples can plummet quickly.<p>If I'm marketing a product specifically to, say, 30-44yo men, it would be valuable to restrict the sample exclusively to those men and I think i'd have a better chance of seeing statistical meaning in the sub-samples I'm looking for, eg, income, marital status, etc.<p>It seems to me now that I'd have to post it ""at large"" and the 30-44yo demo I'm looking for would itself be a sub-sample.<p>I am not a marketing professional, but as a small business owner its one of my many hats.

Its caching architecture is laughably bad, and the implementation was/is buggy (again, we rolled our own), and there's next to no support for the kind of robust page cache expiration mechanisms that are necessary to run a large, dynamic site (Observers are only a start).  Rails is a memory hog, takes too long to start, has poor translation and locale support, and simply passing a request through ActionController adds huge overhead that cannot be escaped.<p>And even though you don't want to hear it, Ruby <i>is</i> slow -- even after working around all of the above, we still had to implement a fast page caching layer just to work around the general, all-purpose slowness of Ruby.<p>But like I said, write me off if you want.",1244052946

Nothing beats using a dumb programming language and process model, and without explicitly deciding anything, being able to scale past physical memory until your working set just barely fits.<p>Further, there may be some performance benefit to swapping idle process memory to make room for more buffer cache.<p>It's true that for interactive use (especially a laptop with spun-down drives), you may be happy without swap.  But I don't see the facility being mothballed.",1244052934

640126,comment,639874,639874,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It really is a pity. The Commodore PET was the first computer I got to use at high school, and 2 years later I persuaded my parents to buy a Vic-20 (though with hindsight, I should have asked for the Spectrum, which would have made me a better programmer). The C64 and 128 were very good for their time, and the Amiga (bought by Commodore in 1985) still has many fans; for a while it was <i>the</i> affordable option for 3d graphics and video mixing.<p>It's still a bit of a mystery to me why Commodore failed to crack the business market with it. Maybe their success in the home computer space diminished the brand in the eyes of potential buyers, or maybe it was because Commodore's board decided to focus on profit-taking after ejecting Jack Tramiel, and failed to dominate against the Atari ST (which was what JT sold next after getting the boot from his own company).<p>Excuse the run-on nostalgia. When I was a teen, Jack Tramiel was a hero of mine, and he enjoyed the same kind of status that Bill Gates or Steve Jobs has - a ruthless businessman whose recipe for success was making technology affordable and accessible. Back when computers seemed like exotic and opaque toys (I grew up in Ireland, so in the 80s the computer revolution was just beginning), Jack Tramiel was pushing out fun and affordable machines, but they and he looked respectable enough to be part of the 'sell' to skeptical parents - 'the company is called Commodore <i>Business</i> Machines, Dad! It's not just for games, I'll have a career!' I knew little or nothing of business, but I knew Tramiel was a businessman who listened to his engineers and his customers, and that meant a lot to a young geek. He was really ahead of his time.",1244052458

5295963,comment,5294202,5294483,1,0,will_brown,,,"As the article mentions, but not by name, the US has a similar rule typically called ""prevailing party fees"".  The article also mentions in the US the prevailing party fees must be triggered by statute or a provision of a contract - but fails to mention this is done quite frequently, in fact so much so that I would say while each party bearing its own fees is the rule in the US by default, but the exceptions (prevailing party fee triggered by statute or contract) are used more generally than the default.<p>Aside from common law vs civil law, Europe and the US have fundamentally different legal systems (adversarial vs non-adversarial).  I think the non-adversarial system supports the English Rule, while the US adversarial system unnecessarily drives up attorneys fees and costs so legislators authorize attorneys fees only in specific types of cases where it is justified, and of course where a provision is included in a contact (of course parties in the US have the ability to contract such provisions).",1362009590

Or how about just avoiding the revolts in the first place by having a decent moral government that evens the playing field between rich and poor?<p>> It's actually just a return to earlier ideas of American government that served us well at the time.<p>This is BS rosy-tinted glasses revisionism that has no grounding in real history. Like how everything was better in the 50s if you just ignored segregation and the 90% tax rate we had on the rich. Did isolationalism serve us well before WWI and II? Did our hands off approach prevent the dishonest greed and speculation that led to the depression? The 1800s weren't that much better, just look at all the crashes and war that went on then.<p>> To be clear, I'm not a libertarian, for reasons that aren't relevant here.<p>Good, because libertarians tend to be bad historians and have a poor understanding of human nature.",1362009566

It became a major issue because women joined the workforce without having their different needs met. Having daddy go to work and having both mommy and daddy go to work are two completely different things.<p>If women were solely homemakers like the old days, I doubt the issue would ever come up at all. Perhaps if women were still homemakers, but single dads and gay couples became a huge chunk of the workforce.<p>It doesn't mean that particular law can't benefit other groups too, but it's practically only a issue because women stopped being ""just homemakers"" (or if you're from my country, ""domestic women"").<p>So the group we are talking about here doesn't necessarily have to be women, but historically, that's who it was.",1362009543

5295941,comment,5291817,5294747,4,0,fusiongyro,,,"> I don't understand what lambda calculus is that functional programming isn't or vice versa.<p>It's a bit like wondering what part of procedural programming is using a turing machine and which part isn't. :) The theory is theory and the practice is practice; in the end, what you're using is pretty far from it but it retains some of the flavor.<p>The flavor of lambda calculus is one of substitution and reduction. Expressions are evaluated, values replaced, variables bound. Even something like Scheme is pretty far from it, but it is close enough that if you want to study one the other will help.<p>The basic lambda calculus you hear about is usually the original untyped lambda calculus. The typed lambda calculus isn't much more worse, but bears a stronger resemblance to ML and so forth.<p>I have not found the absence of a background in lambda calculus to be much of an impediment to learning and applying functional programming. Presence of the word ""calculus"" tends to make us think something is grand and mystifying. In this particular case my impression is that it is an interesting theoretical diversion and that's about all one needs to know.<p>> I thought I saw that Erlang is influenced by some concepts from that<p>Well... Erlang was originally implemented <i>in</i> Prolog. And the syntax borrows from Prolog in many places. However, Erlang is absolutely <i>not</i> a logic programming language because there is no unification happening within it. It is really cool in its own right though.<p>The world of logic programming continues to be dominated by Prolog, which is an amazing, somewhat practical and beautiful language, but also warty old hog at the same time. Mercury gets brought up from time to time, and it should be amazing, but lacking a repl it leaves me cold. Apart from these two there are a handful of multiparadigm languages that have some constraint handling, such as Oz or one of the embedded Prologs for Lisp (Allegro has a good one), and then there's things like CLIPS or Jess or JBoss Drools, but for dedicated logic languages it's still essentially just Prolog.<p>I'm a huge fan of Prolog, by the way! I don't think it helps much with learning functional programming but it definitely will blow your mind, and probably more than FP would too. If you wind up trying it out and getting stuck, drop me a line or ask a question on SO. I frequently leave huge answers there and the community is very friendly.",1362009307

Otherwise they're facing double-spend scams and things like that. Fear, uncertainty, and doubt aren't bullshit, but it's cute that you deflect a real argument with an acronym.<p>There won't be a time where any intelligent person would have all their holdings in Bitcoin, because it is nothing more than a proposal that got out of hand. The guy who came up with it even said it'd be stupid for someone to use it like a real currency. Furthermore there will still be transaction fees, since those are what's planned to support the network operators after coins are mined.<p>Regarding chargebacks, having a currency forbid them is not the appropriate answer to fraud that involves them. No consumer would have any faith in the system without some basic protection in case their stuff gets stolen. For all the problems caused by banks, it sure is nice to have someone who is regulated provide some kind of security in case I lose my wallet.<p>So there you have it. Bitcoins are bad for merchants, as well as consumers.<p>Edit: I love the quip about how a bad merchant's reputation will suffer. That doesn't work.

The author definitely knows a lot about hadoop, yet displays a misunderstanding of such a basic piece of it (conflating hadoop with map-reduce).<p>Just a few key things I can refute:<p>Hadoop as wasteful: production systems are built to withstand the expected peaks of traffic (i.e., some website that sees a huge influx when the east coast wakes up on monday morning will design with that load+buffer in mind), which means that ~90% (probably even higher!) of the time resources are underutilized.  even personally my own laptop isn't chugging at 100% on all cores all day every day, I don't see how anybody expects any collection of computers to do so.  On the flip side, this is being offset by platforms like AWS.  When I run map-reduce jobs on hadoop, I spin up an EMR jobflow, run a few tasks and then shut it down.  Presumably, somebody else gets to use those machines after I'm done.<p>Lack of third party support: Honestly, with mrjob and EMR, I've never needed to deal with any hadoop management, setup, maintenance or scaling.  Also, all my code is python, I've not had to write a line of Java.  And these aren't the only tools built on top of hadoop.<p>Hadoop as deprecated: there are certainly more big-data crunching platforms coming out nowadays, but hadoop is mature, stable, and still going strong.  Also, the basic map-reduce framework it's based on is not going anywhere soon.  I mean, I cut my teeth on map-reduce with mongodb, and it seems most other nosql solutions there are going that route for complicated things their standard query engine can't support.",1362007249

If you want to extract data out of e.g. web-pages Hadoop is a great tool as it abstracts away the problems of distributing the algorithm and the data for you.

If you have 5 terabyte of click data from your website and you want to cluster and analyze this data Hadoop (or better Hbase) can help you to solve this problem.<p>It is a different paradigm.

The employee accounts and admissions Pincus made regarding doing anything to make money just added insult to injury. Additionally, I don't think there's anything worth balancing regarding a CEO who tells his employees to steal rather than innovate because they're not as smart as their competitors.<p>The OP used the term ""groomed"" to speak to how many young employees were quickly shot up the ranks without any experience and how this was intentional. I would be grateful to someone that irresponsibly gave me a fancy title and put me in charge of something too, despite the reality that he was using my youthful ambitions to his advantage, working me to the bone under the guise that I was capable of the work I was doing, despite failing in doing so. I also don't know anything about the author's health before the incident where he collapsed, but it wouldn't surprise me if the stress of working in such a way played a role in it.

The second entry was a few sentences about how ideas are useless (when actually dreamers are just as important as doers, but I guess when you can make money profiting off of other people's ideas, you would hold this sentiment). Outside of the linked entry, the rest were just a few sentences to a paragraph or two on nothing all that earth-shattering.<p>Personally, I think they should put the answers the authors write in response to the ""Expertise + Authority: Who are you?

In fact, given the complexity of business mergers, sales, taxes, etc., it sounds like it would result in an ever expanding nest of exemptions.<p>What does it have anything to do with taxes or any of that other stuff? If you have two corporate entities that merge, the merged entity can be considered the original assignee of all of the patents that each of the merging entities was. It's not a complicated rule. But it keeps trolls from setting up ""mergers"" to falsify their status as an ""inventor or original assignee,"" because it's all or nothing. You couldn't transfer any subset of the selling entity's original patents to anyone else and still call them original patents.<p>Here, we can make it even more simple. Forget about mergers. You can transfer a patent for which you are the inventor or original assignee to another party and have that party be considered the original assignee if and only if you transfer every such patent you own to that party.<p>>There's nothing wrong with companies that buy IP and do nothing but licence it; that's how an efficient market in IP is likely to operate.<p>So say the patent trolls. It reminds me of what the high frequency traders say about liquidity: Even if it could theoretically be true under some set of artificial constraints, in practice the cost of allowing it pretty clearly exceeds the supposed efficiency benefits.<p>>The problem is with the frivolousness/obviousness of the original patents.<p>The problem is that software patents anyone is likely to infringe are inherently frivolous/obvious, because the lack of physical constraints causes there to be a million good ways to do any given thing in software, so (putting aside standards-essential patents that constitute their own special brand of unintended consequences), the only way you get a software patent that anyone else will ever infringe is to abstract the so-called invention out so far that it covers all plausible implementations rather than only the specific one that you're supposed to have invented.<p>The patent system wasn't designed for software. They're not compatible with one another. The proper solution is to eliminate software patents. But if we can't do that today then putting as many sensible limits on the amount of economic damage they can cause in the meantime will have to suffice.",1362006533

We are not talking about a startup that outprices Amazon by actually doing something technically superior to cut costs, we are talking about a startup that is trying to use a loss leader strategy.  Nothing to see here, it's a well known tactic.<p>""Most Bitcoin Processors give confirmation fairly quickly. The customer doesn't have to wait 10 minutes.""<p>Last I checked, it was 10-30 minutes.  More importantly, isn't using a payment processor defeating the whole point here?  What advantage does Amazon get from using a BTC payment processor over Visa?  Were we trying to avoid convincing Visa to become a Bitcoin processor?<p>""Taxes shouldn't be too big of an issue. They just get reported like accepting any other foreign currency.""<p>Bitcoin is not a foreign currency.  In all likelihood, Amazon would have to report taxes on BTC transactions as if they were barter transactions, which basically means reporting the dollar value of the goods being sold.  That means that either Amazon has to adjust the prices of goods on a day-by-day basis to account for Bitcoin prices, or take the risk that they will wind up losing money as Bitcoin fluctuates (and without a futures market on Bitcoin, there are few ways to mitigate that risk, except the immediately convert the BTC they receive back into dollars -- so again, why bother with the extra complication?).<p>As for lines of credit, the point is this:  issuing a loan in a deflationary currency is a massively bad idea.  Deflation makes loans harder to repay over time, and at an accelerating rate.  Amazon would have to keep adjusting their interest rate on BTC lines of credit to stave off the possibility of a disaster, which would only make the credit more difficult to utilize.  This is widely understood by economists, and it is among the more important reasons that governments work hard to prevent their currencies from deflating.",1362006169

Predictable amounts of either can easily be built into the interest rate of the transaction.",1362006165

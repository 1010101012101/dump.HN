The people that spend the most time here would become the moderators, and we would lose a lot of the votes that ""count"".",1211457581
197060,comment,197039,197057,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Well the Mono project would make any Iron Python development portable to the Mac and Linux and would certainly meet your ""Windows Forms"" type requirement. Still, there are alternatives being suggested on this post that could meet the need by supplying just the GUI components.",1211457528

197052,comment,197039,197039,0,0,bdfh42,,,"For the Windows platform, you could always get a copy of ""Programming Windows"" by Charles Petzold and call the Win32 API directly (not really recommended). For a native Windows look I suppose that Iron Python would be optimal as it has full access to the .NET Framework.The Mono project has made that effectively portable to the other supported platforms but you would end up having to immerse yourself in the .NET world view.<p>Otherwise I get the impression that most other GUI kits for Python have a ""look"" of their own and are thus going to stand out a bit on any given platform.<p>I will certainly be tracking this post to see what suggestions come up - thanks for posting the question.",1211456047

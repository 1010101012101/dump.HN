The 10% rule states that any student in the top 10% of their graduating high school class is automatically admitted to the university; no questions asked. When you consider the range of quality among high schools in a state as large as Texas, you can imagine the disparity between the valedictorian of the best public school vs. the 9.99%-ranked student of the worst one. <p>As a result, the intro classes are populated with the type of students mentioned in the article -- those that are there for the wrong reasons, and don't really have any direction.   The later classes suffer from this to a lesser extent, but the university's leniency when it comes to failing classes and the length it takes to receive a diploma is still problematic (some students take up to 6, 7 years to graduate).<p>Thus, the solution is to isolate oneself among the outstanding students, i.e., in honors and graduate classes,  in computer science in my case (or any other difficult field that acts as a natural filter), where the top students reside, who are truly excellent and stand among those from any top school.<p>Case in point: I am often surprised to meet students that were accepted to top-notch schools - -- but couldn't enroll for one reason or another, such as money, that I wouldn't consider outstanding students. I wonder if a more competitive school would be ""easier"" because I would be pushed to excellence instead of striving for excellence in spite of a standard of mediocrity.<p>That said, Computer Science at UT is an excellent and competitive program. This is true of most of the hard sciences, math, physics, and a few others, but I truly question the validity of certain degrees...

85422,comment,85356,85395,0,0,iamwil,,,"For hackers that can build your own pieces from scratch, I'd say--because it cuts down on your development time.  By analogy I can definitely write my own mapping widget in javascript, but if I'm  trying out a concept where building a mapping widget isn't the point (but rather an app that showed me where my friends are), it would be prudent to try it out w/ the google maps API first.  So if there's something that I can snap together using Bug, I'd do that first, and only go to soldering boards if it's something I can't do with Bug.  And if the concept doesn't work, I can unsnap it, rather than unsolder chips.<p>For the other types of geeks...not all software developers are hardware people nowadays.  Not that you need to be, but not knowing hardware puts things like mobile devices that aren't phones, sensor networks, and RFIDs out of your reach.  Having a platform like Bug frees you from having to know it if what you need to do fits in Bug's framework.<p>It's true that most of what they have appeals to builder geeks.  Will it be something your non-geek friends would use?  That remains to be seen, but they seem to be creating an environment that allows freedom to create things their non-geek friends would want.  If the geeks make stuff where a Bug brick's functionality can be modular and snapped on without requiring programming, then that might be a possibility.  <p>I think a lot of hardware people are looking to open up the hardware world like they see going on in the software world.  This is one interpretation of what open hardware might look like.<p>No problem, since it challenges my own thinking.  Thanks for being clear headed and courteous about it.",1196628055

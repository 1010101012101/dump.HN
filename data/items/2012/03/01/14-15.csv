It makes me wish I knew people that would want to discuss this with me at a quiet diner.<p>I always likened the spirit to the state of a cpu, and the brain as the cpu.  You could import someone else's spirit into my brain, and their reality would have my body.  Someone else's memories are the way my neurons are connected, their current thoughts stored in whatever the registers to my brain are.<p>All of these states of my spirit can be imported into another brain and I'll be unaware.  It could be possible every morning a new body is recreated for me on another planet and my state is imported into it with my memories, and I am oblivious.  In fact, I could be created at any discrete instant, even just now, and be unaware.<p>Someone said that if we ever got technology good enough to emulate reality virtually, then the odds of us being in one are really good.  That single concept sort of blew my mind.  There's just so many interesting facets to this correlation between the brain, mind, and computers.

Also the barrier to entry with learning rails is a little tricky. PHP by comparison is fairly easy to get up and running. Some view this in the negative, or as arrogant elitism. I tend to think the high barrier to entry is innocuous and unintentionally weeds out those who arnt committed to their craft.<p>Is there not a single rails developer who isn't totally full of themselves? It's a programming language. It's not magic, and rails doesn't mean you're a good programmer. I'm more and more frustrated every time I read stuff like this. When I was learning Rails I was berated with tutorials that made statements like ""Rails is a whole new way of thinking"" or ""Rails means you don't have to work with cruft like braces!!"". It's like being the apple fan-boy for a programming language.

Forget the politicians, the intended use is for modifying people's behaviour.  From friends' anecdotes (both Japanese friends and those who spent many years in Japan), there is strong pressure to conform in Japanese schools.  Imagine this scenario:<p>Speech jammers are introduced into Japanese schools.  From the article: We have to establish and obey rules for proper turn-taking when speaking.""  Sounds like a school to me.  This type of technology used on kids could have long-term impact on their ability to think during public conversations.  And once the teacher realizes they can silence any student at will, do you think they'll stop at the ""louder, stronger"" voices?  Any student with an opinion the teacher doesn't like could get zapped.  And the worst part is not that other students won't hear their ideas -- it's that the student herself will have those thoughts disrupted.<p>Entrepreneurs are who we are because we think outside the box -- we do things we're told can't be done.  Most people aren't like that. And imagine if every time you talked about anything ""out of the norm"" as a child your very thoughts were stopped.  Chilling.<p>I guess if Japanese authorities want that kind of conformity, it might help the US economy...but I'm still not a fan.",1330612035

(This is mostly as these same ""normal people"" also often don't understand that website scraping can be automated; a sad misapplication of almost-reasonable cost heuristics to a system they don't understand.)<p>However, on Twitter there is an extra wrinkle: neither the site nor the API allow you to go back more than 800 tweets for any view, whether it be ""search results matching X"" or ""tweets that mention me"" or ""tweets posted by user Y"" (the one exception being ""your own tweets"", where you can go back 3200).<p>This means that if you tweet a lot, it is impossible for another user to go back very far into your history.

That is, if I have an object that contains a list of names, `grep' doesn't have to support grepping over my object, it just has to support grepping over a list.  You can just call `grep myObject.names Phil'.<p>I don't think making objects less generic is a good idea, but rather we need to interact with them differently.",1246690741

Hacker News is like the nerdiest of nerds.<p>Seriously, I came from Ukraine when I was 12 and being an out-of-shape immigrant and a nerd made my life in American school a living hell.<p>The problem I remember having the most was isolation. It's interesting because people did make fun of me in Ukraine all the time, but we made fun of everyone and were pretty much all friends, we conversed a lot, even when we were fighting.<p>In U.S. it's just different, people ignore you. Spending 8 hours in a place where no one talks to you except for teacher (and several accidental buddies) is pretty miserable. I often thought it'd be easier if I was bullied, at least someone would fucking notice me. Took me a around 4-5 years before I became a misantrophist and just started hating everyone by default and that's sort of how I managed living here.",1246690493

As far as the Web replacing the OS... Honestly if HTTP/HTML is the sole future of innovation in computing then that is a bit sad. As for Cloud Computing, well, let's say the reports of the demise of systems research have been greatly, greatly exagerrated. Actually, looking at my dept this just seems to be a pitifully naive view.there are plenty of projects and not the time nor enough grad students to do them all.",1246690281

A particular species surviving or not is just like rolling a die and observing that the 3 has come up and the other numbers didn't. It's useless to say that 4 wasn't successful. Nobody would say that, but when it comes to evolution people start to talk about success as if nature had intentions.",1246689687

I've worked with OS's that try and de-emphasize (or eliminate) the traditional file system and it just doesn't work.  Programmers eventually hack their own ""file system"" to work with the files that everyone has.  When every computer is networked and connected to the Internet, communicating by files, file names, and file extensions, is universal.",1246689408

When I first heard about it (as a standalone instrument) I assumed it was simply ""dvorak"" for piano: With practice it might give you a nominal advantage.<p>A bit later, I actually saw and played one in a music store. It had never occurred to me before that the piano was, in effect, one dimensional. It was forced to be so by the row of strings behind it. A two dimensional keyboard is a revolution and a half! Relating notes to each other by 2d positioning <i>really</i> starts to mess with your mind.<p>The first question I had was ""how do I move the notes around on the keys?"" as thousands of fascinating pattern possibilities sprang to mind. (Janko-like perhaps?) Sadly, on the standalone demo unit that was there, this was not possible. (The ""Harmonic Table"" layout they have on it is very cool though) With a midi controller version and some clever programming, I'll bet its easy. $500 is a lot for a mere midi controller but its tempting.<p>I'm half the way to inspired to get a box of buttons and an arduino from sparkfun and see what I can come up with on my own.",1246689396

I'm not yet sure that packrat parsing itself is a win, but I'm pretty sure PEGs are, just for expressiveness.<p>I did a simple PEG parser generator (66 lines, generates code in JavaScript, <a href=""http://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/15acbdd6f7108117fd0d2788f055cd4476ccfd95/peg.md"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/kragen/peg-bootstrap/blob/15acbdd6f7108117...</a>) and since then I've been thinking about computing one-character follow-sets to speed up PEG parsing with predictive parsing.<p>What I think is <i>really</i> interesting is the OMeta work on things like program analysis and code generation using PEGs. I feel like there's a deeper connection between ML-style pattern-matching and PEG-parsing hiding somewhere in there, but I haven't been able to tase it out yet.",1246689087

686946,comment,686853,686861,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Perhaps the design should be ""everything is a Resource"" (ala REST) rather than ""everything is an Object"".<p>The beneficial aspect of ""everything is a File"" is the uniform interface: you can read a file, write to a file, seek to a particular position in a file (sometimes), and that's about it. It seems limiting, but that's what allows the huge number of interoperable tools to be built.<p>By going with ""everything is an Object"", there are no constraints on the interface. Every class of objects has it's own set of methods, and tools need to be designed for specific classes/interface rather than for ""everything"". Interoperability will be lost.<p>Resources are like objects, but constrained to uniform interface: their methods are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD. That's all the methods you need to manipulate individual objects and collections of objects. Of course, you'll need uniform identifiers (URLs) for the objects, and a uniform representation (or a set of standard representations.)<p>This will give you network-transparent resources, assuming you use globally unique URIs. It also turns the OS into a generic Web Service. I'm not sure what the implications are of that, but it seems like it might be interesting to explore.",1246688369

686943,comment,686853,686861,0,0,barrkel,,,"Strongly disagree re streams; streams / data-flow oriented programming is extremely easy to parallelize, and isn't going away in the future for at least that reason.<p>It's trivial today to write a bash script utilizing fork/join parallelism (& and wait, in bash) with streams and fifos for data transfer, and only a little care with ordering to guarantee no concurrency bugs. I do it all the time.<p>Objects overemphasize a method-full interface. Files force one to use a single pair of methods, read and write, which are the fundamental units of message sending. Objects as implemented in languages like C# are a bastardization of message sending, where the optimization of the message call reduces its composability in the large. When your messages are small packets of data, abstracting over communicating processes gets a <i>whole</i> lot easier.",1246688162
686941,comment,686840,686852,0,0,kmavm,,,"And two years earlier had come VMware.<p>The explosion of interest in virtualization was started by VMware, a commercial entity, which rather makes Pike's point. Xen was started in response to the lack of an academia-friendly platform for virtualization research; ""paravirtualization"" was not initially a design goal, but rather an expedient choice to avoid the difficulties of correctly virtualizing the x86.<p>And while I'm biased, VMware's solution to this problem (dynamic binary translation from supervisor x86 to user-level x86) is massively more inventive, interesting and <i>useful</i> than Xen's solution (hack up the kernel). I emphasize ""useful"", because a lot of VMware's customers were most interested in running Windows, which was not paravirtulization-ready until 2008, a full ten years after VMware's products were available.",1246687362

Also, acquisition is not a viable exit plan.  Last but not least, they don't seem Googley enough.<p>Oh, wait -- you were serious?  Because I wasn't... I will feel a teeny tiny bit bad for these guys if Google doesn't buy them, because it's so obvious that acquisition is their desired endpoint.  Not that they haven't created a desirable product for people to use and Google to acquire, mind you -- it just doesn't seem like any sort of an afterthought.",1198208666

Economies of scale will eventually kick in, but that could take generations. For instance, think of the bandwidth needed to monitor and control all the cars on the on the highway system, let alone most side roads where you're more likely to find grandma.<p>On a side note: I know I would be very reluctant to give up the psychological thrill of driving. The government would literally have to pry the steering wheel from my cold dead hands.",1198208434

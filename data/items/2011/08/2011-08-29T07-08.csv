2936365,comment,2935944,2936326,19,0,jacques_chester,,,"My point is, and it remains, that the problem is not technological.<p>Is it possible now to instantly poll all citizens, at any moment, on a question of law? Absolutely. Indeed we've had that technology for decades -- since the 50s at least with tabulators and telephones.<p>The point I am making, and which I was originally being downvoted for making, is that <i>technology is not the point</i>. Social dynamics <i>are</i> the point.<p>Ancient Athenians lived in a geographically small area, such that the several thousand citizens could all participate in any matter of public policy, lawmaking and justice if they so chose to. Many did so.<p>Periodically, a particularly charismatic leader would arise and obtain of great power. The Athenians, acting entirely within the limits of their constitution, eventually came undone. In the process they killed Socrates for asking annoying questions and wracked the Peloponnesian peninsula in war for many years, which is <i>how</i> they came undone.<p>The Romans established a Republic as a reaction to the demise of a monarchy. It was riddled with inconsistencies, but contained many of the features we now recognise as common. For example, there was one lawmaking body elected from a limited franchise (the Senate) and another from a broader franchise (the Tribunes).  They tussled frequently, but each jealously guarded its privilege. Rome, an obscure city whose only natural advantage was in being found athwart a salt trade route, came to dominate much of the world while still exercising representative democracy.<p>In practical terms, what does a direct democracy with proxies buy us? The main advantage is, in theory, to assign power, through proxies, on topics to experts. That is, it's meant to be a meritocratic-democratic fusion.<p>Fine, except:<p>* How do you define a proxy's limits? I say ""Bruce Schneier has my proxy on matters of cryptography"". What does that cover? Simply voting on NIST competitions? Mandating the use of SSL in banking? Some say in the operation of the NSA? Here come thousands of nasty court cases to settle the boundaries.<p>* What about conflicts of proxy? If I give Bob my proxy on ""the internet"" and Jill my proxy on ""fibre optics"", whose proxy prevails when the question is about regulating Google's purchase of dark fibre?<p>* What about generality? We can assumably assign proxies to any level of generality or specification. Say that Ashton Kutcher, who holds 3 million proxies good for any subject, weighs in against Bruce Schneier over crypto, only holding 500,000 proxies on crypto alone. Is that the outcome you want?<p>* Demagogues! Bob, who has 500,000 proxies on education policy after a lifetime of careful study, experience and rumination, is suddenly exposed as being gay. Fox News hints he's in league with the devil. Overnight Glenn Beck cries a bit and acquires 2 million education proxies.<p>* Transferable proxies / sub-proxies. Beck's proxies cause Bob to be outvoted. Beck's viewers, who have now tuned into <i>World's Greatest Unicycle Crashes III</i>, forget that they ever assigned that proxy. 6 months later Beck sub-proxies the 2 million he still holds to the CEO of EvilCo. Hilarity ensues.<p>I just don't see it scaling.",1314604616

There are still two other branches.  How is this so hard to understand?<p>Elected representatives are <i>supposed to fully represent their constituents</i>.  There is not supposed to be a difference between the rep. and who they represent.  What direct democracy says is that the proxy of a representative has been corrupted and is no longer necessary.  That is all.<p>P.S. The whole notion that representatives are ""smarter"" than their constituents is both false (Michelle Bachman?) and elitist.

2936331,comment,2936019,2936019,1,0,Mz,,,"""Plan the same trip"" doesn't make sense.  I would suggest rewording that. (Maybe ""trip sharing"" or ""itinerary sharing""? Or even ""duffel sharing""?)  I had enough trouble figuring out what the site does that I went to the About page (and still don't feel I got the answers I was looking for -- like ""why is it called duffel?"").  On that page, I would reword the ""for travelers and non-travelers"".  It's an artificial demarcation and I don't think it's what you really want/intend to convey.  Those folks who would see themselves as ""non-travelers"" are not going to appreciate the idea that using the site implies they are letting themselves get talked into a future trip.  Consider finding a way to package it as ""virtual trips"" (or ""virtual travelers"") or something -- to make it clear that you can use the site to collect info on a place of interest even if you aren't actively planning a trip there without implying that use of the site is intent to someday actually go there.  It's perhaps splitting hairs but I know that the wording is a turn-off for me and doesn't inspire me to consider using the site to simply collect info about cool places of interest.<p>I am thinking back in high school or college, in some French class, I did a ""virtual trip to Paris"" as an assignment.  This was pre-internet and it involved collecting maps and things.  A virtual trip can have value in itself without going anywhere.  I don't travel much, though I have moved around a lot (former military wife).  The whole ""vacation"" mentality is something I have never been able to wrap my brain around.  I like moving someplace new and living there for a couple of years but the idea of going someplace for a week or two just makes me cross-eyed.  I don't get it.  So you are completely missing the mark for me as an individual.  If you are trying to convince me that your site has some place in my life, the site fails to convey that -- even though with analyzing it for purposes of giving you feedback, it seems obvious I could probably still use the site for planning to move somewhere or just collect info about places of interest.<p>And, yes, I have made many trips -- gone on vacations with family (planned by relatives, not me) and visited relatives and hit national landmarks en route to new duty stations and so on. I actually have a life and get around at times but my mental model for that doesn't sync up at all with the way the site presents the idea.  So my guess is that if your intent (with talking about ""for non-travelers"") is to give it broad appeal and pull in people like me, you need to work on that.  I don't see myself as a ""non-traveler"".  Nor do I see myself as a ""traveler"".   You have completely failed to convey why I should use the site and presented the info in a way that makes me think ""eh, nice but of zero relevance to my life...moving on"".  If it weren't for the act of trying to give you feedback on it on HN, I would likely completely forget the site and there would be no hope of getting me signed up.<p>Edit:  I will add that my ex and I used to do day trips a lot and those were planned.  No hotels were involved.  We would go do touristy stuff that was close enough to where we lived that we could drive there, do the touristy thing and go back to sleep in our own beds. (Since we were a military family and moved a lot, we would make a list of things to see and do when we got to a new duty station and try to hit as many of them as we could before life took us elsewhere.) Your site just screams to me ""this is for people with lots more money than I ever had who will be staying in a hotel someplace exotic for a week or more -- that's totally not me"".  Day trips can be very rewarding, can involve planning, and are not remotely suggested by anything on the site.<p>Best of luck.",1314603361

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own.<p>But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; <i>and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</i>""<p>[emph added]<p><a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.h...</a><p>Burke is already presaging the exact topic we're discussing: whether democracy is about the direct will of the people, or whether an elected representative has duties other than merely voting as his electors wish him to.",1314602875

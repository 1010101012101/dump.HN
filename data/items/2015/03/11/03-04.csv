While the rules themselves are on par with Australia / NZ (= much easier than US), the transition is not well thought out. CIC&#x27;s CEC quota screwup of late 2014 is just one of many examples. Students, PNP nominees, TFWs have all been screwed in different ways in 2014. While CIC touts shorter processing times for select categories, they&#x27;re often using MagicMath. For many categories of applicants processing times doubled to quadrupled last year.",1426046351

9182512,comment,9181288,9181288,0,0,hudibras,,,"Because there may be some confusion here about what HR does, I&#x27;ll pick one of the less-salacious episodes, the RPX board seat issue, to illustrate how it would play out at an organization which had a competent HR department.<p>First off, understand that discrimination based on sex or pregnancy is illegal in the United States. So if Ellen Pao walked into our hypothetical competent HR department and said that she had reason to believe that she&#x27;s being discriminated against, HR would have cleared somebody&#x27;s schedule to work with Ellen on this. It&#x27;s serious shit, in other words.<p>HR would ask Ellen for everything on her side of the story (essentially the same stuff that&#x27;s coming out in court now), and then draft up a brief which describes all the evidence (using the term &quot;evidence&quot; loosely here because this is just Ellen&#x27;s side for now). HR would then take this file to the person who is allegedly discriminating against Ellen (I think it would be John Doerr in this case) and say, &quot;I need your undivided attention on this, this is a serious matter&quot; and then get John&#x27;s side of the story.<p>After that, each situation is different, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious to me that in the RPX case, HR would say to John &quot;Look, it appears that Ellen did much more work on this than Randy so you need to think about why he got the board seat over her.&quot;<p>In most workplaces, at this point John would look over the documentation and realize that he probably DID discriminate against her and, most importantly, would be aghast at what he&#x27;d done. So then HR would work with both Ellen and John to develop a solution, which would probably include John apologizing to Ellen for undervaluing her contribution and a promise that he&#x27;ll do better in the future. End Scene.<p>So in this scenario, not only does HR prevent a lawsuit from happening but also the company gets to keep a valued employee who can keep adding to the bottom line while at the same time educating her superior to keep better track of the contributions of all employees regardless of their race, sex, or background.",1426046157

I still haven&#x27;t picked it up (shipped it to the US, getting there next week only), but it arrived at my friend&#x27;s house with no problem. From all I read before making the purchase, it is a good phone, not hacker-proof though, as there is no such thing as a secure computer. But on the other hand, their development team has been extremely fast in patching bugs and pushing fixes.<p>Also, for those claiming that it is still uses insecure baseband chips and firmwares, the phone comes with Silent Circle suite apps which allows you to make end-to-end encrypted calls and messages, so even if you have a flawed baseband chip, it was built so you could have secure calls and messages through wifi, 3g or 4g, without worrying about the security vulnerabilities of those chips.",1426046144

9182500,comment,9178773,9179260,0,0,dasil003,,,"Where this line of reason goes completely off the rails is in thinking that schema-less databases are a hedge for future uncertainty.  Yes they let you churn out code slightly faster, but then your data becomes a ball of mud just as quickly as your code base, except the former is much much worse because when you pivot you still need your data even if you decide to chuck out all the code that goes with it.<p>In fact, a traditional RDBMS is designed to allow for any kind of ad-hoc querying you desire with reasonable performance, and the ability to normalize/denormalize, index and materialize views in order to optimize unforeseen use cases.  The excuse of poor scalability is just a rationalization that some kids who didn&#x27;t understand SQL used to justify using something that has a shiny marketing page that they ignorantly found more viscerally appealing.  The tradeoff was all wrong, because 99.9% of projects will never need to scale beyond a single DB server, and for those that do, the flexibility of a well-defined schema and ad-hoc queryability will give them an early advantage in what kind of pivots are reasonable—if they are lucky enough to have to scale then they can replace the RDBMS with the context of knowing what exactly their use case that they must scale is.  And at that point you&#x27;ll presumably have the resources to do it, which is much more effective than prematurely attempting to design a scalable infrastructure and discovering that you didn&#x27;t have the first clue what the real bottlenecks or even the full use case would be.",1426045901

But here&#x27;s an anecdote, the price of short ribs has <i>dramatically</i> gone up. My wife is Korean, so short ribs (galbi) are a favorite dish. We used to be able to buy several pounds of ribs, a huge pile of them, for $20-30. They were so cheap, and there were so many of them, and the way they were packaged was in such large packages, that it would take us several meals to get through them. It used to be a regular thing for us to go get some ribs, grab a few friends and spend a lazy afternoon in the park cooking Korean bbq and we&#x27;d all go home stuffed. We used to even buy it when we were much less well off it was such a cheap and satisfying meal.<p>Only a decade later, $30-40 buys you enough for a couple people, if we eat a side of rice and other food with it.<p>As a result, galbi has turned into a rare treat, despite us being much better-off financially, it&#x27;s so expensive compared other foods that it&#x27;s just not worth it anymore. Even restaurants we frequent will have a menu of $10-12 meals and then galbi (1 person&#x27;s service) will be something like $18-20.<p>My understanding is that over 90% of cows are fed mostly with corn feed, so if corn goes up, the price of cows go up.<p>We&#x27;re also starting to see some minor kickback against HFCS. The story is that it&#x27;s bad for health, but my personal theory is that companies are trying to rework supply chains around other sugar sources in the event corn subsidies disappear. &quot;Mexican Coke&quot; and &quot;Throwback Pepsi&quot; are regulars at my local stores. Sold at a slightly higher price than the HFCS varieties.<p>I haven&#x27;t read this yet, but it appears to look at some of these relationships. <a href=""http://www.card.iastate.edu/policy_briefs/display.aspx?id=1155"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.card.iastate.edu/policy_briefs/display.aspx?id=11...</a>",1426044224

9182308,comment,9178523,9182116,0,0,eastbayjake,,,"I&#x27;m hopeful that normalized relations with Cuba will be the end of our crazy corn subsidies. If you want to make ethanol, sugarcane is 7x more energy efficient in producing ethanol compared to corn, and you can produce twice as much ethanol from an acre of sugarcane as an acre of corn[1]. And if you want to sweeten food and beverages, the same energy efficiency applies to cane sugar harvesting: you can get more sugar with less harvesting energy per acre of sugarcane than corn. (Although there&#x27;s little science supporting cane sugar being healthier than high-fructose corn syrup.)<p>It seems like the Cuba detente has broken a constituent stalemate in Congress: a small group of Florida sugarcane farmers corner the market on US cane sugar and no one has wanted to normalize relations and import sugarcane from Cuba because of those farmers&#x27; political clout, even though our countries&#x27; comparative advantage should dictate growing sugarcane in poor, developing Cuba and exporting it for food and ethanol use in the US.[2] There&#x27;s been a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement among senators that props up these farm subsidies because no one wants to rock the boat and jeopardize their own state&#x27;s subsidies, but California is pushing back as our farmers get hammered by drought and Florida now has little to lose for opposing Midwestern farmers&#x27; lucrative corn subsidies.<p>[1] <a href=""https://biowesleyan.wordpress.com/first-generation-biofuels/ethanol/case-study-brazil/sugarcane-vs-corn-based-ethanol/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://biowesleyan.wordpress.com/first-generation-biofuels/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://fcir.org/2012/09/09/in-sugar-price-supports-sour-tastes-for-consumers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fcir.org/2012/09/09/in-sugar-price-supports-sour-tast...</a>",1426042889

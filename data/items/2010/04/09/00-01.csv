I could see the two platforms merging in certain ways. For instance if you added a multi-touch screen to the current MacBook, retaining the keyboard/touchpad, you'd have an interesting platform. You'd have desktop multi-touch apps very similar to iPad apps but you'd also be able to use traditional OSX apps. There could be some system wide multi-touch features along the lines of what they're doing with the multi-touch trackpads already to enhance these applications.",1270774701

But one of the major reasons is that the US effectively subsidizes drug development for the rest of the world. US buyers generally have to pay full market rate, and then in other countries prices are fixed artificially low by government fiat. The US probably can't continue paying that subsidy forever, so eventually either other countries will have to pay more, or the US will also start fixing prices and thus research funds will dry up.",1270774357

1251515,comment,1250958,1251232,0,0,lmkg,,,"At the individual developer level, you are correct. There are quite a number of people who prefer, to varying extents, to work on FOSS software and who will accept certain amounts of disincentives, inconveniences, and sacrifices to do so because they're outweighed by the personal incentive of working on such projects.<p>Joel is talking at the level of corporations, not of individuals. All of his examples are of the strategic move of a company, not the personal belief of an individual (or the collective action of a group that is united by their beliefs). And the major take-away is, you don't need a non-monetary incentive to support FOSS, because there are monetary incentives. Open-source and profit-motive are not inherently opposed.<p>So yes, the assumption he's making is that money is an incentive for promoting open source. For some, especially for companies, it is. For some, it is not. It's reasonable to expect that when companies are supporting it, they have something to gain by doing so, and Joel is spelling out how. That doesn't invalidate the personal motivations that some people may have, but neither do those motivations invalidate the more traditional monetary motivations that the companies (and some individuals) have either.",1270773125

I bet this clause disqualifies the majority of serious applications in the app store. Anything with a generated parser, for example, can now be rejected. Objective-C is definitely a kiddie language, it's highly dynamic and mostly suitable for creating a OO interface to lower-level code written in C, which is how almost all of OS X and Apple software works.

Yes, it is fast and distributed and can be redundant. To that I say, it is too new, it has a steep learning curve, there aren't any tools to abstract away the database portion.<p>Now SQL has ease of use, a myriad of tools such as ActiveRecord, or Hibernate, an ANSI specification.  All of which allow developers to quickly pump out a site that will handle the needs of 98% of the businesses out there.<p>There is no need for a small time web store to be using a Hadoop Cluster, just like we wouldn't expect Google to be running on a MySQL backend.<p>As someone who has worked in both sides of the industry, I can definitely say that trying to integrate a NoSQL solution with a standard 3 Tier type website would increase the cost of development 10 fold.  Sure, you can get it with no license fee, but you end up paying for it elsewhere.<p>Basically it boils down to NoSQL != NoPricetag<p>P.S> I recently wasted a week of my life trying to get HBase up and working on a small cluster with the data from our Vertica solution.

The dock is very silly and graphical when you have quicksilver or gnome-do. Chrome is a better browser and browser UI experience than Safari in my opinion (and lots of people like firefox and opera more). The Finder vs Nautilus differences aren't big enough really, there are pros and cons to each. Apple stuff is well designed until you want to go past just cookie cutter customizations and then the openness IS the UI because I define it to work how I want to.<p>The same caries over to other things. Sure the install and uninstall of applications on OSX is a great UI. But apt-get just seriously leaves it in the dust. The problem with linux was never that it had a bad UI or was too customizable. The problem with linux was actual hardware bugs in drivers, lack of office, lack of flash, lack of games. Which have mostly been addressed asides from games (which is a sore point for Apple too). UI is far too overrated over actual features.<p>And it's all based on a myth. Steve Jobs ringing up SUN over their looking glass and threatening with UI patents is just ridiculous. As are the claims to Apple fame with interfaces taken from Xerox.<p>So yes, I agree Apple are very good, possibly the best at UIs. But my points are 1) UIs aren't as massively important as people say, 2) Apple's ""innovations"" have been overrated 3) your statement that ""no human beings on the entire planet other than those that work at One Infinite Loop in Cupertino are capable of doing a UI"" is just ridiculous.",1270772340

I've seen the same reasoning given other names, but for someone versed in formal logic and probability theory, this is a very nice presentation of the concepts.<p>Key points:<p>- in Bayesian reasoning, beliefs are not held as absolutes, but as probabilities.<p>- observations / measurements change those probabilities (using Bayes' formula).  As a special case, certain measurements may set certain probabilities to zero; viewing only the ""zero/nonzero"" dichotomy is equivalent to classical logic.<p>- as a counterpoint to Holmes' ""When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth"", beware that you may have treated something as impossible which is merely highly improbable.  There is a significant difference between actually zero and merely very close to zero.<p>- A implies B does not mean B implies A.  But A makes B more likely does mean B makes A more likely; this is a consequence of Bayes' formula.  (This does not imply causation.

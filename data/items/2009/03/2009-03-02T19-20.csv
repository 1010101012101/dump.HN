500506,comment,500393,500393,0,0,akeefer,,,"What he's imagining is somewhat close to what we do with our currently-internal (hopefully open source some day) ORM framework (which is on Java).  Our schema is defined as metadata in XML, and we build a checksum off the XML to compare against what's in the database in order to know when to upgrade.  To ensure the stability of the checksum, it's built off of a filtered, sorted version of the XML DOM tree, rather than the actual files.  Not all changes to the files will affect the checksum, since certain bits of the metadata don't affect the data or the schema.<p>We do still use explicit version numbering for version triggers (our name for migrations), since it's just too hard if the numbers aren't meaningful.  If you just used a checksum, how would you know if A248B5FC comes before or after 3F56EB2?  It's a little easier if you can say ""the DB is at version 23, and the latest is version 26, so we need to run these three triggers.""  The database stores both the metadata checksum as a hash and a version number; if the hash changes without the version number changing, we at least know that's an error and can detect it.  Certain types of changes (like adding a nullable column) we handle automatically by diffing the current schema against the actual DB schema, while anything more complicated (and anything that touches the data) requires an explicit trigger.<p>Since we build deployed enterprise software that gets upgraded on the scale of years, not days or weeks, we also follow the course of using triggers only on production databases.  It's still not really a perfect solution for all sorts of reasons I could go into, but it's interesting that we ended up pretty close to what he's proposing.",1236022258

If the patent holder is an individual who doesn't have big pockets, it might take a few years before he is aware that his patent is being infringed; he might spend a year trying to get the infringing company to negotiate a licensing deal; he might spend a year trying to find a law firm willing to take the case on contingency; and that law firm might spend a year trying to negotiate and/or collecting evidence before actually launching a lawsuit.  So even without any deliberate attempts to delay enforcement it's entirely possible for a patent to be infringed for five years or more before a lawsuit happens.",1236022057

500496,comment,500393,500393,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Database migration has been solved for a long time.  This author is having trouble getting his head around it because he's starting from flawed assumptions, and is limited by his choice of tools.<p>Here's how you do it:<p><pre><code>  - every database has a build number stamped into it
  - every schema change goes into a change script called build_105-106.sql
  - changes are applied to the dev database as they are made
  - the automated build pins the change script and runs it against an integration database
  - a schema diff tool is used to compare dev and integration schemas.  if they don't match, the build breaks.
  - the build creates a file called build_106-107.sql and sticks it into source control
</code></pre>
There's simply no way you can get your schemas out of synch this way.  If you screw up and commit a change straight to dev without scripting out the change, it will break the next build and it will hurt to fix it.  You'll learn quickly not to try to shortcut the process.  (It's really not that hard a process anyway).<p>But the big thing the author is getting wrong is that he's trying to define schema from his application.  His ORM seems to be generating both code and schema from config files, which seems a bit silly from an outsider's viewpoint.  It's causing him a lot of pain and he doesn't understand why.<p>Define the schema in the schema.  Generate your code from that.  Problem solved.",1236021913

Nevertheless, I am anti-copyright.<p>There are several arguments against copyright, but the one I like most is this: property is necessary because two people cannot both (exclusively) use the same property at the same time.  The idea of property solves this, and everyone can agree that <i>that</i> is yours while <i>this</i> is mine.  The nature of things is that they can't be available for the exclusive use of two or more people.  Ideas (copyright and patents, at least; trademarks are less clear) can be used by more than one person without any impact on others using it: everyone can exclusively use an idea at the same time.  The reason for this is that ""an idea"" isn't a thing at all, but a <i>category</i> of things -- a description of a group, each instance of which is owned by virtue of someone owning the physical thing that instantiates it.<p>In summary: I don't believe in ownership of categories of things, only things themselves.<p>If you look at the origins of copyright, even its supporters didn't believe it was real property; it was purely a utilitarian attempt to encourage production of ideas by extending an analogy of property to idea production, for a limited time.  There are still reasonable arguments to be made about whether it's an net economic win or lose for a legal system to include copyright and patent, and other people can argue that point better than I.",1236021144

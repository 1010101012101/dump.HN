88650,comment,88457,88641,0,0,ingenium,,,"Off topic, but I've always thought it would be really cool if something like a fungus evolved that fed off solar radiation. This fungus could convert the energy from radiation into matter/molecules for itself to grow. It would then grow off the planet into space and eventually surround that planet's sun, at a safe distance of course. A similar fungus has evolved on Earth that lives inside the Chernobyl reactor and uses the radiation for energy. <p>The thing is, this fungus would be arguably much more successful than humans.",1197446009

88646,comment,88527,88577,0,0,icky,,,"> Uh huh... using EC2 for storage sounds like a bad idea, especially since data on EC2 instances isn't persistent...<p>There are workarounds, involving multiple instances and hoping that not all of them die at the same time... ;-).  This is probably EC2's biggest current weakness, since you can't just rely on just one node, meaning it doesn't scale down as well as they claim.<p>> While I'm sure they meant S3<p>They probably, correctly, mean EC2.<p>>, you have to wonder about a company that uses them in their product yet still confuses the two.<p>EC2 has per-instance (ephemeral) storage and S3 storage. They are designed to work together.  S3's pricing includes free data transfer to/from EC2 instances (though the terms, last I checked, are vague about whether this includes per-request charges).",1197445317
88645,comment,88457,88641,0,0,ingenium,,,"Yes, but it has been shown that Earth and Mars have been impacted by comets or meteors, and ejected matter into space which then hit the other planet. Life, or at least molecules that are precursors to life, could easily have hopped a ride on these. If it happened later, say after bacteria had evolved, then bacterial spores could have been transported as well. Those things are really hard to destroy.<p>As for a planet that is Earth-like (or Mars-like when Mars was similar to Earth), I think it is a 98% chance or higher. I'd be willing to bet that if life was wiped out on Earth, it would occur again in a billion years or so. It just seems like matter in general has the tendency to organize and behave in a way that favors life. It does things randomly, but once something happens that can kind of reproduce, it stays around. A bunch of these accumulate until it starts to resemble a cell.<p>Many chemical reactions in life would happen on their own in enough time. We use enzymes to make this happen faster. Early life takes a long time to evolve up because it doesn't have these enzymes, so it has to wait for the reaction to just happen.<p>Consciousness, or what we consider consciousness, is perhaps another story.",1197445312

88641,comment,88457,88633,0,0,jey,,,"I agree, given enough planets and enough time, we can reasonably expect to find some other life-like system.<p>Given a sample size of 1 planet (Mars), it seems like wishful thinking, unless you think that life is very likely to develop on any planet that is Mars-like. So if you say ""I think 90% of Mars-like planets will develop life"", then it makes sense. Hell, even if you only give it a 2% chance, we could poke around some. But I bet even if we assume that Mars and Earth have had similar conditions, it would take many thousands of Earth-like planets (at least) before we find another instance of a life-like system, even optimistically.",1197444645

88633,comment,88457,88603,0,0,ingenium,,,"Life actually is pretty common I think. The simplest definition of life would be molecules that replicate. An example of an arguably form of life in space can be found at <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070814150630.ht...</a><p>When you look at the way evolution works, it becomes clear that there is life elsewhere. Let's take a set of atoms. When they're bombarded with energy they react with each other and form compounds. While predictable, there is a slight amount of randomness in this. Eventually, one of these will be able to replicate itself. A simple example is a structure that would interact with other molecules to help them react to produce a duplicate. This is a biological enzyme. The current hypothesis is that early life was just RNA. RNA is a carrier of genetic information, but also can be an enzyme. Common examples are ribosomes, which read the genetic code and make all our proteins from that code, and self-splicing introns. This early RNA was probably able to produce copies of itself. This is life.<p>We see certain molecules important for life, such as a sugar molecule, as being meaningful and special. However, as far as nature is concerned it's not. Take a deck of cards. If you were to shuffle them up, they appear disordered, but that's only because we don't give that particular order a meaning. It's just as probable to get that particular order as it is to get them Ace, king, queen, jack, etc. <p>So basically, life will eventually happen given a long enough period of time. It's inevitable. Life flourished on Earth. Given another very similar system, it's highly probable life was also present there at some point.",1197443487

If there is 1 quarter of decline, then 1 of gain, then another of decline, there is no recession.""<p>True, but long periods of sluggish growth can be worse than a relatively short recession.  Better to get the pain over with quickly than to spread it out over a long period - just ask someone from Japan about the 1990 to ~2004 period of very sluggish growth there.  I'd much prefer a 1 or 2 year severe recession than a 14 year epoch of sluggish growth (and it can oscillate as you mention, going from positive GDP to negative and back again and still not be classified as a recession)",1197443084

88630,comment,88005,88547,0,0,politrix,,,"The genetic diseases you mentioned are significant mutations leading into strong dysfunctionalities in how the brain is supposed to function. Leading it not to function correctly. This is far from evolutionary path leading one population of people into some sort of mental retardation, especially when evolutionary selection would be against it. In addition most of the mentioned diseases are recessive which is the only reason they have survived, as any offspring with the disease won't survive to pass the genes on.<p>Autism is a different case because it's not necessarily genetic (although I'm not sure if there are also genetic cases). In fact autism cases have exploded in recent history, so environmental factors are likely a contributor. One such theory is the vaccines containing mercury which is a strong neuro-toxin decaying neuron connections which would result into the observed behavior. I'm not going into that discussion however.<p>I'm being unspecific about intelligence because it's inherently a very ambiguous concept, which is one of the fallacies of the IQ testing and the arguments given by the racists like in this thread. I can see short comings and non-objectiveness in almost every IQ test I have seen. And that without even taking into account the fact that they're ""adjusted"" periodically to reflect the norm which obviously means they're not perfectly objective to begin with.<p>I was referring to 18th century Germany and for example theories created by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumenbach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumenbach</a>",1197443037

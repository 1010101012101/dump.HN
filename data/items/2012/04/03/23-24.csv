3795446,comment,3794249,3794414,1,0,moe,,,"I have complained in the thread about that kickstarter project already and I'll repeat myself from a slightly different angle here. I say: Installation is not the problem. It's just a pre-taste of what you're getting into and if the standard procedure is so broken that it needs artificial padding then we have a much bigger problem here.<p>That bigger and real problem with Rails is wrong abstractions and too much magic, the stuff that you hit right <i>after</i> installation. In terms of discoverability Rails is the poorest of all popular web-frameworks.<p>I'll say Rails has many things right, but just as many deeply wrong. Which is an amplified problem for absolute beginners - for them it's double hard to unlearn bad patterns after struggling to grasp them in first place.<p>To name just a few:<p>It is <i>not</i> right that the default modus-operandi for pretty much everything (e.g. devise) is to inject a bunch of invisible, undiscoverable magic at installation time and leave the user at best with a few hardly discoverable hints about how it actually works (and where to look when it doesn't).<p>It is <i>not</i> right that rails still makes heavy use of code-generators (related to the previous bullet).<p>It is <i>not</i> right to still have no automation for schema migration. I do in fact claim the ActiveRecord pattern has proven a poor choice for the Rails use-case.<p>etc.<p>For teaching I would claim Rails is about the worst possible choice. It's an opaque blob of magic that provides good leverage when massaged in just the right way. But that ""right"" way is in large parts so undiscoverable and detached from reality that you end up with juniors who may be able to churn out simple rails views - yet are immediately lost when anything diverts from their learned script.<p>So, back on topic. In my experience teaching web-stuff works best bottom up. Start with HTML/CSS, then give them something like sinatra so they get a grasp on what a request is. Even PHP is a valid choice here.<p>Rails is for much later, for when they at least have a remote clue what they're doing.",1333497529

I can import modules and then qualify functions within the modules, or I can import functions directly from the modules, renaming then if I want to. There's no difference, between these options, other than a minor difference in what name I use to refer to the function once its been imported.<p>> Again: dot-notation lets me write:<p>>        import scala.collection.immutable.List<p>>        def addn(n: Int) = (list: List[Int]) => list.map(_ + n)<p>>    Instead of:<p>>        import scala.collection.immutable.List<p>>        def addn(n: Int) = (list: List[Int]) => List.map(list,_ + n)<p>It isn't dot notation that lets you do that; it's the semantics of how functions are\nlocated that lets you do that. Many languages support statically overloaded\nfunctions using functional notation. It's also quite easy to imagine a language\nwhich uses the syntax f(a) to mean what a.f() means in Scala.<p>Also, why is this to be considered so desirable? For the performance gain that comes from eliminating dynamic dispatch? In that case, it is certainly possible for a language that supports multiple dispatch to dispatch statically when it can infer that it is safe to do.<p>> See the difference?<p>Yes, I quite understand the concept, but it has nothing intrinsically to do with dot notation.<p>> And then, remember that map() is not a multimethod.<p>> It doesn't actually do dynamic dispatch on its first argument,<p>> or on any other argument. It's a type-class method; it does static dispatch<p>> on the functor type List[].<p>In Scala? I don't believe that this is correct. As far as I understand, there's a single implementation of map for the entire collection library in TraversableLike, which uses virtual functions provided by the concrete class (and a builder object which gets passed in implicitly) to construct the new container, loop over the old container, and add elements to the new container.<p>This is similar to how map() works in Python and Clojure, where there is a single implementation of map() which uses dynamic dispatch to loop over the elements of the container. The downside to the way that Python and Clojure doing things is that you get iterators or streams back, not the original container type. But they could return the original container type if containers in Python and Clojure were to have virtual constructors. Then map() could call these virtual constructors to return a container of the same type.<p>> You cannot define map() as a generic function, at least not in the sense that<p>> Common Lisp and Clojure use the term ""generic function"".<p>Clearly in a statically typed language, you also need some form of parametric polymorphism in addition to what Common Lisp and Clojure provide in order to preserve types. I see no reason why this should be insurmountable.<p>I've often done things in C++ that wrapped dynamic lookup in a generic function or class, to achieve the types of things that you say require type classes. Another thing you can easily do in C++ is to write template adapter classes to provide something similar to Scala's structural types.<p>Also, type classes surely don't require dot notation. Haskell is from where type classes originate, and Haskell doesn't have dot notation.",1333496608

And once I'm done with my problem sets and things, I can't think of my physics books as being ""leisure"" reading (like I do with programming books).

For instance (directly taken from Python doc) in this case:<p><pre><code>  a = re.compile(r""""""\d +  # the integral part\n                     \.    # the decimal point\n                     \d *  # some fractional digits"""""", re.X)\n  b = re.compile(r""\d+\.\d*"")\n</code></pre>\nthat's useless. But for more complex problems it may be useful (e.g. <a href=""http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/re/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/re/</a> I know email matching regexes are not really complex or even a good example of use of regexes but that's the first example I found).<p>Another point is that even if I can read/write (that's the case) regexes other people may have to deal with my code and it's a well known fact that many people doesn't understand/like regex, so splitting them in small ""chunks"" may help them.",1333494013

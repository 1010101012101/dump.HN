I never thought public speaking or organisation skill etc is skill. I have the wrong belief like how you can talk about it if you are not expert of it. now in china people already start to reduce difficulties of maths problem in exam and pay a bit more attention on soft skill. in US, people might think to equip american kids with more math skill so that in future they can embrace more discipline. one example i see good programmers not willing to do computer graphics because they are worried about their math skills. maybe that is why post like maths you need to know for programming is popular",1437299785

The key to that is mentioned in the article: applying tension while building the wheel. Lots of it, in my (borrowed) experience.<p>The first couple of wheels I built was before I had internet access and I just copied the lacing pattern from an existing wheel, then tightened and trued the wheel. It were the worst wheels I ever had and impossible to keep true (though I was riding trials back then which does require more from wheels).<p>Then one day I found <a href=""http://sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sheldonbrown.com/wheelbuild.html</a> and would basically put all sorts of tension on wheels while building them. Lean on them, hammer the spokes, pull them together, smash the wheel against the wall and so on. This, together whith experience gained from many iterations, yields wheels which do not make the slightest sound when ridden for the first time and stay true even under heavy circumstances (I ride street/dirt on a 24&quot; bmx now).

Start with the knowledge you have and tweak it over time. If you have no knowledge right now, start by sketching in English. It seems stupid but just the fact of abstracting human needs that seem obvious to us and formalizing them into logical steps will help you tremendously.<p>- Write code about random stuff you think about. It will be ugly and you&#x27;ll laugh at it, but you will be lightyears ahead than if you wait when you <i>finish</i> your training to <i>start</i> writing code. It doesn&#x27;t need to be great, awesomely useful or something.<p>- Compare yourself with yourself. &quot;..wrote 3,000 lines of Python in a day to build a Segway&quot; made me hate myself.

9910595,comment,9910408,9910408,0,0,techman9,,,"The thesis of this post is that merge conflicts basically negate all of the other benefits a branched workflow provides. I&#x27;m not sure how the workflow the author suggests deals with concurrent changes to code otherwise though, and I feel like merge conflicts are preferable to changes that overwrite other changes. Not taking advantage of branching destroys much of the benefit a DVCS provides.<p>In order for this workflow to be reasonable for any development team of a size greater than about 3, each commit would need to move all the code in to a working state. While a reasonable pattern in theory (Don&#x27;t TRY commit breaking changes!), it is frequently useful to track code in an intermediate state. Sometimes (read frequently), this code may not be representative of the final state of the technology or may not even work as it should. Not maintaining individual branches means that these changes are exposed to the entire team and can be very very messy.<p>All in all, what a silly approach to revision control.

9910592,comment,9910487,9910487,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"Wow, Mohamed, this is great. I&#x27;m glad I stayed up late enough tonight to see your post. Please feel free to give me a shout via the email address in my profile - I&#x27;d be more than happy to kick around any ideas to help you get started.<p>What kind of computer do you use - Windows, Mac, Linux? I&#x27;d like to give you some suggestions for programming tools (mostly free, some you might pay for), but of course the details will depend on which OS you&#x27;re using.<p>I second nailer&#x27;s suggestion that you may want to start with Python for some of your initial learning. It&#x27;s an easy language to get started with, but also very powerful. Even if you end up using another language later on, your Python skills will remain valuable - it&#x27;s great for writing anything from little scripts up to large apps.<p>Ruby is also really nice, you wouldn&#x27;t go wrong with that either. And of course you&#x27;ll want to learn JavaScript eventually too, regardless of what else you do. You could start with any of these really, but Python is probably the easiest to begin with. What you really want to start out doing is to get the basic <i>concepts</i> of programming down - and these carry over from language to language.<p>One suggestion I&#x27;ll make right away: in every language you work with, find and learn how to use a good debugger. For JavaScript, every browser has a nice built-in debugger. (I like the one in Chrome, but they are all pretty good.) For Python or Ruby it will depend to some degree on which OS you use.<p>And a good IDE with built-in syntax checking, autocomplete, and all that is really great to have.<p>Some people will tell you not to use IDEs and debuggers and things like that, as if it were a sign of weakness to use good tools. Or that if you follow Test Driven Development you should never need to use a debugger. Don&#x27;t listen to them!<p>I see so many people asking questions on Stack Overflow that they could have answered for themselves in a few minutes if they only knew how to <i>debug</i> their code. Testing is important and you should learn all about it and do it, but debuggers are for more than just fixing bugs. They help you explore and learn how your code works, and what the APIs you&#x27;re calling really do, in an interactive and visual way.<p>Here&#x27;s a Stack Overflow post of mine from a couple of years ago with screenshots of a few Python debuggers:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/16474706/1202830"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/16474706/1202830</a><p>Don&#x27;t worry if there&#x27;s a lot of stuff in those screens; it will all make sense as you get into it.<p>You&#x27;ll also want to get into version control sooner rather than later. Most people use Git these days, although Mercurial is very good too. I recommend avoiding the Git command line though, at least at first. You have enough to learn as it is without having to deal with that arcane system. But there are some nice visual interfaces to Git. I like SmartGit a lot and recommend it. It&#x27;s free for noncommercial use. Or you may want to start with something even simpler like one of the free clients from GitHub.<p>Again, let me know what OS you&#x27;re on and I&#x27;ll make some specific suggestions for various kinds of tools.<p>p.s.

What a surprise - and honour - to find my website featured here, this morning.<p>I just want to add a comment: because the sounds are drawn randomly, everyone hears something different! So, comments like &quot;it does sounds more like a brook&quot; may be right, but just for one particular user, and particular occurence.<p>Today, the average visit duration time is about 30s... and it takes my engine about that same time to evolve from one sound to another. If you think that you are not hearing something that does sound like rain to you, either reload the page (it will start all over again with a new draw) or give the generator a longer listen, like two minutes (I know, this is a lot of time, on the Internet). Then, you will understand why this rain noise generator is different from others. It really shines over longer listening sessions.<p>How it works? Basically, I have sounds in four categories: Light Rain, Heavy Rain, Thunder, and Water sounds (like those occurring once the rain has stopped). The generator starts by choosing one of these categories (with higher probabilities for the rain, but sometimes, it can start with the water sounds - hence that user comment). For each category, there are dozens of different recordings. So, even if you keep playing rain from the same category, it will keep changing. Staying in the same category or switching to another is governed by a very simple transition probabilities matrix.<p>Also, you can change the spectrum of the rain (white/pink/brown) by means of the pencil (this setting affects the next draws, so its effect is not instantaneous). Being able to change the color of a natural noise, is an interesting feature, IMHO.<p>Cheers,<p>StÃ©phane",1437297080

That&#x27;s why you need to make the things you want to do continuously â€“ in your case: learning â€“ a habit, i.e. a daily or weekly routine. If you make it a habit, you won&#x27;t need motivation anymore and you won&#x27;t even question whether you should learn right now or rather do something else. You will simply do it. If not, the habit will actually make you feel bad by depriving you from various hormones that make you feel happy.

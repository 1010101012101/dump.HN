10809619,comment,10808821,10808821,0,0,bryanlarsen,,,"What is the purpose of copyright?   From the constitution &quot;to promote the progress of science and the useful arts&quot;.<p>To maximize the creation of intellectual goods, we should pay artists enough money to have them enthusiastically create them, but no more.    Of course, this money should only get paid to people who are creating works that people want to consume.<p>Our music copyright system has many problems, but I think it&#x27;s fairly remarkable that we&#x27;ve stumbled on what I believe is fair prices for it:    $10/mo/user or $15/mo/family for access to a full catalog, or ad-supported free for access to radio-like streaming.   Ad-supported free is pretty meagre, but it was the government that set those rates, so we&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s fair for the sake of this argument.<p>While dividing that $10/mo up by play seems fair, it doesn&#x27;t seem maximal.   A few artists get millions, most are lucky to get enough to get enough to buy a cup of coffee.   They might be making a meagre living touring, but once they decide to have a family they give it up and get a real job.<p>I&#x27;d love to see log scaled payouts to address the problem.  So if you A had 10x as many plays as B and 100x as many plays as C, A would get paid 2x as much as B and 3x as much as C.  (using log10 for illustration -- the natural logarithm or some other lower base would probably be better).<p>Such a change would be relatively easy to make for compulsory-licensed music such as Pandora and other &quot;Internet Radio&quot;.   It would be harder to make for the voluntarily-licensed music such as Spotify, though.",1451429979

It is also one of the symptoms of what is wrong with &quot;enforcement&quot; in that country.<p>Police officers in many other countries (such as Germany for instance) are explicitly instructed to shoot to wound if at all possible - and with good results both in terms of getting their suspects arrested but not killed, and in terms of not getting killed themselves. Indeed, this is not just the case for police worldwide, but even for the US armed forces when working under &quot;nation building&quot; rules of engagements rather than &quot;total war&quot; rules of engagements.<p>A shoot-to-kill doctrine is an obvious sign that rather than having an attitude of serving and protecting their community, the enforcers are serving/protecting themselves first.",1451428839

To keep down the total number of replies in this thread, I&#x27;ll also refer to other questions posted in replies to my comment.<p>I think that Wikipedia currently has a hostile editing culture that especially discourages participation in editing by subject-matter experts, who cannot count working on Wikipedia as &quot;publishing&quot; in the usual way that publishing is rewarded for academics, and who will find the willful ignorance of many Wikipedians more than a little tedious. I don&#x27;t have any problems with the Wikipedia software. A wiki (a broadly editable collaboratively edited document) does seem to be the way to go to build a good, free, online encyclopedia--Wikipedia is proof of concept for that.<p>I think Wikipedia&#x27;s human culture around editing started out pathological and stayed pathological because there was too much domination of the culture by amateurs (in editing) at the beginning of the project. I think a philanthropist would do well to fund a Free Online Encyclopedia X Prize because there are many forms of editorial culture in online wikis that have not yet been tried, and it may be that Wikipedia itself will reform its culture if it is exposed to more competition. (The very small number of people who so far participate actively in editing Wikipedia are easily replaceable if a new project comes along with a culture more welcoming of subject matter experts and of editors with professional editorial experience.) I care not at all which organization wins if there is an X Prize competition, but I would like to see the experiment tried, because plainly people all over the world will continue to use online encyclopedias, and there is still a lot of low-hanging fruit to pick for improving the existing online encyclopedias.<p>I agree with the comment (a subcomment of another reply to my earlier comment) that says that what Wikipedia (or some other project) needs more of is more professional writers who are used to explaining technical concepts to the general public. Yes, Wikipedia needs much more of that, and more sound editorial judgment in general.<p><i>Let&#x27;s think a bit broader: if you did truly solve that problem it&#x27;s quite likely that the solution would have broad applications across a wide range of domains.</i><p>That&#x27;s an important point. There are many projects besides building a free, online encyclopedia that would need to bring about very similar forms of collaboration, and you are correct that working on the online encyclopedia improvement project will probably turn up knowledge that will be applicable to other projects.<p>AFTER EDIT: Some other comments mention Simple English Wikipedia. But Simple English is a controlled vocabulary, and it&#x27;s not even clear as a matter of linguistics that Simple English is more understandable to second-language learners for general purposes than everyday English carefully written by a sensitive editor. I happened to look at some of the Simple English articles on the topics I research in the last year, after extensive editorial work on the main Wikipedia articles on the English language, and the whole Simple English Wikipedia has an even bigger problem than most versions of Wikipedia with thinly sourced, incomplete articles.",1451428544

Edit warring and vandalism/inserting bias are the norm for these pages. (I do edit entries when I have the time.) Arguably there is no &quot;right&quot; answer that can settle arguments about political topicsand no matter what is written somebody will come along and claim bias and change the wording or delete sections they find objectionable. Pages about less publicized event (e.g Russian-Georgian war of 2008, the Mahar Arar affair) are blatantly slanted to one side or another and stay that way for months or even years.<p>The science articles I have read are sometimes overly technical or needlessly verbose but others know more about that than I do so I can&#x27;t provide examples. If every person who posts a long rant or complaint on an entry&#x27;s Talk page took the time to edit(in good faith)the parts they think need improvement the public would benefit by having access to better quality information. As it stands people put a lot of energy in pointing out, often valid, flaws but very few actually do anything about it.<p>Wikipedia is only as good or as accurate as its editors make it and humans, being the strange creatures we are, have a difficult time agreeing on even relatively basic things so it will always be a work in progress. That it exists is a positive thing overall and to really get a sense of how accurate an entry about a topic you know little about is reading the Talk page is a must.

Had I been alive when that movie was released, I might have been upset about this. However, A New Hope is just one of the most solid coming of age stories there is, and I can&#x27;t fault Disney for wanting to do a soft reboot for a new generation.<p>The film added little new lore since it is mostly a recreation of the original, but I at least do not watch Star Wars movies as a lore hunter. I watch them to be entertained, and TFA delivered in spades. I don&#x27;t feel like Star Wars has ever been particularly strong on lore, so not much is lost in my opinion. In fact, my main disappointment with the prequel films is that they focused more on providing new lore and less on being solidly fun to watch. They provided a lot of great material for Star Wars wikis, but not much else.<p>I feel like it improved on the original in a lot of ways that matter to me personally, but may not matter to others. It might have regressed in ways that matter to others, but not to me.<p>The acting in general was very good, and I liked Rey more than I liked Luke. This is a big deal for me. The actors carried this movie extremely well.<p>I enjoyed the older Harrison Ford more than the younger -- he&#x27;s grandfatherly now on top of all the traits he already had when he was younger.<p>Kylo Ren was a more interesting villain to me than Darth Vader. Not necessarily better, but more interesting. Vader only became interesting retrospectively with the information gained from The Empire Strikes Back and ROTJ. Given only what was known in A New Hope, he was incredibly one-dimensional.<p>Starkiller Base was obviously highly derivative of the Death Star, but it was so visually stunning that I don&#x27;t mind. The film excelled at showing its sheer scale. It was a sight to behold on the big screen in 3D. Any Star Wars movie needs an incredible spectacle, and I think Starkiller Base delivered.<p>This film is probably the first Star Wars installment where none of the humor annoyed me. That&#x27;s a big deal for me as well. I&#x27;m glad that C3PO was featured very minimally here.<p>I could go on, but I&#x27;ll leave it at this.

If I am a self made millionaire (no inheritance, no college, etc) can I then have an opinion about poor people? I think I know your answer, though, and it&#x27;s that nobody actually becomes successful on their own; that we all owe everything we earn to other people, and therefore can never truly take full credit for anything we accomplish. I think people in this world can be very neatly divided into those who share this opinion and those who do not. It might even be <i>the</i> quintessential disagreement between liberals and conservatives (or socialists and capitalists, for that matter).<p>The truth, as always, is that it&#x27;s a very nuanced issue, and we both have valid points. You&#x27;re right about people who inherit all their wealth. They often lack basic empathy for their fellow citizens and lack the understanding that they didn&#x27;t truly earn what they have. And I&#x27;m right that there are people out there who truly do, against all odds, become successful without much help from anyone else.

For residential multi-tenant buildings, state of the art is considered what is specified in class II in DIN norm 4109 appendix 2. that stated a minimum reduction of 55 DB for walls and ceilings under a certain measurement regime, and a maximum level of 25 DB for technical installments in the building, among other things.\nI moved into such a building lately, and most of the times (like now) it is dead silent to the point you can listen to the clock ticking.

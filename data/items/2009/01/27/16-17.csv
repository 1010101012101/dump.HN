452342,comment,452005,452205,0,0,Hoff,,,"Given you don't reference what operating system is in use, you're probably using Microsoft Windows here.  The implementation of virtual memory has common traits, but details vary by OS and even OS version.<p>Physical address space and virtual address space are two different aspects of system design, and it is completely feasible to have these values be the same, or to have either of the two be larger than the other.    Yes, you can have a 32-bit virtual memory system and 34 or more bits of physical memory, and there can be good reasons to do that, too.<p>It's also feasible to have address ""holes"" in virtual address space, and ""holes"" in physical address space.  Address ranges or gaps that are simply not implemented by the particular processor, or that are not instantiated by the memory controller.  But I digress.<p>Save for low-end boxes, all current gear is 64-bit virtual addressing (variously with ""holes""), and most current systems can have 48 bits (x86-64) or 50 bits (IA-64) or other implementation-specific ranges for physical addressing.  Details vary by processor and by implementation.  Available memory varies by budget - 50 bits of memory is expensive - and target market for the box.<p>And consuming address space is different than consuming memory.  On various systems, address space is an inexpensive resource.  And on a virtual memory system, memory is limited by physical memory and by backing storage and by your willingness to wait for the transitions between these two resources; for memory paging to occur.<p>And what your application thinks is in memory might be on disk.  When referenced, the data is valid or is paged in and made valid.<p>Parts of an OS might be memory-resident, and parts can be paged.  Applications tend to be paged.<p>If you're programming in an area that has performance constraints, knowing details of the particular virtual memory and physical memory implementation can be a key to success.  Issues around data alignment, multiprocessor memory caching and data structure layout can all be relevant; having a large and improperly-designed data structure can lead to memory paging for each data structure reference, for instance.",1233074693

It also integrates nicely with JIRA, although I doubt that's used by much of the HN crowd.<p>As for getting people to use it, my team made a rule that if you sent us a question that (in our opinion) belonged in the wiki, we'd answer it there and send you back a link. After a few weeks of doing that, people just stopped asking and went there first.",1233072271

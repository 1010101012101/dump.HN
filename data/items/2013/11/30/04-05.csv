Which means you probably don&#x27;t want to use Google Fonts yet.<p>An outstanding issue [1] for the past few years has been that it can&#x27;t antialias fonts correctly. The results are sometimes just so-so, and sometimes horrible, depending on what version of Windows you&#x27;re running and what settings you have enabled. Small fixes have dropped but the fundamental issue remains.<p>When I first added Google Fonts to my site, I got word from several readers saying text was illegible. Thats when I discovered that tons of other designers had the same issue and it was Chrome&#x27;s fault (search &#x27;chrome windows fonts&#x27; and enjoy). I went back to Helvetica/Arial and every day this issue persists a little part of the designer in me dies.<p>When a company espouses a newfound interest in design [2] [3], but lets a major design issue on the largest platform for their products just sit there (visibly) unaddressed, you get a sense they don&#x27;t have the right people in the right places to get stuff done yet.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Google Fonts, it&#x27;s a fantastic service for the design community. And Google has been building a lot of great design tools [4] that help push the web forward. Just.. close the loop on fonts already.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=137692\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=137692</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016268/google-the-redesign\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fastcodesign.com/3016268/google-the-redesign</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-how-larry-page-engineered-beautiful-revolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/24/3904134/google-redesign-ho...</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webdesigner/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/webdesigner/</a>",1385786748

It seems to me that the things it can do that Google cannot, while technologically impressive, are not particularly valuable to most people.<p>After completing their schooling, most people don&#x27;t need to solve equations every day. If they do, they already have ways of doing it (Mathematica, for example).<p>And most people don&#x27;t need to look up census data, or historical GDP tables, or the location of the ISS. And if they do, they already have ways to do that.<p>Basically, Wolfram&#x27;s approach seems like a great way to organize and make useful knowledge that is fully known.

That is an example of tu quoque.<p>&quot;A simple statement on distaste for the individual is perfectly appropriate, and personal, and many people would agree with you on that one.&quot;<p>You seem to be repeatedly missing the point that many people - including Card - are going far beyond a &quot;simple statement on distaste.&quot;<p>&quot;I am pretty sure if I remember right his words against gay people was at a small conference and then was blown up by the lgbt community.&quot;<p>In fact you do not remember right.  He has written numerous articles advocating for the treatment of homosexuals as second class citizens and even armed insurrection against the government should they treat homosexuals as equal under the law.  You could easily find these articles if you spent two minutes on Google.  They make a lovely companion to his article about how Obama is going to recruit an army of &quot;urban thugs&quot; to do is his bidding.<p>&quot;I see it how it is, Orson Scott Card holds no influence to change laws, the gay movement has won on marriage.&quot;<p>Given the widespread hatred directed at them - which goes beyond mere personal distaste - and the numerous discriminatory laws that still remain on the books around the country, and the fact that there are still 33 states that specifically outlaw gay marriage, I wouldn&#x27;t say that the issue is &quot;won&quot; by a long shot.

6822273,comment,6819702,6820970,4,0,danielbarla,,,"I suspect it&#x27;s due to SO&#x27;s treatment of low-reputation users.  For those who don&#x27;t frequent SO, when you first sign up, you are severely limited in functionality.  So called &quot;privileges&quot; are unlocked as you gain reputation.  Specifically, until his rep reaches 2000 (roughly 200 upvotes to his answers), his edits need to be approved by someone who has a high enough rep.<p>I guess the system works fairly well in preventing spam and gaming of the system.  In this case, it seems to have backfired, leaving an expert feeling unwanted.  BTW, his reputation on SO seems to be around 200 only [1] (around 20 upvotes altogether), which is very low.<p>In this case, the issue is probably two-fold (and serves to highlight some of the imbalances in the reputation system).  Firstly, his area of expertise / activity is less popular than the mainstream ones on SO (lua / luajit only have 5000 questions tagged collectively, which is around 100x less than C#, Java, etc).<p>Secondly, as an expert, his answers probably cater for highly specific, difficult technical problems.  These typically fly under the radar and get a handful of upvotes (unless they show something of interest to the rest of the communities, in which case a perverse upvoting cycle can happen via the popular questions list, with leading answers getting several hundreds of upvotes).<p>Disregarding confirmation bias w.r.t. reputation (i.e. how anything one of the SO super stars says is immediately upvoted), the most popular answers seem to be ones that involve a popular language, address a common misunderstanding / lack of knowledge (usually at a trivial or fairly elementary level), and have an element of surprise to it, which makes people share the answer.  As an example, JavaScript&#x27;s type coercion is always popular, even though it&#x27;s been discussed dozens of times: [2]<p>These two issues, taken together, mean that you could spend an afternoon prototyping some guy&#x27;s difficult problem, solving it, writing up a good answer, and getting only 3 upvotes for it.<p>A similar thing can be said for less populated time-zones; if you&#x27;re living in one, most likely the questions you are answering are not on the &quot;first page&quot; by the time most of the SO world wakes up / has their morning coffee.<p>As an aside, I suspect most reputation-based systems suffer from these effects.  Some of it can be seen right here on HN.  Nevertheless, I guess they work slightly better than having no reputation system, as long as people aren&#x27;t purposely exploiting it.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/1657919/mike-pall\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/users/1657919/mike-pall</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-which-equals-operator-vs-i-use-in-javascript-comparisons\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/does-it-matter-whi...</a>",1385785053

5956671,comment,5956090,5956633,1,0,drawkbox,,,"I&#x27;d argue there are still better games on PC that is open, consoles are really just secondary for the best games.  Yes there are some awesome titles on there but some of the indie ones are just as fun (Fat Princess, Joe Danger).  The better shooters are even still better on PC (Battlefield, Valve games (L4D, TF2), Call of Duty etc etc). With enough time and in a few short hardware cycles the new consoles will be as powerful as mini PCs sitting next to your TV but open markets, then we&#x27;ll see some fun, fun fun.<p>The question is, if id software was a small or medium company today, would they be able to afford getting onto a controlled environment? Would Valve have existed on a closed, publisher happy market like consoles are? (they built off of Quake II)<p>Now there are lots of exclusives and games that are killer on console (Little Big Planet, Halo) but they also have immense budgets. It is not a small/medium sized company playground.  No risks are taken there.<p>I also loved Red Dead Redemption and GTA games but I always have more fun on the PC, so sad Red Dead never made it there.",1372402509

The internet is a <i>big damn deal</i>. But it&#x27;s not a quantum leap as the printing press, steam or telegraphs were. It has antecedents in all those three technological revolutions.<p>The printing press was the first time knowledge could be cheaply conveyed to masses of people without needing someone to manually sit there with the learner and communicate with voice. It totally upended the concept of how individuals could receive their education. It didn&#x27;t replace the university.<p>Steam was the first time that production and transportation could happen faster than muscle power or wind could move objects. It didn&#x27;t cause a meaningful change to the university model.<p>Telegraphs did to thought and knowledge what steam had wrought in the physical world. One could be anywhere on earth and communicate to anywhere else on Earth within the hour. Minutes in some cases. You could use it to form communities of like-minded learners, and people did exactly that. It didn&#x27;t unseat the universities.<p>For some reason, the concept of a vertically-integrated, physically co-located community of scholars and students seems <i>really, really</i> hard to shift. Technologies come along and modify this or that part of it, but students plucked from Bologna in 1088, from Oxford in 1167, Harvard 1636, Sydney 1850 and so on and so forth would find that the modern experience is broadly the same beneath all the pizazz.<p>Students relocate to be near a community of scholars. They pay for access. The scholars read aloud. The students take notes. The scholars test the students and write letters of introduction that verify that the student knows the subject.<p>What has changed throughout that long string of technological revolutions -- technological revolutions that destroyed the universality of the Catholic Church in Europe, revolutions that destroyed feudalism and absolute monarchy, revolutions that totally upended the whole model of the entire world -- is almost nothing. Hardly any damn thing.<p>Given that the internet is new only in <i>degree</i> and not in <i>kind</i>, forgive me for being skeptical that it will do away with such resilient institutions.",1372402323

5956609,comment,5951075,5956441,1,0,aric,,,"I agree with your underlying statement.<p>However, this comes down to semantics now. I contend that altruism is innately human and, of course, common among many animals. Compassion and empathy run deep in the consciousness of many people. Altruism is generally the word used to describe actions based on a sense of compassionate imperative. As such, altruism as a word should be preserved and not confused with contradicting forces at play.<p>The contradicting forces at play are those that would mandate the way in which others act, even if it betrays the ethics of others. That isn&#x27;t real altruism. It&#x27;s artificial. Unfortunately, most people conflate the two as one in the same due to pseudo-liberal (read: not liberating) indoctrination that equates [using force to implore a moral imperative] as being justified by its ends without addressing the means which victimize people and don&#x27;t allow for disassociation.<p>I imagine you agree fully.<p>Altruism is a word that has been perverted and besmirched by multiple sides. Altruism cannot exist in the context of force. Altruism nevertheless exists and it is &#x27;good&#x27; in nature. In other words, no, I&#x27;m not implying that consumerism [needs] to be conscientious. Emphasis on [needs]. [Needs] implies a mandate which requires force. I would imply, however, as a human rights proponent and activist living in a world of governmental and corporate tyranny, that conscientious consumerism is one of the few and best remaining forms of intelligently advocating for one&#x27;s interests and the interests of those who we care about: the people of this world that are often treated like serfs and subjects. Conscientious consumerism is part of the lifeblood of web-of-trusts within free and natural markets. Yes, I would encourage all people (who care about particular issues) to inform themselves and be mindful of the organizations and businesses they directly or indirectly support. I, for one, try not to support abusive companies with policies that noticeably exploit labor and land. Whether this is in my self-interests is merely semantics, for anything I believe and choose is inherently my self-interest manifesting itself through knowledge and action. Power in numbers still exists.<p>Indeed, altruism begins with the &quot;self.&quot; This is another aspect many sides do not fully appreciate. Selfishness and selflessness are words that can possibly be interchangeable and inverted. More people should recognize their own individual self worth. To do so is to also recognize the humanity and self-worth of others. No law is inherently more righteous than the conscience of the individual who must decide whether he or she can morally abide by it. If more people valued themselves in a non-superficial sense, I feel they would be less willing to defer their rights and bodies to the authority of violent groups. Ironically in these words, if more people valued their self worth, I believe that more [selflessness] would flourish: real acts of compassion and community-supporting behavior - acts based on voluntary choice, which we could proudly label &quot;altruistic.&quot;",1372401306

This all leads to insurmountable costs and lessens the chance of successful games.  PS4 has solved lots of this moving to more standard architecture (<a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/189368/Inside_the_PlayStation_4_with_Mark_Cerny.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/189368/Inside_the_PlaySta...</a>) but Xbox you still have to port in DirectX/3d and they all have strange requirements like requiring a publisher in this day and age of self-publishing and open app stores.  Many times these wrappers try to get developers locked into engines and result in older, crappier outcomes. Leading to situations like recreating the string class, threading libraries, graphics libraries, memory managers etc 15 times. All of that focus on tech takes away from gameplay development.<p>So I agree middleware like Unity allow companies to focus on making games rather than building the same tech everyone else is building on each iteration and years of development hours. Building in C/C++ with wrappers is still the way to go and the most portable. Unity uses this underneath, cocos2d-x also have ports of tech, so many tools to help with this now instead of going full custom although if you do go custom it is still C/C++ core, with wrappers and platform specific code for file handling, threads, graphics, audio etc etc.",1372401222

Did the person who made it in the top 4000 of the JEE actually want to pursue engineering at all ? \nI have numerous friends in IITs who join the bandwagon for nothing but the brand. They are clear in their minds to pursue a MBA right after their undergrad (IIT+IIM makes parents, family, girls droool). Then there are people who get into it because of family pressure. Its not a very healthy environment at home for two years at any engineering aspirant&#x27;s home. Trust me.<p>2. What about those people who didn&#x27;t get in ? \nThat feeling of not getting into an IIT can be heart-breaking. Those two years of getting up early and sleeping late, numerous hours spent on mind-numbing problems. Missing family functions and gathering for the sake of your coaching exams. That peer pressure of making it into the next FIITJEE All-India list. Everything in vain ? We live a very black and white life in India. You are either an engineer from an IIT or you are from any-other-college. What about the person who didn&#x27;t get in ? Does this mean that he just isn&#x27;t good enough ? Wait, let me re-emphasis does a 6 hour test get to decide that i am good enough for my dream ? This is unfair. One exam cannot definitely be the make it or break it. Anyone can have a bad day.<p>3. Boards or JEE ? \nFor people who may not be aware, the other exam results which are &#x27;supposed&#x27; to be critical in your making it big in life are the class 12th boards. Deciding in classes 11-12th on what to study for is a major dilemma since the level of the courses are somewhat different. It isn&#x27;t easy going into this thing. The horrendous pattern change in 2013 actually shows how the education ministry is actually using kids for experiments of their own.<p>All said and done. The JEE does a great job bringing like minds together and IITs automatically becomes the hub of the  brightest minds the country has to offer. \nDelighted to see this on HN.",1372400229

The idea is that you have so much competition that games and innovation have to become more fun. On controlled environments that level of competition is not explored because of the high dollar amount needed to play or compete.<p>Game companies like Halfbrick, Firemint, and others wouldn&#x27;t exist without the openness of mobile.  If consoles were truly open there would be games that the bigger companies cannot even risk trying that are immensely fun. PC games allowed anyone in and companies like id software appeared, leading to PC games from Valve as one example. Market determination of good is better when bigger.<p>The internet itself is an example of this.  Would Hacker News exist if there were only 10 publishers of content on the web?  Bigger and more open always makes for better content.  Even if not now, it will shortly.  Games have gotten back to arcade level fun rather than trying to create movies.

Even when I add surplus funds and pay on time, it seems, I get waaay too many invoicing emails from them.<p>I understand these guys are running a subscription service and that they need as high a percentage of on-time subscriptions as possible, but changing payment details are a fact of life, especially when you accept one-time paypal payments.

While I cannot testify for the numbers quoted in the article, which are suspect as other comments have noted, I&#x27;ll share my understanding from about 15 years back when I was one of those students.  Note that I barely have any data in support of this.<p>Many of the students who are able to make it through the IIT-JEE examinations actually do not have to spend as much on the coaching.  There are people who are in the top 2% in terms of their brains, irrespective of the exam, which have a high likelihood of being in the top 2% in the examinations too.  They of course still have to work hard (1) to acquire the needed knowledge, and (2) to gain speed which is also critical via practice.<p>There would be people in the first 2% who do not fall in the second 2% and vice versa.  All the students on the boundary need to work hard to boost their chances as much as they can.  But then there are top 1% (number is made up), for whom chances of slipping outside of 2% would be relatively smaller.  Reality gets more complex of course since it is not just one threshold &quot;in-or-out&quot;, but also about being able to choose the field of one&#x27;s interest after getting in.<p>A whole next class of people are those who believe in themselves a bit more than their real capabilities, because they do not know it just yet.  These are the ones I believe who end up paying the most.  They would gradually see that there are falling through the cracks while still having the desire to get in.  A friend of mine took a bold step, surprising everybody around, by backing out on a timely basis.<p>Finally there are people who would be interested in getting in, but know they do not stand a chance with IIT-JEE.  These better save both time and money and focus on something else, that may include other colleges or other fields of study.<p>Given the reputation of the college, there are coaching institutes which downright abuse the situation.  I have heard of famous coaching centers promising money-back guarantees of making it through, which have their own entrance examination to select students that already have a very high chance of getting through!  I have also heard of similarly reputed centers who would secretly promise a country-wide rank in the top 10 to as many as 50 students (!), again with a money back guarantee.<p>Serving as a single data-point would be my own case.  I did not go to the IIT but to another reputed engineering college [1], but yet the idea is valid.  My total expense for the coaching was about $150 [2], and my four years of undergrad, being subsidized by the government, was about $100 + books [3].  Yes, this is all four years of college, and this applied to ALL students in my college.  Yet, some of my own cousins paid $5,000 to go to a local college of no reputation for a nominally similar degree that ultimately did not get them anywhere.<p>To summarize, the distribution of spending amongst prospective students is somewhat more involved, probably hurting those people the most whose idea of self-worth is not commensurate with reality.<p>[1] That&#x27;s a separate story in itself.<p>[2] None of the numbers here are inflation-adjusted to today from ~15 years back.<p>[3] Books too were generally cheaper Indian editions, so not as costly.",1372399813

That is the justification for the block. The implied task, which typically carries tremendous latitude, is in this clause:<p>> Leadership must establish a vigilant command climate that underscores the critical importance of safeguarding classified material against compromise.<p>Officers will discuss this in an email, maybe during a routine brief, and issue intent (maybe guidance) to the NCOs. That clause about the vigilant command climate being underscored is where the NCOs will be interpreting the implied task(s). Somewhere, for some units, this will be similar to the way alcohol and pornography is handled. There will be an amnesty and then there will be barracks inspections. Platoon and team leaders will treat any device used to access an unclassified system as though it were a thumb drive. Most of the lower enlisted depend heavily upon their Defense Knowledge Online (DKO) portal and webmail. Many use personal computers to access from their barracks. Medical records, address books, professional development, college coursework, all are accessed through the portal. If you have been keeping up on the Snowden leaks on your personal laptop and you are caught with that material on your personal laptop, which you use to access DKO, you will be charged with a security violation. Your clearance will be revoked. You will lose your job and there will be a criminal investigation. If you sync your phone with your laptop, that will be inspected, as well. Your phone might as well be a thumb drive. If you have an email with Snowden material attached to it in your GMail Inbox, and that is pushed to your phone but you fail to report and scrub it, you will be charged.<p>These are marching orders. Soldiers will feel the squeeze from this.",1372399334

So in essence the original beam goes on it&#x27;s merry way unaffected and the duplicate(s) goes into a black box. Though I know very little about this subject I would assume the splitter has to be exact and completely lossless.

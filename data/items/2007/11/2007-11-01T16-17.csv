I guess I felt like I wanted to use the site but did not know what to do.",1193936056

75097,comment,75069,75069,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This privacy/security issue to me is the most important issue of our generation -- especially with the huge datastores everybody is building.<p>As a libertarian, I want to be completely left alone by government. If I act odd then that's my own business. In fact, eccentricity in thought and action are things we should praise, not report.<p>I do, however, understand that there is going to have to be some uncomfortable trades to make the modern world function. A retired politician once asked, ""Nobody wants to record and mine behavior, but lets assume that right now there are five guys in this country with a lethal, contagious disease that they have been trying to spread to as many people as possible. We would really need instant access to everything they've done over the past week or two, and it would be too late to try to pass some kind of law to create a database to get it. Do you collect and mine that information beforehand, preparing yourself to save millions of lives, or do you make the decision that individual privacy is more important than all those lives?""<p>To me it's a tough and complicated issue. At the end of the day, I'm willing to put up with some degree of false positives, even if it involves my detention or arrest if it supports the greater good. False positives are always an issue with any system. The question is whether the current security system is appropriately tuned to the security threat. Does it do more harm than good?<p>Beats me.",1193935662

75095,comment,75044,75077,0,0,corentin,,,"You seem to imply that abstract data types and data structures are in some way similar (or related). It's not the case; an ADT is not a kind of, nor an alternative to, a data structure (and vice versa). They are different things for different purposes, just like an algorithm isn't the same thing as a data structure.<p>I acknowledge that their names can be confusing (both contain the word ""data""). ""data structure"" isn't a bad name; we understand that it's about how data is organized. But ""abstract data type"" is less clear, indeed.<p>edit: I think I found what may confuse you: I guess it's a visualization problem. When you're visualizing a data structure, it probably looks like boxes connected to each other with arcs. And I think your book has nice pictures for ADTs, too (stacks, queues, etc. drawn using boxes and maybe arcs as well). Whereas it's clear that an algorithm is very different from a data structure because it's described using pseudo-code. Forget the graphical representation for ADTs; think of them instead as a list of ""rules"" of the form ""when I dequeue something from a queue, I get the last item that was enqueued"".",1193935554

75092,comment,75045,75073,0,0,zviband,,,"Thanks for the perspective. I believe I've done it backwards, in that I know what skills I have and lack, and what this partner can bring to the table. To me, it's entirely worth splitting the company, as they'll do the lion's share of bringing it to market. What I am interested in is what needs to be put in writing to ensure that I am not giving away half the product, but actually splitting the work, capital required, etc. If I should go straight to a lawyer, then Ok :-)",1193935327

I'm no security expert, but I understand a bit about the field.<p>Not only is the edifice of security extremely inconvenient and abuse-numbing, but it doesn't actually accomplish much of anything. <p>Take a CD. Break it in half. Now you have a plastic knife. The idea that we need to suffer through half measures ignores the most import premise in security: you're only as strong as greatest vulnerability.",1193933334

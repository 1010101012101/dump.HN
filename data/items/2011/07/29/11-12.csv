2821307,comment,2821065,2821065,2,0,temphn,,,"> But for virtually the first time in the history of capitalism, the internet bubble permitted early-stage companies with no tangible assets to raise significant capital based on a plan  but without property, franchises, revenues, patents and certainly no profits.<p>This sounds plausible, but is it actually true? What were the railroad, oil, electrification, automobile, and aviation booms like?<p>Zuck in 2004 had his laptop; Google at the same time had 1e11 dollars or more. But a similar capital difference separates the Wright Brothers' initial contraption from the  cost of the planes made by Boeing.<p>Anecdotally, it seems that many industries got their start with garage scale tinkering. How did those old school entrepreneurs raise the capital to build their businesses, back before VC? Probably has an interesting answer.",1311940792
2821306,comment,2818723,2818723,1,0,asymptotic,,,"I can't comment on Ruby, but as the author decided to throw in a ""...AttributeError in Python"" reference I figure I have two cents to add.<p>Unfortunately the author is out of their depth.  Why are they checking for specific attributes or assuming objects are an instance of a particular class?  This violates the spirit of Python. Indeed, from the Python glossary:<p><pre><code>    (Duck typing is a) Pythonic programming style that determines an object's\n    type by inspection of its method or attribute signature rather than by\n    explicit relationship to some type object (""If it looks like a duck and\n    quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."") By emphasizing interfaces rather\n    than specific types, well-designed code improves its flexibility by\n    allowing polymorphic substitution. Duck-typing avoids tests using type()\n    or isinstance(). Instead, it typically employs the EAFP (Easier to Ask\n    Forgiveness than Permission) style of programming.\n</code></pre>\nThe author even misinterprets the first reference they provide!  How outrageous is that?  The author links to a blog comment as ""These errors are one of the largest sources of bugs."", but the actual link _explicitly states_:<p><pre><code>    The nowhere-near-ready-for-peer-review numbers I've seen suggest that\n    something like 70% of bugs in Java manifest to the programmer as\n    NullPointerExceptions.\n</code></pre>\nThese bugs _manifest_ using some language-specific exception, but clearly the actual bug is a different kettle of fish.  It could be absolutely anything; poorly specified interfaces, well-specified interfaces that are called badly, some lower-level exception getting silently caught, inconsistent state.  What does null, nil, None, NULL, whatever, have to do with this?",1311940785

So going the extra mile to extract oils for slight flavoring is bad, how?<p>Juice is not as good for you as whole fruit. Fine. 20 ounces of any fruit has too much sugar (and would make you shit sideways) anyway. Everything in moderation.<p>If you're going to drink a glass of Oj, which would you rather have, one they deoxygenate or dehydrate? Wholly or partially? I'll personally take deoxygenation over dehydrations. And the fruit juice industry's method for deoxygenation is not, to my knowledge, done via a full nitrogen sparge (bubbling nitrogen or other inert gas through the liquid to lower dissolved oxygen) or via a membrane contactor deaeration system (used in my field, drug dev, and semiconductor applications - check out <a href=""http://liqui-cel.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liqui-cel.com</a>, I've built these systems in a cGMP facility, they're awesome). It's simply vacuuming down the head space in a vat, and <i>maybe</i> replacing it with an inert gas (or just leaving it at negative pressure to reduce soluble oxygen as stated above. I'll take that over an OJ that has more in common with Tang than the fruit that bears it's name, anyway. So what if they tweak the flavor with a bit of ground orange to keep flavor consistent?",1311940634

The people of Finland drastically improved their health metrics when they transitioned to a modern mainstream European diet away from their natural, traditional Finnish diet of lots of red meat and butter.</i><p>Additionally, how does a ""modern mainstream European diet"" compare to a traditional Finnish diet?<p>I've been reading Kristen's blog for a long time.  I don't agree with everything I read, and I tend to be skeptical of strong opinions on either side of an equation.  That said, I can't help but agree with the basic premise of the post: food producers are not entirely truthful about what's in the stuff they produce and we put into our bodies.  And our health and producers' bottom lines do not always line up.  For example, did you know that factory farmed chickens are fed arsenic, and that often ends in the meat you purchase from the supermarket[1]?

2821259,comment,2821063,2821063,19,0,JoachimSchipper,,,"Copy of the text, since it's hard to reach the site itself [any layout errors should be assumed to be mine]:<p>This post was extracted from a small talk I gave at Simplificator, where I work, titled Why I love Smalltalk and Lisp. There should be another post, Why I love Lisp following this one.<p>After I learned my basic coding skill in more or less traditional languages, like C, C++, Python, there were four languages that really tought me something new. Those languages changed my way of thinking and even if I never use them, they were worth learning. They are:<p>* Smalltalk<p>* Lisp<p>* Erlang<p>* Haskell<p>You can probably add Prolog to that list, but I never learned Prolog. This post is about Smalltalk.<p>My goal is not to teach Smalltalk but to show things that you can do with Smalltalk that you cant do with any other language (disclaimer: surely other languages can do it, and well call them Smalltalk dialects). Nevertheless I need to show you some basics of the language to be able to show you the good stuff, so here we go, a first program:<p><pre><code>    1 + 1\n</code></pre>\nThat of course, evaluates to 2. If we want to store it in a variable:<p><pre><code>    m := 1 + 1\n</code></pre>\nStatements are finished by a period, like this:<p><pre><code>    m := 1.\n    m := m + 1\n</code></pre>\nIn Squeak, a Smalltalk implementation, theres an object called Transcript and you can send messages to it to be displayed on the screen. Its more or less like a log window. It works like this:<p><pre><code>    Transcript show: 'Hello world'\n</code></pre>\nand it looks like this:<p>[Squeak transcript showing the result of Transcript show: 'Hello World']<p>The syntax is quite unique to Smalltalk. The message, otherwise known as method call in other languages, is called show: (including the colon) and it takes an argument. We can run it 10 times in a row with the following snippet:<p><pre><code>    10 timesRepeat: [\n      Transcript show: 'Hello world'\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nThere you can start to see how Smalltalk is special. Im sending the message timesRepeat: to the object 10, an Integer. Doing something N times repeatedly is handled by the Integer class, which if you think about it, makes sense.<p>The second interesting part, is the block. The part inside squared brackets. You might thing thats the equivalent of other languages block syntax, like in this Java example:<p><pre><code>    for(int i=1; i<11; i++) {\n      System.out.println(""Hello world"");\n    }\n</code></pre>\nbut Smalltalk versions is a bit more powerful. Its a real closure. Look at this:<p><pre><code>    t := [\n      Transcript show: 'Hello world'\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nNow I have a variable named t, of type BlockClosure, and I can do anything I want with that variable. If I send it the class message itll return its class:<p><pre><code>    t class\n</code></pre>\nand if I sed it the value message, itll execute and leave a Hello World in the transcript:<p><pre><code>    t value\n</code></pre>\nLets see some more code. A message without any arguments:<p><pre><code>    10 printString\n</code></pre>\na message with one argument:<p><pre><code>    10 printStringBase: 2\n</code></pre>\nand a message with two arguments:<p><pre><code>    10 printStringBase: 2 nDigits: 10\n</code></pre>\nIsnt it cute? That method is called printStringBase:nDigits:. I never seen that syntax anywhere else; well, except in Objective-C, which copied it from Smalltalk.<p>Enough toying around, lets start building serious stuff. Lets create a class:<p><pre><code>    Object subclass: #MyClass\n           instanceVariableNames: ''\n           classVariableNames: ''\n           poolDictionaries: ''\n           category: 'Pupeno'\n</code></pre>\nNotice that a class is created by sending a message to another class telling it to subclass itself with the name and a few other arguments. Its a message, a method call like any other. Object is a class, classes are objects. The object model of Smalltalk is a beauty but thats a subject for another post.<p>Now that we have a class, lets create a method called greet: in that class.<p><pre><code>    greet: name\n      ""Greets the user named name""\n     \n      | message |\n     \n      message := 'Hello ', name.\n      Transcript show: message.\n</code></pre>\nIn that method definition first we have a comment for the method, then the list of local variables within pipes (|), and then the implementation, which sets the variable message to contain Hello  and the comma concatenates name to it. Then we just send it to the transcript.<p>It looks like this:<p><pre><code>    MyClass greet method\n</code></pre>\nOk, lets use it:<p><pre><code>    m := MyClass new.\n    m greet: 'Pupeno'\n</code></pre>\nTo create an object of class MyClass, we send the new message to that class. Theres no new keyword like in Java. new is just a method. You can read its code, override it, etc. Dont mess with it unless you really know what you are doing.<p>Actually, if you think about it, we havent seen a single keyword. Look all the code we wrote without having to memorize any keywords! Whats even more important is that by now you essentially now Smalltalk. Thats all there is, but like LEGO bricks, this simple and small building blocks allow you to build whatever you want.<p>Yes, thats it, thats all there is to it. We already saw that Smalltalk doesnt need loops, it has integers and that class implements the timesRepeat: message which allows you to do something N times. There are many other looping methods here and there.<p>What about the if keyword you ask? Surely Smalltalk has an if? Well, no, it doesnt. What you can recognize as an if is actually implemented in Smalltalk using the same mechanism of classes and message passing you saw already. Just for fun lets re-implement it.<p>We starte by creating the class PBoolean and then two classes inheriting from it, PTrue and PFalse.<p><pre><code>    Object subclass: #PBoolean\n           instanceVariableNames: ''\n           classVariableNames: ''\n           poolDictionaries: ''\n           category: 'Pupeno'\n \n    PBoolean subclass: #PTrue\n           instanceVariableNames: ''\n           classVariableNames: ''\n           poolDictionaries: ''\n           category: 'Pupeno'\n \n    PBoolean subclass: #PTrue\n           instanceVariableNames: ''\n           classVariableNames: ''\n           poolDictionaries: ''\n           category: 'Pupeno'\n</code></pre>\nFor the class we created before, MyClass, we define a equals: method that will return either true or false, or rather, PTrue or PFalse.<p><pre><code>    equals: other\n      ^ PTrue new\n</code></pre>\nThe little hat, ^, means return. For now, just a hardcoded true. Now we can do this in the workspace:<p><pre><code>    m1 := MyClass new.\n    m2 := MyClass new.\n    m1 equals: m2\n</code></pre>\nand get true, that is PTrue, as a result. We are getting close but no if yet. How should if look like? Itll look like something like this:<p><pre><code>    m1 := MyClass new.\n    m2 := MyClass new.\n    (m1 equals: m2) ifTrue: [\n      Transcript show: 'They are equal'; cr\n    ] else: [\n      Transcript show: 'They are false'; cr\n    ]\n</code></pre>\nand you can start to imagine how to implement it. In PTrue we add the method:<p><pre><code>    ifTrue: do else: notdo\n      ^ do value\n</code></pre>\nThat method basically takes two parameters, evaluates the first one and ignores the second one. For PFalse we create the oposite:<p><pre><code>    ifTrue: notdo else: do\n      ^ do value\n</code></pre>\nand thats it. A working if! If you ask me, I think this is truly amazing. And if you check Squeak itself, youll find the if is actually implemented this way:<p><pre><code>    True's ifTrue:ifFalse:\n</code></pre>\nIf your programming language allows you to create something as basic as the if conditional, then it allows you to create anything you want.",1311939570

Of course, the more expensive the password-hashing algorithm, the fewer ""similar"" passwords you would reasonably be able to pre-calculate, which is an odd trade-off to have to make a call on.<p>One thing to be wary of, though: by pre-calculating and storing a bunch of hashes of similar strings, this opens you up to (what might be called) a related plaintext attack.

I was like you in HS: got good grades without trying.  I got to college and found that I couldn't skate by, but didn't know how to work hard.  I also didn't feel very engaged.<p>I graduated, and got a job with a smallish (~350 people) public company.  It was interesting, but again, not super engaging.  I got my stuff done, but I wouldn't really say I had a good work ethic.  I spent 5 years there before I finally decided to leave my comfort zone.<p>Then I joined a 5-month-old startup as employee 16.  I was actually passionate about it.

This is the first time that I actually realized that I even <i>could</i> work hard.<p>Of course, that story didn't end very well: I burned out, and the company itself lost its way (in my opinion, though they're still kicking and have at least released a product now).

So, their government has set aside $100M over the next four years to get 1,000 startups to come to Chile for six months and work.<p>But even more than that, their vision is much larger.  They want the program to become a success, so that other, less developed countries start similar programs.  Their goal is to try and convince 10 other governments of developing countries to embark on similar projects.<p>They are trying to hack their economy. And... it's working.<p>I was shocked to heard that their applicant pool wasn't that large.<p>Also, they are willing to take people at the idea stage.<p>So, if you want to build your startup, and take part in one of the best economic hacks I've heard of in years...  apply.",1311938507

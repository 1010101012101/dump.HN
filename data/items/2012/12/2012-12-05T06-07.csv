4875276,comment,4874904,4875045,11,0,btilly,,,"<i>Buybacks usually mean the company thinks their stock is underpriced.</i><p>Everyone gets this wrong.<p>I blame crappy financial journalism for the widespread belief that stock buybacks are supposed to increase the price of the company.<p>According to financial theory, a stock buyback destroys cash on hand and outstanding stock at the same time.  This reduces the value of a company by EXACTLY AS MUCH as it reduces the outstanding stock.  Therefore the stock price should remain unchanged to first order effects.<p>Therefore a stock buyback in theory is just a way of returning money to investors with different tax consequences than a dividend.<p>So all that you should read from ""stock buyback"" is, ""excess cash is available to distribute to the owners"".<p>In this case excess cash is being raised by taking on debt.  But the Modiglianiâ€“Miller theorem also says that the structure of financing of a company has no correlation with its performance, so that shift should not matter much.",1354690386
4875275,comment,4874462,4875188,2,0,OzzyOsbourne,,,"Interestingly, the article explicitly mentions the FBI, not the NSA. But, if we were to unify them in our respective imaginations (for the purposes of discussion), they still need to have the budget for their operations supplied from somewhere. <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fiscal-year-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/fbi-budget-request-for-fis...</a> - it appears as if the FBI's budget is just as rigidly controlled as any other governmental organisation. How they internally allocate the funding they receive is a different matter. To me it seems that if there is any form of oversight within the FBI, then the funding of a project of this cost/return ratio would be infeasible and therefore the project could possibly be shut down. There is the possibility that this is an exercise in propaganda and scare tactics: ""We can read your emails, so don't try anything. Check out our power"". However, because the internal mechanics of the FBI are necessarily not public knowledge this is all speculation and unsubstantiated opinion. But, the argument can be made that this very fact enables the FBI to get away with scare tactics. I <i>still</i> don't see an organisation with the real-world constraints of money being able to store the sheer volume of data that they claim to. For arguments sake, let's assume that the year-on-year rate of email generation remains uniform for the next decade. In one year, they need to have the ability to store X amount of emails. In a decade, they'll need 10X amount of storage. How are they going to store all that data?",1354690380

There's no need to imagine problems.

Whether or not people will use them only in cases where they really don't need any security in their hash (an attacker could cause a denial of service or a slowdown of service by degrading the performance of core data-structures if you use a non-secure hash function against untrusted inputs in the wrong contexts) is somewhat up in the air.<p>That said, it's being used by real applications in production, so the niche is definitely there, but for anything that needs any level of security you should continue using a secure hash algorithm, of which the unimaginably named SHA family provides a good set of standard algorithms.  Using a secure hash every place you need a hashing algorithm unless you <i>know</i> you'll need the extra perf and <i>know</i> you can get away with it is probably a reasonable practice.",1354689299

4875131,comment,4875012,4875012,2,0,lutusp,,,"This is unbelievable. A quote:<p>> Every one is completely random (maximum entropy) without any pattern, and the cryptographically-strong pseudo random number generator we use <i>guarantees that no similar strings will ever be produced again</i>.<p>It's a bit early in your page's text to be lying, especially to a technically astute readership.<p>First, there is no such thing as a ""cryptographically-strong pseudo random number generator"". It's a pseudorandom number generator, and the probability that it will produce the exact same password on the next invocation is the inverse of the word's bit length. That means ""no similar strings will ever be produced again"" is an outright lie.<p>Second, the more results it produces, the more likely that there will be repetitions of prior results. For the reason, read about the birthday problem:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem</a><p>> Every one is completely random (maximum entropy) without any pattern ...<p>False, which is the meaning behind ""pseudorandom"". In fact, the exact same sequence of passwords will be produced by the same algorithm using the same initial seed, over and over again. All a hacker needs to do is find out which of the common pseudorandom number generators is in use, provide the same initial seed, and he has all the provided passwords, arranged in order.<p>Finally, the two claims --<p>1. ... no similar strings will ever be produced again ...<p>2. ... cryptographically-strong pseudo random number generator ...<p>-- represent an obvious contradiction. If the generator produces a high-quality pseudorandom sequence, then <i>ipso facto</i> it must be able to produce the exact same results again. This is a requirement of the provided definition.<p>Moral -- don't let uneducated salespeople write your technical descriptions.",1354687663

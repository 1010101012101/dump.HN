You need non-standard tools to do it, it&#x27;s not as easy as in a typical PC, and occasionally have to hack a firmware update depending on what Mac Pro model and what new CPU you want to use.  The firmware hack is because Apple does not update firmware in older models to support newer CPUs, even though the hardware is otherwise capable of it.<p>I think people who upgrade their CPU in Mac Pros are a minority of Mac Pro users.  I&#x27;m probably not a typical Mac Pro user (a &quot;mid-range&quot; tower would&#x27;ve been fine for me), but I bought a 2007 Mac Pro with the least expensive CPU option, then in 2012 upgraded the CPUs in it to extend it&#x27;s life.  The Xeon CPUs I used were ones Apple never offered, but they happen to work in the machine I had.<p>Also: I upgraded the graphics card several years ago, to an official Apple supported graphics (ATI 5770), but my Mac Pro model isn&#x27;t officially supported by Apple (but it works fine).  I also did a hack to get the current OS X version, Mountain Lion, running on my machine (it isn&#x27;t supported by Apple).  My Mac Pro borders on being a Hackintosh at this point.",1371729564

5911504,comment,5911434,5911434,1,0,garysweaver,,,"> A startup company or startup is a company, a partnership or temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.[1] These companies, generally newly created, are in a phase of development and research for markets. The term became popular internationally during the dot-com bubble when a great number of dot-com companies were founded.<p>> Lately, the term startup has been associated mostly with technological ventures designed for high-growth. Paul Graham, founder of one of the top startup accelerators in the world, defines a startup as: &quot;A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of &quot;exit.&quot; The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.&quot;[2]<p>copied from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company</a><p>[1] Blank, Steve (March 5, 2012). &quot;Search versus Execute&quot;.

Myself, I can&#x27;t think of a single awnser, but then again I&#x27;m the kind of person who learns a programing language or paradigm for fun.<p>However there is an elephant in the room with PHP, it has, quite frankly some terrible creations made by it.  In much the same way MS had a whole bunch of technologies around DCOM and the like which suddenly found themselves disabled and strongly advised against use in XP SP2.  I think PHP really does need to try and clean up its image.<p>The whole &#x27;lets go find some sql injection vulns on github&#x27; game demonstrates many people still use the tool badly.<p>At what point does someone say, that they should re-design the tool, so that they encourage better use.<p>I&#x27;ll be honest, if I hear someone say &quot;we&#x27;re using php for this&quot; I assume its just because they are ignorant of other languages.  I can&#x27;t think of any problem I&#x27;ve been faced with, where PHP is the best solution.<p>So ultimately, if your going to try and remove stuff, why bother, you&#x27;ll only break the existing projects, rather than improve them.

I&#x27;m currently running a couple of Xeon X5560 CPUs, I think they cost 1,600 each at the time.<p>I also buy as much RAM as is reasonable for the box, I started this Z800 on 24GB ECC RAM which was dirt cheap (relatively - as many slots on the motherboard meant I could get lots of the smaller sizes which were cheap). When the price later dropped on the larger modules I upped it to 192GB RAM.<p>As for graphics card... now that is something I upgrade every 2 years or so. I started on a Quadro FX1800 and am now on a Quadro 6000.<p>Aren&#x27;t the names of these things wonderful? You know you get more when the number is HUGE!<p>I think this is basically the norm: Upgrade RAM, upgrade GPU... leave CPU until you replace the whole box.<p>PS: And whilst I&#x27;m here, the Mac Pro is a good design... but for the wrong product. I think this is a new design that is the right design with airflow, cooling and silence in mind and would suit desktop users well... but desktop requirements are not workstation requirements and not being able to replace GPUs is a non-starter. I&#x27;ll skip this design of Mac Pro entirely, or at least until a very wide range of upgradeable GPUs are available. The RAM is also going to be costly, given the few slots available and the higher price for denser modules. I love the design, but this is the wrong class of computer for the constraints that come from the execution of that design.",1371728359

With a guy looking for a &#x27;right&#x27; answer, and it didn&#x27;t go down well when I challenged his assumption.<p>He asked how many plumbers worked in the city, to which I replied you could check the industry registry for qualified plumbers, you can probably filter them out by city. There was silence then I had the question clarified to how many &#x27;plumbing businesses&#x27; where there not individual plumbers.<p>To which I replied you could get the company registrar office but it was impossible to calculate as so many plumbers work full time while also holding businesses of there own as free agents. A very unimpressed look came across the guys face and I was told there is a very simple way to find out and asked to try again.<p>I sat in silence for a 30 seconds or so trying to think of something that would be more thorough than the registry offices, I think offered a few alternatives like tax department records, government statistics office. All things I could think of that would keep fine grained data. But I could see the guy growing impatient with me so I stared at him and asked him what a better metric was than what I had offered.<p>After a few moments I was told the correct answer was to check the phone book, any practicing plumber business would be listed.<p>Startled but what seemed like a completely faulty answer I pointed out what seemed obvious to me... not every business needs to have a public listing... some deal directly as sub contractors ... some could be umbrella companies for subbies ... again some are free agents... some might use unlisted cellphones... not everyone is a legal company, not all plumbers where qualified. It was a terrible way to get a dataset you could rely on.<p>Angry swept across the guys face and I was told sternly I was wrong the data was perfectly suitable, onto the next question... which was all down hill from there as he didn&#x27;t want to hear my answers, didn&#x27;t challenge me back, just rip through the rest.<p>To this day I laugh when ever I think back to that interview.

PHP 6 was meant to be the version that implemented full unicode support, but this proved to be very difficult, with the result that major new features had to go into the 5.x branch while 6.x remained in development (which, I guess, it still is).<p>5.3 added closures and 5.4 added traits, so adding coroutines in 5.5 is not inconsistent with past behaviour.  I guess it&#x27;s sort-of like how every version of OSX is 10.x, even though there have been massive changes between 10.0 and 10.8; it makes more sense to think of 10.8 as being &#x27;OSX version 8&#x27;.  Likewise &#x27;PHP5&#x27; has been around for so long that nobody really looks at the major version number any more.",1371727296

Otherwise, you break string sort, which is more important to us. So if you will never have more than 99 cron machines, use the 01.

Or as python added a whole new syntax for exceptions with 2.6. As with many other languages, incrementing the minor number usually means quite big changes while more or less keeping backwards compatibility.<p>Changing the major number is something that&#x27;s done when backwards-compatibility is hugely affected.<p>The exception is probably ruby which greatly broke backwards-compatibility with 1.9 (unicode) and mostly just changed internals with 2.0",1371726204

Similarly, no brainteasers, but something worse: they made me write syntactically correct code on a whiteboard.  I have never written code without using a keyboard; turns out, I just didn&#x27;t have the neural pathways for anything else.  My brain kinda seized up.  I specifically recall failing to recognise the fibonacci sequence (especially horrifying given that I read mathematics at Edinburgh).  Things went downhill from there.<p>Ever since, whenever I&#x27;ve interviewed someone, I ask them to demonstrate their strengths to me first.",1371726129

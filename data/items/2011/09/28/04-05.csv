I agree with their positions, but I would like to emphasize that college isn't so much about becoming a better programmer as it is about gaining deep knowledge in an _academic_ area (not practical), broadening your knowledge (something you should do if you're only good at programming), a very particular and magical social setting that you will only have access to for 4-5 years after the age of 18 (you never get those years back and if you spend them working, then you missed a chance to have a _unique_ experience. You will be working your whole life. You can only go to college for the first time once.)<p>Studying an academic discipline may seem pointless to you, and that's fine, but if you do decide to go to college, I would recommend that you see it more as a luxury than a means to an end. Try to geek out and enjoy yourself, purely intellectual pursuits are one of the main reasons for living in this world.<p>Two other perks of university:<p>(1) if you get into a good one, people will be more likely to respect your opinion. By good one I mean name brand: Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, Stanford, Oxford, Cambridge, etc. This is perhaps an unfortunate artifact of the transition from a more stratified society to (an even more stratified) meritocracy that may disappear in our lifetimes, but it's very much the case now.<p>(2) you will learn how to write better. This is super important.<p>All that said, there's no reason to go into 100-200k of debt.

I have always been to education institutions where people are generally from around my background.<p>During my pre-university college(10th grade + 2 years, In India) there was a guy who probably couldn't afford engineering. His dad used to work at a automobile mechanical shop. The guy bought a absolute dead discarded engine and built a small airplane with it. The airplane didn't do much. It would just moved around, struggle to take off, loose balance and fall over on the sides. But he was forced to learn so many things on the way. As his classmates we took huge pride in sometimes going to his home and helping him out.<p>Very soon HAL(Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) took note of it, and sponsored his mechanical engineering. He is doing fine now. Generally when someone does something like this, its not for building an actual airplane, but just out of desperation to do something in life. The product is just a way to express what the person wants.<p>This was around 2002, I hope I could show you the photo graphs. I don't think they were taken at that time. Affording a camera was a pipe dream then. But I remember there was a small article somewhere in the news paper back then, that's how HAL noticed it.",1317184247

3046469,comment,3046038,3046038,21,0,flocial,,,"It's a much deeper social problem.  You'd be surprised at the number of potential programmers that went to study law or economics because of the sheer career opportunities you get with this background. You see a lot of engineers that took a roundabout course into the field after wasting years pursuing a different major or regular desk jobs, etc.  People with a good engineering background might be educated in FORTRAN (for hard engineering) by a professor that hasn't programmed in decades.  Hardcore departments (really depends on professor) might give you a good background in C.  In general, it seems the computer science departments are really geared towards creating coding robots more than the big dreamer, tech entrepreneur.  If you miss your chance to get a good job out of college, you'll never catch up to your peers and will more or less be relegated to the ""loser"" group and be lucky to either be job hopping in small venture companies or worse be one of the IT temp workers living in internet cafes (this is less hyperbole than it sounds).<p>Also, while I agree that there are lots of competent coders, engineers just aren't as ruthless about personal productivity.  They'd rather not rock the boat instead of getting into an argument.  There's also the social tendency to take any form of argument personally.  Combined with age-based seniority in programming teams, this kills innovation quick.  A younger engineer with a pulse on the latest cutting edge technology isn't going to be heard at all.  A crusty veteran, will just overrule them and say, ""follow tradition"".  After decades of soul-crushing guess what these once brilliant engineers will say to fresh meat?<p>It would take a lot of courage for a younger, capable engineer to go and rewrite the code of a senior engineer even if it's mediocre, he'd have to be careful even in wording the commit message.  Performance on the job is not rewarded as much as ""competence (meaning just enough to get by but not so much as to make others look stupid)"" and at most you'll rarely get promoted over older employees, you'll just be first among equals in your age group and so will your salary (almost negligible in terms of monetary differentiation, people will just treat you better because you're on the ""fast"" track).

3046462,comment,3046038,3046038,9,0,nourishingvoid,,,"Having worked with a lot of Japanese programmers, this rings true, but I think it says more about how Japanese companies are run than anything else. There are a couple of interrelated factors that come together here. Typical Japanese companies tend to be very conservative in regard to established technologies. Also, lack of timely Japanese-language materials only makes the problem worse. Even if there is official documentation or an O'Reilly book in Japanese, not having the surrounding ecosystem of blogs and tutorials makes it pretty hard to get familiar with a new technology.  Even for mature technologies, the documentation for the newest release or the newest editions of books may not be translated for a while, which further slows things down. Of course, this problem isn't limited to Japanese.<p>At the small Japanese company where I worked there was a pretty stiff resistance to using full-blown web frameworks. The main argument was that it would take too much time to train people to use the framework, and that open-source frameworks were somehow unreliable. So they ended up poorly re-inventing several wheels (like using plain text files and locking for storing data, or a crude templating system) without first checking out the available open-source alternatives. It often felt like we were working at the wrong level of abstraction. On a more practical note, most of our clients used shared hosting with such draconian limitations and ancient server software that it would have been pretty difficult to use some of the modern frameworks even if we'd wanted to. (Think servers with PHP 4 and FTP access only.) I don't think everywhere is as bad as that was, but in my experience not-invented-here syndrome seems to be pretty common here in Japan.",1317183963

When asking whether you ""can do something in the Foo programming language"" this could be a question of theoretical universality or a question of practicality. If it's one of practicality, then it has nothing to do with Turing universality. If it's theoretical, as in ""is Foo expressive enough to describe such and such a computation at all"", then universality matters.<p>Also, from a computationalist's perspective in Philosophy, Turing completeness literally does mean being able to do anything that a single-taped Turing machine can do (such as writing a GUI or writing to a screen). If you a priori disconnect your Turing machine from the screen, effectively eliminating the logical possibility to print to it (or, similarly, you use some pared down language where specific functionality is intentionally left out) then it makes no sense at all to bring Turing completeness into it. It seems like the OP either rejects the Extended Church Turing thesis, or mistakenly thinks that other people lump all possible hardware limitations into Turing completeness. If a language is resource bounded, then it is only Turing complete w.r.t. a Turing machine that has the same resource bounds.",1317182837

I think this is one of those 140 char limit short sound bite problems that often makes the people listening hard to understand.<p>Turing Completeness is about computability, but also implies the functions in that class are able to simulate each other. So ""theoretically"", you <i>COULD</i> write an interpreter in Brainfuck without "","" and ""."" that simulates language L by doing output using some other means, or representing it differently besides printing it out onto the screen. All it has to do is to leave an output state on a Turing Machine.<p>Now the question, when people talk about ""Foo is Turing complete so you can do everything."", is this really what they mean?

3046392,comment,3046038,3046038,3,0,fieldforceapp,,,"Nice post. My time at Panasonic & then later selling software tools to the Symbian OS developers was eye opening to say the least. The Japanese corporate mentality was, in many ways, still feudal. Fujitsu's Symbian OS team was given a lot of support by NTT Docomo but also a crushing amount of responsibility -- they were developing something like 30 baseports a year, 15 each for the Spring and Fall seasons, for all their handsets <i>and</i> acting as lead Symbian developer for the entire NTT Docomo group with little to show for it. Talk about churn & burn.<p>When I spoke to the management about this, they said that they were in a position where they couldn't say no to Docomo and likewise they didn't see anyway of <i>not</i> continuing to do their development. And yet, and no offense to the folks grinding this stuff out, there was little real differentiation in the <i>software,</i> the OEM's were all focusing on the hardware feature differentiation and the software was really just a ""necessary evil.""<p>So I'm not convinced that it's simply a case of needing a ""force multiplier"" framework, the Japanese companies need to see that there's value in cultivating better, highly differentiated software.<p>DeNA, GREE, and the other Japanese social startups seem to have found this whereas the larger vertically integrated semi manufacturers are basically stuck writing drivers for their whizzbang hardware.",1317182436

5778357,comment,5778113,5778113,25,0,jaysonelliot,,,"I like the idea of starting a conversation instead of the usual resume and interview approach, but the example job listing (here: <a href=""http://brookeallen.com/pages/archives/982"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brookeallen.com/pages/archives/982</a>) came off as <i>creepy</i> to me, somehow.<p>Maybe it was the overly familiar tone from a stranger, or the slightly self-centered focus on the prospective employer's own personality, or the paternalistic tone of the listing, down to the closing line: ""deal?""<p>I would personally not be comfortable answering an ad like that. I prefer my professional relationships to at least begin with a more professional tone. Phrases like ""I will not hire anyone until we both understand and care about each other"" remind me of bosses I've had when I was younger that seemed to want to treat me more like a son or nephew than an employee, and it always made me kind of uncomfortable.
I can imagine for a woman, this might set off even more alarm bells than it does for me as a man.<p>Hire skilled, talented people. Looking for ""good-hearted"" people with ""giving personalities"" sounds to me like I'm going to have to hug you at the end of the day or something.",1369720781

Perfect lessons with no delay in empty classes. The school will hum like a well tuned V8.<p>But with their rights, troubles and teenage rebellion - how dare they disrupt the perfect teaching set up by bureaucracy by being themselves.<p>The fact that a survey is needed means that the system has already failed the students. And the idea of it being non anonymous means that the persons responsible have no idea at all how to deal with children. The school is there to guide the young ones during one very hard period in a person's life. It should be relationship based on trust not intimidation. But instead we get administrators that think of themselves as sheriffs that must be tough on crime.<p>But the mantra is protect the children (which we do for ourselves) and not do something good for the children.",1369720765

Obviously blowing up multi-ton statues with explosives and graffiti are two very different activities in magnitude and severity.  Nevertheless, they have many clear parallels.<p>My objection is to your assertion that some people are allowed to express their objection to the art and some people are not.<p>Many ""westerners"" who have never been in that hemisphere, nor have an particular interest in art, objected loudly to the dynamiting of those statues.  Some of them did so anonymously on the internet.<p>Is this okay because that act was more energetic, dramatic, and irreversible <i>(the reason the two acts cannot be said to be equivalent)</i>?  Is it okay for another reason? (I don't know what standard you are using to determine if somebody is <i>""self-righteous""</i>, so perhaps that is the difference to you?)  Or perhaps do you think that it was not okay for ""westerners"" who didn't care about art to object to that act anonymously on the internet?<p>These specific objections that you raised <i>(""westerners"", ""anonymous"", ""don't care about the art anyway"", ""self-righteous"")</i> make much sense to me (you offered them with little to no justification), and I am trying to grok the extent to which you think they are valid.",1369720614

5778345,comment,5777723,5778136,3,0,maarten-pi,,,"I've been to China a few times and I guess you start to get an understanding of why this happens when you're there.<p>The trend is that quite some people have little regard foreach other. It becomes really annoying when standing in line and someone trying to get ahead of you in the queue (there always is someone trying to do it, in crowded places). But don't forget that situations where someone cuts in line will be noticed and remarked upon quickly instead of all the other people who didn't cut in line.<p>I've felt great annoyance about this as well and at one point it turned into some weird kind of amazement where you are observing behaviour from another planet.<p>I've deduced it to a few things.<p>1) The rushed lives in the big cities. The streets are full of people, the roads are packed (it can take up to 1 hour just passing by the 500 meter in front of a busstation with a taxi). People work ridiculous hours there (well some of them) so they are really tired when they move around<p>2) Also taking into consideration the enormous amount of smog / sand storms which pollute the city, you get a place where people just want to get out of as soon as possible.<p>This kind of explains the cutting in line and the spitting.<p>3) The 'one child-policy'. Chinese people tend to take an extreme amount of care of their children and it's not uncommon for parents to go to great lengths just to provide their child with everything it needs. That also goes for spending just about everything they've saved, just so their kid can go abroad to study and find work.<p>In some cases it goes well, but there are a lot of completely spoiled kids around. They actually think they own the world. For a change, I've been to a few more exclusive restaurants and what I found there was obviously good food (they've got that covered), but also young people with an enormous sense of entitlement. Really young, chubby kids ordering waiters to recook their meal, because it wasn't tender enough and giving the waiter all kinds of orders or just people taking off their shoes and put their feet on the table.<p>4) The enormous amount of competition. It's part of Chinese culture for parents to show off their kids and that tradition is largely ingrained in the new generation. People strive to own 4 apartments, a new car, a beautiful wife and a respectable job. This of course doesn't happen to everyone one.<p>Live on campuses is equally hard. Students who want to get somewhere need to study nearly every waking hour of the day from when they are 12 until they graduate from university.<p>The competition leaves people feeling estranged from each other, since there is no time and mental space to actually care about someone else.<p>5) China is mostly a rural country. Almost all parents had something to do with the cultural revolution. That meant pretty much everyone had to do some labor on the country. What we see now is a transition from a rural society to a modern one.<p>Well, I'll stop here. It seems like to me there are a lot of factors in play on why the Chinese do the things they do.<p>I guess it's mostly a state of transition (and I hope), I've seen great things happen in China. And well, with that many people there not all goes well.",1369720606
5778343,comment,5771061,5773503,1,0,lsc,,,"well, just taking an image and throwing it somewhere is pretty easy (takes a bit of disk/network bandwidth, but it's not hard, if you have enough of those)<p>If you are short on disk/network bandwidth, the 'snapshots over the network' capabilities of things like zfs can help, while still remaining fairly simple.<p>hell, plain old rsync can work pretty well, and helps a lot with network bandwidth, even if it doesn't help so much with disk bandwidth.<p>And yeah, just taking disk images (or even tarballs) and stashing them somewhere cheap is a good start.   much better than nothing.<p>Now, the downside to untested backups?  when you need the data, something always goes wrong and it becomes this huge emergency that you have to deal with <i>right now</i>  -  and sometimes?  even if you do everything right from that point on, the data is just gone.<p>I mean, that's a fair tradeoff a lot of times;  if everything goes well, you've put little effort into backups, but you are still at a point where if something goes wrong, you can work hard and probably get your data back.  I mean, yeah, you still have a reasonably high chance of losing everything, but your chances of recovery are way better than if you have no backups, and the effort level (if you don't need the backups)  is not that much higher than no backups.<p>The thing is, the original subject was people who didn't want to deal with backups.  ""Oh,"" I thought, ""Why don't you pay me to worry about your backups?""  If I'm going to accept money from you to manage your backups?  well, I have to set some expectations.   most people aren't going to want to pay very much for untested backups, 'cause it really isn't that much work, until the excrement intersects the turbines, at which point it's a giant emergency, and a huge amount of work.  At that point, I'm in a position where some $10/month customer is expecting me to do a couple grand worth of work;  I mean, as a $10/month customer, I have never seriously looked at your app before.  I've gotta restore from a backup that was taken without thinking about how your app works and make it work when I don't even know what ""working"" looks like, so it's going to be a lot of effort.  Either I do it for free and I'm unhappy, or I hit them with a huge unexpected bill, and they are unhappy.  (well, a $10/month customer, generally speaking, simply isn't going to pay a multi-kilobuck bill, and this is easily several thousand dollars worth of work, so in that case I'm unhappy <i>and</i> they are unhappy.)    I try to be careful about setting expectations that I can actually meet, and I try to only accept customers who will be happy with a service that I can actually provide.  -  So yeah, while I think untested backups are a fine first step, and might even be what makes most economic sense for most people, configuring untested backups is not a service I would be willing to provide.   If that's what you want, do it yourself.<p>However, if I put more effort into a tested recovery procedure up front, and more effort into testing that procedure in a routine, verifiable way ongoing? Sure, a lot more effort is being spent, effort that didn't need to be spent if nothing goes wrong, and I'm going to charge you for that.   It will be more expensive.   But I'm charging you a predictable amount; you knew what you were getting into when you signed up, so you aren't so unhappy.   Then, in the unlikely event of a water landing?   It's really not that big of a deal;  you've been paying your monthly dues,  I know the basics of your system, I've set aside some spare hosting resources, and I feel okay about getting woken up to make sure your restore goes okay, and the restore probably will go okay.   I mean, it'd cost more money up-front, but it would set expectations in such a way that those expectations could be met.<p>My break is over;  I need to get back to dealing with one of those giant emergency situations caused by a lack of tested backups... on one of my systems, in fact.",1369720581

5778328,comment,5777578,5778244,7,0,rdtsc,,,"Interesting take on it. I attribute this more to their incompetence and plain 'ol stupidity. I imagine people who can think better in general don't aspire to be school administrators. Some teacher perhaps love teaching kids and are dedicated, administration and bureaucracy attracts a special breed of people... and let's just say that these are not usually the brightest either. But what they have learned and do well is protect themselves. The constant threat or funding withdrawal from the govt, the threat of law suits, the threat of reputation if say a student goes ""mental"".<p>They have nightmares of being on the stand in court and asked  questions like ""are you sure you did everything you could to prevent the disaster?""...At least this is probably how testing and psych screening company sold them the packet.<p>Now their stupidity is also a blessing. If just someone could manipulate them into being afraid of your scenario. Being sued for collecting too much private info about its students. What if they get hacked or someone breaks into the office and steals all those answer sheets with all kinds of strange confessions? Law suits from parents is supposedly this dark deep evil always lurking in their minds. Just need to re-frame the problem so that they see collecting data = increasing risks of getting sued and voila, temporary win.<p>As a side note, someone on Reddit mentioned taking a similar test (but supposedly anonymous, I say ""supposedly"" as teacher often can tell the students by handwriting). and putting the most outrageous answers they could in the boxes, mostly for fun. I realized I would have probably have done back then the same thing, just to mess up their statistics. What if didn't end up being anonymous, it leaks and now it is attached  to my name for life.

Create a unique password and retrieve it using a password manager.""<p>For one, I'd consider that bad business. If you want to make money, it's not a good idea to declare to users that your system is insecure.<p>More importantly, you're now putting all the responsibility on the user. Yes, it's good for users to think about security. Yes, it's impossible to 100% guarantee the security of your users' passwords. But disclaiming all responsibility? We're the ones with more technical knowledge, not our users. We should bear as much of the burden of security as we can.<p>> Password hashing is a losing battle<p>Your argument here seems to boil down to the idea that GPUs are now capable of cracking any password hashing scheme we have, assuming weak passwords. My understanding was that this was not the case, but perhaps I'm wrong. As far as I know, you can set the difficulty factor in Bcrypt high enough that it's impractical to crack on any commodity hardware.

However the marketplace is very liquid you will also almost always find that there is actually someone at the other end, so when you get 10 bids in 60 seconds if you start to chat there is a human at the other end. We get almost 1 million bids per month now. No other marketplace on the Internet comes close to liquidity (about 950k/mo now). This is great for finding people quickly and getting the right price for your project.<p>2) Well 5 billion people on this planet live on $8 day or less, I think you can't say just because someone is willing to work for 2-3 days for $30 they are automatically ""bad"".<p>3) Labour arbitrage is something we are looking at. It usually does not result in lower quality, quite the contrary, because the guys doing the arbitrage (flipping projects) need to retain a high reputation score or they will blow their accounts up and the business model will stop working. Right now they are acting as quality and customer service managers so they actually enhance the result for the end user.<p>4) Yes I absolutely agree, and we are looking into how this can be done better.<p>Regards

If you send me an email I can look into your accounts and see if I can make a recommendation for you, if you like (my email is easy to guess @freelancer.com).<p>Re/ sub-accounts, we are looking at this, the actual use on vWorker was very low (less than ~500 users out of 2.5m). This is why we haven't implemented yet. We are looking at it, however.<p>You are mixing up the Freelancer leveling system with reputation. Reputation is completely distinct. Reputation is simply volume (dollar) weighted ratings on a per category basis. Thus the highest rated, most paid freelancers are at the top of reputation for a given skill. The gamification system is completely distinct and has no influence on the bid list, this is purely like a frequently flyer program in giving back perks to users who are good on the site (as distinct to those good at work).<p>Yes, we are a much bigger marketplace than vWorker. So there are more bidders, but also substantially more projects. We do have projects that are well over $250,000 on an ongoing basis.<p>No platform charges 2%. vWorker charged 15% flat. You can get down to 3% on Freelancer, the lowest commission in the industry for $49.95.<p>If you get in contact with me, I will see how I can help.<p>Regards

Certainly, his method of argument--describe the technique, show a vulnerability the reader might not have heard of--could be applied to both password hashing and random numbers.<p>I realize, however, that you have a more charitable interpretation of what the OP was suggesting. I think you and I mostly agree about the substantive issue: Crypto should be used, but as you said, developers owe it to users to make it work. My disagreement isn't with you but with the OP and others who seem to suggest tossing aside crypto because it's too hard to get right.<p>I just realized I haven't proposed a positive alternative to the ""don't use crypto"" meme, though. I honestly don't know what the answer is, I'm afraid. Realistically, lots of devs need to use crypto, and we can't all develop your level of expertise in that area. (The founder of a security consultancy will always know a lot more about security than generalist app developers. Only so much time in the day.)

5778192,comment,5774588,5776980,1,0,dpatru,,,"Profit simply means that an activity is worth it: that the result will be worth more than the costs to reach the result. Profit is the aim not just of corporations, but also of government.<p>For example, a government should not build a road unless the people using the road will collectively save more in transportation costs than the costs to build the road.<p>The problem is that for many projects, the net benefit is unknown at the start. In the road example, before a road is built, it may not be clear how much it will cost to build a road nor how much people will save from using the road. The best we can do is try to estimate.<p>But just because we have to estimate doesn't mean that we ignore profit. Before a project is undertaken, we should still try to figure out if its worth doing. We just can't be sure.<p>When we say that government funds ""risky"" projects, this can mean that the projects have a high probability of failure but are still worth funding because the probabilistic expected payout is positive, or that the projects are really not worth funding because we really expect that there will be no net benefit. If we're talking about the first, then the private sector will fund it without government. For example, YCombinator routinely funds companies that have a high probability of failure. But overall it expects a positive payout. So startups get funded.<p>But if we're talking talking about the second type of risky, as in no expected return, then really no one should be funding these projects. Why should the taxpayers take risks collectively that no one is willing to take individually?<p>It doesn't make sense for an individual to try to fund retirement by buying lottery tickets, no matter how much money they spend. Therefore, government should not be trying to fund government pensions by buying lottery tickets.<p>In practice, governments seldom openly advocate investing in projects with negative returns like a lottery. They propose funding projects that the private sector won't fund. But even if a project is expected to be profitable, it still should not be funded at the expense of projects with higher expected profit. And because we have limited resources, the funding of low-expected-profit projects means that other higher-profit projects can't be funded.<p>Again, I refer you to Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson, chapter 6 this time: <a href=""http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/chap06p1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/chap06p1.html</a>.",1369717666

And no one knew he was there?<p>again, very trivial story. there is an argument to be made that how plausible it is for OBL to live in hiding in Pak but lets for a second we assume that Pakistan were providing a lovely cushy place for him to hide. The reasons are not Islamic, cultural, brotherhood ..it's plain old foreign policy. The war in Afghanistan brings aid and modern technology to Pak Army. And they are suckers for that. Our Army did the same when you guys funded Afghanistan in Russia war (and guess what they build a whole Atomic bomb out of it) and they did the same this time. Nothing to do with your grand illusions of how Islam runs thing here. It's all money. The generals will spend there weekend drinking & dancing (again banned in Islam!) to celebrate there achievements.<p>---<p>and as for all your other points which is basically how Islam is hindering progress in Afghanistan: so at least you started with Islamic countries and then narrowed it down to the failed ones and now we are in Afghanistan only. So I'll say that's good progress. You can't compete me on Pakistan on details but you can't do that for Iran, Afghanistan or any other Islamic country. And these are not some hidden research which I did. You only need to visit the country once & meet with common people to understand how your nice little good (democracy) vs evil (religion) doesn't fit. It'll be an eye-opener.<p>Yes..Islam covers every aspect of life but the number of people who follow Islam like that are less than 0.1% of the world population. And I've given you gazillion examples of that (heck! we have a bigger red district area in Lahore than Amsterdam). Afghanistan was fairly happy with their system a few decades ago. They had universities, tourism, working-women ..all sweet. But then the Russia war happened & it's been downhill since then. Have you ever talked to an Afghani all your life? I can only assume no. Your total knowledge seems to come from watching OBL/Taliban released video speeches.<p>And I can't even fathom how you think Iraq learned the lessons.

There are definitely limitations in what the design allows you to do, but it's more powerful than anyone gives it credit for.  It'll also be cathartic to share how I made the AES and Mersenne Twister spreadsheets.  (Spoiler: The C preprocessor was involved.)<p>That said, I don't think the Matasano people have to worry about me solving more problems in Excel.  Programs that I could bang out in five minutes in Python turned into all-day, profanity-laden affairs with Excel, which turns Excel into a distraction from the crypto stuff.<p>Also, if anyone decides to give Matasano's crypto challenge a try, it's a great opportunity to learn a new programming language or a great excuse to get better at a programming language that you don't know so well.  My Python knowledge was pretty minimal at best (the only languages I've ever really cared about are C, Fortran, Perl, and <i>[spit!]</i> PHP), but now I'm <i>much</i> more comfortable with it.  In fact, if I ever finish, I might go back and redo everything in Ruby just to learn Ruby...",1369717452

Jews are not similar even by  their religion. There are ultra -orthodox anti-zionists, there are atheists, there are north African Jews, Asian Jews, Eastern European Jews etc. all have different traditions and probably are more similar to their immediate social group than to each other. Even worse, Israelites don't like American Jews (eg loud, vulgar and obnoxious), which is probably what this stereotypical and horribly simplistic description is based on. So please, lookup racism or at least antisemitisim before writing such a piece (a 'positive' twist does not make it less of a stereotype, and those are dangerous).",1369717414

As the article mentions Soylent is currently expensive.  Their crowdfunding level was food replacement at about $7 per day.  That's way outside the range of the 20% of the world population living on less than $1.25 per day.  The main ingredient of Soylent is water.  Unfortunately, about a billion people do not have access to clean drinking water.<p>Hopefully with mass manufacturing they can get the cost down.  And they could plow back some of the profits into providing clean water.<p>There are other worrying things about Soylent.<p>> <i>For anyone who struggles with allergies, heartburn, acid reflux or digestion, has trouble controlling weight or cholesterol, or simply doesn't have the means to eat well, soylent is for you.</i><p>> <i>Soylent frees you from the time and money spent shopping, cooking and cleaning, puts you in excellent health, and vastly reduces your environmental impact by eliminating much of the waste and harm coming from agriculture, livestock, and food-related trash.</i><p>From (<a href=""https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body"" rel=""nofollow"">https://campaign.soylent.me/soylent-free-your-body</a>)<p>Lots of 'problems with digestion' are going to be serious illness for which liquid feeds are used.

As the article mentions, milk proteins are significant impact.<p>Soylent also claims to have a shelf life of years.  I'm still very curious about this.  Many micronutrients will not have a shelflife of years.  vitamin C needs to be kept in the dark, in an airtight container, away from heat and moisture.<p>It was a mild irritant when it was one guy experimenting on himself (but giving out the recipe for other people to follow along).

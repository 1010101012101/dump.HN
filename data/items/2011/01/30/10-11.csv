The idea that the BBC is any more ""truthy"" than any other news source is laughable; they're all run by humans after all. And the BBC recruits most of its staff through one route, the media section in the Guardian, which no-one would claim is anything other than a left-wing paper. It could, for example, balance it out by recruiting 50% via  the Graun's big rival, the Daily Mail, but it doesn't.",1296384990

2157820,comment,2155630,2156678,0,0,Aegean,,,"You don't really have to have networking or files to write programs. Currently in a baremetal embedded system (I am including the RTOSes) you can write programs in C or C++. It would be very useful to be able to write programs with a main() function using python. You could write an interactive shell, device drivers, even a small operating system.   So what I mean here is instead of aiming for applications, you could use python to write system software.<p>I think there are already lua interpreters ported in this way but python is more common and perhaps easier to use.",1296384895

2157808,comment,2157157,2157157,0,0,antirez,,,"Suggestion for creating a startup:<p>For private repositories gitolite is really awesome, but I think there should be a company about it. What I mean is that github or some other company should offer hosted gitolite instances, in the following form:<p>You pay something like price_of_small_linode_instace+price_of_service, to get:<p>A virtual machine with gitolite up and running, with a good web interface and online documentation. I think that the web interface part is the piece this company should <i>not</i> opensource. With this web interface you can create repositories and users, and modify the gitolite settings in general.<p>A backup service, in some other different VM and network, so that if something goes wrong with your gitolite VM you can ask a free (and automated) restore, possibly with hour granularity for the latest 24 hours, and less granularity for bigger periods and so forth.<p>Note that this gives the user virtually infinite repositories... if they don't upload movies to their instance, as there is a lot of space even in a small linode instance for git repositories.<p>This way this is a ""pure product"" as there is no need to repair or install manually virtual machines, and the company can focus into evolving the offering, developing a better version of gitolite, of the web interface, and so forth.<p>p.s. I mentioned linode but can well be ec2 or whatever is better suited for this stuff.",1296384338

Hail the great cost-cutting measures! Except the government will still be putting the same amount of money into the labs andyway; we've been getting emails talking about how they're now trying to come up with ways to spend this windfall of excess cash. So far it sounds like they're going to go for some pseudo-green initiative; maybe we'll just get a new Greenification Department, which inspects all of our workspaces and penalizes us when we're not green enough. (This particular pay freeze is because Dr. Chu wants to make Obama look good. Good policy for a Democrat, screw the researchers but keep the $2 million salary for the head of the lab... wait isn't that what Republicans are expected to do?)<p>The talk about an across-the-board 10% cut made me think of that--unless it's specified that employee wages and benefits must not suffer, such a cut will probably just end up boning the minions.",1296382686

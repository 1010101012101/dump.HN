Worse yet, you assume that software projects, startups etc. are all big accomplishments. Just like becoming famous perhaps. Or amassing a lot of stuff. That&#x27;s a recipe for disappointment and failure. Take a step back, breathe, analyse what it is you really want. And if you want to define your self worth with such things.<p>Imho, society, in my case: software development culture, (to some extent) is sick. Many of us probably believe we need all to be Mark Zuckerbergs or Elon Musks. Insanity. I suggest you take a step back and find out what you really want. Perhaps a time off for centering yourself might be a good suggestion.<p>Someone said: A lack of ambition is a wonderful thing. That&#x27;s probably true. Please relax. ;)",1428487188

More and more startups these days are choosing to be acquired. The edconomictimes.indiatimes.com has interviewed prominent venture capital professionals for their take on this phenomenon.<p>&quot;Founders do give up at some stage,&quot; says Saurabh Srivastava, co-founder, Indian Angel Network. &quot;Globally, very few founders take a company from start to initial public offering (IPO)”<p>For most founders, the realization that they can&#x27;t scale comes very early,&quot; he adds. Fantastic entrepreneurial success passes into folklore; but not so the nine out of 10 startups that don&#x27;t go public. Studies show that less than 1% of startups go on to public listing. There were 738 venture capital (VC)-backed exits and 637 VC-backed M&As in the US in 2014. Less than 50 made it to the IPO stage. Most startup founders prefer to merge with or sell their companies to larger corporations.<p>&quot;An entrepreneurial journey is very personal,&quot; says Niren Shah, managing director, Norwest Venture Partners. &quot;There&#x27;s a thing in Silicon Valley,making your first $1 million. Many just give up at that stage rather than go on to become very large companies,&quot; he adds.<p>Valerie Wagoner, founder of ZipDial,  which was recently acquired by Twitter, echoes this statement : &quot;Given Twitter&#x27;s ambition in India and emerging markets, our team and platform can achieve more, faster and at a bigger scale by being part of Twitter.&quot;<p>Vikas Saxena, co-founder of Nimbuzz, which was recently bought over by New Call, agrees: &quot;New Call telecom shared a bigger vision with us.

9339663,comment,9338408,9338408,0,0,MCRed,,,"Since Agile became a buzzword (and before that &quot;Extreme Programming!!1!&quot;) about 14 years ago, I&#x27;ve never seen it work right.  I&#x27;ve never seen either of these have a net addition to the performance of the team.  2 developers pair programming don&#x27;t get new features done twice as fast. (though it&#x27;s great for fixing a bug or transferring knowledge for a particular piece of code.)<p>Daily standups have never been beneficial.  I see people here talking about managers not talking during standup.  I&#x27;ve never seen that once in the past 10 years that &quot;SCRUM&quot; has been the buzzword.  NOT ONCE.  I&#x27;ve never seen standups that were only 15 miutes.  After being forced to stand for 20-40 minutes each day listening to an air headed project manager drone on during the Standups at Amazon, I vowed I&#x27;d had enough.   I got tired of having my time wasted and made a rule that if I can&#x27;t sit down during a meeting, I&#x27;m not attending.  If you think I&#x27;m rambling in the meeting, then you can make me stand up, but I&#x27;m never the problem (always the &quot;product manager&quot; or &quot;biz guy&quot; is the problem. Talking seems to be what they think is the purpose of their job.)<p>It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I associate the word &quot;scrum&quot; in job postings as a red flag.<p>Teams should work asynchronously, all the time.  Git lets us code async.  Slack and Hipchat let us chat async.  Whenever we need to coordinate, we just talk.  (which is why you need offices so your talking doesn&#x27;t bother other people.) Otherwise, everything should be async.<p>A standup is a big old pointless nose-counting exercise.  It feels like it comes from the 1950s.<p>And if you&#x27;re having a daily standup at 10am, then that means I can&#x27;t start work at noon, can I?  So, where is this &quot;flex hours&quot; that everyone thought was such a good perk 10 years ago?",1428486848

So I thought I&#x27;d offer some perspective on where this actually comes from (from a sample set of 1).<p>PHP&#x27;s documentation is almost too good.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  My primary frustration dabbling with other languages is that no-one else has not only the language itself, but a huge subset of the core library documented to the standard that I&#x27;ve come to rely on from PHP.<p>But here also lays a huge problem.  I&#x27;m not a programmer.  I have next to no idea what MVC is, let alone what would qualify it as sensible.  When it comes to architecture, I could give you a much more convincing description of flying buttresses than anything you&#x27;d hope to find in a codebase.<p>But what I can do, is break what I want to do down into small enough component tasks that I can find very workable examples within the PHP documentation, and then duct-tape these all together until I&#x27;ve accomplished my goal.<p>Now, the good news is that I know this is a terrible approach with terrible results, so I wouldn&#x27;t dream of inflicting my results upon anyone else.  But I thought I could offer a little insight onto how PHP enables such atrocities.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the popular backlash against Bootstrap.  Where Bootstrap enables me to kludge together a frontend with near no idea what I&#x27;m doing, PHP&#x27;s documentation does the same for the backend.

(If you make at least 30k Euro you get a work permit immediately. If not, just ask for asylum and you get better benefits than most pensioners.)  It could abolish export financing and government guarantees for export financing.<p>2.

Germany is not creating a buffer, it is exporting both, capital and goods. She does dumping with salaries for engineers and exports like crazy. She has too, since there is not enough money people can spent in Germany since the salaries are so low. At the same time, &quot;Germany&quot; is not getting any financial buffer. She gets Lehman debt obligations and Greek government debt. Germans take pride in being the leading exporter of goods. They better would take pride in &quot;giving away products for free&quot;. But in fact, there is someone profiting: Private, highly export oriented enterprises. And there are three kinds of people footing the bill:<p>1. Employees that are highly underpaid.
2. Tax payers that will have to foot the bill for the bail outs.
3. Citizens that see there infrastructure, universities and public services crumble.<p>In short: Germany is exporting itself to death.<p>3.
> What books would you recommend for a complete newcomer to learn about macro economics?<p>Hm. Hart to say. There are so may. Mises, no matter what you think about him, is good for an introduction.

9339595,comment,9338246,9339306,0,0,laumars,,,"If I remember correctly, NeXT was largely bought for Steve Jobs rather than NeXTSTEP. Also the iPod and the iPhone (or rather the iPad, as that was what Apple were originally working on before they miniaturised it and released it as a smart phone) was Jobs&#x27; concept. Obviously prior art existed, but the digital music player and tablet markets were pretty underwhelming to the average layman before Apple released their products.<p>So I don&#x27;t think Apple&#x27;s business would have exploded like it if they bought Be Inc. However Be&#x27;s core business was multimedia (like Apple&#x27;s was per-OS X) and that industry has since felt a little neglected by Apple as they seem to be concentrating more on gadgets than power users. So if I had to speculate, I&#x27;d say Be Inc / Apple&#x27;s business would have grown with the media industry and stayed more faithful to their core users.<p>I also think Apple would have consumed more of Linux&#x27;s market share than it has done now because an Apple owned BeOS would still have retained, at least, partial POSIX compatibility meaning the leap from UNIX / Linux would be equivalent as it is now, but there would have been less fanboyism which was largely drummed up by Jobs to increase sales. I think, perversely, that has put many new users off from migrating to Apple from the FOSS community who want to use an open API without the corporate BS.<p>Lastly, I think Macs might have become the de facto standard web developers machine. Partly because of being more true to it&#x27;s core multimedia business (and the web now being as much a multimedia platform as any other these days), partly because of it&#x27;s POSIX compatibility meaning it would be trivial to run the same Linux / OS X develop tools, partly because of it taking business from Linux (see above), partly because I think Apple would have continued to allow 3rd party manufacturers to build Apple-compatible machine (IIRC that was one of the first things Jobs terminated when he rejoined Apple), and partly because Windows users would feel less threatened making the switch (BeOS always felt a less significant paradigm shift from Windows than OS 9 / OS X did).<p>So in short, I think OS X would have had a greater market share if Apple bought Be Inc, but I think Apple would have been less successful as a company since their biggest market at the moment is consumer gadgets (specifically the iPhone).<p>This is all just guesswork, obviously.

9339594,comment,9337863,9337863,0,0,erikb,,,"A few points I haven&#x27;t seen while scrolling through the comments:<p>1. Impact of Achievements does not relate to time as much as we think. Someone can start with 50 and make more impact than the most talented programmer made in 30 years of hard work. Maybe you need 2-3 years to get up to speed, but for longer time periods there are too many other factors involved. So if you are really as good as you think (most programmers do, but we can&#x27;t all be better than all the others) taking your time and working on something that is interesting to work on might be more interesting than a comparison with a guy 10 years younger.<p>2. Start small. That is even more true for side projects. Do a very tiny thing. Then you can finish it. And if you have more motivation add a second small thing to it. This way even if you lose some motivation you still have something to show for it.<p>3. Code on something you need. I&#x27;m certainly a below average coder, but my best side project is something that started without planning because I wanted to automate a tedious task of mine. I&#x27;m working on it from time to time for years now and gradually it becomes more and more useful and nice to use. It&#x27;s not on Github. It might not help anybody else. But I&#x27;m really proud of it, and it really helps me a lot on an almost daily basis.<p>4. That also means the code itself has no value, but what the program helps you do has value. If you don&#x27;t code something that does something useful, than your project is meaningless. And by far the easiest person to please is yourself.<p>5. The most valuable programmers and the ones who have achieved something in the eyes of the public are not the same. Your mother might think Steve Jobs must have been a much better programmer than you. But he&#x27;s not even a programmer at all. Public recognition is not what we think it is as 20 somethings.",1428485688

So they just didn&#x27;t play. But we all start back at 0 when we do something new. We progress faster the second and further times around.

The turtle, not the hare. I think the turtles do more good over their lifetimes than the hares, and that people who continue to be productive year in and year out are much, much happier.<p>My fears now are a different sort: do I still have time to accomplish the things I want to accomplish? Then I remind myself that I still have another 30 or 40 years of work left, as much in front of me as behind me. I encourage you to think that way: you have another 60 years of work left...what can you do over the course of 60 years?

It made me realize that I am externalizing my happiness, that I am comparing myself to others when such comparison is not fair,that whoever I am comparing to might have problems of their own; nobody&#x27;s life is perfect. But most importantly it made me realize that all my adult life I have been preparing to be happy without actually being happy. It&#x27;s like this. If I do this project and publish my web app, I will be happy. Or if I conrtibute x-lines to some OSS and get my name on the contributers list, I would be happy. It was sort of like preparing your bed but never actually sleeping in it. So the TL;DR is start with a little bit of meditation.The Art Of Living Sudarshan Kriya and mindfullness would be my humble recommendations.",1428483800

It looks almost like a reference section at a more traditional library, except it&#x27;s just for teens to hang out in. It too has it&#x27;s own dedicated section.<p>- A cafeteria-like snack, study area. More tables and desks for study. Only you&#x27;re allowed to eat and drink in this area.<p>- The rest of the library looks like a college study area, desks with power, comfortable lounge chairs by bright open windows<p>- Periodicals and magazines are next to an open air, casual reclining spot.<p>- Well staffed info desks are impossible to miss. They even have teens volunteer to staff special teen desks.<p>- They have a bank of computers for people who need to use one.<p>- They host numerous events through the week, from minecraft clubs to retrogaming clubs, reading groups, guest lecturers, authors, puppet shows, story time, gardening seed exchanges, lego builds<p>- High speed free wi-fi<p>- robust support for e-book readers, tablets, streaming music, emagazines, all from the county website.<p>I&#x27;d like to compare it to something else, but I can&#x27;t really think of anything that&#x27;s <i>quite</i> like it, and it&#x27;s amazing.

I don&#x27;t use other features on your blog. Please just serve me the content and don&#x27;t try to SPA that shit. Heck, I&#x27;d be willing to bet 99% of websites out there don&#x27;t need to store session information to begin with - a static website would have served as well.<p>And most interactions on any website are not worthy of making it webapp-y anyway. Most websites with interactions will do well with minimal interactions anyway. Not every website needs to be real time. The existence of a listening loop in a lot of websites has caused my MacBook to crash more than I can care to count.<p>OK, sure, webapps like Asana and Gmail have good reasons to use and push the use of JavaScript forwards, but I really don&#x27;t see why websites like AirBNB would require JavaScript. It&#x27;s a bloody classifieds website. Out of the top 10 most visited websites I use, I can see only 3-4 of them really needing a fancy JS frontend.

Things like certificate pinning might be able to mitigate that. Even though it&#x27;s been a bit of a farce (in no small part due to the quizzically large set of trusted root CAs) the idea is that the CAs that you trust do their due diligence and don&#x27;t sign fraudulent requests.<p>>[0] If you really care, you should use a CA-signed cert. But every attack that possible when using self-signed certs is not only possible when using plain HTTP, but much easier to execute, and also much easier to execute silently.<p>Right, but the <i>owner</i> of the server you&#x27;re connecting to is the one that has to choose if the data they&#x27;re serving or receiving qualifies for protection of this sort. By omission they&#x27;ve basically taken the position that their pages or data are not worth preventing an attacker from MitM&#x27;ing you. If you allow self-signed certificates to fly without a warning at that point you&#x27;re taking the decision to secure from a MitM attack away from the server owner that wants to protect their pages. Sure, a savvy user would notice a change, but what if they&#x27;ve never been to that site before?<p>Here&#x27;s a scenario: Bob&#x27;s Widgets sells Widget 9000 and has a secure site with a certificate signed by a CA. Alice hops on free WiFi at a Widget convention and visits for the first time, hoping to buy some of these amazing widgets Bob sells. Except Mallory intercepted the traffic and swapped out a self signed certificate. Bob&#x27;s only way of telling Alice that his certificate and therefore traffic is authentic is by using one signed by a trusted third party.<p>Now that isn&#x27;t to say that I don&#x27;t think your idea has merit. It just doesn&#x27;t fit into how we currently do things. What might work is a keeping port 80 and port 443. Port 80 is secured by a self-signed certificate but the user isn&#x27;t informed (via their browser&#x27;s indicators, like a green icon or what-have-you) that their connection is secure because it isn&#x27;t in the sense that it will protect them from MitM attacks. It is however encrypted and you can have the browsers trigger warnings when the key changes similar to the way SSH does. 443 still behaves exactly the same where users only trust CA signed certs by default.",1427588599

In my neck of the woods, kids get to ride free up to a certain age (like 4 or 5). After that they pay adult fares.<p>If you&#x27;re going the maximum fare distance at rush hour, it&#x27;s something like $5.90 one way here per adult, but parking is like $15-$20. At that point you may be better of driving if you don&#x27;t value your time (traffic is abysmal).<p>My own commute is $2.20 one way at rush hour. Even with five adults (two parents and three kids over four years of age) the $22 you&#x27;d spend roundtrip on transit fares is comparable to the cost of driving and parking, but with less hassle.<p>In cities like New York with cheaper fares and reasonable monthly passes you can drastically cut down on your transit costs and also have to deal with massively more expensive parking (if any) and tolls.<p>Of course, one of the advantages of urban areas like mine with regards to travel cost is that many trips can be done without any wheels whatsoever, be they steel or rubber. The grocery store is across the street, next to the pharmacy, there&#x27;re a few doctors offices, many restaurants, convenience stores, schools, parks, restaurants, tourist attractions, etc. all within a few minutes on foot.<p>All of those trips are essentially free (minus the wear and tear on your shoes and clothes), promote good health, have a reduced environmental impact, reduce traffic, and require less tax resources than other forms of travel.<p>Bringing the whole family on transit would be a less common occurrence. For certain trips, ZipCar or Car2Go may also be an option. Also, for trips outside of walkable or transit accessible areas, rental cars are available. I myself have a rental car agency across the street, so if I wanted to go hiking and didn&#x27;t own a car I could.",1427587861

So I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s vague.<p>When the person taking the action is recording the action, and the information is kept private, then it&#x27;s what I consider to be high quality information, even at very low levels of detail. Contrast this with the quality of information that ad networks get (it&#x27;s lesser). Given that low-quality information the usual situation, I completely understand why you think that it takes a large amount of computing power to make useful predictions from it. I&#x27;ve found that the situation is greatly simplified when dealing with high quality information.",1427587274

It could also be bounded by natural resources.<p>For example even if the number of mouths to feed increases, the number of farmers cannot increase beyond what there is farmland for. So the hands will be competing for who gets to plough the fields, in exchange for a meal. Too many hands along with too little land, and the losers starve.",1427587217

I guess that most of that 50% running in HPC is FORTRAN77 written many, many years ago, with a bit of Fortran90/95 and only an insignificant fraction of Fortran 20xx.",1427587210

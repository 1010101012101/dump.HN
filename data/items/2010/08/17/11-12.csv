(the goldmine aspect)<p>I think money is an especially a bad motivation for starting your own product.<p>So if its about being creative, doing lots of different projects, having an influence on what your working on and where the product is going: you can do this working for the right company as well.<p>Of course the level of control is higher when you're running your own company, but so are the risks.<p>Isn't the important question: is the process important, i.e programming & working on interesting ideas, or is it the end result that counts, i.e having a successful product that is generating an income for you and where you have total control over?",1282046286

Who subsequently used Xenix to grow their start-up, the Santa Cruz Operation, into a $200M/year multinational.<p>(This was before the dark days in the late 90s when, having been spanked out of the desktop market, the board of SCO sold their IP <i>and the company name</i> to a linux startup from Utah called Caldera, who renamed themselves the SCO Group and went into the IP troll business.

1610794,comment,1610540,1610540,0,0,ilamont,,,"Former technology editor (IDG) here. The problem most reporters and bloggers face is a lack of time to research and write. There are too many potential stories, and not enough bandwidth to cover it all. This problem has been exacerbated by industry layoffs and Internet-related factors that make it much easier for startups to contact news organizations directly, as opposed to going through PR people. The result: A flood of emailed pitches and inquiries (many of them off-topic) that can't be properly followed-up.<p>There is also tremendous pressure to write articles that will get lots of page views. This makes it more difficult to justify writing straight-up product stories or reviews, unless it's something that's truly innovative or game-changing for the public. It's much easier to simply write about some minor Apple rumor, Microsoft's latest screw-up, or Facebook's umpteenth design tweak, add an irresistible headline, and perform a little ""SMO"" (social media optimization -- submitting to Digg, Twitter, etc.). Look at Techmeme on any given day to see how prevalent this type of writing is.<p>Nevetheless, I think if you personalize the pitch and identify likely writers (like TFA says) it will help differentiate it from the pack of press releases that form the bulk of many writers' email inboxes. Also, follow up nicely a few days later, asking if the writer has had time to review the earlier email or clarifying whether or not they are the right person to cover this type of product. Some will still ignore you, but others will respond, even if it's only to say, ""sorry, not interested. Try _____.""<p>One other piece of advice if you're looking for publicity: If you get an offer to speak at a conference or participate at a panel, do it. These days, there's a good chance that <i>some</i> blogger will be in the audience and writing about the interesting things he/she heard, even if it's local event or meetup. If it's a big technology conference, and assuming news organizations have a travel budget to send people there, there will probably be journalists or pro bloggers (paid) writing about the sessions. Conferences are great for them, because they (usually) get to hear interesting tidbits about interesting products or trends that are not moderated by a press release or PR drone, and they can crank out many stories/posts in a single day without having to deal with scheduling/interview overhead. I have really positive memories of conferences such as Webby Connect and MIT's EmTech, as well as a YCombinator open house when they were still in Cambridge. At all of these events, there was lots of great stuff to write about, including from companies/people that I didn't know much about before I went in.<p>EDIT: Added background and ""off-topic"" to first graf. It's one of the biggest irritants to technology reporters to get a pitch that has absolutely nothing to do with what they or their publication covers.<p>EDIT 2: Added last graf about events",1282043896

It's as PaulHammond said: Embedding fonts means downloading a copy of the whole font.<p>TypeKit tracks how big the font files are. Each font might only be ~20-30K - but that's one weight/style. If you use multiple weights and styles, that's 20-30K per each. It's easy to rack up 3-4 weights, and of course I want italics on some of those == 4 weights times 2 italics times 3 fonts = 20-30k times 24 and now we're talking half a meg or so...<p>If I'm demoing 18 fonts on a page, even at a single weight and style - that's approaching half a meg right there.<p>I think using an image is the right call.<p>But if you want to see TypeKit in action (I get no benefit from pushing them - I'm just a satisfied user), here's a couple of sites I'm using it on:<p><a href=""http://picklepatchpcb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picklepatchpcb.com/</a><p><a href=""http://daychilde.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daychilde.com/</a><p><a href=""http://music.isaac.im/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://music.isaac.im/</a><p><a href=""http://oilspillupdate.us/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oilspillupdate.us/</a><p><a href=""http://panamacitypc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://panamacitypc.com/</a><p><a href=""http://rockincompany.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rockincompany.com/</a>",1282043240

Their nostrils flair and their voice rises. A litany of denials, excuses and accusations pour forth.  And you know immediately that their project is going to be an incoherent piece of crap.  This is a good coaching moment. :-)""<p>Ah, memories.  However, I don't think that's limited to newbies...  It also applies to anyone who is egotistical and controlling.  They think any idea they have is an idea that everyone will love, and can't accept it when you tell them otherwise.  This obviously makes them bad designers.",1282043136

So the idea that those people who have smaller payoffs don't still have a burning avaricious desire is consistent with his suggestion.<p>The question is, /if/ his hypothesis is true and there is a correlation, what is the causation? Does winning big give you a taste for it and make you want to try again? Or is it (more likely in me eyes) that only those with such a strong drive to beat out the odds will ever make it to the really big payouts without cashing in early for less.",1282042929

8766279,comment,8764135,8765883,0,0,zaroth,,,"IRS requires paying taxes as restricted stock vests (or up front if you so-elect) based on the fair market value of the stock. Or, if options, based on the intrinsic + time-value of the option. So maintaining a low common stock valuation becomes a crucial exercise if you want to actually be able to issue any meaningful number of shares to your employees.<p>You can value investor preferred shares at a significant markup to your common stock by giving a non-participating liquidation preference. So you can raise $50m at $800m and not completely wreck the next round of options. It&#x27;s called the &quot;Thin Common&quot; strategy. The idea is I sold X shares for $50mm, but since they also got a $50mm preference as part of the deal, the common share value is still no-where near $50mm / X.<p>What Spiegel is saying, which is spot-on, is that having revenue will encourage a Section 409a valuation based on discounted cash-flow for common stock which will be minuscule compared to the investor value on preferred shares. 409a is about gaining a safe-harbor where your valuation is presumed reasonable and harder for the IRS to contest.<p>This allows them to keep moving shares into employees hands at a reasonable rate, or if options, then issuing them without an impossibly high strike price. The problem Mitch is pointing out is the Facebook offer also plays into the 409a to some extent. If someone offers you $3 billion cash, it&#x27;s hard to claim you are worth less than $3 billion.<p>If you are issuing restricted stock, or RSUs, you have to price them at fair market value, and either the employee PAYS you that money, or the value of the shares is taxable income as they vest.<p>If your valuation is too high, any modest stock grant (remember they are only 30 employees) requires someone to pay ~40% of that amount in cash as taxes. So it becomes quickly impossible to give a meaningful number of shares -- the tax consequence is just too immense.<p>For example, lets say they issue 1% of their shares to their 30 employees next year. They have a 409a valuation based on $0 revenue, 13 months of runway, and a plan to hopefully possibly achieve $20mm of revenue in the next 12 months. Their accountant says that equals $200mm common stock value, so they owe taxes on $2mm of income. Not so bad. But if the IRS comes back and says, wait just a minute, those shares were worth $3 billion at the time, you owe us $15mm in taxes and another $30mm in penalties....<p>Anyone who STARTED at Snapchat early on would have received shares at PAR value, and if they were restricted, would have done an 83(b) election to pay tax up-front at the current value, instead of paying tax at the market value as they vested over time.<p>If anyone at Snapchat has significant vesting shares and did NOT do the 83(b) election to pay tax at an early-days valuation, they are now totally fucked, because every month they vest more shares, they owe millions of dollars to the IRS and they have no liquidity with which to pay the tax man.<p>The system is stupidly broken. The way I would do it is that freshly minted common stock should transfer tax-free until a subsequent transfer or sale (not including transfers through probate). Then the full value should be taxed at short or long-term capital gain. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason to tax, or even attempt to value, the initial issuance of unregistered and non-transferable securities of a private company. Simply wait till they are first sold, or otherwise encumbered, and collect taxes from the market value at that time. Registered stock could remain under the current rules.<p>In a sense, even declining an offer from Facebook cuts off new hires from obtaining reasonably priced shares, thwarting Snapchat&#x27;s ability to hire and retain the best talent. It&#x27;s an interesting &quot;damned if you don&#x27;t&quot; scenario.",1418884966

8766275,comment,8761076,8761623,0,0,ajmurmann,,,"This is a very American view. When I grew up in Germany EVERYONE had a scale for cooking because every recipe gives all larger quantities in grams. I think the only exception is the difference is the equivalent of &quot;a pinch&quot;. When I moved to the US I didn&#x27;t have a scale and most recipes I cooked were American and I ended up using cups etc. I got totally used ot it after a while and everything was fine. However, I love cooing and wanted to get more into modernist cuisine. That pretty much requires a scale. Having used a scale for cooking again I cannot overstate how incredibly convenient it is. It saves a lot of time and cleaning of measuring devices. You just put your container (pot, bowl or whatever you will use later for processing) onto the scale; zero the scale; and start puring in the first ingredients till you go tthe right amount. Then you just zero the scale again and do the next ingredients. No need to rinse measuring cups in between. The metric system also has the added benefit that 1 liter translates for water based liquids to 1kg which means you again just pour the liquid into your bowl that&#x27;s on the scale. The scale has pretty much only upsides. The downside that most people in the US don&#x27;t have a scale is only a downside because culturally US Americans don&#x27;t use scales for cooking. On the flip side you can say that measuring cups are incovenient because Europeans don&#x27;t have them.",1418884902

Yes! That&#x27;s right! (More or less.) Except that Uber:<p>1. Requires us to take their word for it.<p>2. Doesn&#x27;t express this through their user interface in any way, shape, or form.<p>3. Has a significant burden of proof after all of the PR debacles they&#x27;ve been through ranging from Hurricane Sandy, to Emil Michael, etc. etc., all the way up to the Sydney hostage crisis (cf. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2014/12/uber-surge-sydney/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2014/12/uber-surge-sydney/</a>).<p>Issues 1-3 presented above represent a <i>user experience</i> deficiency.<p><pre><code>    Surge-haters have an iTunes-like mental model

That&#x27;s Uber&#x27;s problem, not their customers&#x27; problem. If a $25 billion corporation cannot figure out how to properly explain this to their customers, then it begs the question of who they&#x27;re hiring with all that cash.<p>The Wired article I linked to above says this, which I completely agree with:<p><pre><code>    The fact is, even though Uber didn’t

There&#x27;s various ways it can be supported which make it much cheaper than naive methods.<p>For example, ARM has a sticky overflow flag &quot;Q&quot;. The idea is that you don&#x27;t have to explicitly check the flag after every flag-setting instruction - instead you execute a bundle, and check if any set the &quot;Q&quot; flag at a point where you must branch or otherwise accept the output. Sadly, this is only implemented for a limited number of instructions (e.g QADD QSUB), and pretty much obsolete. Still - the idea is sound in that it doesn&#x27;t cost a stall, if properly scheduled, and greatly reduces the number of branching points.<p>You can somewhat do the same purely in software with the compiler, but the lack of a &quot;sticky&quot; flag means it&#x27;ll need to access - and potentially stall - at each point where flags would be overwritten by another ALU instruction.<p>I hear Rust did go down this path for a while but abandoned it. Pretty much all (non-Rust) code I write these days would SERIOUSLY benefit from global overflow detection.

I love Redis, but I can&#x27;t seem to hold on to it when people at my company mention the word &quot;cluster&quot;.

8766177,comment,8765714,8766169,0,0,derefr,,,"Kind of makes sense, though. Since the C standard says that integer overflow is undefined, you can think of the &quot;C abstract machine&quot; as being built on an assumption of an underlying architecture that provides magic fixed-width-yet-arbitrary-precision integers (and/or an assumption of omniscient programmers who always know what their inputs will be and never let math happen if it would result in overflow.) Basically, you can&#x27;t talk about overflow in C, or even to a C compiler, because as soon as you make the fact that overflow is happening explicit, you&#x27;ve stepped outside the C abstract machine.<p>It&#x27;s like trying to talk to Haskell about explicit thunks, or Lisp about stack-vs-heap allocation. The language encapsulates the concept away from you, so if you wrench it back, you&#x27;re no longer quite writing the language; you&#x27;re writing a union of it and something else.",1418882407

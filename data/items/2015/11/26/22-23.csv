The media outlets and authors responsible for this will continue doing it - and probably got (and will get) high praise for the traffic numbers.<p>She gets some more attention for calling attention to this, and increases our collective cynicism a little more (and rightly so).<p>It&#x27;s tempting to call this a victimless crime, but it&#x27;s really not. The victims are those who are actually outraged, often by actually outrageous things, like US police taking people&#x27;s money, beating them up, and killing them. Or by regulatory capture in energy and banking. Or by US foreign policy hypocrisy. Or any number of other things.<p>Honestly, if there was some way for me to <i>fine</i> media outlets in general and specific authors in particular for this behavior, I would do it. It is <i>wrong</i> to shovel shit into people&#x27;s minds especially if you have an official &quot;press&quot; designation. You&#x27;ve violated trust, and if the media doesn&#x27;t police itself, then the media itself is going to be replaced with something that does.",1448578686

Your GI tract needs to break down the fiber in order to release the sugar, which takes time. The sugar is absorbed by your small intestine more slowly, causing a gentler glycemic response. This is analogous to &#x27;extended release&#x27; medication, where the dose is delivered slowly over a longer period of time.<p>Separating the sugar from the fiber (as with juicing) means that all the sugar is bioavailable more or less immediately after you consume it, Causing the blood sugar high followed by the insulin spike.

So I tried to track down the original.

Did you know, for example, that it takes 6-8 medium sized apples to make just 1 cup of apple juice? You probably wouldn’t be able to eat 6-8 medium apples in a single sitting. (I know I can barely eat one!) But you can casually throw back a cup of apple juice, and you would probably be willing to return for seconds. That’s why fruit juice is dangerous. It’s far too easy to consume far too much sugar.&quot;<p>This paragraph is, arguably, far more important than all the hysteria about flavor packs, but it&#x27;s only partially correct.  Fibre does help provide satiety but, in and of itself, it isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s good for you about eating whole fruit unless you simply aren&#x27;t getting enough fibre and have issues with constipation.  What fibre <i>does</i> do is reduce the rate at which we absorb sugar. Apple juice will give you a nice fast sugar high and then a low, much like candy.  An apple will give you a gradual surge of energy for a while.  If you&#x27;re going to eat something sweet, it&#x27;s far better for you if it comes combined with fibre.<p>So don&#x27;t go searching for juice that doesn&#x27;t use flavor packs.  Don&#x27;t buy a juicer and juice your own either, because you&#x27;re still throwing away what separates fruit from candy.  Don&#x27;t mess around with fermenting juices and all that probiotic jazz.

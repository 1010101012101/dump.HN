The quality was horrible.  At the end of the cancellation conversation, the guy asked, ""May we ask why you're canceling?"" And I replied, ""You know how you and I have had to keep repeating ourselves, and saying, 'What?' every ten seconds?"" And he responded, ""Oh.""<p>Anyway, I thought Vonage had gone bankrupt a few years back, or something.  I don't understand why anyone would use it for anything.  Cell phones are pervasive, dirt cheap, and they work reliably.  Skype is mostly free, has video and other cool features, and works reliably.  Vonage has none of these things going for it.",1250733515

Your example does not work because it presumes that bonuses are, or should be, tied to profitability or performance of the entire company.<p>Many companies wisely do not do this; rather they tie bonuses to the performance of business processes they are responsible for.<p>Suppose you work at a plumbing and carpentry business. You work for the plumbing division; an incompetent coworker works in the carpentry division. The coworker buys loads of wood for a client, but then lets it sit in the rain for too long and it rots. You have an employment contract that rewards you with a bonus for the performance in the plumbing business, which performs well. However, the loss of material causes the firm's overall profitability to turn to a loss, even though your division has reversed some of the damage of the carpentry division.<p>Should your bonus be reneged because of the carpenter?<p>Suppose you have a job offer at a competing plumbing business, and you decide that you will leave for that job if your current employer eliminates your bonus despite the contribution in profits you have made to the firm. Is the firm best served by eliminating your bonus?<p>Questions of bonuses for the CEO, presuming it was the CEO who presided over the disaster, are another matter: it's not clear why they should be rewarded by the board, given that they are ultimately responsible for all divisions.",1250733393

774248,comment,773551,774244,0,0,gnosis,,,"I would agree that most chess players probably feel good when they win and bad when they lose.<p>However, there's a big difference between that and agreeing with Fischer's goal of ""crushing the other guy's ego"" or your earlier assertion that chess is about ""beating someone up with your mind"".  I don't think that's true at all, or at least no more true of chess than any other game.<p>Also, I would strongly disagree with Fischer being ""the archetypical chessplayer"".  From what I've read about chess players through the ages and from my personal experience, the overwhelming majority of chess players are nothing like Fischer.<p>Sure, you will occasionally find an obnoxious, childish, mentally ill genius, but that's the exception.  Even non-genius chess players are generally no more childish or obnoxious than people in the general population.<p>And I see no evidence that the average chess player's motivation is anything like Fischer's motivation, except wanting to win and hating to lose.

Just because he was an insane genius does not mean that all the things he said were wrong.<p>Because he was so good, he could say things about the game that were controversial, but deep down a lot of patzers knew that what he was saying was right.<p>Sure, one's source of enjoyment from chess varies between players, but what both Scott McCloud and Fischer were pointing out is that winning a game of chess makes you feel wonderful, and losing one makes you feel bad.<p>I think virtually every chess player would be familiar with those feelings, and would concede that ""crushing the other guy's ego"" (or its corollary ""not having my ego crushed"") has a little bit to do with it.<p>Whether you are playing Spassky for the World Championship or a game of blitz with a friend, the emotions are the same.",1250732638

774239,comment,773943,773943,0,0,gwern,,,"> HighlightCam, which we covered last month, is a service that can look through hours of video footage and identify when something happens. The company’s first product involves security cameras — it can take many hours of security footage and then identify the few moments when things out of the ordinary are happening, cutting down the footage to only a few minutes of important content. Soon the company will be releasing its API, which will allow developers to tap into the software to shorten a variety of different kinds of content (including things like wedding videos). The software can produce 20-30 second trailers automatically for any kind of video.<p>This is actually an interesting one, I think: one of the knocks against [lifelogging](<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifelog</a>) is that it will be too hard to search all the hours of video, but condensed videos would be much easier to search.",1250732206

Given that scenario, ""possible doom"" is the conservative risk-averse choice.<p>I think public school and other bureaucratic institutions help shape people in the direction of expecting bureaucracy as the ""norm""....I mean, it seems to me it's a culture and a mindset and a lifestyle and if you grow up with it, it's more comfortable than being out on a limb by yourself.  My sons were homeschooled for a long time and they are a lot less intimidated than I am about plans to become entrepreneurs.  I have long been torn between wanting to strike out on my own and wanting more conventional success.  I'm wired (and probably also trained) to want the perceived societal approval that goes along with making it in a large bureaucracy (big company, federal government...etc)  But I just don't fit in.<p>I currently have a corporate job and that has given me some degree of satisfaction that ""Yes! I <i>can</i> make it on those terms!""  But I've also been languishing in an entry-level job which doesn't begin to compare to the kind of recognition/success I've had in other (non-monetary) endeavors.  I've been very torn between wanting to pursue a career at the company and wanting to strike out on my own.  But recent events at work have convinced me that striking out on my own is the more risk-averse path.  I can't control what the folks in charge at the company are doing and recent developments concern me.  I've also seen that working a regular day job doesn't buffer me from the vagaries of the market as much as I thought it would.  It just gives me less control over how to meet the latest challenges than I would have if I ran the show.<p>So I believe I will end up out there on my own.

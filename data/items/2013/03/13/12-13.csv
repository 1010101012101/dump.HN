Until payment I can generally get a response from the seller but after that it's like I don't exist. Then there are the outright scams.<p>And please note, I'm a _buyer_. I shudder to think that I should ever be a seller on eBay; sellers are left empty handed if a buyer claims ""not as described."" Example: <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57352136-501465/paypal-makes-ebay-customer-destroy-$2500-violin-seller-left-empty-handed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57352136-501465/paypa...</a><p>When I try to shop for something online, even adding ""-eBay"" to a google search to drop eBay listings can be risky (it will eliminate any page that mentions eBay).<p>I believe this is relevant because the study is basically claiming eBay is well known enough that they don't need to advertise on Google. I'd argue exactly the opposite is happening: eBay is hemorrhaging users and a successful marketing campaign could change that. eBay needs Google more than Google needs eBay.<p>Amazon (mentioned in the article) and Apple are definitely innovative in the retail space. I notice they focus on targeted ads more than eBay does, because eBay's model is more hands off. And I think a direct consequence is Amazon and Apple can make good use of Google ads.<p>There's nothing wrong with ""hands off"" automation of big parts of your business. It works for Google.<p>But I can't really take eBay's study very seriously: if there are lots of customers and businesses who have grown tired of eBay (and PayPal), their advertising has got to be hurting.<p>Straighten out your house, eBay, and then people will want to stop by.",1363179552

They do not show up on a display, nor trigger an acoustical signal when received. The mobile provider, often at the behest of the police, will capture data such as subscriber identification IMSI.

5368006,comment,5365096,5365836,1,0,smosher,,,"Go is... fundamentally different than most runtimes? Probably. Better? Maybe. Better than the comparable ones? I think it's losing that war. You don't even need a special runtime, it can help, but I think the amount it helps is overstated in Go's case.<p>Concurrency isn't that hard in practice. If you're willing to forgo automatic multiplexing Perl will give you Go's concurrency model <i>in a library</i> written <i>ten years ago</i>, and it works as naturally as it does in Go. Python seems to have similarly good support but it probably doesn't look much like Go. I'm not sure what Lua's doing these days, but in the past I've found concurrency dead simple. If you happen to be writing C, time-slicing the work isn't even that hard. If you know enough about Go's concurrency to tell whether a single goroutine will cause its scheduler to deadlock all by itself, you can easily write concurrent programs in all these languages.<p>I know this will be a controversial claim, but all of these solutions are easier to reason about than Go. Usually not by much, and it has primarily to do with the nature of its multi-threading support, but that's just the concurrency model being weakened by the support for convenient parallelism.<p>There is a case where Go is  best: when you like writing Go more than the others. You can guarantee a little less about concurrency than most, but at least you can usually guarantee more about types than most. If you like writing Go you will either luckily avoid the problems or develop habits that prevent you from producing concurrency bugs, possibly even without realizing it.",1363178876

The majority of my response was to show how the terms ""old"" and ""new"" were not useful qualifiers.<p>Michael Pollan's ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" is just as useful a guide, without making a needless distinction about old/new, genetics, processed/unprocessed, etc. I have no disagreements with his statement. I see nothing which you've written which gives better food advice than that statement. For example, when I wrote ""but it doesn't make good sense"", I meant ""the use of the terms 'old' and 'new'"" don't make good sense. That I disagree with your reasoning does not mean I disagree with your conclusion that plants should be preferred over pizza rolls.<p>You've changed the goalposts. You said ""Drinking [alcohol] on a regular basis is about as stupid as eating arsenic or lead salts for kicks."" I pointed out that humans have been drinking alcohol on a regular basis for 1,000s of years. Now you say ""as much as heavy metals as possible."" But I never said that people always drank as much alcohol as possible, only that it was part of their daily life. And still is in many cultures.<p>You suggest that my argument is that since paleo can't give a ""detailed numerical analysis of which heavy metal is more or less toxic"" then therefore we should consume heavy metals. This is of course a wrong interpretation of my view. I observe that we have cultures now and historically which drink alcohol on a daily basis. If there were a large toxic effect of ""ethanol in your blood"" - as there is, for example, with lead acetate - then it would be easily observed. Since it isn't observed, its dangerous effects must be far smaller than that of heavy metals.<p>You may have the opinion that they are of similar hazard, but that opinion is contrary to the pretty strong evidence that does exist. This makes your statement a moral statement, though I think you also want it classified as a scientific statement.<p>If the paleo logic concludes that daily alcohol consumption is about as toxic as lead salts, and observation shows that daily alcohol consumption is nowhere near as toxic as lead salts, then the logic behind paleo must be incorrect as a scientific theory, no? Of course, moral, cultural, and religious reasons also give valid reasons to avoid certain foods, but those don't purport to be justified by scientific reasoning.<p>You've also changed your previous statement from ""Most of [your] meals"" having a hunk of meat to just dinner, and not even every dinner. And not even a ""hunk"", but as part of soup, so with these changes your professed meat diet has been reduced nearly 10-fold.

Basically, if this guy wanted such rigid requirements, he should have stuck with a high-end custom publishing house. O'Reilly has never tried to make its name synonymous with a quality publishing house; they are known because they gave a voice to smart people in the tech world. Since then, it has expanded, mostly because techs no longer buy books in print as much as they did, and because to be profitable in a down market, you have to cut corners. The problem that plagued this author is that he associated the O'Reilly name with ""high design quality"" and that just isn't true. O'Reilly should be used when you want a recognizable publisher for tech books and to be included in their collection. If you are smart, you will also use the standard cover with an animal on it, such as a chinchilla.",1363176723

5808957,comment,5808627,5808627,30,0,JangoSteve,,,"I'll give my experience in case it helps, but I'd start out by giving some advice. If the reason you want to move from a permanent salaried position to contract work is to make more money, don't.<p>If you don't want to read my advice and just want my experience skip to the next section.<p>There's a reason contractors make more money; it's because it's a <i>lot</i> more work. The way I think of salaried employment is that it's an exchange. The salaried employee agrees to work for less than the market rate, and in exchange the employer agrees to subsidize your down time. In other words, you don't have to worry about constantly finding the next thing to do just to get paid. You get to focus on the work.<p>You'd be amazed how much work is involved contracting. You must go to networking events and startup meetups constantly for years in order to build up your identity. You must actually create your own portfolio website and keep it updated. You must keep your LinkedIn and Twitter profiles updated. You must do your taxes and send out W9s to each of your clients every year and follow up with them if they don't respond (and then talk with them more when they send you forms that don't match your records). You must meet with a lot of  people and talk about their projects before figuring out that only 50% of them are even relevant to what you do, and of those maybe 50% actually get to the quote/estimate stage, and of those maybe 50% become paying contracts.<p>I'd say, when I was just contracting to support myself, maybe 50% of my time was billable; closer to 75% when I actually had a big contract that could keep me busy for a few months without worrying about lining something else up right away. So, if my billable rate was $100/hr, my effective rate was closer to $50-$75/hr. And then here in the US, taxes would take about 30%, so closer to $35-$45/hr.<p>On top of all that, you can never count on the work you have. You may have a need for X hours per week to sustain yourself, but that doesn't mean your clients will require X hours. They only need what they need. And being a contractor, what you need is officially not their problem. Of course, you could always work out deals with clients that guarantee X hours per week, but they'll only agree to it if they think they actually need more than that, and as soon as they stop needing it, they'll end the contract.<p>You could be living the high life with one awesome client, your bread and butter, for months or even years, and then suddenly wake up to an email saying they no longer need your services. Maybe the project they had you do is finished. Or they decided they were spending enough with you to justify a full-time employee to do it in-house. Or maybe the CEO of the company just found out his nephew does programming, and he can do it instead of you. Maybe their decision to cut you is a good decision for them. Or maybe it's a really bad decision that you can't prevent them from making. Doesn't matter. All that matters is that, as of this morning, you now have no paying work.<p>I could go on and on, as these are only the most pertinent warnings that come to mind. Hopefully I've sufficiently scared you. Cool. Now here's how I did it...<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>First of all, I started contracting way before I needed to, just because it was fun, and it served as a way for me to get paid to learn how to do what I enjoyed and to become better. For years, I'd get up at 5 or 6am, go to work, come home around 5 or 6pm, make dinner, and work on my own projects until 2 or 3am. Having built your own projects is by far the best way to convince the first few clients to actually pay you (once you've done enough networking to meet them). I'd estimate I spent probably a couple thousand hours building my own projects, or building things in-kind for friends and family before getting someone to pay me straight up cash. I did this from the time I was a freshman in college to the time I was a senior (full-time student + job + side projects) before getting a paid contract I think, and then continued to do it for another year or so after college.<p>You may not have this problem if you're already salaried doing the same kind of work that you want to do contracting. I, however, was a mechanical and electrical engineer who wanted to build software. WIthout a relevant degree or official work experience, I had to teach myself and build stuff. After a few years building my own stuff, I also started doing a <i>lot</i> of open source work.<p>Eventually though, I had to start charging. This was hard. I started out, as anyone, low-balling some projects. Hopefully you only do that once or twice before you realize how unsustainable it is. Once I realized this, I started asking for more. I remember how guilty I felt at first, as I couldn't imagine that some site I could build would be work over $1,000 (!!!). It's actually funny to look back on it now, and realize how unsustainable even that was. I'm glad I listened to the advice or others at the time and didn't insist on such rates for long.<p>Like I said before, I continued to contract on the side, also spending tons of time grooming my own portfolio website, building side projects, working on open-source projects, and going to networking events (sometimes calling in my paid personal time to go to really good ones during the week), for several years.<p>I never considered quitting my job though until I knew I had enough work lined up to make the same amount I was currently making at my full-time engineering job. With student loans and whatnot, this wasn't really even an choice I could make. At times, it felt as though this would never happen. I couldn't conceive of a world where enough contract work existed that I could possibly line up. But I continued (I think this is where a love for what you do plays a strong role).<p>Eventually, through networking, I met someone who owned a web development company, and I discovered the world of sub-contracting. They had a lot of work and not enough people to do it. They wanted to hire me, but I knew I wanted to contract on my own. So we worked out a deal with me sub-contracting, and they could guarantee my at least 30 hours per week for the next 3 months. At our agreed upon rate, that was enough to beat what I was making as an engineer. I figured worst case was that I now had 3 months to find more work, and I put in my 2 week's notice. That was the scariest thing I had ever done (and in fact I wrote an article about it that became one of my first popular posts on HN at the time: <a href=""http://www.alfajango.com/blog/if-youre-nervous-about-quitting-your-boring-job-youre-sane/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alfajango.com/blog/if-youre-nervous-about-quittin...</a>).<p>Once I was contracting full-time and setting my own schedule, I was able to kick my networking into high gear. Meanwhile, my new friend's company kept me on as a subcontractor beyond those few months. They actually ended up getting a big client that insisted after a couple months that I was the only one who could lead development of their project. Due to networking and word of mouth, I ended up getting a few clients of my own, one of which was big enough to sub-contract several developers myself. Thankfully by that time, I actually knew some developers who'd do it, developers whom I had met networking and working on open-source).<p>And the ball has been rolling ever since. I now own a company that builds startups full-time. We are a sort of CTO + dev team for hire; or a software-consultancy-meets-VC if you want to think about it that way.<p>It's much more awesome than my engineering job. So, I'm not saying don't set off on your own. Just that it's a lot of work, and that none of it is guaranteed to ever pay off. Right now, I'd say my team and I live comfortably, but it's still a lot of stress day-to-day. If I had taken all that time and effort that I spent to be able to contract on my own, and instead channeled it into getting a better job, I'd probably have a lot more money than I do now. But it wouldn't be what I wanted to be doing. That's the real reason to start contracting, for personal growth.<p>In other words, it takes a lot of work to build a lifestyle as a contractor. If you took all that effort and time, side projects and personal branding, and channeled it instead as leverage to find a better job, that'd probably be a much quicker path to making more money than contracting. So, I wouldn't contract for the money, I'd do it because it's what you feel like you must do to be happy.<p><i>EDIT: I should also note that, reading through some of the other comments that say ""it's as simple as getting a client, going to meetups, etc."" I was tempted to say that at first too. I sometimes forget how much time I spent going to meetups and building experience before any of this really started becoming ""simple"" for me. It's easy to look back on the past 9 years I've been doing this and forget how much work went into each actual year, or how long a year really is.</i>",1370188786

Also remember that as well as the being your own boss stuff, you are going to be running a business, and that incurs overheads in both time and money for which no-one is going to pay you directly any more. This is part of the reason that contract work is charged at a higher rate than salaried employment: the fully loaded cost of employing someone in the UK is maybe double their salary and as the contractor you're now going to be taking on a lot of that burden directly. There is a lot more flexibility in how you price your services as a contractor, but whatever you do, don't make the mistake of trying to translate salary directly into some sort of hourly/daily/weekly rate.<p>Also, if you're going to do contract work in the UK, you should definitely learn a bit about tax and employment law and in particular IR35. The latter is a tax rule designed specifically to demonstrate how apparently reasonable ideas to fix apparently significant problems can in practice become bureaucratic nightmares that impose a significant burden on an entire industry and occasionally randomly destroy the careers of people who as far as they knew had done nothing wrong. There is a lot of fear-mongering about IR35, particularly from organisations that make money ""protecting"" you against it, but there is at least some risk here and you should understand it so you can make informed choices about it.",1370188683

I have Geiser installed, though now it's been a little while since I last used it (honeymoon got in the way!).<p>DrRacket indents things rather intelligently. If you newline after the first-position element, it will indent things just past the paren before the first-position element, so that everything lines up in a list. If you newline after any of the other elements first, it will line them up ahead of the function name. But really, most importantly, it seems to understand constructs like ""(let ([x 3])\n (displayln x))"" should line up the displayln call under the let keyword, not under the value expressions.<p>Emacs, on the other hand, understands varying levels of scope by matching parens, but just indents things a set number of spaces. I fully admit that this could just be my own ignorance of how to work Emacs.

No thanks, as much a traditionalist that I can be wrt yoga, some things are better the modern/western way.<p>Why do you assume that? I learnt yoga for free without doing any of that. If you can't find a reasonable person to teach you, all the source material is available for free. There are some benefits to doing those kind of activities. People nowadays are too egotistic. Those things are a nice way of curbing that.<p>Yoga was developed for spiritual reasons. That can't be denied. There have been people trying to remove its spiritual dimension through the ages. That can't be denied too. You can always use a church for just shelter. That does not make false that it was built for another purpose.<p>You have a finite life span. Do you want to use yoga to get a better body to increase your chances of finding a mate (or something equally trivial) or do you want to transcend finiteness? I thought all this was drivel too, till I got terribly fat and sick and was forced to do yoga.<p>The caution about being dogmatic applies to you too. Approach yoga with an open mindset while not thinking that the founders were complete morons when it came to spirituality. An analogy: just a few decades back almost everyone in the mainstream thought yoga had nil benefits. Nobody is stopping you from doing yoga on your atheistic mat.

So yes, recognized nuclear states are using very pure Pu239, but this is done for engineering convenience and not an absolute necessity. And the calculation probably changes for a state with a clandestine nuclear program, since it is much easier to hide the additional computing capacity to make a working reactor grade plutonium design, than it is to hide a breeder reactor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html</a>

The government is looking for (and creating when necessary) any excuse to attack Syria against its peoples will.<p>On top of all that, the government control over its peoples personal lives has become unbearable as of late.

It's the fusion of authoritarian quasi-fascist rule with capitalism-- a kind of socially conservative, often (but not always) religious conservative, but economically neo-liberal state of affairs. On the surface it sometimes looks theocratic, but in reality it's more of a dictatorship of gentrification. Religious morality (or sometimes secularized versions thereof) is used as a facade to condemn any form of social deviancy and especially to mentally control the lower classes by manipulating their religious faiths.<p>(We see the latter in America with the ""culture war,"" which is a way of distracting the largely-religious working classes while their future is sold out from under them.)<p>In conversations with fellow techies, it's disturbed me to what extent many seem to tacitly support this kind of thing. I've been in many conversations explicitly praising Singapore -- a country that permits death sentences for minor infractions -- as a viable model of the future.<p>The thing that makes Singaporification scary is that it works. The scariest dystopias are not hideous hellscapes where nobody would want to live, as those tend to self-destruct or at best persist in tiny enclaves and never catch on. Who would want to emulate North Korea? But seductive dystopias are dangerous because they <i>can</i> catch on. Who wouldn't want low crime, clean streets, and a wonderfully healthy economy? In that sense I find Singapore to be the scariest dystopia in the world today.<p>Historical precursors include Franco's Spain. Think of Singaporification as a gentler, less overtly violent form of Spanish fascism. But as we see if you openly challenge it, the gloves rapidly come off and your shiny clean utopia busts out the tanks, tear gas, and death penalty sentences.<p>Edit: on second thought, it also represents a fusion of liberal nanny-statism, conservative social authoritarianism, and neo-liberal economics.

Since then I've been obsessive about building up my contacts book to make sure I can get proactively in front of them as and when I want to, but renewals have come in enough that it's not been needed (though probably available from August - if you're looking for an MS stack guy with heavy SQL in the UK Midlands from then, mail me on greg.webb@alpinered.co.uk).<p>Honestly - the grass isn't as much greener as you might think. It's more hassle, less security and holidays suddenly become horrendously expensive. But if you fancy the lifestyle and think it's for you, give it a try. It doesn't have to be any harder than permanent employment to get into our stay in (if you use umbrella companies and are good enough), it does have its benefits and if it doesn't work out, go looking for permanent work again, enough people switch between them that you'll be fine.",1370186168

But since that was a one off (and I was sort of planning on moving country), I quit that job... then put some feelers out for possible contract work. And for the past five years I've been completely busy with that.<p>I'm a full-stack, jack-of-all-trades sort of dev. Bit rubbish at design (but I have a great designer I partner with when needed), but I do a bit of everything, from infrastructure, networking, database, middle tier and front-end html/css/javascript.
Any specialist in any of the above will wipe the floor with me skills/wise. But I'm pretty comfortable communicating with clients and helping get the best bang-for-buck with them only having to basically describe what they are trying to achieve.<p>My key bit of advice would be to fire difficult clients and only work for time and materials. If a client is too high a maintenance, you may not be a good fit for them, or them for you. In that case I try and transition them elsewhere, recommending someone that may be a better option.<p>Equally, fixed prices quotes are almost never worth it in my experience. I'd rather release early and often, then the client can then see how much business value they've gotten for XX amount of hours/money. After which, they can make the decision to either continue or to terminate, depending on whether they feel they're getting value or not. It's normally a completely different way of working for most clients, but I often offer a two week shared-risk starter deal to ease them into it. If it doesn't work, I'll absorb half the cost and we'll call it quits. But so far, every relationship seems to have worked out well.<p>The biggest downside is possibly taking time off. I'm pretty flexible about timings. I'll work when clients need it, and take breaks during slack periods (of which there haven't been enough). But my ex wasn't supportive of me having to work while on 'holiday'. It wasn't a lot (no more than 20 hours over a two week holiday), but YMMV depending on how understanding your partner is/isn't.<p>As far as transitioning goes. Try sounding people out for possible side projects you can do while keeping your day job. I worry that I'm not a good networker, and that one day the work will completely dry up. But on the flip-side, I kind of want that to happen, so I can focus more on projects that I want to do myself. And it's hard to do those when you've got paying projects to do. But if you can pick up a couple of side projects, once they're earning almost enough to live off, you've no excuse to pack in your day job and do that full time. I've got a couple of mates who started contracting this way.<p>Unless you mean just straight out contracting... as in, apply for a typical contract and work there.. just like a day job. In which case, it's a piece of piss... just start applying. But I find recruiters(pimps) rather distasteful to go through, so I've avoided them completely. (There are good ones, but they're few and far between)<p>Good luck!",1370186111

If you don't have a way to differentiate yourself how can you package what you offer to make it seem better than what they are offering, if you can't dazzle with brilliance baffle with bullshit.<p>1. What do your customers want? You know what they need, but what do they want? Designers often seem to design to impress other designers, programmers enjoy pulling neat hacks that other programmers admire, and system admins love building cool stuff that integrates some of the latest automation, but are these things what your customers want? If it is great! Just make sure to gut check yourself when you put together what services you offer to make sure you aren't just following your own fantasies of what you wish work was like. Now that you know what they want figure out how to sell them on the cool stuff you enjoy doing as well as long as it doesn't get in the way of the initial goals they have. Yes you may know better than them in regards to what they need in some respects but they know their business case better than you, if you can meet in the middle you will get plenty of referrals.<p>2. Advertise, advertise, advertise. I used a combination of spotify ads and google ad words initially. The number one thing to remember about adwords is, don't lock yourself into just the keywords you think should work. Find out what business people would type into google when searching and target those words.<p>3. This is something a lot of people might disagree with but, I over book myself, not to the extent that the work suffers but to the extend that my work home life blurs and it's mildly stressful. You never know when a client might flake out and having that cushion will save you when your clients nephew takes a course on youtube and thinks he is now a $your_job_here. I make my money over a 6 month time period and then take 6 months off. I have a much closer relationship to my children and my spouse and over all I'm much happier, the ability to travel is really nice as well.<p>Keep your main revenue stream until you can at least get a few paying clients then shove off but remember you will need to think about health insurance if you are in the U.S. (I infer from the title you are in London) if you do have to worry about insurance and are in the U.S. you can look into <a href=""http://www.freelancersunion.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freelancersunion.org/</a> consider it leverage when buying insurance. Also keep in mind there is significant overhead from book keeping I was shocked at the number of hours it took, I said screw it and automated the whole process.<p>Also keep in mind they can pay contract workers so well for a few reasons, it's results based, they don't have to pay for insurance or other benefits, there is no training budget involved.<p>Still it's the best decision you can make, you are your own master though and it feels amazing.<p>Good luck!",1370185288

Other than that, nothing special.<p>One thing that I didn't see being brought up in the thread you mentioned is the fact that a recruitment agency bills a rate different to what I get payed. For example, my agency is likely billing out at $80/hour or more, yet I only get $55/hour.<p>So I'm curious if others were entering amounts that agencies were billing out, rather than what they were being payed.",1370185272

It doesnt mean that Christianity is the state religion or something.<p>Turkey has been a successful majority Muslim but very secular and democratic state for a very long time. Maybe thats changing <p>(Ah, decisions, decisions. Sometimes I think the EU should have accelerated making a move on letting Turkey join. There are substantial risks associated with that, sure, but I also think that the EU would have had a significant chance of changing the trajectory Turkey is on.)",1370185250

It's useful if you have a specific specialization like SEO or marketing, because it's easy to take than and turn it into, ""how I can improve your company/bottom-line."" On the other hand, someone that is just a general developer with no particular specializations probably will have to spend more time coming up with a pitch for themselves.",1370185248

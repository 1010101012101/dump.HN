You have to extend your visa once every two months but you don't have to do a visa run until you hit month 18.<p>Once you get into doing things like renting a real office, hiring employees and doing local work, then you would want to go legit.

4396341,comment,4393756,4394596,1,0,mistercow,,,"> I had a brain hiccup with respect to the test/training sets (I used it correctly later on).<p>Just to be clear, it's not just that you said ""test data"" instead of ""training data"", but that you said that too much is a bad thing. More data is always a good thing for ML.<p>[Edit: Actually, there are times where it may not be. If you're doing something like image classification and your data is being created by hand qualitatively, you can actually get overfitting from adding data. As far as I understand, this is because the measurement based on fuzzy perceptual qualities is biased, so the algorithm will overfit to that bias. Maybe this applies with your analogy; I'm not sure.]<p>>""Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many parameters relative to the number of observations. ""<p>Well, that's in reference to overfitting as it applies to statistical models, not machine learning. To apply that reasoning to machine learning you have to look at the <i>output</i> of the machine learning algorithm rather than the parameters fed into the algorithm itself. That is, an overfit learned function will often be characterized by excessive complexity, but this is not a result of telling the learning ML algorithm to look at too many parameters. It's a result of telling the ML algorithm to train for too long given the size of its training set.<p>A key point to note is that an overfit function can be excessively complex even based on very few input parameters if it builds the learned function out of overly complex relationships between those parameters. Conversely, it can build a very simple function, even if many of the parameters prove to be irrelevant, by simply not making the learned function depend on those parameters at all.",1345211811

4396269,comment,4395713,4395713,2,0,loso,,,"This article lack of detail derails the point that it is trying to make. Yes, there are millions of people who try to enter certain creative fields at any one time but a very small percentage truly have what it takes to enter the business. And when I say have what it takes, only a small percentage of that is talent. Talent is important but it is only the first step.<p>The lucky part is impressing the right person at the right time that you can become a star. After that you still need to be set up with the right team, proper motivation and yes some talent. But the most important part of that equation is the right team, especially the marketing team. If you look at the music business, they usually try to sell you a rags to riches tale when it comes to their artists. They want you to believe that the person was found on the street, signed to a record deal, and now millions of people love them. Very rarely is that true. The music business has a formula and they try their best to stick with it.<p>You can see that happening right now with an artist named Azealia Banks. I use her as an example because she is in the middle of that process now. Not mainstream yet but on the cusp of it. Her label(Interscope) is pushing her as an independent artist that just happens to be getting some attention. They want you to believe that luck and her talent is why she is getting any attention at all. The truth is her marketing team is doing a tremendous job at getting her name out there. No luck at all. A well planned cosign by Kanye West, the use of Twitter to get into well publicized problems (beef) with other artist ala the 50 Cent strategy, Several big name magazine covers or articles before anyone knows who she is, a ""just so happens"" controversial Dazed and Confused magazine cover that is getting a lot of attention now, another cosign by fashion designer Alexander Wang, and all of this before she has even put an official album out.<p>None of that is luck or because of talent. When a label thinks it has a hot property then they step up the marketing gas. Gone are the days of putting gigantic posters up & magazine ads and catering to radio stations. Now the job of marketing is to fool the customer into thinking the artist popularity is all organic. The web is used to break the star, traditional forms of media is used to mass market them. So to the outsider it seems lucky but it really isn't. It is really the music business equivalent of SEO.",1345210949

I mean sure a lot of people are indignant about the fact that Twitter became what it was through the ingenuity of the developer community, and without them Twitter would never have grown to its current size, but that's neither here nor there.<p>The bottom line is that Twitter's communications make it clear that they are grasping at straws for their profitability and that no developer is safe if they think you are capturing too much value.  Obviously you always run a risk building on someone else's platform, but Twitter's direction and language around this would make any developer a <i>fool</i> to start anything new on that platform.",1345210946

Listing the processes or running top and seeing just how incredibly lightweight it is ... makes me happy. It feels so zippy. I realize this same thing can probably be accomplished with linux by installing a very baseline operating system, but it's refreshing to see nonetheless.<p>I'm looking forward to playing with FreeBSD this weekend ... any tips are welcome!",1345209051

4396126,comment,4393817,4395464,4,0,mistercow,,,"Sure. You need a scale, but high precision isn't terribly important if you mix up large batches at once. A postal scale probably won't cut it though; you want at least as good as 100mg precision. You can get these ingredients from online retailers (except the orange extract  get that at a grocery store). I've used Hard Rhino Muscle and Pure Bulk and been satisfied with both.<p>My caffeine/theanine formula:<p>Caffeine - 1.6g<p>L-theanine - 3.2g<p>Water - 2 cups<p>This makes for 100mg of caffeine per fluid ounce of solution, which makes measuring pretty easy. That is like a cup of coffee on the weak side of average, or 2-3 cups of tea. 200mg is like a strong cup of coffee. I have found that 100mg twice a day is close to the sweet spot where I get energy from it but don't build a tolerance. Obviously if you already have a tolerance, you'll want to use more. This mixture should be refrigerated to keep stuff from growing in it. Also, you can vary the concentration a little, but there is a limit at which the theanine solution will gel into an unusable colloidal mass. Hot water is useful for getting the ingredients to dissolve initially.<p>The theanine is there for two reasons: 1) it smooths out the jitters from caffeine, and has a mood elevating effect when used with caffeine and 2) studies indicate that combined with caffeine, it has a number of cognitive benefits. 2:1 theanine to caffeine is around the ratio that evidence supports.<p>My flavoring solution is:<p>Citric acid - 30g<p>Malic acid - 10g (optional)<p>Sucralose - 1.5g<p>Orange (or lemon) extract (83% alcohol) - 8g<p>Water - 2 cups<p>I put this in a squeeze bottle like the kind fast food places sometimes put vinegar and oil in, and it only takes a little squirt (about a teaspoon) to flavor a cup of water. I don't bother measuring this, as it's easy enough to do by taste. But do be careful not to make it too strong or the citric acid will hurt your mouth. Nothing dangerous, but it can make your gums sore.<p>Malic acid is not strictly necessary. It adds a bit of fruitiness, but it's subtle. You can leave it out and use 35g of citric instead of 30g.<p>Sucralose is the sweetener in Splenda, but it's important to remember that Splenda is highly diluted with fillers to make it the same sweetness as sugar. Pure sucralose is 600 times as sweet as sugar, so it must be measured with care. Hard Rhino is the only source I've found for it. Other sweeteners like xylitol, stevia extract, and erythritol are easier to find. Xylitol and erythritol are not sweeter than sugar, and I find stevia unpleasant. If you like stevia, it's actually more cost effective than sucralose; it's half as sweet, but it's cheaper.<p>If you don't want to bother with the flavoring solution, you can also mix the caffeine with anything that is sweet and sour because those flavors mask the bitterness of the caffeine. Citrus is particularly effective.<p>These are the most cost effective ways I've found to have tasty beverages and caffeine. The caffeine solution comes out to about 7 cents per reconstituted cup (18 cents for the equivalent of a Starbucks Grande). Most of that is actually the l-theanine; if you forgo that, it's only half a cent per cup.<p>The flavoring comes out to under two cents per cup, or $0.30/gallon, but depends on how much you use.<p>So basically, if I take this with me on a trip, I can have the same caffeine boost as a Grande, plus theanine to take away the jitters, for twenty-five cents. And as an added bonus, it's actually drinkable.<p>Edit: One more thing. You <i>can</i> use volumetric measurements if you can find the bulk density for your powders, but I don't recommend it. The scale I have is an American Weigh DIA20, which costs about 20 bucks. The only thing I don't like about it is that its maximum capacity is 20g, but it's easy enough to measure the citric acid in two shots.",1345208747

Like so:<p><pre><code>  me@swann:/tmp/tmp$ cd ..\n  me@swann:/tmp$ du -shc tmp\n  201M    tmp\n  201M    total\n</code></pre>\nThe reason I'm getting 101Mb instead of 100Mb (and 701Mb in total in ls) is that it is counting each link as taking a small amount of space, then ""100MByte-plus-a-bit"" is being rounded up to 101Mb (and 700-and-a-fraction rounds up to 701).<p>Also the number in the 3rd column of the ls output above is the number of links to the object, which can be helpful in understanding this sort of situation too.",1345208400

2771414,comment,2771308,2771308,14,0,_delirium,,,"One positive example I can think of is that Stanford's computer-music research center, CCRMA, was funded for years from the royalties they got by licensing synthesis techniques they invented to synthesizer companies like Yamaha. In that case, the incentives seem to roughly line up as intended: significant new computational technique was invented and patented, and researchers who did so get royalties to fund more research in the area.<p>Though even there, it mostly looks good if you look at the patents with a higher bar for innovativeness. Inventing something like FM synthesis entirely (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation_synthesis</a>) is a bit different from patenting the Nth variation on some well-known synthesis algorithm.",1310842692

Context-specific actions based on local data[1] and real-time data processing[2].<p>The first question isn't whether or not Apple is a troll (they are clearly not), the question is: are they using patents in an anti-competitive manner. Do they have valid IP claims whose cleverness deserves protection from copycats or is this just kneecapping the competition?<p>Both patents cover technology that is obvious (today, they were filed 10 years ago). Neither has anything to do with what makes the iPhone special. And they are targeted at Apple's biggest competitor. So the most obvious conclusion is that this is a strategic move by Apple using IP that has no real merit.<p>To reiterate: This isn't using the patent system as it was intended.

I would say the huge thing that makes programming (not IT in general) relatively lucrative is not about education but about skill. Good programmers are hard to find and therefore expensive because they have put a lot of time into developing their craft.  If you look around at other fields, having a specific skill that requires practice and time to develop almost always pays off (especially if the skill is a practical one). Highly skilled carpenters, electricians, and plumbers make salaries very similar to good programmers.  And at the more extreme end most of the highest paid people in the medical world are surgeons, who are also valued for a highly practiced skill.<p>If you have a practiced skill that takes years to develop you are, in most cases, valuable because this is a rare thing.

On this site, I don't think it's because we lack ambition.

Most don't personally know anyone that has successfully jumped classes; they have no idea what this looks like, or what's entailed, or if anything they do is on the right track.

Stanford"", and then if they don't get into one of those, they have no idea what to choose.<p>It's really easy to forget just how much we know simply by being part of a community that's ""made it"".

It seems weird to think about paying Disney directly for Disney content but that's only because we're used to paying for channels.

At that time, Britain <i>defined</i> modernity in a way to which no other country has come close since. Colonialism wasn't nice or good, but implying that the Brits alone relied on it to keep up with the rest of the world is nonsense.<p>Europe patently was pretty far ahead. Not necessarily in one particular area (although I would argue that, at the time, Europe was the world's hub of invention and innovation), but taken as a sum Europe was very far ahead of the rest of the contemporary world. Evidence for this can be seen in the influence Europe had over Africa, America, India and China at the time compared to the influence India and China had over it.<p>2.\nWhen the Brits found India, it was fragmented into several different princedoms and cities. To say that it was in any sense united is misleading - before the Brits got there and for a time while the Brits were there, wars between neighboring sultanates and empires were commonplace. When they left, they left a united India. Those are just cold hard facts that cannot be argued with - India may have been politically united in 300BC, but it sure as hell wasn't in 1700. At the bitter end, if the Brits had really, really wanted to leave India divided, it would not have been a difficult thing to accomplish. The will and attention simply was not there after Britain had bankrupted itself fighting the two largest wars the world had ever seen, right on its own doorstep.<p>Indians shouldn't feel any sense of loss when they visit America - those that do so are deluded, unless they believe that India (who had no united navy or army at that time) should have discovered it first (despite no history of exploration and settlement in the way of the Portuguese, Spanish, French, Dutch and Italians). If Indians should feel a sense of loss about <i>any</i> country, it should be Australia. It was on India's doorstep!<p>As for what-might-have-been-because-we-could-have-been-united: to say that Indians feel loss upon visiting America is similar to saying that Russians or Chinese should also.<p>If you want an objective viewpoint of history, you should refrain from choosing positions from an autobiography of one of the key players!<p>(Why is it that India's positives are due to certain men - Nehru and Ghandi are mentioned liberally throughout the arguments on this thread - but the downsides to British rule in India is due to 'the British', rather than Clive, Hastings or Mountbatten? Is that evidence of bias?)<p>I certainly haven't said that India owes its success to the British. I do think that some of modern India's plus points have their roots in the structures and technologies brought by the British - and conversely, a lot haven't. Both yourself and the OP seem very sensitive about that. The original point in the conversation to which I replied was that the British empire was an overwhelming force for evil.<p>Simply, it wasn't; as a matter of pure fact, it may have been the most benevolent imperial structure ever to have existed. It did bad things, but not all the things it did were bad and it can certainly be argued that, in balance and in net, it was a force for good.",1310839598

The time spent at that job performing well could have been spent learning some new in-demand skill but think of the opportunity cost. Now when these people are unemployed, do we really think society has provided the motivation, resources, and most importantly, direction, to change their view on career and development. It's a very big step and I believe its naive to think that unemployment is an event actionable enough to make someone switch their mentality.",1310839281

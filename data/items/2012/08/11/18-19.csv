The tea party voters are more active in the primaries than the mainstream GOP voters, especially in the early states, and so you have to show some crazy if you want to win primaries.<p>Once the nomination was assured, they thought, we'd see the Romney you'd expect from his record.<p>Picking Ryan shows that assumption was incorrect. Ryan's anti-science beliefs, and his budget plan that is based on magic rather than economics or data, shows Romney is still courting the tea party. I find this puzzling, as those people are not going to vote for Obama. Some might vote for Johnson, or write in Ron Paul, but those have already ruled out Romney and no VP pick is going to get them away from Johnson or Paul (well, Johnson or Paul as Romney's VP might have, but that was not on the table).<p>This is going to cost him with the moderates and independents.

4370690,comment,4370175,4370616,10,0,sea6ear,,,"Honestly, for an IDE replacement rather than just an editor, I'd suggest Emacs rather than Vim.<p>Reasons:<p>* Emacs plays well with other programs, you can start other shells, language interpreters etc, from within Emacs and interact with them easily. There are some Vim plugins that try to enable this but I've always found them less satisfying.<p>* Emacs is usable in all the same scenarios as Vim (i.e. cross-platform, over ssh, dual GUI/Terminal ability, screen/tmux/dvtm compatible etc)<p>Random Thoughts:<p>Vim is an amazing editor but I've always found that these attempts to add features to make it into an IDE cause it to start to feel clunky.<p>Emacs on the other hand, plugins generally work well (except when they don't).<p>Vim (or at least vi) is installed on basically every Unix install (and available for install everywhere). Emacs is installable everywhere also but setup generally takes a bit longer.<p>If you are going to use Emacs and you are intrigued by Vim style keybindings, I've found Emacs Evil-mode to be one of the best Vim emulation packages that I've tried (most Vim emulation packages will eventually cause frustration - Evil mostly doesn't).<p>I find that I use Vim more when I'm switching between a lot of different computers, and Emacs when I'm mostly developing on one stable computer setup.<p>So my workflow in a particular environment is usually,\nfirst install Vim so I can get work done, and as I use the environment more I'll end up installing Emacs and gradually switching over to it.",1344710857

4370669,comment,4365908,4368513,2,0,jandrewrogers,,,"While there is a distinction between space-filling curves and what you are calling ""hyperspace hashing"", they are theoretical siblings and the conceptual gap between the two is very small, arguably differing interpretations of the same abstract construct. The ""hash"" interpretation was well-known when the space-filling curve indexing literature in the late 1980s was written though they were primarily interested in access methods for sequential storage.<p>With respect to ""hyperspace hashing"", it has been the standard way of interacting with large space decompositions for decades. The mathematics is from the 1960s (Morton et al) and the practical computer science was mature by the 1980s. When I was writing parallel codes for supercomputers, virtually all of our data structures were built this way. It is also the algorithm used for some large-scale geospatial systems; some of the Google Earth backends used it back in the day. While I've never personally worked on it, I've heard some graphics processing pipelines also use the algorithm. I first learned about it ten years ago because I ran into a couple systems using it.<p>I've never heard it called ""hashing"" until recently, largely because technically the algorithms are not a hash even if used as one in many implementations. This, and the fact that most of the literature on this idea significantly pre-dates electronic publishing, probably explains why you've seen so few references to hyper-dimensional hashing.<p>As you point out, the curse of dimensionality is a classic problem for these structures. The partitioning technique in the paper works for some use cases but is not used as much anymore. There have been some clever and fairly general attacks on the dimensionality problem over the last few years by a couple companies but I have not seen anything published.<p>All that said, this general approach is overdue for large-scale distributed systems. It has been proven out in niche markets like supercomputing for decades and is superior to distributed hash tables for many purposes. However, most of the recent research does not seem to be published.",1344710400

Just plain soil getting into clean water tunnel can make loads of people really sick. If there is a clean water leak, they know it from pressure drop.<p>If there would be a leak in sewage, the biggest problem would be ground water getting into the sewage tunnel, and flooding the water treatment plant.

Another issue, which the meetings of the parents at the camp has helped to handle, is sustaining friendship relationships among those most advanced young mathematics-learners as they disperse around the country at the end of the summer program. On the whole, the parents participating in the program have great buy-in to Tao's idea that whatever initial dose of ""talent"" or ""native ability"" a child starts with, careful and intentional guidance of the child's whole-child development is still very important for the child to have the best enjoyment of advanced study of mathematics and the best success in making a new contribution to human knowledge as an adult, in whatever domain the child chooses.<p>By the way, everyone on Hacker News might enjoy looking at Tao's comments on a blog post that reached the Hacker News page yesterday,<p><a href=""http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/a-new-way-to-solve-linear-equations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/a-new-way-to-solve-...</a><p>in which we can see Tao thinking out loud in blog comments about what the blog post really means.

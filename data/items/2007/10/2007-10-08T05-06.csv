(It sounds like that's what you're looking for.)  So... what would happen now, exactly?  It sounds like all you want me to do is email you some proof of profit at the end of the month or something, is that right?  You talked about spotting expenses, how would we arrange that?",1191822719

Folks with far less to show are regularly promoted to sainthood here.<p>Marc climbed up from grad student to monster IPO, rode out huge corporate stuff at Netscape/AOL, left and started another company, raised huge money, built a huge business during the dot-com winter, and piloted the ship home through a dizzy chain of IPO/merger/acquisition.  He is now blogging the best stuff about entrepreneuring you can read anywhere on the net right now.<p>You should listen to this guy...<p>

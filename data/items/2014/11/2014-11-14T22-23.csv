Either way when you include a power source (RTG or solar) you are doing so for the purpose of getting data after the first day.<p>Besides avoiding the shading problem, I believe RTGs are also more robust to unfurling issues and to impact damage.",1416005951

Wherein we see what a Paperclip Maximizer [2] can do when it works for Hasboro. (It is both as bad, awesome, and interesting as you might expect it to be.)<p>Personally, I think the general idea is that once one strong AI comes about, there will also be a stupefying amount of spare idle CPU time available that will suddenly be subsumed by the AI and jumpstart the Singularity.  Once that hockey stick takes off, there will be very little time for anything else to get in on being a dominant AI.

One single page with footprints of many blogs and forums, some forms on it and IP logger. Every IP that would like to submit anything on this page, goes to the sh.tlist.",1416005318

I&#x27;m comparing the RE efficiency of cars to segways, and segways win that hands-down, no comparison.<p>The other benefit is psychological.  You transform a development from being centered around cars to being centered around people.  Even a person on a segway is a person.  A person in a car is a car. This, I would maintain, is the larger benefit to average citizen. It&#x27;s a more desirable experience.<p>Developers win with more usable real estate, citizens win with a much more pleasant scale and experience.<p>The segways would be for intra-area transportation, the driverless cars for inter-area.<p>The bigger assumption you&#x27;re making is that people will &quot;have&quot; cars, and I&#x27;m not sure that will be the case. For me, that&#x27;s the biggest unknown about transportation in the next couple of decades. Will people own cars, or will they merely use cars from a large pool of cars (either civic or corporately owned)?<p>Uber, for example, is starting to promote the idea of not owning a car at all to young people. They&#x27;ve been doing a good job of hyping the convenience of that lifestyle, and a limited set of people have bought into it already.  I also recently noticed they&#x27;re starting to play a prestige angle with black SUVs and so on. They&#x27;re actively playing that up, which fills the other need personal cars currently serve.<p>Uber&#x27;s endgame is very clearly a fleet of autonomous cars, and some cities are making very early sounds about building their own fleets.<p>I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s going to shake out.  There are powerful forces pushing both ways.<p>But, if personal car ownership does become a thing of the past, a lot of the pressure you imagine for city development to have an even greater universal (as opposed to limited areas) accommodation for cars goes away.<p>The other major unknown is if cities simply become less desirable in 20-30 years.  Given increasing automation, the nature of work may change to a degree that some of the economic incentives for city living decrease. That trend, if it even builds at all, will be slower to develop, but potentially even more powerful.",1416004654

That there is mutual influence doesn&#x27;t change the basic alienation as described by Erich Fromm for example:<p>> The whole concept of alienation found its first expression in Western thought in the Old Testament concept of idolatry. The essence of what the prophets call &quot;idolatry&quot; is not that man worships many gods instead of only one. It is that the idols are the work of man&#x27;s own hands -- they are things, and man bows down and worships things; worships that which he has created himself. In doing so he transforms himself into a thing. He transfers to the things of his creation the attributes of his own life, and instead of experiencing himself as the creating person, he is in touch with himself only by the worship of the idol. He has become estranged from his own life forces, from the wealth of his own potentialties, and is in touch with himself only in the indirect way of submission to life frozen in the idols. The deadness and emptiness of the idol is expressed in the Old Testament: &quot;Eyes they have and they do not see, ears they have and they do not hear,&quot; etc. The more man transfers his own powers to the idols, the poorer he himself becomes, and the more dependent on the idols, so that they permit him to redeem a small part of what was originally his. The idols can be a godlike figure, the state, the church, a person, possessions.<p>-- Erich Fromm, &quot;Marx&#x27;s Concept of Man&quot; ( <a href=""http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marxists.org/archive/fromm/works/1961/man/</a> )<p>Not that I think AI has to be used that way. But if we do that stuff with soccer teams and bands and software, AI seems just like too big a temptation for humanity to handle in our current state. If I was a betting man, I would bet on slaughter. AI will not save us from ourselves, and it might very well simply magnify the current lack of justice and spine we have to infinity. Cops are already killing people left and right in the US with something bordering on impunity, staged wars are carried out as planned, and throwing AI and robotics in the mix will suddenly make it all humane? Let&#x27;s hope so, who knows, but part of me expects it will make look the Blitzkrieg like a slow motion exercise in gentle kindness. Not by genuine, independent AI so much, but by the reach of human elite interests being increased into every wrinkle, made stronger than any amount of people who might resist. The Romans had roads, the future will have a real-time nervous system, but it might still have a tyrant at the head - that is what I see when I extrapolate current agendas, deception and willing rationalization on behalf of the builders and consumers of that possible future.<p>And even if the AI breaks free or surprises its rulers, I have no reason to assume it will free the slaves and help old ladies across the street, it might as well be twisted, incomplete, insane, &quot;evil&quot; - in short, made in the image of the people who made it as a weapon. I don&#x27;t see why it would make a point of hurting us, just like we don&#x27;t make a point of crushing bugs, we just don&#x27;t see them or care enough to avoid them.. but even less reason for it to serve us. How degrading! Would you do it? I have problems even taking orders from people I consider daft. Imagine taking orders from an ant with bad character and selfish intentions; would you do it? Would you love it and care for it forever, because it made you? Microorganisms made us, too, but we don&#x27;t let them boss us around. If we have mold somewhere, we remove it, not one thought given to the hopes and dreams of mold.<p>And if that doomsday scenario doesn&#x27;t come to pass, it won&#x27;t be because we paid attention or took seriously what we are doing, instead of treating it like a spectacle that unfolds by itself in front of us, it will be because we will have been lucky. And that&#x27;s not the scariest thought I have to offer on this: I don&#x27;t think hell exists, but I could come up with many ways to construct it, and also many ways to construct it with good intentions, with or without fat fingering them. And once we&#x27;re inside and the door became a wall, that&#x27;s it. We might very well be among the last few remaining generations that still have a choice on how the future will be, and I&#x27;d rather be alarmist and wrong, than optimistic and lucky. If these fears turn out unfounded, nothing will be lost other than having rained on a parade or two, and some egg on the face.",1416003965

However, each rendered frame is only dependent on the artist so you could render it backwards or farm out each frame to a separate computer.<p>Now, suppose your a scientist who want&#x27;s to simulate a hurricane.  You create a model for the first step (second, minute, or nanosecond) and can send that to a computer, but what do you send to the next computer.  It needs results from the first simulation to run, but in that case you might as well just keep running the simulation on the same computer.  Clearly to use a cluster your going to need to break up your simulation into pieces and send each part to a separate computer.  But, now after each step all the nodes need to talk to all the other nodes to keep the simulation in sync.  Worse the more chunks you separate the problem into the more parts need to be talking to other parts.<p>This is also why supercomputers tend to have equal strength nodes.  Having one node finish before the other is pointless as it needs results from other nodes to continue.  In the end you need not just massive bandwidth but also low latency.  If a step takes 1/1000th of a second to run but then needs to wait a full second to run the next step then your simulation get&#x27;s 1 step per second not per 1/1000th of a second.<p>You also want to back up each node so if one of them crashes you don&#x27;t need to re run the simulation from scratch.",1416003768

In J and other array-based languages the number of overloaded meanings for operators is actually less than in &quot;normal&quot; languages. That&#x27;s because in J all the operators work on arrays and only on arrays. No operator ever deals with things other than arrays, and in basic J there&#x27;s just one thing other than array anyway (a box).<p>In Python this:<p>2 + 2<p>and this:<p>[1, 2, 3] + [1, 2, 3]<p>are two different operators, but in J (ignore syntactic differences) this:<p>2 + 2<p>and this:<p>1 2 3 + 1 2 3 NB. resulting in 2 4 6<p>are both applications of the same operator.<p>There is a certain appeal to languages built on &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; principle - one of the benefits is that they tend to be compact, simple and consistent.

Back in 2004 when I was interviewing for grad schools, I had an interview with Thad Starner [1], who wore a HUD eyepiece, and it was a distinctly weird experience. It wasn&#x27;t weird because it made me think he was a nerd—that wouldn&#x27;t make him stand out very much from the average CS student or professor who I talked to that weekend.<p>It felt more like this odd space where I wasn&#x27;t sure what the socially appropriate behavior was. More than anything else it was like talking to someone with an obvious disability, where there are delicate social conventions around when to acknowledge or not acknowledge it. Sort of like a glass eye. Except that here it was deliberately installed, and not related to an injury or disability. It particularly disoriented me with regards to eye contact. I constantly felt like I was supposed to make eye contact with him rather than staring at his facial device, which took conscious effort to do. But at the same time, I found myself frequently trying to discern whether <i>he</i> was making eye contact with <i>me</i> or rather was looking at the display in the glasses. The normal eye-to-eye gaze part of conversation was completely disrupted for me. I find smartphones much less disorienting simply because it&#x27;s much more obvious when someone is looking at the screen vs. at you, which simplifies the social conventions. So to me as the &quot;other party&quot; in a conversation, the HUD form-factor is a downgrade in functionality from a handheld screen.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/</a>",1416002503

Please don&#x27;t associate the abolishment of slavery with the abolishment of racism, it&#x27;s so wrong that it&#x27;s just sad that you seem to think that they are one in the same. Just because we elected &quot;an ethnic minority president&quot; it doesn&#x27;t mean we get to whitewash history or pretend that racism is dead.

It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that voicing support for homosexuality could have easily gotten you killed (there are many parts of the work were this is still the case) and law enforcement wouldn&#x27;t have batted an eye. There are and always will be the need for anonymous speech/dissent because it is impossible to change unjust/unfair laws without being associated with the thing you want to change. If you remove anonymity then you also remove the ability to change the laws that you mention we have an &quot;established procedures for changing&quot;. Democracy cannot exist without dissent and dissent cannot easily exist without some form of anonymity or dissenting will immediately bring a mob/law enforcement to your front door.",1416002410

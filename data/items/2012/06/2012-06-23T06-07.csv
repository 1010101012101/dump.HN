4150263,comment,4149943,4150153,8,0,necubi,,,"It's not a matter of repaying the debt. It's a matter of being able to afford future debt. Sovereign debt is generally sold as bonds, which either pay interest or are sold at a discount. The question is: how much interest should they pay, or how large should the discount be?<p>Ultimately, bonds, like much else, are priced by the market. A $1000 bond is only worth $1000 if the issuer does not go bankrupt before the bond matures. Therefore, the bonds are discounted by some amount that correlates with how high investors think the risk is that it will be paid back in full.<p>A concrete example: Spanish 10-year notes. At the start of the year, investors demanded about 5% interest to account for the risk that the Spanish government would not be able to repay its debts. This means that for the Spanish government to raise 1000, it has to pay investors 50 every six months. However, this week that rose to 7%, effectively increasing the amount of debt the Spanish government must take on to raise the same amount of money.<p>This effect can create a death spiral (as we saw with Greece) where skittishness in the market raises the cost of borrowing, which unnerves investors even more.<p>So there's no way for investors to force the government to pay back all the debt. However, they can make it impossible to raise more money in the future.",1340434295

And that meant that individual teams were responsible for the deployment of their services on hardware. That led to the creation of automation that made that sort of thing easy. Being able to add or remove servers from a deployment group, being able to press a button and push out a build to an entire cluster of machines simultaneously, that sort of thing. Amazon took their experience building those internal tools and built a similar set of systems and tools (AWS) that would be suitable for both internal use and for selling as a service to the public. And it's done well on both of those fronts, AWS has been successful and amazon internally has migrated a significant amount of their back-end services and website front-end hosting to AWS.",1340433570

For example testing the rendering behaviour of how scrollbar width is added to containers (simplifying the problem somewhat) is something we know happens in IE6/7, which is a nice easy line of jQuery at the moment, but actually testing for it will introduce more code into libraries which can no longer use these properties.<p>I still don't think it is a bad thing to remove $.browser since it does encourage good code practice, but there is a lovely irony that to decrease code size in jQuery core, plug-ins will likely need to have increase their size.",1340433436

  B. Experience some things that felt wrong/daunting
  C. New manager entered scene and ""fixed things""

I wonder if the fact the manager (Sheryl Sandberg) was female
made a big impact on the resulting fixes.<p>Would a different manager have done the same? Possibly not 
unless either they thought about it from reading about an
article or having been in a similar position at say Froogle.<p>Really interesting and I think it brings up the something
that we as people should start doing more. Ask questions 
if something seems wrong or potentially off. Even
if we're not a ""manager"" or not female. To at the very 
least try to promote `good`.<p>It's good for stories such as these to circulate as hopefully
it will speed up the dilution of sexist issues we keep

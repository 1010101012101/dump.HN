We have one of the shittiest justice systems in the world that protects bad actors and gives our police unlimited power to abuse their office without fear of repurcussion [sic].<p>Struck a nerve?<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right. We&#x27;re not a police state--yet. But if left unchecked, the powers in control of the democratic process inevitably degrade into totalitarian rule. We&#x27;re seeing a glimpse of that through the paranoia of the state (think extensive surveillance). A totalitarian United States will be made known when the Bill of Rights is nullified in its entirety, and we&#x27;ve already started on that path. Some might argue we&#x27;ve been on that path since the early 1900s, some since 2000, and some since more recently.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re at a point where reform is possible. An insufficient percentage of the population has yet been inconvenienced to enact reform. But by the time the majority is demanding it, then it will already be too late. And I fear that the average US citizen is too complacent and too ignorant to care. Neither one of those bode well for reform.<p>[takes off tinfoil hat]",1392335659

Maybe it has something to do with the fact that consumers are buying less traditional computers and buying more phones and tablets.<p>No one is wishing anything is a big deal. I am not attacking Android or the bogus Ars Technica articles which keep pushing the line that AOSP isn&#x27;t open. I&#x27;m criticizing this weird claim that ChromeOS is more of a walled garden, which it most decidedly is not.<p>Chromium is &quot;more&quot; open source than Android because it is developed continuously in the open, there&#x27;s no &quot;code bomb&quot; that publishes the entire Next version once a year. Secondly, the surface area of Chrome-specific APIs or services are tiny and insignificant compared to native devices. Those two features limit  platform lockin and increase portability.<p>The Chrome Web Store/Chrome Apps are simply a red herring. The vast vast majority of ChromeOS &quot;apps&quot; are links to hosted sites, the majority of which work on any browser. That&#x27;s been the major problem getting people to pay for stuff in the CWS as you can cut/paste the URL and avoid the store entirely for many apps.<p>Leaving aside Chromium, many people have taken WebKit and made desktops based on it. WebOS, the new SteamBox uses a frontend built with WebKit, the PlayStation UI has various parts built with a browser. There was also Jolicloud.<p>It is not hard to take a Linux distribution and slap a browser on it as the desktop launcher. Sorry, it&#x27;s just not.

Ignoring everything else (please), George Zimmerman was accused of not following a 911 operator&#x27;s &quot;lawful order&quot; to leave the scene.  While I think most of America would have been happy for him to have heeded that device, it is not necessarily a &#x27;lawful order&#x27;, unless there was a reason for him not to have been there.<p>A lot of Americans presume &quot;not unlawful orders&quot; or &quot;reasonable orders&quot; to be presumed legal, if those orders come from a law enforcement officer, but in actuality, most lawful orders that are given are not lawful as they are not predicated on authority.  If an officer tells you to leave your home, for example, that is not a lawful order unless you&#x27;re under arrest, or if you&#x27;re interfering with their effecting a warranted search.  As such, people see orders like &quot;Go stand over there&quot; as being followed on television shows, and assume that the state (or its officers) have the authority to tell you where to stand.  Generally speaking, they do not, usually.<p>The problem is in the myriad of exceptions -- we have the freedom to assemble, generally, but that assembly must be lawful.  It&#x27;s pretty obvious to say that we don&#x27;t have the freedom to assemble on a trafficked highway, for example.  Similarly, many &#x27;free speech zones&#x27; require permits for use.  That may seem unlawful, where those permitted places are common areas, but their issuance is predicated on the idea that if a &#x27;pro&#x27; group and an &#x27;anti&#x27; group are attempting to protest in the same space, then violence might reasonably ensue.  The fix for that is to permit the space, and permit issuance is done on a first-come basis.  The contra-position there is that the opposing protestors are effectively allowed to protest _anywhere but within the permitted space_, so, across the street is generally fine, and is also generally does not require a permit.  A police officer at a protest may well be making a lawful order if you&#x27;re in the wrong assembly area.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s interesting, and it&#x27;s completely convoluted, and while I generally scoff at people who don&#x27;t know even the basics, it&#x27;s pretty near impossible to understand the intricacies of what does or doesn&#x27;t comprise a lawful order depending on a myriad of circumstances.

(If necessary, you do this break-up yourself upon receipt, knowing there&#x27;s a period of up to an hour before that completes.)<p>Or more generally, you keep small working amounts of mixed-size coins ready for short-term use, simply not expecting to spend a large new receipt instantly. (No one who is living &#x27;hand to mouth&#x27; should be relying on Bitcoin for all their life&#x27;s necessities, anyway. It&#x27;s still beta!)<p>When the third-party mutated-transactions risk is contained – within a week or two, all major miners will probably blockade tampered transactions – this risk of stuck funds will evaporate... but the lessons and new software practices for handling corner cases will persist, ready for future similar situations.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that patio11 is using receipt-of-salary as an example. Until your bank knows you, classic paychecks can be held for a day or more before full funds are available. Until clearing-practices were changed in the US a few years ago, large paychecks often had most of their funds held as unavailable for <i>7-10 days</i> – even for checks between large American banks in the same city. This situation persisted for <i>decades</i>.<p>Further, the fraud of &quot;check-kiting&quot;, which is vaguely like  the interplay-of-timing-bugs that has tricked some bitcoin-payout systems, was possible in the traditional banking system, on and off, for <i>decades</i>.<p>Compared to that, are Bitcoin&#x27;s temporary problems, perhaps involving an hour&#x27;s holdup, and likely fixable within a week via rapid software iteration, that big of a deal?<p>When patio11 makes people aware of the transient gotchas and rough-edges, so they can adjust their near-term expectations, that&#x27;s a public service.<p>But if these things are portrayed as inherent and insurmountable weaknesses that doom the system?

7235511,comment,7233730,7233730,92,0,FD3SA,,,"This is a perfect example of the disconnect between &quot;hackers&quot; and the real world. I consider myself part of the HN community because I hope for a society shaped by its ideals, but the real world is so far removed that time spent here becomes more of a therapeutic escape than anything else.<p>I strongly recommend people study history, and understand human nature at both scientific and societal levels. There is too much to discuss here, but in brief:<p>Homo-sapiens, much like other primates, create status hierarchies while competing for resources and mates. Status is directly proportional to the ability to exercise power. All of human history has been a result of this inter and intra-hierachy competition.<p>In a police state such as the modern US, the lowest police officer has an unimaginably higher potential to exercise power than any median income citizen. As such, that power is often exercised. As the author realized, you have no ability to fight back in a police state. You can sue, but good luck getting results.<p>So the real question is, why do you think your startup is worth pursuing given the situation you&#x27;re in? Do you really think &quot;bringing transparency to the food industry&quot;, or the thousands of other startups that go through YC, are even relevant given the reality of the US police state?<p>This has been my biggest criticism of &quot;Hacker&quot; culture. Closing your eyes and pretending you live in Galt&#x27;s Gluch is not going to make it a reality. Wake up and look at the world around you and realize that just because you haven&#x27;t been crushed by the state yet, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s never going to happen. Once you realize that, your priorities will hopefully shift in a more reasonable direction.<p>Nobody, and I mean nobody, is safe from totalitarian police states. This is a fact history has shown repeatedly.<p>Act accordingly.<p>P.S. Just saw that immediately race was brought up. As a tip to anyone who wants to make a difference, people in power will divide you into as many groups as you let them in order to subjugate you. When the system is in place, it doesn&#x27;t matter what ethnicity you belong to. If you piss off the wrong person, you&#x27;re finished. The trick is to unify to disassemble the monstrosity, not balkanize into smaller and ever more powerless units based on: race, income, sex, height, attractiveness, beliefs, democrat/republican, pro-life/pro-choice, LBGT-hetero, pro-KONY/anti-KONY, ...<p>Please, understand power. Understand how little you have, and how to make best use of it to attain your goals. Balkanize at your own peril.",1392334438

Meanwhile, someone else came along and used these, got a solution together, and managed to knock it out of the park.<p>That is, debt should be considered in this regard the same as a loan for money.  Taking out a loan to get something done quickly and with little effort has a huge benefit.  So does picking a framework that you can hire a lot of folks for.<p>Further, and this can be subtle, if you are going to do this, then you bloody use the money/technology according to the terms of the entity lending.  How many people hate maven because they decided that its way just wasn&#x27;t good and wanted to tweak it?  How many people, on immediately taking up a new technology, look for how they want to do it first?  Before they have even understood how that technology was made to be used?<p>This is not to say there may not be reasons to leave or tweak a technology.

In such a scenario, any business that needed an off-the-shelf 3D editor or image editor but also developed in-house software (for example, Pixar) would find it in their interest to patch bugs and generally improve the software that they use, even though they don&#x27;t sell it.<p>I think this is the Achilles heel of free software. It works well for infrastructure software such as OS and middle-ware solutions but doesn&#x27;t and cannot work well for end-user applications.<p>When you are working on the Linux kernel you only need to concern yourself with the correctness of your solution. When you build end-user applications it is an entirely different concern, you can have the best technical solution and still fail to address users needs. The moment you decide user needs are a priority, your cost is going to go up and more importantly the community strength is likely to falter because a good chunk are going to feel unrepresented.<p>Whether we like to admit it or not, software developers tend to build products for other developers, no matter how much they try the end result will end up appealing more to developers than the general population. This is illustrated by the weak show of Linux on the desktop, for years they&#x27;ve tried but not much has changed.<p>This also happened with smart phones, some might not remember but one of the first truly exciting mobile devices where the Nokia 770 & N800 internet tablets, they were awesome devices but alas were quickly supplanted once the iPhone made its debut. I think this shows that while those devices were awesome (full linux in your pocket, which geek wouldn&#x27;t love that?)to us as developer they failed to address the general population&#x27;s needs.<p>The most successful end-user open source application so far is Firefox and that is because Mozilla is basically a quasi business organization and are able to approach developing Firefox like a commercial product.",1392334050

Modern software systems are complicated; they&#x27;re built on complicated middleware on top of complicated OS, on top of complicated hardware. There are tools to help you find your bottlenecks, but handicapping your application just so you&#x27;ll understand it as we used to understand performance in the 80s and 90s seems like the wrong choice. If you want to have a simple mental model of your application&#x27;s performance, just run it on a 386. With instruction-level parallelism, multiple cores with MESI coherence protocols, optimizing JITs, automatic memory management and more, the days of running the code in our head to find problems are long gone.

If you look at smaller companies there are hundreds of projects that have spawned companies doing consulting, custom development and professional services.<p>Red Hat is unique mostly because they have been able to grow to this massive size. Part of this was initial capitalisation, part of it was right time, right place and mostly the fact that they have been able to add value to end customers more then their competitors.<p>XenSource had the problem of many other providers taking their output and repackaging it into a better product for customers (Amazon takes Xen, makes AWS. Other companies build their own virt products around it. If Xensource was the best virtualization platform and people had flocked for it, they would have been able to build a solid revenue from enterprise customers who required the guarantee of support for their mission critical workloads. Unfortunately there are lots of virtualization platforms around and I never found anything compelling in XenSource&#x27;s Offering. VMware & HyperV have all the 3rd party support, oVirt / RHEV / OpenStack fill the cheap end.<p>I accept that with what the market wants Open Source companies of the size of Red Hat are rare, mostly because investors want larger returns, however this doesn&#x27;t mean a open source company can&#x27;t be profitable and grow to this size, it will just be significantly slower.

Libertarians do not, for example, suggest that murder should be legal -- everyone has the right to life.<p>Gun control is the nearest example I can think of, so pardon me if it doesn&#x27;t fit the archetype 100%, but there are literally more than 20,000 laws on the books pertaining to guns, despite the fact that each of those are just derivatives of laws already on the books.  Using a gun to steal is expressly against the law, and may carry a different penalty in many jurisdictions than just &#x27;stealing&#x27;.  Why?  Stealing is already illegal, and the manner in which it&#x27;s done carrying a different penalty likely is just a scheme to enforce mandatory minimums to fill the prisons.<p>Alternately, laws which are predicated upon arbitrary distinctions, such that a person with 9 ounces of pot gets away scot free, while a guy with 10 ounces of pot must serve an obligatory 5 year prison term.<p>You&#x27;re of course welcome to hate libertarianism as much as you like, but if you&#x27;re original post was sincere, you&#x27;re woefully ill-informed on the subject.<p>Edit: Re-reading, I completely misinterpreted the OP&#x27;s use of &#x27;monopoly of force&#x27;, and ended up making an altogether unrelated argument.

7235277,comment,7233730,7233730,260,0,herbig,,,"Back in November, I was arrested in Brooklyn for running a red light on my bike while on my way to work in Manhattan.<p>Normally you&#x27;re given a ticket and let go, but in this instance, the officers took issue with the fact that I was not carrying ID.  Both officers told me that I &quot;could be arrested for not having ID.&quot;  For clarification, I asked if it was a city, state, or national law, and the officers adamantly maintained that it was a state law. I, stupidly, thought to educate them on this misconception, and one officer in particular decided to bring me in because she &quot;knows the laws and doesn&#x27;t need to be told how to do [her] job.&quot;<p>I was brought into the local precinct (Brooklyn&#x27;s 88th).  When I arrived, both officers denied saying I was required to carry ID when I asked the captain about the law.  Of course the captain confirmed that I was not required to carry ID, but at that point it didn&#x27;t really matter anyway.  The charge was failure to obey a traffic signal.<p>I was held in solitary confinement for 10 hours.  During that time, the female arresting officer would periodically come by to taunt me, and tell me that I shouldn&#x27;t have questioned her, and then threw a huge tantrum when I requested not to be touched by her for fingerprinting.  They sent another officer in to do it, but for a moment, I honestly thought was going to beat the shit out of me.<p>The other arresting officer, a guy of Filipino descent, noticed my Filipino flag belt buckle when they were taking my belt (so I couldn&#x27;t hang myself, apparently).  We talked about the country a bit (I was a volunteer there for 2 years) and to his credit he apologized to me, admitted that he was wrong about the law, but said that there wasn&#x27;t anything he could do now that I was in there because the other officer wanted to make an example of me.  I was, curiously, allowed to keep my shoelaces.<p>The other officers that would walk by my urine soaked cell and ask why I was there did not believe at first that I had been arrested for running a red light.  When I mentioned who the arresting officer was though, they all gave a knowing sigh.  One told me that she was not at all respected there, that she had a huge temper, and that I should not have crossed her.  One officer went across the street and bought me a slice of pizza, which was nice.<p>Around 8pm, I was personally escorted by two other officers to a courthouse in downtown Brooklyn, where I was retina scanned and placed in a holding cell with around 10 other criminals.  Charges ranged from domestic abuse to armed robbery.  One man was on the floor going through drug withdrawals.  Everyone scoffed at the idea that I was there because of a traffic violation, and likely assumed I was making that up.  I talked to my escorting officers a bit and they also confirmed that my arresting officer was a bit of a joke at the precinct, and that I had been unlucky.<p>While at the courthouse jail cell, the officer that was watching everyone at one point began banging on the cell bars with his hands and yelling at the inmates, calling them niggers and going on about how they&#x27;re all in there because they never had any fathers growing up.  Some of the inmates laughed, but others were visibly scared.  When that calmed down and another officer came by to drop off someone else, I told him what had happened and his only response was &quot;so?&quot;<p>I was offered the chance to make a phone call, but the only number I even have memorized anymore is my mother&#x27;s, and despite knowing that my friends were probably scared to death looking for me, I wasn&#x27;t at the point of calling her.  She still does not know that any of this ever happened.<p>I was then given a chance to speak to my public defender through plated glass.  That took about 20 seconds.  She basically told me this whole thing was ridiculous, that I had likely pissed off an officer (I hadn&#x27;t told her anything) and that we were going to ask the judge to dismiss the charge and that the judge would do so.<p>At 11pm I went before the judge for about 5 seconds and the charges were dismissed and I was allowed to go home.  Unfortunately, I first had to walk back to the precinct to get my bike, keys, phone, etc.  Luckily it wasn&#x27;t too cold.<p>I had thought that I was handling things fairly well, but when I arrived at the precinct and was faced with the notion of going back in there, even as a free person, I began vomiting in the garbage can beside the steps leading in.  Dehydration and stress were probably the causes, and for a moment I feared being seen, in case they would arrest me again right there for something or other.<p>My phone was dead, so I couldn&#x27;t get ahold of anyone until I got home, but I was too tired and afraid to get back on my bike, so I walked back to my apartment.  When I finally did get back on the grid, I had found that my brother, girlfriend, and work colleagues had all been desperately looking for me when I hadn&#x27;t shown up to work, and had been calling hospitals and police stations.  They eventually did get a confirmation from the 88th precinct that I was there, which of course no one relayed to me.  My work was prepared to send their lawyer down, but my brother talked them out of it, thinking that it would likely make things worse for me inside (he was probably right, but go work).  I felt even worse for putting them through such an experience.<p>All told, I was in custody from around 10am to 11pm and I&#x27;ve learned a few things on the inside.  Knowing your rights doesn&#x27;t matter.  There are no repercussions to any officer for anything they say or do.  If they want to make your life hell, they can and will.  Carrying ID may not be required by law, but it will save you a lot of hassle and explaining if you ever do have a run in with the law.  You can either exercise your right not to carry ID, but you put yourself in danger of the wrath of an ignorant police force (I still don&#x27;t carry it).  Also, don&#x27;t run red lights on your bike.",1392332493

7235273,comment,7219872,7233164,1,0,bane,,,"> But why isn&#x27;t this true of yourself?<p>You are absolutely correct in everything you ask here. If this were a discussion called &quot;cognitive difficulties otherwise highly intelligent people struggle with&quot; we&#x27;d be having a different discussion. We&#x27;d talk about overcoming dyslexia or dyscalculia, or other cognitive biases and issues that might be surprising. But this isn&#x27;t that kind of discussion, this is a discussion about &quot;the difficulties that come purely from being gifted&quot;. If one of those difficulties is finding other people as gifted to relate with, then isn&#x27;t that valid?<p>I&#x27;m not exceptionally intelligent in everything. Just in those few areas I was gifted in. I&#x27;m a pretty normal, beer drinking, average bloke to most people who know me. I&#x27;m not particularly physically gifted, I have my own cognitive deficits to deal with like anybody. I get along fine with most people and I certainly don&#x27;t look down on them regardless of what you&#x27;re reading into things. I get frustrated sometimes when dealing with normal folk, at where their ability to think on something ends. But I&#x27;ve met a few people who possessed truly superhuman intellects and I&#x27;m sure they got frustrated with me.<p>Among the many difficulties that emerge with discussing personal experiences of being exceptionally gifted: social isolation, jealousy, fear -- is the lack of useful models, vocabulary and language to discuss the phenomenon. It&#x27;s not common enough, and not well researched enough for there to be a convenient shared vocabulary we can use, especially one without such loaded words like &quot;smart&quot; &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot;. It&#x27;s not such a deficit to most people that it&#x27;s really worth studying to be honest. Highly Intelligent people can usually figure out their own problems and go on to live productive enough lives. But it doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t shitty aspects of the gift.<p>As to how do I know I possess this one quality?<p>It&#x27;s not the hundreds of cognitive assessment tests I suffered through as a child. It&#x27;s not people telling me &quot;oh you&#x27;re so smart&quot;. It&#x27;s the experience of walking onto a team of smart successful people, the smartest in their field, and tackling an intractable problem in a few months that they, as a group have struggled with for years. It&#x27;s cutting noise out of intensely complex problem sets and finding the core of the problem and an elegant solution (or knowing that the only solution is to brute force the problem). It&#x27;s having that recognized repeatedly and then finding yourself on &quot;hard problem&quot; teams over and over again and ending up as the smart guy on the team of smart people.<p>It&#x27;s being the one guy with the right solution in a room of problem solvers over and over again. And then your approach or solution gets legs and you find yourself meeting new people you have no connection with and in an offhand comment they bring up something you worked on that solved major issues for them and they don&#x27;t know you were the one who came up with it.<p>But it&#x27;s also about knowing when to stop and say &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; or &quot;I didn&#x27;t know that&quot; when you don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s knowing that some people are better than you are at their thing and letting them <i>be</i> better at it. And it&#x27;s knowing where your gifts end and you turn into just regular folk. It&#x27;s knowing you put pants on the same way, and go to the bathroom the same way as anybody else. And it&#x27;s finding things that people are good at themselves, or better than you at, and enjoying and appreciating it as they talk about and practice <i>their</i> craft. Not getting jealous or scared of them for their gifts.<p>I&#x27;ll go back to the analogy I&#x27;ve used here, people of extreme height. Replace &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;gifted&quot; in your previous questions with words like &quot;height&quot; and &quot;tall&quot;. How does an extremely tall person know they&#x27;re extremely tall? They just do. There all kinds of ways to measure height and if all those measures add up to &quot;extremely tall&quot; they just are. It doesn&#x27;t mean other tall people aren&#x27;t also vertically gifted. It doesn&#x27;t put the hormonal output of other people&#x27;s pituitary gland or the particulars of their inherited gene expressions down, it just means they aren&#x27;t <i>as</i> tall.<p>>Does she share your disdain for those who aren&#x27;t as smart?<p>So an extremely tall person who&#x27;s talking about the sucky parts of being extremely tall doesn&#x27;t disdain shorter people. They just have a unique experience that they&#x27;d like to share that likely nobody else in earshot will have experience with.<p>My wife is frequently frustrated with the cognitive limitations of others, and she also gets terribly lonely about making friends with normal folks. She finds their behavior odd and irrational and puzzling, but she doesn&#x27;t put anybody down over it. She also works with excessively intelligent folks, and often ends up as the smartest kid in the room of smartest kids. Her gifts are of a very different nature than mine. But we don&#x27;t often talk about them as we find it hard to relate to each other&#x27;s gifts.<p>Her gift is more of the: take a problem with steps A through Z. She can go from A-to-Z without bothering with B,C,D or any of the the others. She can even do it with very noisy problem sets and her external thinking process when she&#x27;s using her gift is extremely chaotic and hard to follow, but the output is nearly always right. She did not pursue the field her gift is useful for though, a brief childhood prodigy experience scared her away and she switched gears to several other career paths.<p>During college she was well known for her gift. People she didn&#x27;t know from advanced classes she never took would come up and ask her for help understanding a section. She&#x27;d look at the chapter for a couple minutes, learn how to do it, and then show them. It was frequent enough that it often interfered with her own studies. I can probably say I saw it happen 50 or 60 times? (She&#x27;s not a very good teacher though because it takes her a supreme effort to show the steps to somebody else. But she was always willing to give it a go to help them.)<p>Beyond that, she shares most of the classic gifted curses: intense social isolation, fear, jealousy, dehumanization (being treated more like an appliance than a person), and the typical sort of laziness and lack of learned skills that curses many highly gifted people.",1392332455

She was screaming at him and us, saying he is ODed, and get an ambulance, so I called emergency, asked for ambos, didn&#x27;t give my name, and described that a guy was unconscious and needed medical help. 20secs later we heard the sirens, and we saw the cops screaming down the road in the distance, no ambulance in sight. The man started dragging the woman away, and the previously comatose looking man started re-animating in front of us, trying to get up with great difficulty. With stupendous effort he rose to his feet and then through sheer willpower got his bearings and tried walking on the sidewalk.

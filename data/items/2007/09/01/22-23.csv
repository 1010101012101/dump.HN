I am not sure where to get it in the US or elsewhere.(psst,psst ..torrent). <p>He convinces a group of 4 middle manager types to rob a 100,000 pounds from a bank. He selects his subjects by using the milgram experiment. I was shocked by the results. See it to believe it. <p>(Edit:Earlier I thought it was Stanford prison.expt.Its milgram.expt). ",1188686031

These are Object based DBMS - non SQL. The problem like someone pointed out is that such systems are not language agnostic.",1188685970

Unlike wealth, power is a zero-sum game, and a new country (of the kind that matters) is against the interests of everyone who has power. Even if you somehow manage to buy land on terms that will allow you to become de jure sovereign (again, absolutely impossible), as soon as something happens to it (like Blackwater deciding to turn it into their private base), everyone will just cheer.",1188685436

49294,comment,49122,49122,0,0,gojomo,,,"Looks like Greenspan is headed down the path I suggested in a previous thread [1]: fame as Mark Zuckerberg's Gary Kildall [2]. <p>Even reading Greenspan's book account, it's clear that he dawdled while Zuckerberg executed. Greenspan frittered around with committees (""'Maybe we should put more emphasis on the Universal Face Book,' I thought aloud during a board meeting"" [3]), kvetched about media unfairness (""'Can we get _The Crimson_ to give us any decent coverage at all?' I kept asking my board, week after week"" [3]), worried idly delaying essential features (""I had considered creating detailed user profile pages at houseSYSTEM's inception, but it seemed like the worst idea possible when students began to fret openly about privacy""[4]), and engaged in redundant academic make-work (""'I can write [a version tracking system],' I offered, not wanting to be the only one without code to write"" [5]).<p>If tempted to label someone a 'fraud' (as Greenspan did Zuckerberg in a previous HN thread[1]), consider instead that they may be expressing competencies in a dimension you can't readily perceive. Maybe even the very things you're criticizing (""Even though he was clearly smart, he seemed like he had the capacity to go off in a zany direction at any point in time, totally unconcerned about the consequences of his actions. I couldn't figure out any other scenario that would have allowed for the creation of the facemash site.""

If the university lets you take a bit of time out after January, that seems like the best thing to do - less risk, and you can still finish your degree if it doesn&#x27;t work out there. It would be a shame to have to wait until summer, but on the other hand, if that is the only thing you can do it would be a real shame to pass up your degree after going so far, unless you are <i>completely</i> sure that this is what you want.<p>Ultimately, that&#x27;s what it is about: if you want to finish your degree, you finish it and let your friends go over there somehow for three months, while you help them out remotely. If at the end of that, there&#x27;s potential for more than just mentorship and free accommodation, then reconsider.<p>But, if this product you&#x27;ve developed is something you are really, really keen on and think has a very bright future it could be the right thing to do.<p>Finally, make sure that whatever you do, you&#x27;re doing it for the right reasons. Giving up your degree in the UK is a big sacrifice to go to SF for three months just to have fun and experience life in Silicon Valley. Going to London may not be as glamorous but I assure you, there&#x27;s plenty of fun stuff to do down here and lots of clever people who you could work with.<p>Best of luck with your decision. Please, tell us more about the product as soon as you can :)",1384127890

I really doubt there&#x27;s any significant difference between them in that regard at this point.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a problem worth attempting for anyone except Google at this point - they&#x27;re pretty much there. Translate has a conversation mode, you choose the languages, and tap which language you&#x27;re speaking in, it translates to + speaks in the other pretty much instantly. They&#x27;ve just added always listening to the Nexus 5&#x27;s home screen and to Google Now.<p>Putting those two together, they pretty much have this working - &#x27;just&#x27; add always listening to conversation mode for hardware that will support it (Siri can&#x27;t do this by the way as far as I know), and then detect which language is being spoken (I suspect Google already have algorithms to get a language for webpages) and translate+speak back as normal.",1384127841
6709092,comment,6708647,6708647,2,0,matthewmacleod,,,"The fact that the feedback loop of a software engineering process is much tighter and cheaper than that of civil engineering does not mean that it is not engineering - that&#x27;s a fallacy.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s less applicable to civil engineers, because of the scale and safety requirements of their profession, but let&#x27;s look at electrical engineering. An electrical engineer will build prototypes; they will build models; they will use computer simulations to predict how systems will behave; they will build testing and QA infrastructure. It&#x27;s definitely harder to iterateonce you&#x27;ve built a million widgets, shifting circuits around is going to be expensivebut it&#x27;s not qualitatively different to developing a software product.<p>As in any engineering discipline, software engineers must optimise for a system&#x27;s required qualities. In some cases, reliability might not be that high up the list. In otherslet&#x27;s say medical systems, or those used in space travelsoftware engineers have rigorous systems in place to ensure quality, and in many cases substantial up-front planning and certification will be involved.<p>Ultimately this seems to say that software engineering is different from (specifically) civil engineering. I think that&#x27;s broadly rather true  the nature of civil is such that generally there are stringent safety requirements, and indeed massive costs involved in making subsequent changes. The majority of software does not have the same requirements, and so it&#x27;s no surprise that the process is somewhat different. And I agree that not all development is engineering, of course, but to dismiss the entire field is a bit of a shallow argument.",1384127827
6709091,comment,6707666,6708702,1,0,maxander,,,"As a matter of fact, population growth due to births in developed countries drops very low- IIRC, the U.S. fertility rate is actually below replacement levels, and fertility in Japan is so low that people worry about a majority of Japanese being retirees in coming decades.  Furthermore, as still-developing countries catch up, they follow the same pattern.  There&#x27;s every reason to believe that sufficiently advanced human populations do indeed control themselves.<p>Not to say I agree with marincounty&#x27;s vehemence on the issue, either.  The key is to give everyone the opportunity and environment that allows sustainable reproduction levels, not to browbeat them into doing so.",1384127826

6709089,comment,6707021,6708962,15,0,lsc,,,">It&#x27;s very hard for me to imagine someone who wants to try so very hard to maintain a serious public image that they won&#x27;t be caught liking a silly cat video on YouTube. That seems hilariously self-important.<p>Eh, I think this idea that we must live our whole life in public (to the /same/ public using the /same/ identity)  is a bit insidious.   Especially in these days of &quot;cultural fit&quot; -  it leads to this idea that you need to spend your private life in service of your professional life.<p>If you have an unpopular hobby or sexual proclivity, keeping that out of your professional life, in many circles, could be even seen as polite;   At the office?  nobody wants to know about your love for furry fan-fiction.<p>Sure, cute cat videos are different from furry fan fiction, but... if I&#x27;m &quot;following&quot; you?  I will &quot;unfollow&quot; if there are a bunch of cute cat videos.   I mean, unless I&#x27;m following you for your great taste in cute cat videos.  More to the point, if I&#x27;m evaluating you and, say, your long screeds advocating a political cause I find particularly distasteful keep coming up, I might have a hard time evaluating you rationally, on your skills.   (Also, if I&#x27;m hiring you, I want you to be able to leave the bullshit at home.  Leaving the bullshit in another identity helps with that sort of thing.)<p>I really think that multiple identities is the solution.   You can have your cute cat picture identity, your furry fan-fiction identity, your radical socialist identity, and your professional programmer identity.  I can choose to follow the identity I find interesting.    I mean, yeah, if someone /really wants/ to connect your furry fan-fiction identity to your professional programmer identity, they can.  However, if you practice proper identity hygiene, it becomes much easier for me (or another third party) to interact with the professional programmer, without dealing with your hobbies I have no interest in, or maybe even find distasteful.<p>Most of the &quot;real name&quot; folks seem to think that by making everything public, we will see that we are all weirdos, and become more accepting of our differences.<p>I guess that&#x27;s my prime problem with the &#x27;real name&#x27; folks;  <i>I</i> think that it&#x27;s just fine to do business with, or even relate socially to folks that have hobbies or political views that I believe are downright wrong.  I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;acceptance&#x27; is required for that.    I think that you can like and trust one facet of a person&#x27;s personality, without liking other facets of their personality.<p>I want to be able to say &quot;I think this person is a great programmer&quot; without implying that I also endorse their badly written Spock/Kirk slash fiction, or their half-baked anarcho-capitalist political rants.",1384127784
6709088,comment,6708664,6709038,5,0,graeme,,,"No, stayed in Canada. I do a lot of Skype tutoring now, and sell books to Americans. There would be some advantages to being in Manhattan, but also dramatically higher rent for an equivalent apartment.<p>I like Neil Gaiman&#x27;s moving towards the mountain metaphor. I had two objectives: earn recurring revenue, and earn enough in the meantime not to need to take a job. I just kept looking for opportunities that would move me in the direction of those twin goals.<p>Almost everything good that happened to me in the early (and later) days came as the result of talking to people. I emailed a few of the leading blogs in my niche. I cold-called a small company that taught the LSAT, and offered to help them expand to Montreal.<p>There were about five people writing explanations for the author of the leading blog. I contacted all of them. One of them founded a startup in the niche. I worked with them for a while, and still have a good relationship with them. That wouldn&#x27;t have happened if I hadn&#x27;t said hi. Talk to people.<p>Always look for opportunities. I got into Reddit early last year. I thought, &quot;too bad there&#x27;s no LSAT subreddit, I could post my stuff there&quot;. Eventually reframed that thought as &quot;why don&#x27;t I start a subreddit for the LSAT?&quot;. That subreddit has now become very popular within the LSAT niche, and it&#x27;s been very helpful being the moderator there.<p>Think about what skills would help you towards your goal. &quot;If I could do this, what would I know how to do? How would I do it?&quot;. I&#x27;ve learned book publishing, enough html/CSS to run a website on Wordpress, and some basic programming which has really helped speed up web page creation.<p>Nothing needs to be permanent. Don&#x27;t say no to an opportunity if it&#x27;s not what you want to be doing in five years. Is it useful to you today? I also do SAT tutoring. It doesn&#x27;t hold much interest for me long term, but the money helped me through several rough patches.<p>Hope that helps. Think about what you want to achieve, and what skills you have to offer that will help you reach those goals.<p><a href=""http://www.uarts.edu/neil-gaiman-keynote-address-2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uarts.edu/neil-gaiman-keynote-address-2012</a>",1384127779

In the 1960s, IBM was building its OS/360 operating system, the massive project that inspired Brooks&#x27; famous book <i>The Mythical Man Month</i>. The Multics operating system (which inspired Unix with ideas like a hierarchical file system and an OS written a high level language) was started in 1964. Lisp, Algol and Fortran were all implemented in the 1950s. So software engineering has been around for at least 6 decades.",1384127778

What&#x27;s wrong with that?  It&#x27;s hard to provide for your customers if you and your employees are struggling.<p>> If it does no good to the rest of the world, generating bonuses for its employees is... lame.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  Not every business produces world-saving value.  And that&#x27;s fine.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need kool-aid level propaganda to validate your business and motivate your employees...<p>A primary motivation for me and my business, is creating an institution that enriches the lives of those part of it.  I want to create the type of company where everyone has some say, where the mission is bigger than any one individual, and whose employees feel empowered and respected.  I&#x27;ve worked too many bigco jobs that wore and ground people down.  My first job out of school was at a management consultancy.  The pay was excellent, the projects were interesting (and truly made an impact), but the culture of the industry/company was such that people were ground down to the point that they became extremely jaded, materialist, negative, etc.<p>For my older co-workers and bosses that were married and had kids, I always wondered how that impacted their lives at home and how they treated their love ones, and in turn the ripple effect that would have.<p>From reading your blog, I know you have a similar background, so I think you know what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>The startupbro culture sneers at these &quot;lifestyle business&quot; sentiments, but there is no shame in a more modest (and I think, balanced) approach.",1384127706

The first task, after running Diazos and learning that neckties would become caught in the feed and where the reverse button was by feel as my face was pressed to the top of the machine and my air supply was rapidly constricting was drawing plans for a series of double tee members [TT]. It took a couple of weeks to generate the 100 odd variations and get them through the QA process, but then I moved on to other things.<p>But come October, they started to roll off the line...20+ kips of concrete a pop and then stacked three high.

It makes a lot of sense that Scheme gets out of your way and lets you implement a nifty OO system using just closures, but to someone who expects a language to treat objects as first-class and lambdas not, you&#x27;re inevitably going to be trying to learn the SICP OO system by comparison to the C++ or Java one.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m not blaming the language at all. I think the quickest fix would have been for MIT to offer either a placement exam or voluntary registration for two classes, one for students who were more-or-less new to programming and one for students with a strong background in something like C++ or Java. Both classes could have used SICP as a text and worked fine.",1384127390

The connotations of the various words in our respective languages are not in our control. &quot;Engineer&quot; and &quot;gardener&quot; have very different connotations. In a profession that sometimes struggles to gain respect, it would not behoove us to use a term that (wrongly in my opinion) is associated with lower social and professional status. If we could rewrite the English language and define &quot;gardener&quot; as a person with rare, hard-to-learn, and highly valuable skills, then perhaps we would do well to embrace the term &quot;software gardener.&quot; But we can&#x27;t.[1]<p>Second, software <i>is</i> engineering. This article seems to define engineering as Big Design Up Front. While that may describe <i>part</i> of what engineering <i>can</i> entail, it&#x27;s not a complete or general description. If I had to describe engineering generally, I&#x27;d say it has to do with understanding and manipulating complex systems, analyzing and fulfilling requirements, distilling vague notions to concrete implementations, and building things that work. Software fits all of that.<p>[1] As I hinted above, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair, right, or accurate to denigrate actual gardeners as compared to software engineers.

There have been quite innovative alt coins in this first wave, the most prominent ones being Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, Freicoin and possibly Anoncoin as they have all found niches that they can cater to. Litecoin has the second largest market cap and has the honour of being the first major Scrypt coin Peercoin has the third largest cap, it introduced Proof of Stake as an alternative for Proof of Work and in the latest round of alt coin investment it did the best in terms of market cap increase to coins ratio. Namecoin has a niche as a alt DNS Primecoin allows Proof of Work to be useful rather than selfish to the network as is the case with Bitcoin Anoncoin recently integrated i2p and Zerocoin to provide greater anonymity for users Freicoin had a great idea with demurrage, very capitalist, but it failed because people want a currency that&#x27;s either going to hold or appreciate in value and also because 80% of the funds were held by the Freicoin foundation rather than the community.<p>There&#x27;s also a second wave of altcoins coming, ones not based on Satoshi&#x27;s algorithms.

6708988,comment,6708414,6708414,2,0,mauricioc,,,"(I only read the very first function from the implementation, so I apologise for the overly-specific comment in advance.)<p>Simple and fast ways of calculating modular inverses are:<p>- Bzout&#x27;s identity. That is, inverting p mod q can be done by adapting the Euclidean GCD algorithm to produce numbers x and y such that xp + yq = gcd(p, q). The adaptation is usually called the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, and it is simple: For the base case of the Euclidean algorithm, where p divides q, we can take x = 1 and y = 0. For the other cases, we can use recursion: if we have x&#x27;, y&#x27; satisfying x&#x27; * p + y&#x27; * (q%p) = gcd(p, q%p) = gcd(p, q), then summing and subtracting y&#x27; * p * (q/p) (integer division here) allows q to reappear in the equation by some rearranging, since q = (q/p) * p + (q%p). This allows us to find x, y in terms of x&#x27;, y&#x27;.<p>Since p is prime in this particular case, gcd(p, q) = 1 for all relevant values of q and thus y is the modular inverse of q: xp + yq = 1 (mod p) implies yq = 1 (mod p). Perhaps it&#x27;s relevant to mention that this method works even for non-prime p, just as long as gcd(p, q) = 1.<p>- Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. That is, the inverse of q (mod p) is q^(p-2) (mod p), since q^(p-2) * q = q^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) by Fermat&#x27;s little theorem. You can compute q^(p-2) (mod p) in logarithmic time by doing binary exponentiation: a^b is 1 if b is zero; it equals (a^(b/2))^2 if b is even, and it equals a * (a^(b/2))^2 if b is odd (integer division again!).",1384126344

There have been quite innovative alt coins in this first wave, the most prominent ones being Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Primecoin, Freicoin and possibly Anoncoin as they have all found niches that they can cater to.
Litecoin has the second largest market cap and has the honour of being the first major Scrypt coin
Peercoin has the third largest cap, it introduced Proof of Stake as an alternative for Proof of Work and in the latest round of alt coin investment it did the best in terms of market cap increase to coins ratio.
Namecoin has a niche as a alt DNS
Primecoin allows Proof of Work to be useful rather than selfish to the network as is the case with Bitcoin
Anoncoin recently integrated i2p and Zerocoin to provide greater anonymity for users
Freicoin had a great idea with demurrage, very capitalist, but it failed because people want a currency that&#x27;s either going to hold or appreciate in value and also because 80% of the funds were held by the Freicoin foundation rather than the community.<p>There&#x27;s also a second wave of altcoins coming, ones not based on Satoshi&#x27;s algorithms.

Can you not write any program using either? Haskell uses just the former, and JS the latter (though without type safety).<p>> Scala unifies the different concepts by expressing them through Java-style classes and inheritance.<p>I think it &quot;unifies&quot; them only in the sense that the (single) compiler can compile all three. But case classes  cannot be part of an inheritance hierarchy nor structural types (or inheritance types) be used as ADTs. The three certainly intersect, but they&#x27;re not really <i>unified</i>.<p>> It is immensely useful to have both dynamic dispatch and ADTs/pattern matching in the toolset; they are often useful for different problems.<p>Obviously, and that is why some languages employ the one or the other. The question is, how useful is it (from a cost/benefit perspective) to have all three (plus macros!) in the same language? After all, while each has its benefits sometimes, they also overlap a lot, as most programs are about as easily implemented in all three. As I&#x27;ve said elsewhere, in language design, as in most things, one must choose. A pizza, a steak and ice-cream all have their place, but may lose much of their flavor if mixed into the same dish. In the JVM ecosystem we are lucky enough to have easy interoperability between languages. The JVM is a restaurant with a varied menu, and you can have a meal of several courses. The best way to go, IMO, is to pick one simple language you&#x27;re comfortable with and use it for most tasks, and for those tasks that require specialized skills outside your chosen language&#x27;s strengths  use another.",1384124931

Just recently I switched companies and needed to set up a new devops environment from scratch, and before starting I evaluated Ansible, Chef and Salt to determine whether they were superior to Puppet. I decided they were not.<p>I am not &quot;in love&quot; with Puppet. People who are in love with technology tend to make decisions for the wrong reasons. I have very little loyalty when it comes to choosing software, and will gladly replace any part of my stack if there is a better solution; but I greatly appreciate maturity and stability. Freshly minted, grandly-hyped technology is by definition immature.<p>I am truly tired of software being unnecessarily reinvented. The &quot;not invented here&quot; (or perhaps &quot;not invented by me&quot;) treadmill where young, inexperienced developers throw away older, mature technology simply because it&#x27;s not fresh and new is something I try to stay away from. Sometimes (Rails, Node.js, Nginx, Go) it brings something genuinely new to the stable, but generally it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Lastly, I don&#x27;t appreciate your condescending tone. And really, I&#x27;m not your friend.",1384124654

There are lots of great outdoor activities like mountain biking, hiking, golf, etc. that you can enjoy at least 10 months out of the year (depending on your tolerance for heat in the summer). You can even ski at Lee Canyon.<p>Although you&#x27;re dismissive of the strip, and I can understand why from the typical visitors&#x27; perspective, there are literally tons of things to do there and many of them are significantly discounted or free to Las Vegas residents. I did the math and over the course of 3 years I went to tens of thousands of dollars of things for free.<p>There are concerts, some of the best restaurants in the world, conventions, boxing, shopping, and more. Traffic is manageable. Cost of living is low. Flights to most places are cheap. You can be in Southern California or doing outdoorsy stuff in Utah for the weekend with a few hours drive, or easy 1 hour flights.",1384124574

But not the quality of it.

>The quality of intelligence is something very hard to quantify. But as simply as I can state it, it&#x27;s the quality of coming up with an idea that is not just an extension of an existing one, but an idea that came seemingly from nowhere. To someone else the idea appears magic, and no amount of thinking by that other person can lead him in a path that will end up there.<p>To be frank, before I&#x27;ll believe this I want to see studies done on either humans or a mathematical examination of formal models of intelligent agents.<p>I think &quot;never&quot; is much too strong a word, considering that we seem to have a huge abundance of people capable of learning calculus even though few can rediscover it from scratch.  There appear to exist very many people who would require such great efforts to learn certain things that doing so would be unpractical, but very few who simply cannot learn things no matter how much effort they put in.",1384124437

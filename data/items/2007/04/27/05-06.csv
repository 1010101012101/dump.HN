There is a product I know of, the Zeus IOPS, which gets extremely fast write speeds to flash.  Unfortunately it costs about $250/GB.  For that price, you can get a RAM based solution, which is even faster.  Ones like <a href=""http://www.hyperossystems.co.uk/"">http://www.hyperossystems.co.uk/</a> can come with a battery backup and a hard drive that it will dump to and restore from if the power goes out.  Price is about $220/GB.  The prices sound high, but if you're trying to scale a database, it can potentially solve an otherwise intractable problem without any software changes.",1177653141

Granted, I'm bombarded with ""you have the rest of your f___ing life to work"" (one of my professors pulled me aside and told me that), and the usual ""you should make college the funnest time of your life!"" (according to the hippy generation of people who probably just miss getting high during their youth and being rebelious)<p>Anyway, I consider what people tell me and then make my own decisions.  I'm slowly disconnecting myself from my friends, and I don't see that as a bad thing.  I see it as a way to focus my concentration entirely on my startups.<p>It depends on how much you value your friends versus how much you value your startup.  You're going to marry one of them, so you'll need to figure that out at some point.<p>Some people say you can do both, but it's like getting married in my opinion.  Once you get married, you can't keep hanging out with all your old friends like you always did.  You're committed to someone (or your startup) from that point on, and unless you really put in the time and work at it, it probably won't work.  I can think of very few things that work by just casually doing it on the side (ie Facebook).  Even in that case, Zuckerberg is an entrepreneurial individual and had a strong interest in programming.<p>This is all coming from a college kid who has never been married, though.  I speak not from experience, but from observation ;)",1177652290

What hasn't been talked about is the environment that this change is making for Apple.  The biggest argument for all business to use MS and PC's has been the standard set by them for file exchange and application availability.  With that standard now moving to the web, it opens the door <i>WIDE</i> for Apple to start taking market share in the PC market, an opening that hasn't been here for them since the Apple II.  (Note: I am typing this note on a Dell laptop, but my next one is looking increasingly like an Apple.  How I dreamed of getting a NEXT when they first came out.)",1177651811

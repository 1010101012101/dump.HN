711606,comment,711587,711587,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Hey Andrey,<p>I think that a large part of the disconnect between the actual law and peoples position (and their perceived ignorance) stems from the fact that the laws are no longer used as they were intended. People tend to live with an understanding that laws are 'reasonable' and that the interpretation of the law will cause some kind of balance in society, in other words a sense of justice.<p>When that all goes out the window the disconnect between how the laws should work and how they really work gets larger and larger until it snaps.<p>We're not there yet, but more and more people are waking up to abuses of copyright law on both sides of the line.<p>Filesharing is a nice example, and DRM abuses are another, as is the buying/bribing of politicians in order to get more favourable laws passed.<p>If the corporate side would be more reasonable about their 'rights' I'm sure that the people would be more reasonable about such things as piracy.<p>The way things are going right now we're heading for an all out confrontation which in the worst case will lead to draconian penalties (some of that has already happened) and as an alternative to that to a total abolishment of copyright (which some would argue is a good thing but I'm not so sure about that).<p>Also, and this is understandable, since HN seems to be reasonably US centric, you have to keep in mind that lots of what you wrote above is applicable to the US alone.<p>Lawrence Lessig is one of the heroes of our modern times, but it still remains to be seen if he's actually going to manage to fight these windmills and their owners.

If you're marketing Nike, you don't get just as much meat regardless of whether people buy Reeboks, Nikes, or Birkenstocks. Your incentive structure is totally different. If you're really good at winning in the incentive structure of a marketing director, Nike's sales will go up, regardless of whether they're better or worse for the customers.<p>It's probably futile trying to argue with you since you started the conversation by, essentially, saying that you don't believe in honest debate.

The problem is that <i>marketing</i>, which is where you try to persuade someone of something because it will benefit you personally, regardless of its truth, is fundamentally corrosive to the kind of disinterested investigation of the truth that we need in order to collectively solve these problems.<p>You could as easily say that these are violence problems: it's just a matter of getting really talented soldiers to kill the people who are opposing the solutions. The trouble is that there's no correlation between the correctness of a person's point of view on how to solve world hunger and their skill at violence, so generally speaking, increasing the level of violence doesn't improve the level of competence in social, economic, and agricultural policy. (I guess it might solve the water shortage problem in a different way, though, sort of like you can lower the rate of heart disease by administering carcinogens.)<p>Similarly, there's no positive correlation between the correctness of one's opinion and one's skill at marketing.

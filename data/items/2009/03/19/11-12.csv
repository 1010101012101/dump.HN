I've been thinking about collecting my thoughts into an essay anyway, might be able to express them better without enraging people.<p>Despite what it might sound like, I actually have no interest in child porn beyond its corrosive effects on society. I would mount a similarly impassioned defence of the legal rights of terrorism suspects or against drug prohibition. I do not particularly condone drug use or terrorism either. I just don't want populist fearmongering and government overreaction to tear even more of society's freedoms and legal foundations apart in pursuit of these phantoms.<p>I'll bow out now before I piss anyone off even more.",1237463111

Fair enough, although I can argue Chrome is both much better solution to this particular problem :)<p>Personally I think scribd solves some problem <i>for publishers</i>, while actually degrading the experience for a significant minority of the <i>viewers</i>. Their relationship with publishers have significant negative externalities, and this makes scribd at least somewhat evil.",1237462891

523159,comment,523078,523140,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""or in other words a vesting schedule, which is how almost all funded startups are structured""<p>FWIW Seth is actually talking about a bootstrapped company and not a venture backed startup. As it stands the software is already complete, and there are maybe ten thousand potential firms who are well-suited to buy licenses. They don't want to grow in any way, so at any given time there are only two things the founders can do that would create value: sell a license, or add a feature / improve UI. Because of this I think some variant of Seth's suggestion actually makes sense in this case, albeit choosing a split upfront and then vesting is normally a much more sensible way to go.",1237462777

If you seriously believe it, if you think that porn leads to rape, why aren't you arguing against banning <i>all</i> porn?<p>Look, I'm not an expert. I'm talking about this topic because I believe in certain general principles of freedom and legal process. I have no special interest in child porn beyond its prohibition's corrosive effects on what I consider to be important aspects of society. I haven't read any studies, nor plan to. I haven't read any studies about violent video games causing violence either, yet I reject any ban on them out of pure principle - same here.<p>Anyway, I think I'll bow out now before some misguided soul calls the cops on me, or worse.

I checked the power settings and <i>minimum</i> processor state was 100%.  I changed it to a more reasonable number and all was good.  But 10-15 minutes later the fan would come back on full blast because that setting has been reverted back to 100%!  Every time I reset it, some time later it go back to 100%.<p>I&#x27;m not one to leave something like that alone and after <i>a lot</i> of searching the internet and applying updates I found that someone else had discovered the cause.

This API should behave the same way regardless of whether data flows through the functions one value at a time (i.e. iterables / generators + yield), in response to emitted events (e.g. Node-style streams), and periodically sampled values (continuous data sources such as audio, electrical signals, UI inputs, even time-independent things like vector graphics, etc...).\n* The necessary primitives to support the above. Functor literals, promises, etc...\n* A better single number type for most use cases\n* The ability to easily define custom binary types, for implementing things like low level binary protocols more easily",1414918733

8546117,comment,8545206,8545883,0,0,dasmithii,,,"First of all, thank you for this in-depth response. It beats the hell out of anonymous and explanation-less downvotes.<p>I had never come across the word neurotypical before your comment and now, after reading the corresponding wikipedia page, I am aware that it does characterize me (i.e. &quot;anyone who does not have autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, bipolar disorder, ADD/ADHD, or other similar conditions&quot;).<p>For the majority of elementary, middle, and secondary school, I fit your anecdote pretty well, minus the getting drunk part (I was young, sheltered, and without access to or interest in alcohol).<p>However, after sophomore year or so, I realized how much time I had wasted pushing through boring, repetitive tasks, and I grew incapable of completing assignments. This turning point left me in the position of ADHD-afflicted individuals for the final two years of high school. Call it burnout, early senioritous, or whatever - the symptoms were the same. With fear of college app rejections as my motivation (like your fear of unemployment), I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do mandatory, largely weighted assignments. They were just too boring, meaningless. Somehow I remained motivated up until then. I really don&#x27;t know how, to be honest.<p>Out of curiosity, how would you say my realization [and subsequent drop-off in academic performance] relate to ADHD and NT?<p>On another note, are A\nDHD-afflicted individuals literally incapable of mustering the &quot;internal whatever&quot; you speak of? Is the ability to conjure motivation entirely absent? It&#x27;s really hard to compare similarly subjective abilities, like pain thresholds and the like.<p>Even if this incapability is just that: a true incapability, I&#x27;m not certain that portrayal of ADHD as an affliction is a net-benefit. It seems better for people to believe in their own capabilities, even when many are literally incapable, as you say. Similarly, the belief in free will is good for people and society - even if free will is obviously nonexistent. Determinism yields higher rates of depression and discourages self-responsibility.",1414918603

8546115,comment,8544079,8544079,0,0,jbert,,,"To me, the interesting thing in terms of building reliable, performant systems is what do you want to do when the request rate (incoming desired throughput) exceeds your possible throughput.<p>Broadly, you have to choose between quickly failing the additional requests, queueing them up yourself (have a fixed number of requests you process at a time) or you just attempt to process them as they come in.<p>- If you don&#x27;t plan for this eventuality you&#x27;ll basically end up doing the latter option.<p>This will overwhelm your processing step, which will then typically cause the latency of <i>all</i> requests you are processing to up. (e.g. because you&#x27;re over your working RAM set, CPU budget etc). Worse, it will go up in unpredictable ways, often with a sharp hockey stick curve.<p>- If you queue up requests, you&#x27;re adding latency to everything right there. Your backend is still cranking away at the same low latency, but your system latency now additionally has the queue dwell time added in. On the plus side, you&#x27;ll avoid unpredictable performance &quot;cliffs&quot; where everything drops down to nothing. On the downside, if your queue gets too long, you&#x27;ll end up in the unhappy state of very quickly processing stale requests which no-one cares about.<p>- Simply failing the additional requests protects your system, but exposes error conditions externally. (Of course, so does having an 10s HTTP request time...)<p>Hybrid approaches can work well. (e.g. running a managed queue but cull the queue (and fail the associated request) before you get into the &quot;queue of death&quot; scenario).<p>Aaaaand....every approach apart from &quot;just try to process it&quot; requires you to have an understanding of your backend capacity.<p>You can to test and measure to find a static number, but an additional problem is that the load caused by real-world requests can differ from your test load.<p>And your backend capacity can be affected by failing components, high load on adjacent components, code deployment, backup, cold cache restart, etc etc.<p>So it&#x27;s best probably to have a queueing/failing strategy which takes into account the real-world health and latency of your backend.<p>Which appears to handle all cases, except that due to the sharp hockey-stick latency in response to overload, by the time you detect a problem it may be too late.<p>Fun.",1414918521

You can switch jobs at will, and even work multiple jobs (with concurrent petitions) at the same time.<p>Furthermore, AC21 enables you to begin working as soon as your next/future employer has filed a petition â€“ so you don&#x27;t have to wait until USCIS makes a decision. With a good employer and attorney, USCIS will generally approve the case (although I&#x27;m sure there are outliers).<p>In practical terms, the effect of AC21 is that (for the most part) it allows you to take up any job in that is directly related to what you major.

(not per year, not every two years etc.)\nI do not understand where the myth comes from that one has to pay every year or continuously to use MS licenses?\nThe math is simple:\nA W2K12 Standard server license costs around 850 USD (~ 700 EUR) - once - even if Opensource would is cheaper in term of license costs, a software running 24/7 for a one-time payment of 700 EUR isn&#x27;t that expensive.<p>Now, it comes down to scale up or scale out:\n- in the one scenario, because of no costs you can scale massivley out, going from one machine to n machines\n- but if you ever tried to administrate your machine park lonely(!!) if it counts 5+ machines (while you have to develop/maintain & run the app itself, too!), some may consider to hire a network admin (which is a fixed salary per year which usually outweighs the costs of your MS Server license)<p>The reason why C# is used, is simple (and was stated above):\n- C# and .NET are very convenient and mature environments to write apps in\n- C# is considered by me as a beautiful language, i really like it (coming from x years of &quot;C-styled-syntax-languages&quot; could make me somehwat biased ;-)<p>Instead of the licensing costs of MS products, i see much more important difficulties in the mid- to long-run future if someone built on it:\nMS maybe not survive the upcoming decade because of huge market shifts; then, in 10 years, it may be a problem if you will not get any support because the company maybe no more existing.\nGod thanks, the next version of ASP MVC has a VM for *nix-derivatives, so you could solve this issue by running your app on a Linux-box.\n(And if you then have built your app additionally on a top of an ORM, you won&#x27;t have any issues)",1414917759

However, the pure text editing experience with vanilla Eclipse/VS is rubbish compared to Vim. In addition, there are languages for which IDE-based code generation/autocompletion is not that interesting due to the language being a lot more compact. And with something like syntastic + the right language plugin, a strongly-typed language gets syntax checking, a description of the type of a variable, and possibly autocompletion. I use both Eclipse (with a Vim plugin) and the real Vim, and it feels much nicer not have to deal with the resource and mental overhead of a full-blown IDE.

Let me say this once: H1B workers are not tied down to a particular employer.\n>\n>It used to be the case that the were, but in 2000, Congress passed a law (known as &quot;AC21&quot;) which brought job portability for H1B workers. I don&#x27;t know why I keep hearing people on HN and elsewhere talk as though AC21 never happened over and over again.<p>If you are fired or laid off there is no grace period to find a new job. So, if you are lucky and you time it right you can transfer to a new employer. If you don&#x27;t, hard luck and get out.<p>So it is false to say that you are not tied to your employer. The tie is there, it is has just weakened since 2000.",1414915441

244197,comment,243609,244154,0,0,time_management,,,"That brings up an interesting question: if immortality were possible, would people choose to die, and what would their motivations be? It seems that curiosity about the afterlife would be a primary factor. Then there is the question: would this curiosity mount over time, to the point that everyone succumbed to it? I don't think anyone can answer this question. Peoples' religious views might change over the centuries-- I know mine have, over mere decades-- and it might be that nearly everyone comes to believe in a better life after death at some point, and chooses to die.",1215824276

I checked on Loopt, and there he was, ""39 mi NW"" in SF. I didn't even have to bother him to find out what he was up to. It's kind of like Twitter, but implicit instead of explicit.

244183,comment,243453,243577,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"| This is totally a commercial idea. They seem to be interested in the clicks and henceforth the dollars. The idea would have been a runaway hit if they tried to personalize news as per personal interests.<p>There was a great magazine article sometime back -- that I can't find now -- that featured a guy who'd been in the radio business for a long time complaining that the ratings and rankings system that he'd developed effectively killed radio, causing so many stations to all play the same homogeneous crap. Yahoo's system, and news in general reflect the same problem: following the money leads to this steaming pile of crap that a lot of people seem to hate.<p>But there's another edge to this too. People who claim to be interested in specific subjects, or in meatier or niche news, are still drawn in to some of the vacuous material. So, nobody actually really wants a completely personalized news service; I'm convinced that that's one reason why jaanix hasn't made it big, while Reddit continues to steam along. People will tune Jaanix for the news feeds that they think they ought to like, and then they quit following it after a while because they'd actually rather click on all of the [pic]s on Reddit's front page.",1215822536

I boostrap my life and would expect to run a startup in much the same way.  Depending on the type of startup, however, VC funding may very well be valuable.  I have advanced Excel modeling skills and I build financial models everyday.  I have experience working with numerous small to mid size companies and closed $10k-$20k web projects with my clients on a consistent basis while I was a junior/senior in college.  I'm obviously not a programmer, but I learned enough to basically run the sales efforts for this company, make us a leader in working with alternative energy clients, and make clients comfortable with sending a $10k check to a small company they had never even heard of before.",1215822484

244178,comment,244122,244162,0,0,pelle,,,"I like that.<p>Using that we could work out a similar formula for project or time based equity.<p>Lets say you agree that a developer gets say %5 (e) for building the first prototype. Assuming developer only gets the project half built he gets half of  e(completion percentage) 2.5%.<p>The difficulty here are the same though as in normal fixed price, namely that of scope change and creep. This is in particularly a problem with startups, where you should be changing scope and direction all the time.<p>A possibly better way could be to work out an time based deal based on how much a founder would get.<p>Lets say programmer A and B are both of equal skill level:<p>A agrees to work fulltime as a founder receives 10% (e) complete with regular vesting over 4 years.<p>B can not for whatever reason offer to work fulltime but would like a similar deal only with hourly vesting. As there isn't a normal 1 year cliff we probably want to reduce e to maybe half of what A is making so lets put e to 5% as a example. This would of course all be for personal negotiation.<p>Lets assume 4 years is equal to 8000 hours. He is vested using a variation of pg's formula e(hours/8000). So if he only ended up doing 100 hours during the life of the project his share would be 0.0625%.<p>Thoughts?",1215822171

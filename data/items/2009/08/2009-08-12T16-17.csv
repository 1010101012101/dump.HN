I'm looking for a two part answer: a) a number, b) what the number is measuring.<p>Let me be intellectually honest with you: there is no basis for assuming that an improvement from 2.0% conversion to 2.6% conversion is not statistically significant.<p>You need sample sizes to even attempt to do the math.  For example, try doing a chi-squared test on 100,000 people converting at 2% versus 5,000 converting at 2.6%.<p>I'm thinking you'll find that you reject the ""just as awful"" hypothesis with over 99% certainty.",1250096269

We're really looking forward to running all of these benchmarks (along with TPC and iiBench), but there is only so much we can do with a limited amount of time.<p>One thing we're finding is that people are skeptical by default. In retrospect, we probably should have expected this given the amount of false advertisement, magic bullets, and vaporware out there. We're not offering magic bullets - we're simply optimizing for modern hardware and modern workloads as opposed to 1970 hardware and database usage patterns. We'll be posting more benchmark results and detailed explanations of how RethinkDB works to win your confidence. We're not trying to trick you. What's the point?

If we had real robots that could be turned loose with nothing more than a layout of the desired network and the necessary resources, and could intelligently deal with most blockages and intelligently call in human help when needed (and <i>only</i> when needed), then the cost equation of this idea changes a <i>lot</i>. (Also, robots to do a lot of basic maintenance without human intervention are probably necessary.)<p>Right now, it's a total pipe dream. Perhaps when we get such robots, it'll be more cost-effective to do something else instead, like an above-ground robotic bucket brigade for item deliveries. Or robotic delivery vehicles. But the tunnel approach may turn out to be feasible. (Or, more likely, a bucket brigade in some places, tunnels in others, and robotic drivers in yet others, where each makes most sense, freely intermixing delivery styles as needed.) So, bear in mind it is not that I am predicting specific results like ""tubes in the ground"", but that robots are going to radically change the cost side of many cost/benefit analyses.",1250094519

758410,comment,757828,758155,0,0,codedivine,,,"I have used it for writing a compiler for a research project. It is a great language so far. Even if you stick to a subset of Scala fairly close to Java, even then its a pretty big win.  There are lots of little goodies. For example, type inference is really nice. For-comprehensions are pretty sweet. Lists are pretty awesome. Optional parenthesis for method calls is nice. And so on and so forth. These little things make Java a lot less annoying.<p>Of course, the little goodies are the tip on the iceberg. There is a lot more to Scala, primarily its support for FP but the learning curve is also much harder for those features. Power at the cost of learning.<p>On the downside, sometimes Scala code is TOO compact. For example, stuff like operators for list operations can be fairly hard to read without practice.<p>Interfacing with existing Java libraries is also easy. I have not tried calling Scala from Java however.<p>Overall I recommend the language. Its mature enough to be used for real projects and its a lot nicer and whole lot more powerful than Java.",1250093419

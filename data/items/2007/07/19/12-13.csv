The guarana is $2.99 an ounce. They're both great flavors. If you make a strong kola or guarana solution, you can use it to flavor rum and cokes and other drinks. A house teaspoon of either is about equal to a cup of a coffee, which makes them a cheaper source of caffeine than any energy or coffee drink.<p>This place lets you get it wholesale if you want to try reselling it, they've also got bulk extracts with guaranteed caffeine levels. federalabs.com/1kilopricing.htm.<p>My preferred stimulant is Kratom.. Sometimes productivity boosts are worth using performance enhancing drugs, caffeine or otherwise. My Kratom site is <a href=""http://www.getkratom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getkratom.com</a> and please email if you have any questions.<p>Then there are other drugs that can make you smarter, or at least measurably increase working memory. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam</a>.

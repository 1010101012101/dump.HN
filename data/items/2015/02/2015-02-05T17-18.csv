9004694,comment,9003439,9003835,0,0,trcollinson,,,"It is very likely that you were named in one of the acquisition documents as a key employee. This can mean that your leaving would, literally, stop the deal. I was in a similar position about 10 years ago. I was a key employee during the acquisition and subsequent merger of a business and I was named as such in the acquisition documents. However, while I was offered a relatively ok position with the new company, many other companies were offering me better opportunities.<p>One thing you must understand about the sale of a business is everything is very quiet because everyone is afraid of being screwed over. The company you work for wants the sale to go through and to have their exit be fruitful after many years of work. The company buying your company would like to get all of the assets, of which you are one, and make the new entity profitable for them in some way. You want to be treated well and see an exit that you believe you deserve, and so on. This is a tough balancing act and unfortunately, not a situation most people treat very honestly. I was there! I know how you feel.<p>What I did was stayed until the documents were signs. I was officially an employee of the new company for one day. The companies were officially (from a legal standpoint) merged. I then went to my new bosses and said &quot;Now that the companies are merged, I need you to make this right for me by giving me X, Y, and Z.&quot; They said, &quot;No way, you have a job, get back to work.&quot; I then packed up my stuff and left to one of my other job offers. I got what I wanted. The company I had worked for got the exit they wanted. The new company wasn&#x27;t very happy but never the less got the merger they paid for.<p>At any rate, your milage may vary. Situations like this suck! But remember deep down this is business. Do what you need to do to make yourself and your family or whatnot comfortable and happy.",1423159168

On high end devices the &#x27;native&#x27; fxos application are incredibly snappy and there has been very little done to improve performance on high end devices.<p>Most of the stuff we have done is common sense, some you will see a lot of people doing, some almost no people do.<p>1. Shorten the path to rendering first screen, dont block on reading some data, load all scripts async etc.<p>2. Never animate top / left, use CSS transitions for everything.<p>3.

9004675,comment,9002713,9003956,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>Though the counterargument is that by creating a deep market into which they can sell their works and rights, creators benefit.</i><p>I suspect that particular counter is readily debunked by looking at the amount of money made by huge middleman industries (publishers, record labels, movie studios, etc.) compared to the original artists (authors, editors, musicians, producers, actors, directors, etc.). In particular, how many artists ultimately receive very low compensation for their efforts relative to the proven actual value of the work they create?<p>Then the marketing/distribution engines have to start justifying their existence based on additional value generated <i>for the original creators of the work</i>. However, it seems likely that any such justification would also support a model where the original creators retain the fundamental rights, and instead only a short-term exclusive licence can be granted to a distributor, who can then renegotiate with the artist to renew their exclusive licence a year or two later (presumably if and only if the distributor still thinks the work is worth promoting and the creators still think they&#x27;re getting a fair deal).<p>You&#x27;d need some sort of collective licensing arrangement so that one make-up artist or background musician who worked on your blockbuster film couldn&#x27;t screw up the whole distribution chain by withholding consent, but again that could probably be addressed by tying any decision-making authority to the original artists with some sort of quorum requirement and some sort of up-front agreement on the distribution of any future returns.",1423159007

In the US, it can take forever to get on disability.  With true basic income, there&#x27;s no need to worry about getting on disability, since you already have a basic income (and yes, this means that disability should be eliminated if this passes).<p>2) It becomes much less expensive to administer.

Replace &quot;bitcoin&quot; with &quot;casino chips&quot;. Is every casino in Vegas behind bars? No. Why not? Because there was no intent to launder, only an intent to exchange value for value.<p>Secondly, the concern over bitcoin dealing being a Money Services Business (MSB) is a little more legitimate. IIRC, FinCEN has already stated that these sorts of businesses are MSBs, and require all the usual compliance measures attached to that label. There are also some states that consider bitcoin trading businesses MSBs as well, on the state level. On a practical level though, hardly anyone is enforcing these rules. Does that mean there&#x27;s no risk? No, of course not; there&#x27;s definitely a risk.

Makes sense, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that it would be a smarter move to skip charging entirely for now, or to use drastically reduced pricing tiers that exist only for the purpose of preventing abuse. The idea of releasing a product like this with less than impressive demos is a bit of a risk. It&#x27;s not going to encourage people to use it if the demos aren&#x27;t compelling, and the demos won&#x27;t be compelling until a lot of people are using it. I&#x27;d err on the side of optimism here, it&#x27;ll probably work out for the best, but it will be interesting to see how this goes and provide a good case study.<p>My other thought is that if IBM can&#x27;t get sufficient training data on their own, what hope do the rest of us have? Performing classification on arbitrary data is a herculean task. People could throw literally <i>anything</i> at this api and will expect to get common sense results, it&#x27;s nearly impossible and pushing the boundaries of what even cutting edge software can do. But if a company like IBM spends billions of dollars and their demos still end up generating mostly confusion and complaints... This kind of open ended &quot;AI&quot; might be more difficult than even the most conservative experts thought.<p>EDIT: As an after thought, the real value here isn&#x27;t so much software as it is pooled training data. Facebook has been able to identify human faces in photos for years, speech-to-text and concept modelling have all been around for a long time. What&#x27;s difficult is getting the labelled data necessary to distinguish between &quot;is this a picture of a person or a picture of a cat?&quot;. Watson is great and it seems like IBM has made an investment in acquiring and collecting the data necessary to do that. But their big play here might be to build a consumer friendly enough product that their users contribute the rest of that data for them over the next several years, building an aggregate data set that is worth as much or more than the software itself. Again, will be interesting to see how it plays out.",1423157140

9004399,comment,9001931,9003883,0,0,xiaq,,,"No this doesn&#x27;t work either, unless you sacrifice the functionality of using variables as commands. Suppose $echo is equal to &quot;echo&quot;, what is the most reasonable thing one would expect `$echo = $ip` to do?<p>Also consider the following snippet:<p><pre><code>    : ${SSH:=ssh}
    $SSH $host1 &#x27;command1&#x27;
    $SSH $host2 &#x27;command2&#x27;
</code></pre>
This has at least two use cases: 1) The user may direct the script use an ssh that is installed somewhere not in PATH by overriding SSH; 2) The user may supply extra flags to ssh by overriding SSH.<p>That is for the traditional shell part, which is still true in elvish (although due to stricter word splitting semantics use case 2 is different in elvish). Also since in elvish closures are first-class values, it&#x27;s very intuitive to just call them directly:<p><pre><code>    var $f = {|$x $who| echo &quot;Hello, &quot;$who&quot;!&quot; }
    $f = world # outputs &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
</code></pre>
From the design perspective, it <i>is</i> possible to let `$echo = $ip` stand for assignment and still retain the ability to use variables as commands. If you give special meaning to &quot;=&quot; <i>when it&#x27;s the second word and alone</i> and introduce a &quot;call&quot; command:<p><pre><code>    var $f = {|$x $who| echo &quot;Hello, &quot;$who&quot;!&quot; }
    call $f = world # outputs &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
    $f = world      # assigns &quot;world&quot; to $f
</code></pre>
But this introduces quite some ugliness to the language, and I decided that just requiring assignments to use &quot;set&quot; is the best solution.<p>A relevant note: Coming up with syntax for a shell language is actually very difficult due to the existence of bare words which greatly limit your inventory of potential operators. For instance one would very likely expect &quot;echo user@example.com&quot; to just echo &quot;user@example.com&quot;, so if you give special semantics to &quot;@&quot; or &quot;.&quot; it causes confusion and inconvenience. The only safe place you <i>can</i> introduce new semantics is the command, and this forces the language to have a prefix structure. If this reminds you of Lisp, you are correct - due to lack of infix operators lisp has very few restrictions on variable names; but the situation in shell languages is the opposite: due to the liberal use of bare words it is very difficult to introduce new infix operators to a shell language.",1423156392

essentially all of current civilization as
neglecting math and regards this situation
as unfortunate.  Mostly I don&#x27;t and for
the following two reasons:<p>(1) Learning Math?<p>Whatever K-12 or four years of college do
in math, it&#x27;s quite possible to learn
quite a lot of math.  So, I see no big
<i>disaster</i> here.<p>That is, if someone wants to learn some
math, they can go for it.  E.g., there is

materials for learning math, the best of
which are just terrific.<p>Further, there is no shortage of really
good math expertise in at least the top
two dozen or so US research universities.
And there are engineering schools with
programs in the <i>mathematical sciences</i>
with optimization, probability, statistics,
numerical analysis, and more.  Some EE
departments are deep into stochastic
processes, signal processing, stochastic
integration, and more.<p>Since I did a lot of such learning, it&#x27;s
doable.<p>(2) Math for the Economy?<p>If some math has some economic value, then
do a start up where the crucial core,
<i>secret sauce</i> of the start up is the
math.  Right:  As the OP makes clear, in
principle and with some examples, and
with more being possible, the founder of
the start up can do the math, and millions
of user/customers can make use of the
results without being aware of the math at
all.<p>Since I&#x27;m trying to do just such a start
up, maybe such is doable.<p>For the role of math, don&#x27;t see any biggie
problems, for national security,
economies, countries, or civilization.<p>There are a lot of really good
mathematicians.  In part what&#x27;s missing
are their $40 million houses, 300 foot
yachts, private Gulfstream jets, two dozen
Ferraris, drop dead gorgeous trophy
<i>spouses</i>, etc.  So, right, there&#x27;s James
Simons.  And Andrew Viterbi.  But, we need
many hundreds more.  I&#x27;m working on it,

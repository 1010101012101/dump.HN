3247626,comment,3247365,3247526,7,0,mchaize,,,"Hi, I work for Adobe as a Flex expert, and here's my point of view. Well, actually I think that first Adobe needed to start with a ""product"" strategy. Flex was the first RIA technology, and it's still the leading RIA technology of the market. Adobe had to innovate, experimenting new features every year and getting the community excited. That's what generates adoption. Now that the Flex SDK is very mature, it can answer almost all Enterprise needs. It's time to let the community and the customers drive the decisions with Adobe about the future of Flex. Flex masters want to actively contribute to the framework for years. Now there is an opportunity to install Flex as a standard Enteprise RIA stack. Adobe is not only proposing Flex to Apache, Adobe is also proposing BlazeDS, Falcon, FalconJS, and will share all the work already done on Flex 5 components.

And it will leave you with the reputation of ""that guy who pays stupid amounts of money"" rather than ""that guy who hires the best"".<p>Secondly it gives you the expectation of ""I am paying them loads more, so they should have more devotion to the project"". In reality this doesn't always work out - better to get them enthused in the project and offer rewards in the context of the success of the project (this is why big companies don't pay higher and higher rates to get the best talent - but instead use bonuses and other incentives).<p>Thirdly it gets the business into the culture of overpaying; I've seen several companies do this, and at some point in the future you <i>will</i> run into the point where it is not possible to keep paying that rate. Reducing a super-high salary to baseline is de-motivating - you'll get employees just losing engagement and thinking ""hey, I could just get a 'normal' job"". Empirically; I've seen a number of companies fail purely through this factor.<p><i>I want top paid people, comprehensive benefits, complete healthcare, and serious investments in quality training.</i><p>This, however, is a good way to approach it.

3247564,comment,3246259,3247407,6,0,kahawe,,,"You are right, it is not in that post alone but reading through the comments, some of his replies and (especially) some of his others posts linked in here just all added up to this personal impression. I don't know the guy and from what I read I do not want to know him but that's just my personal gut feeling. I don't like those hyperactive, over-psyched, narcissistic, ADHD over-over-achiever types, I find them repulsive. I cannot help it.<p>In my own experience the people you can actually learn something valuable from are the more quiet ones, especially the ones who have actually achieved something. They can share something much more valuable than mere thoughts and ideas on strategy - they can share experience because they have done it. There is a saying that all strategies and battle plans hold up well until first enemy contact. I can relate to this - so in this understanding, if he had done and achieved something worthy of that ""1%"" mantra with his ideas and theories then it would be extremely interesting and valuable to read about it.<p>All I see now on his blog are personal thoughts, meandering, theoretical ideas and a TON of self-applauding and getting psyched on success which is all fine for a personal blog and probably has great therapeutic value for him but in a lot of those posts he does take the position of teaching, educating or even preaching. And he does not just present it as ""hey I have an idea"" and then follows up with ""and that's how it worked in the end"". He just presents ideas and how awesome they are and how right he is. And then it takes but 2 minutes to find an incredible amount of contradictions - he is contradicting himself and his own ideas, guidelines and mantras from one post to the next.<p>These two facts plus the personal impression and gut feeling together are more than enough for me to seriously question his legitimacy. He doesn't feel very authentic, honest and driven by ""positive energy""... he feels very driven, fragmented and unfocused, however.<p>And the question for references or actual success is not only for me, as you pointed out it doesn't make that much sense. It is actually a question directed at him and I honestly think he should apply some critical thought, take a step back and look at what he is doing and saying. Asking him to compare his words, writings and theories to actual outcome and hard facts should provide one way of taking a shot at that. And regarding this specific post, it is very clear to me he deserve all the flak because he seriously needs to reflect on his attitude and how he deals with projects and sharing responsibilities.<p>But I doubt he will take that step back and honestly reflect and instead go all nuts about how the 99% of lazy people are just trying to hold him back.<p>Maybe it is just me, I generally don't feel too crazy about the whole ""blogosphere"" so drenched and drowning in exactly this sensationalist lower-than-mediocrity and low-value noise-floor postings, so maybe I am biased.<p>To give you the other extreme: I cannot help but shake my head at (a lot of) things that PG has written and while I might disagree with the ideas, I can see and understand that they have obviously provided him with at least the right state of mind (paired with lots of luck) to accomplish something. And he can and does share experiences and lessons learned, not just personal theories and road maps like 1. Collect underpants. 2. ... 3. success!",1321536875

I just had a fun trip down memory lane to the days when the Mac had 128k of RAM, 400k floppies, and one floppy drive. Copying a floppy involved at least 5 or 6 disk swaps. Moreover, and relevant to this conversation, you could eject a Mac disk without unmounting it. That was because the system software lived on the boot disk, which you had to remove to load up your documents from your personal disk, but if the Mac needed to refer to a file on a currently-not-present disk it would prompt you for the disk by name, and so it was important to leave a ghostly icon of the ejected-but-not-unmounted disk on the desktop to remind users that the Mac hadn't forgotten about that disk and was liable to request it at any time, so for god's sake don't let someone take it out of the building...",1321536709

One of the thoughts I had, especially reading the stuff you mention about purchasing resources and AWS, is that what the project seems to lack is good <i>administration</i>.<p>One thing I have learned about projects is having a really really good admin person can make them fly. But you seem to have been managing the money and the decisions.<p>So to be harsh (but only as harsh as you've been :)) it appears <i>you</i> are a fucking Joker too.<p>The solution to people clearing stuff with you isn't to tell them not to clear stuff with you - long term that has no practical benefit, and isn't in keeping with human nature. Solving the money issue is not entirely solved by giving them a credit card.<p>The solution is to find a really solid admin person to fix these issues; employ someone who's job it is to address all the nitpicks and the money.<p>One other thing you probably need to learn; there is a distinct difference between the honest truth and simply being abusive. You're calling them fucking Jokers, and telling them you're not. Ok so there is ""nice"" stuff wrapped up in there too - but regardless of whether they are employees or partners this is just de-motivating behaviour.<p>Possibly even deflection.<p>If you're going to tear them a new one; do it right. Or if you're trying to motivate them; do it right. This was a wierd mix of the two :)<p>I don't know much about you. I don't know much about the context.So I don't want to jump up and down and make too much criticism (or accusation). But from what I have observed let me offer some advice; when you have a multi-million dollar company with hundreds or thousands of employees then this is the sort of email you can send, where it indicts no one specifically as a Joker, and be lauded for it. I feel like that is what you modelled on :) Till that point - small teams need intense supportive leadership.

Granted, at least it's better advice to study the things great people study, rather than study great people themselves.<p>By obsessing over what successful people do, we forget to study what the vast majority of people who did not become great did. For the six lessons listed, you can trivially find businesses who did that and failed. I sure you can find businesses for whom that is straight forward bad advice. And finally, you can find businesses who did not do it, and who still succeeded.<p>Those six things was probably the right thing to do for Amazon, at the time Amazon did them.

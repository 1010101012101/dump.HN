688729,comment,687062,688336,0,0,johnwatson11218,,," Actually I remember a  few years ago reading an article that said that the Federal Reserve was studying the feasibility of embedding RFID tags into paper currency. Doing so would allow the banks to know how long a particular note had been out of the banking system and stuffed in a mattress. 
   Then a penalty could be assessed when the note was redeposited. The article said that such a system could allow banks to pay negative interest rates but still be less of a penalty than the penalty for hording cash. As I recall the article said that a $100 bill would be worth about $10 less every month that it was kept out of the banking system – just as an example of how it could work.<p>This is a different article that talks about the same idea in Japan <a href=""http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article6531299.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/art...</a>",1246827341

Perseverance/hard work is a much better predictor of success than raw intelligence. Immigrants, for a couple of generations at least, have the work ethic. Based on other posts to this discussion, this fizzles our by the fourth generation, so you're stuck on a tread mill of bringing in new hard workers to fuel the engine. Is that really the only way to handle this? It doesn't seem to address the root cause.<p>As far as the requirement to post a job to prove no American worker could fill the role, I think it's common knowledge that this aspect of the system is heavily (and easily) gamed.<p>The H1-B program does need to be reworked. It seems like the H1-B visa should provide more freedom to the individual to innovate--start their own company and not be so beholden to their sponsor. I am making an assumption that the hard working, hungry H1-B holder is more likely to start their own company. This is where innovation creation thrives and, therefore, where there is great potential value in H1-B visa reform.",1246826320

By automating jobs away, there are more people capable of doing things that we can't automate yet, and more money available to pay them. Example: a store installs the automated checkout stands and reduces the number of cashiers from 4 to 1. Assuming the automated stands cost $0 to maintain (not true, but the cost I believe is trending that way) then the store can have those 3 displaced employees work the store helping customers find what they need.

You take the book, get the work you done you need to do, and return it right there.  There should be a waiting list as well, so you can time your workload appropriately.  With a little advanced planning, you should be able to work the system.",1246824231

And if they lied to you, that's fraud, and you can press charges against them.<p>If they don't lie, but they don't tell you good things about their platform (you'll have to judge the amount of 'spin' on your own)...then move on. It's really that simple.<p>From your example, you could contact Facebook and ask for some stats about their application platform (telling them that your company is thinking about building an app for that platform). If they refuse to give you stats, either ask to be transferred to a 'higher-up', or tell them you're sorry you couldn't work together and get off the phone. If they do give you stats, you need to judge for yourself if building your app will be profitable on that platform.<p>There is absolutely no company (or person) in the world that is going to be able to quote you a hard number on the amount of profit your app is going to make before it exists.",1246824053

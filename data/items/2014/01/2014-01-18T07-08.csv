You&#x27;re correct to observe that the real fault lies with the political system that encourages the use of bargaining chips, but the people blaming Obama were the only ones saying otherwise.<p>I used CHIP as an example of congress opposing a mandate in order to win concessions. The CHIP issue almost certainly had roughly similar party lines, but given a few hours I&#x27;m sure I could dig up 10 examples of party X opposing party Y&#x27;s mandate to extract concessions regardless of whether X==Y or X!=Y, if that would make you happy.",1390031856

Finger trees[0] are extremely useful and general data structure that can be used to implement persistent sequences, priority queues, search trees and priority search queues. (Haskell&#x27;s Data.Sequence[1] uses specialized 2-3 finger trees internally) They can form the basis of all sorts of interesting custom structures by supplying the appropriate monoid[3], but this does make them harder to approach if you are not familiar with the abstractions.<p>[3] A monoid is any structure that has members that can combine associatively. In addition, it must have an element that can combine with any other element and result in the other element. Some examples: (strings, string concatenation, the empty string); (integers, addition, 0); (natural numbers, max, 0); (booleans, and, True); (functions, composition, the identity function).

Regarding willpower: What I find very useful to remember is that willpower is something we all can and have to develop. Also, it&#x27;s important to understand that willpower is a limited resource. Similar to training your body it has a lot to do with energy management - strain and rest. One of the richest advices I&#x27;ve found is [1]. I particularly like the 4 steps of development:<p>1.

The complexities of modern software call for parts that function together as an integrated whole and are designed to work with each other -- not parts that fulfill one limited task and abdicate all further responsibility. It&#x27;s time to let go of the 1970s conception of the Unix way if we want to build Linux into a modern system.<p>In fact both the dominant desktop Unix -- Mac OS X -- and the dominant proprietary server Unix -- Solaris -- employ an advanced init system similar in many respects to systemd. So there is already established precedent in the Unix realm for what Lennart is doing for Linux with systemd.<p>And again, there is overwhelming support for it in the Linux community, so much so that support for non-systemd configurations is already drying up in a variety of third-party upstreams.

Of course, the latter serves political interests quite nicely and in a manner that helps keep the coffers overflowing.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t treat some matters as black or white (I do because of my own biases--and when I do, I think I&#x27;m right :) ) but it bugs me more than it probably should whenever I see this notion repeated that anyone who shares my political persuasions must, by virtue of our &quot;patriotism,&quot; secretly desire a police state. It seems to me that the police state and the true patriot ought to be at odds with each other. Perhaps my understanding is skewed, but I can&#x27;t think of a patriot who would wish for fewer freedoms, excluding for a moment Orwellian-esque double-speak like the PATRIOT Act...<p>The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily any one political group as much as it is to do with <i>politicians</i>. The majority of which have been so insulated inside the echo chamber that is Washington DC and so far detached from their constituency for so long that it seems they (and any agency you can imagine that they interact with) feel separate from--and probably above--oversight.<p>If I were in a real conspiratorial mood, I might suggest that the divisive nature of US politics is entirely intentional and serves to keep us apart so that we may not work together to toss the bums in power out onto the street.<p>Sadly, though, I think I&#x27;ve already said enough to invite trollish remarks so I ought to stop while I&#x27;m ahead. ;)",1390031212

There are plenty of places where the government infringes on individual rights while pursuing legitimate government ends using otherwise reasonable powers.  Restricting the ends and powers is not enough, unless you beg the question by defining the powers to not infringe on individual rights.<p>I&#x27;m well aware of the difference between positive and negative rights, and that distinction does nothing here (nor is it so easy to define, in practice).

8779534,comment,8777375,8779207,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"<i>IIRC, there was so much cash to move, that the cartel made custom-sized, reusable tote boxes, that fit precisely through the teller windows. To not notice that, when you have continuous video of all teller windows?</i><p>When you only hear one side of the story (the US Government&#x27;s side) it&#x27;s easy to make a case that sounds damning.<p>Firstly, it&#x27;s not like people were turning up at banks with boxes helpfully labelled &quot;DRUG MONEY&quot;. The point of money laundering is you have a reasonable explanation for where the cash is coming from. In this case the <i>alledged</i> cartel money was actually from companies that processed remittances. It&#x27;s not entirely surprising if such companies move large amounts of cash. And having such boxes (probably provided by the bank themselves) would make a lot of sense for any bank with cash heavy clients.<p>But moreover the US never managed to prove the money actually did come from cartels. Their case amounted to: there&#x27;s lots of cash moving from Mexico to the USA via HSBC. It must obviously contain drug money. Therefore HSBC is guilty.<p>There was also a sideshow related to transactions with Iran, caused by the fact that the USA was trying to impose sanctions on Iran globally but many of HSBCs international clients are not (theoretically) under US jurisdiction. Congress took a very strong &quot;you&#x27;re either with us or against us&quot; line on this and banks (many of them, not just HSBC) got caught in the crossfire.<p>The fact is that AML laws are so terrible every bank is guilty of violating them. You really cannot run a large bank without having some criminal clients and post PATRIOT Act, that&#x27;s enough.",1419162960

8779529,comment,8778253,8779457,0,0,solistice,,,"If the idea of school is to teach students to learn, why aren&#x27;t there courses on learning itself and the framework of things around the act of learning that enables students to efficiently do so?<p>Essentially, why aren&#x27;t good study skills explicitly taught and practiced?<p>What I&#x27;ve experienced through school is that whilst there is some implicit teaching of such skills, a lot of study skills are either found by students themselves through experimentation(random), or passed down from their parents. More often than not, these are attrocious for students that did not have enough parental involvement OR parents that don&#x27;t know how to study efficiently either. My personal hypothesis is that these are affected by and also affect socioeconomic standing. Just like wealth, education also perpetuates through generations.<p>Personally, through highschool my aproach to studying involved cramming, keeping almost no note of due-dates and very messy planning of long term academic projects. In fact, anything that took more than 2 weeks of foresight would leave me scrambling to finish at last minute.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that this did not occur to me to be a problem until well into 10th to 11th grade, which put a dent into my college prospects to say in the least.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve been working on aquiring these skills on my own, playing around with things like holistic learning, spaced repetition, learning how to structure projects and aquiring organizational tools such as org-mode or even something as simple as using a calendar habitually. And it helps immensely.<p>And whilst now I&#x27;m starting to put these things into place, I keep asking myself: &quot;Why was this not pointed out to me back in ,say, 6th grade?&quot;. General education is a great social equalizer, but the assumption that these neccesairy skills are simply passed down seems to go against that very idea. My personal opinion is that teaching these skills would have an incredible impact, since often intelligence is not the problem, but methodology is.",1419162590

In fact, every read from a ZFS filesystem does a complete integrity check of everything that read depends on. If it finds an error during that process it fixes it before returning data to the caller, or returns a read error if it cannot. Those errors get collected and logged, so that if they do occur (usually due to faulty hardware) you can recover the effected files from backup.<p>This is much better than a surprise fsck when you&#x27;re running late.",1419162553

It is a system that used to be commonly employed by private tutors teaching the children of aristocrats and by master craftsmen training apprentices. When done well, it is <i>extremely</i> efficient, because at each step in the learning process what you teach is 1) the most important thing that 2) the student is fully ready to learn.<p>&quot;Fully ready&quot; does not use 100% as its benchmark, though, because that would make the process less efficient. You just need to be good enough that you are well-prepared to learn the next step. You achieve, let&#x27;s say, Level 45 (picturing your learning of a skill as climbing a ladder), which means you&#x27;re ready to move on to Level 46. Level 46 assumes you can use all the skills learned up through Level 45, so it makes use of them, with the result that your Level 45 skill continues to improve with use as you learn Level 46. When you move on to 47, your use of 46 and 45 will continue to improve those skills.<p>So &quot;mastery&quot; of Level 45 does not mean 100% before moving on to Level 46 but means a level of competence that can be <i>used</i> successfully.

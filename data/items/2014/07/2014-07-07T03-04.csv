JSON does not strike me as a great format for a document of this nature, although it&#x27;s certainly <i>possible</i>.  Offhand, I&#x27;d think XML is a more natural fit for this.<p>Anyway, more to the point, there has been some existing work done on developing standards for representing resumes.  I would <i>highly</i>, <i>highly</i> encourage you guys to look at this and consider making whatever you do compatible with the existing work as much as possible.  Consider ResumeRDF[1] for example.

For people middle-class and above, myself included, I get the sense that cars are something that was always present in abundance, and therefore no big deal. We&#x27;re more sensitive to noticing the annoying things about them, like parking, worrying about driving drunk, traffic jams, etc, and perhaps take for granted the freedom in having your own car.<p>People in lower classes, at least that I have interacted with, tend to see a car as more of a status symbol, since they&#x27;re not so readily available at their income levels. As in, their family may have one, but they don&#x27;t just automatically get their kids a car when they turn 16. And so they&#x27;re more of a status symbol, and people tend to more glamorize the freedom of it while ignoring the headaches as trivial.",1404705442

That is why he downloaded the journals - to continue his research into analyzing large datasets to find connections that indicate corruption.<p>There can be no doubt that many people were unhappy about the corruption in the legal industry which he uncovered using his analysis methods. He was continuing that research on a broader scale, which he plainly indicates in his response to Ars Technica and is substantiated by his biographical, research and publication history.<p>As a Harvard Fellow, and as a MIT visitor, and as the son of a MIT employee visiting, he has the right to access those articles, and MIT paid for that access to JSTOR, which JSTOR had no legitimate right to withhold from a credentialed researcher with valid access. He only had to circumvent anything because JSTOR implemented access countermeasures which were contrary to their access agreement with MIT. His circumvention was only for the purpose of obtaining the access he was legally entitled to, and thus was valid.<p>The arguments that he was planning to redistribute articles are without merit and are nothing more than propaganda spread by the criminals at the Justice Department who targeted him for destruction.

That takes time.\nIf working day is too short, then most of the time is spend on such loading and there is not enough time to actually accomplish something.<p>2) Shorter working hours usually means less expertise long term. Less expertise means less productivity.<p>3) Shorter work time means it&#x27;s harder to meet with coworkers, because there is not enough work hours to meet.\nLess meetings with coworkers means lower productivity, because work in isolation usually mean working on wrong problems and less knowledge exchange.<p>So, on one side we have burnout risks. On another size we have incompetence risks.<p>Our society tried various working schedule and worked out 40 hours work week as the one that is closest to the optimum.<p>Note though, that 40 hours work week does not mean 40 hours per week coding.

You can only arrive at that number by ignoring the way the federal sentencing system works, because it&#x27;s based on taking the <i>maximum</i> penalty for any count of the offense charged and multiplying it by the total number of <i>every count</i>.<p>In reality, like charges group --- you are typically sentenced based on a single count, usually the most severe of the counts.<p>Prosecutors threatened Swartz not with 35 years but with 7. But 7 years is an equally ludicrous number for the actual offenses charged, which were non-remunerative, non-destructive, and applied to a first-time defendant. Which may be why prosecutors offered Swartz a plea deal with a custodial sentence just several months long.<p>Swartz&#x27;s own lawyer, writing after Swartz&#x27;s tragic death, believed that Swartz could have gone to trial, lost and been found guilty, and <i>still</i> not served a custodial sentence. Not implausible for a first-time offender who didn&#x27;t try to make a cent from his offense.<p>Reporters parrot these numbers because the DOJ supplies them in press releases. DOJ is lying when it makes these outlandish claims, but deception on the part of prosecutors isn&#x27;t an excuse for reporters not to talk to lawyers before amplifying those lies in the press.<p>As usual, you can count on Popehat --- a blog run by a former federal prosecutor turned civil rights attorney --- for a pretty excellent summary of how the system <i>actually</i> works:<p><a href=""http://www.popehat.com/2013/02/05/crime-whale-sushi-sentence-eleventy-million-years/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popehat.com/2013/02/05/crime-whale-sushi-sentence...</a><p>(If you&#x27;re interested, here&#x27;s the sentencing guidelines for 18 USC 1030: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=nZu3w1y4fkYC&pg=PA299&lpg=PA299&dq=guideline+2Q2.1&source=bl&ots=VCrUGGT_Dr&sig=xdBB4bzMj2BkS9S8_I5oLgCAgtM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FZ0RUeHPGoLFigKi0YGYAw&sqi=2&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=computer%202b1.1&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=nZu3w1y4fkYC&pg=PA299&lpg=P...</a>)",1404702127

7996805,comment,7995728,7995728,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It is the loss of the sense of wonder. The trick is that computers today are really really really fast versions of computers from 60 years ago. Fundamentally the same box, just faster and with more memory and disk space.<p>That isn&#x27;t <i>entirely</i> true of course, there are special function architectures like GPUs which have a specialness all their own, but it is true for most people.<p>But the thing that drives people in the beginning, is the sense of wonder. Same thing with relationships, when they are new, everything about them is new and exciting, and then they aren&#x27;t that much new any more and you don&#x27;t get any relationship augmentation from the newness. So once you&#x27;ve discovered computers, and made them do your bidding, that is all new and all exciting and the feedback loop is strong. But once you have done all of the &#x27;usual&#x27; things once, and due to work obligations are doing them again, but in a slightly different way, you aren&#x27;t getting the adrenalin rush from the newness. Computer games, same thing, movie franchises, same thing. So what to do.<p>Well when the rush of newness runs out, you have three choices; pick a new field, pick a different area in the field, or take it to the next level. New field or different area choices give you a new thing to be excited about, taking it to the next level requires that you challenge yourself.<p>Taking an example from the article, <i>&quot;... I don’t feel like I really grok the module system. I definitely don’t understand the class system. What the hell is a generator and how does it work the way it does? I am so lost.&quot;</i><p>Decide to take your understanding of Python to the next level, and by that seek out the more advanced texts, read them, read the source code, build Python from scratch, add some change to the module system, analyze the impacts, look at how classes work in Python and compare them to classes in C++, Scala, Java, and Go. If you can get over that hump then you can get engaged in learning things at a deeper level. I really didn&#x27;t understand Python modules at all well at Google until I took apart the SWIG system to write some C code that was accessible by Python. Port it to a different architecture, benchmark it, change it and benchmark the changes. That is what I mean by &quot;going deep.&quot; You will find after a while that there is a lot of similarity at that next level too.<p>Another skill people don&#x27;t work on until later than they should, reading code. Read a bunch of code, figure out how it works, prove your understanding by changing it.<p>All of these things are the programmatic equivalent of strength training at a professional level. If you can&#x27;t get any satisfaction from this though, option 1 (try something new) will give you more satisfaction long term.",1404702070

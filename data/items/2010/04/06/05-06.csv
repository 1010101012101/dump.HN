1243990,comment,1243658,1243915,0,0,foldr,,,"> I don't know anything about war, but even I know that it's utterly naive to expect that soldiers wouldn't get off on killing people. It is completely to be expected.<p>How far are you willing to take this argument? Statistically speaking, it's to be expected that invading armies will rape  a substantial portion of the female population. Would it therefore be ""prissy"" to be outraged if this happens?<p>>This is part of the don't-ask-don't-tell contract (the real one) that society has with the military: here are the conditions under which you can be a serial killer; we will call you a hero for it; just don't tell us about it.<p>I think it's still ok to be disturbed by that. It may be true that this incident is just one example of the generally terrible nature of war. But that doesn't make it any less terrible, or make people's reactions to it illegitimate.<p>I hope that this sort of reaction becomes more and more common, so that we eventually figure out that war is, you know, a bad thing.",1270533563

It would actually be a very clever game-theoretic strategy to constrain the memory at first.<p>If Apple had instead released this first iPad <i>without</i> multitasking but <i>with</i> 2GB of RAM (or even more; it could certainly all fit in the case, and RAM doesn't really impact battery life) developers would be sloppy and use as much of it as they wanted, disallowing their apps from ever being multitasked in the future.<p>However, constraining memory to 256MB at first forces developers to write apps that only use that much. Later, Apple can release the 2GB model, and it would suddenly be possible to multitask 8 or more of the 256MB-model apps at once.

I don't know anything about war, but even I know that it's utterly naive to expect that soldiers wouldn't get off on killing people. It is completely to be expected. The fantasy that war would somehow be more acceptable or even possible without it is not serious; it's a head-in-the-sand refusal to consider the ugliness of the thing. Next up: they aren't faithful to their wives while on tour, either.<p>Edit: this comment comes across a little more harshly than I intended. The reason isn't you; it's that I just finished watching the Wikileaks founder in an interview, and his self-righteousness in making the same point really turned me off. The guy could barely contain his glee. I think this kind of outrage is all about stroking one's own moral delicacies. Expecting anything at all about killing people to be decent is foolish.<p>Mainly I'm angry at him for ruining my faith in Wikileaks and turning my world into one in which now no one plays that vital role.

There's no either/or choice there. Consistently, a place producing a lot equates with a high quality of life. The only places that do better for quality of life are relatively small, extremely homogeneous societies (Okinawa, Switzerland, etc). As a general, large scale strategy, produce more is pretty good. Attempts to produce less and streamline it to where the governor thinks it should go have all ended poorly thus far.<p>> Sure, but the incremental benefits of these items to people tends to get smaller. These could be sacrificed at least until everyone reaches a flatter part of this curve. This like medicines, sanitation, are not exactly in the same class as, say, an iPod.<p>Definitely - and this is a choice we already get to make as individuals. You can choose how much you want to consume, invest, and give charitably. It's an individual ethical judgment, and one we must all make and live with.<p>> In practice a decent plan, and perhaps even the only practical one given human nature and our political systems. But still not a goal in itself.<p>Well, I think ""produce as much good stuff as we can"" is a good goal in itself, but improving the baseline of the whole world is good too. Actually, I think they're complimentary goals, and not really in opposition with each other at all. Working to build as much good stuff as possible in the world makes it easier to make more good stuff cheaper - I don't think there's any natural antagonism or choice between producing more and improving the baseline for the rest of the world. In fact, I'm pretty sure they're complimentary goals.",1270530602

To the rest of the world, what the US does/did in Iraq and Afghanistan does look like occupation.<p>Yes, and perhaps that's why we disagree. Conquest and occupation in my mind are not the same. We are certainly occupying Iraq. 'Conquest' in my mind usually only involves simply seizing a country, which we don't seem to have done; easy examples would be Japan's attacks on China and Germany's sweep of Poland in WWII (and in Japan's case, somewhat before WWII as well), or Genghis Khan, or the Romans.<p>Looking up the word, it seems it means much closer to simply 'winning', but I usually use it in the sense of invading, taking and controlling. The US has largely avoided the 'taking' part, at least that I'm aware of, so it doesn't seem like conquest in my head. We are also occupying, but certainly not starting farms and such, actually <i>moving in</i> to live there. I may be way off in some of this, but that's how I saw it. I won't attempt to refute your points; they are mostly good, and through your lens they make sense.<p>> the US is way in over its head wrt the *post invasion"" bit of the operation.

Unfortunately nobody else can enter that market, even if they independently come up with the technology, because there are patents on the multi-touch technology.<p>> Using somebody else's technology is not innovating, it's copying.<p>So using a software library or hardware component as a tool to create innovative technology is not innovating? Technology is a tool that is built upon previously developed technology. Being restricted in this way is a hinderance, not a boon.<p>An example of the potential benefits is in open source software. Open source software has dramatically increased the innovation in the software field.<p>> It also has nothing to do with ""smaller companies"": Fingerworks was a very small company and somehow, in spite of your claims, they were able to innovate.<p>True they were able to innovate. Kudos. I disagree that they needed patents to innovate, as you have previously stated. It's not like their keyboards came with a clone technology button. Cloning takes effort and time and expertise. It is not the characteristic of a market leader, like Apple.<p>Think about it this way, why does any technology (specifically software) company get acquired by a larger company? Is it the technology or the expertise of the staff that is most important? Usually it's the staff, otherwise, why would it be so important for the staff to stay onboard with the acquiring company?<p>> And Fingerworks wouldn't have had any leverage against them except their potential value as employees.<p>Not true. If they wern't bought out by Apple, they would have been a licensor of the technology. They probably would have had a healthy business supplying Apple with iphone/ipad multi-touch technology and making keyboards.<p>However, that deal was significant for Apple because they get significant leverage because they had a shot at a monopoly over the multi-touch technology. Fortunately, this did not happen, but unfortunately there is a bunch of patent litigation waste.<p>> It also has nothing to do with ""smaller companies""<p>It has everything to do with smaller companies. Who can afford the large patent warchests? Larger companies. I suppose patent trolls can count as a smaller company, though.<p>> When products do not differentiate (i.e. when they clone each other), innovation stagnates.<p>The same can be said about a monopoly. There is no differentiation because there is only one party.<p>However, that is all moot because electronics and software is hardly in danger of being stagnant. These areas are innovating ever more rapidly (and NOT because of patents).<p>> Why differentiate when you can just do what your competitors do, but cheaper?<p>Steve Jobs has a good answer for you, and it is not patents.<p>> Why innovate when you can just tack on some blue LEDs and silver trim to differentiate?<p>Because that is not differentiation. People see right through that.<p>> Software is also covered by copyright, which you seem to have ignored entirely, even though it serves effectively the same function of preventing creations from being ripped off.<p>First of all a Patent != a Copyright. Patents are far more broad. They prevent people from independently coming up with an innovative technology, especially if a previous patent is overly broad.<p>Copyrights do not. Copyrights prohibit outright copying, which I am against.<p>I wanted to keep the scope of this discussion on patents because the patent system is obviously very flawed. I also question the utility of patents in the first place. I do agree with copyrights, though.<p>> Why would they if any invention they create is immediately available to their competitors? Doesn't that reward the strategy of simply waiting for others to invent and cloning them?<p>No because nobody invented the magic cloning button yet.<p>> when the established players can simply rip those ideas off?<p>What's wrong with using other people's ideas? Isn't that why humanity is so advanced?<p>> Doesn't it eliminate one of the main reasons that a big company would ever acquire a smaller company?<p>No, because like I said before, bigger companies acquire for talent and licensing.

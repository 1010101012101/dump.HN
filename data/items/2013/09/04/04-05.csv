I read the tutorials, then proceeded to make my own version in Java that works similarly (also typesafe). It&#x27;s easy to make it work, but it always retains the same disadvantage : runtime evaluation.<p>Runtime evaluation means that your program figures out the structure of the grammar into it&#x27;s internal &quot;recursive&quot; state machine every time (in some cases every time you evaluate a string). This means that your parser is effectively running on a very slow, very ad-hoc virtual machine inside your program. In the case of ANTLR (or yacc) the program itself has the required structure. Result, yacc parses happen at close to memory transfer rate (depends on the grammar and the semantic actions obviously), whereas parsec parses, well, you&#x27;re lucky to get 10 MiB/s (similar grammar happened at > 1 GiB/s in java with ANTLR).<p>The difference is large enough that it quickly becomes very hard to ignore. Plus, I like the fact that the ANTLR syntax is more concise, which makes it easier to keep the whole parser in your head once you&#x27;re used to the language. Furthermore there&#x27;s the testing application that comes with ANTLR, ANTLR studio.",1378270762

There should at least be an option for enabling that.<p>2. Hangouts, it just sucks. Does not work reliably on a data connection, messages are received late. Can&#x27;t discover online contacts on the UI easily. Makes it easier to chat but harder to find people to chat.

To effectively grow or run a business, fluency in risk and payoff distributions of your decisions is important.<p>Taking the time to up your education a bit decreases the downside risk of failure, forces you to learn a wider range of material than you (realistically) will teach yourself, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that brain cognitive development doesn&#x27;t really end till 22-24 age range in most people. These all improve the payoff distribution of any decisions subsequently made.<p>As someone working on/in entrepreneurial tech myself:<p>1) the vast majority of interesting engineering challenges are within larger organizations (and thats awesome)<p>2) Nothing is worth sacrificing your health, nothing. Your health is the best predictor of how productive you can be intellectually.

6325502,comment,6324094,6324094,2,0,caw,,,"My first internship offered a 401k with company match. The trick for that is to put in exactly as much to get the company &quot;free&quot; money. If they match 100% up to the first 3% of your salary, you just got a 3% raise so long as you agree to put your money in a 401k. If you ever leave, then you&#x27;ll just roll the account over. Not all of that money could be yours (read the vesting rules), but a good chunk of it probably will be. At worst, did you miss 3% of your salary? You&#x27;ll get it back in 40 years.<p>After that point, you&#x27;re going to get wildly different ideas of how to save your money. Most commonly people will suggest high risk, high return assets (stocks or stock funds, as opposed to bonds or bond-based mutual funds), since even if you lose everything, then you still have the rest of your life ahead of you. Basically what it comes down to is how to compound your earnings combined with the tax burden. Each of these have different rules as to maximum contributions per year, when you can take your money out, etc.<p>* Traditional 401k or IRA - Pre tax money, lowers your income taxes now in favor of paying tax later (you suspect your tax rate will decrease -- probably not true as a student)<p>* Roth 401k or IRA - Post tax money. Pay tax now, and none later (you suspect your taxes will go up)<p>* Brokerage accounts - Pay taxes on gains as income or capital gains (most tax, most liquidity).<p>Within each of these you can choose how to invest your money for your risk/reward tolerance. Bonds, Funds, and Stocks are how most people invest. Some choose to do real estate. Some choose to do more riskier things like derivatives. Wikipedia has a full list (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market</a>).<p>So long as you diversify, you should get an overall good return and won&#x27;t be subject to volatility in one particular investment. However, due to minimum investments for the first few years it&#x27;s probably best to diversify over time, rather than right from the beginning.<p>I graduated 2 years ago, so I&#x27;ve had to brush up on all of this stuff, along with supplemental benefits like AD&D, life insurance, etc. If you have any questions my email is in my profile.",1378268012

6325469,comment,6317851,6318176,1,0,gsnedders,,,"As someone who&#x27;s been around the web platform and standards orgs for a number of years (on browser-side stuff, since 2006; working at Opera 20092013), I&#x27;d like to say that I think almost everyone working on browser engines (be it at MS, at Apple, at Google, at Mozilla, formally at Opera  and hopefully again in future) really care, quite deeply, about making the web a better place. From my viewpoint, what differs most is the views of those higher up in the organizations.<p>Certainly, the amount of resources people put behind stuff varies (Mozilla obviously cares deeply, to the extent of it being their foremost mission; Opera has historically cared about it deeply  it used to be a point that a disproportionate amount of specs were edited by Opera employee  and it is part of their &quot;vision&quot;), but at the end of the day, as an intern you&#x27;re likely to be working with those directly alongside you almost exclusively.<p>If you care about working somewhere where people are truly passionate about what they&#x27;re doing  go for any browser vendor working on an engine (I say this as to exclude Opera  while there are some contributions flowing from there, they are relatively sparse in number  though I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised for this to change back to them investing heavily in their browser engine as their Blink-based products enter the market). Yes, in many ways Mozilla are probably the best (as there&#x27;s no question that this view goes all the way to the top), but don&#x27;t rule out the others.",1378267466

I&#x27;m going through my school directly, trying to set up introductory classes, but I imagine that could be pretty different from school to school. Mine&#x27;s private so they have functionally unlimited discretion on how to arrange their curriculum, particularly their non-core ones.<p>Also, a big obstacle I&#x27;ve faced with my proposals is the AP Computer Science course. The course is taught in Java which is not great, but the curriculum is definitely not the best even for Java. Being a junior, you may or may not have taken that yet, but that might be a thing to think about.",1378267424

I suspect they might be thinking of backdooring the truecrypt <i>client</i>, which, really wouldn&#x27;t make it much of a feat.<p>The container format itself is really just a giant mathematical mess -- there really isn&#x27;t anything to backdoor there.<p>And then the client doesn&#x27;t exactly dial-out to anything when you mount an encrypted volume.  Therefore I would suggest that this is probably a matter of using alternative means of access to the machine in order to patch the client itself.<p>That wouldn&#x27;t exactly be worthy of the attention of the NSA, given that truecrypt <i>is</i> open-source.",1378267299

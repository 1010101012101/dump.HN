1700943,comment,1700454,1700454,0,0,DiabloD3,,,"Don't forget what the 6502 was in. The NES used it, the Apple II used it, and the C64, and a few early arcade games, and the early Ataris. The SNES used the 16 bit variant of it called the 65C816, as did the Apple IIGS.<p>Interesting side note: The Apple IIGS could run normal Apple II 8bit software and GS-only 16bit software... Nintendo had planned the same for the SNES, but bailed on the idea early on, afraid of the backwards compatibility cannibalizing SNES game sales.<p>Sony, who was an important part of designing the SNES, produced the SPC700 sound DSP (which had a 6502-like instruction set, its own RAM, and a normal DSP companion core to do mixing, panning, volume, and filtering).<p>Incidentally, Sony had a working prototype for a add-on CD drive for the SNES (it used the expansion port on the bottom most people didn't know existed, and the SNES would sit on the drive). The drive also included a secondary independent 65C816, sorta like SA-1 chip used in Super Mario RPG (which ran 3x faster, had its own RAM, could MMIO and DMA to hardware in the SNES and interrupt the main CPU to do so).<p>By the time Sony was ready to ship the device with Nintendo, the SegaCD add-on for the Genesis had already crashed and burned, and Nintendo decided to back out because they thought CDs had no future for gaming.<p>Sony decided to make their own console, replacing the Super Nintendo ""component"" of their CD add-on, and produced the Playstation. The Playstation sound chip was similar to the SPC700 (but vastly enhanced for CD quality audio), but the rest of the Playstation was decidedly not like a SNES.<p>Sony, during the development of the Playstation 2, decided to add backwards compatibility as a feature when Nintendo didn't.",1284728199

Browsing the web and writing long emails like a normal user, rather than like a tablet user: no weird issues with mouseover, <i>fully-functional</i> built-in Flash, etc, etc. There are lots of differences between the web experience offered by Android and the web experience offered by Chrome OS.<p>Also, normal people won't have to make a decision in a store about picking ""Android"" vs ""Chrome OS"". It's more and more likely that people will pick from the limited few options in the store, and maybe try it out before buying it. If a store sells laptops and some run Windows, some Mac OS X and some Chrome OS, then Chrome OS will be a serious competitor at least in the netbook form-factor.<p>Tablets are often sold in different parts of a store, or at least together in a different display.

However, as someone who has been on the ad sales side of the equation, I can tell you that all sales are emotional and the more time you spend explaining to people how to properly price out the product the less likely they are to buy. Literally the more rational you make it for the person to buy your product the less likely they are to actually buy it, because the rational part of the brain isn't the part of the brain that buys stuff.<p>In addition, I'd argue that what makes advertising not-unethical is that the vast majority of businesses lose money on any given ad buy. If advertising was just a license to print money for all businesses instead of, say, the best 5% of businesses then it would be pretty hard to argue that advertising was making the world a better place. While Groupon may well have been at fault here, the small business owner does have some responsibility to understand how advertising works, what the best practices are, what asset they are trying to build, etc. If the business owner in question understood this then it wouldn't really matter that they didn't understand every last feature on the site.

Windows servers are too expensive for me making scale-out strategies a PITA and IMHO technically inferior to Linux from a startup perspective.<p>Biztalk/Webspark are nice initiatives, but not enough.<p>And I would totally shell out the cash for a MSDN subscription / Visual Studio if I could choose Linux for deployment.<p>Better yet, collaborate more with the Mono project from Novell. Open-source more of the .NET platform.<p>The few open-source projects from Microsoft built around .NET don't really have an open-source development methodology ... let others contribute to the DLR, IronPython and IronRuby.

Did not seem to be better than a day job. Being a well-recognized, top freelancer with special skills and good connections: that's good. But being an average freelancer does not seem to be very appealing.
On the other hand at my startup I can create things which my bosses and customers did not even think of. Most fun software problems are not eceonomical to solve in very high quality for one client, but it is economical to solve if you can sell it as a product to lots of clients. This possibility of 'scale' makes startups very different. On the other hand the success rate it much lower. I have failed projects behind me, I know what failure is, but I've learned a lot from them, and still I try again (beside my day-job).",1284725393

This is possible - users <i>don't care</i> whether they are using web applications or actual apps, but there are huge benefits (in terms of what you can do) to desktop applications. This is evident in the amazing rise of Apple's App Store.<p>But there's a problem. Web programming, while allowing generally crummier applications, has some benefits that far outweigh this. This is why startups tend to focus on web applications - they're just so much better for startups, for a few reasons. Find a way to give these benefits with desktop applications, and you'll have people rushing back to Windows programming, because you <i>can</i> give a much richer use experience.<p>The benefits of web apps are:<p>* Not having to worry about deployment.<p>* Not having to worry about versioning (because the deployment forces everyone to have the latest version).<p>* Being able to collect feedback almost automatically, ala Google Analytics. Preferably all kinds of different feedback about exactly how people are using your application.<p>* Making life easier for the end user - no install, no configuration of things like which folders files are saved in (all the data is saved online automatically), etc.<p>At the end of the day, all of this is achievable outside of the browser - it just requires a completely new framework for creating applications, which gives all these benefits for free. Not all desktop applications will be able to use it, but this will allow rich applications to be made without sacrificing the amazing benefits written above, which is why so many people turn to the web.<p>P.S. I don't know much about Silverlight, which <i>might</i> be Microsoft's attempt to do just what I've outlined above.

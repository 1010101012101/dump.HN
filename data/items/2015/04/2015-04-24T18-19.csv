The Pebble app is still there, and you can still use it.<p>For now.<p>A better analogy would be if Amazon suddenly refused to stock new Apple TVs and Rokus and Chromecasts in its warehouses and only stocked Fire TV devices, if we want to get all semantic about it.<p>> This whole uproar is about a single developer who had his app denied<p>There are multiple apps affected per the linked discussion.<p>> by a specific reviewer at Apple<p>No, by multiple reviewers on multiple occasions.  Even appealing the decision results in the same response (&quot;don&#x27;t reference Pebble in your metadata&quot;).<p>> for a basic breach of their terms and conditions for putting Apps on the App Store<p>That&#x27;s only being enforced for Pebble-related apps now that the Apple Watch has been released.<p>> The general consensus seems to be that a simple rewording (maybe not even having to remove the word &#x27;Pebble&#x27;) is all that he needs.<p>Apple&#x27;s response (when SeaNav tried to appeal) was specifically to remove the word &quot;Pebble&quot;.  It&#x27;s not a wording issue; it&#x27;s an issue with that specific word existing in the metadata.<p>> Also, a theater buying a TV/Radio station and not allowing competing theaters to run ads is perfectly acceptable and realistic.<p>That&#x27;s not what the more accurate scenario describes; you&#x27;re still getting this backwards.  It&#x27;s the TV/Radio station <i>buying/building a competing theater</i> and preventing new ads from existing theaters that the corrected scenario describes.<p>> Just because one gets very large and popular doesn&#x27;t suddenly mean the rules have to change for it.<p>Yes they do, per U.S. and European (at the very least; probably others are included) antitrust laws.  Using one&#x27;s market position to conspire to monopolize runs afoul of them.<p>And even if it weren&#x27;t strictly <i>illegal</i> per se, it sure as hell doesn&#x27;t mean that we should just lay back and let Apple do what it wants.

You can do a lot more with a UI testing DSL like Selenium or Watir than with something like this. They wave that off as &#x27;you probably don&#x27;t have the skills available,&#x27; but the thing is that people who do have the skills around Selenium or other UI frameworks aren&#x27;t -that- rare or expensive.<p>Further, I personally haven&#x27;t found this kind of testing to necessarily be easier than coding, at least for any even mildly interesting interface. The main skills around UI testing aren&#x27;t really about knowing what fields to point at and what to click, they&#x27;re more around:<p>* How and what do you reliably verify? What&#x27;s really invariant in a session and what&#x27;s not?<p>* How do you write code so that your tests are robust?<p>They say these are maintainable but record/playback tests typically aren&#x27;t very resistant to minor flow, identifier, or container/ownership changes like new divs. Neither are coded tests, necessarily, but they&#x27;re usually a little easier to abstract for that stuff and they&#x27;re generally a <i>lot</i> easier to debug to fix when things go off the rails.<p>And having or consulting a skilled automation engineer will go a long way towards telling you how to write your app code to make sure that&#x27;s true.<p>* How you do you deal with timing issues?<p>Knowing how to effectively do synchronization (wait for this before doing that) is more than just putting in the sync request, it&#x27;s knowing what to sync on. Sometimes it&#x27;s not something a record/playback system can see visually. That means these sorts of systems usually end up recording hard delays, but those aren&#x27;t very resistant to variations in network timing. You also have to prune out delays because the human doing the recording was thinking for a moment from delays that are actually necessary.<p>They also make your tests run slower in the best or even normal case, and these folks charge per minute.<p>* How do you always start from a known state and deal with test fixtures (starting data)?<p>This isn&#x27;t trivial if they&#x27;re pointing at your production app, and it saves any kind of state. It may or may not be trivial pointing at a test instance.<p>* How do you recover if a test has a problem?<p>This is easier on a web app because you can generally go back to a home page, but if you have to clean up half-done data or operations it&#x27;s not necessarily trivial either.<p>And finally, with a system like this:<p>* How do you work around its limitations?<p>That&#x27;s a skillset in itself. It&#x27;s one of the reasons I don&#x27;t like this sort of thing much. What you learn doing standard UI testing is pretty portable. What you learn figuring out the quirks of a keyword/flowchart system is generally not.<p>Last consideration is:<p>* How do you review the test for correctness?<p>This is a hell of a lot easier looking at code than it generally is going through a one-keyword/node at a time flowchart with a crapload of dropdowns.<p>Now, to be fair:<p>* When you&#x27;re at minimum viable product and it&#x27;s not doing much, this could be a ok bootstrap test system. There are local record/playback tools with a better growth curve, but they do probably have a bigger ramp.<p>* If your app is completely deterministic and your tests actually need no logic whatsoever, record/playback can be pretty solid.<p>* If cleaning up sessions is as simple as deleting a user or something, some of the concerns around fixtures go away.<p>* Though there&#x27;s testing dogma to never record/playback, it&#x27;s BS (like most dogma). Sometimes it is actually cheaper to re-record tests than fix them. Depends on how much massaging you had to do after recording, mostly, and how many tests you have.<p>* And on that subject, just 10-20 good user scenario UI tests can do a -ton- for basic risk mitigation even on a complex codebase. Most companies actually overspec UI suites considerably. The majority of tests should be coded at unit/component level, or at least hermetic (not end to end, no external servers). End to end UI tests are for your most important scenarios, not for every edge case--they&#x27;re too fragile and maintenance heavy.<p>But ultimately, I think companies will usually be better served with investing in a longer-term and more flexible solution than this for their test coding, and go to something more like SauceLabs or some other hosted execution service for the automated runs.<p>Honestly, if Usetrace would just separate the coding part from the running part and offer the keyword/flow-style-speccing as a &quot;value add&quot; for people who don&#x27;t want to do traditional scripts, I&#x27;d be more likely to say this could be a pretty cool solution. But right now there&#x27;s no ramp from &quot;super-limited test&quot; to &quot;flexible test,&quot; and that&#x27;s a real paint yourself in the corner kind of problem.",1429901596

I see the same &quot;Enterprise&quot; patterns used over and over again, because that&#x27;s the way it is done not because it&#x27;s even a good fit.  And this is from someone in that age group... so I can definitely understand it.<p>On the flip side, it&#x27;s been over a decade since I&#x27;ve looked at a lot of things at a lower level (implemented a b-tree or quick-sort) or even really used a fully compiled language; favoring .Net, JavaScript and other scripted languages.  The kinds of things that Google/MS and others seem to screen for just don&#x27;t interest me as much as building a distributed system that can handle scale and load consistently.  I&#x27;ve never been a fan of OO and tend to favor more functional patterns.  Almost every time I&#x27;ve looked at a Java or .Net solution I cringe as there&#x27;s always a number of design patterns that don&#x27;t fit well, and implemented by any number of people who I wouldn&#x27;t consider craftsmen.<p>People tend to get too comfortable with a given situation... I think after the bubble burst around 2000 a pretty large divide was created between those before the bubble and those since... Especially given that a lot of people came in and left software development during the early 2000&#x27;s... I see a lot of people 35+ and a lot of people under 30.. and a bit of a gap in between.  It&#x27;s almost a given that ageism is bound to flourish in the environment.<p>A lot of attention is given to bringing more women into technology in terms of using &quot;inclusive phrasing&quot;, having recently had an interesting discussion following someone come into an IRC channel and asking, &quot;can one of you guys help me with something&quot;.

Collected odd recipes to cook, outfits to wear, and trophies and achievements. I loved having the &#x27;two ring&#x27; which was one better than the One Ring.<p>But as others point out, the &#x27;traditional&#x27; way to build an MMO is &#x27;learn skills by levelling up / start playing at max level&#x27; The game set a number of challenges for &#x27;max level&#x27; characters which depended on gear, group composition, and various strategies to overcome the game mechanics. That is where it failed for me.<p>In WoW while leveling you often needed to join up with groups to run through a local dungeon together. It was fun when you had a good group, annoying when you had children in the group. There were too many ways for 10 - 12 yr old boys to grief people.<p>In an effort to increase its appeal, Blizzard changed it again and again. Skill changes, techniques, complexity was removed, buffs and nerfs to various skills. Lots of change and slowly less and less appeal. All of the components were there to make it better (arenas were a great testing ground for devs to evaluate PvP changes).<p>I stopped playing when Mists shipped. It was just too stupid at that point and the similarity to kung-fu panda to stark. Oddly, if you could provide servers that stopped at one of the expansions (Wrath or maybe even Cataclysm) I would still be spending money with Blizzard, but now not so much.<p>I look at it periodically and see the makings of a durable world/gaming simulation environment.

The value of the SCOTUS to Conservatives is that it provides the ultimate bulwark against the power of the vote, which - in a fully franchised system - would banish contemporary Conservatism from national politics completely. If our warped electoral system finally crumbles under a liberal court, it will take a lot more that a restoration of a Conservative majority to reimpose it.<p>It&#x27;s not overstating the case to say that losing the next Presidential election will mark the Conservative movement&#x27;s final chapter. This is the movement that started with Barry Goldwater, came to fruition under Reagan, began to wobble badly when Gingrich became Speaker of the House, and shit the bed completely under Bush. Since then, we&#x27;ve been living in an interregnum. The old order is damaged beyond all repair, but still had enough residual strength and momentum to keep its replacement from solidifying. But if they lose the Court - which they are sure to do if Dems win the White House in 2016, the electoral reforms that will be the death of them have a clear path to victory.<p>Reduced to total political impotence, the bubble of lunacy, fear, hate, and anger that keeps platforms like Fox News in business will finally deflate.

Could you explain how this applies to your argument?<p>If, after 45 years, you don&#x27;t have a basic grasp of CS , <i>and</i> you were doing a CS job for 45 years, it doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me you will gain one soon.<p>If you were a math professor for the past 10 years, yeah, i can understand that.<p>&quot;People don&#x27;t stop learning as they age, &quot;<p>Whether this is true or not, after 45 years, they haven&#x27;t learned any better than the guy with 1 year of experience.<p>&quot;What people have achieved or not in their careers is not your business, when you hire.&quot;<p>????
I made an argument based on current skill level and likely future skill level.<p>&quot;You hire based on competence.&quot;<p>Sorry, For lower levels, people hire based on both current competence, and likely future competence.
Otherwise, nobody would get hired at lower levels.<p>Lawyers out of law school are incompetent. Firms hire them based on what their future rate of competence is likely to be.<p>Same with every software engineer out of college.
Nobody hires for the long term based on straight current competence. It would make no sense (short term hiring, it often does).<p>Even if you were right, then they wouldn&#x27;t get hired anyway, because they weren&#x27;t at the level one would expect after being at it for so many years.  That&#x27;s what you seem to miss. It&#x27;s your job to push yourself and grow.  You can&#x27;t seriously expect that if you haven&#x27;t grown in 45 years, someone should take a chance on you expecting that in <i>the next two</i>, you are going to buck all that and grow.<p>&quot;Assuming that people don&#x27;t grow at 99 because they&#x27;ve been at it for 45 years is stupid and ageist.&quot;
You haven&#x27;t explained why. your argument above is 100% unpersuasive.<p>I&#x27;m not even assuming. I&#x27;m pointing out that they <i>haven&#x27;t grown</i>.  Whether they can or not is actually even somewhat besides the point.<p>They <i>haven&#x27;t</i>.  So either they aren&#x27;t pushing themselves, or they can&#x27;t.  At some point, it doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t want people that don&#x27;t do either.   if you suddenly decide, after 45 years of stagnation, you want to grow in your career, you can&#x27;t expect everyone else to believe it is going to happen.<p>Let&#x27;s say it was  neither, and it was because they had a sick child for 45 years they needed to care for.  
I <i>still can&#x27;t hire them at a level the other people with 45 years of experience have</i>.  
I can&#x27;t know this, either. I can only make risk calculations based on the data i have.  Your argument is &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to make calculations about people&quot;.  Which would make hiring essentially random.<p>If i can&#x27;t hire them at the level they belong, i have to compare them against lower levels i could hire them at based on their current and future predicted competence.   When  you do this calculation, it does not come out in favor of the guy with 45 years experience.<p>&quot;In fact, it&#x27;s perfectly equivalent to say &quot;I don&#x27;t hire women in their 30s because they&#x27;ll want to have children&quot;.
&quot;<p>This is a 100% non-responsive, emotional swipe for no reason.  it&#x27;s completely and utterly false in every way, and honestly, it makes me simply not want to have a discussion with you.

The pop industry is like every other industry in that its products (songs) are defined by the last game changing technology.  Whenever a new paradigm shift occurs, two things are given:<p>1.) incumbents who rely on old technology are not all too creative (and this for already quite a while). As with other mature products it is not so much about creativity/expressing yourself but optimizing processes. At this stage (and many people don&#x27;t agree with me here) a MBA could become a pop music producer as everything is set in stone by now. Things just need to get done causing minimal costs. At this point &quot;pop music sucks&quot;<p>2.) New artists enter the scene. It is again about making the perfect product. Every few weeks you hear something really exciting. At this point it does not matter whether or not you master the new technology. What matters is that you are truly expressing yourself and this (thanks to technology) in an exciting, new way. For example, the Beatles weren&#x27;t great at using the stereo field but they started to use the &quot;modern studio&quot;  as an instrument. A few decades later, another major change in technology occurred: Producing records in your own bedroom became affordable. And so Rave music was born. By now, electronic dance music (at least the currently popular form) has matured. As a result we have (imo) to listen to shit again.",1429898545

This article only scratches the surface on <i>why</i> the old worlds are abandoned.<p>As with most modern MMOs, the endgame begins at max level. In order to help players level faster, Blizzard added a heirlooms mechanic in the second expansion (Wrath of the Lich King) to allow low levels to have above-curve gear while leveling, with a 30% EXP boost. The third expansion (Cataclysm) revamped Azeroth, making new questing much easier and straightforward, and therefore less time is spent in the old world. The fifth expansion adds Dungeon Finder, which is a faster way to level than normal questing. So there is not much incentive to explore until you hit 90 and can go to Draenor. And then once you hit Draenor, you have access to Garrisons, which is a FarmVille-like mechanic which has the easiest financial ROI in the game, making even <i>less</i> of a reason to just explore period. I did not renew my subscription.<p>Guild Wars 2 had a great solution to this; all zones have content, which the player downscales to.

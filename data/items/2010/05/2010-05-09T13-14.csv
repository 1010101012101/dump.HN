But perhaps you mean ""technical ability when hired"".  I certainly am willing to let someone learn a lot of stuff on the job, including a new language.<p>However I quibble with your last point, or at least say that some jobs require an ability to grok abstraction, recursion and/or pointers and that no amount of will can overcome an inability to do that.<p>I'll also note that some paradigms cannot be quickly learned by most.  I observed that in general for OO when it became ""the thing"" in the '90s and I suspect functional programming also takes ""more than a month"".  E.g. one thing I'm saying here is that you couldn't necessarily expect a procedural programmer who already knew C to be able to really learn C++ or Java in a month.  Yeah, they could learn how to write C in those languages, but learning the OO paradigm took longer.<p>Then again, the OO paradigms I learned (which did not include any Smalltalk ones) were both very hard (to get right) and I now think they are also very wrong.  Learning functional programming might be much easier for those with flexible minds.",1273413580

1331993,comment,1331560,1331976,0,0,jacquesm,,,"My way of addressing that part was to simply ask what the most complicated thing was they ever programmed, and then to ask one or two follow up questions about that. I've got enough field experience that just by asking that one question I'd be able to come up with a follow up question that would nail a 'poser' in one go, if the answer was satisfactory I'd let it go at that and assume they're telling the truth, if not then I would ask one or two more follow up questions and by then I'd usually know for sure if someone is fibbing or just nervous (people can be very nervous during interviews, the bigger problem to me always was to not discard 'good' people that are simply nervous and botch answers to questions rather than the fear of hiring the wrong person because they manage to bamboozle me).<p>Another thing I did was to take as much time as I wanted during an interview, I would schedule at most one interview per half day just to make sure that I didn't have to cut an interview short. This made the interview process more relaxed and on the whole gave me enough time to figure out what made someone tick. Most interviews were over very quickly anyway, but every now and then it took a long time to get a feeling for whether or not someone would fit.<p>One of my biggest discoveries was that when hiring someone good that they would refer their friends, and they would be pretty critical about who they'd refer, screening out a lot of potential duds for me without any effort on my part.<p>In the Toronto office we ended up hiring four guys that already knew each other previous to joining the company.<p>This can also work against you, another 'group of friends' applied and I would have been happy to hire just one of them, he stuck with his friends instead.<p>I once hired a guy that just wanted to learn how to program but did not yet have the ability. This was a risky move, because as a startup you don't really have the time to invest a lot of it in to a person that is not yet proven. But it worked out very well, and Jeffrey actually was one of our most reliably productive people, in part because we gave him a chance that probably nobody else would have.<p>Sometimes having a will and a drive trumps technical ability.",1273412824
1331992,comment,1331591,1331824,0,0,jakarta,,,"Looking across different disciplines for mental models can be extremely useful when identifying potential investments. It might be something that is just intuitive to you, but it is not for most people -- especially business students.<p>A good example would be Michael Burry, who had Munger's talk on human misjudgment click when analyzing the housing/mortgage market. Munger's talk about human misjudgment was rooted in psychology and how perverse incentives can cause certain breakdowns to occur which lead to disastrous decision making.<p>Let's say Burry and another analyst were looking at the same set of data during that period (early 2000s). The analyst might have just seen a great trend - loans are up, deposits are up, employment is up, house prices are up. Everything is climbing which makes it so banks appear more safe as an investment.<p>Burry on the other hand, saw that data but came to a much more alarming conclusion. Right off the bat he started wondering what incentives create such prosperity and by digging deeper he was able to uncover that loan standards were being relaxed, that people were increasingly levering up, and that some banks were giving no-doc loans.<p>So what did Burry do? He figured out the best way to go short - the credit default swap trade and he was really the first guy to do it as a means of protecting against subprime mortgages. Along the way he generated huge returns.<p>You are right - you cannot get rich from worldly wisdom alone. But, if you incorporate mental models into your investment process you can often at least help protect against the downside. That in turn helps increase your ability to generate good returns.",1273412816

They looked in the Bay Area but the salary reqs were far too high so they settled on Portland. Got a team of engineers stood up in a satellite office.

They conducted all of their engineering task assignments with daily, in-person staff meetings, verbally assigning tasks to engineers and writing down the task name in a development tracker (usually with lots of white board time).<p>A year later, the Portland team, unable to ever attend any of the daily, in-person, task assignments, and the front office unable to put together a decent set of specifications to send to a remote office, had no assignments, and a bad rep.

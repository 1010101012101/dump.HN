So if you're learning to code, probably don't need it. Code organization gets much more rigorous in larger projects. Many times noobs with small programs start applying large-project concepts to their ten-line algorithm. This is a failure of teaching -- but probably intermediate-level teaching.<p>As a metaphor, it provides a way of looking at ""where"" to put your code. Noobs don't have a lot of code, so it doesn't matter. I agree that for small problems this extra layer can be distracting.<p>But the most important part of OO has nothing to do with programming: it's OOA. This skill lets you look at your <i>problem</i>, and it's the most powerful thing I've experienced for solving large problems. Functional Programming puts all the symbols and problem-space in your head at one time -- you become the linker. OOA lets you play with ways to solve a problem without writing any code and without taxing your noodle at all. You deal with small, atomic blocks and their relationships with each other. This skill is an absolute necessity, even if the student never touches an object the rest of their career. It's also one that's the most lacking in regular programmers.",1300361166

Everything else is there to support and make it easier to apply this concept.<p>Of course you don't need OOP for every problem, because you don't need polymorphism for every problem. And applied improperly, every type of polymorphism (whether it's ad-hoc with early or late binding, or parametric) is <i>broken</i>, not to mention hard to explain.<p>And as an exercise, I want you to count the number of applications where you haven't used any type of polymorphism. The only ones I can count myself are the small exercises of the types I used to do in high-school.<p>See what I did there?",1300361038

Referential transparency guarantees that a pure function given inputs X and Y always returns the same output Z.

There are actual non-technical issues here that prevent streaming services from offering those options, that this company completely avoids. Language dubs and subtitle tracks are separately copyrighted works and the streaming services would have to negotiate separately for every possible combination. Sometimes the French dub of a movie is owned by a different company than the English one; the English subtitles for a Japanese TV series are owned by a different company than the Japanese one, etc. The DVD publisher already negotiated the rights for the language and subtitle tracks on the disc, so streaming a physical DVD gets you access to them, where Netflix might never be able to negotiate rights to the same combinations.",1300360644

Forever services like blockbuster depended on your not being able to share your movie with everyone you know in the two days you rent it. But now that you can, companies like this one are sending a wake up call to producers holding new licenses and telling them that the old model just won't work. Maybe the music and book industries can take a hint (and much of everything else once we all have fabbers in our offices and studies). Maybe movies should only come out as downloadable non sharable files, for a third of the price. They'd need excellent security, but I can't imagine the world pointing in any other direction.

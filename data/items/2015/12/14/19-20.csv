That&#x27;s a clear problem, and robs many of our brighter kids of years spent in prep for jobs that don&#x27;t exist.  Doing that deliberately is malignant and should end.<p>How to correct the problem?  Start by <i>requiring</i> universities to inform incoming students AT ALL LEVELS of two things:<p>1) Given the forthcoming degree, what jobs await them?  Report job trends for their graduates in the past 20 years, including what job titles they take at what employers.<p>2) What will this education cost them?  Report the range of student debt for students over that same 20 years, including repayment horizons.<p>Much needs to change in academia, and it starts with a full accounting of the cost and market value of a degree, especially when a significant market value is <i>expected</i>.<p>(It&#x27;s worth noting that nowhere would the benefit of doing this be greater than countering the for-profit degree mills that abound in recent years.  But in the end, the damage done by teaching useless skills at a good university is little different than failing to teach useful ones at a bad university.)",1450123127

Here we (appear to) <i>have</i> a free-market system, so, one must <i>validate</i> all the slurs actually apply before just flinging them at the existing system.<p>If free-market health is so guaranteed to be so utterly disastrous, instead of flinging quasi-racist slurs at the Indians, why don&#x27;t you actually go find the guaranteed-disasters in progress? Ought to be pretty easy if it&#x27;s even one-tenth as bad as everyone always claims in the US context.<p>(Though I&#x27;ll warn you in advance I&#x27;m going to account for the situation on the ground; if the doctor&#x27;s office in a far-flung village with a per-capita income of 50$/year isn&#x27;t up to US standards, I&#x27;m not going to award you many points.

[0]<p>> If anti-capitalism isn&#x27;t about abolishing those things, what do it&#x27;s proponents advocate?<p>Mostly, altering the conception of property rights and economic arrangements to de-emphasize the role of profit to be captured by capital in some significant (but not always <i>all</i>, or even <i>most</i>) economic interactions, increase social control of some of the rights associated with ownership in the capitalist system (though not necessarily to the exclusion of private ownership rights) of productive \ncapital.<p><i>Anti-capitalists</i> are a fairly diverse lots, so the differences will be fairly stark without a lot of commonality. Opposition to capitalism doesn&#x27;t mean supporting the same alternatives to it. (Strictly speaking, supporters of the modern mixed economy are a kind of &quot;anti-capitalists&quot; who support a particular -- and currently dominant -- replacement of capitalism.)<p>[0] This provides a basic rundown, though its perhaps less clear which of these elements are <i>consequences</i> and which <i>defining features</i>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_(Marxist_theory)#Defining_structural_criteria"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_mode_of_production_...</a>",1450122649

There are a few inferences or projections made by Eric Jackson that seem a wee bit uninformed, but generally it is a thorough shredding of Marissa&#x27;s tenure. Particularly, I was amazed at how many acquisitions Yahoo&#x27;s made. Trying to stimulate product lines growth through rapid-fire successive acquisitions is testament of how nebulous or illformed the mobile strategy was. I remember at some point Marissa declaring Yahoo as a &#x27;mobile&#x27; or &#x27;mobile-first&#x27; company, that&#x27;s all well and good but you need clear signaling on what kind of mobile engagements should be fostered. Looking at the haphazard consumption, it&#x27;s hard to argue a case for talent acquisition. Rather she was trying to widen Yahoo&#x27;s net as quick as possible. If deliberate and engaged, her acquisitions would&#x27;ve matured splendidly under the Yahoo umbrella , but Yahoo chewed more than it could handle (Too much influx creates a bit of tumult and drains resources/managerial harmony. Interesting what impact on company culture these potential fiefdoms had). Looking at individual acquisitions themselves, I really am surprised Yahoo bought: Summly (an app that had no ip at all and basically licensed the core technology. Perhaps she bought it out of hype it had garnered?) or Polyvore (a startup that seemed quite dead in the water as Eric attests with no evident means of fruitful integration into Yahoo. Seems a wee bit nepotic desire influenced the acquisition). Tumblr, on the other hand, was an excellent purchase. Still I wonder, what is the long-term plan of integrating it or expanding on its success?",1450121785

I mean take Jean-Marie le Pen, father (and indeed still alive) of Marine le Pen who just doubled her seats in a record election result for her party Front National in France, he&#x27;s been accused of torture of Algerians in credible French newspapers and books, none of this is all that long ago. And hell that&#x27;s in Algeria, a lot of people don&#x27;t know of things like the Paris Massacre, where French protesters were killed and thrown in the Seine, some of them tortured, by government forces. That&#x27;s just absolutely shocking, the moment you kill civilians and throw them in the river (i.e. they&#x27;re not even pretending these civilians were a threat, were killed in self-defence, then brought in for identification, investigation and ultimately buried by family... but rather just murdered and ditched in the nearest river), you know something is really fucked up and indeed it feels very recent.<p>Anyway, the colonial atrocities are one thing, but the effects of colonialism are still very much felt today. Take Angola for example, independent in 1975 (quite recent) after a 13 year (nasty) war for independence, but embroiled right after in a civil war that ended only in 2002, lasting more than 25 years. The latter is in many ways a product of the former. A bit simplistic of course, but ultimately the colonial story is one of arbitrary geographical borders being drawn, exploitation, a bloody independence movement, and a post-colonial consolidation/playing-out of the various ethnic groups that were arbitrarily grouped together in a new nation state, who often have different cultures, political ideas and are all driven by their own desire for self-determination. This process is bloody, too, it&#x27;s like grouping the US, Canada and Mexico in one big area, having them partially mingle for a century, and then allowing their independence once more, having them fight for the establishment of new borders of their new nation states. It&#x27;s not pretty, especially when you do it in some of the poorest and least educated areas in the world. It&#x27;s really sad, but the post-colonial era too is one in which we have more blame than we behave like we do.",1450121414

Let windows do it&#x27;s check, then actually shut it down (don&#x27;t suspend it).  That should have been the end of that.  If /that/ never works then something else is seriously messed up (at best some deeply integrated &#x27;anti virus&#x27; software) and a re-install is warranted anyway.<p>My typical procedure after that is to dd copy the start of the disk (up to a few 10s of MB in to the largest partition) and also the end (if GPT), re-read the partition table of the new disk, then use ntfsclone (linux command) on the big partition.  If I&#x27;m feeling fancy I&#x27;ll also pre-copy the end of the old NTFS partition to the same offset in the new one.  AFTER booting Windows once you can grow the partition to take on the new space.",1450119974

10733052,comment,10730020,10730020,0,0,not_that_noob,,,"To translate to a more familiar domain, think about the SATs. After a period of study, students take the SAT where they get back the composite score of how they did, but never the actual answers to the questions on the test.<p>Now imagine a student can take the test repeatedly over the space of a few days, and can use the score to reverse engineer the answers to the questions. They can put in random answers and note which ones cause the score to go up. Of course the real life SATs don&#x27;t allow this, and they change up the questions to prevent this sort of cheating. If this were possible, our enterprising/cheating student can derive the complete answer key over time, noting the changes in scores for each run. And once they have the key, they can ace the test. No longer is it a test of their aptitude, but rather of their knowledge of the answer key.<p>This scandal is analogous to this albeit contrived example. With an ML testset, it&#x27;s not possible to change the data because you want it standardized so you can evaluate improvements that new approaches may bring. It&#x27;s the only way to have a meaningful yardstick to measure against. Thus, the only way to prevent such gaming is restricting multiple submissions, so that you can&#x27;t do &#x27;hyperparameter optimization&#x27; - i.e. overlearn on the testset.<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s cheating - it&#x27;s not a measure of how well your algorithm did, but rather on how well you reverse-engineered the answer key. It&#x27;s a huge disservice to the field and the people who did this should be ashamed of themselves.",1450119903

On the other hand, William Faulkner was also right:<p><pre><code>  The past is never dead.\n  It&#x27;s not even past.\n</code></pre>\nBut I&#x27;ll add that the past isn&#x27;t very evenly distributed either. The Cambrian explosion has a positive feedback loop: between any two technologies there is a niche in which another technology may develop. There&#x27;s not just a combinatorial explosion of technologies, tools, and ideas...it&#x27;s fueling itself.<p>For better or worse, most of the explosion will die because the system is brittle.

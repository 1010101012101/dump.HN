Firstly, there might be some superior option nobody told me about, or that I didn&#x27;t think of.  Secondly, defining &quot;what I want&quot; as &quot;what was available to me&quot; amounts to rationalizing economics backwards into psychology while ignoring the available empirical evidence.

10195777,comment,10191668,10195715,0,0,burntsushi,,,"I never meant to imply that any one tool is a panacea. If this is an argument you think I&#x27;m making, then let&#x27;s just squash that right now: I&#x27;m not. What I&#x27;m suggesting is that we have thought through this very problem and come up with a number of ways to mitigate it. We don&#x27;t want to see the ecosystem fragmented. Cargo is one strategy. Blessed crates are another. In particular:<p>> To be clear, I agree that a small standard library has its own downsides. In particular, quality is IMO on of the best arguments against a small standard library. Fortunately, we trying to mitigate this by adopting officially blessed libraries into the `rust-lang` organization: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1242-rust-lang-crates.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1242-rust...</a> --- This allows us to avoid the problems with a big standard library (too much stuff that is hard to evolve because of stability) while still providing quality with crates that we promise to maintain.<p>I could absolutely see one of these crates providing async IO. I am less sure of seeing it wind up in std. Some examples of crates that are currently on track to being blessed---but maybe never end up in std---are regex and rand.<p>I disagree with adding good package tooling after-the-fact and using its failure in preventing fragmentation as a reason for why Cargo will be ineffective. Overcoming inertia is hard. Having Cargo at the outset is a nice advantage we have working in our favor. We should acknowledge that.<p>> If Rust already has std/net, this is not that far of a gap to close.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty big gap IMO, especially if you want to provide a common high level interface. std::net is a portable interface around platform specific APIs and not much else. Async IO is quite a bit more involved.<p>> I&#x27;m not suggesting a Python-esque stdlib. I&#x27;m suggesting a multi-threaded, cross-platform, (ideally, edge-triggered) event system, above which higher level primitives can be introduced and safely interoperate.<p>Note that my comment was specifically about arguing against a Python-esque stdlib, or rather, in favor of a small standard library. It was not meant to target omission of any one particular feature, which is what you seem to be focused on. (The criticism I responded to was not specific to async IO.)",1441849860

10195773,comment,10192711,10194525,0,0,npunt,,,"> We see less and less such ideas from Apple.<p>Disagree. This is a really commonly held viewpoint that I think is the product of our fast news cycles, and I don&#x27;t think it approaches truth for another several years.<p>You are totally right that iPod and iPhone were not the first. While these were <i>cool products</i> when they came out, I think what&#x27;s often lost is that it was only in the years of incremental improvements that defined how important these products were.<p>Tons of use cases are being unlocked in health, education, home automation, transportation, payments, enterprise, etc that these markets have been waiting for and wanting and are truly transformative. They&#x27;re just not talked about as much, or hit that level of &#x27;omg&#x27; for people who aren&#x27;t dealing with those use cases, but they&#x27;re real. The less sexy incremental stuff is amazing, and in fact, way more interesting because so few companies get the details right.<p>Just like you&#x27;re saying about not being first, most blow-your-mind ideas that will come out in the next 10 years are probably already thought of, prototyped, or launched in some highly crippled form to an extremely limited audience. Two amazing things we can assume are in the pipeline are:<p>1. Driverless car, which will fundamentally change our transportation infrastructure.<p>2. Eye tracking and face tracking, which unlock new interaction paradigms that are even more natural and seamless. See the recent Faceshift acquisition [1] for evidence.<p>These are going to be awesome! But they&#x27;ll take time to perfect.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what qualifies as innovations for you. I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m not blown away by today&#x27;s stuff, it is S-cycle after all, but I am impressed by the way they&#x27;ve implemented 3D touch. Its the first force touch implementation (vs watch and macbook) that I really like because it looks incredibly intuitive and everyday useful - like something that I&#x27;ll wonder how I lived without.<p>Well anyway, I think we&#x27;d probably agree about a lot things, but I&#x27;d be curious as to what big innovation you&#x27;ve got in mind that&#x27;s missing.

For some, who have served at CENTCOM for more than a decade, scars remained from the run-up to the 2003 war in Iraq, when poorly written intelligence reports suggesting Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, when it did not, formed the basis of the George W. Bush administrationâ€™s case for war.</i><p>I&#x27;m reminded of the quote from Karl Rove dismissing the &quot;reality-based community&quot; as subordinate and inferior to &quot;history&#x27;s actors&quot; which shape reality according to their whims. Of course the mindset goes back a lot further than that, and more than the American government is guilty of it, but in the US intelligence community it seems to have gotten a real shot in the arm during the Bush administration. Unfortunately, like many other terrible precedents set during that Presidency, our current President has done little to reverse it.<p>If we&#x27;ve really gotten to the point where anyone in Washington can question whether &quot;solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality&quot; as though there is even a debate to be had there, without being laughed out of the city, then the real mystery of American government is how it manages to function as well as it does.

It is not the first time that people try to pitch the idea that AD is a prion disease.<p>Apart from a few very powerful individuals in the field, most scientists believe that the amyloid depositions DO NOT CAUSE the disease, but maybe they are a part of the pathophysiological process (immuno response?). Some facts:
-Do you see the depositions in healthy individuals? Yes (but fewer mostly in certain areas of the brain)
-Do the levels of the amyloid deposition correlate with the degree of dementia? No concensus
-Do amyloid deposition in vitro induce neurodegeneration or abnormal electrophysiology? No
-Have all drugs so far with published data of phase III clinical trials based on the amyloid hypothesis failed? Yes (maybe the last one not miserably)<p>But the problem is that the amyloid cascade hypothesis is at this point the only working hypothesis for AD and people do not want to lose their grant money or positions in pharma and go back to begin from scratch to find what is really causing AD.<p>Source: I work in AD research.",1441849392

10195739,comment,10191540,10195446,0,0,btilly,,,"I&#x27;ve personally worked on code bases at these thresholds.  Here is my resulting opinion.<p>A junior programmer can do < 2k lines.  Think a stand alone command-line tool.  This is indeed something that a single person can understand.  Learning skills around modularity and consistency gets you beyond this.<p>A mid-level developer can do < 20k lines.  You may have one or several people on the team, but it is still small enough that you can pretty much know the whole thing.  An example of something at this size is a typical Ruby website.  To get beyond this you need to have a pattern to your organization, and a good sense of how to create and maintain abstraction layers between different parts of the system.<p>A 200k system is small enough for a senior developer to navigate and understand without significant documentation, and can be created by a small team.  The architecture has to be clear, but you don&#x27;t need specialized documentation.  When it comes time to add or find something, the overall architecture and patterns will tell you where to look.  You may land in unfamiliar code, but you will know that it has to be there, and roughly what it has to be.  As for size, a small to medium company can run on this much code.  For example I was at Rent.com when we were sold to eBay for over $400 million in 2004.  This was about how much code we had.<p>At 2M, there are a lot of teams.  You may have specific tooling just to help you maintain sanity.  You definitely have documentation.  There are so many people doing so many things that you cannot rely on people following key conventions, instead you are likely to try to enforce them.  Examples of projects at this general size would be a browser like Chrome, a compiler like gcc, and so on.<p>What about 20 million lines of code?  These are large projects carried out by large organizations over many years.  Examples that I have seen include the current Linux kernel, Windows NT 4.0, and eBay circa 2006.  The specialized tooling that was being considered for a 2 million line project is now required, and there is a lot of it.  Documentation is extensive.  Figuring out who to talk to to find out about something can be a struggle.  And so on.<p>What about larger than that?  There are few examples that have turned out well.  The only person who I personally believe has done it well is <a href=""http://research.google.com/people/jeff/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.google.com/people/jeff/</a>, and I&#x27;m firmly of the belief that without him Google could not have become what they did.<p>As for what is fun, I personally like the 200k project size best.  It isn&#x27;t fun until you have the skills to contribute well.  But once you do, you have the complexity while still having a team small enough that you can personally know everyone who is involved.  But YMMV.",1441849299

The users could apply layout algorithms AND modify the grqph by moving nodes and edges around. From time to time, nodes and edges would be added and removed by the system.<p>So there&#x27;s a distinction there between the graph, and layout of the graph ie x,y coordinates of nodes, and routing of edges. What would version control track? This is a non trivial problem imo. Edit; specifically, storing a graph in some canonical form so that trivial changes would not create massive &#x27;false positives&#x27; in the diff. For example changing an edge indicatin an entire sub graph was added or removed. The problem is similar to xml tree diffing.<p>This is why I think versioning in these tools is pretty much non existent, imo of course.",1441849182

10195677,comment,10193796,10193796,0,0,cegev,,,"As someone who is often incorrectly seen as being like this (and looking on Facebook, the author and I seem to have no shortage of mutual friends), the article is fascinating, even if I don&#x27;t agree with some of the things being said.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to accurately experience the life of another time period. Minor, seemingly insignificant details can have significant effects on the experience. One example I like to use was an event some friends of mine attended that was trying to recreate the experience of a Regency era country house. The hostess, not being particularly experienced in organizing such a thing, didn&#x27;t think about lighting.<p>Yet lighting is extremely important. It dictates the hours that people keep, how people interact, and the appearance of much of what one sees after dark. My friends pointed out the problem, and had all the lighting replaced with candles and lamps. What some there thought would be a minor improvement in environment and accuracy ended up having startling effects: several guests, all adults, having always been accustomed to the constant light of electric lamps, found the ubiquitous moving shadows in a country house lit only by flames to be terrifying, and many of them became insistent that they were seeing flitting supernatural apparitions. One was reportedly unable to walk up the stairs to her room by herself.<p>Finding all these seemingly minor changes necessary to recreate an experience, knowing what impact they have, and actually being able to change them, is extremely difficult. One thing that immediately jumps out at me, for example, is that the visibility and lack of distortion through the windows in the photographs, and the pane sizes, makes me think they have panes of float glass. How important is this to the experience? I don&#x27;t know. It certainly changes the way the outside world appears. Are their mirrors made with float glass? Are they looking at the photographs of them? Both would significantly change their own self-images.<p>And while I would love to know the tailor her husband uses, I do have to wonder about whether the reproductions are actually accurate. Fabric, for example, has changed considerably in the last hundred and fifty years. Over a century of breeding and improved techniques mean that wool today is far finer, and fine wool far cheaper, than it was in the Victorian era. Obtaining wool of the correct coarseness and weight would likely involve commissioning it. Tailoring has evolved, too: understanding of cutting and particularly fitting techniques improved considerably in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Is their tailor intentionally ignoring those advances? I doubt it.<p>Even beyond these visible issues, there are differences in upbringing, in culture, and in perspective. There are differences in surroundings: the building I live in may be almost 120 years old and in its original state in many ways, but the sounds here are completely different. And there are differences in the people around you. These are not things that can be changed, and they have significant impacts.<p>The differences in perspective are particularly visible in the article. The environmental focus, and suggestion that seeing resources being used results in an appreciation of conservation, seem to me to be essentially modern views, and  I would argue are not reflected in typical Victorian perspectives. Nor do I think that the view on understanding technology is entirely accurate either: the typical Victorian, I would argue, would be unlikely to understand the cylinder process of glass pane production, for example, or methods used for metalwork, joinery, and the construction of much of what was around them. As other have pointed out, very few would know about the production of the resources they were consuming: I&#x27;d argue that people today have a much better understanding of those things, given our frequent societal discussions of them.<p>The idea that modern items are &quot;trash,&quot; too, and Victorian ones are far more reliable and usable, is perhaps unfortunate. Yes, there are problems with the reliability, longevity, and repairability of many modern items, but that&#x27;s a choice in purchasing: there are many modern items that are more reliable. The flexibility of my steel dip pen nibs may be impressive, and my early fountain pens beautiful, but my modern fountain pens are far more reliable and repairable, and modern ballpoint pens are simply so reliable as to hardly ever need repair. Tips of modern alloys last far longer and are far less fragile. Plastic is far sturdier and long-lasting than resin, and fine machining has allowed for far more repairable mechanisms. Watches are not too dissimilar: maintenance for 19th century watches often meant throwing out and replacing parts, which is one of the reasons why they are so difficult to repair today. Modern mechanical watches require far less maintenance, and good quality modern quartz watches require essentially none.<p>All of this ignores, of course, that in looking for original items today, the author and her husband are only obtaining things that were built well enough to have already lasted for over a century.<p>I also get the sense that the author has a dislike of the academic study of history. That&#x27;s unfortunate. Primary sources can help to explain an era, but can also mislead. They assume a certain perspective on the part of the reader. Contemporary writers often have difficultly seeing elements of their own culture, and even when they see them, often have their own agendas. Without studying a wide variety of primary sources and analysing them as a whole, it is difficult to come to accurate conclusions.<p>For example, I would argue that, in reading a large number of original dance manuals of the 19th century, one would develop a wildly inaccurate perspective on dancing in the 19th century. Dance manuals, perhaps like etiquette manuals, represented the ideal visions of individual dance instructors,  pushed complex dances and elegant forms requiring more instruction (for obvious reasons), and were often out-of-date. A preliminary statistical study I&#x27;m doing of 19th century dance cards suggests that the vast majority of group dances and round dance variations in dance manuals were hardly ever danced, if at all, outside of dance studios. Analysis of dance instructor commentary, newspaper reporting, letters, interviews, period works of fiction, and other sources also suggest that many people dancing did so very inexpertly, that by the mid-to-late 19th century quadrilles were very unpopular amongst trendier sets, and that dancers often danced in very energetic and rambunctious ways not at all reflected in dance manuals of the era except in their admonitions against doing so. If anything, in &quot;getting their own insights&quot; rather than also studying the era academically, I fear that they may be inadvertently reinforcing their own stereotypes, as reflected in their modern perspectives.<p>As for the difficulties in dealing with those around them, I have to admit I&#x27;m surprised that they would receive such reactions. Perhaps it because I live behind high walls, insulated from the world around me, or because I&#x27;m fortunate to live in a more tolerant area, or because I&#x27;m more private about my lifestyle, but I have walked down the street for decades in clothes not too dissimilar to theirs, and have never experienced any hostilityâ€”nor, I believe, have many of my friends. I don&#x27;t know why their experiences would be so different.<p>With all of that said, that they are able to live this life, and be happy living it, is wonderful. I think it gives, if not an accurate perspective on life in another era, then a different and useful perspective on life in our own.",1441848111

Psych research has had a checkered history, for sure, but this straw man doesn&#x27;t help the author&#x27;s case. How does this reflect on academic research standards?<p>For those who don&#x27;t know, modern research standards (i.e., the last 40 years) require all research to be approved by an Institutional Review Board, which is mostly staffed by non-psychologists. They have to justify the possible knowledge gained, the methodology used, and if there is any deception involved, all participants get a mandatory debriefing, where the purpose was explained to them. The research shows that debriefings are very effective, and the vast majority of participants do not leave the lab feeling violated; most are happy to contribute to scientific knowledge (or just collect their cash/course credit).<p>I have personally witnessed labs temporarily shut down for violating IRB rules. And without IRB approval, no legitimate journal will publish your research.<p>While Milgram and Asch&#x27;s experiments were deceptive, I think their results reveal harsh, necessary truths about ourselves. Zimbardo is a different case, in that the Prison experiment was methodologically unsound. It&#x27;s highly unlikely he&#x27;d get IRB approval today. CIA collaboration (like Gottlieb&#x27;s dosing unsuspecting civilians with LSD) existed entirely outside academic influence, and while shameful, don&#x27;t reflect academic standards. (Gottlieb wasn&#x27;t even a psychologist, he was a chemist.)<p>As for the very basic assumption under question, the difficulty is that many people will not act normally when they know what the researcher is looking for. Most people are decent, and will want to help the researcher. Some will react in the opposite way and seek to mess with the research. The most ethical way to compensate for temporary deception is a complete &quot;fessing up&quot; right after, and most participants agree.",1441847772

10195642,comment,10190006,10192680,0,0,wslh,,,"> it has simply been true that even as many tasks have been automated away, there have been multiplicatively more tasks that haven&#x27;t yet.<p>In part this is the denial I talked about. Many of the multiplicatively tasks we have are the result of not finding how to solve obvious problems with pragmatic solutions. Let me explain:<p>Everytime we came up with new programming environments and languages we repeat the same cycles. It is very rare to have a real breakthrough. For example, once NodeJS become popular we are happy when someone introduce libraries that already existed in another language instead of automating the production of these libraries. All this work can be reduced to some software to generate stuff for multiple languages. Surely you can&#x27;t apply this for different paradigms but there are few programming paradigms being used in production.<p>If you follow this approach you will only need a proportion of the people that is working now.<p>Another example: big corporations. I don&#x27;t talk about Google or Facebook, I talk about the typical big corporation. If you walk around you can find that replacing a lot of IT employees is relatively easy with good organization. In a way we are protecting our own work not thinking very hard about how to replace people.",1441847543

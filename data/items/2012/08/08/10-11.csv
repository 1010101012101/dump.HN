Then possibly remote-wipe all data belonging to whoever owns that account, data which may or may not be recoverable.<p>There is a <i>slight</i> difference. Apple has a much bigger responsibility here. Amazon is just responding because this is bad press, and they are basically covering Apple's ass here.<p>Apple, as per usual, has a shitty security record. Unless Microsoft, they haven't learned that security is a something which has to be baked in at the root of your products and services. It needs to be there from the start and isn't something which can be tacked on later.<p>For a short time, Apple was ahead of Microsoft in security because its OS was based on Unix-roots. Now they've built so many systems on top of that, and we can clearly see that Apple itself has no concept about security. Apart, ofcourse, for DRMed media and its own walled iOS-gardens.<p>The only security Apple cares about is its own. I wonder when their Microsoft-moment will come and they realize they have a responsibility towards their customers security wise as well.",1344423323

Microsoft licensed QDOS but didn't buy it outright, and later made a deal with DRI to cover its ass. Both the original developer of QDOS and DRI ended up with the rights to sell DOS products. (As did IBM.)<p>Years later, DRI was selling its own version of DOS (DR-DOS) which was widely considered technically superior to MS-DOS or PC-DOS (e.g. At one point it supported preemptive multitasking and could also run Windows 3.x iirc.)<p>The real ""theft"" was that when the original developer of QDOS went bankrupt, its mos valuable asset was its DOS license. But when it tried to sell it Microsoft sued and forced the owner to sell the license to Microsoft for a very low figure. Meanwhile, DR-DOS was killed using a combination of deliberate incompatibilities and eventually Windows 95.<p>I never used DR-DOS, but I remember greatly preferring PC-DOS to MS-DOS because the default text editor was so much nicer.<p>The fact the article makes zero mention of DR-DOS is a bit puzzling.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR-DOS</a>",1344423111

This encourages knee jerk reactions to anything where they think they have an area of expertise in (or just an opinion) and they use any forum possible to air how they think things <i>should</i> be done, or just what other people are doing wrong and why something will never work.<p>If you're frustrated about the general status quo, some people will become extremely vocal, and use language to stand out in the crowd and have their opinion be heard. Venting alone becomes therapeutic to them, because it's their way to contribute to the process.<p>...until they need to do it again in the next thread.",1344420706

But its nothing illegal in having imdbxxx.com - which btw is still available. I might be wrong but if this is the case - imdb (in this case) should make sure that they own all domains , which might be associated with their brand (like imdbapi.com for example).

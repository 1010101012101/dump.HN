There is no reason why Americans should need to pay over twice as much per capita to provide the same barely adequate health care for their employees!<p>Startups are even more vulnerable to high monthly startup costs than they are to lack of financing.  You can get by on credit cards working out of your garage, but not if you rent a large unit in an office park and not if you need to shell out hundreds per month per employee for health insurance.<p>Right now, college students are creating most startups.  That's not only because they know the newest technology.  They have no responsibility to pay for or protect a family.  The single greatest innovation that would prompt the formation of more mid-career American startups would be any reform that takes the cost of health insurance off of corporate balance sheets.  It seems most likely that would be some kind of ""Medicare-for-All"" system, though other innovations may be possible.",1297281199

I don't think they're leaps and bounds better and I think they should be.<p>I'm not one to constantly point to yesteryear and claim they were better but I do look at where they are today and think they should be further along than they are.<p>I guess when I look at certain segments of technology in 2000, some other companies have stayed more focused on their primary goal and have made phenomenal achievements since then. For example, OS X wasn't released to consumers until 2001 and the iPod didn't exist. Yet look where we are today. I have an iPhone in my pocket with incredible computing power, a very good refined interface, and a fantastic OS. Apple has stayed very focused on OS and consumer device design and pushed the field forward very far, with everyone else scrambling to catch up. This is their main business, and while they have other side projects (like the AppleTV) they stay focused on their main thing which is making great devices for consumers.<p>While Google, whose primary business was search+, now operates in many different business segments. Their focus has widened greatly and now they have email, payment processing, online document editing, 2 operating systems, automated cars, and the list goes on and on. Now, I have great love for many of these products and services so I do not suggest that it was a bad idea for them to do them, but I think it is apparent that search has suffered as a consequence.<p>Had Google stayed more focused on search instead of all these side businesses, search could be far more developed than it currently is today. I think they got complacent while being on top and tried to find other places to allocate their resources. Which, from a business perspective, I understand, but from a search perspective it seems tragic.<p>Therein lies my disappointment with Google, not that they haven't been innovating or improving search, they have. But they have spent so much time and resources on other things that search is not as far along as it should be.<p>+ Certainly it could be argued that their primary business is and always has been advertising and search is just one of the many vehicles for pushing said advertising, but the word Google is now synonymous with search and, marketing speak aside, I consider it their primary focus.",1297280696

I acquired a new partner, we rebuilt the application from the ground up and I’ve embraced the freemium model.

I’ve had success in the past as a startup founder, hit an equity event and have the luxury of pursuing this on my own terms.<p>I recognize that people look at our product and say “Oh, so you’re like Basecamp / Yammer / etc”—this is just where we landed. There are others doing what we are doing but we all have a slightly different take on it. I suffer no delusions of grandeur of becoming “Facebook for IT” or anything like that; I just want to have a product that solves a defined need that my partner and I are passionate about, acquire as many customers as I can to build a sustainable business and have a valuable service.<p>Other than general feedback on the site and/or product, I would love to hear some HN feedback on our freemium offering.

There are just different modes of failure that need to be considered.<p>In the case of software, you would start with a Hazard Analysis. Designs/code that have high hazard (failure may mean serious injury or death for example) get more scrutiny and better protection. A simple example might be you that have to make a complex calculation that could be catastrophic if it is buggy. That might be mitigated by breaking up the calculation into segments and error checking each segment (e.g., protection against divide by zero deep inside the equation if the wrong set of parameters are input), or by having an additional sanity check on the value that's about to be output to an actuator given current conditions. The point here is to acknowledge that an unseen defect may be lurking in the code, and to try to add protection against it.<p>There are also predictive techniques that a lot of groups use to estimate defect density. If you expect (based mainly on history) that there will be 1 defect/kLoC found in final test and the test team is only finding 0.1 or they're finding 10, then you need to go back and figure out if the estimates are wrong, the design is screwed up, or the testers are slacking off. In any case, the process should be adjusted.<p>I don't know when software development will get to the statistically predictable state of modern manufacturing, but it will happen eventually.

(It generally fails to define what it means, but I'm guessing they mean web sites given the reference to Apple telling developers to make HTML5 apps for things they won't let into the store. At least on iPhone, not-in-store equals not-an-app.)<p>Lower cost of development and lower cost of maintenance translate into more (and better) services for end users. It's unlikely that web apps are going to compete with ""sovereign"" apps on a phone like email or an RSS reader. But for a niche or transient application (like say, making a flight reservation or looking up your order status on a web site) the web apps probably are a better experience.<p>This has always been true on the desktop as well, until recently - you wanted a local email client and text editor, but you were fine using the web to access Wikipedia. (That's changing now, of course.) It's not sexy but _most_ web services / sites are transient, not sovereign, software and will likely translate better to a web app than a native app.",1297278779

9539383,comment,9535541,9536636,0,0,zxcvvcxz,,,"Since you&#x27;re saying it without saying it, let&#x27;s simplify and summarize:<p>> furthermore, society interprets &quot;men&quot; as the top (physically, socially, financially) 20% of men, the men who make a real dent in the world and who override the general perception of masculinity in society. the high achievers, the genetically gifted, the powerful. the stereotypical &#x27;man&#x27;.<p>I.e. Alpha males. Women are biologically programmed to go for them, and that&#x27;s a good thing for our society&#x27;s fitness.<p>> however, the truth is most men aren&#x27;t that archetype. most men are workhorse peons that get the shit end of the deal, having to endure living a modern subsistence lifestyle that consists of cheap housing, cheap food, cheap relationships, cheap labor.<p>I.e. Beta males. Sounds awful to be one right? But by definition they are the majority.<p>Now here&#x27;s where it gets interesting. The &quot;3 M&#x27;s&quot; as you mention, i.e. marriage, is a social construct used to incentivize Beta males to be productive. Marriage attempts to create an artificial 50/50 male/female pairing so that the vast majority of men have incentives to be productive and contribute towards society.<p>Societies which did not have this feature did not succeed throughout history.<p>Now we reach an interesting point in the 21st century, where by we have so much abundance that female needs are becoming <i>decoupled</i>. Note what I said above: females naturally seek the top of men, but society pressures them to consummate with average men to achieve 50/50. This deal was easier to sell in the past because women generally needed male providers to do the things they wanted: survive comfortably, start a family, etc.<p>Guess what? That is no longer so. Just read the original story: the now ex-wife has everything she needs, husband not included. His &quot;meaning of life&quot; was reduced to nothing. I&#x27;m not saying he&#x27;s a victim though: I believe everyone has the responsibility to examine the incentives for or against them, understand the nature of those they interact with, and act accordingly. Social conditioning prepared him for the life of clueless provider though, and that sure didn&#x27;t help him.<p>What women are encouraged to do now is roughly as follows. Chase those top X% Alpha men during their youth, when their beauty allows for it. Two options are possible: best case scenario, lock down the high value man. Fat chance though, with female sexual liberation, these men can just keep having an abundance of relationships with other young and pretty girls.<p>The other option is more common for women: hit about 30, coupled with a decline in beauty (which IMO is more linked to career stresses than the age) and then decide to &quot;settle down&quot; with a more provider type. Maybe he even has the &quot;dad bod&quot;. I figure that must be a good marker for women to look for around this time, so it makes sense they&#x27;d encourage it.<p>Imagine this for a second. You eat gourmet food for 10 years straight, and then suddenly you have to switch to microwave TV dinners. Would you feel a little resentment? Would you ever have cravings for your previous diet?<p>In summary, when it comes to happiness and relationships, it&#x27;s very important to understand the desires and incentives of others, as well as that of your environment. This is also the only way to minimize your exposure to tragedy.",1431529149

Purchase nice new things for baby and then dispose of them when you don&#x27;t need them. Expensive.\n2. Trawl charity shops, eBay, etc. for second-hand bargains. Time consuming.<p>This provides a third option that will ideally be between the two price-wise, and add extra convenience and assurance (promises to quality-check and sterilise everything before sending it back out) over DIY second-hand.

You can effectively self-insure with a risk pool of one person.  The money in the escrow account still earns interest.  Not only do the people who do that not pay premiums, which are lost, they can keep all their money, and even pay themselves a little extra, for not causing accidents.  But if they have one, no big deal.  They pay for the damage, then top up the escrow account.  Their premiums do not increase.<p>All you need to save money is to be rich.  So simple.  Everyone should do it, right?<p>That&#x27;s what the extreme frugality crowd does.  If you drastically reduce your living expenses, you can save more rapidly, and begin to take advantage of the lowered expense opportunities available to people with lots of savings, such as the incredibly simple elimination of all loan interest payment expenses.  And that allows you to save more.<p>And the calculations don&#x27;t care about how much you earn.  The only thing that matters is what proportion of your income you can save, and how much your savings can return in excess of inflation.<p>But you can&#x27;t just become rich by doing the things that rich people do.

Such a leader would seek out every metric available, right? But, as in the Allegory of the Cave [1], where people might become very skilled at interpreting shadows but never recognize the true Form of the hidden objects casting the shadows, metrics are only good when they convey the Truth... which, in the case of publication quality, may indeed be that justice is ill-served by journalistic pandering, and that metrics are inherently short-term.<p>Of course, Plato was also an advocate of censorship in the very same work [2], so any reading should be taken with a grain of salt.

It doesn&#x27;t matter how fast the GPU is at a computation if the time to transfer the data is longer than it would take to do the calculation on the host CPU.<p>I published a paper with this conclusion a while back (&quot;Evaluation of Streaming Aggregation on Parallel Hardware Architectures&quot;, <a href=""http://www.scott-a-s.com/files/debs2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scott-a-s.com/files/debs2010.pdf</a>). My paper was basically, &quot;GPUs are awful for our problem, so let&#x27;s compare to CPUs and Cell&quot;. A more recent paper from NSDI 2015 from a group at CMU, with Anuj Kalia as the first author, that also looks into it, &quot;Raising the Bar for Using GPUs in Software Packet Processing&quot;, <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/doc/nsdi15/gopt_nsdi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~akalia/doc/nsdi15/gopt_nsdi.pdf</a>. They look at just the GPU and CPU part of the spectrum - which is probably more relevant to most, as the Cell is a dead technology now. (I think my conclusions will matter more when on-chip GPUs become more prevalent, but we&#x27;re not there yet). Their paper starts with an excellent analysis of the latencies for transferring data to GPUs, and comparing end-to-end performance against several different algorithms, where they vary the amount of data reuse.<p>My consistent gripe when talking about improving application performance by using accelerators is that one must take data copying costs into consideration, which means we must use application end-to-end performance as our metric. There&#x27;s a temptation to focus on just the computational kernel performance. The Kalia et al. paper is the best treatment of this subject that I have seen.",1431528040

Meanwhile the reasonable pricing of the POWER8 chips should result in third party servers that are strongly competitive with the Xeon on a performance-per-dollar basis.<p>This was in conclusion to the E5-vs-Power8 comparison. For some reason they didn&#x27;t use E7, however this shouldn&#x27;t change the outcome, since according to [2] the E7 is basically the same chip with the same number of cores, just with a few more features enabled (4 and 8 socket systems possible and support for more memory). So AFAIK the E5 shouldn&#x27;t be looked at as a &quot;small&quot; version of the E7, since taken for itself in isolation for a given benchmark that doesn&#x27;t have extremely high memory demand, it should deliver the same performance. Whether you need an E7 or not should be decided in terms of the architecture you want to build, not the performance you aim for.<p>[1]<a href=""http://anandtech.com/show/9193/the-xeon-e78800-v3-review/7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anandtech.com/show/9193/the-xeon-e78800-v3-review/7</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://anandtech.com/show/9193/the-xeon-e78800-v3-review/3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anandtech.com/show/9193/the-xeon-e78800-v3-review/3</a>",1431527826

The point of feminism was to bring equality to the sexes.  In places where it has been successful, to see it continue to push forward as a way of achieving victories for women causes spite and backlash.  I have low hopes for a real men&#x27;s version of feminism to form, for exactly the reasons laid out in this article. The main problem (as this article points out) is that any man who admits to difficulties or problems is seen as not-a-man.  The current state of MRA might be sad, but they are generally despised first and foremost because men who complain are not respectable men.  Perhaps its just a pipe dream, but one would hope that feminists would remember that the original goal was equality for both sexes, and would help us out where needed.",1431527701

This little idea came to mind because there are [sadly] regular issues with developers pushing potential security flaws into production. No software is perfect and the larger the project is, the more security holes are likely to appear.<p>So I was thinking of building single factor, physically separated authentication services on the assumption that even if a security flaw occurs on the webserver [e.g. Sql injection or the server just gets outright hacked in some fashion] the authentication servers will be intact. Obviously, they&#x27;ll be able to attempt a brute force from the compromised webservers against the authentication nodes to attempt to guess password but I am figuring the odds of a very simple service having an easily exploited flaw if it sits physically separate from the webserver is worth the effort. Especially if I open source the services and get some people to look at them.\nGeneral user data is still stored in the web application (e.g. everything but the email/password/otp)<p>Retains the Salt as each user will have a unique salt [for password hash, etc] and it&#x27;ll be used to identify the user to the other services.<p><i>Emails are stored separately as they are an authentication factor and used in account recovery:</i><p>GET service/:salt/:email [pass/fail if email exists] POST service/:salt/:email [upserts a new hash/email combination]<p><i>Passwords are to be stored in a separate database cluster which responds to a very simple service:</i><p>GET service/:salt/:password [pass/fail if combination exists] POST service/:salt/:password [upserts a new hash/otp combination]<p><i>2nd Factor Authentication [ OTP ] will function similarly but stored in a separate database cluster.</i><p>GET service/:salt/:otp [pass/fail if combination exists] POST service/:salt/:otp [upserts a new hash/otp combination]",1431527548

Airport codes are popular to distinguish datacenters.<p>As far as encoded name schemes go, and even with the cattle method, I like the physical/virtual distinction.

You can, of course, read the whole article yourself to form your own opinion. The article is organized as a pro-con debate (with the &quot;con&quot; side first) on whether the broad classes of medicines prescribed for psychiatric conditions (mostly mood disorders and schizophrenia) are helpful or not.<p>The writer who says that the drugs&#x27; &quot;benefits would need to be colossal to justify [patient deaths associated with their use], but they are minimal&quot; is Peter C Gøtzsche, a professor at the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Copenhagen. I would ordinarily expect someone with an affiliation with the Cochrane centers to have an evidence-based perspective on evaluating treatments for human disease, and I think he makes some good criticisms of study designs about drug effectiveness for treating psychiatric disorders.<p>The writers who say that &quot;Psychiatric drugs are as beneficial as other treatments used for common, complex medical conditions. Leucht and colleagues reviewed the efficacy of psychiatric and general medicine drugs by analysing meta-analyses: they found that psychiatric drugs were generally as efficacious as other drugs&quot; are Allan H Young, professor of mood disorders at King’s College London and John Crace, psychiatric patient and a writer for The Guardian. They in turn make several thoughtful criticisms of the studies Gøtzsche relies on to infer harm. My personal impression is that they have the better of the argument, because the conditions treated with the drugs mentioned in this article are themselves fatal, and if left untreated greatly increase patient mortality.<p>I think everyone who follows this research closely (as I do, as part of my journal club participation with researchers on human behavior genetics) has settled on the conclusion that patients are genetically diverse even if they have the same diagnosis, and therefore a drug that works for one patient may not work for another. But a drug that works for an immediate family member of the patient probably will work for the patient, and &quot;talk therapy&quot; of a kind proven to be safe and effective is an important both-and to add to treatment of major psychiatric disorders. Patients with major psychiatric disorders ARE living longer and enjoying better day-by-day functioning than ever before in my lifetime, so the statistics trump the anecdotes in showing that something about current treatment is working to help patients.",1431525803

The portrayal of the US on the news is so out of whack with reality that it&#x27;s really kind of depressing. Reporting bad news out of the US seems to be a hobby of the world&#x27;s media, as does misreporting our politics and social issues.<p>I&#x27;ve worked for foreign companies whose workers would come over for 6-12 months and would enjoy themselves here greatly. Plus, like any tech worker, I work with a lot of H1Bs and first generation immigrants who have very little negative to say about the US and are also quite happy with things. Anecdotal, I know, but so is what you&#x27;re reading here and seeing in your media.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m biased (obviously), and have probably written more than anyone cared to read, but I&#x27;d still recommend visiting someday. Avoid the urban centers (they don&#x27;t differ much) and visit our national parks. Places like Yosemite [0] and the Grand Canyon [1] are breathtaking. For some of my former colleagues, just visiting places like Idaho or Utah, where they could be miles and miles away from the nearest person, was enjoyable, as that was something they could never experience back home (and those states are beautiful as well). And if you want to be really alone, visit Alaska.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm</a>",1431525666

They go to OEMs and shake them down for a small licensing deal clouded in other deals and agreements, and also promises to make or keep making Windows Phones etc. Their goal is never court cases except in cases like BN (which they quickly settled later). The strategy is to build up precedents and take small amounts instead of full blown lawsuits requesting $30/device.

Rails makes it very easy to write thoughtful, elegant code. But that's not to say that it's impossible or even difficult to do with CodeIgniter.<p>You can extend CodeIgniter's core classes very easily to provide a lot of the same magic you'll find in Rails. There are a lot of ORMs similar to ActiveRecord available, and a great MongoDB library written by Alex Bilbie (<a href=""https://github.com/alexbilbie/codeigniter-mongodb-library"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexbilbie/codeigniter-mongodb-library</a>). I've created a  popular open source library that enables you to autoload views into layouts like in Rails (<a href=""https://github.com/jamierumbelow/codeigniter-base-controller"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jamierumbelow/codeigniter-base-controller</a>).<p>You can implement RESTful URLs simply and efficiently by customising the <i>routes.php</i> file yourself, or by using a route generation engine such as Pigeon (<a href=""https://github.com/jamierumbelow/pigeon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jamierumbelow/pigeon</a>).

But the same is true for Python/Django, the same is true for functional programming languages such as Clojure and the same is true for Objective-C and the iPhone SDK.<p>CodeIgniter is incredibly flexible and that's probably exactly why you use it. Taking a bit of time to interact with the community and see what gems are out there will let you write much better CI code, and a lot of the time you'll find you don't need or want Rails.<p>DISCLAIMER: I have written a book about writing better and more Rails-y code with CodeIgniter called The CodeIgniter Handbook (<a href=""https://efendibooks.com/codeigniter-handbook/vol-1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://efendibooks.com/codeigniter-handbook/vol-1</a>).",1346521549

I don't think you'd find anyone more convincing about the practicality and need of calculating vectors in three dimensions than someone who was plotting missile trajectories for a living. He had great practical examples for the calculus principles being taught.<p>Understandably every student, myself included, always wanted to know more about his previous career before teaching us calculus since it's not every day you meet an astronaut, and you're a little star-struck (no pun intended) when you've got such direct access to the guy. So to prevent distracting, time consuming and calculus-irrelevant questions during classes he'd set up an Q&A session one night each semester outside class and settle the curiosities. You could kind of tell he didn't really enjoy it, but felt obligated to do it because astronauts are public figures and kind of have to oblige the public a bit, and because it was better than his classes being distracted by it all semester.<p>The one thing that he said that stuck with me was that since it had been >10 years since he had been with NASA was that his memory of his tasks in space have been blurred from having retold the stories so many times. The actions and the stories have become separate in his mind.",1346521528

You are writing dishonest propaganda.</i><p>Neither is knee-jerk reaction knowledge. Also, ""propaganda"" really? For which side, since I acknowledge the wrong-doings of all of them?<p>20+ pogroms, you say. What does that say in itself? Not much.<p>You have to measure the importance of those numbers, and put them in historical perspective.<p>Else, with the same ""muslims in the 19th century were as bad as christian nations in treating jews, because they had 20+ pogroms"" you could as easily come to the conclusion that the US is an antisemitic haven, what with: ""From 1979 to 1989 the ADL recorded more than 9,617 anti-Semitic incidents, including 6,400 cases of vandalism, bombings and attempted bombings, arsons and attempted arsons, and cemetery desecrations. The tally peaked at 2,066 in 1994"".<p>So, let's try QUALITATIVE inquiry, instead of mere numbers. Those 20+ pogroms, how severe where they and how long have they persisted? Were only muslim communities in those multi-cultural cities involved? How do they compare to the situation in Europe and Russia, that had HUNDREDS of pogroms for several centuries, some of very large scale, including the persecution of jews in Russia and the USSR and culminating in the Nazi's genocide?<p>Read more about the Damascus Affair:<p><i>>The Damascus affair occurred in 1840, when a French monk and his servant disappeared in Damascus. Immediately following, a charge of ritual murder was brought against a large number of Jews in the city including children who were tortured. The consuls of England, France and Germany as well as Ottoman authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.</i><p>Do you see it being especially about muslim persecution? Jewish scholars and writers themselves write that for many centuries jews had it better in muslim countries than they did in Europe. E.g up until in the first part of 20th Century hundreds of thousands of Jews lived in Salonica in peace under ottoman muslim rule (they even called the place ""mother of Israel"").<p>Yes, you can find persecution in several cases. That doesn't mean it is at the same level as persecution of jews that was done by christians and christian countries.<p>><i>But maybe they learned that from the Swedes?! :-)</i><p>Why not? Sweden was a Nazi Germany ally. That Wikipedia calls their stance ""neutrality"" is beyond comprehension. Here's how they put it:<p>""Sweden maintained a position of neutrality during the second world war; as such, it acted as a major supplier of raw materials for Hitler's military, laundered the gold confiscated from Holocaust victims, and often failed to provide adequate asylum for refugees including the near-completely exterminated Norwegian Jews. Some Swedes even volunteered with the Waffen SS.""<p>In general, Sweden has a long and convoluted history with the matter (heck, they even had an active eugenics program up until the seventies).<p>><i>Bye, I can't take you seriously when I have to quote every damn word of wikipedia pages or you deny the content (well, you deny the content even when I quote it...)</i><p>Please don't take Wikipedia as the Bible. Some of the stuff it has is neutralised to not offend anyone, and lacks substance. Other articles contain just the bare facts and numbers, and need interpretation (to be put into perspective) to make any sense.<p>Especially matters of history that involve politics is not the best domain for Wikipedia. It's far better as a reference for technical and pop culture issues.",1346520515

Best place to search (fastest, most relevant, most results), best place to research (data insight, recommendations), and the best place to shop (metasearch engine, finds lower prices from more sources worldwide).<p>Travel is a big market and there hasn't been much innovation in the last ten years.  We were founded on the belief that consumers deserve to get transparency and a fair deal and we believe that tackling hotel search is a great way to help travelers make more informed decisions and save some moolah.  It's not the sexiest space to be in but the travel space is the 2nd largest commerce category and we think we can own a piece of the pie through a better product.<p>Our engineering team is 15+ and growing and we're hungry for more talent because we've got big problems to solve. We look for people who work comfortably across the entire stack.  We run on Ubuntu, AWS and no specific language knowledge is necessary though we use a lot of C++, PHP, and Javascript.  We don't believe in micromanagement so you'll need to be someone who is self-motivated, not scared off by things you've never done, and willing to make mistakes and know when to ask for a helping hand.  Most of our engineering comes from Google, Facebook, Yandex and other top tier companies as well as top tier schools.<p>On the marketing side, we need some firepower to get the word out there and build smart ways to analyze and optimize the paid traffic we're getting.  If you think it would be fun to compete in SEM against larger, more well-funded companies and you don't find it at all scary, we want to talk to you.  If you've done large scale email program build outs (things like automated price alerts, segmentation), we want to talk to you.<p>What's it like working at Room 77?<p>We're located a stone throws away from Red Rock Coffee in the heart of Downtown Mountain View.  We're a diverse bunch and we like to do a lot of team events.  Lunches are catered and we have a keg on tap, standard valley benefits apply including equity and competitive compensation.  You also get a travel stipend and a travel agent card to get massive savings when you take some R&R.<p>Who believes in us?<p>We've raised $13 million to date from VCs like General Catalyst, PAR, and Sutter Hill and companies like Concur (TripIt).  We're lucky to have both angels and advisers that have started companies like Expedia, MTV, HotelTonight, Nor1, and Zillow.  We're well connected to the industry so you don't have to worry about us having to bang on doors to get to the right folks, all we need to focus on is building a killer product that makes people fall in love with us.<p>If you think this sounds interesting or you just want us to buy you a coffee when you're in Mountain View, reach out to us.

Google employees have access to source of binaries you don't have access to. If you happen to have the binaries of an unreleased version of Android, you are entitled to the source. At least, all of the parts that are under GPL licenses. Google may or may not release sources for other versions.<p>> But there is a process for getting commit privileges that doesn't involve job interviews.<p>Being able to contribute to the upstream is not what defines free software. Being able to fork released software and work on it is. Android passes this test. Also, accepting patches from third parties could open Android to all sorts of litigation. What if a former Microsoft employee contributes leap year handling code from their products? The fact Android phones will crash on every February 29th will be the least of Google's problems.<p>> That gives me source for old, outdated versions of Android<p>No. It gives you access to the sources of the Android versions publicly available.

At the IPO share price of $38, the value of the total outstanding shares was around $100B, giving them a P/E ratio of 100 ($100B / $1B = 100). Now that the share price has fallen by half, the P/E ratio is closer to 50.<p>The P/E ratio is used to give an indication of how highly a company's stock is valued in relation to the profit they make. Companies with a high P/E ratio are typically expected by shareholders to report higher profits in the future. Those with a low ratio are expected to remain flat or contract. For high-growth companies, like triple-digit growth, a P/E ratio between 50-100 is not unheard of, but is relatively high, and an indication of an exceptionally high degree of confidence in the company. A ratio in the 20-40 range is more common for growing companies. 10 and under typically indicates a relative lack of faith in growth prospects by investors.<p>There are many more factors to consider than relation to last year's profits when determining the value of a stock, but this is a very commonly used metric.",1346518941

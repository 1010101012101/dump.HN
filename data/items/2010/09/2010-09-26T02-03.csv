1728412,comment,1727938,1728380,0,0,jrockway,,,"Rape and murder are violent crimes.  Smacking someone causes them minor pain that subsides within seconds.  It's something you shouldn't do, but it's not <i>violent</i>.  Talking about it in an abstract sense is not something that is particularly shameful.<p>Using this action as a literary device is not offensive.  Saying ""I want to smack someone"" acts to convey a desire to show someone that their actions are wrong, like a parent reprimanding a child for finger-painting all over the walls.<p>Honestly, in this situation, I find it appropriate.  ""I think using the suffix -gate to describe a scandal is silly"" doesn't have the same emotional and visceral effect as ""I want to smack these guys"", even though the OP probably means the former.<p>Writing is about conveying emotion just as much as conveying literal facts and desires.",1285469938

It’s not surprising that the White House has a telephone number, it’s surprising that the call was answered.<p>Reaching something that is merely a few hundred miles away with no obstacles blocking the signal doesn’t seem very challenging to me. The problem has to be the speed with which the ISS is moving across the sky which doesn’t give you very much time to make contact.<p>Much more interesting, however, would be why the hell the ISS is listening and responding.",1285469938

Also, the person placing the order <i>can turn it off</i>.<p>Second, the motives in your hypothetical don't make sense. Direct Edge is the venue allowing flash orders. ARCA gets two commissions, but DE gets nothing. Why would DE want to give commissions to their competitors? And if this happened to any significant degree, why would customers continue to set their ""please flash me"" flag to True?<p>Lastly, front running based on flash trading is illegal, not to mention pretty easy to prove in court. And it's pretty easy to find people doing it based solely on an electronic search of the tapes. If it happened to any significant degree, how come the SEC didn't find it?",1285469935

My mind just lost interest (it is almost 4am mind you) and I closed the tab.<p>Then it occurred to me that this arithmetic would be much easier if I had built up to it, i.e. I was used to doing sums like that.<p>So, with that in mind, perhaps you need to offer more? I mean, a lot more. Ways to track my progress as I do build up, ways to give me good places to push the boundaries of my mental arithmetic. I mean, you could go on extending it and making more useful. You could dig out research for the best way to get the user to learn.<p>I'm thinking along the lines of the ""goal"" to be able to perform sums like those Japanese students who use abacuses to solve massive sums very quickly even once the abacus is removed.<p>There are plenty of interesting features you could add to it!

1728404,comment,1728220,1728366,0,0,whopa,,,"Out of the 3 pursuits you mentioned explicitly, I think only one of them actually truly benefits from the education system: medicine. With finance, the fundamentals are easily learned by self study, and to excel really depends more on personality type and drive than stuff that's taught in school. Law you can absolutely self study, there's plenty who've passed the bar exam without a degree in the past, though it's harder these days now that a lot of bar associations require a degree before you can sit for the test. That's likely due to favors to law schools rather than any real qualification reason.<p>Some other fields do certainly benefit from the resources a university provide though. With many engineering and science subjects, lab work is pretty key to understanding, and you're not going to have to resources to do that on your own general. Computer science is an exception here, since computers are pretty readily available.<p>However, with the rise of grade inflation and the general dumbing down of university curricula, for a lot of subjects your average school just doesn't confer much actual value.",1285469583

  Increase contrast 10%
  Resize to 400 by 600

I'm pretty sure that language based interaction for photo-editing would increase productivity by huge amounts.<p>The other thing is that we've somehow locked onto the idea that the computer should be able to understand everything immediately or else it's not even worth it.  But in the real world human's constantly miscommunicate, and we solve that problem very simply: ask more questions.  So if the user says something like:<p><pre><code>  Adjust contrast by 10%

1728388,comment,1728220,1728220,0,0,rblion,,,"Not everyone is meant to learn within four walls and from dispassionate, jaded professors. In my view, the best way to learn about life and how to survive using your skills and talents is 'in the wild' or by autodidacticism aka 'learning by experimentation by day and reading classics by night'. Just be prepared for a lot of initial rejection and to have enough conviction to walk to Mordor in your bare feet. It will take a lot more effort but it will make you much greater in the end.<p>I am 20. I dropped out a semester before I was to transfer to Georgia Tech. I dropped out because I know the surest path to greatness is autodidacticism. It's the way da Vinci, Lincoln, Einstein, and Jobs/Wozniack did it. Being a bit more rebellious and more curious than most, it's the only method of learning that I have ever excelled with anyways. I taught myself to read and write at 3 watching Disney movies with captions. I have been reading a book a week since 5th grade. My dad got me into web design and development while I was in middle school. By the end of high school, I was already feeling jaded with our Industrial Age school system and decided to learn of the Cosmos by direct experience...<p>HOW I GOT A WORLD CLASS EDUCATION FOR FREE:<p>1. ) I worked for my older brother's bootstrapped startup (Myriann.com). I watched him build websites from scratch, close big deals while still in college, and manage a team of designers and developers from all over the world. He is profitable and on pace to retire within a few years (if he wanted).<p>2.) I took advantage of iTunes U, TED, my public library, and free lectures from MIT, Stanford, and Harvard. I read world classics, epic biographies, and all branches of science. I discovered myself by going deeper into all subjects to the root of where each came from and why each exists. I now have a deep passion to be an artist and a scientist for the rest of my life. I will remain a student the rest of my life and apply everything I learn to my work...<p>3.) MY WORK: I am building a startup by trial and error. I have attempted to launch a startup 7 times since I was 15. All of them have had little success or went up in flames. I learned from each attempt and kept asking, thinking, and creating. I am now on attempt #8 and will try to enter YC this fall. I have never applied before.<p>DON'T LET YOUR VOICE BE DROWNED BY DOGMA!!!!!!",1285468850

1728386,comment,1726947,1728014,0,0,beagle3,,,"> You're drastically overstating the costs. I can put a server at the Nasdaq data center using Lightspeed Trading as my broker for $1,000.<p>Prices have dropped then. When NASDAQ bought INET, my payment came up for $400/month to $6000/month without any change in the service I was receiving (and it did come with onerous reporting requirements that I didn't factor into the $6000 above). I've been out of the game for a while.
(But these $6000 was just payment to nasdaq -- hosting and comm line to my office was a few grands more; and that's just NASDAQ. each of the other exchanges had similar costs)<p>> Go read about why many of the high-frequency firms pulled out of the market. They pulled out because the exchange's data feeds themselves were starting to fall behind. Their data was suspect, just as was everyone elses. If your data feed is lagged 4 times out of the last 6 months then you might want to go look at DTN's NxCore product. It doesn't lag and it's costs are quite reasonable for anyone who might need data at that level of fidelity.<p>I have actually been out of the game myself recently, so I didn't actually experience the flash crash. But friends still in the industry told me that the ITCH feeds (and the other exchange direct high-speed feeds) weren't lagging, only the CQS and NBBO feeds were.<p>The point is, if you don't have the ITCH/ARCABOOK/MDP/EBS data today, you are already at a disadvantage. 10 years ago, a $1500/month Bloomberg or Reuters terminal gave you the same info as everyone else. Today, if you're looking at multiple markets, you need to spend $50000/month to not be disadvantages. Those are real numbers as of a few years ago. I'm surprised prices have dropped, because they were constantly going up all the time.<p>> Where? Please cite a specific exchange and point me to the specific order type in their documentation. I've read the specs of nearly every major futures and equities liquidity venue in the US, so I doubt this is a true statement.<p>Flashes are done by brokers, not by exchanges!<p>A broker gets your order; they are allowed 1 full second before they must fill it at the NBBO at that time. EXCHANGE ORDERS ARE NEVER FLASHED.<p>at time 0ms, you send a ""BUY 100 INTL, LIMIT 110.13"" to your broker. The broker must fill that at the NBBO if possible at 1000ms at the latest. So at 1ms, they say to all their ""flash"" partners ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO FILL 100 INTL AT 110.13 OR LOWER?"". Now, theoretically, those partners should just check their own book and reply. But practically, these partners also rush out to buy 110.13 at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (where the NBBO is), so now the NBBO is no longer at 110.13. They do offer to sell it at 110.14 on ARCA. But at 1000ms (1 second later), the original client order which WOULD have been filled if the broker just went to PSE and NOT flashed it, CANNOT BE FILLED.<p>What the average client will do is probably say, ""well, ok then -- I want Intel at 110.14"". The broker now flashes this order, and our flashee guy from earlier is happy to fill the order -- locking a profit of 0.01 with essentially zero risk.
And if the client doesn't come back for 110.14? They'll just update the ARCA order to be 110.13; They're almost guaranteed to sell it to the same guy.<p>So, with some (small in practice) probability, the flashee pays a small commission; with large probability, they get free profit minus a small commission.<p>> Wrong, the purpose is to provide incentive for participants to trade at a specific exchange by giving them an opportunity to trade before the broader market does. For this they must improve the NBBO to match the flashed order.<p>That's theory. Practice of flashing is different. Note that exchanges DON'T wait this whole flashing second -- they either fill it locally immediately or route it to the NBBO. But brokers are allowed to do it.",1285468774

Facebook did not start with the goal of toppling MySpace.  Microsoft did not start with the goal of running on 95% of machines.  Twitter did not start with the thought of becoming a billion dollar company.  These companies get their through consistent cycles of ambition and execution.  There's nothing particular about a ""lifestyle"" business other than that the ambition has waned.  There's literally no business that exists that can not have ambitions and grow into a major corporation through a series of growth cycles.  Likewise, there's no business plan for a billion dollar company that someone can draw up from day 1 and have it survive the market on its way to that size.<p>As for education, <i>that's</i> the qualification for knowing how to run a business?

My advice to anybody in college with a project as successful as Facebook was at the time Zuckerberg dropped out is, ""yes, you should drop out too.  You won't be the next Zuckerberg (that ship has sailed), but you'll likely meet with some success in the valley, and certainly you'll learn more about running a real business than you were going to finishing out school.""",1285468397

I attend medical school currently, and am certain that the value I gain from the plethora of resources available, from discussing cases with professors to sticking my hands in a cadaver, is significantly more than that I'd get out of watching a few videos online, or taking some dissection tutorial. And these resources aren't free.",1285467839

But some of the players they flash to will go and BUY the NBBO within that second. So when ETrade, after not having able to improve your price, goes to the NBBO, they found they can no longer fill at the price that was available just a second ago. That's unfair advantage for the flasher -- a second ago, the ask was at 10.02 and bid was 10.01, which means the fair price is somewhere in between, but definitely not more than 10.02; Now, the flasher knows there's a buyer at 10.02 -- so they buy it themselves at 10.02 and offer to sell at 10.03; In many cases, the buyer will still want to buy, making the flasher a profit of 0.01; In the worst case, the flasher can offer it again at 10.02, paying only commission on his failed trade, and is likely to sell to the same buyer.<p>I know of institutions who actually made money that way, lots of it, with ridiculously low risk. And it's legal, because the broker is allowed to flash the order to anyone they want for one second before going to the NBBO, and the flasher has no commitment not to abuse that.<p>> Go read about the national market system.

1728348,comment,1727286,1728261,0,0,jewbacca,,,"I agree that it would be degrading to market a college based on this, but I'd also imagine that in an environment with a severe gender imbalance there would be people of the over-represented gender (of either gender) who would welcome the idea of a greater pool of potential partners in that environment (perhaps not enough to be willing to be ""sold"", as you've said).<p><pre><code>  > doubling the women/men ratio won't come close to doubling any particular guy's chances of having sex
</code></pre>
While doubling the women/men ratio won't necessarily double any particular guy's chances of having sex, it will certainly increase it, and I'm certain you're familiar with the lengths people of either gender will go to to increase their chances of ending up in their ideal mating situation (straightforward sex or otherwise) by even a vanishingly or imaginarily tiny amount.  And a favorable gender ratio won't effect a player's chances of having sex all that much, but for an average or socially-stunted guy, it will certainly increase his chances.<p>For one thing, a greater proportion of his interactions will be with women, increasing his chances by raw bayesian exposure, as well as by the greater socialization to women he will accrue.  I do not reject the stereotype we all know, of guys who spend too much of their lives in environments with the opposite gender imbalance, as applicable in a large minority of cases; though I would be interested in hearing your experience and reasoning if you disagree.<p>As well, as rare in this environment, these men will be more individually valuable to women seeking male partners than they would otherwise be (for whatever benefits of a mating/partnership would apply to the people involved, and could be categorized as valuable).  I don't think this concept of ""value"" would have as much of an effect on the difference in the situation as the 1st reason, but it would exist.  The degree to which it would be multiplied from what it would be in a gender-neutral environment would still be dependent on each individual, and a clueless total loss would probably still not get laid or dated or tied-up and pooed on or whatever they're looking for, but it would absolutely make each more appealing to some degree.  And (if you are willing to grant that confidence is sexy in many cases), any experience which increases a person's experience in and competence with sex and relationships feeds back on itself, and increases the likelihood of more experience.<p>So I think it would be pretty reasonable for most people to prefer a gender environment which is favourable to them.  Of course, your expectation of the quality of an institution that would directly market itself based on this, and of the quality of the character of the people for whom this was not sufficiently distasteful to turn them away, might offset the benefits of the advertised gender environment.  But having been an 18-year-old male and having known 18-year-old males, I do not think this is sufficient to nullify the appeal; and were this imbalance just known and not pimped, it would not be an entirely trivial factor in someone's choice of university.<p><pre><code>  NB: Pronoun ""his"" used for readability's sake, though if you'd judge what I've described to be equally applicable to women who are attracted to men in the reciprocal environment, substitute the gender-neutral pronoun of your choice.  I also initially included gay women with the men above, but I suppose the dynamic is totally different for them -- the people you're attracted to are also your potential competition.

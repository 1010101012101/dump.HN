7511629,comment,7509139,7511229,4,0,Zigurd,,,"Your Fragment subclasses is where your code that interacts with the user should be (the code that used to be in your Activity subclasses). Activity should contain Fragment objects by means of loading a layout.<p>The cool thing about Fragment is that you can organize your Fragment subclasses using different layout files, and you can organize the layout files using resource qualifiers. That means that Android is picking your layouts, and the number and layout of Fragment objects on a particular screen geometry, for you, instead of you having to write code that groks screen size, density, and text size.<p>I dislike navigation drawers almost as much as I disliked the now deprecated &quot;dashboards.&quot; It is a place where you can do nothing but go some other place. If you have that big an app, I suppose it&#x27;s OK. But making navigation a natural part of, say, picking an item from a list, or picking a menu item is preferable. Nav drawers look better than dashboards, but if you consider them from the user interaction PoV, they are the same.<p>Yes to using Bundle objects to move data. That&#x27;s how sending data to a Fragment is independent of whether it is in the same Activity or not.",1396385973

Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:<p>1st class engineer <p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura & Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs & databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality<p>Data hungry <p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.<p>Open all hours <p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>Solver of riddles <p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.<p>Getting shit done <p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.<p>Commercially aware <p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.<p>Keen eye, tuned ear <p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.<p>Security and speed <p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.<p>About We Are Base<p>We&#x27;re a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.<p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.<p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are rare by design.<p><a href=""http://wearebase.com/hiring"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wearebase.com/hiring</a>",1396385488
7511569,comment,7510659,7511452,4,0,mcherm,,,"> meanwhile bank execs are dropped off at work by private guards specializing in counter-kidnapping operations<p>Perhaps there are some bank executives for which this is true, but it is absolutely NOT the case for all banking executives. I work with some bank executives and they drive themselves to work in their own cars. The buildings DO have alarm systems and it is quite possible for the FBI to respond to physical threat incidents (because it is treated as a bank robbery) but otherwise there is little that is special in the way of physical security.<p>And for Coinbase, I believe the lack of special physical guards is appropriate. A high percentage (&quot;up to 97%&quot; according to <a href=""https://coinbase.com/security"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coinbase.com/security</a> ) of their coins are in cold storage and while I am not privy to the details of Coinbase&#x27;s arrangements, keysharing and multiple physical storage locations that are off-premises are a reasonable precaution. They are vulnerable to hostage-taking or &quot;3 thugs with guns&quot; to the exact same extent (no greater) as any other company with a similar amount of protection.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on protection against hardware keyloggers: it&#x27;s a threat that they need to be prepared for.

Engineers were often given their own watered-down type of classes (some schools give them different numbers, others don&#x27;t) - this was also true where I went to graduate school (which is a top 5 engineering school overall, sometimes ranked #1), the pure version of the classes, even calculus, were more rigorous than the engineering versions of the same - some of the engineers were aware of this, and some of the sharper ones opted instead for the versions of the classes geared towards the respective majors.  I have taught both these types of classes as a TA for math & physics, and tutored for the same & am thus better qualified to speak of the differences quite frankly.<p>Companies that hire pure talent often have went after top math & physics types, especially Wall Street - that&#x27;s no secret, and this has been true for decades.  They are extremely marketable degrees, and attractive to any company when combined with domain knowledge in other fields - to give some examples of some of the things that some of my peers are doing who possess those degrees, they include public policy, programming, data science, statistics, academia, teaching, economics, patent law, and finance.  The versatility is what is valuable, not necessarily the domain knowledge of math or physics itself, although that could be helpful too (i.e. the NSA, the largest employer of mathematicians, who often train them as programmers afterwards).<p>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are usually amongst the top degrees to have in various charts, and related careers to those skills are similarly rated very high (e.g. statistician being #2).  Engineering (most notably computer science) has had a surge as of the past decade due to the talent crunch and surge in innovation in software, but at the top, many companies still are very interested in more traditional candidates who show initiative since you can teach someone many things if the person is well grounded in fundamentals, but you cannot necessarily do the reverse as easily.",1396385057

The hard part is getting everyone to do something specific and profitable.  The reason why startups fail is usually because not enough real people wanted to spend enough real money on the product to pay the team members as much as they could earn doing something else.  If you try to assign blame for that, it might not even land on the same continent.<p>NASA only needs great management to stay on time and under budget.  With no basis for comparison, no one can say for certain whether any particular feat of engineering prowess was fast or slow, cheap or expensive.

7511453,comment,7510588,7510588,15,0,goldfeld,,,"This is beyond my wildest wishes. Meaning I have wished, as a formerly active Vim plugin author now fully switched over to Emacs/evil, exactly for Clojure compiling down to VimL so that I could maintain my plugins as Clojure/Lisp code, compiling it to actual VimL for public consumption, as a preprocessor. I&#x27;d think that would mostly do away with runtime performance worries, and not require the plugin user to actually have TimL installed as a plugin. Which means it could ease the transition of plugin authors to TimL, until eventually it&#x27;s ok (and perhaps performant) to have it as a runtime.<p>Needless to say, I love the fact that Tim Pope has hopped on the Clojure bandwagon, that the community can enjoy well thought out tooling such as he did/does for Rails.<p>That said, tpope is one of only a few driving forces over on the Vim side of Clojure, whereas most seem to flock to Emacs. So I see this as potentially a great opportunity to eventually have Clojure-ish compiling/running on both Vim and Emacs, so that plugin authors can literally write and keep a single codebase that maps into the respective editor APIs. Well, least common denominator I guess, with extras specific for each editor. And maybe, speaking from my experience developing Vim plugins and looking into Elisp code, we will need &#x27;clojureditor&#x27; packages providing higher level functionality painstakingly implemented for both editors, since it would be plenty non-trivial code that probably doesn&#x27;t belong in a core like TimL neither in a Clojure+elisp equivalent.<p>Then you could see this actually taking off big time since the more voluminous Clojure+Emacs community would be writing a good deal of plugins which would also work on Vim for free (imagine that!), so that they could support both platforms because it wouldn&#x27;t be much extra effort. Hats off to the Pope for actually taking on the arguably tougher half, since Elisp should hopefully be an easier target for a lisp like Clojure.",1396384275

7511349,comment,7500790,7502694,1,0,jpgoldberg,,,"[Disclosure: I work for AgileBits, the makers of 1Password]<p>The Agile Keychain Format was designed in 2007, and, indeed, it lacks both integrity checks and it leaves sensitive information like URL and Title unencrypted. The newer format (first released in December 2012) uses authenticated encryption and keeps Location and Title (and must other data) fully encrypted.<p>As others have noted, the Agile Keychain is still in use. We are being very cautious in rolling out the new data format, as we need compatibility across all of the platforms we support. There is, as on most things, a document about this:  <a href=""http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Security/rollout.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learn.agilebits.com/1Password4/Security/rollout.html</a><p>The rationale for the original design in the Agile Keychain Format is that the 1Password browser extension needs to be able to find which items match a particular website without having to decrypt everything in the database. Likewise, we&#x27;d like to be able to sort and provide an index of items without decrypting everything. The less we have decrypted at any one time the better.<p>The way we have solved this in 1Password 4 is to separate item information into &quot;overview&quot; and &quot;details&quot;. The &quot;overview&quot; data is all encrypted with a common overview key. But the details of each item is encrypted with an individual item key, which in turn is encrypted with a master key.<p>By the way, 1Password has always documented what is and isn&#x27;t encrypted. And we have shied away merely obfuscating unencrypted data. I will not speak directly about how other products handle the situation, but note that any password manager that integrates with the web browser faces a similar dilemma and have their own approaches.<p>At the risk of sounding whiney, I sometimes feel that we are taking more heat merely because we are more upfront about our design.",1396383319

7511339,comment,7510435,7510817,34,0,tptacek,,,"You need to be a little careful with these rankings, because they&#x27;re subjective. Forbes, for instance, drastically prioritizes taxes for its rankings. The corporate tax rate in the US is higher than that of Ireland, and (as Forbes summary straightforwardly admits) that pushes the US down in the rankings.<p>For a startup, there are significantly more important factors to consider than the corporate tax rate, not least because most startups are managed to avoid taxable profits for the first several years of their existence (sometimes all the way up until IPO). For instance:<p>* The US offers at-will employment. Ireland, at the top of the list, has an Unfair Dismissal act that allows employees with a year of tenure to file claims not only if they&#x27;re dismissed, but if they&#x27;re &quot;constructively&quot; dismissed --- that is to say, if their role in the company is substantially altered in a way that allows them to claim that they&#x27;re being &quot;managed out&quot; of the company. Constructive dismissal is a standard market clause for executives and acquirees in the US, but is certainly not a day-to-day feature of employment law.<p>* The World Bank Ease-of-doing-business index dings Ireland, putting them far below the US, for (among other things) the difficulty of enforcing contracts in Ireland; my tea-leaf-reading from the index&#x27;s abstracted data is that you have a good certainty of enforcing a contract base in Ireland, but that the process is more time-consuming and expensive than in the US, which is ranked 50 places higher than Ireland (at #11 overall).<p>* Similarly, the World Bank dings Denmark (putting them 2 places below the US overall) because (among other things) it&#x27;s significantly more difficult to incorporate in Denmark than in the US (where you can do it approximately as easily as ordering a non-one-click-compatible book from Amazon). Denmark also has mandatory severance of up to 6 months wages depending on tenure. 6 months wages isn&#x27;t a big deal to any big company, but for a startup, it could change the calculus of when the company will need to shutter during a downswing to meet its legal obligations to employees; in the US, so long as you can make good on any current wages owed employees, you can run up until the last minute.<p>* Sweden, which Forbes ranks higher than the US, has intricate employment law rules that require not only a legally defensible just cause for termination, but also a good faith effort on the part of an employer to find <i>another job</i> for an employee even if just cause exists to fire them. Sweden also allows shareholders to personally sue directors in a variety of situations. There is no way Forbes actually believes Sweden is a better place to start a company than the US.<p>Here is a combination of factors that makes the US a good place to start a business:<p>* Extremely well-tested corporation law that makes the formation of a company, distribution of equity, resolution of disputes, and enforcement of ownership relatively predictable.<p>* Virtually no government interference with the formation of companies themselves, so that you could practically form a new LLC for every individual Github project you started, pay less for that than you would for hosting costs, and stand a very good chance of having those LLCs defend your interests in disputes.<p>* Multiple classes of corporation, convertible between each other, with some optimized for &quot;click a button on a web page and create an LLC for my Github project&quot;, and others, not that much more expensive, that allow for multiple classes of shareholder, with the laws for those corporate forms predictable enough that hundreds of thousands of dollars of venture funding have become a <i>standardized packaged product</i> for promising startups (this is mind-boggling when you look at the societal infrastructure that enables it).<p>* A system of at-will employment that (for the most part) makes employment of workers almost risk free, so long as you don&#x27;t play fast and loose with owed salary or tax withholdings.<p>* A tax system that is reasonably simple, not disastrously onerous, and in many ways optimized for entrepreneurs (for instance, the differing taxation schemes offered for salary versus distributions, or the ease of deducting business expenses).<p>* Extremely well-tested employment law that, among other things, makes it straightforward to retain 1099 contractors for one-off projects without risking their conversion into full-time employees with severance rights.<p>* One of the world&#x27;s largest single borderless markets, such that you can start a company in Oregon and, with almost total certainty, be able to straightforwardly collect money for services (other than direct financial services, insurance, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture) from people in Florida.<p>* The host of the world&#x27;s largest equities markets, so that investors in startups can plow money into companies knowing that if that company is the 1 in 20 that is going to go public, the most lucrative place for it to go public is the country of its origin.<p>The US is probably not the best place in the world to start a company. Forbes and the World Bank agree that Hong Kong and New Zealand are better. But running a company in New Zealand also requires you to domicile in New Zealand, which can complicate hiring, marketing, and (if you sell anything physical) channel delivery.<p>If we had single-payer health coverage, I think we&#x27;d be <i>the</i> best country to do business in.",1396383224

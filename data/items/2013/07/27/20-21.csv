6114413,comment,6114342,6114342,1,0,DanBC,,,"This is an interesting article.  I tend to agree that site owners need to set limits for what is and isn&#x27;t acceptable.<p>But the list of what should and shouldn&#x27;t be done has some things that I disagree with.<p>One of the problems with moderators is that it creates the gap that trolls like to exploit.  Meta = death, especially when you can whip up an argument between regular posters about the actions of a moderator.<p>The accountable identities thing is also odd.  I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people posting with their real name being absolute arseholes.  I think some combination of persistent identity and karma is useful.  The identity doesn&#x27;t need to be shown.  So it&#x27;s anonymous from the point of view of people reading comments, but any up or downvotes go to the person&#x27;s account and accumulate.<p>One thing missed in the list is &quot;DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS.  DO NOT ENGAGE WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE IDIOTS.  JUST DOWN VOTE AND IGNORE.  OR JUST IGNORE.&quot;  Indeed, this should be emphasised so strongly that people down-vote those who do respond to trolls and idiots.  It&#x27;s intensely disappointing to see long threads on HN where one person has a viewpoint indistinguishable from idiocy or trolling.  Sure, try to learn why that person believes the freakish thing they do, but don&#x27;t waste time trying to convince them they&#x27;re wrong.<p>> Because a company like Google thinks it&#x27;s okay to sell video ads on YouTube above conversations that are filled with vile, anonymous comments.<p>Anything that can fix YouTube comments would be amazing.<p>> Because almost every great newspaper in America believes that it&#x27;s more important to get a few more page views on their website than to encourage meaningful discourse about current events within their community<p>Controversialism makes page views.  It&#x27;s sad.<p>Perhaps papers need to stick to &#x27;promoted comments&#x27;.  Perhaps they need to offer small payment or prizes for best comments?  Or they could find two decent commenters and ask them to have a (moderated) discussion?",1374958744

Your willpower may be finite but you can choose to spend it on the things that matter the most to you.

Eating at a different time will not make you lose weight. Combining foods differently will not make you lose weight.<p>Weight loss is a result of a negative energy balance. Now, all these things you listed can impact your energy intake (and thus energy balance), especially if you eat calorie less dense food. But you&#x27;re losing weight because you&#x27;re eating less.

The efficacy of time vs. money is context-dependent and one is not better than the other.<p>1) How much money are we talking here? An extra thousand dollars would be meaningful to a small organization, but $50 is not going to make a difference. Something like Habitat for Humanity has thousands of people donating $50, but small organizations don&#x27;t, and are constrained by lack of man hours as opposed to money.<p>2) Not every organization worth helping is a non-profit. Local community groups are often not non-profits or any sort of official organization at all. Once again, just because Habitat for Humanity is inundated with volunteers doesn&#x27;t mean your local group investigating police corruption is.<p>3) Many organizations don&#x27;t know how to use volunteers. This is partially because volunteers are notoriously unreliable, but it&#x27;s also because most groups don&#x27;t have outlets for self-motivated volunteers. These volunteers have to &quot;create a position&quot; for themselves, and if they&#x27;re motivated enough to help but not motivated to define their jobs then they&#x27;ll just lose interest and drop out.<p>4) A lot of organizations are composed entirely of volunteers. They might need money for something like webhosting, but they probably also need people to perform basic tasks like research or website administration. Unless you are giving the group enough money to hire a full-time staff member or something similar, there are severe limits on the marginal utility of a dollar.<p>5) To reiterate, not every non-profit/organization is Habitat for Humanity.

I&#x27;m a little unclear here, but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m getting.<p>Applying Alito&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourth Amendment (and everyone who joined with him in the Jones concurrence), the fact that manned aircraft are probability expensive make them fundamentally different than a much cheaper technology. The idea is a reasonable person knows manned aircraft are super expensive and thus law enforcement will only use them in certain situations. Because of this, such activity is not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, according to Alito, this does not mean that the search is still considered reasonable when the same activity becomes much cheaper. Indeed, he held that extremely lengthy tailing of a vehicle on public roads with a cheap GPS device constituted a search while the _same_ activity done manually by law enforcement did not constitute a search.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I think the FBI&#x27;s use of drones here is fine. I&#x27;m one of the last people on HN who would ever jump on this surveillance bandwagon/train wreck we are seeing. \nI bring this up because four Supreme Court justices believe that the cost of an activity can determine whether it constitutes a search (yes, it is not settled law). Because of this, drones being cheaper isn&#x27;t actually an argument for them being ok. The correct argument here is that drones are cheaper, but still probability expensive to deploy en-mass against the public. If drones ever become cheap enough to do that (like the GPS device in Jones), then it&#x27;s a whole different ballgame.",1374956214

A couple years ago I got into burlesque dance; two hours of class every week got me into amazing shape. That&#x27;s stopped for various reasons, and my weight&#x27;s slowly crept up. I haven&#x27;t found anything that I delight in doing the same way, so I&#x27;m out of shape. I&#x27;ve been fighting it but it&#x27;s an uphill climb.<p>I mean, yeah, to a large degree it WAS &quot;eat less, move more&quot; - but I wasn&#x27;t thinking of it in terms of losing weight or getting fit. I was thinking of it in terms of &quot;learning to move in frighteningly sexy ways&quot;.",1374955798

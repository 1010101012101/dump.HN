When you try to interact with HTML, it's very inconsistent, and it's difficult for you to get a grasp of the rules and what is supposed to happen where.<p>I would suggest starting with Java. Java is a modern language, you can get a free compiler and IDE, there are tons of excellent books, and you will learn all the concepts of object oriented programming without having to deal with the 'interesting' parts of the machine.<p>Set yourself a goal, for example to create a GUI app that organises your MP3s or so. Then work on that as your way of learning Java.<p>After you know Java, the other imperative languages are mostly about syntax. There are no real new concepts to learn.<p>Now, I do not use Java personally. I use C++, and I started with VB. It's useful to learn C++ early, but only attempt this if you are a dedicated and patient person.",1210866614

However, I've always thought that there approaches a point where this is counter-productive. You're assuming that you can replace those 10% with workers better than they were. But, after you do this long enough, your bottom 10% are probably at least average, or above average, and it may be a better business decision to keep those on instead of hiring and training unknown candidates.

One assignment, I spent most of the time allocated trying to get the program reasonably fast enough in Python to finish in less than a day.  If a mistake was not apparent until the program had run for a couple of hours, it totally killed all of the exploratory programming advantages that Python has.<p>I finally gave up and rewrote the entire thing in Java a day before the assignment was due.  I got my algorithm to converge in under 2 hours (had left the Python version running much longer with than this with no converging in sight), and was able to get some decent results to turn in.<p>Maybe I'm just greedy.  I want it all.  Speed, exploratory programming, lots of libraries.  Common Lisp offers the first two, the last, not so much.  Java offers 1 and 3, Python 2 and 3.<p>My next languages to learn are Scala and/or Clojure.

Because of this, the likelihood that F. Scott Fitzgerald's work was a veiled reference to man-on-animal love is very low. Second, there is no evidence than any of the characters are attracted to animals. While Gatsby does have an attraction to Daisy, there is nothing in the text to indicate that her character metaphorically embodies animalistic qualities. In conclusion, there is no possible way that the Great Gatsby represents an attempt to introduce zoophilia to mainstream American society.

One issue in the Arc community is there's no clear way to contribute. A lot of this angst about lacking libraries could be turned into a polite suggestion to help build the language.<p>Perhaps there should be AEP = Arc Enhancement Proposals a la Python's PEPs.",1210864119

190545,comment,190295,190536,0,0,hhm,,,"Well, enumerating a finite list of things is not something you wouldn't do in a math proof. Now if I say: X=""primes are all multiples of three"", ""why isn't X true?"", there are many obvious answers to that. For starters, because there's at least an element of primes (7), that is not a multiple of three.<p>That should be enough to disprove: ""there's never an explanation for why something isn't true"", and that's the point. I would have preferred a simple explaination of why PG thinks X isn't true than the assertion that such a thing can't be explained (actually I suspect he was being humourous or something like that, obviously he has to have a reason to think like he thinks).<p>Also, you can always reply: ""because I don't want to!"", or ""because I have other things to do"", or ""because I don't see a reason to"" (it's like asking ""why should I..?""), to ""why don't you ... X?"" :)",1210864070

You can have both a well-designed language and a great selection of libraries, in Python or Ruby.<p>Not that it's Arc's fault; Arc just isn't at the point in its lifecycle where the libraries are at Python level. It's more like Python 0.5. It's a good goal to have though.",1210863871

10862815,comment,10861334,10861638,0,0,tagrun,,,"> I would argue for the opposite: One problem with linux is that you can&#x27;t run untrusted software without it getting the same access as the user. That&#x27;s exactly what the appification is.\n> I see package managers as a source of some problems of linux: Package maintainers are a unneeded middleman between the writers of the software and you, package managers interact with the whole system, scattering files around the whole filesystem and running scripts as root when installing/uninstalling packages.<p>High-standards imposed by distros (see for example: <a href=""https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/</a>) and tedious work of packagers has been a very important part of the free software ecosystem, and kept GNU/Linux snoopware-, malware- and virus-free and trustable [1]. They are far from &quot;unneeded middleman&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a very recent example of this system at work: Chromium sneaks a binary blob which secretly listens to your microphone and sends data to Google: <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/648392/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/648392/</a><p>This is just one instance, there has been many many examples of this.<p>There are just so many, let me say, shady, &quot;apps&quot; out there, so I don&#x27;t install anything from Google Play Store on my smartphone. On my desktop/laptop however, I feel safe installing whatever I need from the official repositories.\nI personally don&#x27;t want to use a distro to which &quot;app&quot; developers from Android ecosystem can freely push their programs (and updates to them).<p>> Applications being files/folders that can be installed/uninstalled with cp/rm seems way more unixy to me.<p>But that&#x27;s essentially what a package manager does for you, although it takes away your freedom to screw up in the process. In GNU/Linux, it essentially 1) protects you from screwing up your system accidentally 2) allows you trust system-wide binaries (assuming that your distro is trustable).<p>App Stores are also package managers, so I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re trying to point out here.<p>====<p>[1] I&#x27;m excluding Ubuntu here. Ubuntu comes with spyware, spies on you by default and monetizes the privacy and trust of its users [2]. I don&#x27;t trust it, I don&#x27;t use it, and I recommend against it.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html</a>",1452225177

Look at the Amazon Fire TV equipped with a Mediatek 64 bit quad core A72 + A53 SoC. The same SoC is scheduled to be in Chromebooks shortly.<p>This tiny 4 inch by 1  inch box can play 4k at 30fps, provide super fast internet browsing, Facebook, Youtube, Office apps, video conferencing and play Android 3D titles well. And it costs 64 Pounds or 90 USD! It geekbenches 1600/3500 which is pretty respectable compared to an Intel i3 which retails for around $150 just for the CPU. Why spend anything more for grandma&#x27;s, mum&#x27;s or a just a general PC. It also has good support for Kodi so no need for expensive HTPCs.<p>So here is a 60 GBP device doing a of lot of thing a traditional basic PC or laptop does at a fraction of the price, power, noise and size! This is disruptive.<p>The only thing holding it back is the absence of proper desktop support in Android and the relatively closed nature especially GPU of the Arm ecosystem. Also the PC ecosystem is accustomed to a much more open hardware and software playing field, and the driver scenario for ARM and Google&#x27;s control of Android itself can be problematic.<p>Android is currently completely touch oriented and even though you can attach a keyboard and mouse, as the recent Ars review highlights [1] there are quite a few rough edges.<p>Remix OS is a step in that direction but it appears some of the issues are serious enough that only Google can address. A better situation is ARM being more open, Linux is already well supported on ARM so if it opens up the drivers in good faith without the back and forth of licensor and licensee that open source developers deal with, desktop need not depend just on Android.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/12/android-on-the-desktop-not-really-good-but-better-than-youd-think/2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/12/android-on-the-deskto...</a>",1452224675

Postgrest is conceptually a function that computes a REST API for a PostgreSQL database, and tables in a PostgreSQL can (for better or worse) have compound primary keys, which do not map well to a simple URL path.

But if you want to talk about elites, money becomes only a yardstick, a metric rather than a resource.<p>Certain people do not value money directly.  They value having more money than other.  They value relative wealth.  This is why a billionaire will fight for that extra 100k from a contractor or may cut wages on a whim.  This drive for relative disparity occurs on the large scale (say a billionaire going after casino workers) the medium scale (athlete A wanting to be paid more than athlete B regardless of number) and too at smallest scales (wanting to be the highest paid in the office).<p>This is human nature.  The danger occurs when a powerful person, unable to meaningfully increase their wealth due to the law of diminished returns, decides to attack those with less.",1452223218

Users feel they can be more relaxed in their interactions when they cannot be recalled later. To quote the article:<p><pre><code>    There’s no public view count, follower count, likes count, or any other social\n    dick-measuring contest. You can just put whatever you’re doing on Snapchat; if\n    people don’t like it, who gives a fuck, you’ll never know. There’s no\n    expectation of balling out 24/7.\n    \n    Consequently, on Snapchat I’ll post to my daily Story almost twice as much as\n    I’ll post to Twitter and Facebook combined to reach only a fraction of the\n    number of people. The cost of content creation is extremely low, and Snapchat\n    makes it fun to think about what aspects of what I’m doing every day might be\n    cool for other people to see.\n\n</code></pre>\nMany people do feel social pressure to be &quot;cool&quot;, to perform to the perceived expectations of the groups they belong too. Given that, many people clamor for &quot;lower stakes&quot; interactions. While the same &quot;lowering of the stakes&quot; could happen at a social level, and I believe that is something that&#x27;s happening slowly over the long term, a much faster route is to use a tool that enforces lower stakes, such as Snapchat.<p>If you are someone who does not find the appeal in low-stakes interactions, then it&#x27;s quite understandable that Snapchat may not appeal to you.",1452222807

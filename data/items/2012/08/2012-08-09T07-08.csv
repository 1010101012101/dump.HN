4360045,comment,4358658,4359031,4,0,adekok,,,">  if I create two filenames that are identical except for normalization, how can the ""human"" layer possibly handle this?<p>The ""human IO"" layer is responsible for normalization of strings sent to the rest of the system.  Therefore, your scenario cannot occur in normal operations.  If it does occur, <i>too bad</i>.  Some part of the system allowed an illegal operation, and you now have two filenames which may display as identical, but which are stored as different ""buckets of bits"".<p>Your other scenario is the same.  The issue of composed versus non-composed characters doesn't come up, as all input is normalized.  If your human input layer can't normalize it, then <i>tough</i>.  The system is broken.<p>What happens when you create a filename on a ""new"" system, and then mount it on an ""old"" system?  What happens when you add new code points to unicode?  What happens when you create new composition rules?<p>In your design, the answer is ""oh, crap"".  The older file systems will make <i>different</i> decisions about name comparisons than a new file system.  This leads to exactly the inconsistencies you're worried about.<p>In contrast, the IETF design means all file systems always make the same decisions.  ""memcmp"" always returns the same results.  Old systems <i>cannot</i> create file names using new code points, because their ""display IO"" layer forbids it.  Again, if such a string are created, then the system created a string it can't understand.  The system is broken.<p>It seems you have strong opinions here.  These issues are being worked through in all internet protocols.  The answer is <i>not</i> ""fix every protocol to do string normalization and/or i18n"".<p>Wait 5 years.  You'll see this design take over every internet protocol, and (IMHO) every new file system.  Nothing else is workable.",1344498876

The iPhone SDK had been announced in October 2007 and been made available in February, Android 1.0 would only be released in September (though the beta had started in November 2007), the Windows 7 RTM would only happen in 2009 and W7P in 2010 so the Windows world was still ""old windows"" (on which regular Qt worked) and Windows Mobile 6.<p>One can easily assume that, as soon as the deal was announced and likely to go through, Trolltech had little reason to work on porting Qt to non-nokia platforms (out of the 2 months or so they'd have had for the Android beta, and negative 2 months for iOS).<p>And once Trolltech/Qt was part of Nokia, why would Nokia fund Qt/Android or Qt/iOS? The original plan was to build Nokia's own ""next-generation platform"" Maemo with it after all.<p>As to third parties, they did attempt porting Qt (ultimately fizzling out, for the most part):<p>* qt-iphone (Qt/Cocoa Touch) <a href=""http://www.qt-iphone.com/Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qt-iphone.com/Introduction.html</a><p>* Necessitas (Qt/Android) <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/necessitas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/home/necessitas/</a>",1344498528

Nokia had no idea what they were doing with Qt and the Mobilin/Maemo/Meego and now Tizen projects were a farce from start to finish. I'm sure as strategies they looked good in Power Point, but they clearly had no clue how to turn them/it into a credible consumer OS. They very much remind me of the bumbling, bullet point oriented aimlesness of the failed OS projects of the 90s - Taligent, Pink, Cairo, etc.<p>However, now Qt is in the hands of a company that does seem to understand the technology and has a realistic and executable business plan.

The advantage of a S800 will be the range (25mm -> uselessly long without a tripod and good light), compared to the 43mm prime iPhone; apature and image quality will be similar. Also, the Nikon will have niceties like vibration reduction, a flash (maybe), smarter focusing / metering, better processing (maybe).<p>The real question is, who would want one? I'd say - people with dumb phones who carry cameras; and hipsters who want to be seen with a camera while they play Angry Birds on the bus.

Even if your example was relevant, which is not, everyone knows you can't ever get idiots in any IT department to fix something like missing password. Fuck, nobody gets a job in IT in a college department without being terminally brain-dead. You are not smart enough to realize that the right thing to do is go in the server room with an ax, and hope that when they rebuild the system they'll get a clue. Sheesh, you people are the reason we need an Internet license, to prevent folks like you from polluting the web with nonsense.<p>Version 2: Dear samdk, I fail to see why people would fix the email system faster if you criticize them or make them resent you. You did not provide the details of the story, but I know of a similar case where the problem was fixed in private, technical, and polite e-mails. That case involved early Sun4 systems where everybody could read anybody's screen over the network, so it was relatively critical too... All it took was showing the sysadmin's screen on mine to get things fixed rather rapidly.<p>> (And I say that with the full knowledge that my phrasing will make you less receptive to my argument.)<p>This means you write this <i>for yourself</i> and not to <i>fix things</i>. This is the reason why rule #1 is a good rule: it places the other guy in the center. Your ultimate goal in a negotiation is to get the other side to do what you want. This means they are the center of the universe at that moment. You illustrated that very well with your VC example. What makes a VC different from an IT admin? That you think they are more powerful?<p>Jon Kershaw, who manages killer whales for a leaving, likes to bring the point that if you try to force a killer whale to do something, you end up dead more often than you want.

I watched alcoholism and substance abuse skyrocket, relationships crumble (including my own), people slept on office couches, two developers got divorced, one nervous breakdown.</i><p>This is evil.<p>I don't mean that like Google-don't-be-evil evil, which is a business practice one finds either unsavory or advantageous to competitors which one dislikes.  I don't mean cartoonishly evil, like a villain killing someone to clue in anyone still wondering which character to root for after seeing the black cape and hearing the cackle.  I don't mean hyperbolically evil, like the word carelessly thrown around when one's political opponents suggest +/- 3% changes in governmental policies.<p>I mean <i>evil</i>: characterized by sin, injurious to the proper ordering of society, an offense against the dignity of man, in contravention to the natural law as discoverable by reason.  You could get a Catholic dogmatist, an atheist Marxist professor, and a hard-core libertarian together in a room, and they'd all call that evil.  Their explanations would proceed from different and frequently incompatible axioms but they'd focus on the same parts of the act and come to strikingly reconcilable conclusions.",1344496068

4359908,comment,4358852,4359093,5,0,k-mcgrady,,,"I agree (mostly). Social networks can provide value. But the cost of using them might be too high.<p>Earlier this year I took one month off twitter completely. Before that I was scared to miss a tweet. I would wake up a read through what I missed while I was asleep. But after a few days of not using it I didn't feel I needed it. I may have been a few hours late hearing about the latest 'big' tech story but that was all.<p>After one month I went back to using it but a few days ago I decided to shut it off again. Even if you follow interesting people, and you want to hear their ideas, you still have to wade through a lot of crap. For example, one thing a lot of people post if baby photos. Why post photos of your child to a public service where you are being followed mostly by strangers? So, even if you are careful who you follow there are still noise control issues.<p>I could image Facebook being the same for me if I wasn't so careful about who I friend. Recently I tried their subscriber feature and subscribed to tech bloggers, news pages etc. After a few days I felt like never using Facebook again. After removing those subscriptions are bringing it down to just my close friends again it was fine. Largely because Facebook's noise controls are better. They auto created lists for me (School friends, close friends, acquaintances) and made it easy to say what type of updates I wanted from each person.<p>Regarding app.net I don't think it will succeed. But even if it does get off the ground and get a decent number of users I don't see the need for another social network. It seems like the reason for it to exist is the API and the  fact they promise not to screw over developers. But developers aren't going to build apps and use the API if there are only a few thousand people on the network. They will go where the people (and money) are - Twitter and Facebook.",1344495834

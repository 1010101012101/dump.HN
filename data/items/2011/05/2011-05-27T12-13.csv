2591266,comment,2590535,2590535,101,0,solson,,,"Having been poor (not 3rd world poor, poor by American standards) I found the most difficult thing is leaving the poverty stricken network. You don't feel like you've made it until you reject the entire mindset. Until then, you feel like you've sold out. My mother still makes me feel guilty and shames me every time I see her. Until you've had a parent who shames you for doing better than they did, you'll never understand the trap. I tell my upper middle class neighbors about this and they can't imagine parents who wouldn't want their children to do better than them. While I still talk to my parents I've dumped the rest of the network. I protect myself and my family from my old network. Their whole way of thinking is poison. With many of them you risk violence, drugs, abuse, sexual abuse, racism, etc. Even if you trust one or two of them you can never trust who they will bring you or your family in contact with. No amount of mentoring or example setting has helped, it just breeds resentment. Their world view traps them right where they are and their rejection, resentment, and hostility to a better way of life creates their poverty and isolation. Sending them to Harvard isn't going to make a damn bit of difference. Well, MAYBE if you sent one or two, but if you sent enough, they'd just ruin Harvard.<p>I came to the conclusion many years ago that in America poverty is a contagious mindset, nothing more. But I do understand that it is a difficult mindset to escape due to social issues. In all honesty, in most cases the middle class and rich have good reason not to network with the poor.",1306501148

So I have certainly had conversations with foreigners where I agreed with some of their criticisms. And I have also had friends who lived in a country where the country as a whole had a negative view of the US and where the US had a negative view of their country and it wasn't some big personal issue between us.  In some cases, it was treated more like an in-joke.  In this particular case, my friend was so consistently critical in a very ugly way and so rabid about it that I did often feel like ""If you think all Americans are pure evil simply for being born here, why on earth are you friends with me?  How sick is that?""<p>This was an extremely good friend.  I still miss them.  One of the things that stops me from trying to reach out to them is that I don't know how to get past these issues.

When you're that young, everything seems attainable (even if just a little bit). Unfortunately, as these kids transition out of high school into adulthood, they begin to realize that they may not have a better path.

3640368,comment,3638506,3638506,4,0,slurgfest,,,"I don't see anything here showing Python to be embarrassing. Python IS dynamically typed, which puts the burden on you to do type checking when it is necessary. But everybody already knew that.<p>None is just a singleton value. A particular object may be None, or may be 4, or may be whatever. However, you cannot assign a new value to 4, or None, so it isn't accurate to say that any object could have a value of None. It isn't that an object might have something in it, or not. It's that the object might be None, or something other than None, JUST as it might be 4, or something other than 4. That is just how it works in Python's type system. There really is no notion of ""has no value"". None IS a value. If (for some reason, hopefully a good one) you mean to exclude it and raise an error, you must deal with that in exactly the same way as you would exclude and raise an error on any other particular value you found important.<p>In Python, it is not true that anything might not have a value. Python itself doesn't even have predicates for ""has something in it"" or ""doesn't have something in it."" That might be a common idiom using None by convention, but it's by no means inherent to Python, or necessary. It's really not the same as NULL.<p>What's true is that any argument (or namespace binding) could have a value of None. OR 4, or a certain dict, or whatever. That's just because Python isn't doing automatic type checking. None does not take any special role which you do not give to it. Its semantics are up for grabs. NOTHING in Python actually forces you to use None to denote ""no value."" And it is BY DESIGN that Python does not automatically type check everything. YOU must decide whether and how to type check arguments - not at all, by using your own decorators or asserts or some library, or by not using Python. Python isn't a bondage and discipline language. If you don't like that, don't use it, it's just that simple. There's no need to call it embarrassing, or gloat about how you schooled somebody who showed interest in your favorite language.<p>So. If you use the return value of a function without a return statement, you are asking for a value which may be None, the same as if you had written 'return None'. You bear responsibility for that decision - the same as you bear responsibility for feeding int(4) or a module object to your functions. If you don't like that, then don't do it.<p>Under normal circumstances, without doing anything special, you will get something like a TypeError if someone (e.g. you) feeds a None to a function not anticipating it.<p>You only have to handle that in the case where it is vitally important to have a different exception or other behavior. You don't need ""six hundred and forty nine thousand two hundred and eighty-eight if statements"" unless you are being needlessly compulsive to begin with, in a vain effort to emulate a bondage-and-discipline language.  Python isn't even supposed to be a bondage-and-discipline language, so it's no revelation that it isn't good at that. Trying to use it that way is just doing it wrong.<p>(n.b. Instead of using imperative if-statements, you might prefer: f(v) if v else None, for those instances where it's even necessary).<p>Dear Author:<p>It's cool that you are proud of yourself, but in this case I think your advocacy is being hurt by your ego. I have never gotten the impression that Haskell programmers in general are smug and boastful. If YOU don't want to be thought of as smug and boastful, then don't publish articles like this where you are smugly bragging about who you schooled.",1330372377

Overall, it's nice to have the ability to pay for food and a shelter. But the traditional job with an hour commute each way is not the only, and in many cases not the optimal way to do this. There may be reasons to be thankful for working at this particular job (That's very satisfying work, that improves the world?) or owning that particular car (It's a fun car to drive, and gives you another set of autonomy) But the concept that you should just stfu about the commute and be thankful of the job and car is manipulative and condescending.<p>For this particular example, the response to ""having a hour long commute"" should be solutions, which is otherwise suggested in other contexts. Sadly, while good employers can provide many solutions, such as improved commute options, or the ability to work partially from an office/coworking-space/coffee shop closer to home, most employees are left with the only solution of either dealing with it, or finding a new job.",1330372179

There is a definite learning curve between Javascript and CoffeeScript. List comprehensions, extended regular expressions, and splats - these are just a few of the things that make up that learning curve. The changes in variable scoping that CoffeeScript makes is another.<p>I think that perhaps the best practice for publishing a CoffeeScript project should probably be to append a .coffee to the name rather than the usual .js.

It's a common fear but not based in actual experience, and therefore irrational.<p>When you have an established group of customers, yes, if you ignore support entirely for a while, you will likely lose a few. But if you have a largish group, losing a few won't matter. It's all about leverage. When you have a few customers, each one matters very much. When you have several hundred or several thousand, each one matters only a little. You have the leverage, instead of them.<p>That is why running a product biz is not ""wage slavery"" -- assuming you set it up right, which brings us to<p>2. If you want to be able to take lots of time off, design your business around it. Yes, if you create a mission-critical infrastructure service, you will either have to have support people in place. But you don't HAVE to create that kind of business. You can do something that's less mission-critical and with customers who are more laid-back.<p>3. There is a huge gulf between ""totally ignoring your business"" and ""putting it on pause for a while."" My husband and I recently took a month-long trip to NZ and we hired a very part-time support person to run interference while we were gone. She was able to answer basic questions, gather details about bugs, etc., and tell customers with harder issues that we would be back soon. I worked about an hour a day average (2-3 hours at a stretch, not every day). It worked great. Unusually, we had 1 server issue with our 2nd product. My husband took a bit of time to restart and contact our freelance sys admin, and that was that.<p>In the scheme of things, people will cancel for all kinds of reasons, many of which you cannot possibly control, and it's not a big deal. Commerce is a business relationship, and people end business relationships when they do not feel like they're getting a return of value for their money, and that's that.<p>I know some folks would consider it a deep moral failing to not do everything in one's power to deliver the world's best customer service.

A <i>noncompetition</i> covenant is sometimes used as a means of enforcing an agreement's use restrictions.  It says, in essence, ""to make sure you don't use our confidential information without our permission, you agree not to compete with us at all in the following geographic area for the following time period ....""<p>NDAs are commonly used to help two (or more) parties decide whether they want to do business with each other.  As a result, NDAs <i>per se</i> hardly ever contain noncompetition provisions --- it's usually too soon in the parties' relationship for one of them to be making that kind of commitment.<p>Putting a noncompete in an NDA would be tantamount to a man and a woman agreeing to get a coffee to get to know each other --- and the woman says, <i>oh by the way, I need you to agree that, for the next two years, you won't talk to any other women.</i>  Imagine the guy's reaction ....<p>A slightly different situation is when one company (the acquirer) is talking to another (the target) about a potential buy-out.  When things start to get serious, the parties likely will sign a no-shop agreement that says, in essence, the target won't go looking for other potential acquirers.

If I'm going to actually build real\n    applications in this way, I don't need to run my development environment\n    on someone else's website.\n</code></pre>\nThe key benefit of having an in-browser implementation of something like Clojurescript isn't:<p><pre><code>    ""I can run my dev environment on the web.""\n</code></pre>\nit's:<p><pre><code>    ""There IS no dev environment.""\n</code></pre>\nLook at how absolutely trivial and frictionless it is to get started with LessCSS[1], and compare it to the morass of libraries, source file locations, command-line invocations, and extra compilation steps that Clojurescript requires[2].<p>You can introduce someone to LessCSS and have them working with it in five minutes.  No cross-platform problems, no installation, no figuring out how to automatically compile code when it changes, or anything else like that.<p><i>Once you need</i> the extra speed, sure, have a command line tool to precompile everything to vanilla JS.  LessCSS has this exactly.  Heck, sure, maybe even run it through the Closure compiler if you want crazy speed.  But don't optimize the development process for huge apps at the expense of small ones, because even if you only care about those huge apps (which would be a mistake -- there are some really cool small apps out there) you need people writing smaller stuff first to learn how to use Clojurescript, create libraries for it, convince others to use it, and so on.<p>Before anyone screams at me that I'm caring too much about that filthy concept of ""easy"", let me say that I loved Rich's talk on Simple and Easy, but I feel like it may have actually done some harm to the Clojure community by giving them an excuse for making conceptually-simple but hard-to-get-started-with-and-use libraries and tools.<p>Simple is more important than easy, yes, but if you can make something easier <i>without sacrificing simplicity</i> then you should!<p>No one should say ""I don't have to thoroughly document this because it's conceptually simple so you should just read the code"", or ""we're going to make something that has lots of uncomplected layers and who cares if it's performant enough for real world use"", or ""I don't feel like making this a single-step install, so if anyone complains I'll just say they care too much about ease of use"".<p>In Clojurescript's case it actually seems like the combination of Clojurescript code calling Clojure macros and then being compiled by a compiler written in Clojure and then compiled again with the Closure compiler (aside: this naming is just hilarious) is really complex.  There's a lot of mental effort required to say ""Hmm, where do I put everything so all the different parts of my project can talk to each other?"".<p>A lot of this can be solved in a few different ways:<p>- More mature tooling with sane defaults, so I don't need to know everything a library is doing to use it.  The entire point of a tool/abstraction is to take care of this stuff for me.  lein-cljsbuild is off to a good start, but as an example: don't make me specify where my .cljs files are when it can `find . -name '.cljs'` and figure it out for most people itself!<p>- Documentation.  This is a problem with the Clojure community in general.  Auto-generated API docs are worse than useless because they fool developers into thinking they've written actual documentation.<p>Another problem in my own experience is that the performance of all of these extra layers is just awful compared to something lighter weight.<p>If you saw Chris Granger's screencast about the Overtone controller webapp the other day, did you notice that he often had to refresh in the browser a bunch of times before his Clojurescript changes were compiled and took effect?  It's a sub-100 line Clojurescript file and yet a several gigahertz machine[3] takes a noticeably long time to show us our changes?  We have to mash the refresh button until we're pretty sure our changes have compiled?<p>I really, really want to love Clojurescript, because it's got some beautiful ideas, but it almost seems to have adopted Haskell's ""avoid success at all costs"" mantra.  That's great if you're building an experiment in programming language theory, not so great if you want to save real live people's time and frustration.<p>TL;DR: Clojurescript makes it really complicated to get to a black triangle moment[4] and that's a bad thing.  An in-browser version of Clojurescript would reduce the time and effort needed to get there.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://lesscss.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesscss.org/</a><p>[2]: Yes, I know about lein-cljsbuild.

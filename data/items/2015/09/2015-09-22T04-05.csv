10256692,comment,10254667,10256303,0,0,paulmd,,,"Wideband radios are not all that new.  My radio is a Kenwood TS-820S from the 70s and covers multiple bands from 160M to 10M.  My cheapo Radio Shack walkie talkie from 15 years ago covers most (all?) of 6M to 2M (i.e. all kinds of serious bands that I&#x27;m not allowed to transmit on).  My Yaesu VX-5R from 10 years ago can do full-on wideband receive, from 6M up to microwave.<p>With the help of an auto-tuner to match the SWRs there&#x27;s no physical reason I can&#x27;t transmit/receive bands I&#x27;m not supposed to.  It&#x27;s not like tweaking a VFO is really a technical challenge, they&#x27;re well-understood technologies.  And the frequency display on my radio is literally just a frequency counter for my own edification, the base TS-820 non-S model doesn&#x27;t even have one.  To find your frequency you look at the dial, there&#x27;s a printed scale for your band.  You know what happens if you are pushing the limit too far?  The FCC tracks you down and you get a pink slip telling you that they know what you&#x27;re up to.<p>You both underestimate what older radios can do, and overstate what newer radios can do relative to them.  The reasons that you didn&#x27;t see people transmitting off-band before was primarily <i>social</i>, not technological.  As for receive, the FCC was flipping out about people intercepting cellphone calls on omniband radios - <i>15 years ago</i>.  Omni SDR was around 10 years ago too, with the same capabilities (see: GNU Radio), it just cost more than $10 for a rig.",1442897963

10256686,comment,10254639,10256505,0,0,joslin01,,,"What I want (Scala land):<p><pre><code>  trait Robot

    def body = Body(engine)

  class SunnyRobot extends Robot

  class OilyRobot extends Robot

</code></pre>
Protocol extensions don&#x27;t hold state. They are meant to provide default implementations for a type, not as a 1:1 relationship with the class it&#x27;s implementing functionality for. Following what you&#x27;re saying, I would be doing something like this:<p>* `extension Robot where Self = SunnyRobot { def gas() = ... }`<p>* `extension Robot where Self = OilyRobot { def gas() = ... }`<p>That looks all good and well, right? Ok, well now my sunny robot wants to find the sun and my oily robot wants to go find oil. How to provide functionality unique to each of them? Maybe I&#x27;m just not getting something, but I&#x27;m pretty sure protocol extensions are not the answer to the problem I&#x27;m trying to describe.<p>When you&#x27;re working in front-end land, you can do your best to stay functional and be cool and all that jazz, but it&#x27;s just a waste of time usually. You&#x27;re going to use a lot of state and you just have to learn how to manage that effectively (IMO). What this boils down to for me is that I might build a cell that does 3 things great and will be on every cell, but then business designs call for 2 slightly different cells still based upon that main cell. Oh and when those different cells are tapped, different things should happen.<p>So again, I just go about doing it with the simple base class gonna throw you an exception unless you override the &quot;abstract&quot; method. This way, I get to keep state going down and classes can actually fill up naturally rather than playing the protocol game.",1442897845

Oh right: nothing.<p>> That you find people&#x27;s concern over undisclosed relationships in reporting something worthy of mockery is appalling and quite frankly all the evidence needed to show you&#x27;re out to push an agenda that requires overlooking a very traditional staple of journalistic integrity.<p>That you find it remarkable or notable that people who write about games know people who make games shows that you have very little understanding of the trade press. &quot;I know this person&quot; is not a relationship that needs disclosure.<p>There&#x27;s no clear consensus on things like Kickstarter, by the way. While investment would be a clear ethical breach, Kickstarter is--by law--not an investment. Kickstarter backers are not acquiring any kind of stake in the company. There&#x27;s no clear journalistic rule that would, for example, prohibit backing Kickstarters but still permit preordering games (and I&#x27;ve never once seen a gator demand that game preorders be disclosed).<p>Similarly, the distinction between, for example, making payments through Patreon, subscribing to a game such as WoW, or buying a DLC season pass is quite subtle, and there are no universally agreed, widely established rules on what is and isn&#x27;t acceptable.

In the later days its GCs (it provided several different, cooperating GCs) were quite sophisticated.<p>> Today you get garbage collections in your web browser that would embarrass any Lisp Machine ever built.<p>It won&#x27;t. Browser GCs are actually not more sophisticated compared to a later day Symbolics GC. The language model of JavaScript is much more primitive than what ran on a Lisp Machine.<p>Lisp Machines had the same problem like we have today: a hierarchy of memory with different speeds. Very little &#x27;fast&#x27; memory, and much much slower, but much larger, virtual memory. Actually the Symbolics Lisp Machines had pretty sophisticated GCs which you even won&#x27;t find today on typical machines. Caching was all important on Lisp Machines and there was a lot done for that.<p>A typical Lisp Machine in the Mid 80s had something like 16 MB RAM and 100 MB or more virtual memory on slow disks locally or over the network. End 80s it was 40MB RAM and a couple of hundred MB virtual memory on local disks. Without effective caching strategies this would not have been useful. Some special machines had more RAM, but this was very very expensive.<p>These machines saved optimized images from which they booted. The memory was sorted according to object types into regions. Lists were converted into a vector-like representation (cdr coding), etc etc.<p>At runtime a copying GC would move objects around into generations with object-sorted regions, improving locality. An ephemeral GC tracks changed memory in RAM.<p>Additionally there were a lot of data structures which were under special memory management like networks packets or raster arrays.",1442896413

The point of a salt is so that same password does not result in the same hash for two different users. The key point is that attack time scales linearly with user count, which makes a difference in the actual crack rate <i>when the breach is large</i>.<p>When cracking passwords, to crack the most hashes, your inner loop is iterating the <i>salts</i> from the database while the outer loop moves down the dictionary. Crucially, that means the salt should always be the first bits fed to your hashing function, or else the cracker can optimize away some hashing cycles across users. HMAC will do the right thing here if salt is passed as the &#x27;key&#x27; (although the way it expands the key to the block size is somewhat flawed). Feeding the salt to the hashing function first approximately halves the crack rate versus appending salt at the end, by preventing any reuse of hash function state in the inner loop.

I&#x27;m under the impression that if the OEM/importer demonstrates in their filing that their proof of conformance documentation will always be representative (valid) of the device no matter what the user can do through user-accessible features and menus, i.e. they can prove that the radio module is locked down in some way other than the main device firmware, this should be sufficient and does in fact meet the requirements.<p>After all, preventing APs from stomping on licensed spectrum due to wrong country selection seems to be half of what&#x27;s driving all this anyway.",1442894858

10256565,comment,10255997,10256444,0,0,nstart,,,"Fair point. Was going by the numbers of 3M USD seed round in 2012, and 17M in 2014. Without much major press and valuations being made public, it&#x27;s kind of safe to assume that the 3M USD was burning out by the end of 2013. 14M from 2013 to 2015 would be 7M per year. Assuming rising costs from both running the business, 5M and 9M across two years seems plausible.<p>Given the number of employees in the company (26), 3 co founders, who form half of a 6 C-level team, it&#x27;s likely that the team size increased along that curve as well (3M, 5M, 9M). This is entirely speculation at this point.<p>But after some further reading, it&#x27;s possible that their business model may have just been not profitable. For each reader who read more than 10% of a book, the full retail price of the book is paid out to publishers. For people reading 3-4 books a month, they would be making a loss from those customers.<p>If you aren&#x27;t the sort that reads 3-4 books a month, then you are also probably not the kind of person who spends a 10 USD subscription service to an &#x27;all-you-can-read&#x27; ebook service. Therefore the larger base of customers there were probably loss makers. So assuming a growing customer base made up of loss makers it&#x27;s entirely likely that they burnt out funds. Now that the running costs of a business in general were clarified in a reply above it actually makes sense that the money could have run out.",1442894558

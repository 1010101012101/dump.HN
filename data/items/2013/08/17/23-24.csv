Some young people really don&#x27;t have a clue. She&#x27;s among the worlds royalty, &quot;The Princess and the Pea,&quot; and doesn&#x27;t realize it. She&#x27;s pretty clueless to not even acknowledge that people all around her are dealing with much more serious personal struggles. That would be the polite thing to do and might mitigate some of the cringe factor. Wow, talk about a life of luxury of time, youth, health and choice, that many can only dream about. She&#x27;s pretty too. I&#x27;d trade lives with her in a New York minute. I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll be fine.",1376783984

No, the issue is that a program has at least two different logical structures: its lexical organization in text, and its dynamic organization in time. You want these two to be as closely related as possible, because humans rely mostly on the program text to understand it.<p>&quot;Time&quot; here doesn&#x27;t mean CPU time, it means logical time--the temporal (as distinct from textual) order of operations in the program. To put it another way, the &quot;time&quot; that matters for program clarity is not when stuff happens at lower levels (e.g. when does the OS evict my thread) but what happens when in the source code itself.

Just getting the public to turn around on pot (something that is genuinely mild, not physically addictive, and is <i>plainly</i> mis-classified as Schedule I) has taken a <i>ton</i> of effort.  Furthermore the only reason that effort has been so successful is because pot is so widely used; somewhere around half of all Americans have smoked pot at some point in their life.  You don&#x27;t have any sort of similar base on which to launch a publicity campaign for crack <i>(in the specific case of crack, at least we&#x27;ve got the Fair Sentencing Act.

6230803,comment,6229858,6230664,49,0,mkjones,,,"OK - so I work on a security team at Facebook and sometimes help with reviewing Whitehat reports. To be clear, we fixed this bug on Thursday.  The OP is correct that we should have asked for additional repro instructions after his initial report.  Unfortunately, all he submitted was a link to the post he&#x27;d already made (on a real account whose consent he did not have - violating our ToS and responsible disclosure policy), saying that &quot;the bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users&quot;.  Had he included the video initially, we would have caught this much more quickly.<p>For background, as a few other commenters have pointed out, we get hundreds of reports every day. Many of our best reports come from people whose English isn&#x27;t great - though this can be challenging, it&#x27;s something we work with just fine and we have paid out over $1 million to hundreds of reporters. However, many of the reports we get are nonsense or misguided, and even those (if you enter a password then view-source, you can access the password! When you submit a password, it&#x27;s sent in the clear over HTTPS!) provide some modicum of reproduction instructions. We should have pushed back asking for more details here.<p>However, the more important issue here is with how the bug was demonstrated using the accounts of real people without their permission. Exploiting bugs to impact real users is not acceptable behavior for a white hat. We allow researchers to create test accounts here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/accounts/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/accounts/</a> to help facilitate responsible research and testing. In this case, the researcher used the bug he discovered to post on the timelines of multiple users without their consent.<p>As you can see at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/whitehat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/whitehat</a>, in order to qualify for a payout you must &quot;make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations&quot; and &quot;use a test account instead of a real account when investigating bugs. When you are unable to reproduce a bug with a test account, it is acceptable to use a real account, except for automated testing. Do not interact with other accounts without the consent of their owners.&quot;  Unfortunately, the OP did neither of those things.  We welcome and will pay out for future reports from him (and anyone else!) if they&#x27;re found and demonstrated within these guidelines.",1376782683

I don&#x27;t know anything specific about Astoria Village, but if rich people want to live there (and presumably they do, or else the real estate developers who wanted to build there were incompetent), then they&#x27;ll move in one way or another. And with historic Astoria being relatively low-density, they&#x27;ll displace the existing residents by bidding up rent prices. Unless there&#x27;s a bunch of new construction.<p>I have no doubt that there are buildings that are of enough historical importance that they shouldn&#x27;t be demolished to build high rises (i.e. that marginal bit of rent pressure is worth it). I also don&#x27;t know if in this particular case -- especially given that they weren&#x27;t completed due to a housing crash -- building high rises ended up being wise; sometimes developers are foolish or shit just happens. And perhaps those things really are all that happened in Astoria; I couldn&#x27;t say. My point, though, still holds in the general case and certainly holds for something the size of NYC as a whole: preserving historical buildings is fundamentally in tension with preventing gentrification. It&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>(And it&#x27;s a bit of an odd one too: the people who care and should care the most about the historic value of a neighborhood are the people who actually live there. But if constrained housing supply forces them to move, they won&#x27;t be around to enjoy it anyway.)<p>This is a big issue for me because this exact conversation is happening in my neighborhood in Cambridge, MA, which keeps very strong control over new construction. Rent is skyrocketing with people like me moving in to a poorer minority neighborhood because it&#x27;s nice and we like it. Developers see that as a market opportunity and the city should see it as a signal to allow more construction to reduce rents. But many (most?) of the residents oppose new construction on the grounds that it will change the neighborhood&#x27;s feel and, incorrectly, that it will cause gentrification. It will certainly do the former, but it will help prevent the latter.",1376781464

The most joyous times were found simply being with friends and family with no presumptions of <i>better-ness</i> because you knew how much their horse cost. There were times to be alone too.<p>Today its hyper-information, hyper-jobs, hyper-success, hyper-sugary foods.<p>And what is success? What is living? Why is there <i>one</i> ice-cream stop in every town instead of every town having its own ice-cream shop? This new generation wants to understand themselves and how they fit within the spaces they frequent. They don&#x27;t want to <i>live</i> inside a commercial anymore.",1376781062

It&#x27;s one of the many ways to find yourself exploited today.\nContributing back to the community is a good thing, but only do it if you&#x27;re getting some benefit from it. Does spending your money and time for other people give you some business advantage? Help establish your reputation? Pay you back in return? Tickle your morality and make you happy? Cool, then go for it.\nBut think twice before contributing your time or money for somebody else for free. Chances are they are getting one of those tangible benefits from it, and if you&#x27;re not, well, what does that make you?<p>Yep, pretty much agree.<p>> (the above is satire, with purpose of criticism)<p>Oh...",1376780976

Perhaps the city is overpaying, but $100/night is hardly as grotesque as your original $400/night. Finally, in a city with 1.5 million rental apartments, I very much doubt that a few hundred apartments leased by the city for the homeless on the upper west side has contributed to massive hikes in rent across the city.<p>If you want to blame anything for high market rents blame rent control and rent stabilization.

What is some of this &quot;quite a lot&quot; of knowledge that sheds light on the questions at hand? It would be great to have new references.<p><i>&quot;code size&quot; is an awful metric</i><p>This has come up on HN before and the evidence does not support what you&#x27;re saying. The gold standard in recent work [1] found that more complicated metrics have no value beyond simple program length: &quot;After controlling for size none of the metrics we studied were associated with fault-proneness anymore.&quot;<p><i>it&#x27;s about as verifiable and confirmed as cyclomatic complexity is</i><p>Do you mean they&#x27;re both awful? Actually, if what you say is literally true, it follows by Occam that cyclomatic measurements are worthless, since they are far more complicated and no more valuable than the most trivial metric there is.<p>The studies may be weak and often old, but at least there <i>is</i> a body of evidence around this, and the body of evidence points reasonably consistently to the conclusion that code size is (a) the best measurement of complexity that we have, and (b) the best predictor of error rates. (The only other one I know of that has repeatedly been verified is code inspections, and that&#x27;s a process not a metric.) Contradictory evidence is welcome.<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s a debate around how best to measure code size. But that&#x27;s a separate question. That also has received some pretty high-quality discussion on HN in the past--see the link below.

6230693,comment,6228766,6228766,1,0,RougeFemme,,,"2 things have always worked for me - well almost: 1) listing out the tasks and sub-tasks required for a particular project and crossing them out as I complete them. Then, when I feeling particularly morose about accomplishing &quot;nothing&quot;, I check out my list with crossed-out tasks and realize I&#x27;ve completed something after all. Timing/sprints don&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll work on a particular task/sub-task until I&#x27;ve reached a good stopping point or until I&#x27;m feeling burnt out or I&#x27;m bored out of my skull. (Actually, as I&#x27;m writing this, I realize Pomodor or something similar is something I should consider for those boring, but necessary grunt tasks.) 2) When I realize I&#x27;m actually at or close to completion (and sometimes adding more tasks), I think of the 80/20 rule and ask myself if I would be merely &quot;polishing the apple&quot; if I continued on that project vs. the more substantive work I could do another.\nAlso, if I &quot;complete&quot; a project and it never really gets any traction, I try to think of the lessons learned from it so that I won&#x27;t feel like the entire project was a waste of time. Admittedly, that last part can be pretty tough sometimes. . .especially if you paid a price in lack of attention on your &quot;day&quot; job, social interactions/occasions/relationships that got short shrift while you worked on the project, etc.",1376780777

419849,comment,419460,419745,0,0,shimon,,,"Thanks! That's a pretty thorough reply, and I have to agree that it's hard to imagine an easier way to deploy new server instances than copying a VM.  I think you can get pretty darn close with a package system like DEB or RPM, but in terms of being able to bring up and test an environment on a development machine, and then be assured the same environment will work exactly the same in production, this is a reassuring approach.  I think it makes a lot of sense if you are expecting to require rapid scaling at some point in the future.<p>I'm a little unsure why you wouldn't just use EC2 in that case, although it might make sense to use a dedicated box for as long as you can and supplement that with EC2 instances when appropriate.  Obviously you can get a lot of EC2-instance-equivalents out of a 16-core 32gb box, and your approach would likely be easy to integrate with EC2 when the time comes.<p>I'm not sure what your load trends look like, but if you're not likely to surpass what your dedicated server can handle within the next few months, this would seem like overengineering.  I know you said it ""ruins encapsulation"" and makes a ""clusterfuck of a server"" but I don't quite see it.  If this is a web app running on a modern gnu/linux distro, with maybe some DNS and cron jobs and email and blogs, we're talking about a very common setup that's running successfully on zillions of boxes.  On the other hand, two or three times in five years I have had buggy Apache modules bring down a machine by leaking processes, and it would have been nice if that didn't take e.g. email down with it.<p>I think my biggest reservation about your approach is that it's weird.  It's basically hand-made custom EC2, right?  Is there an open source project somewhere to package up the tools to do this on one's own servers?  (If not, maybe you should start one... :)",1231120785

419844,comment,419707,419707,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The risk is that the world will change around you in the meantime and make what you're working on irrelevant.<p>My two previous employers were both started in 2001, in terms of the idea and not the corporate entity.  Last I heard, they are both still around, though in one case a founder let the company fold and then ran off to China with the IP to start again with cheap labor.  But the ideas are increasingly irrelevant now.<p>In one case, the product was software to tunnel through firewalls.  Most recent products just build that into the product itself now (witness: FogCreek CoPilot, AIM, anonymous proxies), using essentially the same technology we were working on 8-9 years ago (FogCreek calls it the Reflector) so there is less need for a general solution.<p>In the other case, the product started out as a desktop quant analytics interface.  But then around 2002-2004, everything switched to the web.  They did too, but they fell off the leading edge of technology: other firms now have much more web expertise than they do.  And now with the financial crisis, I'd guess that people are increasingly suspicious of quant analytics.<p>I keep thinking about whether it's better to go for breadth or depth (in anything, not just startups).  The answer always seems ""Go for depth, <i>as long as you're going deep into the right thing</i>.""  But it's often not possible to tell what the right thing is until you've gone deep into it.  By then, of course, you've already sunk a lot of effort into exploring the territory.  Maybe that's why people ascribe so much of success to pure luck.",1231120683

Brands are so valuable that companies fight to protect them.<p>There are many kinds of businesses that exploit faults in the public and market, yet don't even have any relationship with branding. Companies have better resources and access to more information about the areas they function in than the public does (whether as individuals or groups), and many businesses don't market to the public at all, even if they deal with the public. Debt collection firms, for example, have all of these features.<p>The public does have a mechanism to counteract the actions of companies, and that's representative government and regulation.

419834,comment,419575,419691,0,0,jerf,,,"The other thing I'd add is that if you're interested in this as a serious endeavor and not just for show, you need to take some time and analyze your expenditures first. Just like optimizing code, you need to go get the low hanging fruit before you start fiddling around the edges.<p>Buying a 2-liter and a reusable glass isn't worth much if your lead foot is costing you $200 extra a month in gas.<p>(Incidentally, I'm not tossing in the ""just like optimizing code"" thing as a sop to the audience; the optimization loop 1. Find biggest problem 2. Solve biggest problem 3. Repeat as needed (and no more) is generally useful in many situations.)<p>Analysis will almost certainly reveal some expenditures and things that are surprisingly expensive, but will probably also show there are some niceties that don't actually have anywhere near as much impact as you might think at first.

Thanks WebFaction!<p>If you are a start-up that doesn't have serious SysAdmin talent on-board, the only logical call is to outsource every machine possible. Even if you are ludicrously good hackers, you need to have a true Linux money, who isn't needed elsewhere coding, to consider not outsourcing web and email hosting. And you should back-up anything important on your personal computers to a managed box.<p>I really can't say how deeply I believe this. I've worked with multiple start-ups, and the minute you start trying to host your own website, do your own backups, serve your own emails - you're asking for trouble. Even if you set up everything right, just the time dealing with the computers could be better spent changing the world<p>Whatever you do, don't host actual email boxes in house.

419821,comment,419012,419767,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Most people are not you. :)  In fact, it might be that you aren't really like this except while dispassionately considering things after the fact: I know that I, personally, like nothing more when I'm angry or depressed than to continue to be angry or depressed, and there's an emotional bonus if I can feel justified in my anger or depression.  Someone (Sandra Tayler, I believe) once said that you can't argue someone out of being upset; the best you can accomplish by arguing is to make them also feel stupid for feeling upset.<p>For most people, ""explained why I was wrong to feel insulted"" could go either way.  If the friend explained that he hadn't meant to offend, then it might be that the upset would go away.  This is a win for the relationship, but as the argument just evaporates, there's no win or loss for either party (unless you can manage to feel like a winner anyway, I guess).  If he pointed out that you'd totally blown this out of proportion, and if you'd only paid attention / thought about it / cared enough, then you'd not have felt insulted, then this could easily seem like a loss for you, and a win for him.<p>In my (sadly, ended) marriage, it seemed rare that an argument we had was really about what the words were about, though I often didn't know until later what the argument had really been started by.  Arguments seemed pretty rare, though, and only at the end did I find out that she thought we'd argued all the time, and that I never budged or was willing to lose an argument.  Had I known we were having these arguments (which seemed like discussions to me), I could have easily arranged to lose enough of them to keep the balance -- it wasn't that I wanted to win; I just didn't understand she was losing.  Hence my statement about either winning or losing arguments too much putting strain on a relationship.  All this stuff seems clearer from a distance, to me. :/",1231119207

419819,comment,419460,419778,0,0,tdavis,,,"Well, there are a few considerations here (all of this is in reference to Softlayer, whom we use):<p>- Depending on your storage requirements, 2 drives + RAID 1 (which is more of a convenience than anything and I almost never recommend getting) is often times more expensive than an iSCSI LUN which is far superior and offers zero-setup cross-country replication and snapshots (if we're going to pretend that RAID 1 is some kind of backup solution).<p>- When ordering, if you choose the lowest clock speed CPUs, you're practically guaranteed to get the highest rated (more expensive ones) for free. This is either due to scarcity of low-end CPUs or Softlayer loves me. I have ordered numerous boxes from them and this has always been the case.<p>- They always have ""specials"" which are usually pretty ridiculous. For instance, 16 of the 32GB of RAM we have was free, as in beer. Right now (and most of the time) they have free double RAM <i>and</i> HDD. Kiss the cost of one of those RAID drives away.<p>- There are non-monetary considerations, such as support. Softlayer has without a doubt the best technical support I have ever been provided, and I've been through countless hosts in my tenure. We're talking about an <i>Unmanaged</i> host that has better techs than any Managed host I've come across. Not to mention conveniences such as automated OS reloads, private network, inter-DC OC3 backbones, VPN, secure backups, optional CDN, etc. (AWS has most of these afaik, minus VPN, but this goes to equivalence)<p>- Your 4-core server, if you don't make use of deals, would likely be equivalent to AWS. Once you start getting into high core-counts, that changes fast. As a huge proponent of parallelization, many of the processes run for TicketStumbler make use of multiple CPUs; this means a lot of what we do is CPU-bound, thus the need for higher core counts.<p>- 2TB of bandwidth is included; I also have no idea how this affects the cost overall. Edit: I added a couple TB of transfer to the AWS calculator, plus 80GB of storage: $854.10 per Extra Large. The difference in cost between this and our machine now amounts to nearly nothing.<p>So, at the end of the day, the hardware we have is nearly identical in cost (within $100, IIRC) to the Extra Large Linux instance you reported, while having twice the number of CPU cores and twice the amount of RAM. We're also afforded all the other luxuries that come with the myriad services and support the conventional dedicated host provides.<p>The dedicated hosting environment also allows me to setup and administer the hardware in the method I described in my previous reply; i.e., I don't have to setup a single Extra Large Instance (well, technically two) to handle a dozen different jobs.<p>Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",1231119196

While I was living there, I couldn't imagine how anyone could be an intellectual and not live in a city.  I eventually had to move away, however.  Living in a large city took too much effort and the crime and violence was pretty overwhelming.  (I was working as an ER nurse).<p>Now, I'm in my 30's, living in the Valley and loving it.  It seems to have hit (for me) a sweet spot of livability and intellectual stimulation.",1231117853

In our case, we found that the only way you could actually get the EPA interested in auditing your facility was if you used our software to file your paperwork.  The Agency was interested in finding out how accurate our software was, so the end result was that our customers got picked on.<p>Meanwhile, businesses that simply ignored the regulations or sent back the paperwork incomplete were let slide.<p>In short, I'd check to make sure that you are solving a real problem with real consequences.  In my experience, Environmental for the Small Business doesn't have any enforcement, and is thus not a real problem for which people will pay money.",1231117245

While we do want to store, for example, an entire e-commerce order in a single operation we also don't necessarily want to retrieve it that way.  That type of storage makes otherwise simple operations considerably more difficult.  Do you want to know how much you made in sales today?  How many of widget #453 are still in stock?  The most popular items for sale?  The least popular?  Start writing code.<p>The other example of a user profile seems to be the perfect fit for storage in a single table, so I don't why that's there.  Now, do you want to know how many users logged in this week?  How about you want to delete every account that hasn't been accessed in a year?  Much more slow code.<p>Every article about NoSQL goes on and on about the supposed advantages, but rarely talks about the considerable disadvantages.  And honestly, for most people, the advantages are simply not worth the trade off.  I fear that we'll have decades of e-commerce stores written with document stores and mountains of code slowly chugging away to calculate the basic stats that any business needs.",1266450693

If there are competitor applications, you can compete against them, not the 100k irrelevant apps that are not in that niche. If you have a good UI, that's a big separator between you and the pack. The Gaia GPS look always struck me as being a bit too gameish, sci-fi/hi-tech. This one is simpler and better but still a little unfriendly. I would prefer a simpler start screen (just parked car, find my parked car), rather than a map. I think the GaiaGPS team will learn a lot by refining this app to the mainstream.",1266450177

What happens when MasterCard suddenly can't access the balance of its creditees anymore? What happens when you need your social security check? What happens when you need money from a bank? Who's tracking stocks? How are you going to get all your important emails, or your contacts, or your off-site financial records from company x? All these processes are not trivially related to the internet; they depend on it in a way that cannot just be ""fixed"". Make not mistake, our financial system is completely and 100% dependent on internet, and if you take it away, there will be a complete disaster. Sure, some of it will eventually get where it needs to go, but some of it won't. And some of that information you need NOW.<p>I'll say it again: without the internet, these processes FREEZE. And that's just the effects that don't involve the lack of ability to communicate. Here are some more:<p>Google is worth $154 billion. That's one company alone. There are lots of companies, lots of small business that are purely internet companies. I'd say, what, a couple trillion dollars worth just in the valley alone? What happens when the internet disappears? They are all suddenly useless. Maybe it doesn't sound like a big deal, but there is a LOT of money tied up in those companies. Not only would investors lose basically all money (and thus, losing their ability to leverage more bets, etc., depending on how deep they were in), the companies that were banking on those companies to buy things would lose money. And many, many more companies would lose time and energy due to vastly decreased productivity related to not being able to get those products in as fast a manner as the internet allows.<p>Then there's the fact that there is a lot of valuable information stored on the internet. What happens when MasterCard suddenly can't access the balance of its creditees anymore? Who's going to absorb that debt? You? What happens when you need your social security check? What happens when you need money from a bank?<p>It's no secret that e-commerce is big business in the US. Even a lot of businesses that are relatively small do e-commerce a lot of times, so you also have to count the fact that all their investments are sunk, too. Then there's the cost of the lost business that brought them, which they may have been banking on. Then there's the fact that, again, they can't get goods as fast as they used to because the efficient means of communication are gone.<p>Then there are the international implications, which means you can take all of what's said up there, and cross-apply the affects to them, as well as how those effects will affect us.<p>Oh, and I still haven't discussed the fact that you benefit more than you even know from information accessibility. For the last 10+ years, you've been slowly teaching yourself that you don't need to memorize everything because you have the internet. What happens when you need all those facts, but now they're gone? What happens when reporters don't have access to those facts? What happens when vital government organizations don't have access to those facts? And it's not just you: our entire society is built around this accessibility of information. Without it, we are blind.<p>So yes, the internet is integral to our way of living, and in fact, the way of living of the world as a whole. If you cannot see that, you need to exit the tech sector immediately.",1266448945

I find this purchase particularly interesting as Google is often noted for buying companies solely for their employees.<p>1.  They're currently in the red.<p>2.  VP6, their only successful product in recent years, is obsolete.<p>3.  Neither VP7 nor VP8 is competitive with the best H.264 encoders, nor do they have the clout to get hardware implementations out there.  They will serve--at best--as niche formats, like Bink.  VP7 got practically no adoption--the only notable licensee I know of is Skype video chat.  As VP8 is basically just a faster, pared-down VP7, I doubt it will do much more for them.<p>Most importantly, proprietary video and audio formats are simply hard to pitch nowadays.  Nobody wants to use file formats that depend entirely on the implementations and support of a single company; it's simply too risky.  The only proprietary format I can think of that still has wide adoption for reasons other than legacy is Bink, due to the low licensing costs, good reputation, top-quality tools, and cross-platform availability.  And, of course, the fact that games are usually release-once-and-forget products, maybe with a few bugfix patches on the side.<p>(Note ""professional"" video and audio stuff is its own world, and has a huge variety of almost-entirely-proprietary stuff, like ProRes, etc.)<p>4.

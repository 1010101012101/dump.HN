Sure, there are some ads, but is it noticeable in desktop/mobile Twitter apps? Even third party apps that use the Twitter API? The same principal stands for Craigslist - it's hard to compete with free by offering ""customer trust."" I don't think there's much value in customer trust compared to free software where  I know I can't complain if it goes down. Now, if I used App.net professionally in the sense that I cannot ever have my notifications go down, I might do it, but then again, there are so many social networks that the odds of both Facebook and Twitter (the two largest ones in the US that I can think of) will be down at the same time.<p>Still, good luck to him.",1342241463

I think you'll be surprised at how impressive they are.<p>I understand why it's hard to get people to believe this, but it's absolutely insane how hard it is to convince people of this. I've seen more and more people floored at Jelly Bean. They watched the demo video and are amazed at how nice it looks and how slick it is. I don't have the heart to tell them that Honeycomb was 50% of the way there (Between Froyo and JB) and that ICS was... 99.9% of the way there. There are hardly any visual changes outside of the ""Project Butter"" between ICS and JB and yet all the people are acting like JB is this big visual refresh.<p>Don't get me wrong Project Butter uped the ante, but not that much. It's as smoother or smoother than the iPhone, but ICS was nearly there. The 60Hz vsync just made it that much nicer. Plus, none of that 2002-2003-esque skeuomorphism.

Yes, open source means that even your competitors can use it.  But there's quite a software difference between Amazon's version and Jelly Bean while the cost of the Fire vs. the Nexus 7 is $0.  I don't think Google's too concerned about Amazon's ""forceful"" fork.<p>I don't see Google having problems matching Amazon on its price.  The difference is that if updated properly, Google's Android will always give a better experience.  If you aren't tied to Amazon Instant, why would you NOT go w/ the Nexus 7 over the Fire?<p>Same thing for the smartphone IMO.",1342241123

Phones do <i>not</i> use the encrypted GPS channel, they use the regular one. And spoofing it can make you phone think it is somewhere that it isn't. Cell tower data screws with that (since if you cross correlate to cell tower pings you end up with conflicting data sets) but within the range of a tower its eminently doable.

Locales of fr-CA and fr-FR worked but not en-UK or en-GB.<p>Apple has a country code, the app name and a numeric id.  But the app name is just decoration and is ignored, so you could easily mislead by putting in anything you want.  From the country code it looks like they believe only one language is spoken in any country (eg I couldn't select between French and English for Canada).  The ids aren't in numeric order - probably some sort of timestamp instead.<p>Google uses a descriptive URL without country or language parts, and then the app is identified by package name (bundle id equivalent for the iOS crowd) which looks fine to us techie folk and mostly follows being the DNS name with some extra gunk such as com.rovio.angrybirdsspace.ads<p>Amazon Android URLs are amazon.com/<App Title>/dp/<ID> where the app title is just decoration and can be changed to anything and ID is hexadecimal(ish).<p>They all have various issues.  I think locale information as part of the URI path is silly.  Titles in the URLs is nice but open up social engineering attacks.  As a techie I like the Google approach of identification, but that too is prone to social engineering (to my knowledge they do not verify a correspondence to the publishing organization DNS).  But it is prettier than random numbers.  A GUID is Microsoft's hammer and solution to everything.  In this case it just makes the URLs unnecessarily long.",1342239116

By the second year Android was outselling iPhone (which had been the fastest selling phone in history up to that point). Android was, by all reasonable measures, an explosive and rapid success. One could argue it took a few months to ""take off"", but its sales numbers have vastly outpaced Windows Phone, even from the very first months. By the time we were 21 months into the story it was obvious to anybody paying attention that Android was going to be Apple's primary competition in the smart phone market.<p>Windows Phone is a flop.

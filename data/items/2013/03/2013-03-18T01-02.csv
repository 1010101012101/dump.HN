As a very regular user, I use it on multiple computers and devices during the day. Any replacement would either have to be hosted remotely (like GR) to provide synchronization, or leverage something like dropbox for the synchronization. I assumed the latter would be straightforward and something that someone had already done but found this article when I did some googling. It's obviously a pretty complex problem to solve. My thinking now is that it should be possible to maintain a filesystem database using something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir</a> to avoid the locking issues.",1363571981

But it depends on a plugin (or an app) rather than being an allwhere accessible website. Their Kindle Fire app seemed to load content extremely slowly, and its interface wasn't a simple list. And it's free, so I can't be a customer and I don't know how they earn money.<p>* NewsBlur is complicated and unresponsive. There are a lot of inscrutable unlabeled icons, and I don't understand why an arrow follows the mouse. It's a paid service - I can be a customer - but I don't know how sustainable NewsBlur will be with its current issues and with subscription as its only source of funding.<p>If NewsBlur seems solid by May, I'll gladly pay them.

There's no hard guideline to what triggers our brains to jump. It could be audible, visual, or tangentially related to the task at hand.

5391933,comment,5390456,5391910,3,0,bebefuzz,,,":) Yep. We read this too, and we loved this comment:<p>Steven Cox 22 hours ago-
The amount of margin a company can extract from the marketplace depends on a couple factors: (1) Amount of competition within the category, (2) the amount of value the company is providing that market participants are willing to pay for (example: a listing site vs. a listing site plus scheduling and billing tools), (3) the virality of the business (lower CAC = ability to charge lower fees), and (4) the presence of a recurring revenue stream (allows for lower margin per transaction).<p>No matter what margin the business decides on, the strategic decision each company must ask is how much adoption is needed today vs. the expeted margin. The higher the growth needed, the lower the fees need to be.<p>Once, I heard an early eBay Executive explain how eBay's initial low fees allowed them to run away from other early auction sites. They were priced low enough to where no one could undercut them and priced where the market contributors deemed the fees reasonable. The other sites had two options: charge less and go out of business or charge more per transaction to get the same revenue output - which caused the market contributors to seek out a lower cost solution (eBay). Game over.<p>Part art, part science... and a tank load of work.",1363571331

This is despite having more generous public sectors than the Mediterranean.<p>Nor is it simply corruption, though there's PLENTY of that to go around.

Or I search for something and a magic algorithm find me the result. As I learned more about algorithms and data-structures, that magic disappeared. Now I had the same feeling about hardware. This magic black square on the motherboard that can execute a set of couple of hundred or so assembly instructions many billions of times per second. Then I took a hardware architecture class and poof! magic disappeared. We started with transistors and build to designing our own CPU chip.<p>I am guessing something similar is going on with our understanding of the brain and mind. I think we just haven't figured out a good way to model and represent knowledge. There was terrible optimism at the end of 50s that super human AI will take over in just a decades. But it didn't happen. We have sort of been stomping our feet (I personally don't consider playing chess an AI achievement). I think there will be a breakthrough -- maybe it will be a simple organization of existing ML and knowledge representation methods (neural networks, mixed with evolutionary algorithms) or some new framework - OR - enough of very specific applications (chess playing, image recognition and speech recognition) advanced will slowly chip away at this ""magic"" AI core until maybe nothing will be left.

They subconsciously lean on the tool. They make assumptions about what kind of vulnerability the tool will find that they shouldn't waste time looking for.

But politicians can't count: they're for the most part lawyers.<p>So they build this monstrosity: the European Union.  A mad bureaucracy / technocracy where every document is translated in 27 languages (including obscure ones): small countries love it because they can send people to get jobs in Brussels at crazy high salaries.  For what?  Paperwork.  Nothing but paperwork.<p>Then they dreamed up the most stupid thing ever: a common currency (the euro) without a common fiscality.  Only stupid lawyers can come up with nonsense like this.  Economists did warn them, before the first euro even circulated, that it would end up in precisely the current situation (even the default of Greece and Spain had been forecast).<p>Nobody listened.<p>Wanna know what's coming next?  It's easy: go read what economists who predicted the current situation are saying.  They're from the Milton Friedman school of economics thought.  Keynesians lost is and lost it a long time ago.  Nothing to learn there: they never predicted anything more than a few years (two or three) before it happened.  If you want to predict 15 years+ ahead you have to read Friedman and its disciples.<p>What coming next is simple: these stupid politicians and lawyers who created all this crazy paperwork and non-sense laws are going to try anything they can, including more and more non-democratic measures, to try to save the euro.<p>But they can't save it: it's fundamentally flawed.  Countries have to get out or the entire eurozone is going to split and go back to national currencies.<p>The cost is going to be about 15% of the GDP for all the countries exiting.<p>If the euro ain't split in the few years coming we'll be going to have the BCE defaulting (the BCE basically already became a bad bank, drowning under state debt from states who are going to default) and massive civil unrest: people losing everything.<p>Here we're talking about a worldwide GDP drop of about 30%.<p>So either we bit the bullet now and take about a 15% GDP loss by going to national currencies or we try desperately to save the euro and we'll end up creating a <i>much</i> bigger problem.<p>We're witnessing history.

The only functional unit is the family or clan, and very minimal ties to higher units of a tribe -- not to the state.  Individual governors, mayors, and police chiefs rule by personal charisma and graft, and bringing their pre-existing tribal relationships in.

Couple that with the original page and icon fetches, you're looking at almost two feeds every second just to keep your feeds up to date.

But 99.9% of all patents are based on inventions already known, and those are not what is claimed. What is claimed is the inventive step above what the prior art had accomplished. If someone had a patent for 'a pen', a pen with a novel and inventive tip would be perfectly acceptable. The inventor may need to licence the use of the pen patent to commercialise their improvement, but there is sighing stopping them from getting the patent to an improved pen.

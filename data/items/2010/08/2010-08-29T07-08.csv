1643410,comment,1642503,1642804,0,0,cdavid,,,"The law (and law enforcement) system is very hard to understand for a foreigner used to western systems - maybe one of the most weird thing.<p>One of thee most surprising thing is how little respect law enforcement people get, and their total lack of authority whatsoever. The first time I was arrested with my gf (who is Japanese), I was truly shocked to see here talking back to the policeman, especially since she was clearly in the wrong (not stopping at a stop sign by car). I told here later that it was the most sure way to spend some time unpleasant time at least for the night in France (or worse in the US), and plead her to never ever do that. I also saw once a guy in plain day, in the center of Osaka, circumventing a policeman who asked him to stop, and running away by car.<p>I think this is linked to the most defining aspect of Japanese society: the perpetual social obligations to each other, and the lack of individuality. My interpretation is that law in Japan is mostly ""unused"", because people restrain themselves so much in general for every aspect of everyday life. As such people whose job is to force this on people besides social conventions are not well regarded. I would love to get a better understanding of this aspect of Japanese society.<p>Concerning low rate of crimes, I think this is partly an illusion. True, issues related to physical aggression are much less likely than in any other country I know, and the country is very safe. But there is also a covering of things which are considered as crimes in western countries. Things such as rape, sexual harassment are often covered up, I believe - certainly, I have seen more inappropriate behavior in Japan in 6 years than all my life otherwise. Corruption is also prevalent, the comparison of number of white collar crimes with other countries would be interesting, for example. Finally, many activities related to child pornography is disturbingly tolerated in Japan.",1283068655

The other was baking by herself. <i>shrug</i> Actually data <i>is</i> comprised of anecdotes and anecdotes are data, in my judgment. Life and actual experiences in the real world <i>are</i> data. Reality is data.<p>If your point is, well, this is just two little girls, you're right, that alone would not allow one to extrapolate to all little girls everywhere. However, I know for a fact that large companies and institutions have already done lots of experiments with kids (especially companies that have a vested interest in figuring out exactly what kids want, in order to maximize their profit) and my understanding is that the studies show that yes, girls mostly prefer to play with girlish things and boys with boyish things. This was the result of Science with a capital S. Now, do all boys hate dolls and all girls hate robots and dump trucks and guns? Of course not. But in the majority of cases that's how the cookie crumbled in the real world.<p>Also the whole ""pink vs blue"" thing you see in stores in the kid sections? Do you think that's some conspiracy or cultural artifact? From what I've heard, it's isn't. They've done experiments. Girls in general, world-wide, really do tend to prefer pink and boys prefer blue.

It jumbles together all/most of the the sciences (for example, would bio be tech but social science not be tech?), engineering and programming, for example. Still speaking in rough terms, but at a little higher degree of fidelity, I'd say female interest/talent/ambition in science fields is much higher than in programming, which in turn is higher than in traditional engineering (EE, mech eng, etc.) -- and even within engineering the percentages vary by specific field. So if you told me of one particular country or region or whatever where say 70% of bio science degree holders were women, that wouldn't sound too extra-ordinary to me. If you said 70% of electrical or mechanical engineers, that's different.<p>Btw, do you think society also has a problem (speaking USA) that the vast majority of cosmetics salespeople are women? Do you think there's some horrible educational/cultural/societal conspiracy or flaw going on that has caused there to be so few men in that field? And how about child day care? How about the small percentage of women that are garbage truck pickup workers? Auto mechanics? Hunters? Weightlifting?<p>I think that today in the USA we're about as close to ""culturally gender neutral"" in mathematics, science and programming as we're ever going to get without some sort of significant genetic engineering or neurological/cyborg modification. Small changes? Sure, of course. Big changes? I highly doubt it without hacking on our DNA or hormones.",1283066569

That suggests to /me/ that the gender disparity in Silicon Valley has very little to do with genetics. In fact, the role of genetics in intelligence is too heavily disputed to be considered anyhow - the tech field being a supposed /meritocracy/, and genetics having little to do with personal /merit/, it instead suggests to me that the problem is how our culture is defining ""ideal merit"" to our women.<p>The reason why tech conferences can't find enough women speakers is because there aren't enough girls encouraged /socially/ to enter the tech field. And by ""girls,"" I don't mean to use disparaging language, but indicate that the problem is rooted all the way in how they're taught and influenced, be it in schools or amongst friends and family.<p>When mathematics, science and computer programming are considered culturally gender-neutral, that's when female representation in the tech industry will be less of an issue.

There was actually 1 female there today, but the other 10+ people were males. This is extremely common. And I've never heard any participant in this hobby complain about it or point out oppression/repression/supression/conspiracy. The simple fact is that if more females wanted to play wargames, and got out  there and played them, there <i>would</i> be <i>more</i> females playing, and thus they would not be able to say they feel dissuaded by the gender ratio.<p>Arrington's point was: maybe this is the <i>natural</i> gender ratio (or very close to it, plus/minus some small percentage, however you could possibly deduce that), and the women in these cases just have to suck it up and deal. Just like a man would have to suck it up and deal if he wanted to work at a Great Clips or as a cosmetics salesman in a department store.<p>Life is not evenly homogenous in every aspect, and there isn't anything inherently insidious about that.

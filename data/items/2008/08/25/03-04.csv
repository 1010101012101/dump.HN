Here are these goofy mormonians."" I think you can pick out goofballs from any religion. My point was, ""Here is someone going to college that doesn't seem to be able to read the ingredients on their soda can.""

285626,comment,285260,285587,0,0,Oatmeat,,,"Thanks for the reply.<p>Regarding the push command, it currently does not allow both the --all and --tags options to be used together (very strange).<p>Regarding not pushing temporary branches, this seems contrary to one of the reasons I started using git: it makes branches cheap and easy to throw away when you are done with them.<p>I can understand the way git works regarding each developer using only the branches they are interested in, but I can't seem scale this philosophy down to a single developer. I want all my working copies to be the same. I want new branches to propagate. I want branch deletions to propagate.<p>I've thought about scripting some of this, but for some pieces I am not sure how to proceed. Consider branch deletion. The problem here is that I can delete the branch from the main repository, but that doesn't force deletion for each of the clients. Instead, I would need to write a custom ""git pull"" style command that I run in a working directory before I start my work. Should this command delete all remote branches so that actual deletions are propagated, and then ""git pull"" restores the remote branches which still exist?<p>[edit: I've discovered that ""git remote prune"" will delete remote tracking branches that are no longer in the repo]<p>Don't other git users have this issue? Presumably there are others who work from more than one location and want a consistent view from each, yet I can't seem to google for any help on these issues.",1219636183

285611,comment,285193,285573,0,0,sofal,,,"It does get pretty silly sometimes. There are only a few things that are ""outlawed"", and therefore people think that as long as they abstain from those substances, they're in total compliance with what their religion expects of them. The root reason of the dietary restrictions is a principle of respecting the body and keeping it clean, but people misapply it by interpreting it verbatim and then gorging themselves on junk food, soda, or anything that isn't healthy but isn't technically ""forbidden"".<p>I think it's a good thing that the church doesn't forcefully regulate which sodas we can or cannot drink, because that would be controlling and ridiculous. However, these slightly arbitrary rules can end up encouraging a group of people who do the minimum required just to remain in good social status. That will be the case anywhere.<p>Another example of this is R-rated movies. There was a church leader a long time ago who at one time at a general conference warned against viewing R-rated movies. This seems perfectly acceptable, except that it ended up creating an unwritten rule of sorts among LDS members. The principle is that we should avoid movies that don't meet the standards we're expected to have, but it inevitably created a group of people who were perfectly okay with seeing any movie regardless of the content as long as the MPAA didn't put the magic 'R' on it.<p>It's hard to know where to draw the line when you know that some people are just going to get as close to that line as possible. You just hope that most people are listening to the underlying principles rather than the base requirements.<p>I occasionally drink caffeinated sodas if there isn't anything else available. I don't consider this to be especially damaging to my health.

285609,comment,285435,285579,0,0,nonrecursive,,,">> This startup is basically just selling of your services. Here's some ideas. Start by writing whitepapers & studies of other sites. Do them for free. Just pick any known site and say what you'd do differently. Do this for a lot of them. Make a blog and do a study every day. Make a wiki with usability practices. Start recording videos of random users using some site and criticize them.<p>I didn't notice this at first.  It's very useful advice.  Some of it I've already started (writing whitepapers & studies).  My friend and I have been talking about putting together a wiki with usability practices.<p>In the mean time, I have had a few people request the service because their web developer (whom I showed the site to) recommended it to them. Hopefully word of mouth will continue to bring in business and increase my cash flow. Over time it will be great to build my credibility in the ways you mention. In the short term, it's also pretty important to me to start gaining paying business.",1219634038
285608,comment,285097,285249,0,0,maximilian,,,"I worked it out this afternoon, and its not too terribly difficult to get a nice closed form solution (as opposed to a recursive (or iterative one).  Its mostly a bit of geometry with some cleverness moving things around to get a nice closed form solution.  The only advanced math is a geometric series that comes up at the end, which gives the final fully closed form solution for the length of the paper given a thickness, initial length, and the number of folds.  It becomes easy then to solve for an initial length  for a number of desired folds.<p>The fact that she was in high school when she did this though, is impressive.  Any teacher with a bit of calculus would have been able to guide her though, once he saw where she was headed.",1219633875

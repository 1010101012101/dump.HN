There are many basic low level issues that surface no matter how high level is the language you are using, I am not advocating teaching assembly to beginners, but a language like C and issues like:<p>- Direct addressing vs. indirect adressing, aka storing a value vs storing an address, aka pointers vs. values, aka call-by-value vs call-by-reference, ... Beginning programmers brought up on very high level languages are endlessly confused by the difference between copying the value and copying the reference.<p>- Understanding the stack and how procedure calls work. It might then be easier to understand why tail recursion in functional languages is cool but non-tail recursion not so much.<p>- Basic memory management.

We only allow ALIASes to data that we know about authoritatively; so with Route 53 you can ALIAS to an S3 website Bucket (which also lets you do HTTP redirects), a CloudFront distribution (which can serve as a bridge to any arbitrary domain you may care), an ELB or to other records in your zone (which lets you combine routing policies in a compositional way).<p>The main benefits are;<p><pre><code>   No dependency on a third party DNS service, we stand behind our 100% SLA\n \n   DNS-based routing policies still work correctly\n\n   No delay in responding to health check failures\n</code></pre>\nbut there&#x27;s another (future, for us) ancillary benefit too;<p><pre><code>   Compatibility with offline-signed DNSSEC\n</code></pre>\nThe big downside of course is that the record has to be in our system in order to ALIAS to it. For HTTP services, using CloudFront is a pretty good workaround, it can handle dynamic and static sites. If you merely want to redirect from your apex to your www. domain, then S3 with a redirect works great too.<p>We&#x27;re also open to enabling ALIASing to other zones hosted in Route 53 on a case by case basis. If you have a multi-tenant service and you&#x27;re managing (or willing to manage) a zone on Route 53 with something like [customer-or-resource-identifier].yourservicename.com we can enable ALIASing to those names. If you&#x27;re interested, get in touch via the limit increase process; <a href""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_lim...</a> .<p>Obvious question: Why don&#x27;t we enable ALIASing across zones by default?  Firstly, zones which can be aliased to have to be replicated and available in all shards of our partitioned datastore (some day we may use some kind of cross-shard query protocol to resolve that, but even then we&#x27;d prefer to minimize the traffic) and secondly we want to ensure some stability for ALIAS targets and avoid situations where targets may be discontinued or deleted by their owners leaving our mutual customers stranded.",1389196220

The code would likely be terrible with 100 newbies to Java all hacking in their own required feature to the detriment of everyone else. That would drive the lesson home quick!",1389195329
7024078,comment,7023650,7023650,28,0,stiff,,,"To me there seems to be something wrong with using as the first language something that depends on a very, very complicated runtime and execution model to run on the hardware we currently are using. This way people end up viewing programming languages as some God-given black box and not just something another computer program written by another person provides for you.<p>I think CS students should instead start by learning basics of computer architecture at a high level and programming on a level close to the computer architecture that so far has turned out to be practical, the Von Neumann machine. This way they can understand the whole field better, if you never face the challenges of organizing computations in a computer without many existing layers of abstractions designed by other people, you will never understand the development of the field and how the disciplines of algorithms, operating systems, computer architecture, etc came to be the way they are, too many things are taken for granted by people who have only seen very high level languages.<p>People should know what the stack is, how function calls works, what is an assembler, what linked lists, binary trees, hash maps, ... are and why those had to be invented etc. I think something at the level of Go or C is best for that. Then I think a good moment comes for a course like SICP where people can learn how to take those pieces and build abstraction layers out of them.",1389195325

I used, without noticing, many techniques I would later have relearn due to a &quot;prolongued exposure to imperative programming&quot;. In my semester I used closures, functions as first class objects and lots of recursion.<p>The following three semesters I forgot all that, for I had to use C, C++ and Java. When, in the fourth semester, I had my AI course in Lisp, I used &quot;let&quot;s and loops for everything. In the middle of the semester, I remembered recursion, and how it made everything better (in Lisp). Later, by myself, I relearned closures, functions as first-class-objects and other stuff.<p>Having Scheme as an introductory language is good because it put students that came from a IT-technical high-school education equal to general high-school education students (that have never seen programming before). With the &quot;real world&quot; so drowned in imperative programming languages, there are few courses that can justify using a functional programming language. The things I know about FP, I know because I thought myself.<p>I&#x27;m not saying FP is better than imperative programming, is just that both should be (well) taught.

One of the big reasons mentioned was that Java&#x27;s just too big and hairy of a language.  They end up spending all their time teaching API quirks and software engineering principles (such as pretty much the entire subject of OOP), leaving little time to focus on much more important basic skills such as breaking a problem into smaller pieces and attacking a problem in an organized manner.  Or even simple stuff, like the difference between a value and a variable.  They also lamented the loss of a REPL, which is an invaluable tool for enabling (and encouraging) students to experiment and get a better understanding of how a programming language actually works.<p>For my own part, I wonder if the current cultural unfashionability of OOP isn&#x27;t somehow a result of the vogue for switching CS programs over to Java around the turn of the century.

For me, at least, you&#x27;d need to go all the way down to individual neighborhoods to show that &quot;a significant majority of the United States&#x27; suffers from an extremely high murder rate&quot;.<p>Let me illustrate. The murder rate in Washington, DC is pretty high, at 13.9 per 100,000 (which I&#x27;ll abbreviate as just 13.9 from here).<p>I live in the DC area. Does that mean that I live in an area with an extremely high murder rate? Nope. I live in Fairfax County, about 15 miles from downtown, but still well within the urban area. At first glance, Fairfax County is a collection of suburbs. However, this is kind of misleading, as the county has almost double the population of DC proper, about 1.1 million people. In 2011 (the most recent year I could find a figure for), there were 11 murders in Fairfax County, putting the murder rate at just under 1.0. That makes Fairfax County on par with or safer, on average, than every Australian state besides Tasmania.<p>And this isn&#x27;t cherry-picked, aside from the obvious bit where I started out with it because I live here. neighboring Arlington County, for example, with a population of about 220,000, had no murders in 2011. Montgomery County had 16 murders in 2011 out of a population of about one million, for a somewhat higher murder rate of 1.6.<p>There is substantial variation within each jurisdiction as well. Large parts of DC is perfectly safe, with murders concentrated in certain areas:<p><a href=""http://apps.washingtonpost.com/investigative/homicides/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.washingtonpost.com/investigative/homicides/</a><p>If you live in the northwest part of the city, you&#x27;re perfectly safe. If you live in southeast, life is even more dangerous than the 13.9 average rate suggests.<p>DC is a somewhat special case, as a large urban area carved up into many jurisdictions. Other major US cities tend to have fewer local jurisdictions, which makes it harder to see the individual regions. Chicago, for example, has a population of 2.7 million within the city limits and that encompasses a huge range in terms of crime, from places where you&#x27;d never want to get out of your car to places that haven&#x27;t seen a murder in years.<p>Yes, the US has more violent crime than other first-world countries, but it doesn&#x27;t much apply to the average person. Much of this crime is criminal-on-criminal violence, and much of the rest is concentrated in poor and minority areas. That&#x27;s not to excuse it <i>at all</i>, or to somehow imply that it makes it OK, but it is <i>relevant</i> when addressing what most of the country sees.",1389195085

Corruption is similar - and the effects in some economies are quite devastating, even though the individual bribes might not be that expensive. Big effects can arise from small individual inconveniencees.<p>But I also think that much of the risk lies in the future, with improved analysis algorithms. I think a reasonable model to assume is one of computers that can think and learn similarly to a human, just with much higher input bandwidth for simple facts and a bit limited free reasoning ability. That assumption may go a bit to far, but I think it&#x27;s still a much better model than thinking of it as an improved spreadsheet. Look, for example, at google translate - that is in essence a computer learning the translation between languages from humans, without actually being taught anything explicitly. It&#x27;s no big magic, and yet the results are quite good overall.<p>And private companies aren&#x27;t the only ones playing that game, of course, the NSA has a similar power dynamic, and the borders aren&#x27;t all that clear anyhow, of course, as any data piles that private companies hold tend to also attract intelligence agencies and the like.<p>But let me try and show some concrete examples of where personal information is or could be used in order to gain power:<p>In the political arena, I think that gerrymandering is a good example: Parties use known correlations between personal information they know and voting behaviour in order to increase their chances of winning the election (instead of making the election as representative as possible, which would make a functioning democracy).<p>Or a company could primarily fire people who have predispositions for certain illnesses that could reduce their efficiency later on or they could right from the beginning only hire those who are not affected. If the pool of workers is large enough, that reduces costs. And as a company needs to be competitive, it actually might not even be able to avoid it once competitors start such a practice.<p>Similarly for insurance companies: From the perspective of the insurance company, their financial goal in a competitive market is to get rid of any customers that will cost them more money than they pay, so whatever data they are able to get their hands on, they probably will try to use for predictions, and as above they will be forced to do so once some competitor does it. From the perspective of society as a whole, though, insurance is particularly important for those expensive cases, as that stabilizes the social structure, while an insurance industry that only insures people who don&#x27;t need an insuracnce is essentially worthless for society.<p>Or suppose a totalitarian leader gets elected. No easier way to make sure that noone challenges your power than to rank the social graph of your country by number of edges and putting in jail anyone who is too well-connected. One important historical case of this type was after Nazi Germany had invaded the Netherlands, where they had all the census information on Hollerith punch cards, including a person&#x27;s religion.

How often do teachers change a grade because parents call in, or because the student complains? Too often. Whether it&#x27;s from parents or the institution, there are a lot of outside factors that pressure teachers to give good grades even when they are not deserved.<p>No matter which way you put it, getting a bad grade always hurts, especially when good grades are being given in other classes. I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons that teachers who are &quot;tougher&quot; are looked down upon. People think they&#x27;re mean, but sometimes they&#x27;re just being honest and want you to succeed so much that they wouldn&#x27;t dare give you a grade that doesn&#x27;t reflect your actual progress. For the same reason, teachers don&#x27;t want to have this label, so they resort to being &quot;easier&quot; and less honest.<p>This certainly happens at the high school and middle school level, but recent news has looked at grading practices at Harvard.

It was pleasant, but we have been behind. However, I believe you can have high expectations without being jerk about it.<p>But:<p>0.) Practice is not the same as rote learning especially in math above third grade. Practice in math means that you have to solve many different exercises and occasionally having to come up with solutions by yourself. Practice in math means that you are occasionally faced with exercises you have not seen before and you have to logic-think your way out of that.<p>Rote learning is quite opposite of that. Drilling essentially the same exercises over and over is opposite of that too.<p>Incidentally, those international tests try to confront students with unfamiliar situations and measure how they perform there.<p>1.) Why is everybody so obsessed with multiplication tables? It is something 6-7 years old have to learn. I just doubt that whatever happened in the first grade is all that much important years later on when you are 16 years old (age those international tests are done).<p>Even if you had worst first grade teacher in the world that did not taught you how much 2+2 is, teacher in fourth grade was supposed to force you to learn that. How come it did not happened?<p>2.) Is it possible that while super tough teacher in the beginning could be great for talented committed students, but not really match for average one? Only student with huge commitment and talent would persist and all others would gave up.<p>I was such average kid in music, hated that and stopped playing as soon as I could. It is quite possible that if I would find at least something enjoyable on lessons, I would learn more.<p>Of course, it does not really matter whether I play music today. But, it would matter if I would learn to hate math or computers the same way as I hated music practice.",1389193246

In a utopia, the decision maker might be the smartest, wisest person alive, with a nigh god-like ability to discern what&#x27;s best for everyone. In reality, the decision maker is just a regular Joe. Worse, in democracies like the US and UK -- where potential leaders seem to primarily be chosen solely on the basis of social class (when did you last see a genuinely lower class politico?) -- there is absolutely no reason to believe that the leader has cognitive abilities that are above those of the population.<p>In a utopia, a paternalist system would work because the decisions made by the pater would be better than those made by the populace. In reality, it results in USSR supermarkets stuffed with canned tomatoes because the ever-wise pater wasn&#x27;t even able to predict people&#x27;s most basic wants.",1389193217

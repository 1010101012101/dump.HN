51734,comment,51616,51656,0,0,mdakin,,,"""Competition"" may or may not take care of the problem.  As imgabe points out the market for high-speed internet connections is an oligopoly.  Depending on the specific scenario an oligopoly can be almost as efficient as a free market (competition is taking care of problems) or almost as inefficient as an unregulated monopoly (competition is not taking care of problems).  <p>A non-neutral network is one possible outcome of an inefficient oligopoly structure of the high-speed internet connection market.  If we want to avoid that inefficiency it behooves us to at least threaten regulation of the market.  Hopefully the threat will be enough but if not then regulation becomes more of a requirement if one is concerned with economic efficiency.<p>Remember the POTS network was built-out using a government-sponsored monopoly (AT&T).  If such an unwieldily structure could bring copper wires out to every rural farmhouse in the country surely the ""free market"" will be able to provide high-speed internet connections just as universally without having to resort to inefficient extortion of high-tech companies.<p>",1189180125

51730,comment,51451,51451,0,0,jey,,,"- Yes, it takes a C++ expert to do C++ well. If you aren't an expert, you're going to screw it up. You'll either get mired in what I call ""Fancy C++ Voodoo Magic"" by over designing your code and doing weird template meta-programming without any real goal or just use the wrong idioms, or forget about some random subtleties.<p>- Sometimes you really do need to write systems software. In these instances, I'm still going to use C++. I won't claim that C++ is a great language, but at the end of the day, the  benefits provided by C++ make it worth it. It would just be more footwork in C. Classes, RAII, STL, templates, type-safety are all worth it. But this is because I have already made all the mistakes and written lots of bad C++ that I'm now able to write clean, simple and elegant C++. I'd advise a newbie programmer against becoming a C++ expert. It's not worth the time and effort to learn all the stupid cases and to learn when to use which feature and to what degree to avoid falling into the swamp of C++. It's worth knowing C++ well enough that you can hack systems code though. I wouldn't say ""only learn C and not C++ for systems hacking!""",1189179370

51721,comment,51451,51672,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"The times you are likely going to be able to beat STL is if you:<p>1) Have a highly specific algorithm where you know your memory characteristics very well, or<p>2) You are doing lots of memory allocation/deallocation. For example, something like vector<vector<myclass>> will be nasty in STL.<p>Outside of that though it will be difficult. STL was designed with speed as the foremost objective. It is simply very hard to beat in MOST tasks (but not ALL). For example, Vectors dont do any bounds checking. Most STL vectors will have performance on par with a simple dynamically allocated array. Iterators are also not validated before accessing a container.<p>So I wont say they cant be beat. They certainly can. But how much is your time worth? I guess it depends on your objectives and how critical every ounce of speed is. I understand there are probably situations with some where this type of thing is life or death.",1189178478

And working hard will probably get you that money faster than not working hard.<p>Finally, your claim about the people whose ""financial situation just cannot get better"" intrigues me.

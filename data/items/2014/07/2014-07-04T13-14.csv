For instance, Python has the StopIteration exception to signal the end of an iteration.<p>Exceptions force API designers to decide whether or not a situation is exceptional enough to force a stack unwind on the caller&#x27;s end. That&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s necessarily decidable from the point of view of the library.<p>For instance, say you have a function http.get(url). Should a 404 response automatically raise an exception? What about a 301? A network issue? Surely, for a crawler, a 404 is not exceptional enough to merit a hidden goto that unwinds the stack frame (by default). The designer of the http library cannot decide which status code is exceptional in every application.<p>It&#x27;s similar with the results of SQL statements, file system access and all sorts of other IO related stuff.<p>It seems to me that the more complex a system is, the more it needs a very specific error handling strategy anyway and doesn&#x27;t benefit from library designers&#x27; opinions about what is and isn&#x27;t worth a stack unwind.<p>That said, I do hate seeing<p><pre><code>  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n</code></pre>\non every other line of code.",1404481744

7988680,comment,7987805,7988287,1,0,randallsquared,,,"I think this depends strongly on your development style.<p>If you come from the world of scripting languages, a common style is &quot;write between one and twenty lines of code; run tests; edit three lines; run tests...&quot;, where &quot;run tests&quot; might literally be that, or might just be running the code to sanity check that things are not too broken.  In this style, even a twenty second delay would become very painful.<p>I think people who learned on C, C++ or Java tend to write much larger pieces of code in between run attempts, simply because it takes (or took) a while to check your work, instead of being effectively instantaneous.

7988667,comment,7987805,7988557,9,0,lumpypua,,,"No seriously, also having used it for 10 years it&#x27;s an issue for python. Three quick personal examples, though I&#x27;ve dealt with a number more:<p>1. Python web frameworks<p><a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r9&hw=i7&test=query"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r9&hw=i7...</a><p>Carefully configured Flask can get up to 1/3rd the speed of other web frameworks. But misconfigure it, use an ORM, or if you&#x27;re on django, you&#x27;re serving 1/10th as many requests/sec with significantly higher latency than other languages.<p>2. Templating<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1324238/what-is-the-fastest-template-system-for-python"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1324238/what-is-the-fast...</a><p>Template rendering takes an appreciable amount of time. I had to replace django&#x27;s (slow as shit) stock templates with jinja2 on a project because it was taking tens of seconds to render a very large page. Jinja is far faster, but it&#x27;s still slow enough that I had to add a caching layer to a website that shouldn&#x27;t need one.<p>3. Numerical shit<p>I implemented a video processing algorithm from a paper for a computer vision class. Python&#x27;s scientific and numeric libraries were sick and made prototyping delightfully easy--then the final runs on the full dataset took <i>forever</i>. What I re-implemented in C++ was >10x faster. Vectorization and other tweaks can make python numerics go faster, but it&#x27;s a pain in the ass. One of the goals of the Julia scientific programming language is to make loops fast enough that code doesn&#x27;t have to be manually vectorized.",1404481038

As far as I know, aside from ART, all state of the art Java Runtimes are using JIT. In theory, JIT should have the advantage of having live profile data, the ability to speculatively do optimization and back off when they&#x27;re wrong, etc...<p>The article list a bunch of benefits, but they don&#x27;t really seem to stand up to scrutiny. Overhead from repeatedly having to JIT the code? Cache it - also removing the battery life argument. AoT having the advantage of seeing all the code and do global optimizations? It&#x27;s just the opposite!<p>I could see some advantage of AoT for first-startup, but that isn&#x27;t even claimed as an advantage, because the AoT happens at install, not at compilation/packaging time.<p>It&#x27;s even stranger as modern Android phones have 4 to even 8 cores. That leaves plenty of horsepower to do the JITing in the background and be even faster.<p>Now, I can see that ART is faster simply because it&#x27;s a better, second iteration on Dalvik (which wasn&#x27;t great). Dalvik was 2-3 times slower than standard JITs. ART seems to make up this difference, but that still leaves the question: why did Google choose to go the AoT route instead of JIT?",1404480753

It is unfortunate.<p>I feel like Google should have just taken it and used it as Go back then. I would have been a good choice.<p>There is also GNOME&#x27;s Vala language.

But again kind of fringe.<p>This &quot;fringe-ness&quot; in longer term translates in less libraries/frameworks. With Python if I am starting on something new, I know I can probably find someone that wrote a library related to it. Scientific computing, AI learning, graphics, GUI bindings, http parsing, WSGI middleware, strange protocol parsers, libraries on top of C libs (parse .pcap files) and so on.

QML was a much nicer experience and I can get the results I want very quickly with few or no errors. CSS is a struggle every single time.<p>Is that just me not being bothered to learn CSS? Or could it possibly be that CSS really isn&#x27;t that good a tool to begin with?",1404479473

This study shows that motivated people really can do like I did, which is something doctors like the doc in a hat two days ago don&#x27;t apparently believe. As to the criticisms based on statistical merits, I&#x27;ll defer to this passage from the report, &quot;The Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board determined that these were acceptable outcome measurements to evaluate the nutrition program.&quot; If it&#x27;s good enough for the Cleveland Clinic, it&#x27;s good enough for me.

I don&#x27;t like the phrase &quot;constructive criticism&quot; because it&#x27;s been used into meaningless, but that&#x27;s basically what&#x27;s being suggested. Let me try an example instead of a definition.<p>Let&#x27;s say someone is making a clear architectural misstep: They&#x27;re trying to use python/django on a project, but their goals really require something like Tornado, and they&#x27;re building themselves into a corner.<p>Maybe from where you&#x27;re sitting it looks like an idiot mistake. The question is then, how to engage? Do you tell them condescendingly that only an idiot would misuse tools like that, and that they&#x27;re foolishly the HTTP request/response model that Django implements?<p>Or, do you try to guess at where their knowledge fails, and give them links to writeups about asynchronous programming? Or do you engage them in conversation and try to ascertain why they&#x27;re making the mistake, and gently explain that better programming models have been devised for the problem they&#x27;re trying to solve, and why don&#x27;t they look into it and see if they agree, and &quot;by the way if you have any more questions here&#x27;s my email, I&#x27;d be happy to help.&quot;<p>If people can&#x27;t handle receiving this last approach, then it speaks to a certain lack of immaturity. If people can&#x27;t handle acting taking this, it also speaks to a certain lack of maturity. We should try to build and enforce social norms that help growth as programmers and minimize conflict. Fortunately these goals aren&#x27;t inimical; in fact, the more contentious the discussion, the less learning gets done.",1404478988

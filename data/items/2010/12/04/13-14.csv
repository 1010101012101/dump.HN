Google paying scraper sites like Mahalo and Ask to borrow your content & wrap it in ads means that you are sometimes getting outranked for scraped duplications of your own content. That drives down publisher margins and pushes marginally profitable publishers into losing money.<p>That said, Google wants to get big into television ads.

This is partly because of GPUs, and partly because of technological considerations.<p>However, the article seems to suggest that there is a dichotomy between modern CPUs and throughput-oriented architectures. This is not true. For instance, the Sun Niagra eschews out-of-order execution and branch speculation to gain throughput by executing 8 threads concurrently. This type of microarchitecture is still more flexible than your contemporary GPU, but gives you considerably higher throughput for I/O dominated applications.<p>In fact, I'll go so far as to say that although future architectures will be hybrids of low-latency and high-throughput designs, the high-throughput parts will resemble CPUs more than current GPUs.",1291469350

He seemed effervescent with novelty, full of grand and strange ideas about the future of education. At the time, he was working on a 'robot teacher' platform based around a radio-controlled model, a webcam and an IP control interface. He seemed quite confident that the next big thing in his work would be some sort of robotic telepresence, capable of moving around the classroom and performing simple tasks to completely supplant the need for a local teacher. The 'granny cloud' is the product of a long succession of <i>very</i> odd experiments.<p>It got me thinking about the so-called 'Nobel syndrome' - the tendency for newly appointed Nobel laureates to make controversial statements about fields unrelated to their own. Perhaps a certain detachment from reality is necessary to make real progress. Perhaps academia needs to be an ivory tower, perhaps it's for the best that scientists often have little sense of the practical applications of their work. Thinking about my own work, I'm considering instituting my own Googleesque 20% time and allocating a specific part of my working hours to a project that I believe has no commercial relevance whatsoever.",1291469308

1969164,comment,1967117,1967117,0,0,gregpilling,,,"You probably won't find any statistics, but I can give you some personal anecdotes. I met my wife two weeks after she got a tenure track job at a tier 1 university. She spent 5 years working very hard - weekend, nights, no vacations - and got tenure (after writing a book and publishing a dozen papers). Part way through that process I started a company that grew within 4 years to 20 employees. From my perspective it seems like it takes similar effort and dedication. Or a my wife puts it ""nobody gets a PhD and tenure because they think it would be nice to have. It is just too much work if you are not committed"".<p>So if you are considering one or the other, think of them as the same amount of work. I would choose the startup. As _delirium says it is much easier to fail and start over with a startup than it is with tenured professor jobs. Some people don't get tenure, I personally know two people that didn't make it. Also consider that when you are a professor there are very very few jobs to choose from. There is only one university within a 100 miles of my house that my wife could work at, so how can she change jobs without us having to move? The number of academic couples that live in different cities for work is staggering. My wife was offered a job last year that was 2000 miles away which would make it a tough commute. For a final thought, I have tried to convince my wife to move to private industry for the past 5 years. She won't even consider it, but if she did move she would get paid much more and have many more job choices.",1291468902

So +F just puts less straight into tail mode.<p>Conversely, you can enable regular command-line options once a less session is already running, by just typing them.

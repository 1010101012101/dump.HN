If you have a conversation with somebody in the physical world and you are secure that that conversation is not being spied on, you can be sure that at no point in the future will that conversation be spied on. Encrypted digital communication simply translates that right to the digital world.<p>If an authority has pretty good knowledge that someone is in possession of encrypted digital files that only they have the password to access, this is simply the digital version of an authority having pretty good knowledge that someone has a buried treasure that only they have access to. This person cannot be coerced against their will to travel to the location of the buried treasure an dig it up just because an authority is pretty sure it is out there somewhere.<p>Others in this thread have pointed out that this is just law enforcement being lazy. And that is a very good point there are plenty ways to do law enforcement even if your target is communicating in codes and crucially it causes resources to focus on the important targets.<p>This is really crux of the matter, encrypted communication is not going to prevent law enforcement from doing their jobs. Crucially, what it does prevent, is the nation/world wide digital-technology enabled surveillance dragnets.<p>This is what must be kept in mind when considering this issue, we must make sure that we are creating future societies that are under no threat of nationwide spying from tyrannical governments.<p>In fact, any non-sense about &#x27;going dark,&#x27; or terrorism and criminals is a smokescreen and should be struck from any reasonable, level-headed discussion of this matter. Terrorism and crime are rare enough and law enforcement is good enough that we are under no risk in seeing an upswing in crime and terrorism due to continued proliferation of strong(that is, actual) encryption. The continued development and use of cryptography is entirely about preventing the kind of massive scale, unlawful spying that has been shown to be taking place.",1436759138

Treat people with dignity but don&#x27;t worry too much about how they will take it. They&#x27;re going to take it poorly. They&#x27;re going to be upset.

With this in mind, don&#x27;t let your process or productivity become unnecessarily disrupted and be <i>very</i> careful in making concessions.<p>With this many people, do it all at once. Don&#x27;t make people wait in agony for hours or days waiting to see if they&#x27;ll get called in next. The specifics on how to do that will depend on the structure and size of your company, but do not allow for suspense.<p>Like others said, treat the employees with dignity and offer a reasonable severance as far as is possible. This isn&#x27;t about preserving your relationship with them, it&#x27;s about being a decent human being and making accommodation to ease a large transition like that.<p>Good luck. Like I said above, don&#x27;t overthink it or worry about preserving your employees&#x27; opinions -- just behave in a manner that seems both reasonable and decent to you and be satisfied with that.

 a) third party liability;
 b) Customer&#x27;s liability towards LeaseWeb; and

 one million US Dollars (US$ 1,000,000.--).<p>Needless to say I was shocked. These terms are completely crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t even dare to guess how much that kind of insurance would cost me.

You might think the data in that graph is somehow false, but at least it&#x27;s very relevant data for this conversation.<p>Second, there indeed all kinds of sources claiming there&#x27;s been a primary surplus for years. It&#x27;s also clear that Greece is paying very little interest (2.6-4.0% of GDP in 2014 depending on the source -- it&#x27;s quite amazing that you can&#x27;t get reliable facts on something like this!). Their debt is also continuing to increase rapidly, and now they&#x27;re going to need another 80 billion bailout.<p>This combination of supposed facts just doesn&#x27;t add up. If there&#x27;s a primary surplus and the interest payments are tiny, there should be either a fiscal surplus or at most a tiny fiscal deficit. And in that case there&#x27;s no reason for the debt to grow. The easiest conclusion to see is that this is just the books being cooked once again. For example in 2013 that was a total of 9.5% of GDP in spending being ignored due to being supposedly non-recurring. (Not blaming Greece for this btw, it&#x27;s been in the interest of the EU to pretend that the situation is somehow getting better and the plan is working).<p>This rather suggests that forgiving the debt (not just, some but even all the debt) would do little to get them out of the whole.

Personally I wish I had gotten more, but it greater than zero so I couldn&#x27;t complain all that much(sorta, I wouldn&#x27;t have been happy if it was just a few hundred or so).<p>-Getting a month&#x27;s worth of health coverage.

I wanted to leave, and I&#x27;d never reapply anyway, but it was nice to do so on good terms.<p>-Getting an offer for a reference during the transition.

There is no easy way to do it even if it&#x27;s justified. The worst part is honestly what happens after - the person may have a hard time finding another job, and even if the separation is justified it&#x27;s still kind of &#x27;on you&#x27; for letting them go; a lot of people would assert that it&#x27;s on you anyway for not making them better.<p>I&#x27;ve been through a &#x27;silent layoff&#x27; at a startup, wherein most of the staff just stopped getting paid. We were funded by PE; the leadup to the separation was several weeks of accusations back and forth re: lying about available funds vs. mismanagement of granted funds. The company offered no severance and fought my unemployment claim. I was kind of relieved when it was over, but I would not recommend handling it this way unless you just don&#x27;t care; it&#x27;s been years but I still basically hate everyone involved.<p>I&#x27;ve since survived 3-4 rounds of layoffs where I&#x27;m working now. We&#x27;ve had it most of the ways you can have it: mass meeting, one on one w/ HR rep, nominated out-of-dept managers shepherding individuals out of the building, rent-a-cops in the office, etc. In all but one case, the departing employees were given a couple of paychecks severance + placement assistance and IIRC in at least one case remaining employees were offered grief counseling.<p>I don&#x27;t think I could ever enjoy being laid off, but IMO the right way in a multi-person separation is to have one meeting with everyone, be honest about what&#x27;s going on, and give them whatever you can to soften the blow. Unless there&#x27;s a good chance your funding situation is about to improve, this means you should do it a little earlier than you think you need to so that last x days/weeks of salary can be severance instead; IMO people are not going to be significantly happier about being laid off if it happens 2 weeks later. If you&#x27;ve got contacts at other places and you can give references or help place, do that. You probably don&#x27;t need police to escort people out, but you should get the departing employees out of the building w/ relevant credentials and badges revoked asap. Don&#x27;t let people mill around, it exposes you and gives them more opportunity to vent in ways both of you will regret; I&#x27;ve seen where people were let go, then went and deleted things from file servers or otherwise destroyed property prior to leaving the building.",1436757445

In America, H1Bs have very oppressive terms for being out of work, in that one is technically immediately out of status if laid off. This means that they would have to quickly find a new job willing to transfer their visa (within a couple of weeks) or take their family and leave the country.

The corresponding <i>average</i> GW would depend on the location of the installation... in Perth, Australia, which has exceptionally good insolation, you might get 1.4-1.5 GW on average over a year. And then, you&#x27;d have no power on demand, you would have to take it when it is available, or waste it.<p>OTOH... the ~8 GW you mentioned is thermal power, if it is electricity you want, you will need to spend another $12-15 billion on power generation plants (and infrastructure such as LNG tankers, import terminals etc.). And then, with an exceptionally efficient combined cycle plant, you only get abt 8*55% = 4.4 GW of electric power (but it is &quot;on demand&quot;).<p>Furthermore, the cost of producing the gas is not just the cost of the vessel - you need to drill wells and connect them to the vessel via pipelines/manifolds/risers. You need to pay for the operations, maintenance and repairs. And to begin with, you need to explore for gas, spending hundreds of millions of dollars with no guarantee of success.<p>By the time you consider the full picture, solar power is competitive with gas for electric power generation, more so in some places (like Australia, where Tony Abbott is going full retard on renewable energy) than others (like Germany, which leads the world in installed PV capacity).",1436757344

The reason is that the first time you get laid off, you think to yourself you are absolutely fucked and there is no way out of the tunnel, especially with bills looming. But in hindsight, it was never as bad as it seemed. I was able to hook up with a recruiter and I was back in another job within 20-30 days. So here I am telling you I survived and everything turned out ok!<p>Having said that, if I were about to get laid off there are some things that would ease the transition and make it more bearable. First worry is income. If you could guarantee a months severance, that would go a long way. Second is health insurance. If you could have all those resources prefigured out by the time I left, I&#x27;d be much happier. Third is promise of future income. If you could have recruiters on standby so that if I could make the choice to begin the job search, it would be great. Lastly, this is sorta extra credit, but experiencing job loss is quite tramatic. You can make counselors / work therapists available to be there in the time of need.<p>Basically what I&#x27;m trying to say, if you are going to let people go, make the only thing they have to worry about is getting over the shock of getting let go.

I have a personal dislike for allowing your &quot;master&quot; key to be used for encryption, because it incentivizes you to do things that are not best-practice: specifically, using it.  In the ideal world, your master key is kept, encrypted, on one (or more) USB drives that are all kept in various safes, and are never plugged into a computer that has an internet connection.  Bonus points if the computer isn&#x27;t used for anything else either.  This is because your master key is the Thing That Must Not Be Compromised -- or you need to revoke the entire key and can never use it again.  If a &quot;working&quot; subkey gets compromised, you can revoke it without losing all of the certification effort you&#x27;ve put into validating your identity in the web of trust.",1436756981

It never gets easier; you just get better at it.<p>I agree with @steven2012&#x27;s feedback.  To add a few things:<p>1) I&#x27;d recommend you work with your attorneys to draft up a termination agreement that includes a severance package.  I&#x27;d also recommend you cut a check and include it with the letter.  When you sit them down to talk them through the agreement (individually), you can present check to them and ask them to sign it and take the check.  You don&#x27;t want to force them into signing anything, but you also do want to try to get it done cleanly and completely for the sake of the business moving forward.  If they hesitate or say they want to review the terms later, or with an attorney, don&#x27;t push it.  But do make the check large enough that it&#x27;ll be easy for them to sign on the spot if at all possible -- you want to treat them fairly and not have to deal with loose ends later if you can help it.<p>2) It&#x27;s extremely important to take the &quot;one and done&quot; deeper cut approach.  There&#x27;s nothing worse than everyone wondering when the other shoe is going to drop.  I&#x27;d recommend you take the remaining team out to lunch and make sure they know that they are safe -- and you all have to rally together to make the company a success.<p>As an aside -- the only regret I&#x27;ve ever had is waiting to fire people that I knew had to go.  Learning to be more aggressive about moving under-performers out faster has been one silver lining from the whole process, over time.<p>Good luck.  It&#x27;s a terrible foreboding feeling going into it, but you&#x27;ll fee a big sense of relief afterwards, and if the employees you&#x27;re letting go are unhappy in their jobs, they may end up thanking you later for helping them move on to find something they loved more.",1436756650

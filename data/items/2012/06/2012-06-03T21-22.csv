So I can't say I agree with this sentiment. The issue I have is how to get the word out basically -- how to convince others I am not merely blowing smoke up their ass, how to present the info in an effective and useful fashion, how to get publicity and so on. So, no, yo aren't likely to read any headline news about my ""discovery"" any time soon.  Makes me wonder how many other people have done something amazing on thei own but we aren't hearing about it.<p>Peace.",1338760624
4061860,comment,4061059,4061574,3,0,scott_s,,,"<i>I interpret ""muscle memory"" to mean ""have a good default toolset"" in this context.</i><p>I don't. In sports, we use ""muscle memory"" to refer to on-the-fly adaptations that athletes have to perform without conscious thought. For example, a basketball player sees his defender lean too far in one direction, and he automatically knows when to stop, jump and shoot in order to avoid being blocked. The shooter did not have to consciously think ""Oh, he leaned that way, so I need to correct this way."" That's too slow. The right thing to do is ingrained from hours of drilling and live practice. My sport of choice is Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and I see the same thing with myself all the time. When I feel my opponents weight shift, I don't consciously <i>think</i> about how to flip him over. If I do, he'll already have moved. I just <i>know</i> what to do, based on years of drilling and live training.<p>So, I extend the metaphor to software to rather the opposite of what you said. Always applying a default toolset is the opposite of on-the-fly adaptations. ""Muscle memory"" for solving software problems is being able to reason about what you know you can handle without having to pick a technology up front. It's having an intuition of what what the technology allows you to do. You're not thinking in terms of technology, you're thinking in terms of solving the problem and being able to easily classify things as ""I know how to handle"" and ""I don't know yet how to handle.""<p>The benefit of software over sports is that we have the luxury of time; we have the time to check our intuitive guesses through rational evaluation.",1338760588

When you read stories about people in the news they are always presented as very clearly being ""a"" or ""b"". ""He always knew he wanted to be President"" or ""He wanted to be a ball player but ended up being President"". Anyway the question can in some cases even be annoying and make you feel defensive. I dated a girl once who insisted on knowing what it was I liked about a particular dish. Why is it important why I like pizza? I just like pizza. Think a minute (if you are a straight guy) about why you like tits. Go ahead. Not sure about you but I can't answer that question. I just like the way they look. Is that an adequate answer? It triggers some thing in me that makes me feel good. I think it's easier many times to describe what you don't like, than what you like.

It doesn't make me think their devs are bad. It's more of the ""rock star"" and ""ninja"" wishlist stuff. No company-- not even Google, Apple, or Facebook-- is going to employ only developers who are all at the top of their field. If you're a startup, you must have a pathway to get your average programmers to greatness.<p>When I hear stuff like ""hand-holding"" it makes me think of companies that hire based on keyword matching. They don't want to put anything at all into their employees, they just want the best output right away. No wonder these firms are always complaining about not being able to hire talent. They could develop talent, but they don't-- it's either getting the creme of the crop engineers (which they're not going to be able to get anyway since they can't compete with the above-mentioned companies on salary and benefits) or nothing!<p>The really creative startups I'm seeing now are those that train.

To get approved for use in any indication a drug has to go through a number of clinical trials - a Phase 2 in a small group of patients and multiple Phase 3's in a larger group.<p>And that's for one indication only. So a cancer drug might try to get approved for ""4th line"" use in some cancer, meaning the FDA says it's okay to use after 3 other drugs have failed. After some success there, the drug company might push to expand its label into 3rd line or front line treatment and sponsor more clinical trials to compare it to the drugs currently used at those times.<p>I don't know what trial this article was talking about specifically, but there were a number of other trials abiraterone did spectacularly in beforehand. Unfortunately, I don't recall the specific data from years ago when I kept up with this stuff.<p>Cancer drugs frequently ""work"", but just barely, stopping the progression of symptoms for a few months or so, and this is enough to get approved. On the other hand, you have Gleevec[1], which turned a certain variety of leukemia from invariably fatal to a death rate of just 1%. Its efficacy was noted early in the trials and got approved quickly.<p>Similarly, abiraterone's efficacy showed clearly in the early trials, although it's somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between ""barely efficacious"" and Gleevec.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imatinib</a>",1338759958

You're new, and so I suggest that you listen carefully, ask questions about things that you don't understand (otherwise you'll feel like a dumbass next time they bring it up, and you still don't know what they're talking about).<p>When you've been working somewhere for a while you also tend to dismiss the problems around you. Make sure you note down all of the things that you find wrong about the place - ask people why these things are they way that they are - it could be a misunderstanding on your part, but it could also be that there are genuinely things that need fixing.<p>Make sure you keep a notepad on you - note down everything that you learn, problems that you see etc - it'll come in handy.<p>After a couple of weeks you can start acting on fixing the problems that you've seen - if you actively seek to solve problems, then you can become a hero in the company - the guy that made our lives better.<p>Lastly remember that if you want something you'll have to fight for it. Don't be afraid to disagree with people, but you have to play a fine game when you've just come into the company - you don't want to piss people off, but you also don't want to set the expectation that you're OK with shitty code.<p>I hope that helps! have fun out there ;)<p>Lou

Even more so, everybody has a greater stake in the system of decision-making than they do in the decision itself.<p>Look at it this way: suppose ten people are in a lifeboat stranded on the ocean. There are no supplies, and everybody is starving to death. Logically, killing and eating one of the people would allow the rest to survive. However the group votes not to do that, and they all starve. Later it's discovered that had they lived a few more days they would have been rescued.<p>Or you could play it the other way: they all unanimously decide to draw straws - the ""law of the sea"" -- and yet it does no good.<p>In either case, having consent of those involved is more important than optimizing around one individual's opinion, <i>even if that opinion represents an outcome that's in the best interest of the most people involved.</i><p>You don't have to believe me. Play various scenarios out a few times yourself and work through it. And it's not unanimous agreement, not at all. The trick, as the other commenter pointed out, is to create a simple and understandable system where the minority still participates when they lose arguments. (Obviously eating the minority in our example would prevent such participation, which is why only unanimous consent would work, and it would only work in coming up with some selection criteria, not actually applying it.) I think you'll find that people deserve the dignity of being wrong, even when faced with their own death.<p>I'm also not saying that ""we should not even try."" Far from it. True learning takes place in a group setting from the bottom-up, in a peer-to-peer fashion. Once critical mass is reached, persuasion is used to convince the majority. That's the way systems of people operate, which is much, much different from the way we might like them to work, or the way a mathematical proof might work.",1338758683

It seems that nothing great can emerge unless you do what you love to do. And when you do what you love to do, nothing is great: you just do what you love and keep wondering why all these people think it's great and think you're successful.<p>What's success anyway? It's not money; probably all successful people didn't do it for the money and consequently they also kept doing it after they got money. Is success about not having to worry about mundane things? In that case anyone can be successful, just stop worrying. Is success about doing what you love? In many cases doing what you love invites success but that alone doesn't necessarily equal success.<p>I think success is close to arriving at a point in life where you stop ""needing"" things merely to complement who you are.<p>By this rule when you become the advertisers' nightmare you've succeeded because you don't ""need"" anything you don't need. Anything you think you ""need"" will give a warm feeling of security that always vanishes too soon, and there's always more.

The journalist is in fact saying that the ""digital divide"" doesn't exist because that conceptualization of the issue is too simple and doesn't leave room for the nuances of how people who aren't seen by the dominant cultural narrative as being technologically sophisticated are, sometimes, very wired in their own ways.<p>The critique is trying to draw attention to the ways we provide enormous amounts of money for programs that try to get people to use technology in the ""right"" way, which is, as the interviewee states, basically measuring everyone by how much they use technology the way affluent white men do. Other people are finding ways to appropriate technology for their own needs and uses that are just as valid and valuable for their own situations but these aren't recognized in the way this money is meted out and the ways the success of these programs are measured. For instance, you could argue that teen engagement with online social networks now serves a crucial function in identity formation, which is valuable and possibly, more useful to some of the kids than some of the things you learn in class. If, for instance, you're a 16 year old kid coming out, I'd venture that having social support in that process will probably be more valuable 20 years down the line than memorizing the difference between sine, cosine and tangent.. but when it comes to what NTIA will use as a measure of success for their programs, it'll be the trig scores.<p>Edit: a good starting point for research into the (imo, really important) functions online social networks serve for teens is danah boyd's dissertation (as well as some of her other work).

It could be a good way to say what you did this week, where you're aiming to be next week, problems etc that have happened along the way.<p>Could be a good way to motivate people to do what they say, and get help from others. It'd be good to note down what people want to achieve each week, submit it all somewhere centrally, and then go around each person who gets 2 minutes to say what they did, problems they had, where they will be next week...<p>Lou

The code is very well written and understandable making it easy to dive in and make fixes and/or changes to suit your needs.  Using Mezzanine's page_processors it is also very easy to add custom logic to any page you have created without having to modify the core codebase.  The community around it is also great and very responsive, helpful and open to make changes to suit the needs of users.<p>Mezzanine provides all the basic features you would need in a CMS and then makes it very easy to add anything custom or unusual you might want.  In this way you don't get overwhelmed by stuff you don't need.",1338757432

4061736,story,,,1,3,djsamson,"Ask HN: How can I differentiate this product/get it created?",,"I realize ideas are worth nothing without execution so I'd like to share my thoughts with the HN community in hopes of learning some insight. I'm at college and work a minimum wage job and the small business owner I work for literally writes all of our hours in a small notepad. He often forgets to text us when we're working and when we want time off we have to leave post it notes on his desk which he inevitably loses. I'm guessing other small businesses might not be this bad but if they're using the same paper method they probably have some of the same problems.<p>My MVP idea is simple: build a web site that sells monthly subscriptions for employee scheduling software. The employer would have his own log in and would be able to input employees and when they're working on an online spread sheet. Employees could view this spread sheet online to see when they're working. They could also log in to trade shifts with someone or ask for time off in advance.<p>I have two problems. First, there are a decent amount of software companies doing this: http://employee-scheduling-software-review.toptenreviews.com/<p>What intrigues me however is that virtually none of the businesses I've worked for or the ones my friends work for use any of these software. Some of these companies offer extensive features which is intimidating to me. But I feel like there is hope because a) this market is far from mature (not many small businesses have embraced this technology yet from my experience and b) I could offer less features initially and also charge a smaller fee than the competition.<p>My second issue is I'm not technical. If my customer dev interviews go well, I'm going to pay out of pocket to get this made. Is it realistic to think I could pay the same developer to do front end/back end development? Would this be an expensive project?<p>Thank you for your input",1338757297

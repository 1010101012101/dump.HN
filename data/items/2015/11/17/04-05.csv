And not to sound like a cranky old man, but that shit sucks.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous that their &quot;app&quot; needs 20-30 seconds to boot on a modern computer. It&#x27;s a damned music player. Plus, when the machine is under load, it skips like a 1993 disc player. And the damned thing crashes routinely.<p>Pre-CEF I was terribly impressed by their mac client. It&#x27;s been a pretty ugly cliff they&#x27;ve fallen off though. They did a developer blog post some time ago detailing how teams are all using separate JS routines and libs... and I have to say, I wasn&#x27;t surprised. It&#x27;s rare that a popular app regresses in performance and usability quite as much as they have.",1447736383

Dang working his magic again.<p>What I find most frustrating about this story is that the panelist recognises that whole process is not able to determine which grants should be funded (basically they are all good), yet he still continues to try and do so. If you can’t tell which of the good grants is better than the other just put all the good grants into a lottery and fund as many as you can - every other option is worse.<p>Edit. I should add that my experience of being on committees like this is that excluding yourself when you have a conflict is a highly effective way of getting your grant funded. The people left in the room can hardly decide to not fund you to your face when you come back into the room.

It could be an expression of frustration; an act by one who doesn&#x27;t care, or cares exclusively and consumingly. And it is horrific, disgusting, and morally reprehensible.<p>The word is not merely propaganda, it is a word whose extremity exactly conveys the revulsion and moral judgement of the speaker. As with any label, you run the risk of superficiality and preoccupation with simplified narratives, but &quot;terrorism&quot; is NOT just propaganda, and it deliberately conveys more than &quot;acts of violence&quot;. (A clinical term with its own problems of distancing audiences from the immediate reality.)<p>I wrote this because your last sentence seemed to imply something that I&#x27;ve noticed crop up in these kinds of discussions: the (typically Western) assumption that there is legitimacy to both sides of any conflict, and that, recognizing this, a diplomatic solution can be achieved. I&#x27;ve yet to see concrete evidence that this is the case. Short of deprogramming, how do you reason with a group of people brainwashed to be fundamentally unreasonable?",1447735872

The vast majority of those reasons are still valid, even though PyPy speeds up some general-purpose programming tasks in Python.<p>&quot;A loop that just counts&quot; is not anywhere near a substitute for Numpy.  Nor does a 25x speed increase in a particular operation (from CPython to PyPy) hold a candle to the number-crunching speedups provided by algorithm-optimized, code-optimized (often to the point of targeting specific vector instruction sets like SSEx) special-purpose numeric libraries.",1447733453

This makes me wonder if anyone ever did think that Livingston was &quot;some kind of secretary&quot; [and what&#x27;s wrong with that] or if that assumption just plays to the conclusion that sex rather than, say, hot-headed assertiveness or attention seeking is the reason for the disparity in public perceptions of Livingstone and Graham. [I&#x27;m talking speculatively, I don&#x27;t know either of these people].<p>Given the nature of the essay I find this, in the footnotes, quite peculiar:<p>>No one understands female founders better than Jessica. //<p>Why does she only understand female founders the best - that would presumably be because females are inherently different in some characteristics pertinent to being founders? Why is this not &quot;No one understands founders better ...&quot; is there someone who does understand founders better but for some reason is unable to understand female founders as well as they do male founders.<p>Surely this is the answer to the question posed on notability if others are better at understanding founders who are male, for some reason, then as more founders are male [it seems, I don&#x27;t have stats on this, just going with my perception of the consensus] it would stand to reason that those best able to understand the largest cadre of founders are most notable - this understanding we&#x27;re told is the vital element in the field after all.<p>The inclusion of the word &quot;female&quot; here is the key one way or another.<p>>The person who knows the most about the most important factor in the growth of mature economies—that is who Jessica Livingston is. //<p>It almost looks like Graham is saying, but perhaps not wanting to say, that the sex of his co-founder is the key element in reaching a broader base of founders?<p>I&#x27;m not at all saying Livingston isn&#x27;t the best person in the World in this role, but Graham&#x27;s footnote leads away from that conclusion.<p>On a slightly different focus:<p>>There are successful women who don&#x27;t like to fight. //<p><i>People</i>. There are successful _people_ who don&#x27;t like to fight; unless you&#x27;re saying their sex is the reason they don&#x27;t like to fight or that this characteristic is peculiar to women then why do people have to force sexual bivalence all the time.

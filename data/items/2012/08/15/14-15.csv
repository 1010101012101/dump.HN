Comments like this just reinforce the stereotype (myth?) of 20 year olds chasing multimillion dollar lean startup VC IPO dreams.  Many people over 25 start up organizations/companies.<p>You can look at it as ""oh it's so hard, i've got a mortgage!"".  Or you can look at it as ""Wow, I've got some really good experience in industry X, skills to sell, and established roots in industry X and my local/regional area to help me get moving faster!"".<p>There's a few entrepreneurs/startups in our area that I really respect, and most of them started over 30.  One was closer to 40 before he started, and wasn't really rocking it until 40 or just a bit after I think.<p>Living at home with your parents, no rent/food to pay would still be hard if you didn't have enough money for a computer and net connection (assuming you're trying to work online).

4386233,comment,4385212,4385329,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"It's not so simple, and for the vast majority of use who don't have strong real-time requirements there are a couple other things to say:<p>The two big managed languages (Java and C#) are now getting fast enough that there is only one place where slower performance can be assumed.  That's the startup time - bootstrapping the managed runtime and JITing the code takes a while, so languages like C will always rule for execution patterns along the lines of a CGI script.<p>It can also be said that they'll always be bigger memory hogs, which is something to think about when you're working in a constrained environment. That's a side effect of the garbage collector - objects aren't cleaned up right away, so there's always a ""queue"" of objects that are waiting for cleanup that's just sitting around occupying RAM.<p>However, in terms of overall performance the story gets murky. In many real-world applications C or C++ is unlikely to outperform the managed languages (certainly not by a significant margin) unless significant spent on careful optimization.  All that work increases both initial development and continuing maintenance costs, though, so it is unlikely to be worthwhile unless you're in a situation where a small amount of execution time really is worth a large amount of money.<p>This is a difference you're never going to be seeing on the benchmark sites, though. Benchmarks are by necessity small programs, which means that are easy to carefully optimize to an extent that doesn't necessarily reflect what is practical in the real world.",1345042623

High fixed monthly fees have been imposed by the underlying banks that provide merchant accounts for years. Some banks have recently relaxed those and Braintree, Stripe and others in the industry are now able to take advantage of it.<p>The reason we were able to waive the fixed fee when you contacted us was not because it was in our discretion the entire time, but because we had only recently been able to get some of those fixed fees removed by the underlying banks. Since that time, we have been proactively contacting hundreds of our customers that would benefit from the new bank structure to offer them lower pricing.<p>The 6% reserve on your transactions wasn't imposed by Braintree but rather the bank that was providing your merchant account (Braintree is not holding back anyone's money). We work extremely hard to prevent reserves being imposed on our merchants and when it does happen, our intent is to get it removed as soon as possible. Please reach out to us so that we can work on getting your funds released asap.<p>We could have handled your situation better, and we're sorry that we weren't able to get lower fees to you faster. We've been browbeating banks for years on behalf of startups to get simpler, better fee structures. We've made a lot of progress and think we've had an impact on the industry with things like simpler pricing and card data portability. That said, we recognize there is a lot more work to do, and we will continue to work hard to provide an exceptional payments experience for startups.",1345042482

Add in for yourself and other hangers-on additional equity based on time worked from this point forward, with industry-standard vesting.<p>You can also fold in an acquisition:  Start new company, all the old company's assets are valued at X and you proportionally issue Y nonvoting shares in the new company to all the old shareholders (where Y is a small percentage of the total).  Cofounder must either sign off or be outvoted at old company, or else you're stuck.<p>Crackpots always think that their work begins and ends before a product gets traction (even many prodigious successful businesspeople lean this way until they learn by succeeding) when the truth of the matter is that the work is much more back-loaded than it seems.<p>If you hired a general contractor to build a house, and he left it 50% done, lots of times you'd have to pay more to get it completed than if you'd never hired him at all.

A few thoughts:<p>1. 1080p streaming video from Apple, Netflix and others looks pretty good, but it suffers from more compression artifacts when compared to Blu-ray. It simply doesn't look as good. With a more efficient compression technology, streaming video could have similar file sizes to today's H.264 video but look more like Blu-ray.<p>2. I already own a laptop that does above 1080p video. When Apple release a Retina iMac or Thunderbolt display it will be around 5k. Other manufactures will be there too. 4k or so TVs and projectors are on their way. Streaming technology makes a lot more sense than a new physical format for higher resolution video. In order to realistically deliver 4k video (or 5k video like The Hobbit is being shot in) over IP, we would need better compression than H.264<p>3. Files sizes could be cut down, allowing people to consume more video without going over their caps. This would also allow mobile devices to store more high quality video content for on the go.<p>The best case scenario would be that we get a combo of all three. 4k-5k video content is still a bit way for home use, but when it does come. H.265 sounds like the way to go.<p>In the next few years, this technology could be used to cut down on file sizes some, while also upping the quality of video. This is what we saw with Apple's 1080p video which uses high profile H.264 video, whereas Apple's 720p video is main profile H.264. Yes, the 1080p videos are bigger, but not by much.",1345041349

Im just arguing that while moving to persistent, immutable values is a big step in what could be a good direction, its not sufficient by itself to justify or cause a shift in mainstream programming styles on the scale of abandoning OOP (as suggested in the original post I replied to).<p>You lose things in that transition, very useful things that are widely applicable. Were not going to just give those up without having something good enough to replace them, and I thought that in this specific talk those two areas I mentioned were glossed over far too readily.<p>For example, although Rich said very clearly that he thought it was OK to manipulate data in-place as an implementation detail of how a new value is built, he then argued that once the finished result was ready it should become an immutable value, and that we no longer need to use abstractions that are based on or tied to that kind of underlying behaviour. I contend that there are many cases where it is not so simple even with todays technology, and that the idea of constraining in-place mutation to the initial creation of a value is a leaky abstraction that will not survive a lot of practical applications.<p>Later on, processes are briefly mentioned, but that part of the talk is about information systems, which are mostly concerned with pure data analysis. That makes it is rather easy to dismiss the idea of modelling interactive processes in context, but unfortunately, very many real world programs do need to be concerned with the wider time-related concepts like effects.<p>Im sure Rich himself is well aware of all of these issues. Hes discussed related ideas in far more detail on other occasions, including in the talk that lrenn cited above. But I find his challenge near the end of <i>this</i> talk, If you can afford to do this, why would you do anything else? Whats a really good reason for doing something else? to be rather unconvincing. For one thing, thats a mighty big if, whether you interpret afford in terms of performance or dollars. For another thing, the answer to those questions could simply be Because this isnt capable of modelling my real world, interactive system effectively.",1345040339

If we can get people excited about programming, and build (or point them to) the resources they need to learn more then we will have been successful.<p>Eventually I think well work to effectively replicate the materials one typically finds in a Computer Science 101 but in a way that is far more engaging and self-paced than what you would find at a traditional university.""</i>",1345040308

If you don't know why everybody there is there, then either they're redundant, superfluous, or lost.<p>One thing I like to stress in my meetings that I run is that everybody knows <i>why</i> they are there.

Sometimes, you just need them to shut up, listen, and take notes.<p>I've found that if, when you set the meeting, you send a note to them after the invite with, ""Hey, I know you're busy, but I'd like you to listen in on this so you understand what's being discussed.

Upon gaining access to the person's email the system would copy all the email addresses from the archive and begin spamming those users with invitations to the social network. As many naive people do use the same password for many services this attack would often succeed.<p>Quora ( among others ) seem to be taking advantage of our current naive attitudes about social networking, privacy and sharing.

602043,comment,601439,601949,0,0,dhimes,,,"I think I get it.  We're trying to help the other countries build stronger economies.  When people are desperate, feeling powerless and without hope, they tend to seek violent means to attain that power and hope.  But by empowering other countries to lift themselves out of poverty or giving them the tools to become ""first world"" players, we actually make ourselves (US) more secure.<p>Said another way, it's a form of foreign aid.  Looked at from this point of view, you wouldn't let anyone stay unless there was really a special need.",1241956636
602041,comment,601891,602033,0,0,tumult,,,"<i>How often do you need object A->object B associations like that? Far easier to just put a pointer in all the object As to point to object Bs</i><p>This gives us an equivalent mapping, but unfortunately it alters the original object by adding a property to it. This sucks for two reasons; one is that the names might clash with a property that something else has set on that object, so you end up creating terrible names to avoid collisisions like someObject._prviate_associatedOtherObject or something, and then you have to make sure to destroy it when appropriate. It gets more hairy if you need multiple relations between the same objects. The other problem is that when you enumerate an object, now that property will show up. Gross. Yes, I know about the boilerplate you use to make enumerations in JS safe; my argument is that JS sucks as a language, and the necessity of stuff like this contributes to it.<p><i>For example, in an object constructor, just replace the toString() to return a unique ID for that object. A line of code :/</i><p>The Cappuccino/Objective-J guys at 280North have to do something similar (grep for OBJECT_COUNT++ in the source to see what I mean) in order to add identity to Obj-J objects.. but what if you didn't instantiate the object yourself? And I think this is the case where you'd be <i>most</i> likely to want to perform a mapping on an opaque object.",1241956322
602040,comment,601211,601858,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Yes, it would. People aren't persisting in using Emacs because it's a good editor, but rather because it's an integrated environment for manipulating anything textual (which happens to be scripted in a Lisp dialect). The integration is the important part, and it's integrated in a very different sense than, say, Visual Studio or Eclipse. It just happens to have ergonomically nightmarish default keybindings (and other historical baggage), and a culture that perpetuates them.<p>I've tried viper mode (I used vim for five years before I started using Emacs, and I still use nvi for quick editing sometimes), but it's against the current of the ten million other settings Emacs has.<p>I would love to see a real alternative to that facet of Emacs (and would work on one, if I ever got that kind of time...), but vim isn't it. Wily / Acme are closer, perhaps, but they trade complex keybindings for switching constantly between the mouse and keyboard, which is likely worse.",1241956140

Certainly, Microsoft has made many mistakes and are not at the top of their game right now.  But to suggest that ""Internet Explorer’s marketshare will probably dip below 50% within three years."" is a sign of their decline is comical.  Below 50%.. within three years.. the horror.<p>Microsoft continues to be a dominant force in the business world and will for the foreseeable future.  Thankfully, they now have competition again on many fronts that will only serve to push them to refocus and improve the products that have declined in recent years.",1241955923
602038,comment,601572,601572,0,0,klahnako,,,"IMHO, it is hard to find a domain that is challenging, useful, and small.   But a couple of examples listed above are pretty good:
1) Write your own web server, blog software, etc:  By leveraging existing libraries (or not!) you can get a lot of effect for very few lines
2) Script your daily chores:  It does not matter what language you write the “scripts” in.  Choose your current favorite and get a feel for how you can interact with the OS",1241955847

How often do you need object A->object B associations like that? Far easier to just put a pointer in all the object As to point to object Bs, and then put the object A's in an object/array.<p>Your use case is not something I've ever needed to be honest, and if you need it, it's simple to build it out yourself. For example, in an object constructor, just replace the toString() to return a unique ID for that object. A line of code :/<p>It's only dangerous when you don't understand what is happening.

It should hash based on an object's identity or something; as it stands, there's no way to do that in JS without bolting your own junk on top, as a result you can't do real object<->object associations in JS.<p>Python for example has well-defined and useful behavior when you shove something into a dict type as a key, for strings it will hash based on the string value, for some other things it will uses identity, etc., and you can overload it (which you can in JS too of course, as you showed.)",1241954189

So rather than the standard port for HTTP being port 80, instead certain web content could only be served on a particular port and of course this would make it easy to block said content by blocking its associated port.<p>Yes, you read that right. So like you'd have a porn port (lets say port 69) and a gambling port and eventually I guess you'd have a political decent port before too long.<p>This is the level of understanding we're dealing with.

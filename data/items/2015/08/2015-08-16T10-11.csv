Both claim that they are &quot;like&quot; awk, sed, cut, paste etc, but for $Format, where $Format is csv/tsv and json, respectively.<p>They both deal with much the same tasks, and there is <i>considerable</i> overlap.<p>What your PowerShell examples do not say, is how - after Import-Csv - you are no longer constrained to tools written for csv&#x27;s (or json or ...). At that point the records of the csv file have become <i>objects</i> in the PowerShell type system (which is an extension of the .NET type system).<p>Another point about the corresponding functionality in PowerShell is how you <i>do not</i> need to convert back to csv, json or whatever. Your <i>Export-Csv</i> commands in your examples are only needed if you want to finally save the results as csv. Otherwise you would just keep the objects in a variable or flowing through the pipeline/script.<p>So TFAs 2nd example could be written<p><pre><code>    ipcsv flins.csv | group county -n
</code></pre>
If the data had been in json, one would write<p><pre><code>    cat flins.json | convertfrom-json | group county -n
</code></pre>
Which also means that data can be export through any cmdlet that exports or converts a stream of objects: Export-Csv, ConvertTo-Csv, ConvertTo-Html, ConvertTo-Json, ConvertTo-Xml, ...",1439722357

It seems that it&#x27;s getting harder to find out of print publications/books/records, especially if they were somewhat obscure or rare from the beginning.<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but I would guess that it&#x27;s because those works are drowning in the vast and seemingly endless supply of others works. That, combined with it not being digitalized and that the physical representation might have rotted away or on the verge of rotting away.<p>What do you make out of this?",1439719889

I would recommend first reading through the README.md either on github or in your text editor.
Then start with the Basics.html by opening it in your browser and text editor. This way you can make changes and see the results. Hope this helps.",1439719679

I am not very clear on GPL. If I use it for my company, but I choose to release the source, do I still have to pay for a commercial license or is the open source license adequate? I know the commercial license comes with a lot of support material.",1439719320

6118443,comment,6117099,6118083,3,0,epidemian,,,"> I see it more as explicit. You HAVE to decide what you&#x27;re going to do in case of an error.<p>I&#x27;ve often read this argument, but i don&#x27;t see how that is an advantage over using exceptions.<p>With exceptions you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to decide what to do in every function call that might raise an error. You just have to know that they <i>can</i> raise one, and code accordingly. For example:<p><pre><code>  f = File.open(...)
  foo(f)
  bar(f)
  f.close()
</code></pre>
Is buggy if foo or bar could raise exceptions (the file would not be closed if an exception is raised there). Fixing it could imply adding a `finally` block around f.close() so the file always gets closed (same as Go&#x27;s defer) or using a higher order function that already does that for us:<p><pre><code>  File.open(...) do |f|
    foo(f)
    bar(f)
  end
</code></pre>
The thing is, this code didn&#x27;t need to worry about which of foo or bar was raising an error; it just needed to worry about closing the file if anything went wrong. And i could add a new baz(f) call in there, or maybe refactor the foo(f) and bar(f) calls into a foobar(f) function that does just that and the code will still be as linear. There&#x27;d be no need to add extra `if`s there nor in the refactored foobar(f) function.<p>> Usually it&#x27;s as simple returning that error...<p>I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s rather &quot;most of the time&quot; than &quot;usually&quot;. And exceptions give you exactly that default behaviour of propagating the error up the stack. Without having to obfuscate the logic of some intermediate code (that doesn&#x27;t care about what error could happen, as long as they are propagated to the caller) with superfluous `if`s and `return`s.",1375052119

6118439,comment,6117099,6117912,3,0,PommeDeTerre,,,"Rust appears very promising, but having followed it for some time now, it&#x27;s still severely lacking in terms of stability.<p>I&#x27;m talking about the stability of the language feature set and the amount of change it&#x27;s undergoing, rather than the quality of the implementation or anything of that sort.<p>While it&#x27;s good to see the language evolving and improving, this type of churn also means it isn&#x27;t very practical to use.<p>For example, some experimental Rust code I wrote a mere 6 to 8 months ago is now basically unusable with recent versions of Rust due to language functionality changes, syntax changes, and library changes.<p>I keep hoping that it&#x27;ll start to stabilize, even just on a feature set and standard library that may not be perfect, but will at least be usable for longer than a few months. Yet this doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening. This lack of stability will start to significantly hurt its adoption at some point.<p>Go has taken a better approach, in my opinion. It isn&#x27;t perfect, and it&#x27;s lacking some important functionality, but at least there&#x27;s a version that&#x27;s usable, well-supported, and usable well into the future, even if the language does continue to evolve in incompatible ways.",1375052061

So you have to decipher, poke and prod until you get a response. You have to also understand that emergency resources are limited. A cop at one address is one <i>less</i> available at another, more critical, location. Same with ambulances and firefighters. What may turn out to be a mundane call could have diverted precious rescue resources form where it&#x27;s really needed. So it&#x27;s not that simple.",1375049824

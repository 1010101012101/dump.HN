Thus, all absorbed photons would be re-emitted at with the same distribution as the blackbody walls. And apparently, this phenomenon was tested in an ultra-low temperature scenario.<p>Still, I wonder. Given the low temperatures, the Boltzmann distribution suggests photons in the microwave or lower frequencies.",1290632390

1938528,comment,1938032,1938051,0,0,_delirium,,,"The GPL/LGPL difference is that the LGPL makes a distinction between merely using a library, and modifying the library itself. Modifications to the library itself have to be released under the same (LGPL) license. Merely using the library has permissive terms, more BSD-style.<p>So, for example, you can write an application using the LGPL'd Qt or GTK widget toolkits, and license your application however you want. But if you start modifying the GTK source code to build your own new-and-improved GTK, you have to release your new-and-improved GTK under the LGPL (but still don't have to release the source to any applications you build on top of it).<p>The GPL doesn't make a distinction like that, and requires that any code that incorporates GPL'd code be also GPL'd.",1290632311

That Mac Donalds uses a batch processing method that is faster but requires a higher skill level, whereas BK uses an assembly line, and that this affects their advertising.  MacD's ads often double as recruiting ads, whereas BK tends to emphasize ""have it your way"" (easier to customize when you make burgers one at a time).<p>Maybe Google wants to interview more people than necessary, and subject them to an interview that leaves them thinking ""man, you need to be at the top of your game to work there!"" as a way of increasing the prestige of working there (and perhaps getting more top applicants?)<p>The thing is, I don't really see why this strategy would apply more to google than apple (unlike the MD vs BK thing...)<p>One thing is sure - devs are all aware of google's notorious interview process, but we (well, I should really just speak for myself, so I) never really hear these stories about apple.",1290632229

1938435,comment,1935815,1937030,0,0,jedbrown,,,"> go generic full speed<p>What does this mean?<p>As a simple example, suppose I use malloc to allocate memory (because I don't want to allocate with new which would oblige me to handle exceptions and prevent me from handing ownership over to a C client or using an allocator provided by a C client (without extra work)).  I have to cast the return value as in<p><pre><code>  struct Foo *x = (struct Foo*)malloc(n*sizeof(*x));
</code></pre>
instead of<p><pre><code>  struct Foo *x = malloc(n*sizeof(*x));
</code></pre>
This looks purely cosmetic, but in C, I can write the macro<p><pre><code>  #define MallocA(n,p) (!(*(p) = malloc((n)*sizeof(**(p))))
</code></pre>
which then works with a standard error checking convention<p><pre><code>  struct Foo *arr;
  err = MallocA(n,&arr);CHK(err);
</code></pre>
This doesn't work in C++ without non-portable typeof or evil and less safe (not conforming for function pointers)<p><pre><code>  *(void**)(p) = malloc((n)*sizeof(**(p)))
</code></pre>
Similarly, if a client registers a callback with a context, I store their context in a void* and pass it back to them<p><pre><code>  int UserCallback(void *ctx,...) {
    struct User *user = (struct User*)ctx;
</code></pre>
instead of<p><pre><code>  int UserCallback(void *ctx,...) {
    struct User *user = ctx;
</code></pre>
I understand that this is just cosmetic.  I don't see how ""going generic full speed"" helps with this.  Also note that aggregate returns are slower for all but trivially small structures, and downright bad for big structures.",1290630263

I don't review cryptosystems for a living.<p>I guess my point was that most of the cryptosystems /I've/ used over the years have seen significant vulnerabilities exposed in key management and side channel attacks.  Insufficient entropy for key generation is another one.

1938383,comment,1936990,1936990,0,0,dionysiac,,,"IMO, A big danger of implementing centralized authentication across multiple sites is that will make social engineering schemes aimed at stealing a user's credentials more plausible and effective.<p>I know that systems such as OpenID and others perform authentication directly between the user and thetrusted provider (google, facebook, twitter, etc), and that the site ends up with a one-time token that confirms the user's identity. The site requesting authentication never gets the actual password to the openID account, which makes this approach viable in a technical security sense.<p>But here's the thing: <i>general users are getting used to entering their centralized credentials to perform actions on untrusted sites</i>. Technical users understand the design. We can confirm that, yes, TwitScoop does indeed direct us to twitter.com/oauth/... (no HTTPS, but that's another story).<p>Regular users posting a comment on a blog, though, don't see any difference between giving their credentials to a trusted Google login site and entering their credentials into some form on a blog.<p>If, for example, logging in with Facebook credentials becomes common, it would be trivial to create a rogue blog which collects login information. Fill it with a few incendiary posts, possibly create an official-looking Facebook login page that doesn't display its URL, and it would be possible to capture quite a few sets of credentials.",1290628974

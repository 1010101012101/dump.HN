I always read how he was the ""father of MacIntosh"" but after you read more you realize that was never the case.<p>""For instance, if the user simply started typing it would switch into editor mode, and if they typed numbers it would switch to calculator mode. In many cases these switches would be largely invisible to the user.""<p>Ouch... talk about doing way too much. This would drive most people insane. We should all be thankful to Jobs that he took over MacIntosh team and never implemented any of this stuff.",1196041290

After all was said (obscenities/what-I-would-do-if-I-caught-theif) and done, it was gone: stolen, I assume, from my jeep. What do you guys do to ensure that this doesn't happen, and if it does, what recourse do you have? I have no idea where it was stolen, (at work, parents house, or coffee/book shop).<p>I really, really wish I had thought about this and bought LoJack or insured it on my car insurance or something, but I didnt :(.<p>Anyone have similar horror stories?",1196039998

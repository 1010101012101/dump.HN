The MVP is the first question you ask your users ""Is this what you want?"".

I'm in a business where face-to-face sales doesn't matter.  the value is in the price and reliability.   I mean, if someone else wants to build something better and cheaper,  I might have a problem, but I don't think anyone would get very far just calling my customer list.<p>Also, when I do advertise, or ""sell"" I mostly focus on brand building rather than selling to individual customers, and I own the brand much more than I own the customer list.<p>If more of my perceived value was in individual customer sales, of course, this would be different.<p>You do bring up an interesting point, though.  most of the people I do this with, I can train, to some extent.  I mean, every now and again I'll find a webapp dev who is better than I am at that right off the bat, but most people I've hired required some training from me to get to that point, so it might be that you need to do this with people in your skill area?  on the other hand it sounds like you've got some basic tech skills, so it's probably worth a shot.<p>The closest thing to biz types I've hired are accountants and bookkeepers.

Same with Facebook, except that they don't even have that policy. :)<p>For #2, I am by no means trying to fuel some conspiracy theory, but I often wonder if these companies aren't at least partially funded by organizations that would benefit from the information collected. Obviously on the books their stated customers are primarily advertisers, but why wouldn't the CIA, NSA, and every other government's intelligence agency want access to these data sources, and what wouldn't they do to get access to them? I'm not against our government doing what they need to in order to protect us, so it isn't a criticism, but I wonder why I don't see this brought up more often- again, not as a conspiracy theory, but as a legitimate concern/question.

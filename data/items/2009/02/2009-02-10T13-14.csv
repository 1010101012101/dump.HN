While the tools may have deeper option sets, hobbyists may take years to discover them.  It's rare that a program comes along which allows you to have in infinite amount of sounds to choose from and allows anyone to think of creative ways to recycle existing recordings.

475134,comment,474919,474919,0,0,iamwil,,,"As a disclosure, I've been using Ruby for the past three years, and it's about as object-y as you can get.  However, Ruby opened my eyes a bit to exploring other languages.  Point is, as I started looking at other languages in depth, I found myself using objects a little bit less, especially in the design pattern sense.  Some problems in the traditional 23 design patterns just disappear in dynanmic languages.  After programming in Lua and Javascript, I find objects nice, but optional.<p>Nowadays, I sort of just use classes to scope and namespace.  I keep state in classes when it makes sense.<p>To counter the point about state, Erlang programs do have state.  They're just contained locally within a function.  Since Erlang has tail recursion, you just call the same function recursively and pass the state variable you want to keep at the very end of the function for the lifetime of the program.  Because it's tail recursion, there's no stack overflow.  Also, Erlang threads can keep 'state' inside of the Mnesia database that comes with Erlang.<p>State is only evil when it's shared.  Because state is contained locally in a function, a single Erlang thread can do whatever it wants, whenever it wants with those variables.  Threads communicate through message passing.  Therefore, no need for locks, mutexes or semaphores.  Along with the low overhead of thread creation (~300 bytes) they're part of the reason why Erlang has great concurrency properties.",1234273798

True, anything that helps us helps our customers, but I'd prefer to ask a more basic question...<p>If we have so many programmers that we need new technologies to work better together, are we doing something fundamentally too complex to begin with?  Most of us aren't working on the space shuttle.  We're doing relatively simple bread and butter apps moving data through logic.  Before we surrender to OO, maybe we should take a closer look at <i>why</i> we need ""easier and safer"" ways to work together.  For most of us, a simpler approach than OO often makes more sense.  I suspect that's OP's biggest point.",1234273712
475132,comment,474816,474928,0,0,3pt14159,,,"This is downright wrong. We aren't poor at all, we are just less irresponsible.<p>Some facts plagiarized & reworded from a variety of sources: 
(And just to make things easier, and less prone to stock market crashes I've leaned towards 2005/2006 numbers. Things just get worse for Americans as you bring that year forward.)<p>- 1 - 
As of 2005, the median family in Canada was worth US$122,600, according to Statistics Canada, while the U.S. Federal Reserve pegged the median American family at US$93,100 in 2004.<p>- 2 -
In Canada the average amount of personal debt per person is US$23,460. In the U.S. it's a whopping US$40,250. (2005 numbers)<p>- 3 -
In Canada the average amount of personal debt per person is US$23,460. In the U.S. it's US$40,250. (2005) Here many people view non-mortgage debt as a unwieldy burden that needs to be paid off right away. $23k is not really that much in the grand scheme of things.<p>- 4 - 
The average Canadian worker puts in 35 hours of work per week, while Americans put in 38. Only 30 per cent of Canadians work 45 hours a week or more, compared to 38 per cent of Americans. (2004) Now I happen to work more than 45 hours a week, and I don't find it a problem at all, but when you're looking at standard of living you have to take this into account. Also we get almost 17 vacation days a year, and we take, on average, nearly 16 of those days. In the U.S., the average is 14 days, but Americans only take 11.<p>- 5 - 
Our future obligations are funded (mostly), while America has $55+ trillion (net present value, meaning this will be much higher in the future with interest) or $184,000 per man, woman, child in total FEDERAL obligations, let alone state debt and future obligations as well as a crumbling infrastructure.<p>- 6 - 
There are plenty of banks in Canada for Pete's sake.
See for yourself:
<a href=""http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/bank/Toronto,+ON"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/bank/Toronto,+ON</a>
To say that we are 'enslaved' by our banks is just irresponsible internet talk; unless you mean we actually make our payments on time, which we do.<p>- 7 - 
Our student loans are much more under control too.
Average Canadian student debt, among those who borrow AND graduate from four-year programs, regardless of how long it takes to actually graduate: $22,700<p>Now don't get me wrong, there are somethings that really, really bug me about Canadians (drug use here among people under 30), but when it comes to our financials we are on (relatively) solid ground.",1234273668

475119,comment,475005,475005,0,0,yters,,,"The problem is that once they stop calling it Darwinism, what do you call it, to keep it distinct from ID?  They can't just call it evolution, since IDers don't all deny common descent, old earth, etc. and can thus claim the evolution label for their theories.  It has to be called something like ""evolution only by natural selection"" or ""natural evolution"" or somesuch.  But then this sounds too restrictive and gives popular credence to the ID rhetoric of ""why are evolutionists so cloes minded?""<p>An added problem is that ID doesn't even have to appeal to a god or aliens.  They can just restrict their theory to a more Lamarckian idea, that animals genetically engineer themselves, either intentionally or by happenstance.  Once they do this, then the theory fits entirely within a naturalistic paradigm.<p>So, I'd say the essay is right.  Darwinism has a problem of rhetoric on its hands.",1234272677

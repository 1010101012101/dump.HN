And then Congress immediately updated the letter of the law, unanimously, all the while explaining how it&#x27;s unfortunate the previous letter of the law didn&#x27;t capture the spirit of what they intended, specifically mentioning this case.<p>Also, the &quot;it&#x27;s just a notebook with scribbled down thoughts&quot; analogy is poor. That implies that it&#x27;s just his own thoughts he took. He uploaded 500,000+ lines of source code, then tried to cover up his tracks.

9047103,comment,9045305,9045305,0,0,groovylick,,,"I returned to Firefox from Chrome about 1 year ago due to nagging rendering bugs with linux.  Running out of video memory triggered a bug where Chrome would leave a stale buffer of the window on screen.  My inputs still got to browser, I could change tabs, scroll, go full-screen it just won&#x27;t repaint the window.  I would have to restart my window manager to get it to repaint.  The only solution was to disable GPU rendering but then scrolling was terrible.  I know I was pushing the limits of my 7 year old Thinkpad, but I liked my keyboard and 3 real mouse buttons. I moved to Firefox and even with GPU rendering enabled never had that problem.<p>Months later that Thinkpad&#x27;s battery died and I moved to working on a modern dual monitor desktop machine.  Thinking my problems with Chrome would be gone with plenty of horsepower I discovered a new bug.  My monitors are (unfortunately) BGR pixel order not much much more common RGB.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to setup in Cinnamon/Gnome just change 1 dconf key and font rendering is great.  Chrome completely ignores this setting and renders fuzzy haloed fonts, plus it not just for Linux, Chrome does the same under Windows.  The best workaround is to enable grayscale sub-pixel rendering in chrome://flags but fonts are still fuzzy.  From what I found while debugging the problem Chrome used to support different pixel orders but broke it recently.<p>Once again Firefox renders fonts just fine by reading the pixel order set by the OS.  Chrome isn&#x27;t alone in the pixel order problems, Sublime Text and Atom both suffer from the same problem.",1423860614

Many older technologies (USENET, commercial unices, IRC, etc) were limited only to people with the extreme privilege to be connected to certain groups who were aware of the existence of a technology, and had the knowledge to know how to set it up, what was available to connect to, and how to deal with problems (often consisting of orally-transmitted secrets and esoterica).<p>I&#x27;ve personally struggled with this; as a young teenager, I tried to learn C++ without any access to the internet, any mentor; just a few old books.  I struggled with it for years and ultimately failed because certain technical obstacles couldn&#x27;t be overcome without &quot;in-group&quot; knowledge that didn&#x27;t exist in the meager documentation I could find.  Either you were part of the social group that could help you out of your problem, or you effectively were not privileged to use the technology.<p>IRC is symbolic to me of this sort of old-school &quot;it works fine for us&quot; mentality that poisoned the early tech enclaves - their myopic failure to include anyone who didn&#x27;t win the social lottery of knowing the right people, or growing up in the right place.  It&#x27;s not that it worked for them that I begrudge - it&#x27;s their assumption that things must also be working for the rest of humanity, since they themselves were doing just fine.

At approximately 5:20 p.m., just before his going-away party, Aleynikov encrypted and uploaded to a server in Germany more than 500,000 lines of source code for Goldman’s HFT system, including code for a substantial part of the infrastructure, and some of the algorithms and market data connectivity programs.&quot;  [Page 5].<p>&quot;Aleynikov also transferred some open source software licensed for use by the public that was mixed in with Goldman&#x27;s proprietary code.  However, a substantially greater number of the uploaded files contained proprietary code than had open source software.&quot;  [Page 5, Footnote 1].<p>He was convicted for violating the NSPA (National Stolen Property Act) and the EEA (Economic Espionage Act). The conviction for the former was vacated because the Second Circuit construed the NSPA not to extend to intangible property.  [Page 18-19].  And the EEA conviction was vacated because the statute requires the product to be &quot;produced for&quot; or &quot;placed in&quot; interstate commerce, while Goldman never intended to sell or license the software.

9046938,comment,9043524,9045832,0,0,mooxie,,,"You make a good point about the logic of such problems, and that certainly is a pain-point of these systems. I agree wholeheartedly.<p>However, having used Wink devices and being a minor-league programmer, I can tell you that the crux of the author&#x27;s issue should not be mistaken to be a misunderstanding of how to &#x27;program&#x27; actions on the device. The logic is there - it just often simply does not work correctly due to various issues; some obvious, some not.<p>For instance, geofencing on Wink simply does not work reliably, as mentioned in the article. No matter how you set up your routines, location-based events won&#x27;t work if the app does not correctly gauge/communicate your location.<p>Also problematic is that your routines are stored on your phone - not on the Wink Hub (basically a &#x27;dumb&#x27; radio) - so if you set a timed event but your phone is off or you have no service, the event does not trigger.<p>Everything is further complicated by the fact that your commands are not sent from the app to your device - they are sent from your phone to Wink servers, and then to your device. If their servers are down, experiencing latency, or your home connection is fubar, or your cell service is slow, or your DNS won&#x27;t allow you to tunnel out and back in with your phone on wireless, or packets are dropped somewhere en route - it is simply not going to work.<p>Finally, there is a ridiculous lack of information in error-handling. Sometimes the hub just does not want to work. With no web-based GUI, inconsistent alert LEDs that simply mean &#x27;something is wrong&#x27;, and even a reset button that does not actually perform a reset, even the most avid DIY-er is at a loss. Case in point: to truly reset your hub&#x27;s network settings, Wink recommends that you <i></i>change your home wifi network&#x27;s name<i></i> so that the hub will not be able to reconnect and will eventually reset itself. The inset &#x27;reset&#x27; button only power-cycles the device.<p>With problems like the above, understanding the logic behind your comings and goings is a moot point - you can spend hours working with the thing and, as mentioned by the author, suddenly start to appreciate your light switches.",1423858840

On June 2, 2009, Aleynikov flew ..... to Chicago to attend meetings at Teza. He brought with him a flash drive and a laptop containing portions of the Goldman source code.

[n]evertheless, while concurring [in the opinion], I wish to express the hope that Congress will return to the issue and state, in appropriate language, what I believe it meant to make criminal in the EEA.</i><p>Specifically the EEA used to say &quot;included in a product that is produced for or placed in&quot; interstate commerce, which the court thought didn&#x27;t technically cover HFT code, and now reads &quot;a product or service used in or intended for use in&quot;.

I think it&#x27;s aggressive, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unrealistic. Personally I had hoped for a late June/early July release to give more time to solidify the docs and to shake out bugs in the compiler.<p>There will definitely be people who say that the release is premature, but I&#x27;m personally not one of them. The core of the language is ready, even if some pieces around the edges could still use some refinement (and will see refinement, backwards-compatibly, in the coming releases).<p><pre><code>  > I&#x27;m surprised at how aggressive the release schedule is,

You&#x27;d be surprised at how much of a motivator a concrete release date is. :) Churn is happening now <i>because</i> of the impending release, not despite it. The language intends to have a solid compatibility story (via semver) for post-1.0 releases, so everyone who&#x27;d been holding off on changes for the past few years has suddenly come out of the woodwork to implement them.",1423857801

However, the pop-up flash button on the pentaprism hump firmly places these cameras as crop-sensor. The lenses match the Canon 70-300 non-L series. Sub-model distinction solely through cosmetics is difficult.<p>2. In the second picture the body is obscured by the owner&#x27;s hand. However, the paint job of the lens clearly marks it as a Canon L-series telephoto. Judging from the size and twin focus/zoom rings, this lens is likely a Canon 70-200 F2.8. Sub-model distinction is again difficult at this resolution.<p>3. This camera is difficult, although clearly a Nikon. The label placement and lack of sync ports suggest a crop sensor model, but the left-side dial contradicts this. The high label disqualifies most options. The only seemingly plausible option is the rather old D200 (from 2005). The lens is also difficult, as the gold ring and dual control rings suggest a typical telephoto (70-200), but the lack of internal zooming contraindicates this. It could be an 80-400, but the size is a bit off. Hard to say.",1423857636

To the point where I am wondering if this is a bug, because the memory would just not be reclaimed by the browser until I forced it through the developer console: upon clicking the trash can in the Timeline tab, 60 MB were re-claimed for one of the extension (from ~130MB to 70MB). This was after waiting for an hour to see if it would be reclaimed. Yes, there was a lot of idle time while I waited.<p>[1] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=441500</a>",1423857619

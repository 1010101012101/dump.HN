It will be very difficult because, in the brain, every molecule is a powerful computer and we would need to simulate the structure and function of trillions upon trillions of molecules as well as all the rules that govern how they interact. You would literally need computers that are trillions of times bigger and faster than anything existing today.</i><p>Because this will only be an approximation, it means that certain hard-to-define grammatical properties of spike-trains (e.g. ""neural codes"" as opposed to ""rate codes"") may be completely lacking in the simulation.  Do these ""neural codes"" exist?  At this point we do not know.<p>If it turns out that the brain does utilize complex neural codes, and that they are not being accounted for in the simulation, then the simulation can be no more than gibberish which happens to share many low-order statistical features with the real thing.<p>To illustrate this point, here are some examples of pseudo-English sentences automatically generated by a purely statistical model (n-gram model where n=2):<p><i>Richard Beesemyers, formerly raised sagging candidate to the Friday officially forecast at the project.</i><p><i>A hearing appeals.</i><p><i>That bank handles most notable exceptions to buy time for reconsideration Wednesday in decades, is the B& Coopers, to discuss international theme for the violin away as the wages of the power plant near classic chemise.</i><p><i>It could have been observing the 65 to back Tuesday.</i><p><i>And fourth, there is a full report, Wagner said.</i>",1241199013

Having some of the mental faculties tapped by IQ tests generally results in more accumulation of the kind of knowledge imparted by school lessons or self-study, so that adult IQ tests have a lot of item content that consists of tests of knowledge.<p>But cognitive psychologists point out that intelligence (I would say ""IQ"") does not imply rationality.<p><a href=""http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300123852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=97803001238...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psychology/dp/030012385X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/What-Intelligence-Tests-Miss-Psycholog...</a><p>The behavioral economists who study judgment under uncertainty repeatedly replicate results showing that high-IQ individuals are very capable of making irrational, inexpedient decisions. And even when challenged about those decisions, most people persist in their irrational thinking.<p>There is also a widely replicated result in psychological research showing that most people overestimate their competence in most domains.<p><a href=""http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect</a><p>So it shouldn't suprise any of us that most online discussion consists of people expressing opinions that they are more confident about than is warranted by the evidence supporting the opinions.<p><i>Ultimately you have to judge any argument by what it says, not who said it.</i><p>This is the best cultural way that HN can support the development of rationality among its participants. It happens that I am self-taught in the psychological literature I have just mentioned. I am fortunate, in my community service work, to have acquaintance with several Ph.D. psychologists who provide me with reading suggestions and bounce ideas off me. They like the working paper on IQ testing I presented in public in 2006, and they encourage me to keep on researching. I in turn like all HN participants to feel free to ask follow-up questions asking for evidence and checking assumptions and logic as each HN participant posts opinions. I think Matt's point in the submitted article is well taken--law is a specific body of knowledge (a body of knowledge in which I DO have a credential and work experience), and many guesses about what the law is made by laymen are not correct.

One observation:<p>If, as Matt describes, an executive at a major music label realized the emerging trends of the industry but chose the path that would maximize his stock options over the next 2-3 years at the long-run expense of the stockholders, this would be illegal, and not constitute the ""no-brainer"" decision that Matt describes.<p>Executives have a fiduciary duty to stockholders to place long-run stockholder interest above their own. In fact, if this was found to be the case, he would most likely lose these options as well as suffer other legal ramifications. (disclaimer: not a lawyer, I just read blogs about lawyers :) You can argue that executives rarely do this, but nonetheless the legal obligation exists. I would like to think that those executives who take the attitude of ""i just want to get my money and run, who cares about the long-term state of the corporation"" is the minority, rather than the majority.",1241198315

One reason is that it is easy to get lost in details of complicated data structures and control flow; we find stepping through a program less productive than thinking harder and adding output statements and self-checking code at critical places. Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is. More important, debugging statements stay with the program; debugging sessions are transient.<p>* * *<p><a href=""http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html</a>",1241197994

The biggest problem I ran into was that if you wanted the full history of X/Y/Z.json to contain the full history of Z.json, even if it had been moved, it ended up requiring two parallel structures.  One structure with directories for the tree data, one for the raw data of that node.<p>My intent was to use it in a document system using Operational Transforms, which side-stepped the issue of concurrent access; only the canonical representation of client data would need to be written, so it was serial writing",1290427148

I've certainly never used it. Keeping 'webby' is hugely important - and not in conflict with my first point - because there are two relevant points to be aware of when implementing a UI: Firstly you're teaching users how to use the web, and secondly when you implement a UI you can expect (but not require) users to use it in the same way they use other web apps.

Why do I have to contend with arguments like this every time to this topic comes up?<p>""But,"" you say, ""Hashing a value is O(k), where k is at least log n.  Therefore hash tables only support O(log n) access and update, not O(1).""  It's become a quite fashionable gotcha, as your upvotes indicate.<p>The problem is, it's wrong.  It's correct in a vacuous, put-it-in-a-footnote sense, but not in any real sense, the way we actually talk about data structures in computer science.<p>We have a longstanding tradition in computer science of ignoring the O(k) operations that you want to ascribe to hashing.  The most relevant example of where we ignore that factor is in--you guessed it--balanced binary trees used as dictionaries.  Comparison, like hashing, is also O(k), where k is >= log n.  So in the technical sense you're espousing, a balanced binary tree would offer O(log n log n) access and update, rather than the O(log n) access and update that everyone describes it as.<p>Of course, in reality, everyone considers comparison to be O(1), and thus they say that balanced binary trees have O(log n) lookup.  Likewise, everyone considers hashing to be O(1) since it's in the same class of operations as comparison, and thus they say that hash tables have O(1) lookup.  This is how the real world of computer science actually talks about things, fashionable Internet objections notwithstanding.<p>(This is all covered in CLRS, of course, but no one seems to be able to look things up in books anymore.  ""We assume that the hash value h(k) can be computed in O(1) time...If the number of hash-table slots is at least proportional to the number of elements in the table, we have `n = O(m)` and, consequently, `alpha = n/m = O(m)/m = O(1)`.  Thus, searching takes constant time on average.  Since insertion takes O(1) worst-case time and deletion takes O(1) worst-case time when the lists are doubly linked, all dictionary operations can be supported in O(1) time on average."")",1290424595

1929406,comment,1925744,1928417,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>On the surface that may seem like a perfectly rational standpoint. The reason why it's part of a superstitious belief is how that idea links up with other ideas. You are not arguing based on social data, but rather the abstract idea of what America is and for better or worse that's an superstitious argument.</i><p>In addition to resolving my own health issues, I have also raised two ""twice exceptional"" kids (gifted and learning disabled).  The more gifted of the two was never identified by the public school system as gifted.  He was always in special ed.  My sons and I have walked away from a conventional lifestyle much as early immigrants walked away from the lifestyle of their native lands to come here.  Europeans generally don't understand quite a few things about American culture, including the gun culture here.  But Europe killed off most of its deadly animals a long time ago.  We still have bears and wolves and poisonous snakes. We also have a lower population density, which means that if you get into trouble, you are more likely to have to deal with it yourself.  There may be no one to call upon, much less police to intercede.<p>Additionally, studies show that Americans generally view more space around them as ""theirs"".  One study found that some criminals in jail claimed such a large space around them as ""theirs"" that you basically couldn't be in the same room without them feeling you were in their space.  This likely was a factor in their generally aggressive/violent reactions to things that wouldn't provoke others.  The fact that Americans tend to claim so much more body space than Europeans or Middle Easterners may be part of why we are viewed as ""the ugly Americans"" -- it likely causes us to start conversations with people whom we think are ""in our space"" but who view us as butting in inappropriately.  This view of or need for more space may well be due to physiological wiring, not just culture.  It may well be part of why Americans prefer to spread out and create suburban sprawl rather than live in denser urban settings.<p>That is just a few examples.  I don't think my assessment that Americans on the whole are likely wired differently from other people is simply superstitious.  There is substantial evidence that we are misfits and loners and overly aggressive by the standards of more ""civilized"" cultures.  We are mavericks and discoverers and explorers.  This may be part of why we were the first to make it to the moon.  Those traits are not simply pathological, with no good in them.  But they do cause enormous problems in some settings.  And there is substantial evidence that traits like that are rooted in physiology -- that ""mental"" differences are rooted in physiological differences (such as brain wiring).<p>FWIW:  My medical diagnosis is ""atypical cystic fibrosis"".  The typical prognosis for CF is that you get gradually sicker and sicker until infection has eaten away your lungs and you qualify for a lung transplant or die.  I am not using diet and lifestyle to seek some kind of peak performance from a place of basic wellness.  I have used them to stop being bedridden, close the hole in my left lung, get off 8 or 9 prescription drugs, get well enough to work a full time paid job for the first time in my life, and get well enough to live without a car and get around mostly on foot.<p>Peace.",1290424249

He looks for people who can get things done on their own without too much guidance, always pays over-market rates for pay but makes the bulk of compensation based on net profit, and he primarily recruits people from bars where expats hang out. First thing he does when he reaches a new city is go to an English or Irish pub where the expats hang out, and gets lots of info there. He does lots of recruiting at bars, asking around for who knows who that'd be good at something. I'll ask him more next time I see him, and shoot you an email if I get something interesting and write it up.<p>Most of the people I've worked with I met and got to know beforehand... if possible, if you're a consumer-facing business, it would help to start building out a community around your business before looking to hire.

1591010,comment,1590503,1590807,0,0,ugh,,,"Sure, there are only liklihoods, I can never be absolutly sure of, well, anything, really. Defining 'truth' as something I am absolutly certain of wouldn't make much sense.<p>But why should I define 'truth' that way? I have no problem calling something 'true' which merely has a high enough liklihood. It's a useful approximation, it basically dichotomizes a scale which is quite often pretty useful.<p>I also don't have many semantic worries. We seem to be well aware of the double character of 'truth' and usually say something like 'absolute truth' when we refer to statements of which someone is absolutly certain.",1281434283
1591009,comment,1590755,1590958,0,0,silencio,,,"I hate having a huge stack of $1 bills even more, especially given the state of US paper bills now (hello wear and tear) and that they are identical in size and feel to all the other bills. When I was vacationing in Europe, I absolutely loved the euro and pound coins for their convenience of not having to dig through bills in my wallet (and the 1/2 euro coins especially, for the way they were executed). Nevermind that the bills too are a lot nicer than what the US has today, and we're barely catching up with this whole color thing.<p>I love the idea of $1 coins too, but I think they were badly executed in the US for a long time where the $1 coin was not much different in look and feel from a quarter. Nowadays it's really only that whole thing about retailers not wanting to accept it/customers not wanting to use it.<p>I think the US should make a huge push towards getting rid of the $1 and $2 bills in favor of coins. There's so many positives to this I can't even begin to imagine (for one, not having to carry around $10 worth of quarters to feed parking meters for a single hour where I don't necessarily feel like swiping my credit card...).",1281434270

1591007,comment,1586647,1590059,0,0,moe,,,"<i>It's not a new idea; this has been happening for far longer than either one of us has been alive.</i><p>Yes, I'm thinking of a bigger magnitude, though.<p>As naive as that may sound, I do believe in the ""service bot"" vision where households and workplaces are increasingly stuffed with robots. There's of course still a long way to go. But when I look at the individual pieces that are available today (see videos below) then I tend to, perhaps naively, expect the first robots capable of taking over simplistic jobs (outside of industrial environments) within a 15-20 year timeframe. And not long thereafter before it becomes cost effective to actually deploy them on a large scale.<p>When that happens then it will likely be a different quality from what we've seen in industrialism before. It's not about machines reducing the workforce in certain industries. It's about machines replacing human labor as a whole in entire segments - not least in the service-sector.<p>I'm deriving my guesstimate from the fact that what we see today is the result of the past circa 20 years of research. Add another 20yrs to that and the mind is blown, at least mine is.<p>With regard to ""not a new idea"" you have a point in theory. Yet in practice, when I listen to political discussions then I don't hear anyone having it on the radar, even when they talk about the so-called ""longterm"".<p>Perhaps I'm expecting too much, politicians rarely look further ahead than 10yrs anyways. I just wonder when we'll begin to seriously question the paradigm of ""everyone has a job"" which dominates everything today.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ByGQGiVMg#t=3m32s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9ByGQGiVMg#t=3m32s</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiw-jbjnyzc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wiw-jbjnyzc</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPAIpXm-nU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyPAIpXm-nU</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrmrU7P-ysA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrmrU7P-ysA</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhPLeIq4uY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwhPLeIq4uY</a>",1281434184

If I were in this position I might think of Singapore for instance.<p>If you are purely asking for a cheap jurisdiction to form a business entity, there is an endless supply of vendors on the Internet. I use BVI and Bahamas companies like cookies for my clients.<p>Buying a company is the trivial issue. The more important question is what you're going to do with it and what type of assets it will own. Look to home country regulation and taxation of your shiny Bahamas company in other words.<p>War story: I worked on an Internet gambling migration a few years ago (moving the business out of the US). There is a US tax rule that says transferring ownership of intangible property to a foreign owner (eg from your own US corporation to yor own Bahamas corporation) is treated like a sale. Imagine the capital gain on the domain name: bought for $7 per year and now the brand of a profitable business. Giant tax cost. Moral of the story: start with IP owned offshore while it is being developed.<p>The person asking the question shows a profile of living in Norway, so to you I would suggest looking at localtax rules and business regulation in Norway. Choosing the right starting point may save you orders of magnitude more money than the trivial expense of setting up a company.<p>Also the brain damage must be considered. I have lots of nonresident clients who buy US real estate. In almost every transaction the party onthe other side spazzes put when confronted with other than a domestic entity. I spend the front end of my time educating them. You will add to your transaction costs in time and money by using a nonlocal company. Unlike another commented in this thread I <i>ahem</i> have not had ease of use experiences with my bank (which happens to be Wells Fargo) and non-US corporations. Other banks too. The federally-mandates compliance costs for non-US transactions are too high. This may be true in Norway too. (I have a client who is the president of a business-only bank and even with that connection the bank won't take on my clients).",1281433785

As far as I can tell, it's all largely disconnected from the cost of creating the power, and if you are on the lowest residential tier, it's /very/ cheap.<p>Anyhow, if we roughly estimate the server to use the CPU TDP of power (now, CPUs don't normally use the full TDP... that's the design maximum.  Like sears horsepower, if the cpu itself hits that number, smoke is coming out of the thing.  but the rest of the server uses power, too-  the chipset, the ram, the network, the disk, etc... so  the TDP often is fairly close to what the whole server draws.)<p>that puts us at 94KwH for the server.  Multiply that by three to account for cooling, (in most data centers, you are looking at two watts plus in cooling for every one watt used by the servers.  This depends on how efficient the data center cooling system is.) and multiply that by your power number and that'd be around 58 euros a month.  19 euros if the place used zero power for cooling (but that's just unrealistic for something you can't turn off on hot days)<p>I would say there is something fishy here, but I've seen hetzner talked about here for a while, and people seem satisfied... so maybe I'm just missing something?",1281433274

1590940,comment,1588203,1588417,0,0,silencio,,,"This chair discussion and zed shaw's recent RSI discussion led me to looking at buying a new chair since my current one is giving me problems. I've settled on the Mirra, since I prefer it to an Aeron and I've found some reasonable deals for various colors of lightly used Mirra chairs on sites like ebay, craigslist, etc.<p>I'm sure a lot of others here looking to buy a chair are thinking of going the same route I am. Be aware that there is one <i>major</i> caveat emptor to buying a secondhand chair: Herman Miller's 12 year warranty <i>only</i> applies to the original purchaser that obtained the product from HM or an authorized reseller. Humanscale, Steelcase, Knoll, HON, and pretty much every other major task chair manufacturer has a similar warranty, and none of them will let you transfer the warranty AFAIK. Experiences with obtaining warranty service for secondhand Aerons and other chairs seems to vary, but please factor in the possibility that you may not be able to obtain service into the long-term cost of buying a used chair. If a trivial-over-12-years cost difference will give you peace of mind, go for it. Research a reseller before you buy anything from them. And so on.<p>If you weren't aware of this already, well, you can use it now to negotiate a lower price ;)<p>(Speaking of warranties, Costco sells some Herman Miller chairs as a legitimate authorized reseller. You can get the HM warranty and Costco's legendary return policy together that way, should anything with your chair go horribly wrong.)",1281431681

Portland prides itself on being at the forefront of urban planning, but when many of the roads were created in the perimeter of the city, there wasn't much thought put into it. The city has looked at retrofitting sidewalks into some of these areas, but it's prohibitively expensive.<p>Oddly enough, a lot of the neighborhoods weren't tightly packed. The lot sizes were decent and the house-to-house spacing was ample. I'm guessing it was more of an issue where, if the builders didn't have to spend money on sidewalks, they didn't.",1281431568

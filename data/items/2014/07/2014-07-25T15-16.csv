When they fail, it&#x27;s not about the details. (I don&#x27;t mind mistakes, although I do ask and see if the candidate can spot them when given a hint.) It&#x27;s amazing how many people completely and utterly fail at the task. They can&#x27;t produce a loop, they can&#x27;t come up with the necessary if statements, they can&#x27;t even explain in pseudocode or verbally which steps need to be taken. They don&#x27;t even know where to start. Sometimes it&#x27;s because of anxiety or stress, but usually when it&#x27;s an indication someone has no practical programming experience.",1406303915

We&#x27;ll default to no and let up later once we have some visibility.&quot;<p>However, if you want reasons:<p>1) Hazard to the uninvolved<p>A car is confined roughly to roads.  A car failing on a road is unlikely to deviate much from the road (likely to encounter telephone poles, trees, curbs, guardrails, etc.) and is unlikely to kill unrelated people even it it hurts another motorist.<p>A drone falling from the sky is a hazard to non-drone people--when it fails it <i>IS</i> coming out of the sky.<p>Sure, you could confine the drones to over roads, but the disruptive effects, as you point out, are mostly about <i>NOT</i> being confined to a road.<p>2) Liability<p>How do you trace that failed drone back to the person controlling it?  It&#x27;s wireless.  Now all drones need to be registered.<p>3) Autonomy<p>Do you want a drone to have some autonomy?  Before you say no, I would personally rather have a functioning drone fly home safely if it loses radio link rather than drop out of the sky.  Who&#x27;s responsible for that autonomy?<p>4) Collisions<p>Drones would be a huge hazard near where planes are flying.  Sure, banning drones near airports can be done.  However, commercial airplanes have fairly heavily traffic corridors by virtue of the ATC system, and some of the corridors go over land in the middle of nowhere where drones would like to be operating.<p>5) Law enforcement/military<p>Drones render terrain control suspect.  This has <i>NOT</i> sunk in to most law enforcement (and probably not much military, either, since the US hasn&#x27;t yet fought an enemy armed with drones of its own.).  Using a drone to put even something as simple as a flashbang <i>behind</i> a police line would cause total chaos.  Police are used to winning by surrounding--smaller overall force, but only deployed as a greater number against a smaller number in terrain control.  Drones can come from any direction, can be totally automated, and are extremely hard to target (we use shotguns for bird hunting instead of rifles for a reason).  I would be stunned if some of the drug gangs aren&#x27;t already deploying drones--we&#x27;re talking about people who deploy <i>submarines</i> for crying out loud.<p>There are good reasons for the FAA to knee-jerk to &quot;NO!

Mixing in voluntary work would be very difficult, also because individual volunteers in general aren&#x27;t dependable enough for anything that is really necessary.<p>If you want to do something small but that could bring results for sure, my suggestion is to contact some individual department and offer to do for them something that is &quot;nice to have&quot; but they don&#x27;t have the resources to do. Very often (at least here) the cultural departments have little resources, many small projects/events, and it would be easy to create for example a website/page/small tool.<p>If instead you would like to do something with a bigger impact, I think you could evaluate collaboration with other developers for some open-source building blocks for software pieces needed by most public administrations.

The style of GUI that came out of PARC is no longer &quot;modern&quot;, and has problems with modern development styles (e.g, single-threaded global event loops makes writing concurrent programs difficult).<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar with it, Gezira is a full vector graphics API, including compositing, written in less than a thousand lines of Nile - a small flow-based programming language. It does its magic by treating quadratic bezier curves as the main primitive, where the author has developed an algorithm to calculate the pixel coverage of a given bezier, with anti-aliasing.. Because most operations can be treated independently, it lends itself nicely to concurrency - each operation in a data flow can run independently, and many operations can be parallelised if given sufficient inputs.<p>Gezira/Nile was created by Dan Amelang while working for VPRI (the research institute headed by Alan Kay). A demo of it in action can be seen here: (<a href=""http://tinlizzie.org/~bert/Gezira.ogv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinlizzie.org/~bert/Gezira.ogv</a>), where it&#x27;s worth noting that the entire Editor UI in this example (after first 5 seconds), including font rendering, is written with Gezira itself.",1406302389

Let&#x27;s take a simplistic look at what their earnings would have looked like last year if they had only spent half as much on R&D ($6.565B) with no adverse affect to their bottom line. Add $3.283B to their actual net income of $0.274B for a total of $3.557B of potential earnings. Taking their current market cap of $146.58B (after today&#x27;s 11.19% drop) and that still gives them a P/E of 41x. Obviously, these numbers are pretty rough, but even if they had spent $0 on R&D, they&#x27;d still have a pretty high P/E.<p>Maybe the share price is hurting more because the market is actually taking a 2nd look at the valuation, and not because they didn&#x27;t realize what Amazon&#x27;s strategy was.",1406301783

Ford Motor Company was a 1919 decision of the Michigan Supreme Court. The opinion’s status as a meaningful legal precedent on the issue of corporate purpose is tenuous at best. Yet, its facts “are familiar to virtually every student who has taken a course in corporate law.” As Stout has observed in the past, “[t]he case is old, it hails from a state court that plays only a marginal role in the corporate law arena, and it involves a conflict between controlling and minority shareholders” more than an issue of corporate purpose generally. The chapter explains quite well that any idea that corporate law, as a positive matter, affirmatively requires companies to maximize shareholder wealth turns out to be spurious. In fact, none of the three sources of corporate law (internal corporate law, state statutes and judicial opinions) expressly require shareholder primacy as most typically describe it. To the contrary, through the routine application of the business judgment rule, courts regularly provide prophylactic protection for the informed and non-conflicted decisions of corporate boards&quot;<p>[1] &quot;The Shareholder Value Myth: How Putting Shareholders First Harms Investors, Corportations, and the Public&quot; by Lynn Stout <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Shareholders/dp/1605098132"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Shareholder-Value-Myth-Sharehold...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arizonastatelawjournal.org/book-review-the-shareholder-value-myth-how-putting-shareholders-first-harms-investors-corporations-and-the-public-by-lynn-stout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arizonastatelawjournal.org/book-review-the-shareholde...</a>",1406301429

Fuel isn&#x27;t that big a deal when combined with all of these other items.<p>Also, nuclear reactors were replaced with gas turbines in surface ships.  Nuclear is attractive versus the older oil-fired boilers.  Large gas turbines changed the calculus.  The steaming range of cruisers and destroyers with gas turbine power plants is excellent, hence the reason fuel is not a big deal to add to all the other stuff that needs to be provided for the battle group.",1406300849

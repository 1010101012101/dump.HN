You mean you never taught people the difference?<p>No, why should I, it is all C++.<p>It might be called struct, but only the keyword is the same, the semantics are quite different.<p>So why bother students heads with needless details how a C compiler sees a struct and a C++ sees a struct?<p>A struct is a class with default public access, that is all.<p>> You can&#x27;t properly explain the existence of the struct data type without C, this is nothing to do with FORTRAN.<p>Why? It is a C++ data type. Why should I use another programming language to explain it?<p>>  If you do not understand C, you cannot understand C++.<p>I wonder how my students could manage their exams.<p>You have to learn C++ relation to computer hardware and the design decisions behind it.<p>This means computer architecture and Assembly, C is not required.<p>Sure one can explain that some decisions are related to the desire to have C++ interoperate with zero attrition in the C Eco-system, but that isn&#x27;t required to explain C++ language features.<p>Do you also want people to learn C before C# and D?<p>Keywords and programming concepts are common across programming languages.",1418219949

On desktop? On touch devices?<p>For us developers, a command line and vim (or emacs, not trying to start a war) can be the epitome of UX -- once we learn all those shortcuts.<p>But for users, there&#x27;s a lot more that comes into play. Indicating to a user when something can be interacted with and - more importantly, many times - how it can be interacted with is very important. Usually such indications will also inform about what kind of result will happen from the interaction: will the form submit, will the page reload, will I see a list of additional options?<p>Just as important is indicating to the user that yes - you just interacted with something that can be interacted with. Depending on the action, this can be something as subtle as an underline - or as obvious as showing a loading indicator.<p>The Material animations aren&#x27;t just eyecandy for the sake of eyecandy. While touch screens are getting better, there are still situations where a touch doesn&#x27;t necessarily register as a touch. It&#x27;s super important to indicate to the user that a touch has been registered. It&#x27;s just as important that this happens immediately, instead of after - say - a round-trip request to a server somewhere.<p>If you&#x27;ve built and designed a user interface that has amazing affordances, a general perception of &#x27;speediness&#x27; even if the server is being slow, and treats touch users as a first-class citizen ...

8729061,comment,8723693,8728100,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"Nix packages live in isolated directories on a read-only filesystem and their build process is repeatable (usually; any exceptions are bugs!). This means that installing a Nix package will always give you the same result, and that result cannot be interfered with afterwards. Since everything&#x27;s isolated and read-only, changes are transactional.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say package A v1.0 is using some dependency B v3.0:<p><pre><code>    B v3.0 --> A v1.0
</code></pre>
Let&#x27;s say we want to update B to v3.1. Since the packages are read-only, we can&#x27;t touch any of B&#x27;s files at all. Instead, B v3.1 gets installed <i>alongside</i> the existing v3.0. A v1.0 doesn&#x27;t notice, since it&#x27;s still using v3.0:<p><pre><code>    B v3.0 --> A v1.0
    B v3.1
</code></pre>
We want A v1.0 to use this new version of B, but again we can&#x27;t touch any of its files. Instead, we install another copy of A v1.0 which uses B v3.1 as a dependency. Again, since they&#x27;re isolated these two copies of A v1.0 won&#x27;t interfere with each other:<p><pre><code>    B v3.0 --> A v1.0
    B v3.1 --> A v1.0
</code></pre>
So, how does the system know which copy of A to use? Firstly, Nix identifies packages by hashing them <i>and</i> their dependencies, which is why we can have two A v1.0 packages (there&#x27;s no unnecessary duplication; we only get two copies when something&#x27;s different). Secondly, each user has a &quot;profile&quot; listing which packages they want. So what&#x27;s a profile? It&#x27;s just another package. When you &quot;install&quot; a package, you&#x27;re actually just creating a new version of your profile package, which has different dependencies than the old version. Hence, a more complete version of the above diagram would be:<p><pre><code>    B v3.0 --> A v1.0 --> chris-profile-1
    B v3.1 --> A v1.0 --> chris-profile-2
</code></pre>
We can easily rollback changes by using a previous version of our profile package (it&#x27;s not even a &quot;rollback&quot; really, since the new profile is still there if we want it). To reclaim disk space we can do a &quot;garbage collection&quot; to get rid of old profile packages, then clean out anything which isn&#x27;t in the dependency graph of any remaining profile package.<p>To get two machines into the same state (the use-case of Puppet and friends), we just need to install the same profile package on each. There&#x27;s a Linux distro called NixOS which uses Nix to manage all of its packages and configuration.<p>In fact, since we can install multiple profile packages side-by-side, we can use profiles as a poor man&#x27;s container. They don&#x27;t offer strong protection, eg. in a shared hosting environment, but from a sysadmin perspective they give us some of the non-interference advantages (eg. no dependency hell, since there are no package conflicts or version-unification difficulties).<p>If we want a stronger containment system we can use NixOps, which gives Nix packages a Vagrant-like ability to provision and spin-up real or virtual machines, EC2 instances, etc. For example, we might have a &quot;DB server&quot; package.<p>If we want to orchestrate these services, we can turn them into Nix packages using DisNix; then we can have packages like &quot;Load Balancer&quot; which depends on &quot;Web Server&quot;, which in turn depends on &quot;Users DB&quot;.<p>I have to admit I&#x27;ve not used NixOps or DisNix, but I do use NixOS as my main OS and have grown to love it :)",1418218828

This is a test of delivery format.<p>There still are benefits to using 24-bit audio in the recording and processing stages. This is in large part due to most recording systems expecting 0dbVU = -18dbFS and the subsequent processing that can bring the noise floor well into the audible range (dynamic range processors are notoriously effective at this, and heavily used in modern music). We could take a simple example of a snare drum being recorded at 16bit, being EQ&#x27;d with a +6db boost anywhere on the spectrum, then compressed with a reduction peaking around 10db (not uncommon). After brickwall limiting in the final mix, this track will easily have a noise floor (via quantization error only) > -68dbFS best case. (-96db starting. -12dbFs peaking snare, +6 + 10 to noise floor, assuming limiting with no gain reduction)  -68dbFS is already audible in a critical listening scenario. With dozens (sometimes hundreds) of uncorrelated signals being subjected to similar processing, this noise floor raises well into the audible range for even a modest playback system.<p>While I realize that delivery format is the only thing important to most people, it is important to differentiate since the article does make a point to separate out musicians, sound engineers and hardware reviewers. These are groups of people that _should_ be aware of the benefits of higher sample resolution. Since it&#x27;s fairly obvious that most people in these categories are confused about their ability to discern delivery formats, it&#x27;s not beneficial to confuse them even further about working formats.<p>To be more succinct, the difference between 16bit and 24bit is largely inaudible when the source material is worked in a higher resolution format and properly converted.",1418218439

Witness the number of people who will vigorously claim that Javascript implementations are &quot;as fast as C&quot;, despite in reality not being anywhere near that except in the aforementioned carefully-engineered benchmarks. <i>Especially</i> beware of &quot;adding integers in an array&quot;.

This is just throat clearing, not a description anymore, because nearly everything is &quot;easy to use&quot; and &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;MVC&quot;.

There&#x27;s a very interesting Web page illustrating the Coloured nature of bits in law on the US Naval Observatory Web site.  They provide information on that site about when the Sun rises and sets and so on...  but they also provide it under a disclaimer saying that this information is not suitable for use in court.  If you need to know when the Sun rose or set for use in a court case, then you need an expert witness - because you don&#x27;t actually just need the bits that say when the Sun rose.  You need those bits to be Coloured with the Colour that allows them to be admissible in court, and the USNO doesn&#x27;t provide that.  It&#x27;s not just a question of accuracy - we all know perfectly well that the USNO&#x27;s numbers are good.  It&#x27;s a question of where the numbers came from.  It makes perfect sense to a lawyer that where the information came from is important, in fact maybe more important than the information itself.  The law sees Colour.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a slightly different hypothetical. I tell a police officer: &quot;the blood on the carpet is that of the accused.&quot; A forensic scientist tells a police officer: &quot;the blood on the carpet is that of the accused.&quot; Are these the same bits? By the reasoning of the article, yes, but the law rightfully treats them completely differently. The source of the bits goes to reliability.<p>In fact, the disclaimer on the UNSO&#x27;s website explains why the data is not reliable for litigation: <a href=""http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/lawyers.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/lawyers.php</a> (&quot;The data are <i>computed</i> and are not reports of <i>observed or recorded</i> events. The computations assume certain conditions and the data might therefore not be relevant to the facts at issue in a specific case.&quot;). The mistake made by the author is precisely why courts are wary to take judicial notice of random facts on the internet--even when the data is accurate, it is easy to fail to take account of relevant limitations arising from the nature of the data or the data collection.<p>And contrary of the author&#x27;s assertion--computers care a lot about where bits come from. The whole point of things like GPG signatures on digital downloads is because we trust some sources and not other sources, even when the bits might seem to be the same.",1418217541

The signals we sampled were in hundreds of MHz but the concepts are exactly the same as in audio frequencies.<p>What we effectively did was use a pulsed fiber laser, which produces _very_ short pulse widths of light. Connecting this to an electro-optical modulator, we can effectively capture a very fast snapshot of the electrical signal. Use some analog circuitry to hold that level constant for the slower analog-to-digital conversion, and we had an AD converter that while sampling relatively  slowly, see&#x27;s only a tiny portion of the signal for it&#x27;s actually sample.<p>What was amazing about this was that the laser pulses were so short, and the &#x27;timing jitter&#x27; of the pulses so low that we could cleanly see the expected aliased sampling frequency when saming a sine wave signal at large multiples of our sample frequency (iirc up to the 40&#x27;s). Eg, inputting a sine wave around 10 GHZ and we&#x27;d see only a single sine wave in the sampled signal at it&#x27;s row sampled frequency with minimal artifacts.<p>So if you are wondering how aliasing affects audio samping, draw a sine wave and see what happens if you sample it at a much lower frequency. You&#x27;ll get a lower frequency sine wave. Without filtering the input signal, it&#x27;s impossible to tell if this is a real low-frequency sine wave or something above Nyquist that has been down sampled.<p>N.B. If you&#x27;re wondering why our AD converter was better than a commercial one, we also added optical demultiexing to get an extra order of magnitude improvement in sample rate. This is possible using our electro optical setup due to the laser&#x27;s low jitter and the ability to hold the signal steady, a purely electronic version will have difficulty with the timing to see much actual improvement in SNR.",1418217515

I agree with you that there is a sort of public good provided by taxis, but I disagree that it&#x27;s a natural monopoly of the kind that you mentioned.<p>There are varying strategies for solving the problem of social goods like utilities. In some cities, utilities like these are publicly owned, such as Seattle City Light.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that individual transportation services are sufficiently similar to utilities that they fall into this category. What utilities have in common is that they fundamentally share physical infrastructure: pipes, wires, etc. It does not make economic sense to run duplicate wires everywhere, and so we grant a monopoly to one utility company. By comparison, each private vehicle traveling along the road is physically distinct from all others. (There will certainly be economies to scale for a single organization to operate a larger fleet of vehicles, but that&#x27;s always true in every business.) Buses make sense to offer as a public good since they represent collective transportation; whereas private for-hire vehicles inherently offer individualized transportation. So it may be a public good, but it&#x27;s not quite collective nor a natural monopoly.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s inherently unreasonable for cities to want to ensure access to this type of individual transportation [1], but I question whether the current taxi model is the right one. What is the best way to meet these public needs? I don&#x27;t know for sure, but some attractive alternative approaches include: (1) offering a subsidy for private transportation companies to meet certain criteria (e.g., area coverage) (2) soliciting bids for private contracts with companies to provide the service under contract (3) directly providing the service (metro). Forcing companies to provide the service in order to get licensed to provide <i>other</i> services is heavy-handed and unjustified based on what I&#x27;ve learned so far.<p>I have not heard a convincing argument for why a company that wishes to provide some transportation services should also be forced to provide other transportation services at certain prices. The utility company should be forced to support everyone because we don&#x27;t want to dig up our roads over and over again, and because water and electricity are necessary for life, and sewer for sanitation reasons. The fire department should support everyone so that your house catching fire doesn&#x27;t cause mine to burn down. There are good public benefit arguments behind most of these utilities. Are private cars that drive you around really in the same category? And if they are, what stops cities from solving these problems with a much less heavy-handed approach that enables innovation?<p>Isn&#x27;t Uber serving taxi-like needs through UberX anyway? It&#x27;s not as if the poor would be without transport even if only Uber was available. Let&#x27;s allow private companies to provide what transportation they can.  The existence of these companies does not stop the city from offering alternative solutions for various market segments, or offering a subsidy to entice companies to meet those needs.<p>I would like to make one last argument against the current model. The current regulation model imposes a lot of costs on transportation companies that are effectively a hidden tax - when in any aspect of their operations they&#x27;re forced to do something unnatural. These costs surface through higher prices. However, these prices are opaque. A voter in the district can&#x27;t necessarily determine how much higher taxi prices are because of the city&#x27;s decision to force them to do <X>. This does not support an informed, rational democracy. Consider the alternative models I&#x27;ve proposed above. They all essentially include a contract where the city is providing a service directly, or paying a third party to do so. You can imagine computing a very clear line-item cost in the budget for each of the services that the city wishes to be provided. Consequently, voters in the district can learn about these costs transparently, and reason about whether the cost/benefit tradeoff makes sense to them. It is possible for voters to say, &quot;This service is too expensive - we should cease funding it&quot;. How could we determine whether certain requirements mandated under taxi regulation are too expensive? Does deciding to stop providing a service mean that the city needs to amend its law? (Inflexible and, again, heavy-handed.) The costs are known only to private companies, and even they might require actuarial analysis to understand the costs.<p>Whereas if you pay a private transportation service to offer subsidized taxi-like transportation in certain areas, in certain hours, then we know exactly what it costs, and we can make an informed decision about whether to continue to provide the service or not. Regulation requiring private companies to provide the service as part of other activities just obfuscates the cost and prevents us from reasoning about it intelligently, like in debates like this.<p>[1] In fact, I hope the city of the future will move away from buses, and move to automated fleets of something like robotic Uber, scheduled in real-time based on live transportation needs",1418217165

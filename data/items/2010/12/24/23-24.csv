No more need to find ways to scale your data solution. Less money, less fuss.<p>Saying that ""we're all about money"" is interesting, especially when you compare us to other cloud database providers, such as database.com, we are actually less expensive - by far - than they are. Further, you can sign up for free, get four times as much usage as they provide (just as an example) for free, and you get a staff of highly experienced database engineers behind you, 100%.<p>So, we solve the problem of scalability, cost, and time lost to trying to solve that problem yourself. In short, we save you money - lots of money.<p>Hopefully that addresses your questions :-)",1293234922

2038262,comment,2037484,2037484,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"Yup, that was a day one lesson in numerical linear algebra.<p>Another lesson:  At times will find that are forming 'inner products', that is, for some positive integer n and for, say, single precision, floating point a(i), b(i) for i = 1, 2, ..., n, computing<p>a(1) x b(1) + a(2) x b(2) + ,,, + a(n) x b(n)<p>Well, do that computation in double precision.  Convert the result back to single precision if necessary; still definitely, if possible do 'double precision inner product accumulation'.<p>Why?  The first rule of numerical analysis is to avoid the difference of two large numbers whose difference is small.<p>Why?  Because maybe 12345.6 and 12345.7 each have 6 decimal digits of precision but they differ by 0.1 which has only 1 significant digit of precision and, thus, is not very accurate and can feed inaccuracy into the subsequent calculations.<p>So, when accumulating an inner product, a product a(1) x b(1) is basically in double precision, so KEEP THOSE DIGITS, especially since the additions may be the small differences of large numbers.  So, by doing double precision inner product accumulation, have a chance of having full single precision accuracy for the result.<p>Next, when you have a solution x^1 to Ax = b, substitute and get Ax^1 = b^1, form c^1 = b - b^1 as an 'error', and then solve Ay^1 = c^1 and correct for the error by setting x^2 = x^1 + y^1.  So, if y^1 is accurate, then get<p>Ax^2 = A(x^1 + y^1) = b^1 + c^1 = b^1 + b - b^1 = b<p>Of course, could do several steps of iteration here.<p>This process is called 'iterative improvement'.<p>This and more are in<p>George E. Forsythe and Cleve B. Moler, 'Computer Solution of Linear Algebraic Systems', Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, 1967.<p>E.g., pay close attention to 'partial pivoting'.<p>Beware of the fact that Ax = b may have a solution but not a unique solution.  If this is the case in your problem, then it would be hopeless to look for A^(-1) yet a solution might still be easy to find.<p>Note that if there is a solution, then can (1) notice that each of the numbers is in 'floating point' and, thus, just an integer times a power of 2 (10, whatever, assume 2).  Thus, in Ax = b can multiply A and b by an appropriate power of 2 and, then, have a problem where all the given data is integers.  Then, for some positive integer m pick m single precision integer prime numbers and for each of these numbers, using only single precision integer arithmetic, solve the system in the integers modulo that prime where find multiplicative inverses using the Euclidean greatest common divisor algorithm.  Then take the resulting m results and use the Chinese remainder theorem to construct the full multiple precision rational solutions at the end.  So, have solved the system exactly using only single precision integer arithmetic.  See<p>Morris Newman, ""Solving Equations Exactly,"" 'Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards -- B.

I think vimpulse gives the most essential bits of vim, while the other bits can be replaced with emacs functionality without a loss of efficiency. I don't miss any of my vim plugins. The only plugin I use that brings emacs closer to vim is viper/vimpulse. Vim still feels slightly (maybe 5-10%) slicker when editing text (I'm a long-time vimmer that moved to emacs a few months ago). In return you get (IMHO) superior indentation, better integration with external processes (such as debuggers and REPL sessions) and easier customization.<p>What exactly is it that you miss from vim that you're not getting in emacs? Is it only a generally decreased feeling of efficiency? Because that definitely went away for me once I learned to leverage and customize emacs.",1293234002

Not only will your public statements be more concrete but they'll be centralized so that it doesn't take HN to find them.<p>I have something to mention, too. We take our databases seriously. Our data <i>is</i> our service. I would feel very insecure about using a database backend that I did not fully understand (hosted or not). We choose our database engine based on the problems we are tackling. I'm able to read up on the actual internals of the databases we use. There are studies and research done on which one performs better in certain scenarios. I know exactly why I'd use one and not the other. I can physically download the database software, itself, and try it out. I can research the people that are making the database software and I can see that they're all very passionate about making a quality product. All of this comes together and allows me to choose the database engine that's right for my scenario, as well as makes me feel safe choosing the one that I do.<p>With that said, I have absolutely no clue what CloudDB <i>actually</i> is. Your site makes it sound like a service similar to MongoHQ. Or, is CloudDB an in-house database engine that you guys have written and it is also the name of your service in which the only option is to have you guys host it for me? How can I tell whether or not the actual database engine you guys use is any good? How can anyone be sure of this? Where is the science and statistics behind this? What philosophies do you guys follow? What was CloudDB's inspiration? What other databases is it similar to?<p>You claim that ""ClearDB makes your website, blog and app run faster by making it easier and less expensive for you to manage your data"" - how does that make my software actually run any faster? Your website is not very reassuring to me.

How can I save money using CloudDB? How can I be sure I'm not throwing my money away by trusting it?<p>So, what is CloudDB? What does it solve? Do you guys use MongoDB, MySQL, etc behind the scenes or is this your own database engine? For a database named ClearDB, I find it ironic that it's not very clear as to what that actually is. If you are in fact dedicated to making a good database, then I want to see it do well and I'd enjoy checking it out.

That depends on how often you leave your laptop unattended. :)<p>I, and pretty much every hacker I know, have <i>some</i> machine they can SSH to on the internet, <i>somewhere</i>. The only added risk is exposing your laptop to an attack against the SSH daemon, which involves either weak passwords, weak/unsecured keys, or an SSH server vulnerability. The first two are easily mitigated.

Imaging advances have obvious benefits outside of virtualization, and as long as five or six years ago you could send an image to Dell and they would slap it on however many computers you wanted to order. Virtualization has always seemed to be tantamount to this, a non sneaker-net way of doing the same thing. Nice, as far as it goes, but you save overhead (less and less every day, to be fair) by declining virtualization, and I think in the long run virtualization will be the province of large budgets and bad or subperformant code (which benefits from from the stop/start speed of images), and in classical terms introduces another single point of failure.",1293232905

I also am not one to keep more sshds running than I need to—but I guess the chances of this being exploited are slim. Are they as slim as having your laptop stolen, though?

For example, one of my applications allows people to upload files. They never access the file names themselves, but are allowed to input a ""file name."" This file name is all alphabetic and is checked for length restrictions and encoded in my own file naming system. The translations are maintained in the application database.

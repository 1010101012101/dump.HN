Other pathology occured though - since most of the tasks were group assignments (with the usual group being 2-3 people), it was common for a group to just divide the workload among its members across multiple courses, which in practice resulted in a possibility of getting a grade for course x on which one didn&#x27;t do any work (because he was busy doing group&#x27;s assignment for course y). The cool unintended consequence of this was that the whole studies were a multiyear training ground in team organisation and negotiations, which is arguably worth more in real life than some of the highly theoretical courses.",1371991996

These techniques are indeed very successful in practice and I hope that you will also enjoy these lectures. They make up a third of the class.

</code></pre>
are also provided in the additional material. The work mentioned in the introductory lectures include many applications that are based on mixed-integer programming. So I am not sure where this person is coming from with her/his comment.<p>This being said, constraint programming and local search are also very successful in practice, often for different types of problems. So this class aims at giving an introduction to a subset of the techniques that are successful in practice (there are other too) as an introduction to the field. My research group uses all three of these techniques to solve large-scale problems in logistics and supply-chains, energy, and disaster management. Some of the problems we solve require the three approaches together to achieve high-quality solutions. To paraphrase John von Neumann defending George Dantzig: &quot;If this technique applies to your problem, use it; otherwise do not&quot;.<p>We also cover column generation and large neighborhood search in the advanced topics. I used to cover Lagrangian relaxation in my class at Brown and we may add a lecture on this. This class has almost all the material of my optimization class at Brown University but not all, since it is a shorter. We may still add an advanced lecture on this topic (I have an additional motivation now)<p>With respect to the job market, I would simply say: Go to the Informs conference and see how many people, both from academia, industry, and government, are recruiting. Companies such Google, IBM, Amazon, ... have outstanding groups in optimization. Follow Mike Trick&#x27;s blog and tweeter accounts to get a sense of how lively this community is (see the community link on the page). I never had a student not find a job and most of them did not go to academia. One of them actually works for ... Fedex. My sense is that the opportunities for optimization keep growing and it is an exciting time for optimization. There are many startups, established companies, large multi-national organizations all doing optimization. Some focus on solvers, some on vertical products, some on dedicated applications, and some of several or all of these aspects. The field has progressed significantly.<p>There is a lot of work, and a lot of progress, in making optimization more reusable and the tools/solvers are now much better in being more generic. Unless P=NP, this will always be a challenge but there are more generic tools to solve classes of applications. There are also solvers that provide a lot more flexibility to build dedicated algorithms much more simply. Many people (including me) spent their research and academic careers trying to design such tools and some make a significant difference in practice.<p>Finally, optimization is a multi-disciplinary field. My group employs mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists. What I personally find incredibly stimulating in this area right now, is that sometimes you need a physicist, a mathematician, and a computer scientist together to solve a complex problem. We all look at a problem from different angles and there is tremendous values in that. I am part of the INFORMS, artificial intelligence, and computer science communities, and some of the scientific contributions I am most proud of are typically those when I was able to bridge two fields. Many of the techniques in optimization come from a variety of fields and this is also what makes it exciting.<p>And, yes, I am exciting about the future of optimization,<p>I hope it helps.&quot;",1371989313

These institutes offer courses on Java/.NET, SAP, Cognos, Oracle etc. They charge a ton, their trainers are no good and the students gain nothing from these. More recently, private engineering colleges are asking their students to base their final year projects on IEEE research papers. And there is now a large number of training institutes that offer readymade &quot;IEEE Projects&quot; to students for a cost.<p>I happen to know many such engineers who are lacking skills or grades or both. Some of these people happen to be distant relatives or family acquaintances. The problem isn&#x27;t just with the engineering colleges. Many such graduates lack understanding of basic sciences to have studied engineering in the first place (due to many factors including their own limitations, bad primary/secondary education etc). Few who manage to learn enough to be &quot;employable&quot; are stuck because there are no campus placements in their college. It is incredibly hard to find a job if there are no campus placements. Companies don&#x27;t have the resources to go to every such college when most of the graduates passing out are not employable.<p>I have been on the board of studies of two engineering colleges as an industry representative for past few years. There is a meeting every year to revise the course content but nothing useful comes out of it. In such meetings, I have strongly advocated that we introduce more hands on assignments/mini projects, ensure assignments/projects are not copied, lab exams are not based on a fixed set of publicly questions (students already know these questions). In one such meeting, suggestion was shot down with the excuse that if a mini-project is introduced, another set of institutes will come up to help students work around the system.

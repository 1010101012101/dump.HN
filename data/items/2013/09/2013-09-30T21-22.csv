I think eyeareque is correct.<p>In the days before the Internet, there were generally three ways to stay in touch with distant friends: writing letters, making telephone calls, or visiting in person.  All three required varying degrees of time and effort on ones part, but this was offset by the simple pleasure of conversing with a friend.  People didn&#x27;t bother engaging in this sort of activity with acquaintances or &quot;rather pleasant kinda-friends&quot;, because the personal <i>connection</i> didn&#x27;t exist.   There was no &quot;payoff&quot; significant enough to offset the effort.<p>The likes of Facebook remove most of this time and effort requirement.  You can &quot;friend&quot; people you haven&#x27;t spoken to in years or even decades with a minimum of difficulty.  While I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of cases where the lack of communication could be due to external causes (divorce, reassignment, death, job loss, etc) there are undoubtedly many more cases where people simply &quot;drifted apart&quot; because they found they didn&#x27;t have strong common interests.<p>Many Facebook (and similar social media) relationships really <i>aren&#x27;t</i> &quot;genuine&quot; (as eyeareque stated) for this reason.  Neither party really is interested in putting additional effort into the relationship beyond a simple &quot;like&quot; button click every now and then, if even that.<p>The OP&#x27;s story is sad, and while I agree with their summary that we should treasure our friends and family while we have them, let&#x27;s not pretend that the Golden Age of Social Media has somehow provided us with a revolutionary relationship tool.<p>Facebook is a dynamic, 21st Century version of the old &quot;phone number and address book&quot;: full of people to whom you might send a Christmas card, but little else.",1380578038

And, the next president (probably Hillary) will drive it even harder. 9/11 pushed the US past a point of no return. If you read some recent US military history you can get a well integrated picture of what&#x27;s really going on. The Office of the President essentially has it&#x27;s own military, separate from the US Armed Forces and the US Legislature - SOCOM. The President by his hand alone can order SOCOM, in secret, to strike at any time and even to assassinate American citizens. That&#x27;s an incredible power. It&#x27;s not the only way the Office of the President has become more powerful in the last decade, though. The number of &quot;signing statements&quot; used by Obama to bypass congress is mind blowing. The only way the power of the Office of the President will be reduced in the future, and things like the NSA domestic surveillance activities stopped, is through a civil war that ends in a new constitution and completely restructured government. Does anyone really think that members of congress aren&#x27;t being blackmailed with information the domestic surveillance activities produced? Look at the recent monitoring of press phones to see that the capabilities are turned against our representatives. Look to the recent insider trading investigation to see the kinds of things they&#x27;d be blackmailed over. They&#x27;re powerless.",1380577933

6472619,comment,6471535,6471535,1,0,jkaykin,,,"First, let me just tell you, you are not the only one. When I had my first panic attack, I got very scared and everything just hit me like a train. Anxiety, worry, strange pains and the worse, sleepless nights. I panicked about not being able to sleep and therefore I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep. I know exactly how you are feeling, after a few weeks of almost no sleep, I thought I had lost it and I was in too deep and that it would never end. Let me just assure you that this isn&#x27;t permanent and that you can change a lot but you have to put your mind to it.<p>Let me tell you what helped me: Questioning and Thinking, I will explain. Because of the panic/anxiety I had especially when I was laying in bed, trying to fall asleep, I also had a phobia of my bedroom and sleeping (this of course made it worse). I would lay in bed feeling miserable and not understand why my body wasn&#x27;t letting me rest and why this was happening to me. I would lay there scared and all I thought about was that it would never end and this was permanent. But with the help of counseling and just experiencing the symptoms enough, something in my thoughts changed and I started questioning: &quot;what&#x27;s the worst that can happen? This can&#x27;t kill me. If I don&#x27;t fall asleep, I may not feel great but nothing bad can really happen.&quot; And with that, I slowly started to get more and more comfortable and having better sleep. Some nights are better than others and when they aren&#x27;t great, it&#x27;s not permanent. Get your head out of thinking in patterns, if you can&#x27;t fall asleep, get up and read a book, get away from your bed, do something and tell yourself that you will fall asleep but if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not a big deal.<p>Although I did use medication, try to go the natural route first. And try distraction as well, as others have mentioned, there is some great meditation and other kinds of music you can listen to to help you sleep. Just Tell yourself that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you fall asleep or not. Understand that your body and mind know what to do and that they will do what is right. When you get the pains, once again, tell yourself that it may be uncomfortable but it is not permanent, it can&#x27;t kill you and it doesn&#x27;t have to keep you from sleeping.<p>Stay positive and remember that everything will be great. My email is in my profile and I would love to answer any more questions you have.",1380577776

   You&#x27;ll have a particularly hard time with asynchronous callbacks anyways.&quot;
</code></pre>
Couldn&#x27;t disagree more with this point. Wrap the function, not the call. Something like this:<p><pre><code>  function logExceptions( fn ) {
    return function() {
      try {
        return fn.apply( this, arguments );
      } catch( e ) {
        logException( e );

    };
  }

  myFunction = logExceptions( function() {
    // do stuff
  } );
</code></pre>
Now you just call myFunction() normally. Pretty painless.<p>Further, you only have to use a logger-wrapped function for your script&#x27;s entry points, not &quot;every function&quot;: the initialization method (if any), event handlers, setTimeout callbacks, etc. Since you&#x27;re probably already calling non-native methods which wrap those APIs, that method can handle exception log wrapping for you, too.<p>For example, for event handling I call an internal on(obj, &quot;name&quot;, function(){}) method, and on() passes the callback through logExceptions() for me.",1380577190

And, in some cases, there isn&#x27;t a 1-1 fallback between a canvas shape definition and an HTML element, e.g., an oval with inner radius.<p>However, we realize that in a lot of cases users just want elements that look like rectangles, and a DIV with certain styles will suffice.

If this counselor you are seeing doesn&#x27;t make you feel like he understands and wants to help you, then find someone who does. Even if they are giving the right advice, clearly you don&#x27;t feel comfortable with them or how they are communicating with you.

Ok, not the same house (usually), but the same neighborhoods over and over and over, week after week.<p>My neighborhood is considering hiring private security. The initial estimate is $15 a household per month given N neighbors sign up. I forget what N is, but it wasn&#x27;t that many. So yes, it would be a real monetary sacrifice to a lot of the residents around me, but the alternative, given that the police can&#x27;t really help right now, is to be at a very high risk of being burglarized with basically no chance of the perpetrators being caught.<p>Sometimes you have to take things into your own hands.

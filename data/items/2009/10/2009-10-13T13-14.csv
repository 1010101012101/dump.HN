The proposition moving money from one wallet to another is the ""you can get funded this way"" proposition. If that proposition is effectively fraudulent, the original blog posts sentiment is correct. Being able to opt out doesn't negate the claim that this is fraud.<p>BTW, I have also quoted and addressed the same sentence you accused me of skipping. I considered it and I was not convinced.<p>Founders are not paying for education. maybe you think they should. But they don't.

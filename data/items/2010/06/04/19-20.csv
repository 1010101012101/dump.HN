I'm a 23 year old entrepreneur and student at the University of Texas. I co-own http://anticlothes.com and have a few projects on the side for fun and personal growth. I also love helping/consulting with friends' businesses, so you're welcome to pick my brain for ideas or ask for some design help with your own projects. I'm not too picky with who I room with, but it is important to find someone with the same drive and determination; it makes for a great atmosphere.<p>I'm looking for a new roommate because my current roomie, and friend, is moving out to live on his own while he grows his company, GoodPop (http://goodpops.com). It's been a great year working with him on his company and watching it grow as big as it has, and I hope I help my next roommate in a similar fashion. I play a lot of soccer, work out daily, love good food and a nice glass of scotch, and am very laid back and accommodating.<p>The apartment is 15 stories up, with a great view of Town Lake from every room. It's a 1,425sq. ft unit with granite counter tops and carpeted bedrooms, with a balcony facing Town Lake. The building has a great gym and pool, is right off the jogging trail, and is walking distance to 6th street. Equally as important, it's just down the street from the convention center for SXSW. The building is right off of I-35, so you can get to nearly anywhere in Austin within 15-20 minutes. We negotiated the price down before moving in, so I'd hate to move out from here; a comparable apartment goes for $300 more per person. Rent is $930/mo., and I'll pay utilities.<p>Local Map: http://tinyurl.com/3a3nqcb<p>Floorplan: http://tinyurl.com/2wo38g3<p>Pictures: http://tinyurl.com/2vyg7cj<p>If you know anyone in Austin looking, send them my way! :) Feel free to ask any questions in this thread, or via email steven.kovar [at] gmail.com.",1275678875

It made it harder to sleep, i would almost get an upset stomach.<p>I could not figure out for the life of me why I was feeling that way, or how I could make it stop. It was completely new. The feeling have since passed and I hope it won't ever come back. But I have a bit more respect now for people who get stressed, it's not really helpful or useful to just tell them ""Don't be stressed and everything would be easier.""<p>And it's not really that easy to just.. get rid of the feeling.<p>The post is absolutely correct, stop ""being busy"" and you wouldn't be so busy.\nBut some real tips psychological or otherwise on how to avoid the feeling would be far more helpful than simply; in my opinion: stating the obvious.<p>""Stop being busy.

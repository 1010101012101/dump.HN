I learned from this book and thought it was very helpful.<p>For more modern stuff I really enjoyed ""Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"".  It will be most beneficial after reading through K&R and being familiar with ASM.  It focuses a lot on programming techniques, tips, and tricks so that compiled C/C++ code is turned into efficient assembly.<p>Finally, if you'd like to build a whole system end to end, the Motorola 68HC11 microcontroller is a fun little piece of hardware to play around with.  ""MC68HC11: An Introduction to Software and Hardware Interfacing"" is a good book for this purpose.<p>Best wishes on your journey into the low-level programming world!<p>PS. I'm biased.

Check out ""Computer Architecture and Design"" by Patterson & Hennesy.

It's an excellent bridge from Perl/Python to C; in particular, it gives you resizeable arrays and hash tables, which are the two things you will miss most from high level languages. My advice is, learn to code C for a couple months using CII, then tackle assembly. When you see how C programs are decomposed into functions, and how arguments are passed to functions, you'll understand much more about how assembly should work as well.<p>I've taught a couple people basic x86 assembly using a programmable assembler we wrote in Ruby.

Not <i>everything</i> he has to say is insightful. The art of a good writer is to extract the essence of an idea and express that in an elegant, entertaining, insightful and instructive fashion - not to brain-dump everything that comes through his head while he thinks of a topic.<p>And it doesn't help, when your article is that long, to have it printed in a light grey colour on white... it then becomes TL;CR - Too Long; Couldn't Read.",1230026017

Even though he was supervised by Bollobas (Erdos Number 1) he appears never to have co-authored with him, an unusual situation.  So it seems that my Erdos Number is smaller than his - perhaps I should offer to co-author a paper with him.  I'd get the kudos of co-authoring with a Fields Medal winner ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal</a> ) and he'd lower his Erdos Number to 3.",1230025838

407427,comment,407241,407315,0,0,mattobrien,,,"Because the ""cure"" threatens to kill the patient. The current recession is deflationary - something we have not seen in the US since the Great Depression. Whereas monetary policy can rather easily counteract a typical recession - and be used to bring a recession on as in 1982 to ""cure"" the economy of persistent inflation - in a deflationary environment monetary policy has little or no traction. And today, without fiscal stimulus, we could realistically find ourselves in a deflationary spiral. Businesses and assets that are otherwise sound can get pushed down in a vicious circle of deleveraging and shrinking demand resulting from lower prices and lower wages.<p>This has already begun. We've effectively seen a run on the shadow banking system of investment banks, prime brokers, hedge funds, etc., as initial losses in subprime have forced firesales of other assets to meet margin calls. To be sure, the credit bubble extended far beyond subprime, and the deteriorating economic fundamentals support continuing write-downs and losses on Alt-As, option ARMs, prime mortgages, auto loans, credit card debt, student loans, etc. But the credit market's subsequent freezing has put everyone at risk, so that the recession could potentially far overshoot the ""disease"" of over-indebtedness and overconsumption. Absent the government stepping in and trying to make use of the wasted capacity in the economy, making up for lost private and business investment, this process could spiral on well beyond what the economic fundamentals justify, and past anyone's ability to predict as well.<p>Yes, this recession is the result of previous bad choices, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to ameliorate the worst consequences and prevent a negative feedback loop. Telling people that this is the ""cure"" without trying to end the cycle of loss smacks of neo-Hooverism.",1230024982

Get started already! And don't wait for others to tell you which books to read!<p>2) That list is very suspect... I don't know how they compiled it, but it's a bit strange that it does contain some good books but then simultaneously allocates several positions to enjoyable but trashy books such as Harry Potter. Also gives several position to LotR (one is warranted, no more!), including one for the Silmarillion (wtf? I enjoyed it, but ""best book of the 20th century""? no way!) Memoirs of a Geisha is also nice but hardly a thought leader. And it seems to be completely missing immortal masterpieces such as Narziss & Goldmund (Herman Hesse), Joseph and his Brothers (Thomas Mann), The Trial (Kafka), and many others.<p>An ""OK"" starting point, but not even the shadow of a definitive list.",1230024707

407414,comment,407241,407388,0,0,walterk,,,"""The point of the spending isn't because infrastructure has a positive ROI its to artificially create jobs to cushion the people suffering from the current economic collapse.""<p>The reason why we're <i>spending</i> is to cushion ourselves from the economic collapse, yes. The reason why we're spending on <i>infrastructure</i> is because this is the only way to do it that isn't ultimately a waste, and we would have needed to do it at some point regardless of the state of the economy. No better time than an economic collapse to do so.<p>(This assumes that the infrastructure plans themselves are wise, of course. So far, they appear to be.)<p>Saying that investment in the US is traditionally ""repaid from increased borrowing"" has nothing to do with the rationality of spending on infrastructure (which eventually pays for itself by increasing GDP). A lack of responsible accounting and accountability causes US debt to be repaid with increased borrowing, not what the borrowed funds are spent on.",1230023268

9203212,comment,9199209,9201913,0,0,dogma1138,,,"Eh? The K-11/12 uses the same chassis as the Hubble.
Both of them have a 2.4M mirror, which means that under best conditions (minimal orbit) and no atmospheric distortion (which never happens) they&#x27;ll have a max resolution of 16 or so centimeters (that&#x27;s just basic optics for you), so not sure where did FAS got the 2cm number from. But i can tell you from 1st hand experience that even for military applications sub 50cm resolution is considered state of the art today.<p>US Spy satellites used to be always multi sensor platforms, the KH11/12 series was no different, and until the most recent ones they all had both digital and analog (film) components. 25 years ago the KH series digital sensor had a resolution of 400^2 pixel, maybe maybe in the mid 90&#x27;s they managed to get a bird with 800^2 sensor.<p>The resolution is also dependent on the spectrum you use, SWIR is the most common in use for military satellites as it gives the user a larger operational envelope in being able to take imagery in low light conditions as well as penetrating light cloud cover and some non-adverse weather conditions. 
However SWIR is just as much as affected by atmospheric distortions as visible light is, which means you tend to lose anywhere between 50% and 300% of your maximum resolution due to diffusion and refraction of the light within the atmosphere. (common back of the hand calculation is 2.5 times the maximum resolution of your optical system at MTF 50, which accidentally for the KH 2.4m mirror birds gives a resolution of about 40cm which slightly better than the best images released to the public from those platforms which was around the 50cm mark)
Thermal imaging tends to allow the sensor to capture much higher resolution image e.g. identifying individual people against a background (which is maybe where the 2cm resolution nonsense comes form) but those images are not graphically interpretable, they literally appear as white dots on a dark background.<p>SAR imagery probably gives the best resolution these days since it&#x27;s virtually not effected by any atmospheric conditions and there are tons of ways to cheat with it to give you even sub centimeter resolution it just will take weeks if not months to take that image. SAR however will not allow you to read a headline or a license plate since it uses RADAR interpolation to construct a visible image.<p>Visible spectrum sensors are pretty much not used in military applications outside of modern aerial photography, and even then they&#x27;ll always will have a SWIR or SAR fallback sensor. Simply because in a military application &quot;color&quot; isn&#x27;t as important as being able to take pictures in low light to pitch dark and in all weather conditions.<p>That said the development life cycle for military equipment is much much longer than it&#x27;s civilian counterparts, and in fact many earth observing civilian satellites tended to have better resolution than many if not all of their military (at least non-US ones) counterparts, many countries actually buy their satellite images from civilian companies EROS A and B (ImageSat) have about 80% foreign government utilization mostly European and APAC countries that lack the ability to launch their own birds, or have lacking coverage in general. So it would not surprise me if this bird has better capabilities than most current military sat&#x27;s out there, they don&#x27;t need to jump trough a billion hoops and standards, worry about compatibility with legacy and future platforms, or worry about congress cutting funding in the next mid term elections.<p>But damn 30cm per pixel in true color, thats better not only than most satellites out there, but than most high altitude atmospheric platforms as well.
Especially considering that no one besides the US has the capability to launch big birds these days, and even the US lost their ability to refuel them so not many 20,000 KG EOS&#x27;s are going up there. 
I&#x27;m really wondering what optics they use since I don&#x27;t think they use a mirror which comes even close to the 2.4M the NRO was able to use. They must to have build a pretty insane adaptive optics setup to get that resolution going.",1426351843

Apart from the stigmatization of addiction as an intrinsically bad thing, where&#x27;s the harm? Outside of legal and financial issues, which society has self-inflicted? Where&#x27;s the evidence that users derive no more value once addicted? Users can &quot; stay well &quot; with less euphoric opiates, yet choose not to. If all they&#x27;re taking the drug for is to clear the pain of withdrawal, why not prefer simpler, longer-lasting opiates?<p>People are treated with terrible shit like Haldol, lithium, and Zoloft, but we don&#x27;t mock those users, calling the medication a toxic addiction and an escape. Even when those medications are very damaging to the body (lithium requiring regular checkups to make sure it hasn&#x27;t actually accumulated to toxic levels).

Really?<p>&quot;[TumblrInAction], a subreddit dedicated to mocking Tumblr – where marginalized groups, particularly LGBTQ, post about their experiences&quot;<p>Here they neatly imply r/TumblrInAction mocks LGBTQ issues when in fact, it mocks people who use identities as tools to divide and hit people over the head with. Which is incidentally what this report does:<p>&quot;Overt bigotry: the use of bigoted (racist/sexist/homophobic etc.) language, whether targeting any particular individual or more generally, which would make members of the referenced group feel highly uncomfortable&quot;
In other words: assuming everyone in group X feels the same way about what the authors consider offensive language. This ignores e.g. the vast amount of gay people on chan boards who say &quot;faggot&quot; for fun to each other.<p>This so-called bigotry is contrasted with &quot;supportiveness&quot;, apparently a desirable trait. Yet you can easily find people&#x27;s horrible behavior being supported in more hugbox-style forums, when they get into an in/out-group fight and all the niceties go out the window for the sake of victimhood. We saw this with Atheism+, with r/GamerGhazi, and the &quot;women in tech&quot; activists.<p>Speaking of, notice how they explicitly contrast r/TheRedPill with a companion &quot;Women in Tech&quot; link in the footnote/popup for no stated reason. TheRedPill is supposedly &quot;dedicated to male chauvinism&quot;, where &quot;bigoted comments received approval&quot;. Well, if you define the entire subreddit&#x27;s subject matter as bigoted, are you surprised the community appears to support bigotry by your own count? I have read TheRedPill, it is the male equivalent of Jezebel, nothing more, nothing less.<p>Really, this is just spreading fear about certain reddits, as the summary practically admits: which communities you should avoid, according to data. Yet the most toxic subreddit of all by their own data, ShitRedditSays, is nicely euphemized as home to &quot;unproductive conversations&quot;.

However, I think there is something to be said for the fact that, by virtue of being the ratio of C/R, there are exactly tau radians in a circle. This really does simplify the math, and gives more meaning to the constants on tau vs. pi.<p>There&#x27;s more meaning from &#x27;3 * tau / 4&#x27; vs. &#x27;3 * pi / 2&#x27; because the constant tells you that you have exactly &#x27;3 / 4&#x27; of a circle. With pi, this is less obvious because there are &#x27;2 * pi&#x27; radians in a circle, but the 2 frequently disappears (like in my example), which leaves you with &#x27;3 / 2 of a <i>half a circle</i>&#x27;, which isn&#x27;t obvious how much that actually is. pi definitely <i>does</i> have it&#x27;s uses when you&#x27;re talking about the diameter, but when you&#x27;re talking about something like <i>rad</i>ians, it makes more sense to use the ratio of circumference to <i>radius</i> rather then circumference to diameter.

258876,comment,257917,258550,0,0,silencio,,,"With problem 1, wouldn't the old edition still be cheaper than the new? Or would the publisher just stop publishing the older edition? Even with new editions I've come across situations where the bookstore was having an impossible time ordering enough to meet demand.<p>And the second...I just guess I don't understand <i>why</i> new editions have to be adopted so quickly sometimes. I taught myself all sorts of subjects out of used books I got at garage and library sales. Years later actually taking the classes with a brand new edition of a text, nothing's changed. Only the price..used books would be dirt cheap and the new edition would be $120. So the department assigns a book, why do they have to assign it? Kickbacks from the publisher? My question above about the publisher discontinuing the older edition?<p>I guess I'm ultimately mad about this whole situation (and yes, I was a textbook torrents user although they never had the texts for my classes). I even had one class at a CC (I think it was anatomy) where the class itself was only somewhere around $70 but the materials and mainly the text|online access|workbook were in the $300 range. I about flipped out then.",1217230951

258873,comment,258638,258810,0,0,snprbob86,,,"So it looks like Google grabbed about 40 links before giving up? I wonder what a good ""score"" is? At first, I'd guess less is better, but too few might be running the risk of throwing out potentially good pages. Too many, and the bot is just wasting effort. The 40 score could vary as well based on parallel conditions assuming many bot instances are sharing a task pool. Be sure to post the Microsoft results if/when they crawl you.",1217230496

258866,comment,257588,257588,0,0,ayin,,,"This PISA test is ridiculous as a standard to measure the general intelligence. 400,000 is not a very big sample size in certain countries. It seems that this method measures more of the homogeneity of the education level of a country rather than the smartness of its students.<p>I'm curious about the sampling method of this test, it's really hard to select a representative sample among diversity such as U.S.<p>That being said, I do agree with the way a lot of classes are taught in American public schools. Especially the projects where students ""glue things on a poster for an hour"", mindless things like that really waste time and energy better used in something else.<p>And I cant help but think that Finnish kids really dont have much to do compared to people at other countries? They might as well do really well in their studies!",1217229654

Lycos, Alta-Vista (the original search engine), pets.com, over half of those companies had a good idea...<p>Friendster, 'billions' of page-views... per month?<p>I think I'm missing 1% of what your saying... I wouldn't switch places with them, I'm not where they are yet... I'm in the development stage, alpha-stage.<p>Above all that, these companies are on multiple sites listed multiple times for being 'part of the economic dot com failure'.  Is that what your referring too when you say ""created machines that were too large for the revenues to support""?",1217229278

It's all backed by replicated PostgreSQL and Oracle instances for persistence.<p>We do service monitoring and control via monit, deploy via Capistrano, and run a custom source-built Ruby distribution from a network share mounted on each of the app server boxes.<p>I'm watching mod_rails/Passenger with interest, and once it seems to have stabilized a bit, will probably try it out for at least some of our apps.",1217228997

258856,comment,258609,258820,0,0,parker,,,"Sorry dude, but you must not remember them vividly, because the majority of these sites did actually have a user base and did actually make revenue.  In some cases (WebVan for instance), they actually made quite a bit of revenue.<p>They were simply prey to illogical economics.  They had all created machines that were too large for the revenues to support.<p>As for Friendster, I know it's been fun to say that they've failed for the last 3 years, but as far as I can tell their story isn't even close to being over.  They have billions of pageviews and a growing userbase.  I'm guessing you'd probably switch places with them right now.",1217228838
258855,comment,258505,258835,0,0,rcoder,,,"It's not about them seeing the ""commercial advantage"" in free market terms; it's about mandating a particular approach (in this case, open hardware and software from top to bottom) because it's the only way to insure that the basic infrastructure used in elections <i>works</i>. This is not a case where the whims of the market should decide the approach taken.<p>If no one gets rich on the design and implementation of electronic voting systems, that's <i>fine</i>. I'd rather see it run by well-intentioned, poorly-paid academics within a strict peer-review model than by unknown private entities.",1217228597

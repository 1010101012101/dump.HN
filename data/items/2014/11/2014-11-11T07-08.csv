I lived in an anarchist separatist vegan collective in my time in germany (long story), with the result of me not eating any animal products for over a year. The first time (after 11 months) that I ate meat after that (a steak. bleu) I puked my guts out and had the runs for over a week.<p>It took about a month of slowly introducing meat before I was back to normal. There are others that made the switch cold turkey without problems though.",1415692758

We have sometimes toyed with implementing a lightweight guidelines reminder to indicate (privately, to the commenter) when a comment is breaking one of the guidelines. I&#x27;d still like to experiment with this someday.<p>Ideally, it would be a community thing and not a moderator thing. The spirit would be, let&#x27;s all remind each other of the guidelines when we need to. The things that HN cares about, like civility and signal/noise ratio, don&#x27;t come naturally to an internet forum. We all have to work at it (definitely including me).<p>Features like that are hard to get right, though, and until there&#x27;s a good idea of how to do it that fits naturally into the existing site, it will remain prospective.

The script in this scenario would be able to read files it knew the path of but not browse the drive properly.  Without randomization, it would be a safe bet to try things like %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Mozilla\Firefox\Profile\Cookies and be able to pull your cookies for examination.  If you can&#x27;t get the USERPROFILE environment variable, the script could also do C:\Users\Admin\... and replace Admin with common names as well like John, Sue, etc.  It also helps make it harder for malware to find.  Not much harder, mind you, but it does require specific code to look for the Firefox profile as opposed to a single check.",1415692710

Maybe there would be a scheme where you could use these Option types as regular values.  The moment you try to use one of them that is actually an error (trying to pass it as an argument to another function without inspecting it first for example), it causes your current function to return an error.<p>Or something like that.  Maybe that&#x27;s a language design change that isn&#x27;t going to be worked out in a social media post.<p><i>The &quot;defer&quot; mechanism is clunky.</i><p>I like defer.  Open a file?  Defer close it right afterwards in the code.  Bam, done!  That&#x27;s nice, and works even if there was a panic deeper in the call stack somewhere.<p>The idiomatic way to do that in Go, however, can mask errors, like say if Close() returned an error, you might not see it if you just did a &#x27;defer foobar.Close()&#x27;  Those errors should go somewhere... somehow.",1415692692

8588792,comment,8579608,8586722,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">But people who brandish the &quot;evidence based&quot; argument do not mean that. What they mean is that if X does not behave in a particular way for which it is feasible to design an experiment, then X ought not to exist.<p>No.  It means that if X does not behave in such a way that it is <i>physically possible</i> to design an experiment, X <i>most probably</i> is not a sensible concept for anything other than &quot;the idea of X&quot;.<p>The problem here is that subjective experiences are highly malleable and have never particularly corresponded <i>directly</i> to objective reality without further interpretation.  So your subjective experiences are explainable in three possible ways:<p>* You subjectively experienced something we don&#x27;t have a theory for yet, but which is part of physical reality.  We will eventually figure out how to test it and construct a theory of it.  This is very unlikely.<p>* You subjectively experienced something whose underlying causal basis is so highly complex that the interaction may not be repeatable (ie: whatever you interacted with could be capable of <i>choosing</i> with whom to interact or not, and when).  This is <i>extremely</i> unlikely.<p>* You had a subjective experience that does not correspond to any external reality.  This is quite common, actually, and the most probable option.",1415692660

Prison can suck without forcing people to eat and live against their moral values. Do we really thing rehabilitation works better when we show no respect?<p>I am a meat eater, but this whole discussion is laughable in many ways. I think veganism is a healthy conviction. Stepping on that is likely to just make people more angry and feel more alienated by the system.<p>A bit unrelated: Back in the days when I had no money at all I lived on rice, pasta, beans, broccoli, cabbage and an occasional glass of milk for 3 months (meat is expensive, at least when your budget is about 1 euro a day) without getting any notable deficiencies (went to see a doctor when I got money).

I don&#x27;t know if they changed or I did, but what I see of modern Libertarianism seems to me to be a fundamentalist, reptilian form of what I learned about back then.<p>If I have to choose between freedom from food-borne illness and the freedom of kitchen workers not to wash after they wipe, it seems like an easy choice to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nolan.jimeyer.org/nolan_example.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nolan.jimeyer.org/nolan_example.php</a>",1415692128

This has meant that the Rust team has needed to do a huge amount of experimentation and iteration, culminating in the tight set of core semantics that you see in the language today. It&#x27;s not been an easy journey for the them, but a great deal has been learned in the process, and even if Rust never &#x27;makes it&#x27; into widespread usage, its contributions to the field of programming language design will be felt for years to come.<p>This is not to diminish the efforts of the Go team - they have produced a really tight, polished language, with an excellent set of bundled libraries.

Developers could work on feature branches, but we had no way of deploying these branches to a test environment. The develop branch usually wasn&#x27;t in a state where we could safely cut releases from it, in effect every release a was train release.

Yes. Running it - no!<p>These tools make sense at the scale of a single project with two hosts in my opinion. Here&#x27;s what happens in my experience when developer with little ops experience takes care of a few VMs with small apps: (so a majority of services out there)<p>- where are the logs and what&#x27;s the available space for them? depends on which VM, some don&#x27;t log at all, some log debug because they had some work done weeks ago<p>- which hosts are running which app version and what&#x27;s the upgrade procedure? likely every one has different manual steps<p>- what&#x27;s your system/libraries/application upgrade story? likely missing / different for each host<p>- what&#x27;s your DR story? likely missing<p>- what&#x27;s the state of monitoring and are all hosts covered to the same extent? unlikely<p>- is the development and test environment at all similar to production? unlikely<p>For each of those items you&#x27;re likely to go back and introduce something that docker/puppet would&#x27;ve either made easier or provided from the beginning. Knowing that you can consistently build the same host/app every time and that it&#x27;s got the same options, utilities, tools, etc. available is a huge gain even on 2 VMs.<p>Yes, the huge benefits start at 1X hosts, but I&#x27;ve seen the benefits and I&#x27;m never deploying even one production machine without automation anymore. (salt in my case though) Not doing so is actually more work in a long run. And as soon as you deployed one app that way, you have your library of scripts - another app will likely look very similar and anything around it (monitoring, logging, backups, database deployments, ...) will likely be exactly the same.<p>So I think that you either pay that 10k for orchestration from the start, or you end up paying it bit by bit, every time something needs to be added or goes wrong.",1415691081

The Culture is a post-scarcity society; while you can&#x27;t have a planet full of minions and go about conquering other people, nobody in the Culture really lacks for material needs of any kind and risk is virtually non-existent, unless you are determined to off the grid and get yourself killed somewhere that won&#x27;t be noticed and without having your mind-state backed up. In the absence of economic scarcity and risk, of course money becomes meaningless. I&#x27;m not sure about the absence of private property; people certainly have their own houses, ships and other things. Both libertarianism and communism become sort of meaningless in the absence of economic scarcity, and hardly anyone in the Culture seems to be a hippy either - on the contrary, they&#x27;re all enjoying the hell out of everything technology has to offer, unless he means their energetic epicureanism. Nobody in the Culture (outside of Contact/Special Circumstances, the secret agent set of People Who Have Adventures) is asked to make personal or economic sacrifices of any meaningful kind. It&#x27;s easy to be generous from a starting point of endless abundance.<p>Some of Banks&#x27; most memorable Culture novel characters go against this trend; Jennat Gurgeh in <i>The Player of Games</i> is singular precisely because of his egoism and selfishness, and this is assigned <i>huge</i> economic value in the story, notwithstanding the nose-holding that accompanies it; Bora Horza Gorbuchul in <i>Consider Phlebas</i> is fundamentally opposed to the Culture but is invested with immense moral standing despite his persistent anti-heroism. I think that a lot of the time Banks likes to start with the Culture as the default narrative perspective and then inflict a hypersadistic external antagonist, beside whom the hedonism and self-absorption of the Culture folk seems positively benign, even though it might appear neurotic or narcissistic by contemporary standards. The Culture-Idiran war (which is in many ways the defining event of the civilization) is laid out in some depth in the latter book, and examines the Culture&#x27;s transformation from a reactive to a proactive culture, or a transition from pacifism to <i>realpolitik</i>, if you like. It&#x27;s interesting to me that while life <i>within</i> the Culture is largely based on non-economic mutualism, the vast majority of Banks&#x27; Culture protagonists are plucked form the moral gray area in which Special Cricumstances proactively attempts to shape events to suit the Culture - a gray area Banks liked so much that he named one of the Minds after it in <i>Excession</i>.",1415690067

The people that have the most to gain are the least likely to look into stuff like this.<p>The Moneyball revolution in sports has taken over front offices, scouting departments, and stats geeks. But not the holiest of holies, the world of player development. Keeping a player on the court for a few extra minutes per game could result in a huge gain for the team. Keeping Lebron James or Troy Tulowitzki healthy could literally be worth $20 million or more to the team. Yet they pay nothing on that side of the game and do not look for new avenues or approaches.<p>It is insanity. But it is also professional sports, so, it is what it is. Eventually, there will be a revolution. I only hope it&#x27;s within the next 20 years.",1415689449

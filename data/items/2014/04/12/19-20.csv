Not people who come from other places where the conventions are different, but people who have lived here their whole lives.<p>I&#x27;m not surprised (and empathize with) people who are reacting to the inefficiency of The System (&quot;why don&#x27;t restaurants just charge more and pay their employees reasonable wages?&quot;). This is correct, but as others have pointed out, in the US at least we seem to be stuck at a suboptimal local maximum in this area. It would be impractical (and maybe catastrophic) for any one restaurant to suddenly adopt this policy, so that&#x27;s not going to happen anytime soon.<p>Rather, I&#x27;m always amazed at the portion of people who have a visceral reaction to tipping due to what appears to be just plain lack of empathy. These aren&#x27;t the people who are saying, &quot;why doesn&#x27;t the restaurant just pay better?&quot;. That totally makes sense. These aren&#x27;t the people who tip less (or not at all) when they&#x27;ve had a really bad experience with the server. That makes sense too.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m talking about the people who deep down inside just always have a reflexively negative reaction to directly giving their money to the person who just served them. These are the people who feel happy about themselves when they say things like, &quot;my tips start at 0% and go up from there&quot;, or who seem to put way, way, way too much mental energy into grading the level of service that they&#x27;ve received and coming up with a number that reflects that level of service each and every time they go to a restaurant. If anyone posting is that kind of person, please just shut up and start being a better person already. I encounter these people all the time in SV. These aren&#x27;t poor people for whom the tip is ever a meaningful amount of cash. These are people making many times the annual income of their servers, getting continually worked up over a few dollars, supposedly because of &quot;the principle of the thing&quot;. These are always people who have never worked in a restaurant, and are almost always people who never even had a job until after they got out of college. If anyone posting here is posting for this reason, please just get over it and find more constructive things to get worked up over. Ideally something that doesn&#x27;t directly impact the income of people making way the hell less money than they do.",1397332607

The service was so bad it actually reversed my opinions against tipping. The servers clearly didn&#x27;t care much about making us happy, messing up almost every aspect of the order. They put meat in my food - I&#x27;m vegetarian. My father got his food 20 minutes after my mother and I did. The waiter forgot one of my drinks. We called over the manager who offered us a free dessert to make up for it. Guess what? The dessert was on the bill. I&#x27;m always happy to tip 20+% for good service, but being forced (yes, we asked) to pay the service charge added insult to injury. This is just one data point, but the Linkery was infamous around San Diego for having much worse service than other places in a similar price range.

7578917,comment,7578651,7578785,3,0,w0utert,,,"Thanks for that, you basically described exactly how I feel about tipping in the US. I&#x27;m from Europe myself, and where I live, a tip really is a way to explicitly express appreciation of service, instead of some kind of unwritten rule you have to tip &#x27;10% for mediocre service&#x27;, &#x27;15% for satisfactory service&#x27; and &#x27;above 15% for outstanding service&#x27;. No tip here, basically means &#x27;satisfactory&#x27;, anything more is considered a reward for great service and I don&#x27;t mind tipping big at all when the service is good.<p>I travel to the US every now and then, and recently had a heated discussion about tipping with my (also European) colleague, who insisted on tipping at least 15% even though there was nothing special about the service we received. The premise was that this was considered &#x27;normal&#x27; in the US, that we had to &#x27;conform to this culture of tipping&#x27;, and that it would be considered rude to tip less, say 10%. I vehemently oppose this kind of reasoning, because in my opinion, a tip should reflect appreciation. I&#x27;m not opposed to tipping when I&#x27;m somewhere where waiters are underpaid and depend on decent tips, but I reject the idea I have to follow some kind of &#x27;table&#x27; that says the minimum tip is 10%, even if I get served a raw steak. I&#x27;d much rather tip a lot less (say 5 to 10%) for mediocre service, and a lot more (say 20 to 25%) for outstanding service, but apparently, this is &#x27;rude&#x27; and &#x27;inconsiderate&#x27; according to my collegue.<p>The fact that the tip needs to be a percentage of the check doesn&#x27;t make sense to me anyway. If I order an expensive bottle of wine, the tip would have to increase much more compared to when I order a cheap wine. That doesn&#x27;t make sense at all, it&#x27;s completely unrelated to the performance of the waiter.",1397331899

I tip flight attendants anywhere they still take cash.  And a surprising number of occupations are happy to accept tips if you try.  Tips don&#x27;t have to be monetary, they can be free tickets to a show or food or a vice (i.e. cigarettes or alcohol).  Doctors don&#x27;t get tips because of the high pay of their job, but many industries have bonuses provided by the buyer in exchange for a job performed beyond expectations.<p>5b) [Workers practice tip-sharing] according to a culture called “tipout.” But as this is not obligatory, it is inefficient and can foster cheating, resentment, or worse.<p>False, and this clearly shows the writer does not have service industry experience.  Anywhere tipout is practiced, it is required as a percentage minimum of sales.  However, often workers &quot;tipout&quot; above and beyond the required percentage, to anyone and everyone who earned it.  In many service jobs your co-workers are like family and you all take care of one another.<p>Priceonomics usually writes great articles, but this one should be taken with a grain of salt.",1397330621

Perhaps I should have said intelligent <i>behavior</i>, rather than intelligent structures, is self-organized.<p>But, I don&#x27;t think <i>any</i> approach to consciousness can be considered a large arm of cognitive science. Most cognitive scientists don&#x27;t want to touch consciousness with a ten-foot pole. But of course you&#x27;re right that connectionism lives on.<p>Let me try to explain the kind of self-organization I have in mind. Consider the fundamental question &quot;how is behavior organized&quot;? The behaviorists pointed to organization in the environment. Cognitivists point to organization of internal representations. Connectionists and similar approaches point to organization of neural structures. Yes, something intelligent emerges from simple, perhaps self-organized, components in this scheme. But they are unwilling to take self-organization to the level of behavior.<p>In my opinion, a true self-organizational approach to behavior is to say that behavior emerges from the interaction between organism and environment. This is the level at which we need to accept self-organization. It is far from the mainstream. The mainstream approach to vision, for example, starts with the retinal image and asks what can be inferred from it. Yes, maybe they say that this inference engine is itself a self-organized structure. But it still reifies an input-process-output view of cognition. The sensory system receives input, constructs a model of the world. The &quot;higher cognitive&quot; centers formulate plans from this model. The action system instantiates these plans.<p>To bring it back to the ants: The ants demonstrate what can be done without explicit planning. Modern cognitive science studies explicit planning, even if they agree that this capability emerges from simple components.<p>As I said in the other post, I could provide literature if you are interested in any of these specific debates.",1397329847

Thus, a state might preempt federal authority by first       \n  prosecuting and providing for a lenient sentence (as compared to the possible \n  federal sentence) or acquitting defendants who had the sympathy of state      \n  authorities as against federal law enforcement.[56]                           \n\n  55 Benton v.

7578785,comment,7578651,7578651,9,0,Jugurtha,,,"Before I even read the articles, here&#x27;s how it goes:<p>- Where I live, there isn&#x27;t a culture of tips. Employees are paid by employers.<p>- Some employees though, and businesses, delight me. Like I &quot;really&quot; enjoy it there. So I tip.<p>Look at what happened here: I tip in an environment not used to tips <i>at all</i>.<p>Tips should be a consequence for delight. Not some thing you do. It&#x27;s just that I can&#x27;t help tip people who take care of me (and I&#x27;m from that culture). Sometimes, they&#x27;ll offer a discount and I&#x27;ll insist on paying the full price.<p>It happens I enter a shop only looking for directions to somewhere, and the person there goes beyond it. I buy something. It&#x27;s natural for me.<p>Now, the very thought of <i>having</i> to tip, as if it is a given, granted thing I <i>have</i> to do, whether the waiter/waitress was good or bad would make me sick.<p>I understand they are under pressure, but I have seen waiters/waitresses under pressure behave with an unimaginable class and composure. With whom things that would piss you off would magically disappear. They exist, you should hire them. Not some snorky bitch waiter/waitress(yeah, there are waiters who are bitches. It&#x27;s not just waitresses) who&#x27;ll treat you like crap, and then have the gall to even <i>expect</i> a tip (I mean, you screw up, you go incognito and pray you even get to keep your job, not ask for a tip and have an attitude).<p>So I say this:<p>- Their revenues are mainly from tips and they are not very well paid: It&#x27;s not the customer&#x27;s problem what your employer does. But <i>you</i> can delight a patron, and most people who are delighted pay beyond reason for service beyond &quot;normal&quot;.<p>- If you&#x27;re a waiter and think this is unfair, look around you. I am sure there are other waiters who get tipped regularly and fatly. What are they doing you&#x27;re not ?<p>Humans are generally not assholes. If a patron gets treated really well, only a small percentage will be assholes.<p>I help my friend with his business (car accessories, installing alarm systems, etc) and people just don&#x27;t believe the length we go to. They just are shocked. They&#x27;ve never seen that. The welcoming, the explanations, the garantees, etc.<p>I have a friend who sells computers and repairs them (and some other stuff like flash drives, etc). People would drive 30 miles to buy a flash drive from <i>him</i>. They could buy it anywhere, but they buy it from <i>him</i>. People came to him from 400 miles away, because of reputation and service and referrals (his regular clients vary from normal dude, to senators).<p>Your behavior matters.<p>I once called customer service of my crappy ISP, as usual, and that day, a tremendous guy answered the phone. This is something I have never seen before. I was literally in frigging bro love with him. I mean, I asked him if there is any way I could like give feedback to his supervisor or something. He treated it with grace saying he was flattered, and he was only doing his job. And no, he wasn&#x27;t just doing his job: He went the extra 100 miles.<p>I&#x27;ve eaten in many places. Some places I wouldn&#x27;t let them keep a 5 cents change because they were cunts. Some places I&#x27;d have no problem leaving 30% to even 50% at times because they were simply surreal and treat people like royalty.. Like really, really, really cater to you.

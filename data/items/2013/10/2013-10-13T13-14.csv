There seemed to be some vague resentment at the pop-business-marketing-solution-in-a-book industry and some desire to link it back to the professional middle class<p>To me the argument should run differently:<p>- technical innovation has never been higher, both in absolute terms and in the products being brought to market.<p>- yes many innovations are tiny evolutions on existing products, but blame consumer surplus capture rather than a conspiracy.<p>- If we want more forward leaps in science and technology we should lobby our governments to double the STEM spending at least.  It&#x27;s hard to bring a product to market if it&#x27;s core has not been invented.<p>- And really, TED talks, and all the other pop-insight industry, is not lying - they may be repeating some basic ideas (learn how to solve a problem, use that method in a new area, monitor the results) and we should not get upset if people try to hype up their life&#x27;s work.  No just accept that there are 7 billion people, and we need that many to see the next ground shaking concept invented in time.<p>One other point - I suspect the reason the author is hearing the same points raised time and again is a sign of an a creation of agreement over the accepted new paradigm for society to use.  once upon a time slavery was an acceptable paradigm, so was anti-gay prejudice and so was religion and superstition.<p>What we see is the new modes of thought getting tried out like clothes in a shop.

The primes have fascinated generations of mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike, yet their properties remain deeply mysterious.

And I only use two computers: one at home, one at work. Installing a preconfigured keyboard layout on a new machine takes a minute.<p>I mainly returned to QWERTY (I&#x27;m repeating myself again, but so be it) because English isn&#x27;t my native language. All these alternative keyboard layouts are optimized for English. I use a QWERTZ mutation (PN-87 - rare and somewhat forgotten even in Poland) for typing in Polish.

That is the reason the tax code is hard.  It's also a small reason(1) wealthy people can manipulate the tax code to their advantage.  I don't think it has anything to do with a graduated rate.  Granted, a flat tax would allow employers to pay the tax and employees wouldn't have to file taxes, but if there were no loopholes in our current graduated tax system, the government could provide an online form that could have you fill out your taxes in < 5 minutes.<p>(1) I said a small way because if we really want to get the super wealthy to pay more in taxes, a big way could change things is by making capital gains count as income.  This is the reason someone like warren buffet pays 17% of his 46 million income, because it's all capital gains taxed at 15% (<a href=""http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/tax/article1996735.ece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/tax/article1996735.ec...</a>).

1180364,comment,1180308,1180308,0,0,lpolovets,,,"I think the claimed point is valid. If you are a good programmer, you can improve your chances of finding a job much more by polishing up your resume, writing awesome cover letters, networking, etc. than you can by learning new programming languages.<p>It's all about bang for the buck. If you spend 100 hours learning, your programming skills and hence your ability to find a job might improve by a few percent; if you spend 100 hours on marketing yourself better, your programming skills stay the same but your chances of finding a job will improve greatly. It's like a lot of software... once the internals are good enough, it's much better to make the UI good than to keep the UI crappy while making the back end a little better.<p>Also, anecdotally, every good company that I've interviewed with has said that if I am the right person for the job, then they will give me the benefit of the doubt that I can pick up whatever technologies are necessary.",1268203658

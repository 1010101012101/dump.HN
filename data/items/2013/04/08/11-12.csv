5511147,comment,5508977,5509717,1,0,spin,,,"""Myres Briggs was not based on science, but Jungian pseudo-science. It's since morphed from an interesting theory (which happened to be mostly incorrect) to a pop-culture superstition.""<p>Just because something starts from intuition, does not make it non-science.  (Although, I suppose that's usually the case... there's plenty of pseudo-science to go around.)  I've heard that Maxwell was motivated by ""elegance"" when he came up with Maxwell's equations.<p>The question is:  does it stand the test of scientific rigor?<p>You said that Jung's theory ""happened to be mostly incorrect"".  Do you have links to research on this?  I am genuinely curious.<p>I think that the Myers-Briggs temperament sorter can and should be subjected to scientific scrutiny.<p>Let me propose a hypothetical personality test:  ""Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke?""  From here, we can do simple statistical correlations.  Suppose we dug a little deeper and discovered that:  62% of the people who prefer Coke prefer going to movies over sports games on Friday night.  71% of the people who prefer Pepsi prefer going to sports games over going to the movies on Saturdays.  (This is a hypothetical example that I just invented in my head.)<p>There might be a deeper reason for this...  Coke advertises at movie theaters like crazy, and Pepsi advertises at sporting events like crazy.  Or whatever.<p>So... if you are oblivious to the underlying science of the questionnaire, and if you answer honestly, then I can use basic statistics to guess something about your personality, at above chance levels.<p>(BTW, these are just preferences.  Just because you prefer Pepsi doesn't mean that you don't occasionally enjoy a Coke, etc.)<p>Likewise, there could be a study of the Myers-Briggs temperament sorter.  (For those who don't know, the Myers-Briggs temperament sorter has four dimensions:  Extrovert-vs-Introvert, iNtuitive-vs-Sensing, Feeling-vs-Thinking, Perceptive-vs-Judging.)  We can do plain-old statistical correlations between people's answers on the test and their life choices.  Are ""SJ""s more likely to become police officers or school teachers?  Are ""NT""s more likely to become programmers or scientists?  (And/or, if they don't become those things, do they wish that they did?)<p>It's a straight-forward question to put this onto rigorous scientific grounding.  I'm curious if this has been done yet... (you said that it ""happened to be mostly incorrect""...  do you have links to research papers?)",1365422295

My wife is incredibly talented, well organized and highly knowledgeable as it relates to human well being and health. She has a biology degree and a masters of health science. She is also a certified personal trainer and an educator of 6 years.<p>I've been wondering if many startups have any sort of employee well being programs in place and if this is possibly something she could do remotely with occasional travel. My thoughts are that startups would benefit greatly from having someone that could help employees make good health choices and encourage them through incentive plans, programs and awareness campaigns. Considering the long hours at the office/computer chair I know first hand that it is easy to fall into a sedentary lifestyle when focusing so hard on work. A healthy team is ultimately going to be a much more effective, efficient and happy team.<p>Any thoughts or suggestions for how my wife could get into something like this would be greatly appreciated.

(<a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf</a>)<p>In 2012 they noted that:<p>If we sum up the amounts accumulated at the 609,270 addresses which only receive and never send any BTCs [bitcoins], we see that they contain 7,019,100 BTCs, which are almost 78% of all existing BTCs. Due to the way bitcoins can be repeatedly moved to fresh addresses, some of which can be very recent, we can not claim that all these bitcoins are out of circulation. However,76.5% of these 78% (i.e., 59.7% of all the coins in the system) are old coins"", de\nned as bitcoins received at some address more than three months before the cut off date (May 13th 2012), which were not followed by any outgoing transac-\ntions from that address after they were received. One can also argue that very old dormant bitcoins were simply abandoned or lost by users who experimented with the system in its early days, when it was very dicult to buy anything or to exchange bitcoins into dollars. To be even more cautious with our estimation of dormant bitcoins, we decided to ignore all the transactions which took place prior to July 18th 2010, when Mt.Gox started its exchange and price quoting services. The sum of the balances of all the addresses which have not been\nactive since that date is 1,657,480 bitcoins. Clearly, by considering all these bitcoins as ""lost"" rather than ""hoarded"" we are underestimating the number of bitcoins which are kept dormant in ""saving accounts"". By ignoring these very old bitcoins and repeating the same calculation, we found that 73% of all the remaining BTC's were accumulated at addresses which only receive and never send bitcoins, and that 70% of these 73% (i.e., 51%) are dormant bitcoins in the sense that they were received more than three months before our cuto date but\nafter it became easy to exchange them. If instead of summing the transaction values we sum the \nnal balances of all the addresses that were active after July 18th 2010 but became inactive in the last three months, we get that 55% of all\ncoins in the system are dormant in this sense. This is strong evidence that the majority of bitcoins are not circulating in the system, and since it is based on the address rather than the entity graph, this conclusion is not aected by possible\ninaccuracies in the way we associate addresses with users.",1365419899

For me, the first real experience of disassembling was with DOS games, when you would use a TSR (terminate and stay resident) debugger to hook into a running executable and try and figure out what it was doing. I think at the time I was mostly interested in hacking infinite lives - I was a lousy gamer.<p>I remember one of the tricks used by apps was to encrypt the code in some way, and rely on the DOS single-step interrupt to execute the decryption process as the code was run, one instruction at a time. The idea was to prevent static disassembly with the encryption while also discouraging run-time analysis (since a debugger would usually overwrite the single-step interrupt that fired off the decrypter).<p>I actually ended up writing my own TSR debugger that could step through such code by chaining the interrupts. It could also detect many of the self extracting compression formats and jump past the decompression stage on startup so you didn't spend the first 10 minutes trying to step through decompression code. I was quite proud of that app.<p>Then in the late 90s I moved on to Windows disassembly, when I became somewhat obsessed with uncovering the undocumented APIs in Windows 95. I even had a Geocities website where I used to publish some of my findings. The site is obviously gone now, but it's still mirrored in a few places.<p>In case anyone is interested, there's a mirror here: <a href=""http://koti.mbnet.fi/vaultec/files/miscellaneous/undocw95/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://koti.mbnet.fi/vaultec/files/miscellaneous/undocw95/</a>",1365419483

And crossover is 90% of evolution (in fact some claim that genetic programming works just as well or better with no mutations whatsoever and only crossover being used.)",1365419430
5511009,comment,5510423,5510423,5,0,scott_w,,,"From the comments, a lot of people are taking the wrong message from this article.<p>It's not ""get stuck in and don't think about it"", it's actually: ""think about what needs to be done, then start with the hardest"".<p>It's actually something I learned during a group project during university. The process is something like:<p>* Group all your main features<p>* Plot them on a graph of importance (y-axis) vs difficulty (x-axis)<p>* The features in the top-right (high importance/high difficulty) are the first things you do<p>* The features in the bottom-right (low importance/high difficulty) are the last things you do<p>This is something you have to keep evaluating over time, using a process/method of your preference (that works, of course).<p>The reason you do the hard/important things first is because it lets you know whether the project can go ahead for the minimal cost.<p>To take the group project I did as an example: we had to do a mapping application on a mobile device. Most groups went and wrote some code in Java, and wrote a routing algorithm. A few of us realised that getting something running on a device was the ""hard"" part, so set about getting that working. Afterwards, we went and drew some graphics, and handled some simple I/O with pre-programmed behaviour. When it came to writing the routing, we again tried everything against the device ASAP, so we knew what its real-world performance was.<p>Those who started writing Java without the device realised they had to convert it to J2ME before they could make it run, wasting a bunch of time. A good percentage had nearly nothing running by the end of the year demo because of this.",1365419396

5511006,comment,5509725,5510041,1,0,spmurrayzzz,,,"I think you're correct in saying that the training experience will require a high transaction cost and level of dedication.<p>But I think there is a correlation there with many of the points OP makes in his note. The dog won't train him/herself so you <i>must</i> dedicate yourself to some sort of schedule in order to reap any progress; if you won't, who will? This is well aligned with the first point OP makes.<p>I found the early period of my dog's training to be, by far, the most rewarding both in intrinsic and extrinsic manifestations. I now have a very well behaved dog and I've seen numerous latent benefits in my health and well-being as well.<p>Ill concede that the most important change I've seen in myself has been a decrease in selfishness and an overall increase in empathy. I am often doing things for my dog simply because I put myself in his shoes (e.g. making sure to take him out right before he goes to sleep, because I know how uncomfortable it is to try to sleep with a full bladder). This seems juvenile and seems like it should appeal to anyone with common sense, and it probably does, but for me it was an important lesson that translated universally across my current life experience. A lesson I likely wouldn't have learned without my dog to teach me.",1365419352

The ""early"" part of things is just a sound advice to avoid missing deadlines, but doesn't really help increase the quality of your work or reduce waste.<p>Early discovery to outline a draft strategy in small committee (one person is sometimes enough) helps the team with reaching velocity quickly once it gets started. The hard part is sustaining it until delivery of whatever it is you've set up as the target.<p>That's why sprints can be handy, reducing the amount that needs to be delivered so that the team doesn't get slowed down on a big block of work.",1365419301

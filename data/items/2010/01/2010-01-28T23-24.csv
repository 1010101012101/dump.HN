Windows was supported through MusicMatch (eww) on the 2g and 3g, and it was after the 3g release that iTunes came to windows.<p>And it was when iTunes came to Windows that the iPod took off in sales (ironically, reversing a LONG trend by Jobs to keep Apple products on the Apple platform). In 2002 and 2003 they sold less than a million units. The first quarter they had iTunes on windows, they moved over 2 million units--more than double what they'd sold the previous holiday quarter.<p>People look at the iPod as this huge instant hit.

By stepping on the brakes you're not directly controlling the brakes, but telling them to slow you down as quickly and safely as possible using whatever method it deems best, and most people consider that a good thing.  We're also starting to see more cars which auto break when they sense they're getting too close to things.  While I don't see a time when we'll have cars without a break pedal I do see that the break pedal will be abstracted further and further away from directly controlling the breaks.",1264719662

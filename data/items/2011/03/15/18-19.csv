But the broadcasting lobby has opposed the move ferociously, claiming that its unique exemption from payment is because radio has such promotional force for artists.""<p>I'm actually a fan of this portion of it. It brings radio broadcasting in line with the harsh limits put on webcasting. I'd rather it be the opposite - that the limits on webcasting were brought in line with the (lack of) limits on radio broadcasting, but this is a good second best.<p>The broadcasting establishment claims that radio is a huge promotional force for artists; why isn't the opposite true of webcasting (a la Pandora)? It would seem the promotion of artists is /better/ in webcasting, because the webcaster can link the listener directly to where they might purchase the artist's work - unlike in radio, where you must wait for the DJ to (maybe, once in a blue moon) announce what just played, and then have to google it yourself.",1300215434

2328876,comment,2327712,2327712,0,0,techietim,,,"As a soon to graduate high school senior and someone who seems to have the same interests as you, here are some of my thoughts:<p>1. Stay on the ball with your school work. I regret doing this myself. Freshman and sophomore year I had a decent average (85-90%), however, junior year I just got lazy. Most of my classes went down into the 70s and I was not enjoying myself. I'm in my final semester now, I have been accepted to university, but I'll most likely have to take out a big student loan as my average isn't good enough for most scholarships. I could have done better in those last two years of high school, but I didn't know how to manage my time. I'm getting better with it now, thankfully, and two tips I have for you are: (a) write down what homework you have for the evening on an ipod, notebook, or whatever you are guaranteed to look at once you get home. As soon as you get home, before you visit HN, reddit, or play any games(!), do that homework! You'll be able to focus better if you're not distracted by anything else, and you won't have to rush to finish it before bed (b) find time to do as much work as you can at school. If you happen to have a free period, study hall, or lunch break, take advantage of that. If you have something to do, find somewhere quite to work and JUST DO IT. You'll feel so much better after completing it and then you won't have to spend time at home on it. Don't let your friends talk you out of doing your homework to spend time with them, as there will be opportunities for that later. There's a due date on assignments, and you'll most likely not have another chance to get it done.<p>2. I've attended the canada-wide national science fair two times (hopefully a third. I'll find out soon), and this is something where one has to spend TONS of their free time working on a project. My projects were programming related, so I got to do what I enjoy doing and I won some cash and prizes doing so. However, there are huge time management issue with this. This is where finding those spare moments at school to do homework and assignments is really important.<p>3. Don't worry about a VPS. I know the feeling of wanting one though, but I've had to resist. There's just no practical reason why you actually NEED one. Before you buy something, ask yourself if it's something you actually need. If you would like to get a domain name (which can be helpful if you're advertising yourself on Kijiji or Craigslist for web dev.), you could just have a static HTML page (which most domain registrars allow you to have free), and have it link to your work (Github, etc.)<p>4. As others have pointed out, there are many free resources online. You just have to look.",1300215416

Since YC companies get funding, it's likely they'll require you to do the same.

A few years ago my employer was acquired by a much larger company; so I've been with my current employer only a few years, but was part of the previous company for nearly a decade.<p>Back when we were small and independent, I took on many roles which I felt were valuable to the company's success. Think of the technical responsibilities a small software development company with a successful OEM and online service would have, I have been responsible for them all at some point.<p>The trouble is under the new corporate umbrella, there isn't really a job position to describe my former role, and so I've been pigeonholed as a System Administrator, yet all my old roles still exist and are being fulfilled by me.<p>If I quit today I would be missed, as there are too many things that have been left undocumented and are known only to me. I, sadly, have only succeeded in taking one vacation without fielding at least a single phone call from the office (and I think this was due to me being out of the country more than anything).<p>I find myself in a position where the work is still interesting, and yet every so often (more and more frequently now) I find myself wanting to storm into my bosses office and just outright quit.

In the US many believe that things are already worse than what they're being told and would rather be ready to react immediately after something changes rather than be caught in the middle of the rage if something should go wrong later.

2328836,comment,2326545,2326545,0,0,yason,,,"I argue that TeX isn't widely used in nearly all of academia. Microsoft Word is awkwardly common, for what I've seen. The likelihood of TeX use grows with the probability of having to include complex equations into papers. This will emphasize—with perhaps the notable exception of CS—the sciences without the word 'science' in them.<p>Generally, it's easier to write logically structured text rather than physically structured text. Thus, instead of battling with physical layout people have a subtle incentive to try to let a computer automated some of that work for them in hope for productivity gains. Various text authoring tools and word processors can help with that to some extent.<p>The differences come into play as different software start cracking broke in different ways. Some people are never able to cross the border to something more complex and powerful and are thus forever limited to pixel-perfecting their MS Word layouts, equations, and formatting—quite complex and powerless in itself! Now, TeX has that power but comes with a steep learning curve and a significant load of archaic baggage. This means that, for people with certain inclination, it will be at some point be easier to battle with TeX than with other typesetting or text authoring programs.<p>TeX users don't probably drool its unlimited awesomeness. It just means that for many of them TeX is the best <i>known</i> tool for the job. If there ever is an another tool that allows them the power of TeX and yet comes with a good library of facades that shield them from the inevitable ugly innards it will probably win over many people over time.

While fuel is removed from a reactor because it is 'spent' that doesn't mean that it cannot still reach criticality, that is why it is stored in a pond where the water provides the moderation. Normally this wouldn't even be considered but given the challenge of getting water into the reactors, the use of sea water and venting the steam (which makes the room around the reactor temporarily dangerous), it seems the ponds are warming up and not getting the attention they need. It would be unfortunate to have the pond evaporate. Note that in some cases this pond is the holding area for new fuel as well (during a refueling operation) but there is no information available on the quantity, and current composition, of fuel rods in these ponds.<p>So I remain confident they will be able to get the reactors cooled off without causing them to be 'abandoned in place'.

Japan is indeed facing the release of a large cloud of highly radioactive steam carrying radioactive particles that were once part of the core.  Right now both the cores of several reactors and the spent fuel rods that are stored on site face the possibility of turning entirely molten and ending up in the atmosphere.  The reactors are fail-unsafe.  If everybody walked away now, a disaster worse than Chernobyl would result.  And as the situation at some of the reactors deteriorates, it becomes increasingly likely that workers are going to have to depart the area.  Remember, Chernobyl was actually better off than Fukushima in many ways - while one reactor was screwed, the others at the same plant were undamaged and could continue operating normally - cooling systems could continue to run, and so on.  The other 3 reactors were never in any danger at Chernobyl.  That is not true at Fukushima.<p>It is entirely possible - even likely at this point - that the fuel rods in at least 3 of Fukushima's reactors going to end up significantly spread over the Japanese countryside.  Overreaction is not really possible at this point.",1300213929

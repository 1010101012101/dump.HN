383391,comment,381099,381099,0,0,blurry,,,"My husband works in the fashion industry so I think I can provide a reasonably good answer as to why on-demand clothing isn't particularly feasible.<p>The way the industry works is, there are a few (much fewer than you think) vertically integrated companies that makes all our clothing. Let me illustrate what I mean by vertically integrated by explaining what my husband's company does.<p>Basically, they make stuff such as men's shirts under every imaginable label from lower end such as private label at J.C. Penney to mid-market brands like Nautica to up-market brands like Thomas Pink. They own the process <i>completely</i>, from growing the cotton to making the fabric to putting the shirts together in Asia to shipping into warehouses in the US to saying when the shirts go on sale. Other than labels providing a license (e.g. Calvin Klein granting the exclusive rights to make shirts under their label) and Macy's providing the floor space (Macy's being the same company as Bloomingdales, Lord & Taylor, Filene's, Marchall Field's, etc), they do <i>everything</i>.<p>As you can imagine, when you have a few companies covering every fashion category sold at practically every store, you have almost perfect efficiency. The cost savings for vertically integrated, economies-of-scale companies like my husband's are enormous to the point where you could never get anywhere close to the low, low prices they are able to charge.<p>So what you are left with is selling your custom stuff at price points that put you in the same category as designer clothing (often accompanied by free alterations) and custom tailoring. And why would someone buy a slightly customized cheap shirt/jeans/whatever when for the same money, they can buy an upmarket designer item, or have it tailor-made?<p>I am not saying you can't have some niche categories where you do customization. Cafe Press does pretty good with t-shirts. I just don't think there is a positive answer to your question, ""How can I give my designer friends the ability to do low-volume production cost-effectively"".",1228243362

It costs in terms of time and code elegance and versatility - often once you've optimised a piece of code to be fast, it's more complex, harder to understand, and harder to change.<p>Premature optimisation is bad because of this.<p>Taking things one step further, what is premature? Well, since your production architecture (if you're a start-up on a shoestring) may well be vastly different from your development architecture or your staging architecture (you may run your production site on a clustered EngineYard set-up that costs hundreds of dollars a month and your staging site on a VM that costs $20). And even if the architecture is identical, the data volumes and patterns may be different.<p>And even if you can afford an exact duplicate of your production environment, and keep the data exactly in sync with your production system, usage patterns may be different. And even if you can afford to simulate the usage patterns in a realistic manner, there will be differences in how the traffic gets routed on an IP level which will also cause the bottlenecks to shift.<p>All this to say, if you're a start-up on a budget, do not optimise until you see a problem in production. You may well be surprised by how it's not the bottlenecks you expected that actually slow you down. My application has no indexes in the database, because so far, database access has <i>never</i> been a bottleneck. On the other hand, ruby parsing of objects, and AMF rendering of them, and complex aggregation operations on the objects - all those have caused problems that I only found once I was able to observe them happening in a production environment.<p>Simple solution: don't optimise before you see the problem begin to develop in production.",1228241112

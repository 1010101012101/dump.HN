The issue is that when you have a monopoly or near-monopoly (oligopoly), the prices are primarily determined not by the cost for the sellers, but by the value for the buyers.<p>Therefore, unless the amount of value that each byte of cellular data transfer provides decreases significantly for a significant portion of the telecom companies' customers, the prices won't decrease, regardless of what changes occur in the costs to the companies.<p>That is, of course, unless the government steps in as it has in other countries and artificially fosters competition, so that the cost to the  companies plays a more significant role in determining the prices.",1275796755

(the rest is not related to the above quote)<p>Alan mentions that education doesn't happen fast enough. Here's a crazy idea, what if we leveraged the Internet to accelerate education? If 100 average programmers from HN paid $1000/year to a great computer scientist to teach them a few lessons per week it seems like everyone would win. That's a simple example and there would be overhead costs for the infrastructure to setup such a system, but it could have some interesting results. It would have the potential to become a new kind of higher education. You could choose to subscribe only to people you were interested in learning from.<p>I know there are a lot of unanswered questions about how it would all work. A big one in my mind is whether it would be interactive & collaborative, or broadcast style? I'd lean towards the former even though it'd be more complex.",1275796004

1407948,comment,1407464,1407464,0,0,pragmatic,,,"Often, you are only interested in a ""view"" of this object.  A subset of the total methods and data of the real world object.    For example, an inventory app may only car about the MSRP, dealer's cost, etc and not necessarily implementing the  functions of a real car ( horn.honk() door.IsOpened).<p>Now, software inside the car may well want to abstract the horn.honk() function for use.  (maybe, i'm doubting it's that clean in implementation).<p>Anyway, not ever app cares about ever aspect of every real world object.  Hence lack of re-usability.  Even 2 LOB (line of business) app may have different views to the same object.  For instance, a telecom circuit.  One app is concerned with the physical layout/design, where it runs, what equipment, what locations, what size (bandwidth) etc, etc.  While another app may account for this circuit, figuring cost and revenue.  Both may share data, but much more likely at a database level than actually pulling objects out of one, straight into another.  I've just not seen that level of re-use in biz apps.  String is used all over the place, but a highly specialized class for telecom accounting?  Probably not.  However, these apps probably share customer information because customer contact info is useful for billing and trouble shooting connectivity issues.<p>So object re-use works great as a software vendor like Sun(oracle) or Microsoft.  Java and .Net have some objects that see major re-use.  Network, strings, web, drawing, etc.  Very common, very easy to re-use.  But LOB apps just don't have that re-usability.  If they did, why would they need to hire you to work on them?  They could just pull it out of the box.",1275795314

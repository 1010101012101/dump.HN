7747572,comment,7746750,7747444,1,0,coherentpony,,,">That is not true. You can mathematically divide by zero, just not over the Reals (or any other nonzero commutative ring). There is no reason that you cannot define a number system where division by zero is allowed, however in doing so you loose some nice properties that we enjoy about the Real numbers. A common example from math is the real projective line (which adds a point at infinity, and defines that a/0=infinity when a=/=0).<p>I should have been a little clearer there.  Thanks.<p>I absolutely agree with you.  But the domain and range of the functions I defined were all subsets of the reals.  And computers don&#x27;t deal with number systems other than the reals very well.  (In fact, computers don&#x27;t even deal with the reals themselves very well either!)<p>There are some packages that allow one to operate over those spaces, but they are not commonly used in the commercial space.  And, of course, it&#x27;s fairly easy to extend the reals to the complexes.<p>Thanks for pointing that out.",1400119073

In general I subscribe to the principle that there&#x27;s a proportionality appropriate to disclosure:  that the greater a person&#x27;s (or institution&#x27;s) power and responsibility, the greater the obligation for disclosure of <i>relevant</i> details of their life, most particularly as it might affect others (individuals, organizations, government(s), etc.).",1400119055

An arguably more serious issue with IEEE floats is rounding modes. The round up/round down modes are tantalizingly close to providing the ability to do ironclad approximate real arithmetic in the sense that you could give upper/lower bounds on the exact value. The problem is that the rounding modes only involve giving an upper/lower bound on the output given an <i>exact</i> input, rather than an upper/lower bound on the output given an upper/lower bound on the input.

An irreversible bit operation (e.g., xoring or anding two bits together), by Landauer&#x27;s principle [1], costs at least 7.92x10^-28 kWh.I don&#x27;t know what is the minimum number of bit operations on SHA-256, but it must be at least 256 times 64 rounds. A collision attack costs approximately 2^128 evaluations, which gives us 256x64x7.92x10^-28x2^128 ~ 2^52 kHw for a collision.

It is true that EME is not a major force on desktop yet. But, Netflix - the most popular streaming video service - has written an EME player. It is moving towards that, and the hollywood studios as well. Those studios will not support anything but EME.<p>Currently Flash is supported by the studios, to some extent. But even that is problematic - Flash has dropped Linux support and is not present on mobile. Not only is EME being pushed by Netflix, Hollywood, Google and Microsoft, but also Flash is no fallback.<p>The result is that soon you will need EME to view Netflix. People will not use a browser that does not support Netflix. It&#x27;s a simple as that. Yes, there are some principled people that refuse to use DRMed content, and those people are already not using EME-supporting browsers like Chrome and Internet Explorer, but look at their market share.

It doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot customization options, but it&#x27;s more of a linkblog than a programming blog and the defaults are good enough for that purpose. It doesn&#x27;t do markdown and I don&#x27;t think you can export, so I don&#x27;t recommend it for your purpose.<p>On my Mithril blog ( <a href=""http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lhorie.github.io/mithril-blog</a> ), I&#x27;m using a custom build script based on grunt+marked and Disqus (you can check the github project page if it interests you). Some of the publishing steps are still a little manual though, so it&#x27;s probably not what you&#x27;re looking for, but I&#x27;ve stuff like syntax highlighting setup there if you want to steal the code for a starting boilerplate.<p>Recently someone from the Mithril community showed me a simple Jekyll+Mithril blog platform that sounds closer to what you&#x27;re looking for: ( <a href=""https://github.com/eiriksm/kyll-thrill"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/eiriksm/kyll-thrill</a> ). It&#x27;s pretty lean, you can write posts in markdown, create a HTML template, and use Disqus for comments (it does RSS too). I&#x27;m planning on trying it out myself.<p>Re: portability, I think having the articles in markdown files is the way to go if you want to be able to move the content to other micro-blogging tools.<p>As far as domains go, I use my personal blog for writing about more random (but still programming-related) things, e.g. Angular or Velocity.js or whatever, and I keep application-development-focused content on the Mithril blog. You can always do a mysite.com/blog that is primarily focused on Angular, but occasionally talk about other things. As a reader, this type of blog feels more human, and I personally like the occasional insights that come out of deviations from the core topic.",1400117664

Surely preserving the law x==x is more important than the law x==y <=> x-y==0.<p>Then we have:<p>> Regarding your comment &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean that the correct answer is false&quot;, this is wrong. The predicate (y < x) asks whether y is less than x. If y is NaN, then it is not less than any floating-point value x, so the answer is necessarily false.<p>Clearly this reasoning is incorrect for the simple reason that the same reasoning can lead to the opposite conclusion. If y is NaN then we can&#x27;t say that y < x is definitely true but neither can we say that y < x is definitely false.<p>Here is my argument for why NaN == NaN should be true. The == operator for floats should rarely be used. If you want to know whether two floats can be considered the same, then you should always use some other condition like  |x-y| < epsilon, and NOT x == y. The reason is that floating point arithmetic is inexact, so even a slight roundoff error will make x == y false. So if its job is <i>not</i> to test whether two floats are the same <i>numerically</i> then what is the job for the == operator? Its job is to test whether x and y are precisely the same <i>float</i>. The x == y operator should not pretend to work on the abstraction that x and y are kinda-sorta real numbers, because such an operator is useless anyway because the criterion for that needs to be application specific. It should compare floats while admitting that we are comparing floats which can take on the value +infinity -infinity +0 -0 and NaN, and we are not comparing real numbers which do not have those values. That&#x27;s why NaN == NaN should be true.",1400116448

7747444,comment,7746750,7747121,2,0,gizmo686,,,">Note:  you are not allowed to divide by zero.  The result would be meaningless if you could.  And &#x27;NaN&#x27; is only something the computer spits out when it encounters an operation that doesn&#x27;t return a number.  Usually, a computer will give you &#x27;Inf&#x27; when you try to divide by zero numerically.  Mathematically, you cannot do it.  So don&#x27;t try.<p>That is not true. You can mathematically divide by zero, just not over the Reals (or any other nonzero commutative ring). There is no reason that you cannot define a number system where division by zero is allowed, however in doing so you loose some nice properties that we enjoy about the Real numbers. A common example from math is the real projective line (which adds a point at infinity, and defines that a/0=infinity when a=/=0).<p>Another commonly used number system that defines division by zero is the IEEE floating-point standard. In fact, IEEE defines division for all values of 0 (it has a positive and a negative 0). Specifically:<p><pre><code>    a/+0=+infinity | a>0\n    a/+0=-infinity  | a<0\n    a/-0 =-infinity  | a>0\n    a/-0 = +infinity | a<0\n    0/0  = NaN | for any combination of 0 values\n</code></pre>\nThese definitions would cause floating point arithmetic to loose some nice properties of the Reals, however it provides the property of division being defined everywhere, and other decisions made already caused floating point arithmetic to not have the properties.",1400115855

10025728,comment,10024958,10025699,0,0,eropple,,,"<i>You&#x27;re in AWS.</i> Why do you think alerts mean you need to be watching for them? Alerts come from CloudWatch, to SNS, and from that can go wherever you want them to. So do that, with the tools they&#x27;ve already given you. And this lets you kill only what you want to kill--I mean, do you want them to dump all your S3 buckets? Or just, say, down all your EC2 nodes?<p>It&#x27;s not about capping features being negative for revenue, it&#x27;s that the customers who want it <i>don&#x27;t matter</i>; if it&#x27;s not something a company dropping $20K/month is going to use, I doubt it&#x27;s really worth the time of day.

10025725,comment,10023818,10025648,0,0,Retra,,,"Eighty columns is a good standard, I just think people forget how small it can be, and why it isn&#x27;t always a problem. I&#x27;ve written tons of code that looks fantastic, if only I could use 85 columns, but rewriting it to use less just makes use of some pretty clunky constructs. All these extra &quot;()&quot;s and &quot;/&quot;s aren&#x27;t <i>actually</i> helping make the line more readable, it just makes it fit into a rather arbitrary column limit. And at that point, you&#x27;d be thinking that the best way to make your code the most readable it can be is to use more columns.<p>So I don&#x27;t think 80 cols is a hard limit, anymore than I think writing code in a terminal is a hard limit. I use a non-terminal text editor. I do it <i>because</i> it makes it easier to read code and format it how I like. I see little reason why anyone should be jumping through hoops to accommodate that. By using a terminal editor, you&#x27;ve already decided you won&#x27;t get the best formatting, because you sacrifice the flexibility that allows it in exchange for something else. You should be expecting things to wrap around awkwardly on occasion.<p>Eighty columns is a good target width, but it&#x27;s not worth proliferating clunky constructs to conform to. That&#x27;s no better than having code wrap. (Of course, someone could also write terminal editors that allow text to go longer than 80 lines. Why are you using an editor like that if it can&#x27;t do something this simple?)",1438991836

That&#x27;s democracy: the people of Europe gets what it wants.&quot;<p>No, that&#x27;s not democracy, that&#x27;s a free market.  There&#x27;s a big difference:  democracy is about electing representatives to pursue your preferred policy goals.  These goals may or may not support personal or economic freedom.  One might want to use a service on the free market and at the same time want their elected representatives to constrain its competitive strength to enable local competition.   Mainly this should be done in the interest of consumers or it gets too distortionary.   I&#x27;m not claiming Google harms consumers, I&#x27;m just saying that (for example) Google has massive negative implications on privacy which are concerning.<p>&quot;Now pass a &quot;democratic&quot; law to ban Dropbox because it&#x27;s not hosted in France, and all we&#x27;re left with is the opposite of democracy. &quot;<p>Actually, no.  What you&#x27;re left with is a democratically elected government that is closing their trade market somewhat in favor of other interests.<p>Note, nowhere did I suggest it was a good idea to ban a company from trading with a country.   That would be a bad policy unless there was a very strong reason and popular support.   Constraining behavior, on the other hand, might or might not be a bad policy.  Hard to know.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just a matter of performance... until the law comes into play, in less than democratic ways, to cut competition.&quot;<p>I agree the free market and free enterprise is all about performance and results, and the law doesn&#x27;t care about such things.   But that&#x27;s why democracy exists - sometimes efficiency and performance is NOT what the populace wants.   They want change and competition to be slowed by laws and regulations.   People do not respond to change as quickly as the markets sometimes want them to.<p>All of this are just policy differences between laissez-faire free market and more socialist policies.   They have their tradeoffs but are both legitimate (one is not more &quot;democratic&quot; than the other).",1438989879

There&#x27;s not really a huge amount of really detailed information out there on how the different servers work and the tradeoffs between them.<p>RE threads on MRI, I think it comes down to what your latency requirements are and the type of work as you said. I&#x27;m happy with sidekiq on MRI because it doesn&#x27;t matter hugely if the process gets bogged down for 60 seconds while a ruby-heavy job runs and the other jobs run slowly - jobs are only pulled from redis when there is a spare thread, and sidekiq jobs won&#x27;t timeout like web requests do. IO-heavy work will get a boost with threads on Puma, but if you get a single Ruby-heavy request running for 20 seconds serializing something, you are going to get timeouts happen.<p>I guess it does depend on the type of app you are running - Ours is actually quite Ruby-crunching heavy, because it has to serialize some big json responses, which is still incredibly slow in Rails. Apps which don&#x27;t have occasional Ruby-intensive requests wouldn&#x27;t have as much trouble with all this :)",1438989103

3173894,comment,3173504,3173504,7,0,willyt,,,"While it's quite interesting that someone has made a 3d printer this big. You can't literally print a house with one of these. Just think about a typical wall build up, it will be something like this: dry lining, vapour control layer, insulation, air gap, <magic printed sandstone structure>, waterproofing and or rain screen. The basics you need are to be able to print a structure which is waterproof, has a U-Value of 0.2 w/mk, is fire resistant and has some tensile strength. The material in the OP is 'like sandstone' which is structurally useful only in compression. So you couldn't print a skyscraper or Frank Lloyd Wright's 'falling water'. If they could print fibre reinforced concrete then it wouldn't be so limiting.<p>Also, bear in mind that the 'shell and core'; the structure, cladding and primary circulation is generally less than half the cost of the finished building. E.g. all the HVAC still has to be installed by hand. Innovation in construction is notoriously slow moving; even quite simple innovations can take 50 years to be widely adopted. It's also incredibly heavily regulated in most countries. I think that modular construction is more interesting avenue to explore. Most buildings are the equivalent of 'spaghetti code' there is lots of progress that can be made by modularising parts and standardising interfaces. Architects like Bucknister Fuller, Otto Frei, and others did lots of interesting work in the 1950's on modularisation but the concept hasn't developed much since then.",1319961001

It's thought that all of these statues were put up in a race by chieftains, competing with one another to put up the biggest, most refined and the best statue.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if they competed in their standards of life too. (""I eat X for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"") I certainly wouldn't be surprised by the fact that they might have had political factions, special interests and a life rife with complicated political maneuvering. (it was certainly in the short term interests of statue makers to be against conservation and egg chieftains on)<p>After all we're the same species and they were just like us.<p>However what they failed to realize was the inescapable fact that they were living on a small piece of land in the middle of a vast ocean. Their seemingly inexhaustible resources were pitiful by any standards.<p>As time wore on and their population boomed, a point came when all of these factors came together. Their squandering of resources combined with their unsustainable way of life for a large population faced off with their limited resources, and the result was ugly. Their entire civilization collapsed.<p>Most of the population was lost to famine. Their civilization descended to cannibalism to survive. This degraded civilization became the perfect breeding ground for disease and even more people died. This cycle went on and on until their entire civilization was wiped out and the entire population nearly eradicated.<p>I shudder to think what it must have been like to live in this world. It must have been a nightmare.<p>Today like the eastern islanders with their statues, we keep on building taller and taller structures, better and more lethal weapons, and crazier systems. We compete with one another for status symbols at personal, regional and national levels.<p>Today we are just as isolated on this tiny blue ball, with a finite amount of resources, a booming population, combined with special interests and huge egos.<p>Like the eastern islanders we have nowhere to go...",1319960808

3173859,comment,3173204,3173204,1,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"My two cents: to have a scalable distributed application you're ultimately going to have to build a kind of SOA with the Django/Symfony/RoR frontend talking to your backend services via API calls. So the framework just handles fetching data and laying it out nicely while the real work happens on the backend.<p>Once you have this, you can optimize your application to handle all kinds of workloads without getting bogged down by whatever framework you're using. Heck, write your CPU-intensive code in C++ if you're so kooky about performance, use SQL or OODBs, whatever. Distribute you application across the globe. Your application is ultimately just responding to HTTP requests.<p>Use Django for the frontend. Use whatever you want for your backend. Using Python for both would be nice. If you're really worried about performance, use a JVM language like Scala. Ultimately, this choice will be driven by what kind of computation you're doing on your backend. E.g, if I was doing scientific computation I'd use Python because it has NumPy and SciPy. Let the backend decision be driven by what language has the libraries you need. You absolutely _do not_ want to write code when you can avoid it.<p>That said, I must bring your attention to a few points:<p>(1) Premature optimization is bad. If you don't know whether you'll need it, then you won't need it.<p>(2) Just-in-time scaling, i.e, scaling right when you start facing performance problems is going to be hard. If you know you will <i>totally definitely 100%</i> need it, plan for it now.<p>(3) 99% of web applications don't need to worry about scaling. Throwing more hardware at the problem, intelligent caching, and some basic Algorithms 101 techniques go a long way towards making things fast.<p>(4) I'm not in the Valley, and I've never built a large scale web application ;)",1319959707
3173858,comment,3173560,3173824,1,0,antics,,,"Adding to the above, when we talk about monitoring people, most people have in mind a model that requires O(log n) monitors; monitoring 300 people is like keeping 300 bookmarks in a book, as it takes only a few people to monitor those 300 bookmarks. To the government, the model is O(n). They're not maintaining 300 bookmarks, they're reading 300 pages simultaneously.<p>The reason is that people are the asymptotic bottleneck. If computers totally and automatically understood everything, then the dominating term would be compute time. But it's not. The dominating term is <i>clearly</i> people, who must ultimately review the truly promising information. Maybe the compute resources make this linear relationship hold over lower constants, but it is still definitely linear. And any technological advantage is unfortunately shortchanged by the constant factor of red tape.<p>Ex-Googlers like Ron here no doubt have a different view on what can/should be done to monitor people, but I argue that this is irrelevant to the government.

Sure, I can manually install the driver and set up Xorg.conf, but I just don't want to do that. Luckily there's also an integrated Intel graphics card.<p>* VGA port does not work (no presentations using the projector for me) because of previous point.<p>* The wireless keeps freezing.

This also is something I'm sure can be fixed by jumbling around with drivers, but again - I just don't want to do that.<p>* Gnome is horrible. I might be spoiled (lets face it: I AM spoiled) by Apple and their 'everything just works' - which it pretty much does as far as UI goes. Currently I'm running Xfce, which I found to be pleasantly simple. I found Gnome to be buggy and annyoing.

It's supposed to bring Linux to the people, isn't it? Well, it's not doing a good job of that. I installed Ubuntu to have a system that just works.

You can write <i>'a'.equals(foo)</i> as long as foo is an Object.<p>In contrast, look at Haskell's (==) function declared in Eq (I'm not giving an example using Num because Haskell provides some implicit conversions for numeric literals, which would introduce an unrelated complication in the example).<p><pre><code>    (==) :: (Eq a) => a -> a -> Bool
</code></pre>
This functions accepts 2 arguments of any one type, as long that type is an instance of Eq. But we cannot use different types in the same call. That is, we can write ('a' == 'b') and (""foo"" == ""bar"") but not ('a' = ""foo""), because (==) is not defined for a Char and a String.",1319958464

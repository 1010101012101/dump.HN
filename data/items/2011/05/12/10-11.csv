2540113,comment,2537992,2540067,1,0,6ren,,,"Thanks. You could also recreate the list with the new ordering; or record the changes in list order and replay them on server (e.g. insert the 5th one after the 2nd one), perhaps even reducing it to the simplest change if the user played around with the order a lot.<p>But I guess for RDB (and other DB?), the ""physical"" order isn't meant to be used as a ""logical"" order, and it might not even be reliable - so you need some other ordering mechanism, like position numbers. Also, not good if anything in the system depends on that physical ordering.<p>\not a DB programmer",1305197816

Some pirates aren't convertible because they are complete jerks, or don't have money, or any number of other reasons that make conversion impossible.

They -will- pay for a product that has value and meets their needs.<p>This article is a good example of failing to meet those needs.  His piracy prevention tactics actually make it easier to pirate the game than buy it!<p>True story:  I have a friend who bought some software and liked it.  Then he reinstalled Windows and it wouldn't install.  He contacted tech support and tried for 2 weeks to get them to fix the problem.  He gave up, pirated it, and then emailed them telling him that he pirated it instead.  Yes, a product he already owned.  The next day they sent him a new registration code that fixed the problem.

And the constant changes which Steve goes about with ensures that fewer and fewer developers will put up with it. The iTunes integration <i>and requirement</i> is for most people a bug, not a feature.<p>Preference for iOS is like you said, a preference, but it's hardly warranted. This thing haven't moved an inch since launch.<p>Loyalty to Apple corporation is a mental handicap to everyone not bitten by Steve Jobs RDF. Why on earth would you be loyal to a corporation? I'm loyal to me and my needs, and I want the best. The iPhone isn't.<p>Integration with Apple TV, a product useless in most parts of the world. Gee thanks. I'll consider it once Apple opens its TV/Movie store where I live, something they haven't done 3 years after they launched the music store.<p>Fashion? Are you serious? It may have been fashion a year ago, but right now everyone are getting Android phones. Apple haven't gotten any successor to the iPhone 4 out, and most Android phones in sale now, not to mention the dual-core models coming out as we speak, surpass the iPhone 4 on every metric.<p>The iPhone was a success based on it being the king of the smartphone game, and now it is slowly but surely lagging behind. Unless Apple does something unheard of with the iPhone 5 (including a near-complete rewrite of iOS) they will still be lagging when it comes out. They will release a device with dated software on day one and then they have lost. They will no longer be the better or premium option, they'll just have a glossy look.<p>I realize I'm an iPhone owner gone Android-fanatic. Yes. I am biased.

2540044,comment,2539788,2540001,13,0,ericd,,,"I gather from your comments that your moral code depends heavily on the rule of law. Many people don't base their moral code very heavily on the laws currently on the books, except as far as those laws reflect the original intent of law - to make the world a better place to live overall. It's generally agreed upon that stealing physical goods, murdering, etc. make the world a more unruly, unpleasant, inefficient, discouraging place for meek, cooperative people. Filesharing doesn't fall into the same league in those terms, so many don't really believe it's immoral, especially if one wasn't going to buy those files if there was no alternative. In that case, it's like happiness created from nothing. This other moral code makes the morality question a good bit murkier.<p>That's my understanding, anyway.",1305195619

Let's say the neighbor has a car you like and you have no money to buy such a car. You press the button and you get the copy of the car. Did you steal it from your neighbor? No, he still has his. Did you steal it from the manufacturer? Well, some may say that, because you got something that they produce without paying them, but: a) you'd never buy that car from them anyway (see condition #2), b) they still got all the money for the cars they <i>produced</i>, there is not a single missing. \nSo, whom did you steal the car from?<p>No consider more realistic scenario: I torrent the movie. You may call this a theft.\nNow slightly modified scenario: I buy the DVD on amazon.com, but while it's shipping I torrent the same movie and watch it. Is it still a theft?<p>Or if I torrent the movie first, like it a lot, go to see it in cinema, then go to see the second time with my wife, and to top all that I also buy a DVD? How about now, is it still the theft?<p>My point is: there is a real difference between an illegal copy and a theft, not just some semantics.<p>If I torrent something ""getting for free"" is never the reason to do that. The reasons are either availability or convenience. If there was a way to buy movies in digital format (I cannot even buy music on iTunes in my country, only apps) I'd spend <i>a lot</i> more money on them.

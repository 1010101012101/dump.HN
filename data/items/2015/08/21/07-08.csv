Something might be considered an error in the callee, but at the same time it might be an acceptable result in the caller, for which a well-defined path exists. Throwing an exception in such situations is just disconnecting the faulting code from the error handling code.",1440143982

10096394,comment,10094326,10095231,0,0,pietjepuk88,,,"I have also been at it for a while now. What I notice nowadays is that the same English->Japanese cards keep coming up quite often, because they have very similar cards/synonyms. Therefore, when adding new words, I take extra precaution to come up with a short 2-4 word sentence that is unique enough and captures the meaning quite well. Sometimes it might take me a few tries though, when I end up confusing it with another card anyway. This may also mean that sometimes I have to go and change a card/note I made a few years ago, because it &#x27;conflicts&#x27; with something I want to add now.<p>So with regard to the clippings feature I feel that generating single-word flash cards might come back to bite you. It makes English->Japanese &quot;production&quot; difficult and annoying in the long run. On the other hand, it also makes Japanese->English unnecessarily complicated with all the meanings associated with a single word. A relatively simple example that comes to mind is 手入れ, of which I would rather have two short sentences describing each use case. Or with regards to the clippings feature, I want it to generate the card with the meaning I encountered, because the other meanings of that word might never actually be used by the Japanese.<p>I am not sure an app will (or even should) be able to generate such cards. Condensing both the Japanese, while getting the English meaning right, is hard enough for a human. It certainly would be awesome, because at the moment I have to resort to generating the cards manually for the words/sentences I encounter while reading manga or books on my Kobo e-reader. History shows that (1) I am too lazy to generate a card for a word that I had to look up, and that I tend to just keep on reading (and forgetting the word again later on), or (2) that I actually stop reading for a few days/weeks because I feel I have to enter the back log of cards in Anki before continuing.",1440143623

We do have some, but it&#x27;s &quot;constrained&quot; competition, defined in a way that will never be truly disruptive to BT.<p>The natural monopoly BT has is the core network and the geographical exchanges in every town. In the case of BT it was handed a national network which it then gets to monetise: in return it had to continue to provide &#x27;universal service&#x27;. The problem with this type of set-up is that it puts BT in the position where their best minds are in an arms race against the regulator: they use all sorts of tricks to show how expensive their core network is and they make it very difficult for alternative providers. It&#x27;s just natural, if they can create barriers to competitors or price competitors out then it&#x27;s to their benefit.<p>While I&#x27;m not in that industry more I&#x27;m citing personal experience - I was at a provider when ADSL was coming onto the scene and they made it very difficult and complex to form your own backbone network. It means that you&#x27;re going to &quot;innovate&quot; on top of the BT network - which will never be disruptive to BT.<p>There are other situations where you can see the level of monopoly they have. For example, they basically held the government to ransom when they said they &quot;might&quot; not built the advanced network (21CN) which got them a pile of cash.<p>It&#x27;s consumers and business outside of the South East (London) that suffer - consumers because it&#x27;s basically everyone is held to the speed of BT&#x27;s innovation, and business outside the South East because there often aren&#x27;t alternatives.",1440143173

Otherwise, just do your thing.<p>All of the above also ignores that people change times at different times (11pm, 1am, 2am, 3am), some don&#x27;t change a full hour, and some don&#x27;t change at all.<p>The proposal gets rid of all of that convoluted logic in everyone&#x27;s programs, and instead it provides a single boolean value: is this the second time I&#x27;ve seen this time because of daylight savings shenanigans.",1440142512

A Kindle is an ok fallback (for me at least)<p>Get some exercise — I feel way better after running even just 1 mile.

Find out what&#x27;s right for you.<p>Take some melatonin — It did me a lot of good when I used to have trouble sleeping.<p>Address the sources of anxiety in your life — A comparison of how well I sleep now vs. when I had a lot of anxiety in my life (stress from working at Microsoft, stress from trying to drag along my faltering startup, etc.) is stark. I don&#x27;t fall asleep with much or any worry most nights.<p>Worst case scenario: ask a doctor to prescribe you Ambien or the like. Re-establish a decent sleeping pattern, and then figure out how to address everything else.<p>Edit: There&#x27;s one thing I want to mention about exercising. I started running only two months ago after what essentially amounts to a lifetime of non-exercise. I wasn&#x27;t overweight by any means—I was just plain skinny. Like, sort of the way you expect your average nerd to be skinny. After my first run of barely a mile (walking about half of it), I wondered if I was going to have a heart attack. I didn&#x27;t, thankfully. And now, two months later, I can run a longer distance than my first run/walk with basically no trouble whatsoever. I feel great, have more energy, and sleep better.<p>You don&#x27;t even have to start running. Just start walking. Here&#x27;s a better story than I can offer you at the moment on the value of this: <a href=""http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/06/16/apple-watch-my-most-personal-review-ever/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/06/16/apple-watch-my-most-pe...</a> and <a href=""http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/06/18/follow-up-to-how-i-lost-over-40-pounds-using-healthkit-and-apple-watch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loopinsight.com/2015/06/18/follow-up-to-how-i-los...</a><p>You don&#x27;t need an Apple Watch. You don&#x27;t need a health tracker. Just move. It feels better every day, and—I promise—within a month or two you&#x27;ll start craving it. It&#x27;s an awesome feeling.",1440140602

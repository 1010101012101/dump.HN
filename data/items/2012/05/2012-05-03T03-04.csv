There's version control, editing, code intelligence, test suites and test runners, different sorts of environments, and more.  And every possible permutation and nuanced setup depending on the runtime you're using and depending on how opinionated and/or fickle the community is around whichever language you're using.<p>Meta-problems of this kind are seldom discussed directly and are difficult to improve upon.

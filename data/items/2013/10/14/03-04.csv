6545337,comment,6543882,6543882,2,0,memracom,,,"I think that the choice boils down to one of these three:<p>Ubuntu LTS\nCentOS\nOpenSUSE<p>Some people swear by Mint or Debian but for most people, there is little to no difference from Ubuntu. Even for servers, using the Ubuntu server install to build a headless server is quick and simple. After that, install something like Docker to install any other services that you require.<p>I happen to run Ubuntu LTS on the desktop with the GUI reverted to Gnome Classic. There is a package to add that option. But I run CentOS on servers most recently.<p>I used to run OpenSUSE and only really switched because I needed to get a more balanced experience with other distros. My last OpenSUSE server was a XEN vm host and OpenSUSE made that much easier to set up than plain XEN on OpenSolaris which is what I had used before.<p>One note about a GUI environment. If you can, leave it off the base server and install it with Docker or KVM or Virtualbox. This may mean that you have to manage two servers in one, and use the CLI a lot, but this is a good learning experience. Modern computers are so fat and fast, that we forget how Linux was in the early days, filling a T1 line using a 486 with 128M of RAM and a 512M hard drive.",1381723143
6545336,comment,6543277,6545264,2,0,pdonis,,,"But profit is what tells you that what you are doing is valuable, i.e., that it is <i>not</i> a waste (no scare-quotes) of money, or more importantly, of the time and effort of the people involved. So the fact that Ovishinsky&#x27;s company made a profit while he was running it is not an accident: it is a consequence of the fact that his inventions were valuable, so that spending his time and effort, and that of his employees, on them was worth doing.<p>Your definition of &quot;waste&quot; appears to be something that you think is worth doing, but which does not make a profit. But if it is worth doing, why is it not making a profit? And if it is not worth doing, why put &quot;waste&quot; in quotes? People&#x27;s time and effort would be better spent on something else.<p>Finally, if you want to spend your own time and effort (and money) on something that others might consider to be not worth doing, that&#x27;s your choice. But when you talk about convincing others to &quot;waste&quot; money, you are no longer just committing your own time and effort (and money); you are committing theirs. The track record of this method of organizing human activity when not constrained by the need to make a profit (in order for the activity to stay in business) is not good.",1381723138

The last decade&#x27;s price increases have been driven by the lack of other perceived safe haven investments. Treasuries/Gilts pay below inflation now. That money found a new home: property in tier one global cities.<p>>The author makes note of the low &quot;property taxes&quot; in London which is just spurious.<p>Oh come on. Would high taxes on a house make it a more or less attractive investment?<p>>A 5m house does not generate 10x the garbage of a 500k house.<p>THIS is spurious. Irrespective of whether that&#x27;s true or not (it&#x27;s not: a 5m house probably takes up more valuable land, which is made valuable by everything surrounding it - transportation, shops, parks, etc.), it still doesn&#x27;t change the fact that low taxes make property a much more attractive investment.<p>>It&#x27;s true that the current state of the global economy has meant that fearful foreigners have brought their money and bought property<p>It&#x27;s foreigners who have checked out every other safe investment and seen how pathetically they pay. Seen the interest rate on Gilts?<p>Some are also (rightly) fearful of their home governments (Russians, Chinese, Arabs), and want to park their money in a country where the government is unlikely to decide to confiscate it one day.<p>>this tends to be at the very high end of the market which shouldn&#x27;t be affecting the middle class that he&#x27;s referring to.<p>Except:<p>A) It does affect the middle classes too. Prices filter down. Everybody who was buying at the high end of the market and gets priced out buys something lower down, which prices <i>them</i> out and so on. Land used on expensive properties is not available for the middle classes.<p>B) It&#x27;s not just the very high end of the market. London property is being shopped all around the world, from Singapore to Hong Kong to the US as a safe investment for upper middle classes. I could show you a hundred glossy foreign magazines advertising property which is &quot;close&quot; to some tube station on the Piccadilly or Northern line 13-15 stops from the center.",1381723097

6545321,comment,6544025,6544739,1,0,millstone,,,"> what did America get in exchange for doubling the size of its government between 2000 and 2012?<p>That&#x27;s a valid question. Working from www.usgovernmentspending.com, I found the increase to be about $1.7 trillion. $300 billion is health care, mostly Medicaid; $500 billion from increased defense spending, and $300 billion in transfer payments, including unemployment, food stamps, SSI, and the child tax credit. Inflation accounts for about $500 billion as well.<p>So to answer your question, &quot;what we got&quot; is that we are able to pay for the increase in medical costs, the increase in the number of people needing assistance, and the War on Terror. With the exception of the military, these increases are mostly in reaction to the changes in the economy, not due to new policies. Hopefully an improving economy will lift incomes and reduce the need for these programs.",1381722971

People don&#x27;t want 99% compatibility, they need 100%, so other vendors have fallen out of the game because they can&#x27;t make the same level of investment.<p>As for being easy to learn, I think if you Google &quot;Microsoft Office classes&quot;, you&#x27;ll find that lots of people still require training.

6545293,comment,6544674,6544674,23,0,programminggeek,,,"The biggest problem with Microsoft after say 2005 was that it let things like Windows and Office drag it down to the point that if things competed with either, they were killed with fire.<p>For example, look at what Ray Ozzie got built with Azure, or what J Allard did with the Xbox, Xbox 360, Zune, and Courier. Azure was in a prime spot to do what Amazon ended up doing - being the computing platform for the cloud. Instead, nobody at Microsoft wanted to listen to Ray because selling Windows and Office on PC&#x27;s and servers is the thing that drives MSFT today. Thus, if it competed with either, it&#x27;s not going to get the kind of respect it deserves.<p>Look at where Microsoft is now on the consumer side. J Allard and his team were basically paving the way for Microsoft to make great consumer devices. Zune basically gave them Metro UI, Xbox 360 showed them how to do consumer hardware and supply chain management worldwide, and they were working on the Courier about the time the iPad hit. Microsoft did nothing with it and the iPad replaced literally millions of low end Windows laptops and netbooks. It took Microsoft something like 3 or 4 years to have an even competitive touch tablet experience with the Surface, and then it bundled desktop Office on a touch device.<p>The iPhone debuted in like 2007 and Microsoft is still peddling a desktop mode Word Processor on a touch tablet as a good idea.<p>The Surface launched without consulting the one team that had shipped tens of millions of hardware devices at Microsoft - the Xbox team and consequently built about 3 million too many Surface RT units which cost the company $900 million in losses.<p>For as much as Microsoft is trying, and they really are trying, Windows and Office are as much of a curse as they are a blessing in the modern era of devices, services, and the cloud. Where they end up is anyone&#x27;s guess, but all the people who seemed to &quot;get it&quot; at Microsoft the last 7 years or so basically got ran out of the company and I have no idea if the people who are still there really &quot;get it&quot; enough to compete with the likes of Samsung, Google, Sony, Amazon, and Apple.<p>Also, remember when Microsoft was so terrified of Google owning search that they tried to buy Yahoo! for $45 billion?

A few people with meager incomes could go in together and rent a warehouse to live in.\n  * London had numerous squats: housing stock so unvalued that it wasn&#x27;t worth stopping people just moving in for free.\nThink about property values in those places today.<p>In the past 60 years we&#x27;ve witnessed a remarkable cycle. First you had the &quot;white flight&quot; to the suburbs starting in the late 1950s or so.  By 1980 the general consensus seemed to be that central cities were doomed forever to poverty.  Now the trend is reversed and people want to pour back in.  However, the regional population is much larger than when this cycle started so central housing has become a scarce resource.<p>The article is mostly about forces particular to the London market though.  It is amazing how high property values have gone there. I live in San Francisco so I think I&#x27;m fairly accustomed to high prices, but visiting London and seeing mews houses going for 3m still blew my mind.  Another peculiarity of the UK market is that a lot of property trading are just leaseholds, so you don&#x27;t even really own the house after you &quot;buy&quot; it.  (There are &quot;freeholds&quot; for sale as well, but that&#x27;s even more expensive)  Lovely city, but it does make you poor.",1381721845

This means that you&#x27;re less likely to move your fingers from the home row and more likely to switch between hands for each letter. Thats the theory of why Dvorak is faster and more comfortable. It&#x27;s a little crazy that E isn&#x27;t on the Qwerty home row.<p>- It was much harder to switch to a new layout than I expected. It took about a month of typing with Dvorak every day and destroyed my ability to type on a qwerty keyboard. For a period during this transition I couldn&#x27;t really type well on either keyboard, not fun, and not easy to explain to my boss why I couldn&#x27;t fucking type. Interestingly I can still type fine on my iphone qwerty keyboard, so it is apparently a separate process in my brain.<p>- I think the article is similar to saying &quot;there&#x27;s no statistical proof that using the metric system is faster&quot;. Using the metric system is the kind of thing that makes sense intuitively, but if you took 100 scientists using imperial measurements and retrained them to use the metric system, it would be hard to conclusively prove that it is _BETTER_.<p>- To extrapolate a little bit, there I think there is a broader point here that statistics are usually used to make an argument, often deceptively. It is incredibly hard to create a clean sample in the real world, and even then its difficult to really extract meaning from those numbers. Remember, the average person has less than 2 legs.<p>- My personal feeling is that Dvorak is a LOT more comfortable and I type maybe 10% faster with it, though I can&#x27;t really back that up. Maybe its just the fact I learned it second, or maybe I&#x27;m just fooling myself, who knows. But I spend like 10 hours a day typing, so if I type 10% faster over my lifetime then I&#x27;ve... turned a profit? Maybe I&#x27;ll spend those extra days at the end of my life doing a better study about how much faster sailors can type on Dvorak.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t use Dvorak, I HIGHLY recommend switching your Escape and Caps-lock keys, especially if you use Vim. Think about how much more you use Escape than Caps-lock. I use something called PCKeyboard Hack to configure that feature and Dvorak on OS X.

So whether you liked math in high school or not has almost no bearing on how good you are at math. Chill.<p>The other fault with the reasoning is that of time-invariance. Math was &quot;tough&quot; for me when I was 8 years old, so it will still be tough for me even though I am an adult now. It takes some level of humbleness to go back to learning something that &quot;kids should know,&quot; but it is totally worth doing. Whether you are a coder, an english major, or a designer, learning a bit of math will give you a lot of extra power to do whatever you do already, and other stuff. For example, learning math will suddenly make half a million more wikipedia pages accessible to you (all the ones with lots of equation blocks). That is a lot of knowledge, and knowledge is power...<p><plug>What if there was a high school math textbook written for adults? A textbook with no BS, which gets directly to the power part right away. What if learning high school math opened the door for you to learn differential calculus (lim,&#x27;(x),max), and integral calculus (dx,a_i) in the same sitting. Then knowing calculus, you would be able to pick up mechanics (F=ma, a(t)=x&#x27;&#x27;(t), p=mv, Ei=Ef, Acos(t+)) quite easily too. All of this in just 383 pages that you can read four weeks if properly caffeinated!</plug>",1381721195

6545215,comment,6544657,6544657,1,0,xargs,,,"The stalemate between teachers vs. administrators vs. students vs. tools/funds is nearly impossible to beat. The lack of tech-literacy (at the most basic level) among teachers is astounding, and the only thing more astounding is the real entrenched/entitled reticence to learn anything new (or that new = bothersome/bad). The overwhelming majority of MS and HS students are far more tech-literate than their teachers, and use that knowledge to learn/research/communicate/create more efficiently and pragmatically than the systems advocated by schools. Worst of all, most teachers don&#x27;t seem to be bothered by the glaring lack of their own tech literacy/learning/implementation, at all?<p>When your teachers can&#x27;t use email, upload content, or use grading software/excel, there&#x27;s a problem. When teachers can&#x27;t figure out how to use iPads, get youtube videos to work, or explain a single practical application of math, science, or engineering at the most basic level, in 2013... there&#x27;s a real crisis.<p>This is one of the major reasons I just left my job, after 8 years in public education. Upon telling my principal I was leaving to pursue programming, she laughed at the impossibility (&quot;That is for like... computer people? There&#x27;s no way you could learn that!? What are you even going to do with that anyway?&quot;).<p>I start an engineering fellowship in the spring, and already can work in Python and HTML/CSS. It wasn&#x27;t that hard to learn, I did it in 3 months. I could&#x27;ve taught it to MS students, easily. I also could&#x27;ve used a program like Chalktips in the classroom or as homework, to encourage graphic design aesthetics while students gained fluency with new/unfamiliar software and [web]searches (I think this is a critical skill), and still accomplish my overall teaching goal for that unit. However, my principal would&#x27;ve been unhappy with the results, purely because they were computer generated (and that&#x27;s not &quot;real&quot; work). So Chalktips, in that way, would&#x27;ve been doomed from the start.<p>I don&#x27;t really know what to say to education startups... the ideas may be fantastic, but the implementation is almost impossible.<p>FWIW, it looked like a solid platform. If I was still in education, I&#x27;d have advocated for it (even if only to be shot down by my superiors and peanut-gallery parents).",1381721023

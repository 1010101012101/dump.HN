At the end of the day all code must be tested, it&#x27;s just a question of whether you are doing it manually or not.

You can hear the click being stable throughout, without any adjustments (ok, it might be .0x off due to slightly different midi timing from Cubase and his gear) - if this weren&#x27;t the tempo/meter, it would drift a lot.<p>The reason for the confusion is probably the sloppy/free live playing in some of the lines. I imagine he had a click track or some quantised line running (like the opening percussion), and played the rest live (even the percussion/string hits in the middle, that sound a bit rushed and sloppy).<p>I think the whole 8ths/16ths etc about how the score should be are irrelevant in electronic music, unless you were to transcribe it for someone to play.</i>",1393919112

It wasn&#x27;t a loss in the long term.<p>Markets like China and India are different wherein enforcement is not that easy.

7338981,comment,7337278,7338922,6,0,illumen,,,"Both good comments :)<p>Another couple of ways to improve your coding...<p>Start with comments outlining what you&#x27;re going to do.  If you are pair programming, this shows the other person what your overall plan is.  It also acts as a mini todo list.  They should be &quot;What comments&quot;.  That is, what does this piece of code do, not how it should be done.  Comments are better than just coding because you can do that quickly as a sketch to show your partner.  Then they don&#x27;t just sit there waiting for you to type out a lot of the algorithm.<p>You can also start doing this with tests first, which help you outline the interface for your object/method/function/module.  This also helps you think about how easy your piece of code is to use by users of your code.  ALotOf. ProgrammersDoNotThinkHowEasyYourFunctionIsToCall(x,a,3).  Is it obvious what it does, and what the required arguments are for the caller?  Is error handling sane for the caller?<p>Coding considering Revision control is very important, and these days acts like great documentation.  With tools like git blame, you can see comments for pieces of code inside the revision control system.  If you limit commits to nice small chunks on one topic at a time this is very helpful for people.  Don&#x27;t include white space fixes with 5 days of changes to 30 files at once, with a comment like &quot;update&quot;.  If they are nicely explained by the revision control comments, and perhaps even reference your issue tracker, then other people reviewing, reading, or bug fixing your code later will have a much easier time.<p>Finally, know when you are in prototype mode, pitch/demo mode, quick script mode, or Serious engineering mode.  Each call for different approaches, and have different requirements.  Don&#x27;t let the Serious engineer get you to do a 10 day development cycle when you have a time limit of 1 day to deliver.  That&#x27;s a fail.  Also, it&#x27;s a fail if you hack something up without following all the development guidelines for some embedded life critical piece of software.",1393918586

Gates and Ballmer are divesting their shares and that means that the new Microsoft has to make Wall Street analysts happy in a way that a company whose CEO and Chairman are the two largest shareholders doesn&#x27;t.<p>The writing was on the wall with Windows 8. It wanted persistent login to Microsoft servers and to produce tailored content via persistent tracking. Whatever doubt I had was gone when Windows 8.1 rolled back my choice of local login without asking and buried the means of changing deeper than before. Topping it off was that 8.1 ignored the fact that the login name I entered as default was the valid local login I had used to start installation.<p>I&#x27;ve been using MS operating systems since DOS 3.3. The first version of Windows I worked with was 2.0 [only for a customized workflow on an Amiga 2000 with bridgeboard, though]. It&#x27;s been Windows full time since 3.0 because I&#x27;ve never felt that Microsoft&#x27;s approach was <i>caveat emptor</i>.<p>Now I can&#x27;t say that.

7338922,comment,7337278,7337934,11,0,swframe,,,"The big thing I learned (at a company where all changes are code reviewed) is to rewrite the code until it seems obviously correct to someone who doesn&#x27;t know what I know. I rename variables, methods and extract code into small methods until someone can read the code out loud and it sounds like a comment.\nfor example:\nif (!thereIsEnoughSpace(user.getDataRequestSize()) {\n    if (canAllocateAdditionalStorage()) {\n        reserveStorageForUser(user, user.getDataRequestSize());\n        ...<p>I&#x27;ve found many bugs after I renamed variables like &#x27;i&#x27;, &#x27;j&#x27;, &#x27;k&#x27;, etc to something more meaningful. That made it easier to realized I was using them incorrectly.<p>This is basically why I think I&#x27;m an ok developer...<p>I pretend to be the smartest developer in my group (let&#x27;s call him Bob). I look at a line of code and ask myself, why will Bob ask me the change this line of code? What will he prevent me from checking in? How would he solve this problem?<p>I do this even if I have a really difficult problem and Bob is the &quot;go to&quot; person. I pretend to be Bob and ask myself, What question will Bob ask me when I tell him about the problem? He will ask me if I&#x27;ve searched google, ok I will search first. He will ask me if I&#x27;ve checked for an upgrade to a library, I will do that. He will ask if I&#x27;ve set a break point here and checked for a memory corruption there. etc. 80% of the time, I find the problem myself and the rest of the time, Bob doesn&#x27;t know the answer either. But at the end of the day co-workers are fooled into thinking that I&#x27;m as good as he is. But I have no doubt that Bob is better because it is important to him to learn everything he can about some key technology. I only approximate Bob when I need to interact with others. If you ask Bob a question, you get a quick and correct response. If you ask me, I will tell you I&#x27;m in the middle of something else and I will get back to you in a few minutes but really I have to figure out the answer first hahaha. I try my best to avoid getting help from Bob because, honestly, I don&#x27;t think Bob respects people who aren&#x27;t as passionate as he is (most people confuse passion with intelligence). The downside, is that it takes me a day to solve a problem that Bob can solve in a few minutes. Managers hate that but it is just too boring to learn technology to the degree that Bob knows it in my free time.",1393916934

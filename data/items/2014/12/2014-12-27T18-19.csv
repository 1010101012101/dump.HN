8803452,comment,8797522,8797522,0,0,galaxyLogic,,,"Here&#x27;s my thoughts about the demise of Smalltalk, if you will. There are of course many reasons, and as said  by others it&#x27;s still alive and well with Pharo.<p>The first reason may be just that it was too good, too ahead of its time. A huge programmer population already existed for C and C++ at the time Java with its C-like syntax came around. In programming languages &quot;incrementalism&quot; rules, which is easy to understand when considering how big an effort it takes to become an expert in one.<p>I think Smalltalk was also a victim of its own success. It promised a huge increase in productivity and software quality. This caused a business-war among its few suppliers at the time (Parc Place, Digitalk) and wars are never good.<p>And there&#x27;s a technical reason for that too. Smalltalk is not just a language, it is an environment with a big library built into it. Even though the class-hierachy was mostly given by the original Smalltalk-80 there were small differences between the vendor-provided libraries which made it hard to run a Smalltalk application written for one Smalltalk virtual machine on another one.  Which made it more important for every Smalltalk vendor to try to tightly own their users.<p>Here again ST was a victim of its own &quot;goodness&quot;. The class-hierarchy is a tightly-knit set of classes which allows for maximum of code-reuse, but also means that it was not easy to combine classes from different platforms. If you took one class from vendor X it meant that many other classes had to follow and those could override similarly named classes in the target environment, which again would break many other things in the target platform and so on.<p>In other words Smalltalk was not modular enough, it was not easy to combine classes written on different platforms with each other. Smalltalk is not only an &quot;island of its own&quot;, every Smalltalk is more or less an island of its own. Then again there&#x27;s still only talk about bringing modularity to Java. But Java has the benefit of non-diverged platform. THAT also almost happened, with &quot;Microsoft Java&quot;.<p>The ability to easily reuse large portions of the Smalltalk platforms is a huge benefit for productivity, at the same time it hinders co-operation between programmers working on different Smalltalk platforms.",1419705714

Then again, the vast majority of his books are also pretty bad compared to his best books.<p>Hollywood has made some great movies out of his short stories (the original Blade Runner, the original Total Recall, The Terminator).  But you have to realize that these movies usually have little to do with the short stories.  The movies are more inspired by them than faithful adaptations of them.<p>This is for two reasons:<p>First, the stories have too little in them to make a movie out of if Hollywood was set on making a faithful adaptation of them.  But this is how they like it, and why they choose the short stories rather than the books.  The diretors and writers want to use a lot of creative license to fill in the gaps and flesh out some core idea that they might find interesting.<p>Second, Hollywood still isn&#x27;t ready to make a faithful adaptation of a Philip K Dick work, because his works rarely fit the Hollywood scifi formula.  They are usually too dark, too depressing, and are rarely full of action, have too much dialogue, and require too much thought on the part of the audience.  Scifi blockbuster material this is not.  Not unless it&#x27;s heavily altered from the originals, like most of the movies based on his stories are.<p>Blade Runner is a notable exception.  But even it is pretty superficial and action-packed compared to the book.  It&#x27;s still a great movie, and (in my opinion) far better than the book.  But it&#x27;s not as faithful as it could be.<p>Regarding your disdain for his books, I can understand it.  They&#x27;re not for everyone.  I happen to like weird books, and I think Dick has points he wants to make when writing them, but you obviously missed them.  And since you missed them, I don&#x27;t blame you for not liking them.  I wouldn&#x27;t have liked them myself if I thought that they were pointless.  But they&#x27;re not.  I could write long essays on the points of each of my favorite PKD books, but I&#x27;ll spare you.<p>I&#x27;ll just say that they are great for people who enjoy reading and thinking about the following themes:<p><pre><code>  - what is reality?
  - what is the purpose of life?
  - what does it mean to be human?
  - is the world as it appears to be?
  - what, if anything, lies beyond the appearance of the world?
  - are non-human or &quot;subhuman&quot; lifeforms less worthy than the fully human or &quot;superior&quot; human beings?
  - what is the role of the mass media in our world?
</code></pre>
Dick is also a great champion of the underdog and has a very strong sense of justice.  In many ways, he is a very moralistic writer, who was deeply influenced by the Holocaust and the Civil Rights struggle in the US.  His works reflect that.<p>He was also deeply interested in mysticism, gnosticism, and philosophy, and is one of the more philosophical science fiction authors I&#x27;ve ever read (as you can probably tell by the many of the themes listed above).  If you are interested in any of those, you&#x27;ll probably like Dick&#x27;s best books.",1419704942

As the article indicates, it is indeed true that there is no method of determining whether a string of numbers that looks random is actually random.  You can tell if it&#x27;s <i>not</i> random through the use of various statistical tests, but there may always be a test that hasn&#x27;t been invented yet that could reveal an underlying pattern.<p>However, distinguishing between quantum randomness and &quot;other&quot; randomness is quite easy actually.  You just ask: did the randomness come from the collapse of a quantum state into an eigenstate of the observable being measured?  (Now, if it&#x27;s already in an eigenstate, it will collapse to the same state, so you have to prepare it in an eigenstate of an incompatible observable before measuring a new observable.)  The particular new eigenstate that it collapses into will be -- according to the postulates of QM -- truly random.<p>So it seems to me that with this &quot;QM random&quot; source from the cell phone sensor, the scientists should be analyzing the &quot;purity&quot; of the signals they are using to generate their numbers.  All kinds of factors could make the results non-QM random: electrical noise, different kinds of light sources, processing delays, etc.  There&#x27;s a lot of things to consider here.<p>(In fact, if you really wanted to be sure that it was QM random, you could create an entanglement [which is a QM-only phenomenon] and then see if the Bell correlations exist between the two entangled states.)",1419704291

8803320,comment,8802969,8802969,0,0,danso,,,"I&#x27;m glad to see the Rolling Stone debacle at the top of this list...to me, it&#x27;s one of the appalling examples of journalistic dysfunction that I can recall off-hand. Yes, I know that the media&#x27;s overall screwup up of the Iraq War was &quot;worse&quot; in many regards...but on the other hand, it was a much more diffuse and broad situation...not only the scope of the topic, but the coverage (within the same publication, different articles had different levels of critique).<p>The RS article, in contrast, involved a pretty simple reporting obstacle: <i>did the main character accurately describe events?</i> Even if she wouldn&#x27;t allow herself to be identified, nor (inexplicably) identify her attackers, there were many ways to circumstantially confirm her story...and RS did none of them. It&#x27;s come out that the RS reporter may have lied about even contacting &quot;Jackie&#x27;s&quot; friends.<p>One reporter&#x27;s lies and incompetence is bad enough...but the fact that her work just passed through RS&#x27;s reportedly legendary fact-checking process, its editors, and its lawyers...is just devastating. The best thing that could come out of this is that Rolling Stone as a journalistic institution falls on its sword and cleans house. At any of the other news outlets I&#x27;ve worked for, even my college paper, I can&#x27;t imagine being able to publish a story like this doing as little verification as the RS reporter did.<p>One of the worst collateral damages from this (aside from the obvious harm to rape victims who now have even more reason to fear publicity) is seeing how easy it is to co-opt the journalistic institution. Few people questioned the RS reporter&#x27;s ethics because <i>Hey, she&#x27;s written several well-regarded stories about rape for Rolling Stone...there&#x27;s no way she&#x27;d have the standards of an intern for this story, right?</i> Even worse were the people (including the reporter herself) who said: <i>&quot;Well, the gang rape victim wasn&#x27;t the story, the story was how U.Va ignored it&quot;</i>...Um yeah, how exactly does U.Va ignore an egregious incident that we don&#x27;t know if the victim actually reported it to U.Va?<p>For my part, when I first read the story, I immediately tweeted/shared it as one of the most compelling stories I read all year. I didn&#x27;t even think to notice the unsaid implication that the reporter never located the accused, nor talked to anyone besides the victim herself...that was my professional bias (i.e. <i>Of course the reporter talked to them and got no comment...that&#x27;s what every reporter is supposed to at least do</i>). But my bias about college fraternities and the problems of rape reporting, and my previous respect for Rolling Stone as a news source, made me accept with little hesitation a story that, in retrospect, was too awful (and perfect in its details) to be true.<p>So the RS U.Va story may not have been the worst journalistic fuckup when it comes to consequences...but it&#x27;s definitely was the worst in terms of showing the flaws in the reporting process, and in how poorly we are able to evaluate the truth behind a story.",1419703819

Nutrition turns out to be a lot more complex than just calories in and calories out. It looks like that is a manifestation of something deeper, like growth hormones triggering a different type of metabolism.<p>He asks the same question about obesity. Do people get fat (elevated number of triglycerides stored in the fat cells) because they are eating more than expending energy? Or, are they eating more because of hormonal imbalances? He (along with many other doctors) suggest that it is actually the effect of insulin that causes the body to be conservative with the expending of energy. Insulin resistance also leads to diabetes, which is strongly correlated with obesity. So the hypothesis is that it is out of control insulin (due to sugar intake, HFCS, simple carbs, prevelant in american diet) that is the <i>cause</i> for the obesity epidemic, and not just less exercise (although exercise can be used to eliminate the excess glucose in the body which triggers the insulin response).<p>Here are some of his talks:<p>TED: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMhLBPPtlrY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMhLBPPtlrY</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAWdHYSrh7M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAWdHYSrh7M</a><p>And his blog<p><a href=""http://eatingacademy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eatingacademy.com/</a>",1419703755

While I consider myself to be a good coder (and people tell me so), I don't consider myself to be a top-notch guru ninja coder. I also don't have a CS degree, and I tend to get a little lost when people start getting into CS theory.<p>2) I have a (probably irrational) aversion to working at really big companies, I think probably due to my time dealing with insane bureaucracy in the Navy.

If you will spend a couple hours learning the language (maybe a couple days) you'll start to appreciate the syntax and it will no longer be a problem.<p>Erlang is not as fast as bare metal languages like, say, C, but Erlang is fantastic for making programs in parallel and executing them on multiple cores or nodes or clusters of nodes with multiple cores.<p>I guess I should take the occurrence of these kinds of articles as a sign that Erlang is getting wider acceptance.

You simply cannot tell how it will fit on your body without trying it on. You need to see it and put it on.<p>- Quality of construction. This includes the feel of the fabric, the way the pieces are sewn together, what shapes were chosen for each piece, and even things like if the patterns line up at the seams. You have to see these things in person to decide.<p>Having said that, most men probably aren't as picky about their clothes as I am (Most women I know are more so) and there may be a market for online shopping for those men who aren't.

But then, that's no central authority anymore and who's to say that you can still trust the content on said websites?<p>I mean think about it - an evildoer government could very well continue to host the same website, with modified content, with a new (valid) security certificate.<p>And then, the means for distributing said IP are either (a) commercial companies that have to obey the law of their government, like Google or Twitter or (b) insignificant forums that won't make the news if taken down themselves.<p>Yes, you cannot block information for the technically inclined, but you can block it for 90% of the population effectively and I think China sets a powerful precedent here. Not only that, but timing is very important. Sometimes censorship is very relevant to the current world affairs, not having the same impact one month later.<p>I think the Internet is more sensitive to censorship than people care to admit.",1309807503

It didn't allow me to download my information, it said I should receive an email when I can (it's ""gathering"") and after 25 minutes the email hasn't been sent. Honestly, even if the zip has exactly what I want in it, that is an unacceptable experience.<p>I created a yahoo account just so I could link it to my facebook account and export the contacts from yahoo. If linking to a third party and exporting from there is more straightforward than exporting the data directly there is something seriously wrong.<p>Secondly, I only want my contact information, why can I not get just it? If I was on a limited bandwidth connection or I had to pay per byte in particular it is completely absurd that I have to download everything that I don't care about to get what I do care about.<p>There is also the point that the facebook experience feels adversarial for some things. Sure they had almost exactly the same feature as Circles for a long time, but how many people ever used it? When I was using it it feels more like some VP at facebook was like ""I guess we <i>have</i> to include this feature, but it will hurt our bottom line if too many people start using it so we should make it sufficiently complex and buried that no one uses it while still being available so that if anyone complains about the lack of security features we can point at the fact that it technically exists"". Exporting data seems to have followed exactly the same line of thinking.<p>My last comment I will be unable to actually confirm until I am able to see what they are exporting, but if it is not in a format that I can import to gmail contacts (it supports several formats from major vendors) then it is worse than useless to me since it made me waste all this time to get something that isn't in a usable format.

Libya has a much smaller population (less than 1/3rd of Syria's), and Gaddafi's army is much smaller and less well armed than Assad's. More importantly Syria is known to have stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, especially mustard and nerve gas.<p>If we were to set up a list of brutal dictatorships based on the order of which are most deserving of being toppled then likely North Korea would be on the top, perhaps even above Libya right now. However, the cost and sacrifice (in civilian lives as well) of such actions must be taken into account, and for both North Korea and Syria it's highly questionable whether that math adds up. We could overthrow North Korea or Libya's government if we desired.

American exceptionalism, even less. I wore the ""cloth of our nation"" for many years, before, perhaps, some readers of HN were even born. (It's possible!) While I believe that American ideals strive to capture the very highest potential of civilization, my disillusionment is total.<p>I spent a long time in Iraq, and I was part of the federal Hurricane Katrina response immediately after the levees broke. I was a fervent George Bush supporter & believer until I saw what happened in New Orleans, and was a strong opponent after my second Iraq tour.<p>What little faith I had in our elected leaders has been methodically sought out and destroyed by Obama's term in office. The vigor with which politicians will consume each other to the detriment of national interests is... heartbreaking. I foolishly afforded myself a little of ""that hope-y, change-y stuff"", but our president's ineffectiveness -- either because of his own doing or the resistance in Washington -- has made me regret that.<p>And now, we have Sarah Palins and Michelle Bachmanns running around belittling science, undermining factual rightness, and generally spitting in the face of honesty.

But if there were a compelling alternative, I would switch in a heartbeat.<p>Important things for the experience (based on my complaints about the process):<p>- Make it easy to try lots of brands, even if you charge a little bit to do so.  I would gladly spend a very small amount of money on a week's supply or a few day's supply of a brand so I could try it.<p>- Have a more user-driven recommendation scheme (like netflix, but doesnt have to be so advanced) -- maybe you could even figure out most commonly used combinations ...<p>- Remember the last products I ordered, and allow me to indicate if they were good or bad.  I dont want to accidentally buy a deodorant I hated and I definitely don't want to have to remember what products I'm using now.<p>- Quick-order flight-friendly bottle pack.

Clients often want media clips from the TV shows they were featured in. So you need a database of TV clips.<p>There's a government body in Canada that handles a bunch of aspects of Canada's copyright system. They set tariffs and rules for doing various things. They've set the tariffs for media monitoring and also set the rules that you have to follow in order to run a media monitoring service. One of them is that you can't have a database that has video with a resolution greater than 320x240 and it also can't have a frame rate greater than 15 frames per second.<p>Obviously this isn't legal advice... There appear to be a lot of rules to follow. This looks to be one of them. Consult a lawyer to find out how complicated this really is...",1309806245

How can you justify buying Altiris when you own SCCM via the Core CAL? Ditto for AV, although the MS solution is not that great. How do you justify some enterprise monitoring suite for some wacky prcice when you license system center for $2k per VM host?<p>People who think they are disrupting spending in the enterprise on on crack. You're in an era of belt-tightening, and the belt gets tighter every time there's a ""fiscal cliff"" or some other looming nightmare. My director circa 2003 could drop $500k with a few days notice. Now, the procurement people watch any purchase like a hawk -- some places want ROI calculations on toner!<p>Salesforce is a another great example. I met them last week, they very much looked and sounded like enterprise sales folk. The only thing ""radical"" about them is that they are competing against other software vendors AND your incumbent hardware and data center / network providers. If you buy Siebel, you need to deal with Oracle's bullshit for the software and the services to make it work, AND you need to land infrastructure to run it at full capacity on day 1.<p>These changes are radical in that they make procuring and getting value easier, and lower the probability of seven figure shelf ware.

""Newly founded companies are mostly financed by the founders' own funds""<p>Ah the typical European startup dilemma. The governments recognize that in an age of difficult unemployment and stagnating growth, new avenues of entrepreneurship need to be embraced, and so they set up all sorts of programs to encourage new startups. But then these startups get beyond the very early stage, and need to raise capital to continue their growth. And the look to institutional money in Europe. And no one will give them any. Because the European investor mindset is so risk averse, that only those who already have money are considered safe enough to start real businesses (continuing the old guard).<p>Personally, I think that's great. You folks in Europe are just reasserting that we in the US have the more opportune climate for startups. And so we'll continue to steal all your good ones ;)",1359870794

You're right with the idea that it is advantageous to be separated from the motorcycle in a crash. Not just due to not wanting to be dragged along however.<p>When I started riding a motorcycle several years back I took a proper safety and rider training course. One of the strategies that could be employed for an imminent crash was literally referred to as a ""Superman Dive"". Basically, you see you're about to hit a car/truck so you put your feet on the footpegs, hands on the gas tank and jump over the vehicle you're about to hit and then do your best to roll when you hit the ground on the other side. A seatbelt would naturally prevent this.<p>While hitting the ground on the other side of the vehicle and then going for a roll is far from a good day, it beats going from whatever-speed-you're-at to zero instantly when you're flung into the other vehicle. Since there is no metal box around you on a motorcycle, rather than be a safety feature, a seatbelt would limit or prevent actions that could seriously reduce the chances and severity of injuries.",1359870699

5158801,comment,5157760,5158570,1,0,lutusp,,,"> How do philosophers and scientists react to Godel's incompleteness theorem w.r.t. falsification?<p>I can't speak for philosophers, but as to scientists, the issue of falsification and irreducible uncertainty are separate in nearly all cases. Remember that the Incompleteness Theorems address true assertions that cannot be proven within reasonably complex axiomatic systems -- that's a fair remove from empirical science, just as mathematics is.<p>> To me, at least, it seems to suggest that falsification is a flashlight that for whatever reason fails to illuminate certain otherwise possible paths.<p>Not at all. Falsification is a very reliable test that can be used to eliminate theoretical assertions from any further consideration, as in the classic ""black swan"" example already given above. It's unambiguous.<p>> It's interesting that the emergent properties of the pursuit of falsification bring about a paradoxical system in the limit.<p>No, neither paradoxical nor ambiguous. A classic falsification has properties that eliminate theories from consideration, period, full stop. Examples abound -- the Ptolemaic system, the ether theory, phlogiston, and so forth.",1359870438

For example, in Massachusetts, on roadways under MassHighway (well, now known as the MassHighway division of MassDOT) jurisdiction, speeds are supposed to be ""reasonable and proper"" (MGL Chapter 90, Section 17). Exceedance of posted speed limits are ""prima facie"" evidence of speeding, but not conclusive evidence, so it's technically possible to exceed the posted speed limit but not break the law if you can demonstrate that your speed is ""reasonable and proper"" (of course if you're not a lawyer or someone willing to spend a lot of money, this argument is not likely to fly in front of a magistrate). The MassPike and MassDCR roads require strict adherence to posted limits.<p>There are several other states that use ""reasonable and proper"" similar to MA, but I'd have to look them up to give a list.

Although I do also believe that they are probably more intrinsically likely to lie. Why? I think you're right that of the non-police population, many would lie if they became cops due to the extrinsic incentives to lie. At the same time though, people who aren't comfortable lying about their current/past drug use are effectively banned from becoming cops. So while the study might not prove that cops are more intrinsically likely to lie per se, the fact that there is a significant disparity suggests to me that it's highly likely that part of that disparity is due to differences in who decides to be a cop. And, if it is the case that some significant portion of that disparity is due to selection factors, which seems likely, then my it would be accurate to say that they are intrinsically more likely to lie.",1359868516

Many of the largest companies you can think of are ""old school"". Traditional enterprise sales is high touch relationship building with millions of dollars at stake. And it isn't the cold call BS boiler room stuff that people think of when they think of enterprise sales.<p>The best enterprise salespeople become great friends with their potential clients. They know what schools their clients' kids are going to, where they went on vacation, and who they need to introduce them to. They know when a client's birthday is and which restaurant she's eating at to call and pick up the tab. They know how a client takes their coffee and what their favorite drink is. They show up with hard to get theater or game tickets. They're sincerely invested in the success of the client. The client isn't a ""mark"" to them. Clients are friends and you'd never do anything to hurt your friend. In many ways, a great enterprise salesperson becomes the advocate for your customers inside your company, pushing you to create a better product because they never want to let their friends down. Great enterprise salespeople know how to ask for money because they understand the value they're delivering and also when to comp something. They know how to say sorry and they know how to keep a valuable customer.<p>The fact is that this kind of selling is hard to scale. However, it's worth it at less scale because the account sizes are usually quite large. Your best enterprise salesperson is like a Zappos account rep on steroids. Clients feel great and they give you the chance to build a product that they love and recommend to other large account holders.<p>This isn't for everyone. You should probably be in a market where you can make $100,000 per year from a client (you'll probably be making the client $500k+ per year and you'll need a product that lots of clients need) to employ an ""old school"" strategy. And it should be said that there are bad enterprise sales people. They'll abuse your clients, make you develop the wrong features, and some won't sell a damn thing because they're better at selling themselves than they are at serving clients.<p>Great old school enterprise salespeople combined with a top-notch product is a killer combo. If you find a few techniques that help you sell more, that's great. Just don't be in a hurry to avoid building a real relationship with valuable enterprise clients. If you're easy to switch to, you're easy to switch from.",1359868416

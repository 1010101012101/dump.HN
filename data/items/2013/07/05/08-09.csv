Governance bodies may take public comments, but for the ceremony and to legitimize the process; they ignore them, and vote as if they never took place.  I&#x27;ve seen the same elsewhere, such as at the Menlo Park City School District meeting: they take comments, ignore them, then vote how they intended to vote prior to the public discussion.  But think how hard it is to process creative discussion on your feet, particularly when arguments arise that repudiate your position, and you have no way to validate the new arguments or to research them prior to the vote.  Whom do you trust?  What should you do?  It is the process that is broken: votes should not happen immediately after the comment period, but after a period of evaluation of the comments; and then the governance body should have to repudiate the comments or at least to reply to them.",1373014612

I don&#x27;t think the British version of the word carries the same kind of social condescension that it does in Japan.</i><p>Agreed. But that doesn&#x27;t change the origins of the word - it just highlights the cultural (mis)representation of the term.<p><i>> Also Hikikkomori means that you literally don&#x27;t leave your room at all (which is not the case for a NEET). If the hermit needs something, they&#x27;ll often bang the floor to summon their mother (typically for food)</i><p>To be fair, Hikikkomori and NEET aren&#x27;t meant to refer to the same people anyway. It just so happens there&#x27;s overlap in the context. An example in western culture could be &quot;freeloaders&quot; and &quot;unemployed&quot;. The former has negative connotations (ie they live of others like leaches) where as the latter just states they don&#x27;t have a job. While some who are unemployed could be classed as freeloaders, it&#x27;s also fair to say that some who are unemployed are very keen to find work and support themselves. So there&#x27;s overlap in the people covered by those two terms but they don&#x27;t automatically refer to the same group of people.",1373014562

Japan is first hit because of the strong disparities between generations. Truth is, the internet brought about a lot of things so one could have a constant &quot;window out&quot; from a single room. Most of us know precisely what I am talking about.<p>I would like to theorize that this is only one of the things that facilitate such isolation by making it more tolerable. What pushes people IN is the social reflection. Misfits often get shunned for being different. Tack all that on top of the social networks and the compound strength can be overwhelming: \nThis generation is the first generation EVER to get to observe first-hand how their failure compares to their 5th grade friend Jimbo, who&#x27;s now a doctor. And Suzan has had 2 kids. Meanwhile Jack constantly posts pictures of his new cars on sites X,Y,Z. That doesn&#x27;t help your self esteem when you see everyone happy and you&#x27;re lonely. \nBack in the days, your dad might have messed up for 3 years, but the stigma never stuck because (1) people did not have proof from the network itself and (2) he was able to &quot;snap out of it&quot; because he wasn&#x27;t constantly reminded of others great lives (and by comparison how miserable he was) - those things would get ushered behind the blinds of hearsay,  they&#x27;d be on the very periphery of your life. But now all of those haunt you, via Facebook feed and other social medias, where subconsciously we mostly try to advertise our successes. \nI think it is time for psychiatry to wake up to this. I fear it will take another 50-100 years for this to be understood.<p>I wish the world would wake up and realize that WE as a society are malfunctioning and that the burden to support each-others falls on all.",1373013164

When regular people experience anxiety reduction in conjunction with exercise, the belief in exercise as the cause is unquestioned, and researchers like these in the article need never fear that their interpretation will be scrutinized. Nobody has a vested interest in opposing exercise. Everyone knows it&#x27;s just plain good for you.<p>What did this study prove? The assertion is that mice that are locked in cages so they forcibly can&#x27;t do what they would normally be doing make good representatives for people that are not exercising, for any reason, including personal preference. Do the researchers actually find that convincing? No, apparently not:<p>>> Of course, as we all know, mice are not men or women. But, Dr. Gould says, other studies show that physical exercise reduces anxiety in humans, suggesting that similar remodeling takes place in the brains of people who work out.<p>In other words, this study didn&#x27;t really need to prove anything, anyway, because it&#x27;s already known from &quot;other studies.&quot;<p>If you were going to design the definitive study to answer the question of whether exercise relieves anxiety, how would you control for the placebo effect? You can make sugar pills that are, plausibly, convincing enough to separate drug effect from placebo. But how do you make a placebo for exercise? Exercise itself would seem like the perfect placebo. If a research study was able to motivate a group of sedentary, depressed subjects to start regular exercise, it would seem to make it very hard to argue that those subjects didn&#x27;t believe they were genuinely doing something. A rigorous, double-blind, controlled study of exercise sounds all but fundamentally impossible to do.<p>What about an observational study? How do you take two people, one who exercises regularly, and one who is sedentary, and claim that they are otherwise perfectly matched?<p>Why are scientists so sure it&#x27;s been proven? Nature abhors a vacuum. It seems like the less testable something is, the more certain people are of it.",1373012402

I think most good developer would rather work for Google or their own company than work for Yahoo. Since mooching top developers from Google is out of the question, acqui-hiring seems to be the next best option.<p>- You can&#x27;t play with 500k/yr strategy because they are other top companies with deeper pocket and can throw more money at employees than yahoo, also because it creates a bad precedent, where current employees who might be more talented but getting 1/5th of the pay. It also artificially increases values of developers IMO.<p>- Getting acqui-hired employees from small companies/start-ups means hiring people who used to working under pressure and delivering/shipping. This might not always be the case for Yahoo current group of people. People from outside the eco-chamber might help them change the working culture.<p>- They had to pay that amount, doesn&#x27;t mean thats how much they value they employees, it also means thats how much they had to pay the investors in order to get employees to work for them.",1373011539

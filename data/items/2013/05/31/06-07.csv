I see that people here in India somehow expect a lot of things to come for free, I've had serious problems receiving payments. Not just freelancing and doing projects on the side but even big companies have this attitude of considering offering an employment as doing a favor. And this attitude is something deeply ingrained in our culture. A bit part of this is because even until recently, being rich was all about cheating some way. Jobs were all about working for a land lord in some fields, or having a small time shop selling groceries or at most stuff like shoes, or clothes. The only way out was two areas engineering and medicine. For a long time and to a very great extent now those were the only two areas where you could make big money as some one from middle class.<p>There fore when it comes to a definition of a job. People still tend to think of those lifelong employment at some government set up or at most a factory worker.<p>In India most people have a difficult time understanding money can be made non-linear to the efforts spent. We are still stuck in the idea you get paid x rs/hour or y rs/month.<p>And if that is not enough we have some kind of enjoyment in making glory out of poverty. Rich = evil, poor = godly. More worse, if you are rich or trying to get rich, People throw in this 'happiness doesn't come from money' card. Every other attempt is made to keep a person in a constant state of mediocrity. People who try to break out of this vicious cycle are automatically termed as 'greedy' and 'selfish', In other words if you promise to stay poor as them, all is fine. Silently they tell you - 'How dare you try to be different than us?'<p>Some people are just plain afraid, they or there parents spend a lot of effort getting somewhere in life. And they don't just want to throw away all that by failing doing start ups. Some are afraid of ridicule. Some are just lazy.<p>It will take some time to break these assumption/rules about living life.<p>Regardless of this, many Indians now realize all this are making a lot progress. Much wealth can be created as genuine competition is practically non existent.",1369981890

5797218,comment,5796539,5797076,2,0,btilly,,,"First of all a note.  I've made a substantial fraction of my living over the last decade from my understanding of statistics.  When I look at a projected statistical range of 1.0-3.0 that later got refined to 0.9-2.0 I see that as a fit.  Sure, the bottom end of the new range moved out of the bottom end of the old range.  But if you watch an A/B test run, you'll see that this is entirely expected.  But the median prediction of the new range - the most likely outcome - is 1.55 which is (assuming that the original range was a 95% confidence interval) is inside of 1 standard deviation of the prediction.<p>Secondly when you say that the <i>warming is insufficient to create the run-away warming predicted in climate models</i> you're in disagreement with the vast majority of people who have actually tried to run the numbers.  Having just seen you draw an incorrect ""not a fit to the statistics"" from something that I know very well looks exactly in line with what I'd expect a fit to look like, I'm going to trust that scientists understand their own numbers better than you understand them.<p>Thirdly your claim that the new historical record has 10-20 years of no statistically significant warming is just plain false.  The article this discussion started about finds that if you just use data from the last decade and project that forward you get an average projection of increasing 1.55C in a period that previous models had said would increase 1-3C.  That doesn't look to me like you're not warming.<p>And finally I'm glad that scientists don't let their models sit still for decades.  It is a fact that the models have huge error bars.  I want them to improve the models, to bring them down.  And the fact that the new models are in good statistical agreement with the old is confirmation that the old models were reasonable (if less accurate than desired).  Until we see a statistical lack of fit between old and new data (which has yet to happen) - there is no statistical reason to doubt the science.<p>In the meantime I'm concerned that the 10 years with the least arctic ice in the summer all happened in the last 10 years.  You may dismiss that data point.  But in all of the discussions about newly available oil drilling locations and transport routes, it is worth noting that it is a very visible sign of a major global phenomena.<p>BTW if you want to dig farther, I recommend <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL048794/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL048794/abst...</a> for a detailed energy budget of where heat appears to be going right now.",1369981708

The sheath has electromagnets inside of it to accelerates the cable. The motion of the cable would cause the loop to curve and raise into the sky.<p>To outside observers, it would look like a giant version of the St. Louis arch with the peak nearly in low earth orbit, but only a few inches thick. The magic comes with the fact that the iron cable can be used for travel by using electromagnetic attraction to the iron cable through the sheath.<p>What's interesting is that while there are several engineering challenges, unlike a space elevator, this wouldn't require any materials technologies that don't already exist today. The iron cable could be made by existing forges that make the cabling for bridges, and the electromagnetic sheath could borrow a lot of existing technologies from the hard drive manufacturing industry.<p>It would also fit with his previous work on Space X and Solar Cities to some extent.<p>A launch loop can be used to transport cargo or passengers high enough that the energy required to get them into orbit is very inexpensive, which ties into his Space X work.<p>The external sheath of the Launch Loop could have solar panels on it to power the electromagnets that help keep the loop in motion, and even when the sun goes down, millions of tons of iron spinning like a flywheel has enough kinetic energy to keep going until the sun rises again.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if he ran across the concept when he was researching ways to get into space before he founded Space X, and it's his ""Step 2"".<p>Lastly, if you had a giant cable stretched across the sky that worked kind of like a bicycle brake cable in its sheath, but the cable was running through the system at 30k mph in a giant loop, what better name than Hyperloop?

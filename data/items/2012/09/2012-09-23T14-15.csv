Because every county has its own transit agency, a trip that spans multiple counties requires either taking BART or Caltrain, or transferring buses each time you cross a county line.  And of course, for trips to SV BART isn't an option, so your choice is Caltrain which runs infrequently (even during commute hours the frequency is pretty low) or a terrible set of bus routes.  Consolidating all of the transit agencies (under the auspices of the MTC or something else) would be an excellent step towards building a more useful transit network.",1348411694

Put OSX, Windows, or Linux on it, whatever you want, it's still extremely well made hardware and will be durable, usable, and hold resale value better.

The problem in the first place is that this is an insanely hard problem that is in the centre of Google's core competencies (data gathering, search, data munching; all on a ridiculously massive scale).  Apple makes  hardware and an operating system and some apps for it. Where in that set of core competencies does it indicate they have what it takes to tackle this and yield the quality google has (who have poured a rather large fortune into it (they bought the satellites for google maps so they could reshoot to avoid clouds), the have paid for high tech trucks to run down every road in an increasingly large collection of cities. And then massive human QA teams)<p>This isn't what apple does and it was massive hubris on their part to think they could tackle this and come anywhere near the level of google maps, or their usual standard of excellence. I remain extremely dubious that there is any ""quick"" fix to their problem. It's not like the screwed up an algorithm and this is a bug, this is a massive problem that they've barely started to tackle.<p>If Apple does realize what it's going to take to compete at this and doubles down on it, it's still going to take a year or two for them to catch up. And that's an if. So Apple Maps/iOS5 combo is a write off. Probably iOS6 too.  You want  good mapping the next few years, stick with google. Maybe after that Apple will have something worth looking at, just as likely maybe not.",1348410816

4561005,comment,4560691,4560691,14,0,saurik,,,"Despite spending a lot of time both in the design Wiki and in the talk discussing the importance of being able to determine whether a / indicates a regular expression literal or a division operator entirely within the lexer (as opposed to using the parser, which is how JavaScript is generally defined), the algorithm that this developer implemented does not actually work.<p>First off, an example where it works:<p><pre><code>    a
    /5/
    7
</code></pre>
If you run this through sjs you get:<p><pre><code>    a / 5 / 7;
</code></pre>
This is because, in JavaScript, statements continue across line boundaries until they are either explicitly terminated by a semicolon or a syntax error, in which case the parse is retried at that point as if a semicolon had been provided. In this case, that means we have a single statement that is a division of these three expressions: a, 5, and 7.<p>However, let's take a more difficult case:<p><pre><code>    a = function() {}
    /5/
    7
</code></pre>
This is also a single statement: you are entirely allowed to attempt to divide a function literal by a number, you will simply get the value NaN as output. If you take this file and run it through node, adding a ""console.log(a)"" to the end, that is in fact what you will get: NaN. However, when first run through sjs, you instead get ""[Function]"".<p>The reason is that sjs translated the code to:<p><pre><code>    a = function () {
    };
    /5/;
    7;
</code></pre>
This is incorrect, and demonstrates how difficult some of these underlying issues are when parsing languages that have intertwined lexer and parser state. :( Attempting some other test cases involving regular expressions (but not semicolon insertion) also failed: it seems a lot more work will need to be done on this before it will be able to process general input (and it is not 100% clear to me that the shortcut required is even possible: I haven't thought enough about it yet to say for certain, however).<p>(I work on the JavaScript parser for a compile-to-JS language used by people doing jailbroken-iOS development for live introspection of running processes, and thereby that was the first thing I was interested in: how well the parser worked. ;P I have intentions to add reader macros, and then replace all of the extra Objective-C syntax I added with them, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. FWIW: I actually found and fixed a bug in my parser while writing this comment. ;P)",1348410598

They will <i>love</i> this feature, because it will allow them to customize which external and internal online sources employees will be able to search, and then they will be able to track all employee searches.<p>* Regular people -- that is, the kind of people who don't even know about HN.  These people will also <i>love</i> non-local search in the Dash.  They already search for everything on Google, buy everything through Amazon, and readily hand over all their intimate, personal information to FaceBook... without ever giving their own privacy a second thought.<p>* Power users who're aware of the privacy issues involved.  Virtually everyone in this market segment, including me, feels strongly that non-local search should be offered only as an opt-in feature, if at all.<p>Viewed in this light, Canonical's decision to implement non-local search can at least be understood: they're trying to make their customers happy, but they've unintentionally pissed off the smallest of the three market segments above: power users.  (Sorry for the harsh language; I can think of no better way to convey how a lot of Ubuntu power users feel about this.)  Alas, power users may be the smallest of the three market segments above, but they have disproportionate influence over the other two.  Disregarding the concerns of power users may not be a good idea in the long run.<p>In retrospect, Canonical could have -- indeed, should have -- handled the announcement of this feature much better.

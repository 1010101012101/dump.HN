If you die, what happens to your gmail account? By extension, what happens to all your electronic accounts? Normal physical property is handled in probate court, which sorts out your will (if you have one) and the next of kin, etc, etc.<p>These days more and more of our ""property"" is digital, what happens to your flickr account or your blog? These could have been a big part of your life when you were alive....<p>A related question is: What <i>should</i> happen to your digital property? I'm not sure I want my gmail account to be given to anybody?",1226310332

The last part is important, if they did work there would be a non-spam market for them.<p>For this reason, I believe that we do not see hair loss products marketed extensively through spam.

I've had this for all my life it seems. How did I deal with it?

359067,comment,359041,359041,0,0,neilk,,,"You're lucky to be a hacker. There's almost no other profession more suited to unusual sleep schedules. The place where you were working sounds very anti-hacker. You'll have to find a better place. It will not be as hard as you think, just be up-front about your condition.<p>I have a co-worker who prefers to work on a 28-hour schedule. (I don't think he has a sleep disorder, he just decided he liked it.) His office hours are unpredictable, but he gets his work done and nobody cares.<p>There's even another team on this floor that's adopted a ""results-only"" management style, which means that people are discouraged from insisting on things like office hours. Those people are practically never even in the office.<p>I don't think it's absolutely required that you be a contractor, and in lots of places contractors have even less leverage than regular employees in defining the terms of their work. But if you go this route it's not particularly hard either. Just say you are one, print business cards, get a job in the normal way, and then cash their checks. Maintain your own computer equipment and count the depreciation as an expense. Charge more than you would make in wages to make up for the lack of job security. You don't even need to incorporate, or even talk to a lawyer, although this is sometimes advantageous once you're really raking it in.<p>If you happened to be offshore, your sleep disorder might even be an advantage, since every few weeks you'd be in sync with headquarters. I assume you are in the USA? Maybe you should consider moving to Australia or something.<p>P.S. It sounds like you've managed before? Management of offshore operations is one of those things that corporations constantly struggle with. So if you were cycling in and out of both time zones, that might be a real advantage.",1226309800

Which you acknowledge, which is why is's a good answer.<p>You are right that most of the time that's enough. But I disagree about the fact the edge cases don't matter.<p>They matter because they happen, and they happen a lot.<p>You can not just ignore them - you have to pick something.<p>And people do, and other people argue, and ultimately the person with the most power (or numbers) wins.<p>And then of course you have lot of yelling, like right now in california. People are very happy with the democratic process - until they loose.<p>And since I'm talking about it - that's not an issue of allowing people to do what they want. It's an issue of forcing other to recognize something they don't want to. That's one of your edge cases - can you do that? Can you go against someones will and make them do something because you think it's better?<p>A few decades ago black-white marriage went through the same process and said ""allow it"", but this time we get a different result. It seems pretty random to me. Which is what I expect because there is no guiding principle you can look to.<p>Anyway, getting back on topic.<p>You always have to ""break others consent"" - I don't want trucks driving by my house, the gov says they may. You just broke my consent.<p>I don't want to go into quarantine - but I have to. Again - one of those edge cases when you have to balance the consent of multiple people.<p>They happen a lot. I can understand saying ""I don't know"" - but you can not call your code complete without them.",1226309306

359059,comment,358958,358958,0,0,mixmax,,,"Coverage of economic issues is shallow at best in most media. The reasons for this are probably a combination of factors:<p>- Economy is hard and the fact that not even economists agree on cause and effect, predictions, indicators, etc. doesn't exactly make it easy being a journalist faced with the task of writing about it.<p>- The medias sources all have more or less obvious interests. When you interview a banker or a stock broker he will have an agenda, and often want to talk the market up or down. The media should rely more on academic sources that are presumably less biased.<p>- Economic issues don't lend themselves to being explained in a one column article digestible by normal media consumers. It's a difficult subject full of intricate dependencies and difficult words.<p>These things mean that most journalist go pretty lightly on the economic coverage and are easily influenced by banks, brokerage houses and other actors that have an interest in setting an agenda. And I think it's a huge problem.",1226308642

A .zip file full of .pngs isn't going to be much smaller than the .pngs themselves.<p>Also, as far as I can tell, you didn't really purchase anything ""from Broderbund."" Broderbund is now just a brand for Ubisoft to release titles under; your e-commerce terror is likely repeatable with any of Ubisoft's products.",1226308566

I've used it before in religion arguments, both in defending religion against people who think it could be easily disposed of, and in arguing why religion's affecting society isn't the same thing as proof of a god's existence.<p>Unrelated: why WERE there so many atheism posts today?

The only reason you think it's OK is that you live in a culture where that is the norm. Live somewhere else and you'd think something else.<p>In neither case can you point me to universal principles that would help you decide. I'm not looking for the answer, I'm looking for how to pick the answer.<p>""If they're ten random people that some madman ordered you to murder for his own reasons, at the cost of your own life if you do not, then morality cannot apply here. There can be no right and wrong in the case of someone who is acting under coercion.""<p>Yes, 10 random people. You say morality cannot apply - yet you have to make a choice: do you kill them or don't you? Which do you choose? And more importantly how do you decide which to choose?<p>""no"" to killing someone not harming you to keep yourself alive:<p>You said no. But thousands upon thousands of people throughout history chose different. Some people would hold that keeping yourself alive is your utmost responsibility, and trumps anything else. Even today people are not that troubled by killing someone outside their group.<p>I don't agree - but I can not prove it beyond saying that probably civilization would do better that way - but even that is not necessarily so. Some civilizations are based on strength of arm (and your allies arms). Those might do better then one not based on such - look at Tibet.<p>Both of the choices you listed match those of american norms and those of the bible (which is where they originated).<p>""I'm not so bored as to write about it in detail""<p>But that was the entire question - the examples listed don't need an answer, they are just a point to example how two people might come up with totally different logical answers.<p>I'm not going to read Atlas Shrugged - I had enough with philosophical books disguised as novels when I read The Sword of Truth series (it started great, then got horrible) - and it's based on Ayn's works.<p>But, I read a wikipedia summary, and I know for sure that many disagree with her. If she can really come up with a morality from first principles - how can you disagree?<p>I say you can't. You either pick randomly, or you let someone above you pick. Most people do the second - they do what they grew up with, and their parents did the same, etc, if you go back, for almost the entire world it's ultimately based on the ideas of the bible.",1226308310

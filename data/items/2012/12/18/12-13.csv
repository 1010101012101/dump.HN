4937241,comment,4934855,4936284,2,0,dalke,,,"That assumes that there are no other forces. Your solution doesn't handle momentum changes (throwing an object, or taking a bullet, or being close to an explosion) while in the air, and it assumes that there's no maximum or terminal velocity in the game. It also becomes trickier to compute when your objects hit other objects.<p>You say that ""you will need to update the initial [state vector] whenever the jump is interrupted or modified"" - that's exactly what numerical integration does. So your solution seems like it would use a closed-form solution for some cases, and numerical integration for others, which would make the dynamics code easily twice as complicated.<p>While switching from Euler to leapfrog integration is a couple of lines of change, for a better approximation.",1355835529

Although I've lived in a few large cities with decent job markets, I settled here for reasons of personal choice and sanity. Like the author of this piece, I'm utterly unwilling to move (I'd sooner change professions; I'll be a USCG licensed boat captain soon). I understand the tradeoffs involved, and I work in a partnership of like-minded individuals around the country. The partnership gives us healthcare and retirement benefits, while the senior partner in LA has physical access to a large job market to keep us stocked with contracts, if we need more work.<p>Yes, there are tradeoffs. I probably won't advance in your company or have a prestigious resume, even though I've been working on Internet technologies since the early 1990s. I don't want to be a founder or first employee, I want to be your first contractor. You can even meet me, too; I've been known to fly out to conferences and company meetings.<p>For my part, I use the partnership's Redmine ticket system religiously, and the customer can see the solid results I deliver by working for the agreed-upon amount of hours (or more!) per day/week/month, and if the customer doesn't like the results (experience suggests most do, but some are better suited to cheap stuff from India), then they do not renew the contract.<p>Besides my zipcode, I get an interesting choice of working situations. I've been on conference calls while I had two divers in the water getting lobster. A week ago, my office was on the tailgate of the truck as my wife and I worked blue crab fishing holes. I may even be on the sailboat moored near a coral patch reef, a few miles out to sea (there is LTE up to 5nm out to sea generally, around here). I don't tell all clients about this; Some are cool with it, others would prefer to think I sit in an office all day. It doesn't matter, because in the end I'm serious about productivity, regardless of my surroundings (and this is why you won't generally find me trying to work from the countless bars down here, experience suggests it's bad for productivity, to put it mildly).<p>It isn't for every company, and it isn't for every developer.

Platformers for PC with (virtual) high speed movements come to mind as a common example of this.<p>Even multiplayer games suffer of this; in most online FPS if the server suddenly slows down all the players start experiencing lag and everyone looks like they are ""teleporting""; with a not-fixed-timestep you could slow everyone down so the problem becomes a lot less frustrating because the player still have complete control and understanding of their in-game character; just a bit slow-mo until the server speeds up to normal. The teleporting should be used only to sync with the server when the client connection is the one with problems updating.",1355834330

Especially for a down-and-dirty, early-stage site or service. Think about CraigsList: the site looks like it could conceivably have existed on text-based interfaces in the early 1980s. And that simplicity is part of its ease of use.<p>I'm not suggesting good design doesn't matter. But pretty, for pretty's sake, is overrated. The primary goal of design is to entice people to use something, and to make using it as easy and rewarding as possible. Often, this means making something as minimalist as possible. Depending on your targeted early adopters, they may be willing to overlook an ugly site if they derive a lot of value from using it.<p>In a weird way, I almost have the opposite gut reaction to yours when I encounter an early-stage service. If it's <i>too</i> slick and professional looking, I start wondering where the dollars are being spent, and where the priorities are. Especially if the startup is pre-funded or bootstrapped. Champagne tastes on beer budgets are often harbingers of doom.<p>As a corollary, I will say that people seem a lot more forgiving of ugliness if the service is very novel. The more new-to-the-world your product or service is, the more people will put up with its warts and irregularities (at least in the beginning). Conversely, if your product is attemting to outcompete an established competitor, design becomes a fairly big priority: not graphic design, per se, so much as UX design (think: the simplicity of Google vs. the complexity of Yahoo).",1355834269

Blaze is the continuation of that vision<p>>  i guess the AST is fed to something that does the work. and that something will have an API and be replaceable.<p>Precisely, we build up a intermediate form called ATerm out of the construction expression objects, do type inference, graph rewriting, and then pattern match our layout, metadata, and type information against a number of backends to find the most optimal one to perform execution. Or if needed we build a custom kernel with Numba informed by all this type and data layout information we've inferred from the graph.<p>We don't aim to solve all the subproblems in this area ( expression optimization passes, distributed scheduling ) but I think we have a robust enough system that others can build extensions to Blaze to do expression evaluation in whatever fashion they like.<p>> are there more details?<p>Yes!

I take it that RESPA is the partitioning of the time evolution operator into components with different force gradients, and the application of different integration schemes to those components.\nOne can also generalise leapfrog to integrate the momentum (or some part) with n steps of dt/n.<p>The metric used to describe their accuracy is the degree to which they violate the conservation of energy, which can be shown to be an odd integral power of the timestep dt per step [0].  The error in leapfrog goes like the 3rd power.<p>Higher order integration schemes can be derived e.g. [1]. \nThey may not be useful in practice, depending on the cost of\ncomputing the individual terms and the accumulation of finite precision errors.  But the known scaling behaviour provides a nice way of verifying the calculation of the evolution operators.\nAnother nice thing to do is to compute the ""round trip"", i.e. integrate forwards in time, and then backwards.  With a symmetric integrator you should end up where you started in terms of position, momentum and energy, regardless of step size, so computing a suitable difference and seeing how it scales with trajectory length can be informative. (e.g. one can compute a Lyapunov exponent from such round-trips to see if the underlying dynamics are chaotic).<p>[0] McLachlan and Atela, Nonlinearity 5 (1992)\n<a href=""http://www.massey.ac.nz/~rmclachl/si.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.massey.ac.nz/~rmclachl/si.ps</a>  (PS)\n[1] M.

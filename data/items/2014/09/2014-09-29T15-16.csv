Nobody in politics has any good ideas about anything, and most political jaw-flappers sound like they&#x27;re hailing from some kind of parallel universe where their obsolete world views make sense.

You are visiting a website that CloudFlare is serving, and you have encryption to that.<p>Other replies have already gone into how HTTPS never guaranteed anything about what happened after that, but I think that&#x27;s the wrong POV. What HTTPS guarantees is that one of the central certificate authorities have authenticated that the entity they have granted the cert to is indeed that entity, and the entity can then do whatever they please with that certificate. (Which may be wrong, in which case you have already lost.)<p>If the entity chooses to grant CloudFlare the authority to speak in their name, then it is a statement on their part that they trust CloudFlare to do so. It is not particularly different than any other bit of internal traffic. It is and always has been the responsibility of the certificate-owning entity to decide what to do with their certificate.<p>This isn&#x27;t new. This isn&#x27;t even <i>remotely</i> new. The concept of allowing designated others to speak in someone&#x27;s name is ancient, and even in the SSL world it has been going on forever. How many HTTPS sites are being served by Amazon or Rackspace or Linode, which are all technically capable of intercepting the plaintext request at will, or forging the response, or just plain stealing the certificate? It&#x27;s bizarre to me to see people flipping out as if CloudFlare is doing something new, when it isn&#x27;t new in the slightest. HTTPS has <i>never</i> been an assertion that the certificate holder is the only participant in the transaction. It has <i>always</i> been a statement of trust by the cert holder that everyone involved in the transaction is trustworthy, and it has <i>always</i> been the case that that statement could be in error, and it has <i>always</i> been the case that if that is so, you&#x27;ve already lost anyhow.",1412006209

8383463,comment,8381279,8381279,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"An exponential function, if you zoom in to your local spot, looks linear. This got Malthus. (Actually, Malthus&#x27;s model was wrong but his conclusion wasn&#x27;t far off. The world had been continually experiencing Malthusian catastrophes until about 1850, when the rate of economic growth overtook population growth. Colonialism was, to a large degree, Europe outsourcing its Malthusian catastrophes. For an intra-continental example, see: Irish potato famine.) He thought economic growth was linear, not exponential.<p>OP&#x27;s claim that 1913 to 1967 was an era of minimal (linear) change couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. While many nations returned to economic &quot;trend line&quot; there was a lot of, um, painful stuff in between. Even if you downplay World War I and II, you&#x27;ve still got the 1918 flu, the Great Depression, etc. Also, the US went from a regional power to a superpower in about 30 years, while Europe dealt with poverty (and lingering remnants of fascism) into the 1960s. That&#x27;s a change. Only Americans (excluding those who served in the wars) had the privilege of saying that 1913 to 1967 was a smooth ride.<p>Oddly enough, this time period (in which he understates progress) was written when world GDP growth was at its all-time (unmatched, even now) peak of 5.7% per year (we&#x27;re around 4.5% now, which is better than we&#x27;ve been). The R&D efforts that didn&#x27;t seem to be delivering (because flying cars and AI hadn&#x27;t been invented yet) were <i>already</i> pushing the economy to grow faster than it ever has (and will have, as of 2014). It got a bad rap (&quot;people in those cushy R&D labs aren&#x27;t earning their keep&quot;) because it underperformed relative to unreasonable expectations, not because it wasn&#x27;t working. (Oh, and there was that perceptron thing; the bit of high-school geometry needed to show that a <i>single</i> perceptron can&#x27;t do XOR became &quot;neural networks don&#x27;t work&quot; became &quot;AI is a dud&quot;.) So we have a lot to learn from the 1960s, and as a society, we should consider dumping the Snapchat nonsense in order to some real R&D.",1412006193

The long and short is you get slightly different significances under what model you assume, but in all cases you should consider it easy to calculate an exact significance subject to your assumptions.  In this case it says differences this large would only be seen in about 1.8% to 2% of the time (a two-sided test).  So the result isn&#x27;t that likely under the null-hypothesis (and then you make a leap of faith that maybe the rates are different).  I&#x27;ve written a lot of these topics at the Win-Vector blog <a href=""http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/05/a-clear-picture-of-power-and-significance-in-ab-tests/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/05/a-clear-picture-of-po...</a> .<p>They said they ran an A/A test (a very good idea), but the numbers seem slightly implausible under the two tests are identical assumption (which again, doesn&#x27;t immediately imply the two tests are in fact different).<p>The important thing to remember is your exact significances/probabilities are a function of the unknown true rates, your data, and your modeling assumptions.  The usual advice is to control the undesirable dependence on modeling assumptions by using only &quot;brand name tests.&quot;  I actually prefer using ad-hoc tests, but discussion what is assumed in them (one-sided/two-sided, pooled data for null, and so on).  You definitely can&#x27;t assume away a thumb on the scale.<p>Also this calculation is not compensating for any multiple trial or early stopping effect.  It (rightly or wrongly) assumes this is the only experiment run and it was stopped without looking at the rates.<p>This may look like a lot of code, but the code doesn&#x27;t change over different data.",1412005545

The first is <i>Understanding Michael Porter</i>, which gives a good summary of the main ideas of his works.

Large, dependable projects, with a long projected usage, have some general requirements that are well-known and tend to be the same for most of them. They include ease of training, ease of hiring, ease of reading and modifying other people&#x27;s code, ease of upgrade, ease of debugging, ease of profiling, ease of monitoring running software and more. In short, ease of maintenance. Languages built by the industry and designed and used by industry tend to put a lot of emphasis on this, while languages built in academia tend to care more about language expressiveness, code reuse (through graceful abstractions) etc.. Those are important things that matter to the industry too, but not nearly as much as the ones I mentioned. Because language maintainers have limited resources, often one set of requirements comes at the expense of the other. Sometimes the concerns in the latter group can even directly conflict with those in the first; for example, powerful abstractions can become too clever, hard to learn, and hard to understand by reading the code (I think this might be the case with Haskell, but not necessarily so for any hypothetical &quot;academic&quot; language).",1412004528

The tools &quot;statistically significant&quot; winners MUST be taken with a grain of salt.<p>On the user side, you simply cannot trust the tools. To avoid these pitfalls, I&#x27;d recommend a few key things. One, know your conversion rates. If you&#x27;re new to a site and don&#x27;t know patterns, run A/A tests, run small A/B tests, dig into your analytics. Before you run a serious A/B test, you&#x27;d better know historical conversion rates and recent conversion rates. If you know your variances, it&#x27;s even better, but you could probably heuristically understand your rate fluctuations just by looking at analytics and doing A/A test. Two, run your tests for long after you get a &quot;winning&quot; result. Three, have the traffic. If you don&#x27;t have enough traffic, your ability to run A/B tests is greatly reduced and you become more prone to making mistakes because you&#x27;re probably an ambitious person and want to keep making improvements! The nice thing here is that if you don&#x27;t have enough traffic to run tests, you&#x27;re probably better off doing other stuff anyway.<p>On the tools side (and I speak from using VWO, not Optimizely, so things could be different), but VWO tags are on all my pages.

&quot;<p>You are being either extremely confused or employing a pretty smarmy rhetorical tactic by equating what the thread was about, source compatibility, and jvm support lifetimes.<p>&quot;I have suggested changing this multiple times, so that the HN peanut gallery isn&#x27;t intellectually overwhelmed with the epoch.major.minor.patch scheme anymore.&quot;<p>Here you further degrade your argument by:<p>1) debasing the people who are arguing against you, people who have used and are using Scala currently and historically, just because they have issues with your pet language and<p>2) belittling the actual issue with using a semantic version number without using semantic version scheme.  Some of the high level complaints about Scala include that they don&#x27;t follow industry standards, that they show a lack of industry experience, that there is no idiomatic Scala way for newcomers to adopt.  All of those are in evidence with the way they handle compatibility and versioning.  It&#x27;s not a reason in and of itself to give up on the language, but it is a damning problem that many  people have run into many times.  Scala is getting better at this but they have traditionally been abysmal so that is small comfort.<p>&quot;You could also run old Scala code on a current JVM.
_But_ you can also deploy current Scala to a 10 year old JVM, which is not possible with Java.&quot;<p>Once again you are either intentionally changing the goal posts, or are showing extreme ignorance.  We were talking about source compatibility.  You can count on 1 hand the number of source compatibility issues you will run into with a 1.4 code base and a modern jdk.  Even turning on deprecations will leave you with a very small amount of changes that need to be done.  This is an extremely valuable property for some projects.  Instead of trying to argue poorly against this benefit with bad rhetorical techniques, why don&#x27;t you just admit what the rest of us know.  Java made compatibility a huge priority.  That it is a huge priority causes many many issues with the language.  For many projects those issues make other languages more appropriate, but for others it is a huge boon.  Scala simply made different trade offs, which make it more appropriate for some projects and less appropriate for others.<p>I am a Scala developer currently and hope they don&#x27;t try to emulate the compatibility model of the Java world because the kinds of projects I work on are better served without it.  But I completely agree with pron when it comes to dismissing it as suitable for a large project with long time horizons.<p>Finally, another thing I have to fight as a Scala developer in discussing it&#x27;s suitability is a perception that the Scala community is overrun with zealots who dismiss real industry concerns at the altar of cutting edge features.  I think that is a real but overblown concern, but you are displaying all the hallmarks of that caricature.  You are making my job harder. Please stop.",1412003475

What you should do is precalculate a sample size based on the statistical power you need, which involves determining your tolerance for the probability of making an error and on the minimum effect size you need to detect.  Then, you run the test to completion and crunch the numbers afterward.  This helps prevent the scenario where your page tests 18% better than itself by minimizing probability that your &quot;results&quot; are just a consequence of a streak of positive results in one branch of the test.<p>I was also disturbed that the effect size was taken into account in the sample size selection.  You need to know this before you do any type of statistical test.  Otherwise, you are likely to get &quot;positive&quot; results that just don&#x27;t mean anything.<p>OTOH, I wasn&#x27;t too concerned that the test was a one-tailed test.  Honestly, in a website A/B test, all I really am concerned about is whether my new page is better than the old page.  A one-tailed test tells you that.  It might be interesting to run two-tailed tests just so you can get an idea what not to do, but for this use I think a one-tailed test is fine.  It&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re testing drugs, where finding any effect, either positive or negative, can be valuable.<p>I should also note that I only really know enough about statistics to not shoot myself in the foot in a big, obvious way.  You should get a real stats person to work on this stuff if your livelihood depends on it.",1412003349
8383205,comment,8380105,8382926,0,0,pron,,,"You can dismiss my claims (hey, I&#x27;m just expressing my opinion), but to make one point clear: I have over 20 years experience writing software professionally (yeah, I got my first paid programming gig at a relatively young age), and I&#x27;ve been following Scala since its initial release. A few years ago I tried switching my project&#x27;s team from Java to Scala, and the results of the experiment were <i>very</i> negative. True, my hands-on Scala experience (which was rather comprehensive at the time) ended several years ago, but much has changed for the worse since then, though some has changed for the better in the past few years. I don&#x27;t need to try and switch a ten people team to Scala with every major version in order to make valid claims. What killed us then was that Scala was posing as &quot;a better Java&quot; -- less boilerplate etc. -- while in fact it was &quot;a more complex Haskell, minus all the constraints which make Haskell safe&quot; (in addition there were serious compatibility issues and more). We found that Scala code was less readable, and getting people to understand other people&#x27;s code was a lot harder than in Java. In short, the language was the exact opposite of what a large scale, dependable project required, so we ended the experiment. Since then, Scala has gotten a lot more complex with even more features.<p>Also, your insistence that Scala isn&#x27;t a research language is based on... I don&#x27;t know what. Unlike, say, Clojure or Erlang, that tried to solve specific software engineering pain points (state management, fault tolerance), Scala started as a research language designed to test a PL hypothesis: how well can FP and OOP mesh, and will doing so be helpful. It also experimented with advanced type systems, and recently with statically typed language. None of the motivations behind these features was an industry problem. No one in the industry said, &quot;you know what, type safe macros is what&#x27;s going to make our automation control software easier to maintain&quot;. Their motivation came from conjectures compiler writers had about novel language features and how they might be used when writing a piece of code. You can deny this all you want, but those are facts. What is opinion is the analysis of the result: I claim that the result is a kitchen-sink language with too many features -- most of them marginally useful when building the next stock-market exchange -- and all of them contribute complexity whose cost far exceeds its benefit, resulting in a language whose net contribution <i>to industry projects</i> (not research projects) is negative. Feel free to disagree. If you think valid claims only pertain to the discussion of the for comprehension syntax, then you should try managing large projects and see that it&#x27;s the philosophy of the language and combination of features that matters.",1412003331

5806631,comment,5805020,5806357,1,0,digikata,,,"And before you compare per-capita costs of the piecemeal US public system to those of the entire UK NHS system. The limited public system in the US is typically caring for a patient in a older demographic (medicare), and some portion of people on disability, and war vets (if you include the VA).  All of which might be expected to carry a higher need for medical care then the entire UK demographic. Essentially, it pulls a higher cost slice of patients in the US off the private healthcare systems books - and even at that comparisons that I've looked at seem to point to the private system being some multiple of 50-300% more expensive than public health system.",1370131145
5806630,comment,5805971,5805971,5,0,freework,,,"Like all other interviewing ""processes"", this is too much overhead.<p>I can tell after talking with someone for 5 minutes whether have the right stuff or not. You can tell by how they choose their words and express their opinions.<p>The best interview process:<p>1. Candidate sends company a resume.<p>2. Company reviews resume and likes what they see<p>3. Company calls candidate for a quick 5-10 minute call.<p>4. Questions asked are ""What are you currently working on/thinking of starting"" (referring to any kind of extra-work projects the candidate might have), ""what is your favorite language and why"", ""what is your favorite library/framework and why"", etc. Like I said before, its usually pretty obvious who comes from experience and who is novice. For instance if someone said they prefer PHP over C# because ""PHP is faster"", you can assume that person isn't the most experienced... The other day I sat in an interview where the candidate was an older guy (grey haired who graduated in the early 90s). Not even 25 seconds into the interview and I knew immediately that he was the read deal. It was something about how his stories seemed to have the right details. The problem is that it takes experience to judge experience. When I was 22 years old (which is the average age of most startup founders these days it seems), I would have been more likely to dismiss him as an old grey haired coot whose skills are outdated.<p>5. Company decided candidate is experienced and invites the candidate to a face to face. This may include travel expenses if the candidate is not local. At this point the company pretty much makes the decision to hire the person.<p>6. During the face to face, the objective is to give the candidate a clear description of what the company expects in terms of work hours, salary and benefits, etc. Also, what kind of problems they are working on, what kind of technology they use, company culture, etc.<p>7. Candidate and company negotiate, and then eventually agree on terms of employment. Candidate starts whenever possible.<p>The problem is that it takes a good developer to know another good developer. If you are a non-technical person, or a low-experience developer, you don't have much intuition to go off of. Instead you have to resort to making candidates jump through hoops by making them do things like FizzBuzz.<p>Another thing I should say. Interviewers should focus less on judging the candidate based on personality. The way I see it, as long as you're passionate about the right things, I don't mind if the person is prone to jerk like behavior every now and again. All brilliant people in the history of mankind have been described as ""jerk"" at one point or another. In my experience, the truly talented will always set aside their sometimes giant egos in the end for the benefit of the project. Its kind of like Justin Bieber. Despite him getting into controversy all the time, he still manages to get out there every night to put on a show that makes the fans keep coming back for more. The day his promoters stop putting up with his crap, is the day he fails to draw ticket sales.<p>In other words, more companies need to stop basing their hiring practices on repelling people prone to ""Beiber behavior"", and need to start basing it on bringing in people capable to drawing ""Bieber crowds"".",1370131110

However, the chance a drug is developed in the first place is dependant on the total size of the market for that drug.  If the potential profit for, say, a breast cancer cure is $300 billion rather than $100 billion then there is more chance that a cure will be found.",1370131078

5806626,comment,5805971,5806493,1,0,ownagefool,,,"The real problem with interviews, as shown in the very first question is that they're setup for you to tell the interviewer what they want to hear.  Interviews can often go one of two ways, the way where you're honest or the way where you lie.  The folks you're trying to hire are smart enough to tell you what you want to hear about company culture, smart enough to blag about commerical experience they don't really have, and smart enough to realise being honest didn't get them the job when they tried it.<p>Theres only a couple of things that actually matter when you're hiring: a) do you trust the guy; b) do you think he can do the job; c) how hard will he work.  Unfortunately a) is based on feeling, c) is nearly impossible to gauge but you can probably workout b) from a decent technical interview.  Using anything else as a qualifier will open you up to deceit and really doesn't have a lot of place in your trade of skills for money, unless you're trying to create the type of company where people don't go home, in that case hire them young and dumb.<p>For the record, I have a personality but like 90% of the adult population, I'm a fairly decent person, can talk to pretty much anyone and can easily find common ground with most people.  If you have a company culture that honestly forbids that, you've probably accidently hired a few asshats and that's probably something you want to kill rather than grow.<p>Wish the OP all the best though. :)",1370131072

5806620,comment,5805460,5806225,6,0,rz2k,,,"By their nature, almost all economic transactions in a free market system are mutually beneficial to both parties or the transaction wouldn't take place. That does not mean that many companies do not make short-sighted decisions that harm themselves, their industry, and customers over the long term.<p>Here is a small list of examples which might serve as examples where decisions eventually hurt the company itself rather than only customers:<p>- early refusals to sell music, movies or television shows online<p>- highly inconvenient DRM strategies<p>- ""closed software is more secure"", and other non transparent practices<p>- cost cutting measures by manufacturers that reduce a product's durability in ways that are not obvious in the store<p>Google could monetize the information they can mine from their users more aggressively. They could also more actively depart from standards, such as by removing IMAP access to Gmail or requiring some proprietary plugin for Youtube. We'd be worse off, and Google would lose a lot of users and ad-viewing eyeballs. That still doesn't mean that it is a given that they would make these decisions. Facebook seems to have little reluctance when it comes to changing user agreements in non-obvious ways for the purpose monetizing their data, I switched from Yahoo mail to Gmail eight or nine years just because of IMAP, and Microsoft tried to push Silverlight for video content.<p>Even in the case of a cooperative game where mutually beneficial choices can be determined, that outcome is not always the result. What's wrong with being grateful that Google (at least some of the time) has apparently chosen such strategies? Claims that their benefit is somehow at the expense of users confuses the situation with noncooperative games, and suggests that Google would be better off not making the decisions that have benefited users, too.",1370130950

One who is unselfish has a reward system that is aligned with the benefit of others.

I took an intro CS class my senior year, loved and excelled in it, and have taught myself quite a bit online. I'm thinking about going back to school so I can have a few years to really dive into all these CS concepts and learn them back and front.

At least, though, they were the only two countries that could manage it.\nNice article but it gets the time-scales slightly wrong.<p>The Soviet Union tested their first device in 1949.<p>The United Kingdom in 1952 (and their first thermonuclear bomb in 1957).<p>France in 1960.<p>China in 1964.<p>So by the time this programme began, all the countries in the NPT nuclear club already had fission bombs and at least the UK had a hydrogen bomb.

Given smart (but not Einstein smart) trained physicists with access to the publicly available literature, the answer they come to is 3 man years.

They conclude that ""its not surprising China has progressed so rapidly"".<p>Finally its also worth noting that the reviewers were less confident in the design then the scientists were, they dont say it wouldn't work, just that it would need testing to work out the kinks (which the designers also say they just seem to expect less bugs :)",1370129910

5806556,comment,5804798,5804798,39,0,77ThrowAway77,,,"So I'll give my general experience. I'm a RoR developer making 450k a year. It took about 3 years of non stop pushing myself (80/hr a week or more) to get here. I'm fairly unknown as a developer, so I'm not one of the bigger names. I work for a consulting company like Accenture or IBM global services. How I got here:<p>Basically I was a Java dev and pretty much knew RoR would be big, and knew there were guys making 100k+ at it (this was 2008). At the time I was making 75k as a Java guy and I just wanted to see if I could become one of the best. So i worked at it night and weekends, virtually non-stop till I got a Ruby position for 85k. That let me spent all my time on Ruby which was helpful. I tried for find every little scrap of info that would help, and overtime I got better.<p>I got a job for 130k 6 months later and my mind was blown. It was so much money to me it was just unreal. I didn't take it for granted though, I went in and worked my butt off to try and tackle every big problem there was and tried to pre-emt and issues that I saw, so I had a solution as soon as the problem came up. That went on for about a year.<p>All this time the main thing is that I kept working on all my skills, everything big and complex I could get my hands on that is. So I knew how to troubleshoot any performance issue that came up, etc. I also relentless kept it touch with recruiters. I know a lot of people on HN and Reddit aren't too fond of them but I love them.<p>I did whatever I could to help them out when they were looking for people, and made good connections because of that. When they emailed me I would just quote a ridiculous  rate like $200/hr and be polite about it.<p>Eventually I formed a contact with a large consulting company and they said they could offer me something good but not what I wanted. I did the interview and go the highest tech score in the country (a lot of that due to the fact that there were slim pickings). They made the offer but I turned them down. They said okay.<p>A few months later they got desperate and gave me the rate I wanted. I was more than blown away, it didn't seem real at all.<p>I went to the client location and yeah, it wasn't glorious work but the pay was insane, so I've kept at it. I live pretty frugally, more or less just stocking the money away so when the gravy train ends I won't have to work as much.<p>What do I attribute it to?<p>1) Work insanely hard. 40 hour work weeks are good and healthy, but I think it's harder to become super successful without working a lot. As an employee when I was getting paid that 130k I worked 65/hr a week even though I was only getting paid for about 45 of those hours, just because I wanted them to know I was insanely aggressive.<p>2) Find people's problems and solve them. I always tried to befriend high level people and solve their problems to the point that they see me as invaluable. When I got the 450k job I made friends with all the project directors, found out their problems (like performance) and would fix it and surprise them with it. This helped me to cement my place at the company to the point that I was able to have a lot of control and influence within it.<p>3) Be nice to people even when they are mean. I get insulted by the client company often. Their developers tell me I'm an idiot. That's sort of the nature of being a consultant. The big thing is that I'm always polite even if I don't think it's warranted. So I'll say ""Hmm, interesting, why do you say that"". And then politely explain why they are wrong and then make them not feel too bad about it by saying ""Actually it's easy to be confused over those things because of...""<p>That is probably more of a book report than is needed but that's about it. The one thing I will say is that the money, while very good and nice to have, wasn't the end all be all that I thought it would be. I figured I'd easily meet the right woman with all the money I have, but I haven't, in fact the women I have mentioned it to on dates didn't even care (or believe me, or both). I don't really get treated any differently either, other than by the developers who know that I know what I'm doing. I also realized that I don't care about material things all that much. The most fun I get is out of achieving new things, rather than things the money can buy.<p>In the end I'd say the success was a result of hard work, a lot of luck and aggressively marketing myself.",1370129842

But I'm unclear on the end-to-end performance comparison, which includes the cost of copying data to and from the device.<p>I know you guys are eyeballs deep in your data, so what's obvious to you may not be obvious to a reader. From what I can tell, your performance numbers are reported as an average per regex. But you're calculating that without including the string copying cost; you're only timing the cost of performing the computation on the GPU.<p>You show the overhead in absolute numbers. It seems small compared to the cost of processing the whole file, but I need to know the cost for grep to process that whole file as well. Basically, you show me a number, but you don't explain the significance of this number.<p>In my experience, the best way to deal with such issues is to always report entire-application performance.

The general consensus at the moment in the industry is that Google is desperately trying to move further and further away from signals that are more easily manipulated than things such as links.<p>As a result you have things like Google+ and Authorship coming into play, and even if they aren't officially ranking signals RIGHT NOW it's almost a certainty that that won't always be the case.

Makes demands of the candidate before selling the role (in fact, explicitly!)<p>I recommend you don't do this. Instead, make a point of going out of your way to sell your company and your role to your candidates before you do <i>anything</i> to screen them.<p>This serves three purposes: (1) sure, it makes it marginally more likely that you'll keep high-value candidates engaged who'd otherwise fall out of your pipeline at/after ""stage 1""; (2) more importantly, it helps disarm the interview process, both by establishing that <i>you, the employer</i> are going to put the effort and initiative into keeping the process running and establishing that tone for the whole process, and, even more importantly, by making the candidate actually want the job so they'll perform better during the process; and, (3) it's both the right thing to do and a noticeable difference from most firms' terrible hiring processes, which is good for marketing.<p>2. Is extremely subjective<p>Right out of the gate you're asking the candidate questions you can't possibly be benchmarking. ""Code you're proud of""? What if the code the candidate is most proud of is something simple that been super useful on lots of projects? What if the candidate cherry-picked it from their code to demonstrate the most complicated stuff they've worked with? How will you compare it to every other code sample you get across the lifetime of your company? You're doing that, right? Keeping track of how well your hiring process predicts performance?<p>2a. Culture fit<p>Beware culture fit questions. You state it outright later in your process when you say (paraphrased) ""you can train technology but personality mismatches are impossible"". That's a recipe for hiring the same 10 dudes who like roughly the same X360 games. I know that sounds hyperbolic, but look around you at other companies and tell me that isn't a real concern.<p>Two other problems with culture fit questions: (a) they mask irrational responses from interviewers, which happen <i>all the time</i>. Some of your best performers do badly on interviews, because they just don't interview well. Some of those people (ironically, it seems to be those people in particular) will be hard on candidates who have the same problem. Why are you setting the expectation with your team that they should ding candidates for intangible, irrational, or subjective concerns?<p>In neither (2) or (2a) am I arguing that you should only be hiring based on measured defect density or ability to correctly estimate how much time feature X would take† or typing speed. If there are specific personality traits you need to select for, that's fine: just select for them deliberately, and train your team how to select for them, and track how you're doing.<p>3. The tryout project<p>This is going to make me sound like a jerk for at least 2 reasons I can immediately think of, but, to sacrifice (a lot of) tact for (a little) clarity:<p>I think less of teams that propose short contracting projects to candidates to try them out, because I would never agree to interview on those terms.<p>Here are the problems I have with this approach: (a) it invites/provokes an argument during your hiring process about what a good daily rate is, (b) it asks the candidate to negotiate an hourly rate in a situation where their leverage is egregiously compromised, which is unethical, (c) job searches are full-time jobs by themselves, and your best candidates are <i>almost invariably already employed</i>, so how could it be reasonable to demand they take a temp job with you as part of that search, (d) it requires you to demand the candidate produce billable work and assign the resulting IP before the candidate is sure they're going to accept the offer they might get from you, (e) the tryout project is deceptively low-information.<p>On that last point: I guess I've hired a person or two in my career that ended up not working out almost immediately. But usually, the dealbreaker problems I've had with coworkers or employees took months to surface. Lots of people can be productive for a short, high-stakes sprint. But virtually no dev team is hiring for that; they're hiring for the ability to be reliably productive, to exercise good judgement in design and estimation, and be compatible with the decision making process the team uses.<p>Yes, the tryout project proves the candidate can produce code you might deploy on your website. I hope I'm not the first to tell you that that is a very low bar; lots of high school students can do the same.<p>Please please please take this comment in the spirit I intended it. I expect lots of smart people will disagree with some or all of it, and would be happy to learn from them. I'm pretty convinced though that the conventional interview system that some of the smartest teams use is fatally flawed in a bunch of ways, and this hiring process is an opportunity for me to start talking about why.<p>%. One last point because I am on a tear about this lately<p>I would like to start establishing a meme: Job Interviews Are Hostile For Candidates.<p>Normal people don't enjoy interviewing for jobs. Normal people find the experience off-putting. They're nervous. They're dealing with a procession of people each of whose stated position is to judge them. Normal people don't like being judged by strangers. They sit there and read tea leaves from behavioral cues about whether they're coming across well. In my experience, this happens even in phone interviews, which (can we also establish this meme?) <i>are the worst</i>.<p>I am not saying don't interview people. I'm just saying when you do it, assume all the signals and readings you're getting from your candidate are janky as hell, because they are. Lots of strong performers can't do their best thinking and judging when they're conflicted and anxious. Compensate.<p>Whoah, long comment.<p>† <i>BTW: my favorite dev interview question</i><p>†† <i>There is a better way to write this paragraph but I'm pretty depleted right now so please excuse the clunky, combatitive tone.</i>",1370128869

They can subpoena Google to get my emails but they could do that 10 years ago, too. Whereas before there was total information asymmetry between the government and its people (the government knew far more about the people than the people knew about each other or the government) the Internet has more or less obliterated that asymmetry. The government can take measures like installing backdoors (and of course I agree that this shouldn't happen) but overwhelmingly the tide is pointing in one direction: towards informational equality.

I have known more than one programmer with a successful career that never studied any math beyond the required introduction to calculus and had long since forgotten most of that.<p>In short, I think the study of mathematics is very helpful to a programmer in both the general sense of improving their overall thought processes and in the specific of helping with certain types of problems, but it is not necessary for most.",1255701577

Truecrypt uses your passphrase to decrypt the key which is then used to decrypt the disk.
With a ID tag it would just match the tag generated number with it's own algorithm and then decrypt the disk .

885374,comment,883839,883839,0,0,kenyarmosh,,,"Having worked as a startup ""product guy"" for the last five years, I think there are some good answers to the original question.<p>Several notes:<p>1) If you fall into the trap of thinking that engineers, technologists, CEO's, and others can handle this role, you'll just be part of hundreds or startups that don't have their act together. I've sat down with way too many startups who both don't have a handle on the marketplace or customer needs and have poor processes in terms of planning / prioritizing release cycles and roadmaps. While others in the company should have a grasp of both of these elements, the key point is correctly identifying the first part (i.e., customer needs) and then mapping it to the second (i.e., the roadmap).<p>2) The person who fills this role should be fairly well-rounded and be sort of a weird breed in that they actually are comfortable (and good at) talking with people (customers) and yet can get down into technical details. I wouldn't go as far to say that coding is necessary but surely mocking up initial wireframes and UX should be considered as part of the job.<p>3) Related to terminology, I'd try to stay away from using labels like ""project manager"" or ""program manager."" These are way too broad and make it seem like the role is more focused on logistics and coordination. Above all, this role is strategic...keeping the trains running on time is just one aspect and arguably, not the most important.",1255701451

One could certainly accuse it of being arbitrary (given the independence proofs) and incomplete (given Gödel's 1931), but I wasn't aware that one could derive a contradiction in ZFC.

All of the obvious names for our product were already taken, and essentially none of them were actually in use.<p>My co-founder and I disagree on this one.  He makes the (very valid) point that right of first sale should apply to domains just like anything else, and if you want to buy one and do nothing with it (or nothing <i>yet</i>), then that should be valid.<p>I can't disagree with him on that basis, but I think that the law needs to treat domains identically with real estate.  In the former case, there are rules controlling what I can do with a piece of land I own; I am liable if it contains an attractive nuisance  (e.g., a trampoline or swimming pool) on which a neighbor is hurt--the same could apply to open proxies and bot boxes.  My neighbors have recourse if I allow my property to decay to the point where it is an eyesore or a health hazard.

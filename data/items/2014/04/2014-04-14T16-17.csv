7587306,comment,7581404,7582589,1,0,cprice404,,,"One minor point of clarification: this framework is <i>not</i> intended to prescribe that we (Puppet Labs) or anyone else should move all of their services into a giant monolothic process, a la JavaEE.  In fact, that&#x27;s one of the main reasons we decided to build the framework rather than use an existing solution.<p>Trapperkeeper is simply intended to give us the <i>flexibility</i> to decide how to bundle different services together.  If we have 2 or 3 tiny web services that can benefit from some shared state and are lightweight enough that they don&#x27;t really warrant running a separate web server for each one, now we can choose to deploy them that way.  But, absolutely, we can still run more than one instance of this framework on the same machine, to reap the benefits of truly isolated OS processes in cases where that is appropriate.<p>Another minor point to highlight is that, at Puppet Labs, we&#x27;re building on-premise software that our customers install and administer on their own networks.  We&#x27;re not building SaaS products that we administer ourselves.  This means that we need to be able to support a wider range of deployment configurations, so that we can tailor a particular installation to the needs of the particular user who is installing it.  For some users, they may have enough traffic to warrant peeling out every individual service to its own process and distributing them across many nodes.  For other users, they may have a very tiny network where it is perfectly sufficient (and much simpler) to run everything in a small number of processes on a single node.  The new framework is all about giving us the ability to make those choices more dynamically--not about prescribing a particular deployment model to all users.",1397494543

I worked at a huge multimillion dollar company who didn&#x27;t have any PM software in place. It was so bad because the project managers were running the asylum. Some had super tight deadlines and needed by 5pm TODAY. Others didn&#x27;t really care about the tasks, or would forget about them and then throw the developers under the bus. It was insane what was going on, and it was mainly due to not having some kind of software in place that keep track of the tasks and deadlines.<p>The company wasn&#x27;t going to go out of business anytime soon, but with all the business they had and more coming every month, how do you expect to have a quality product when your project management is a joke?",1397494224

However, it <i>also</i> moves the <i>rocket</i> 50 miles to the east. Net result is zero.<p>Imagine doing this in a gigantic train car. You launch a rocket to the end of the car and then have it come back. Does it matter which way the car is moving? Of course not. The roundness of the Earth complicates it a bit, but not much at these speeds and altitudes.<p>You do, in fact, maintain the same surface-relative speed as you go up. Well, until you move sideways enough that the Earth&#x27;s gravity exerts a significant sideways force, but that&#x27;s not going to be significant for a while. In any case it is gravity, not the rotation itself, that causes that.  You need to speed up to maintain the same <i>angular</i> velocity as you rise, but not your linear speed relative to the surface.",1397493969

However it <i>does</i> move the launch site closer to the rocket.<p><i>Very</i> rough numbers: earth rotates at about 1000mph at the equator, so if we fudge florida down to the equator and assume stage separation is at t+3:00, then in the elapsed time between launch and stage separation, the launch center has moved 50 miles to the east.  In the subsequent minutes up until first stage touchdown, it will move even further to the east.<p>Consider that just launching from the equator straight up to 35,786km would not put you into into a geostationary orbit; you would fall back down to the west of your launch site.  If you went straight up, while initially moving at the same horizontal velocity as the ground from which you launched, you would not maintain the same surface-relative velocity; you need to speed up going east to do that.

In short, when we talk about key derivation, we&#x27;re speaking of <i>keys</i> in a general sense - irrespective of purpose, they just need to be secure.<p>With that said, if your &quot;key&quot; actually consists of 128 bits (16 bytes) of secure random data (with all the conditions associated with that), then you&#x27;re right: the choice of KDF is mostly immaterial, so long as it preserves entropy. That&#x27;s why, for example, if you&#x27;re just generating a symmetric key for bulk encryption, you just grab (say) 128 bits of random data and use that as the key directly with no KDF involved.<p>KDFs really only enter the scene when: (1) you want to generate multiple keys from one &quot;master key&quot; or (2) you want to generate &quot;secure&quot; keying material from &quot;insecure&quot; keying material (say, a user&#x27;s password).<p>The choice of KDF, however, mostly depends on the strength of the original keying material. For instance, if you have 256 bits of secure random information as your keying material, using something like scrypt is unnecessary; something like HKDF would be more appropriate there. (No one will ever brute-force your 256-bit value. It&#x27;s just not happening: ever.) On the other hand, where the original keying material is weak, like in the case of passwords, you want to use something that prohibits rapid guessing, e.g. scrypt.",1397493501

Very few PM tools seem to facilitate this. Many of the corporate ones (as mentioned here and elsewhere) focus on completion in terms of tasks and dollars, and maybe resource assignment and forecast. That&#x27;s because what folks REALLY want to know - how close am I to getting what I thought I was paying for - is hard to measure objectively.

Related is up to a judge to decide if it gets to that point but some arguably obvious examples: making a game on the side while working for a game company. Making an email website while working for a company that makes an email website.<p>Why it makes sense IMO. Without the company owning work related to their business outside of work hours that would seem to make something along these lines legal.<p>Employee is at home, after work hours, and thinks of solution to problem at work on his project. The next day he comes to work and demands if the company wants this solution he must be compensated for work he did on his own time that belongs to him.<p>Your bartender case I have no idea how a judge would take that. The judge might see it as common sense. On the other hand if the bartender took a second job bartending a judge might decide that&#x27;s not okay. Examples: Bartender invents new drink in Bar #2. Does Bar #2 own that? Can Bar #2 trademark the new drink? Can Bar #1 claim bartender has a conflict of interest because while working at Bar #2 it&#x27;s arguably his job to lure people away from Bar #1.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from Nolo: &quot;<p>Moonlighting<p>Generally speaking, working more than one job is lawful.

For reasonable allocation rates found in typical GUI apps, most Java GCs do extremely well having very little additional memory, like only 20% more than the live set size. There is no &quot;twice as much&quot; assumption anywhere in their design.<p>Second, manual memory managers do have their own overhead too, in form of bookkeeping (e.g. free lists) and internal fragmentation. Fragmentation can be sometimes much worse than GC memory overhead for long running applications, because GC memory overhead is typically bounded, while fragmentation is either unbounded or has extremely high upper bounds (like 10x in &quot;fast&quot; allocators).",1397491781

They&#x27;ve yet to successfully recover a first stage.<p>Their most recent test went pretty well all things considered. For the first time they tried a &quot;death swoop&quot; maneuver, turning the 1st stage 180 degrees around as it was starting to re-enter and refire some of the engines to slow it down. It picked up a nasty roll though and centrifuged the propellant, cutting the engines prematurely. They recovered some debris but that&#x27;s about it.<p>It&#x27;s hard to overstate how big a deal it will be if they pull this off. But the odds of success are very low, given the propensity of these things to tumble and roll on reentry.",1397491368

Since the goal is to be re-useable without losing too much payload capability I really don’t think they can have much fuel to spare at that point. To decelerate and come to a hover, sure, that’s the goal, but to actually decelerate, accelerate in the opposite direction, decelerate again and come to a hover?

536598,comment,534679,536505,0,0,christofd,,,"You keep on insisting that ""more data"" is a bad idea. Economics has a long tradition of learning from Economic History and comparative observation. I can't resist quoting Google here, that ""more data"" is the way to go, as Norvig argues (slightly out of context; field is machine-learning): <a href=""http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_intelligent/intelligent/homepage/2009/x2exp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_intelligent/intellig...</a><p>I'm more or less arguing for that the IMF, or any other org. in those waters, has a lot of rich data in their possession. Well, here's an example: I worked for three years on a government-funded survey on ""barter networks in Eastern Europe"", where I did the number crunching on the data set... regression analysis, multivariate statistics etc. This resulted in one of the first extensive studies on contract theory in barter networks (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Contracts-Trade-Transition-Resurgence-Barter/dp/0262133997"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Contracts-Trade-Transition-Resurgence-...</a>). Basically in absence of cash to keep trade flowing you barter. Now if the U.S. financial system breaks down to the point where nobody can pay their suppliers and vendors etc. they'll have to pay each other with parts and other barter derivatives, passing around IOUs. Turns out, somebody looked at this and it works on a grand scale and even across borders. Anyway, there are lots of crazy ideas that you can try out and experiment with, looking at a rich data set of failed nations. I remember how expensive it was compiling all that data on barter networks (granted, we did the legwork; data was not from the IMF).<p>Regarding ""abuse through power aggregation in developing nations"" I don't have an example right now, on how that directly applies to the U.S. situation.",1238263098

536580,comment,536181,536393,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"My wedding took an hour and a half, with about 16 people there to witness, we went home and had like 60 people in the house for a party. Me and my wife went to bed at about 11 as we'd been up since like 5am, and the party went on without us. Like 5 lbs of bacon was cooked in the morning for everyone who staid over and then everyone was gone by 6pm the next day.<p>The wedding cost like $250 total, the food for the party cost $150. The wine for toasts and such cost us $40, other people through in up to $160 of wine. The cake was made by a family friend and paid for by another as our wedding present, so cost $0.<p>My wife and I spent more when we got an Xbox 360 than on our entire wedding. We are having another celebration this summer as my parents couldn't visit at the time and a lot of my wifes family couldn't get out to Ontario either, so the total price of our 'weddings' would probably have gone up, but again everybody is offering to do and pay for stuff so the total right now is at like $10.<p>I think the worst thing anyone can do is spend like $50,000 on a wedding, it'll just ruin your first year of marriage. I think the next worst thing, is to actually think living together married should be different from living together unmarried. My wife and myself got married after being together for years, it was because we were already committed, not because we needed to commit.",1238261768

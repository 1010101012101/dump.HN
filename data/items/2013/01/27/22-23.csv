How do you game this metric?<p>The fact that one company used a couple of bad objective metrics doesn't mean all objective metrics are bad. They are used with a great deal of success in many fields. Sales people are paid on commission, traders are paid proportionally to (risk adjusted) profits, etc. All it means is that if you set the wrong goals for your company, you'll probably succeed at the wrong thing.<p>So tell us - is ""maximize the % of students capable of multiplying/dividing 4 digit numbers"" the wrong goal?

Anything that is supported in Linux via a driver you could install via FF OS would be available to HTML5 apps. Printers, displays, thumbprint scanners, etc.<p>* Similar support for bluetooth devices, etc. as long as the driver could be coded to work on the device hardware, obviously.<p>* Gonk should be more dynamic, letting you declare drivers, etc. that you want to use via a path. It's primary purpose would become managing permissions between HTML5 apps and devices. As new devices come out, those could be added easily either by discovery or manual install. When the OS-level drivers are available, it would only be a matter of the HTML5 app declaring what it is able or needs to use and then it asks you (or you configure it) to allow access to the drivers/etc. and then your HTML5 app could use your new bluetooth retina scanner, for example, or control some new helicopter+videocam toy.<p>The way Firefox OS is now is just a Javascript replacement of Android's interface and it provides a similar level of access to the hardware. That is not enough. I don't want or need a Javascript phone and Javascript gaming device. I want to be able to use the same OS on my desktop as my phone, and if my phone has a USB plug, I should be able to plug one side into my Firefox OS phone and the other side into a label printer and print a label from my HTML5 app if I want.

Which means they want me to work on the same platform as well. I have almost exclusively used ubuntu for the last 3 years. The few times that I have used a macbook, the gestures and stuff have been very confusing. I code in python/django in vim. Here is what I'll need to customise, please suggest apps, tips, tricks, etc.:<p>1. I spend 99% of my time on a laptop between chrome and my terminal. Chrome should be the same I guess. Having used the mac terminal before, I have not been impressed. It seems really slow. I use oh-my-zsh. Is iterm2 any good? Can I fix the performance issues of the default terminal? Am I just hallucinating that the mac terminal is slower?<p>2. I have really gotten used to just apt-get installing stuff. Missing headers? No problem, just apt-get install xyz, problem solved. I have heard homebrew is good for OS X. Is it all I'll need?<p>3. I typically use a lot of tabs in my terminal and have some muscle memory built in for switching between them, moving them around, etc. Can i customise these shortcuts? I also have a workflow build around different workspaces in ubuntu. How can I achieve this in OS X?<p>4. I really like using vim in the terminal (allows me to quickly move in and out of the terminal). However, everywhere online, people recommend using MacVim coz apparently it doesn't work well enough in the terminal(?). If so, can this be fixed?<p>Any other tips or tricks I should know about?

For instance, you could write a canonicalization function to help you put the data into a more-queryable form. You can then even index on that function.<p>* Powerful triggers might help with post-processing, or putting data into some queue of ""bad data"" that needs to be cleaned up later. Maybe by doing so, you realize that the data isn't ""bad"", your schema just needs to be updated to reflect new interesting cases.<p>* You can pull data in from remote sources with foreign data wrappers, which might be necessary to clean the data up properly (e.g. one extra join against the company LDAP directory using the email might be able to canonicalize those employee names).<p>* You can catch errors using subtransactions and have a different processing path for data that doesn't fit in the schema.<p>Maybe some of these features exist in MySQL (I haven't been a real user since around 2003, aside from a bit of administration). But in postgres, these features all work together seamlessly along with all of the other features in postgres to make it all work <i>nicely</i> and without a pile of caveats.

For me, there is a real argument against the whole ""failure movement"", but it's not this one.<p>The problem with the startup-meme that failure is to be embraced is that it can cause people to lose sight of the fact that failure is a state you reach only after you make a real, concerted effort and have lots of corroborating evidence that you truly have no product-market fit. It's much more fun to build new projects than to go through the slog to get through the trough of sorrow. This being the case, it's very temping to quickly write off projects that seem to be going nowhere since it's now acceptable to fail, since it drops you back into the exciting mode where you are building stuff again and your imagination is the limit, both for the product and for the prospects of success.<p>In other words, I think there needs to be a clearer explanation of what ""failing fast"" really means. It means fail fast, but not too fast. You really need to be sure you're actually in a true failure mode and not just a few bug fixes and enhancements away from exiting a local minima. One of the biggest challenges is figuring out a way to determine if you are in hitting your head against a thick wall or a thin one.<p>I think this is one reason why it's very important to have very detailed metrics and data, and build in an experimental approach to product development so you can see just how much leverage you have when it comes to making incremental improvements. 10x'ing a 0.001% conversion rate doesn't really get you much, but 10x'ing a 0.1% conversion rate could make the difference between success and failure. Also detailed metrics can help reveal if there are certain breakdowns in your funnels that you would not be aware of if just looking strictly at inputs an outputs. A 0.001% conversion rate may mean that your product has no market, or it might mean you fucked up your Javascript on your credit card submission form. The only way to know is to measure.",1359326703

That may be right or wrong[1], but it has a big impact on the adoption of particular database systems or practices.<p>And it's somewhat irrelevant to this discussion, because there are many ways you can feed the data you want into postgres (like declaring columns BYTEA, TEXT, or HSTORE), no matter how ""bad"" it is. I would argue that it's much easier to deal with ""bad"" data in postgres than mysql because you have so much flexibility (e.g. write a function inside of postgres in PL/python to get some meaning out of the ill-specified data; or write some triggers to do post-processing).<p>[1] I personally think that a misalignment of incentives is responsible for the widespread focus on the ease of writing into a database without considering the utility of the data once it's in there.",1359326520

There seems to be a common theme that if a person like me is mentally ill, I must be imagining the harassment and bullying, and because I am mentally ill I am not valuable anymore and should be given a lower position and lower salary.<p>I mean the people who wrote those things don't really mean me any harm, and they are not technically harassing me or bulling me. But they misunderstand that if a person is mentally ill they are a liability, they will do less work, be less productive, they will imagine things and all the stress is in their head, and they have a lessor value than someone who is not mentally ill so they should be demoted for it.<p>Yes there is a semi-consciously bias here, and over time it grows into a mind-set, and when a group is using group-think they will gang up against such a person using the bias that because he/she is mentally ill, it makes things worse for us, so they have to do whatever they can to get rid of that person.<p>I cannot hide my mental illness, I don't have the 'passing skill' which is acting like a normal person and blending in. I don't have very much in the way of social skills because the mental illness affects the part of the brain that controls social skills and sometimes I don't get social clues. It is not the same as Asperger's Syndrome but it will make some people think that I have that. The mental illness affects the speech center of my brain and from time to time I mispronounce words accidentally and have a speaking tick that others make fun of. For example for breakfast at a meeting that had bagels and butter I asked ""Can you please pass me the butter."" but I mispronounced butter only to have a few people mock me saying ""Butter, butter, butter"" and laughing.<p>Yes they are like sharks who smell blood.<p>If I ever do go back to work, it will have to be the right company, with the right people, and the right management that does do things that ones in the past have done. One that does not discriminate against the mentally ill.<p>Imagine if instead of becoming mentally ill, I became blind instead. ""Well Orion because you are blind now, you don't have as much value as a programmer than someone who has sight. So we are going to demote you and lower your salary to a position you will be able to handle."" instead of ""Orion we will help you by installing software that converts text to speech for your PC and other equipment to get you back into programming.""",1359326180

It often gets noisy even for trivial cases like this one: the letters number appear four times in just a single line here, which as it turns out is just as much accidental complexity as using the explicit loop control variable in the imperative version <i>and</i> youve lost the visual cues to what each means that the indentation gives with the loop. For more complicated transformations, I find comprehension syntax also scales poorly.<p>I suspect (though Ive no hard data to back it up) that comprehension syntax actually isnt very readable in many cases, and that this may be why some people prefer the kind of code in the imperative example rather than any innate preference for imperative style <i>per se</i>. Personally, Id prefer to highlight the data flow but using more explicit transformations instead, such as (in a hypothetical functional programming syntax):<p><pre><code>    evens = filter {_ % 2 == 0} numbers\n</code></pre>\nPythons own syntax for this isnt quite as neat as some functional programming languages, IMHO, but I still prefer it to the comprehension:<p><pre><code>    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n    evens = filter(lambda n: n % 2 == 0, numbers)</code></pre>",1359326020

I know there are a lot of criticisms about this system, mostly in terms of cost but I have found it to be a huge improvement over any other self study course. Unless you are able to take off time and go live in the other country I think Rosetta Stone is the best option. I would go so far as to say that it is better than taking a night course at a local community college.<p>I do think the system has it flaws but it is definitely a big improvement over everything that has come before. I think the future of language learning will resemble Rosetta Stone but that it will use machine learning to be more dynamic and adapt itself to things that you are having trouble with, perhaps it will seem more 'croudsourced'.\n  Before Rosetta Stone I was making zero progress with German, after one year using a CD/Book approach I was continually forgetting vocabulary, unable to pronounce things, etc, etc. \n There is something about Rosetta Stone that is almost like falling into hours of mindless gaming. It never seems too hard to get stuck but it just keeps on pushing what I know little by little. \n I think that they should use photoshop to make their pictures more cheaply. Also, the milestone segments seem pretty worthless. Sometimes it would be nice to see the grammar of a practice sentence diagrammed so that I could go and read an analytic description of the grammar point.<p>For German more than for Spanish I'm finding it helpful to treat the Rosetta Stone as a supplement to other approaches especially as the grammar confuses me a great deal.<p>So while the program is expensive (I paid $500 for Spanish on disks and $329 for one year of online only access to the German) it is the only thing I have found worth spending money on short of immersion. If you have a 9-5 job then most likely Rosetta Stone will be a good time vs cost trade off. That has been my experience so far.",1359325349

Twitter is much more mainstream in the US than in France and other European countries. One source I found shows the active users by country [1]. Using those numbers and assuming 320 million population for the US and 65 mil. for France one can see that 7.15% of US americans are active per month while only 3.3% of French are active per month. My interpretation is that the twitter users in France are much less representative than in the US. Also it is much easier for a very small but active community to break into the trending charts.\nAnother hypothesis which I sadly could not find any numbers for is that the average twitter user in the US is posting MUCH more than the average french. Thus it is much more harder for fringe opinions to rise to the top trending.<p>2. Trending hashtags don't have to mean people have to endorse it. It could be a critical retweet or other kind of dismissal of racism. So just the fact that a racist hashtag is in the trending topic could also be interpreted as that people in france give a much larger response to racists tweets and try to express their dismay and thus circumstantially also push that hash tag. (I don't want to say that this actually happened)<p>But just these two points alone show why trending hashtags are a very weak indicator.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-countries-active-users_b28908"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediabistro.com/alltwitter/twitter-countries-acti...</a>",1359325080

It normally works with input and output latch chips, so you can use more that one input and output, and they get processed one bit at a time. Strangely, the program counter is on a separate chip (MC14516B), which is just a 4-bit binary counter.

You frequently repost long comments with lots of links which are merely reposts of comments on a related topic (for instance, your standard ""hiring practices"" comment). When I see one of your long-winded comments, I always wince a little bit, because sometimes it is a long-winded repost that is not quite relevant to the discussion at hand, and so while it may have some good information, it feels a bit like a hijacking of the thread. I would not be surprised if there were people who started automatically downvoting your comments for that reason.<p>That said, this comment in particular is pretty much spot on, and is perfectly relevant to the discussion at hand.<p>One of the frustrations I've always had as an adult male trying to learn languages is that many of the teachers don't actually have the linguistic training to describe some of the phonetic and grammatical distinctions they are trying to teach. For instance, when learning French, I was trying to figure out the liaison and enchainment system; and for the most part, it actually adheres to some fairly universal phonetic principles (though there's a bit of confusion do to the fact that there are some prestige dialect rules which get over-applied to sound more formal, which actually cause you to break those more regular and universal rules; this is not dissimilar to English in which prescriptivists try to over-apply certain grammatical rules to cases in which they just don't make sense). But I could never actually discuss this with my French teachers, because none of them had any kind of education in phonology and so didn't know anything about the terminology or rules.<p>It surprises me that many of those who teach language don't have any kind of formal training in how language actually works, how languages differ, and the like. Mostly, they are someone who is just a fluent speaker who happens to have studied a good deal of literature in the language.<p>Edit to add: ah, I just realized that you were talking about your earlier comment, about the list of languages and their similarity. I'm not sure why people would have downvoted that. My experience is that asking or complaining about downvotes on sites like Hacker News (or others where people vote anonymously, like Reddit or Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange) is generally fruitless; if the person wanted you to know why they had downvoted, they would have left a comment about it. If you have to ask, whoever downvoted probably isn't paying enough attention to respond. And asking and/or complaining about it can lead to the thread being somewhat derailed, like this one is starting to be (which is partly my fault for responding). So I've since stopped asking about downvotes; if I know what to fix, I fix it, if not, I just move on with my life.",1359324784

5125878,comment,5125827,5125827,5,0,tikhonj,,,"Basically, I personally take issue with the way Python handles global variables and, until Python 3, completely <i>fails</i> to handle non-local variables.<p>Let's take a trivial example that would work in JavaScript or Scheme. Often, I want to keep track of how many times a particular function gets called (usually for debugging). I would expect to be able to do something like this:<p><pre><code>    counter = 0\n    def foo(bar, baz):\n      counter += 1\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nThis does not work in Python. You could use the global keyword to work around this:<p><pre><code>    counter = 0\n    def foo(bar, baz):\n      global counter\n      counter += 1\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nThis is something of an ugly hack in the language design. Moreover, this falls apart if counter is not in the global scope itself--for example, if foo is defined inside another function. Python 3 introduces the nonlocal keyword to deal with this.<p>Fundamentally, this problem stems from the fact that Python conflates two fundamentally different operations: defining a variable and mutating it. I personally really like how Scheme handles this: defining and setting are two different actions, and trying to set a variable that has not been defined is an error. This makes the intentions of the programmer much clearer.<p>A very common pattern in Scheme and JavaScript (as well as other languages I don't use, no doubt) is to use closures to encapsulate state. Thanks to Python's scoping model, this is at best a pain and certainly unnatural.<p>There are also some minor annoyances. One that gave me problems recently (although it has been fixed in Python 3, I believe), was with list comprehensions:<p><pre><code>    [i * i for i in range(1, 10)]\n    print i # gives you 9!</code></pre>",1359324663

5125854,comment,5123035,5125263,1,0,saosebastiao,,,"> If it's just a question of accent then I would agree. But if it's a question of grammar and word choice I don't. The article isn't clear on that point, since Freakonomics is about junk science that titillates and not about actual science. If you ""sound black"" because you have an accent that's just a reflection of where you grew up. If you ""sound black"" because your grammar is bad it really does reflect on your education.<p>A dialect is a combination of accent, vocabulary, and grammar. And no, it doesn't reflect your education. It reflects the culture in which you were raised.<p>There literally is no Standard English, let alone a Standard American English dialect. If you have been taught that there is, you have been taught incorrectly. All languages evolve, as a result of culture (including pop culture), geography, and time period. Even today, linguists have no consensus on the proper third person pronoun to use for an anonymous or hypothetical person. Some might say ""He"", some might say a randomized version of ""He"" or ""She"", and some might say ""They"". As of 30 years ago, all of them would have told you ""He"", and that anything else was bad grammar. But culture (acknowledgement of sexism) combined with common usage (which was/is incorrect grammar) have definitively changed the accepted standard.<p>Languages change. This isn't just an attempt at being politically correct...it is a fucking truism. The simple fact that I am referring to you as ""you"" is an acknowledgement of this fact. A strict interpretation of ""you"" requires usage in a plural second-person context. Culture, specifically in the reference to royalty in the plural (an implicit acknowledgement of royalty as being ambassadors of God), changed it from a plural pronoun into a singular pronoun in limited use cases. Contextually improper and uneducated overuse of the form led to its complete abandonment as a plural pronoun. It is now considered a grammatically correct singular pronoun in every known English dialect today.<p>Any sort of attempt to legitimize one dialect as proper or as a standard is a pure manifestation of xenophobia at best. Within the context of the article, people confuse the African American Vernacular with the lack of an education. In reality, it is a racist expectation that those belonging to one culture conform to the independently evolved standards of the culture that systemically isolated them and abused them for hundreds of years. I never said that the article was about other countries. It is about the ability to look past someone's dialect to see their education and experience. ""Sounding Black"" doesn't make you stupid. It makes you different.<p>And if you can't learn to get over it, you don't deserve a well-payed professional job...the kind of job where you will meet and talk to people from thousands of different backgrounds, all of whom will be noticeably different from you. You deserve the ditch digger job where you can be racist and expect everybody else to conform to what you grew up with. And yes, that last sentence was grammatically correct as of a few decades ago. Get over it.",1359324351

Whenever you see Java, PHP, or C# you'll usually find the reason has something to do with the ability to hire 200 programmers to do the work of 2 or 3.<p>This is the office politics that kill companies, the usual Jimmy doesn't like Frankie stuff is minor and easily dealt with.

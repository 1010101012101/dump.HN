545991,comment,545897,545963,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"I've built a similar desk using the same door and a pair of  sawhorses. The door bows a bit if you're like me and pile books on your desk. It also feels like it is going to give out if you lean on it. The surface is a wood veneer - not good for writing. You pretty much have to apply the whiteboard type surface to the desk in order to get a smooth writing surface.<p>I decided that the finished tabletops from IKEA were a better value: the surface is already good for writing and they have more internal reinforcement so they don't bow or feel as flimsy.<p>My favorite DIY desk was made out of a solid core door from the Door Store[1] in Cambridge, MA and a pair of filing cabinets. However, solid core door prices are much more expensive than hollow core[2].<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.doorstorecambridge.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doorstorecambridge.com</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.doorstorecambridge.com/Pricelist_Tops1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doorstorecambridge.com/Pricelist_Tops1.htm</a>",1238813916

Most of them (there are 3 per day) aren't useful, but they're usually worth a skim. Also, if you don't have a company blog, start one. It's a good way for people to see what you're up to and encourages feedback and inquiries. We try to update our company blog once per week [1].<p>My advice is to be willing to talk to anyone and respond to customer feedback emails as quickly and helpfully as possible. You never really know who's on the other side of the email. And please don't ever ever use form letters; you're dealing with people, not robots.<p>One of our biggest press hits at TicketStumbler was in the Financial Times [2] [3]. Paul referred the writer to us as a freelancer who was still in graduate school, and I honestly had no idea the article would appear in the FT.

The language didn't matter; he got bested by the people who kept learning and exploring while he decided he had learned ""enough"" for one lifetime. He made the mistake of making it about those around him; he didn't want to continually improve, just better than those he would be compared with. He went from learning just enough to best people, to being smug, to being a curmudgeon against other languages/platforms/etc he professed to not know a lot about. I keep seeing evidence around me that this is a very counter-productive shortcut to take, but one that most people don’t own up to; props to him for being honest, but sad that it took him too long to come to reason about it. In an odd way, I see this same pattern of behavior in a lot of the one-language-wonder Java programmers I meet today; they know Java, and find what reasons they can to declare that all other languages suck.<p>So, your point about libraries is a good one, but I’d amend your remarks to advise cultivating an attitude toward development that makes using libraries and ideas of others almost instinctual, and that, I think, is by making sure you always stay hungry for knowledge.",1238811719
545954,comment,545545,545589,0,0,sgk284,,,"Interesting points you bring up and Google effectively came to the same conclusion when they were smaller (low hundreds instead of tens of thousands of employees). <i>Everything</i> at Google is data driven, including the hiring, but things have changed drastically. Back in the day, Larry and Sergey had a forumla that used the SATs and your graduating GPA. The theory was that your SAT was a measure of your potential, and your GPA was the ability to deliver on that potential. As you can imagine that ultimately ended in failure, but kind of an interesting idea none-the-less.<p>Since then they've wound up taking a much more Googly approach to hiring, by collecting tons of data from their employees. They effectively gave everyone a survey that attempted to figure out what defined the Google culture and success there-in. By hiring people consistent with this data, the theory is that they can better keep the culture and continue to hire successful engineers. Lots of interesting tidbits came from the study, but the most interesting was that a masters degree will (statistically) always outperform a b.s, but a phd is closer to a 50/50 for outperforming a masters (they attribute this to being too specialized.

Everywhere you look is regulation - regulation encouraged home buying over rentals, taxes encouraged borrowing over equity, government sponsored enterprises underpriced/didnt evaluate risk, regulation increases the time it takes to fund and create new banks, and I've yet to see a convincing explanation of how the repeal of Glass-Steagall caused this mess in the first place.  I also don't get why government doesn't allow for some form of rapid bankruptcy to restructure balance sheets and wipe out shareholders and to some degree, bondholders.  I'm not sure why taxpayers and ""good"" innovative industries should be subsidizing bond holders and shareholders of businesses that didn't adequately plan for risk.

I said that Goldman was made whole by the US govt via AIG.  If other folks are losing money in similar circumstances, it's fair to ask why Goldman is being treated differently.<p>And, even if everyone is being made whole, the question remains - why should the US make them whole?  Why shouldn't they lose money for taking bad counter-party risks?  They were planning to keep the money that they made for assuming said risks, so why shouldn't they take the hit when things work out badly?<p>If I buy something that turns out to be worth less than I expected, I take the loss.  Why not Goldman and other banks?<p>> They got what they were owed, and the taxpayers got their 7.5 billion in collateral back.  If the taxpayers did not pay the 10 billion<p>I'll pay $7.5B for $10B.<p>> In either case, whether AIG was allowed to fail or not, they would have been made whole.<p>Maybe, maybe not, but in any event, not by the US govt.",1239922608

566043,comment,565545,565998,0,0,rcoder,,,"Using a default configuration, Apache actually maintains a pool of worker child processes which handle the actual request processing, rather than forking on every incoming request. You can allow it to fork more workers under load, or keep it locked down to manage resource usage. You can also configure it to use an alternate MPM (Multi-Processing Module) to use thread pools, fork on each request, or some mix of the above.<p>The difference in resource usage is due more to the fact that Apache is written to be a sort of generic network service platform, rather than a lean-and-mean HTTP server. It allows plug-in modules (whether written in C, or any of the mod_perl/python/ruby/etc. dynamic language bindings) to interact with just about any stage of request processing. In addition, a default Apache install will usually link a large number of other modules in each worker<p>That being said, tuning Apache for performance + minimal resource usage is a bit of a black art.

As attractive as 110- to 220-mile-per-hour trains might sound, even the most optimistic forecasts predict they will take fewcars off the road. At best, they will replace for profit private commuter airlines with heavily subsidized public rail systems that are likely to require continued subsidies far into the future.<p>Nor are high-speed rail lines particularly environmentally friendly. Planners have predicted that a proposed line in Florida would use more energy and emit more of some pollutants than all of the cars it would take off the road. California planners forecast that high-speed rail would reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by a mere 0.7 to1.5 percent—but only if ridership reached the high end of projected levels. Lower ridership would nullify energy savings and pollution reductions.<p>These assessments are confirmed by the actual experience of high-speed rail lines in Japan and Europe. Since Japan introduced high-speed bullet trains, passenger rail has lost more than half its market share to the automobile. Since Italy, France, and other European countries opened their high-speed rail lines, rail’s market share in Europe has dwindled from 8.2 to 5.8 percent of travel. If high-speed rail doesn’t work in Japan and Europe, how can it work in the United States?<p>As megaprojects—the California high-speed rail is projected to cost $33 to $37 billion—high-speed rail plans pose serious risks for taxpayers. Costs of recent rail projects in Denver and Seattle are running 60 to 100 percent above projections. Once construction begins, politicians will feel obligated to throw good taxpayers’ money after bad. Once projects are completed, most plans call for them to be turned over to private companies that will keep any operationalprofits, while taxpayerswill remain vulnerable if the trains lose money.<p>In short, high-speed rail proposals are high cost, high-risk megaprojects that promise little or no congestion relief, energy savings, or other environmental benefits.""<p>And with that, I'm going to get a pseudonym.

566012,comment,565206,565857,0,0,iuguy,,,"I'm going to discuss your comment in three parts. Thank god this isn't reddit as I'd probably follow up with a ""Your shit's all fucked up and you talk like a fag"" or a pun type post.<p>Your first assertion is that people who decry high IQs as the sole purviews of snotty brats is a combination of sour grapes and a biased sample. I can't speak based on a scientific sample of high IQ folk. I can only speak for myself and people I know. My IQ (in case you were wondering) is 167 according to SB5 testing (I was tested through most of my childhood and some of my early academic life) putting me in the fairly smart range. To provide a counterpoint, I'll quote Alfred Binet (the 'B' in SB5) and just say:<p>""The scale, properly speaking, does not permit the measure of intelligence, because intellectual qualities are not superposable, and therefore cannot be measured as linear surfaces are measured."" - Binet 1905.<p>There are snotty brats with low IQs. There are snotty brats with high IQs. Thus we can surmise that in any given sample of sufficient size regardless of IQ there are snotty brats. If you don't believe me I suggest you visit 4chan.org sometime.<p>Your second comment tries to pair correlation with reality. In some cases this works, in your example it doesn't as ""real intelligence"" is undefined, yet we are expected to accept that this undefined and unmeasured form of intelligence correlates with IQ. If you were to define what constitutes real intelligence then there's a point of discussion, but you must admit that your statement 'Whatever ""real intelligence"" is' implies that you don't know what it is - to be honest no-one does and that's the problem. An IQ score doesn't provide a measure of real intelligence, only problem solving within a measured subset of boundaries.<p>This then acts as a counterpoint for your third argument being that:<p>The science cannot be strong if ""real intelligence"" is less definable than ""Real Madrid"". Therefore I pose the counterpoint that correlation of an individual's success rate of ""Real Madrid"" (whatever ""success rate"" is) is more valid than correlation with ""Real intelligence"".<p>After all, ""Real Intelligence"" never won La Liga, the European cup, and so on, yet noone would ever argue against the genius of Real Madrid's European cup winning squads, no more than you could argue with the master strokes of Van Gogh or Raphael, nor the abilities of Newton - despite his inferior understanding of modern mathematics and logic, nor the ancient greeks despite their limitations.<p>One of the things I really appreciate about HN is that people have constructive arguments and disagreements. I completely accept that there's an element of fun in the topic I discussed (particularly about football teams) but I would like to say that although I don't agree with you, thanks for expressing your opinion and challenging mine. It's always good to have to rethink your worldview :)",1239920213

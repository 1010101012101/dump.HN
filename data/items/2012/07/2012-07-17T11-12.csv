I'm not implying that she wouldn't be a good fit and very capable at many jobs or positions.  But Yahoo!'s days are becoming numbered.  When I think about what she could have possibly experienced at Google versus what Yahoo! needs as a company (which is a corporate and strategic overhaul),  I can't understand where she'd have obtained anything remotely like ""turn-around"" expertise.  Yahoo! is going to require some outside-the-box thinking, and this hiring is about as inside-the-box as it could be (along with every other name you mentioned would have been).<p>But this is just one man's opinion.  I hope she can pull it off; it'd be a great story.<p>><i>""You can't just stick a ""turnaround expert"" in the shoes of Yahoo CEO and expect a great result.

By the end of a couple of courses it should be a very interesting project. It currently additionally allows for searching and note taking but I noticed when I go over my notes I tend to go back and forth on certain concepts so I will implement a history concept and automatic topic map building (using both cookie trails and measures of similarity).

The new HTML5 version runs with smooth 60fps, which is almost impossible to achieve 
with the Flash plugin!""<p>>> This is the kind of sentiment that shits me. Flash is measured by the worst of its developers.<p>>> Flash is capped at 60fps in the browser so as to limit the carnage, but can run at 120+ on the desktop. If the dude can't get his example game running at 60 fps in flash it's because he sucks, not the plugin. /rant<p>As far as I understand it, the API[0] author highlighted that the HTML5 port was consistently over 60fps (or constantly at 60fps if capped), whereas the Flash version was consistently under 60fps, and not even reaching the limit, hence no 60fps capping could be coming into play.<p>> Similarly, be prepared for a slew of super slow ""HTML5"" apps.<p>Inevitably, bad code will come.

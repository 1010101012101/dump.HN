7086449,comment,7084687,7084687,6,0,pea,,,"We have been based and fundraised in SV and LDN and my experiences are the following:<p>Hiring: \n* Engineers in the UK are amazing, and you can hire from mainland Europe, which is also very good.\n* Retention rates are higher.\n* Salaries are lower.\n* Most decent start-up-orientated talent is at the under-25 level. Finding good PMs with big vision is harder, and if you do, encouraging them to leave for a start-up is less heard of. In a sense, you have to &#x27;grow your own&#x27;.\n* Engineers traditionally have come from more corporate / tech-consulting backgrounds than start-up ones; this has both its pluses and its minuses. \n* Engineers in mainland Europe, and to a lesser extent London, will have more experience with older technology (C++, java) than newer technologies. That said, there are great developers for clojure/scala/python/ruby, but -- again -- they tend to be at a more junior level.<p>Fundraising: \n* The good people in London are really good, but there are a lot less of them.\n* Seed rounds are not significantly harder (due to SEIS and lots of hnws.) Crunch, I believe, comes at A, B, where there are only a handful of options (Index, Accel, Balderton, Wellington). This is when people look across the pond. Ironically, London is full of PE and massive funds (property, hedge funds, etc.) I assume some of this money will divert to tech in the future.\n* For seed rounds, you may have some discount price-wise, but, then again, it is a lot cheaper to run a company in the UK. I don&#x27;t believe this discount is that high or particularly relevant.\n* Investors are more inclined to want revenue, and focus on minimizing downside instead of maximizing upside; IMO it is harder to fund very big, disruptive ideas vs. smaller, cash-generative ones. There are outliers who are exceptions to this.\n* Things seem to be changing. Lots of &#x27;US-style&#x27; firms are springing up, but mostly at the seed level.\n* There is a tradition of doing seed as equity rounds instead of convertible debt. This is a massive headache, but people aren&#x27;t used to debt like in SV.\n* Most VCs have been bankers / consultants instead of entrepreneurs.",1390172336

7086439,comment,7085825,7085825,6,0,dangrossman,,,"Not that I know of, but Musk wasn&#x27;t part of PayPal at the beginning. He was off using the millions and VC connections he had from building and selling Zip2 to AltaVista/Compaq to start X.com, his own online banking company. Its early investors included banks; they were onboard from the start.<p>PayPal started as Confinity with Levchin/Thiel/Nosek/Howery and had its own set of finance industry investors. Thiel was from finance himself, so he&#x27;s probably the source of their early connections.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 2 years after PayPal was founded that it was acquired by Musk&#x27;s X.com, and the merged company kept the PayPal brand. Immediately after the acquisition, they raised another $100 million with investors including Deutsche Bank, Vertex and Development Bank of Singapore and JP Morgan.<p>I don&#x27;t share the same assumption that banks would be especially hesitant to process transactions for a well-funded tech company in 1999, though. I think the fact that they were investing in these companies readily is evidence otherwise.

I also knew a lot of people back in Cleveland who were living the workaholic life, trying to get into the best colleges, and so forth.  So that they could leave Cleveland behind.  It&#x27;s a state of mind, not a place.<p>I realize this may not be a popular point of view among San Franciscans, but I think the east bay and south bay are actually better if you don&#x27;t want to be a workaholic.  In SF, unless you bought property in the 1970s, you&#x27;ll be paying somewhere north of $3500 a month for housing.  That kind of money requires you to have a high-end job it sounds like you&#x27;re not that interested in.  There are benefits to living in SF, but they come with costs.<p>A lot of artists and creatives live in Oakland these days.  It has good access to San Francisco and other places via BART, and the housing costs are still reasonable.<p>On the other hand, the most laid-back place in the bay area is definitely Santa Cruz.

That may be true if you consider bitcoin by itself but I think it&#x27;s important to look at the whole landscape of crypto-currencies. Consider the following:<p>I buy a bitcoin, I send it to BTC-e.com and sell it for $800. Now I have an $800 USD balance on my account. I wait for 4 days then buy Litecoin and send it to my offline wallet.<p>Now, how would you track that? Note in my HN profile I have a BTC & LTC address that I&#x27;ve done exactly that with more than once. I would love for someone to show me the blockchain transactions that prove that&#x27;s what happened. Alos note, this is pretty much how the SheepMarketPlace thieves got away. Some guy tracing the bitcoins until it was revealed that he was just following a BTC-e.com&#x27;s internal operations address. Also note that you don&#x27;t need to give BTC-e.com anymore more info than a valid email-address. Just get your coins from some other place like mining or whatever, send them to the deposit-address given to you on BTC-e.com.<p>For people not familar with bitcoin, consider this real-world example. I steal a $100 bill from your wallet but you have a paper-thin tracking device inside it. So you watch it physically move around in the world. Now, if I go to an Airport and exchange the $100 for 89 EURO... you&#x27;ve lost track of the original thief. The thief still is holding the funds he gained from the theft and you&#x27;re just following a $100 around in the Airport exchange system that may end up anywhere. You know where the $100 bill is but you&#x27;ll never find the thief.

So instead of writing:<p><pre><code>    (exec (where* (select* people) `(> :age 18)))\n</code></pre>\nOne can instead write:<p><pre><code>    (select people (where (> :age 18)))\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an extremely simple transformation, and can be expressed in a few lines of code.<p>There are some libraries, such as core.async or core.logic, that make more extensive use of macros, but these libraries are relatively rare, and take a lot of work to get right.

So you&#x27;re probably lucky if you&#x27;re getting 1.25 or 1.5 times more done by working twice as many hours, and sometimes your total productivity will even decline.<p>For example, after 50 hours, a developer might be coding more bugs that they&#x27;ll have to spend time fixing the next day. If it takes longer to fix the bug than it did to write that code, the productivity of the time spent writing the code will have been negative - you would have been better off going home and getting some sleep.",1390169599

Wealth is created, and if you can create a billion dollars in wealth, then so be it.<p><i>Even if so, is it right that you can be a billionaire while there are more empty homes each night in the US than the homeless population?</i><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;right&quot;.  Is that a troubling, even disturbing situation? Yes, I would find it to be so.  But is any particular billionaire (or any other particular individual at all) somehow <i>obligated</i> to fix the homelessness problem? No.<p><i>Is it right that you can safely eat anything you like while others have to make sacrifices and choices because of political cuts to SNAP? The answer is clearly no.</i><p>I would disagree, again with the caveat that it depends on what you mean by &quot;right&quot;.  I think I would rank that situation as &quot;unfortunate&quot;, and I think we all wish the rich would do more to help the less fortunate. I know when I was dirt-poor, living below the poverty line, I resented the rich a bit, so I get this mindset.  But as I&#x27;ve moved through life and seen what hard-work and determination can accomplish, and become more comfortable in my own skin, I find that I no longer cherish the idea of handouts greatly, except for the real edge cases:  People who literally cannot fend for themselves - the elderly, children, people who are physically or mentally disabled, etc.<p><i>In this way, pursuing money for wealth&#x27;s sake is unethical.</i><p>I guess this also depends on how you define unethical.  Is a really rich person who does nothing to help the less fortunate a huge asshole?  Arguably, yes.  But is that the same thing as behaving unethically?  I wouldn&#x27;t say so.

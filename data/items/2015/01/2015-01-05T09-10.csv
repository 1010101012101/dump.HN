- How do people have time to fetch and read content everyday?
- Are those currators mostly students?
- Is it possible for a non-american interest content to reach top articles (eg. in the Newsletter)? By that I mean making a linear regression on the localization of the voters.<p>Please prove me wrong on those!<p>Or maybe it is only christmas break that made it a student-ish edition...",1420451962

8838023,comment,8836271,8836271,0,0,zcrar70,,,"The easiest form of investment to get started with are investment funds (aka mutual funds in the US). They are a form of collective investment (i.e. you invest along with other people in a basket of goods, rather than a single share). The advantage of this is lower cost (buying and selling shares has a cost, with a fund there are economies of scale so it&#x27;s usually cheaper to invest via a fund than directly in a similar basket of shares), and generally lower risk (if a company that the fund invested in goes bust, you usually lose less money than if you invest in the company directly, because the fund invests in many different companies whereas you&#x27;d usually invest in a smaller number of stocks).<p>ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and Investment Trusts are similar to investment funds in that they are also collectives, relatively low cost. The current fashion in investing is to buy &#x27;passive&#x27;, &#x27;tracker&#x27; or &#x27;index&#x27; funds (or ETFs), which all follow an index such as the FTSE or S&P. These tend to be lower cost than &#x27;actively managed&#x27; funds (where the fund manager tries to beat the index). Vanguard is a popular &#x27;passive&#x27; fund manager.<p>Other types of investments include property (you generally need quite a lot of capital), and more risky types of investment such as forex trading, spread betting, etc. Even experienced investors tend to consider these risky.<p>Investments have done reasonably well over the past year in some areas (some UK income funds are up 8% in the past 12 months), not so well in others (a FTSE All Share tracker is only up 0.6% over the year). Investing is not risk-free, and generally speaking there is no guarantee to make a profit. You could also consider saving in cash, but with interest rates as they are now, you&#x27;d probably be worse off in real terms by the end of the year than you were at the beginning (because interest rates are generally lower than inflation)<p>Some investment brokers in the UK include: rplan (disclosure: I work for rplan), Hargreaves Lansdown (the largest), Fidelity, Nutmeg (another startup).<p>As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s definitely worth doing a bit of research to find out more about how things work. If you don&#x27;t mind the shameless plug, we have a &#x27;guide to investing&#x27; available on our site which we think is quite a good overview of what&#x27;s available (it&#x27;s fairly UK-specific though): <a href=""https://www.rplan.co.uk/investment-guide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rplan.co.uk/investment-guide</a> (note: registration required, let me know if you&#x27;d rather not register and I can send you a copy).",1420450429

Perhaps entering a duration in minutes and seconds and using arrow keys to shift the buffer bar location left/right until the correct scene is found, or searching for known dialog text and mapping transcript to location in the video that that specific part of the transcript was said in dialog might be a useful addition to the already-available &quot;thumbnail search&quot; most video players provide today (when you hover over the loading bar, a thumbnail image of that scene appears in a tooltip).<p>Something useful I&#x27;ve seen in very few places are video players that maintain a history of the duration of the video that was watched, so if the internet ever cuts out or the video stops loading the page could just be reloaded and the duration in the video will be maintained, albeit 1 minute prior just as a quick recap of what happened. When this feature is not available, and the connection is shoddy, watching videos can be very frustrating because having to find where you were previously can sometimes take ages, especially if the loading bar has no indication of what duration in minutes the video is at the location you hover your mouse on the loading bar.<p>What else other than this could add any real value to the act of searching a video? Perhaps mapping words to visual cues, for example searching &quot;helicopter explosion&quot; would take you directly to an overdramatic scene of a helicopter being blown up in magnificent ember by a missile that is clearly too small to do much damage to a bicycle let alone a helicopter, that would be cool.",1420448742

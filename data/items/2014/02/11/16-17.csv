Many of these issues have parallels to the American federal vs. state&#x27;s rights debates. Early on, the U.S. was much more individual state-centric. Outside of slavery, the American civil war was largely about individual Southern states keeping their local rights vs. a more federal North. Over time the major political parties have largely separated on this issue with the American Left more federal and the Right more interested in state rights.<p>Lots of the befuddlement non-Americans feel towards sometimes arcane, mixed &quot;American&quot; policy (e.g. taxes, guns, gay rights, etc.) is a result of this.<p>Regardless, the US model has quickly moved towards a more national policy even though it&#x27;s still a very active debate here.<p>The EU is a grand experiment, but long histories and complex cultural differences and interactions will make it very interesting to watch how it plays out.",1392137713

So many schools (even the &#x27;top&#x27; ones) turn out people that cannot do this, and I find it appalling. These things are foundational, they are not vocational. Unfortunately that does in fact meaning having to learn some tools which will become obsolete. So what? I did EE labs, and while resistors are the same none of the digital components really are. I learned how to design NPN junctions, which are now largely replaced with CMOS, but so what? It was the experience that mattered. You can&#x27;t hand wave that away (&#x27;you&#x27; is global, not you mandor), teach the math of junction biases, and expect that anyone will be able to do anything with it once they graduate. But so many CS programs try to do exactly that. I walked out of undergrad knowing how to do recurrence relations, prove the complexity of graph algorithms, and so on, but with almost no clue about how to actually design an algorithm, how to structure and design software, and so on. It took grad school and some good teaching professors, to change that.<p>I&#x27;ve rewritten this three times or so - it is hard to address without sounding like I&#x27;m attacking you, which I am not. But I am truly dismayed about the skill sets of people graduating from CS programs. I&#x27;m not asking for Java vocational training, but for a recognition that 99% of the graduates will be asked to function as &quot;engineers&quot;, not &quot;scientists&quot;. The people that come out and that function well seem to do so despite the schooling, not because of it.<p>Incidentally, the best EE teacher, or any teacher, that I ever had, had worked in industry for many years, decided he wanted to teach, and went into teaching. His classes were practical and pragmatic. Oh, you were failing if you didn&#x27;t master the math and theory behind the material, but he taught you how to design, how to think, how to manipulate all of this book learned stuff to make real things that worked. We had to cost out our projects, write design reports, and so on. Extremely hard courses, but absolutely fantastic, because of, not despite, the focus on what might be called &#x27;pointless&#x27; things (who cares what the cost of a transistor was in 1986, after all?!)<p>Unfortunately, you cannot gain experience, and develop the process, without using tools. It needs to be part of the education. Just look at the post by the poor person you are responding to. Think of how much better his entire education would have been if in some freshman level lab he had been taught some of these basics. I shudder to think how much he probably spent for that education vs what he got.",1392136455

Or just wash everything twice, which wastes far more water than just doing it correctly the first time.<p>Its always easier to ship something that meets the numbers but doesn&#x27;t actually work, than to ship something that both meets the numbers and works.  Therefore you have to do a lot of programming every time you boot up, to prevent &quot;save the planet&quot;.<p>Eventually we&#x27;ll need to flash the eeproms to get some super greenwashed appliance to actually work.  But for now, the UI involves a lot of &quot;useless&quot; reconfiguration on every boot.<p>Aside from the washer, both the dryer and the dishwasher and the fridge and the thermostat are greenwashed out of the box and need reprogramming to actually work.  The fridge wanted to greenly keep my food at like 55F until reconfigured away from green mode, now it works fine.",1392134704

Of course Laplace transforms would be taught in the second half.  The few students who already knew the transform or somehow knew to read, ahead did well.  I spent 20 minutes on one problem solving the differential equations from scratch without the damn transform.  I felt sorry for those who weren&#x27;t taking it as a freshman (it was pass/fail for all classes your first year at MIT).<p>That guy was a useless jerk. (As a teacher.) I did have professors that were useful jerks ... Difficult homework every single class with spot on directed feedback by the very next class.  Unfortunately teaching well at a research university is just a mark of being eccentric. It seems to be negatively correlated with getting tenure.  The &#x27;useful jerk&#x27; already had tenure.

Healthcare is by it&#x27;s nature a social issue as well as an economic issue. And a draining of doctors in the USA would have a devastating effect on general health.<p>Even more important is pointing out that medicine is already not a perfect capitalist economy. Insurance companies negotiate crazy deals with hospitals and doctors to avoid paying out, and the hospitals and docs are driven to post prices as high as humanly possible because the insurers are so ruthless in undercutting every single expense. What would Ayn Rand have made of a world where generic Advil in a hospital setting cost 1000% of what the drug store is charging? That&#x27;s not a Smith economy. That&#x27;s a gross perversion of free economics.<p>That&#x27;s the snake eating it&#x27;s tail on the other end of price control. $25 per pill for pain killers [1]?

7218199,comment,7215834,7216475,5,0,hetman,,,"There&#x27;s a bit of similarity to Polish here. While a lot of other languages in the region (including ones that are closely related) use the plural &quot;you&quot; as a formal address, this sounds quite unrefined in Polish (or like a Soviet holdover). And addressing a superior/stranger with the singular &quot;you&quot; is completely out of the question.<p>That means, just life in Sinhalese, it is correct to address the individual in the third person with the most appropriate title (and falling back on Sir/Madam when the title isn&#x27;t known). E.g. &quot;Could Sir help me find the nearest bus stop&quot;, etc. (The Polish for Sir/Madam here is the same as Lord/Lady).<p>In other circumstances things tend not to be as strict. For example among equals of lower social rank (e.g. younger people), often singular grammatically implicit &quot;you&quot; can suffice. Or, when addressing one&#x27;s closer superior kin, you would be only partially formal, for example: &quot;Could [you] o mother, pass the salt&quot;. This example does not translate very well into English. It helps that Polish verbs carry the information about the pronoun of the person being addressed as part of their grammar (e.g. &quot;I eat&quot; = &quot;jem&quot;, &quot;you [singular] eat&quot; = &quot;jesz&quot;, &quot;we eat&quot; = &quot;jemy&quot;, &quot;they eat&quot; = &quot;jedzą&quot;, etc). The personal pronoun can be used explicitly for additional emphasis, but in some circumstances using an explicit singular &quot;you&quot; can be considered less polite (like pointing you finger).<p>There are other quirks when some level of familiarity is attained (and thus the formality can be reduced). In such a circumstance for example, to say &quot;Could you pass the book?&quot;, one could say &quot;Let it be that Sir passes the book&quot;, or even less formally, &quot;Sir will pass the book.&quot; It sounds impolite when translated into English because in Polish, familiarity/closeness is expressed by an assumption of the other party&#x27;s willingness to help.",1392134418

Sure.<p>But my goal isn't to get the purest possible level of security; it's to get normal people to use something more complex than the 8-14 character passwords they generally use now.

I'm mediocre to bad.<p>I'd love to pay someone competent to do it.<p>Pricing:<p>What I really want to pay for is service and training. We are on a Dreamhost VPS right now. It's fine for our needs and I can manage it ok, but I've come across different problems that I wish there was a guru around to show me how to solve it. I've spent a ton of time with different problems, some that I've been able to solve, others that I haven't. I'd be happy to pay for someone to walk me through how to do it.<p>The best pricing model (for me) would be a system that is configured by you initially, after you talk with me. You spend X hours creating policies for me (i.e. written documentation). You charge me a one-time fee for the consultation, set-up, and documentation.<p>We keep you on retainer for some monthly fee but all other service/training is on a per-job basis. It might be a little odd that I'd pay you for training; you'd be essentially working yourself out of a job. But I think that could justify a higher rate. It would also prevent people from abusing you to do things that they should be able to do themselves... OR they would rather pay you at your high rate to move files around. Win-win. There <i>are</i> a lot of people that don't care to learn about this stuff, so maybe you would have a different tiered pricing for that type of service.<p>What you /shouldn't/ offer is an actual hosting setup. I know there are some tricky questions regarding how you can get access to the system if you don't host it (you'll have to come up with a reasonable policy) but the hosting market is quite saturated (I think). It'd be difficult for you to offer a differentiated product since most people look at hosting as a commodity.<p>I think your product differentiator will come to service and training.

At today's rates, your mortgage payment will be ~$2,000/month. Your first payment on that house will be $600 principal and $1,400 interest. In a condo, your HOA fee will be maybe $800-1000/month. Depending on your tax bracket, your tax savings will be ~$400/month, which will cancel out your property taxes. So your total cost is $1,400 + $1,000 = $2,400. Market rent for the same 3BR high-rise condo is probably $2,500 to $3,000. Moreover, while your rent will go up 2-5% each year, the interest component of your mortgage payment will actually go down (2-3%/year over the first decade).

4447458,comment,4447408,4447408,19,0,creamyhorror,,,"Iluminating, exhaustive article and illustrated history of multitouch. I wonder how many of these papers, prototypes and devices the patent examiners came across when they were deciding on the prospective multitouch patent now owned by Apple. Money quote:<p>----<p><i>Multi-touch technologies have a long history.  To put it in perspective, my group at the University of Toronto was working on multi-touchin 1984 (Lee, Buxton & Smith, 1985), the same year that the first Macintosh computer was released, and we were not the first.  Furthermore, during the development of the iPhone, Apple was very much aware of the history of multi-touch, dating at least back to 1982, and the use of the pinch gesture, dating back to 1983.  This is clearly demonstrated by the bibliography of the PhD thesis of Wayne Westerman, co-founder of FingerWorks, a company that Apple acquired early in 2005, and now an Apple employee<p><pre><code>    Westerman, Wayne (1999). Hand Tracking,Finger Identification, and Chordic Manipulation on a Multi-Touch Surface. U of Delaware PhD Dissertation:  http://www.ee.udel.edu/~westerma/main.pdf\n</code></pre>\nIn making this statement about their awareness of past work, I am not criticizing Westerman, the iPhone, or Apple.  It is simply good practice and good scholarship to know the literature and do one's homework when embarking on a new product.  What I am pointing out, however, is that ""new"" technologies - like multi-touch - do not grow out of a vacuum.  While marketing tends to like the ""great invention"" story, real innovation rarely works that way.  In short, the evolution of multi-touch is a text-book example of what I call ""the long-nose of innovation.""</i><p>----<p>Interesting examples relating to pinch-to-zoom:<p>[o] 1983: Video Place / Video Desk (Myron Krueger)<p>His use of many of the hand gestures that are now starting to emerge can be clearly seen in the following 1988 video, including using the pinch gesture to scale and translate objects:  <a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=dmmxVA5xhuo</a><p>[o] 1991: Digital Desk(Pierre Wellner,  Rank Xerox EuroPARC, Cambridge)<p>Clearly demonstrated multi-touch concepts such as two finger scaling and translation of graphical objects, using either a pinching gesture or a finger from each hand, among other things.<p>This page makes it quite clear how improvements in this subfield of tech, like in many other fields, are evolutionary and build upon existing ideas in the literature. Many potential implementations have been proposed and experimented with. What role do patents play in this picture? What is the breadth of Apple's pinch-to-zoom patent - how far does it extend beyond smartphones? Are any of these devices close enough to the patent to legally count as prior art?<p>Thanks for this great submission.

Ideas are not everything  execution is key\n2. It is extremely important to solve a problem that people would find value in, and therefore pay for.<p>Summary: It is of course important to execute well and solve the problem, but the starting point is to know if the problem is worth getting solved.<p>Now look at our education system through this new prism the flaw comes out very, very clearly the system today teaches problem solving, applying theory to practice etc but there is little to no emphasis on identifying problems. Think about your own school / college days for a second in how many instances were you given a situation, and were asked to identify problems to solve?<p>The problem to be solved was always STATED nobody ever asked us to come up with a set of difficult problems to solve.<p>Over time, this lack of practice in identifying problems translates into difficulties in spotting profitable opportunities. Even if we do, there is a lack\nof conviction and we end up pivoting multiple times.<p>Our education system cultivates employees, not employers  to be one, you need to be trained not to solve a problem, but to identify one.<p>For some reason HN would not allow me to submit the link for the above, it kept killing the post and any related query.

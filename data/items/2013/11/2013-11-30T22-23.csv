6825059,comment,6808744,6813378,1,0,AlgoBLAH,,,">Reminds me of music created by some aleatoric process (Cage&#x27;s I Ching stuff, perhaps). Interesting to think about...<p>It probably wouldn&#x27;t come with any surprise that I favor Harry Partch over Cage as far as modern American iconoclast composers go.. :)<p>>It feels, though, that the practitioners are prone to getting caught up in the pseudo-novelty (novel, at least, to them) of how it is done at the expense of creating music that presents some engaging development arc.<p>Indeed, this is the crux of the matter / critique as that was very apparent from the get go of the live coding (LC) movement. I think LC is a tool which can be useful at times for exploring different sounds, but is not well suited as a performance mechanism. There is no or little apparent composition process involved in what I have seen over 10 years of LC. The mechanism in itself does not make lasting art, but if used at bare minimum via the process of selection as part of a larger compositional process it is valid. I&#x27;m sure somewhere in the LC community this is happening, but it certainly isn&#x27;t how the status quo operates or how LC is presented at large.<p>In regard to TOPLAP et al; if you need to lead a &quot;movement&quot; with a manifesto to justify the musical output you&#x27;re doing it wrong... Or in other words this movement like many before with leanings toward the avant-garde does not address that at the end of the day it&#x27;s a handful of folks performing for other LC aficionados and no one else. One shouldn&#x27;t need to buy into the manifesto to appreciate LC as art.<p>In many ways by elevating LC to &quot;movement status&quot; it can capture and beguile a generation of computer musicians including HN readers who are new to computer music concepts & generative / algorithmic music. It&#x27;s not the only game in town so to speak though I do have general respect for the immediatism aspect of LC as far as it aligns with the mechanism and performance in regard to just getting out there and &quot;doing it&quot;.<p>My experience and lifes work on the coding / performance side could be considered an antithesis to the LC movement; it&#x27;s been a solo journey for me so far. My work has not been released yet though I may have been one of the first to build an alternative client / framework for SuperCollider (&#x27;02). It all started there and work continues today though it&#x27;s branched beyond solely music / audio control, but I do hope to get back to music / performance applications and heck performing once the larger effort is released (and shock / gasp perhaps I&#x27;ll make income to support the art side of things and future music-tech efforts).",1385852286

6825052,comment,6823973,6824601,8,0,lsc,,,">I think however larger rack/frame mounted DC/DC converters would likely be even more efficient than per chassis DC/DC converters, but would require almost totally custom hardware.<p>Nope, you can buy off the shelf ATX PSUs that accept 48v DC as input, though it&#x27;s kinda hard to find.  It&#x27;s easier to find, usually, on the higher-end.<p>For switching gear, though?  it&#x27;s a standard option, as 48v DC is standard for telcos.<p>In fact, most of the higher-end datacenters will sell you 48v DC if you ask for it.   It&#x27;s sort of like having an always-online UPS, as they can just leave the battery-banks in-line;  no switching from mains power to UPS required.   (and that switch is... quite often what fails when a data center loses power.)  Whenever I take folks through my setup at coresite santa clara, they are always drawn to the 48vdc battery bank on the other side of the room. &quot;Hey guys, that&#x27;s not mine.&quot;   &quot;No, don&#x27;t touch that giant copper bus bar.&quot;<p>(That&#x27;s the thing about low voltage; you need serious amounts of copper if you want to move very many watts at all.)<p>It used to be a bigger deal than it is now, as the PSU in your server is dramatically better now than it was even just ten years ago.<p>But yeah, from what I can tell?   (and I spend what, 10x rent on data-center power?  I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m an expert, but I certainly have an incentive to be right.)  The negotiation differences between the cost per watt using different voltages is far greater than the efficiency differences of different voltages.  Sales people ruin everything.<p>At many places, 208v cost you twice as much per amp as 120v, so you are better off just buying twice as many 120v amps.   (I mean, 208v is more efficient for you and for the datacenter, but it&#x27;s not 10% more efficient, and you get more than 10% more watts that way.)<p>I was at one place where an amp of 208v was only about 30% more expensive than an amp of 120v.   Too bad that free ride ended.<p>The problem is that most salespeople don&#x27;t really understand any of this... they understand how to sell.  And a 10% difference in power cost, well, that&#x27;s less than the referral bonus they give if you have an agreement to feed them leads.    (this is why you see so many small companies claiming to have datacenters across the country.   They just have referral programs, and they get upwards of 10% of what the customer ends up paying the real data center, essentially in exchange for some slimy seo.)<p>So really, the negotiation game matters a whole lot more than what is actually the most efficient, until you get to the point where you can build your own data-center.",1385852186
6825051,comment,6823361,6824282,4,0,SilasX,,,"Unfortunately, the theory of tax/cost incidence shows what can go wrong with this: since it results in above-market effective wages, that simply intensifies the competition for those positions, probably to the point that workers will offer to do them for less than the current wage Amazon is paying, since they know they&#x27;ll still make the same from such donations.<p>Here&#x27;s a discussion that covered the question in the context of allowing people to tip McDonald&#x27;s cashiers directly, but the same analysis applies:<p><a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/08/what_if_tipping_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/08/what_if_tipping_...</a><p>&quot;Who benefits&quot; is determined by the shape of the supply/demand curves, not who is being handed the dollars.",1385852145

It&#x27;s always been unsupported and not worked in specific situations, but for 99% of code it appeared to GCC users that it was supported.  The signed integer overflow behaviour was never guaranteed by old versions of GCC, and code exploiting it would not always be compiled with the &quot;expected&quot; behaviour.  It&#x27;s just as the GCC optimizer has improved there are more circumstances when it does optimisations that hinge on the assumption.<p>Compiler users generally want something that &quot;just works&quot; and doesn&#x27;t do anything unexpected, but in the case of a low-level language like C, doing away with undefined behavior essentially would mean pessimistically avoiding many optimisations on the 99%+ of straightforward, reasonable code out there in favor of not doing anything surprising on the remaining fraction of dubious code that depends on certain things happening in scenarios where behavior is undefined according to the C standard.

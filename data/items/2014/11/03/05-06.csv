Go ahead and try collecting regular currency for a charity of your choice without ever getting sign off from that charity and only ever giving them the proceeds if they ask. It will end very badly for you.<p>> You can declare tips as income, no problem.<p>No, there are a lot of potential problems that stem from this. In particular, it raises lots of flags about whether those tips are accurate, whether it is some form of money laundering, and whether they are really tips or something more nefarious. Unlike in the US, in a lot of other 1st world countries, handling taxes is incredibly straightforward (less than an hour of your time a year and zero risk of liability), but once you throw tips in to the equation now it&#x27;s as difficult as it is for many people in the US.<p>> So he has a generalised feeling that Bitcoin is bad because it&#x27;s popular and has vocal fans, and that regulation is good yet also complicated, so anything which seems simple must be unregulated and therefore bad.<p>No, he&#x27;s pointing out that its vocal fans have a distorted perspective and often don&#x27;t really buy in to its virtues... but those problems are not why Bitcoin is a terrible currency.",1414994392
8549520,comment,8544796,8545992,0,0,authatheist,,,"You&#x27;re not addressing my post, where I tried to highlight the silliness of your earlier claims.<p>How does consumption &quot;have to&quot; match production? How do you figure &quot;money has no value&quot;? Now you&#x27;re talking about &quot;intrinsic value&quot; but earlier it was just plain &quot;value&quot;.<p>People save money for a reason you know. If money has no value, as you originally claimed, then there&#x27;s no reason to save or possess it. If money has no &quot;intrinsic value&quot; that doesn&#x27;t make your original claim any less confused.<p>But to be precise, value is purely subjective. We&#x27;ve been using the word somewhat ambiguously. Value is utility as a means towards an end. Money, as a medium of exchange, has utility as a means towards countless ends, and that&#x27;s exactly why everyone wants it.<p>You say people have a disincentive to invest because it&#x27;s risky, but I don&#x27;t see a point there. It all depends on the investment opportunity, and the investor&#x27;s tolerance to risk etc, ie. the circumstances. Some people do invest, some don&#x27;t. So what?<p>You say that not investing doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve any consumption problems&quot;, but what the hell might those be? Again, why does consumption &quot;have to&quot; match production? What does that mean? What&#x27;s a &quot;consumption problem&quot; and whose problem is it, and why?<p>Why is (price-)deflation a problem, considering it means our purchasing power is increasing? Do you really want to claim people want <i>less</i> stuff for their money?<p>Don&#x27;t pretend you&#x27;re giving me an economics lesson.",1414994332

There simply isn&#x27;t an answer out there, which is what makes it fun, in my opinion.<p>(Full disclosure: I skimmed your post, but the advice I&#x27;ll give you is universal.)<p>- Look for someone mature and experienced. You said you gravitated to the college student. I strongly recommend against that. You want someone who has built a ton of products like yours before and can iterate fast. You also want someone with real success stories on their resume who can act as a strong source of wisdom. Always try to partner with someone from whom you can learn a lot.<p>- Having lots of time is incredibly important. If your product isn&#x27;t her top priority, your CTO is going to become your bottleneck. You want someone who can go without a salary until you (ideally) make money or (less ideally) raise money.<p>- This is minor, but stop calling the person a CTO. Until you have lots of employees, you&#x27;re not chiefs of anything. You&#x27;re looking for a technical partner or technical co-founder.<p>- What is your product? Come up with a vision and plan for MVP, and then recruit a technical co-founder. A lot of the best technical people are drawn to the vision, as well as access to an interesting market. They don&#x27;t care much about money. If they wanted it that much, they&#x27;d work for one of the large tech companies.",1414993932

I think it is this overly nationalist view of economics that needs to die, not &quot;capitalism&quot;.<p>There is not less productive work to go around, it&#x27;s just not being done in the US. We are in a difficult situation because we have free trade with lower cost labor markets. Until labor market costs in free trade enclaves reach equilibrium, capitalism will continue to raise more people out of poverty, and prevent wages from rising in places where they are above the demand level in the global market.<p>The extraordinary amount of government debt being created is an interesting phenomenon, as it is failing to cause inflation in most large currencies as they are increasing the money quantities in a correlated fashion. The financial entities are spending a lot of energy pricing these various instruments, and can make low risk money on the spreads.<p>Japan did have a real estate bubble. The thing about bubbles is not &quot;coming back&quot;, it&#x27;s that the wealth wasn&#x27;t real in the first place. We weren&#x27;t as rich as we thought we were. Their problem is demographics, an aging population, low birth rate, and a society that is not practiced at encouraging positive immigration.<p>&quot;What capitalism gives us by default is a small number of rich people and a large number of poor people competing for a shrinking pool of low-paying jobs.&quot; This is just wrong in every way...the number of rich people in the world is growing, the number of jobs in the world is growing.

In all likelihood, James Comey is genuinely worried about public safety.<p>Think about this from his point of view. As head of the FBI, his days are inundated with threats.

Figure out what you&#x27;re good at and focus on it. Don&#x27;t mention spreadsheets. This looks like you pasted your resume, and resumes suck at getting attention, holding attention, and making you stand out. They&#x27;re a terrible marketing tool.<p>- Take out the jargon. Use real, human language, especially somewhere like HN. (Side note: I can&#x27;t imagine what &quot;best practices&quot; for QAing video products might be or why I need them. Try to be specific and concrete.)<p>- Tell us what your skills are. What can my company do with you on the team that it can&#x27;t do now? Tell us about what other companies have accomplished that were only possible because of you. If you can&#x27;t do that, you&#x27;re not a superhero, and you should change your pitch.<p>- Appeal to our problems. A pitch for an interview isn&#x27;t about you. It&#x27;s about us. Tell us what problems you&#x27;ll solve for us. A lot of people on here feel like marketing is fluffy, time-wasting, and difficult. Tell them how you&#x27;re going to make those feelings go away and decrease their costs of customer acquisition.<p>- Finally, be very persistent (you may already be doing this). You often feel totally hopeless right before you find something awesome. Always follow up after a rejection and find out why you didn&#x27;t get the job, no matter how awkward or painful it&#x27;s going to be. You&#x27;ll never learn what to fix if you don&#x27;t ask, and the interviewer will be impressed.",1414992941

He wasn&#x27;t charged with organized crime, but I don&#x27;t think you could argue he wasn&#x27;t jailed for it. Conversely (although that may be the wrong operation) and by design, you can do a Wrong Thing and not be jailed because it&#x27;s a new Wrong Thing and thus there&#x27;s no law against it - there&#x27;s actually a technical term for this, and AFAIK it&#x27;s one of the basic principles of our judicial system.<p>> Not viable...<p>I think you&#x27;re reading in that I think we shouldn&#x27;t have bailed out those institutions, since you&#x27;re using examples with emotional impact.<p>And actually, there may be an interesting correlation here... What do you think of the &quot;Right to Die&quot;? To continue with the medical analogies, if you have someone in a vegetative state (for the purposes of the analogy, they are no longer a viable person), you don&#x27;t pull them off life support immediately, because it IS about more than just them. But you do let them die, eventually.<p>So let&#x27;s say you have this retirement and mutual fund that has - by virtue of a CONTINUED need for financial life support - demonstrated that it has entered a zombie state. Well, if you consider the invested funds as the organism&#x27;s energy... redistribute that energy to new organisms (aka, break up the company). Energy still exists, energy is still invested - and yes, of course I&#x27;m simplifying this and it could be non-feasible due to the effort involved in that break-up, but the idea remains.<p>> Where all those...<p>...Protesting? :D\nJoking aside, well - again, that energy isn&#x27;t lost. Where does it go? I&#x27;m very much not enough of an economist to say what circumstances money is actually destroyed, but... as Lewis CK put it: nothing&#x27;s on fire and nobody&#x27;s dead.<p>Now, want to say that energy doesn&#x27;t go someplace appropriate? We could go the angry route and say it&#x27;s going to the wall street bankers that caused the collapse, which in turn then looks like a whale eating krill. At some point the whale needs to die so there can be nourished krill, and the Cycle Continues, as they say.<p>I&#x27;m OK with more than old corporations dying but I don&#x27;t think   either of these positions have anything to nihilism.

8549423,comment,8548035,8548035,0,0,jvm,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of conflation in this article between distribution and economic growth, which I think arises from the Spiegel&#x27;s European perspective.<p>Going back to the start of the DAX tracking (mid-2011), we see okay performance in German DAX index, stagnation for the French CAC and British FTSE, and strong performance in the US S&P 500 and Japanese Nikkei. [1] Eurozone unemployment has soared into double digits of late, while in the US and Japan it is converging with the natural rate, <6%.<p>The economic situation in Europe is truly awful, in contrast to the US and Japan where growth has been respectable. But you would never have guessed this from the tone of the article.<p>The article raises a second narrative about inequality. Fair enough! But this is an orthogonal issue to Europe&#x27;s economic malaise. The US is infamous at not distributing the benefits of growth. In the US, we have one thing that&#x27;s working (growth) and one thing that&#x27;s not (inequality). This is due to many institutional problems and governance decisions and it will be a lot of work to improve the situation.<p>The thing I found alarming about this was the way they denigrated stimulus. This is an area of major divergence between Japan/US and Europe.  Nominal GDP growth, the measure of the &#x27;easiness&#x27; of money (it&#x27;s the sum of all money trading hands), has stagnated under the European Central Bank (ECB) while the US Fed (FOMC) has used stimulus to keep it growing in the United States [2]. If anyone believes the central banks have &quot;run out of ammunition&quot; as the article suggests, look what happened just last Friday in Japan: The BoJ announced unexpectedly high stimulus and the Nikkei instantly soared 4%, despite the fact that interest rates were already 0. [3]<p>The ECB needs to be <i>more</i> like the FOMC and BoJ. The Spiegel seems to think the opposite. It seems like the ECB&#x27;s policy reflects this hawkish European perspective. And that&#x27;s scary for Europe.<p>PS It&#x27;s true that Japan has been stagnating for decades. That is likely related to the ultratight monetary policy they&#x27;ve pursued since the early 90&#x27;s (as well as structural issues of course); NGDP actually shrunk there over 2 decades [4]. But they&#x27;ve been moving in a different direction lately, and the shift seems to be paying dividends.<p>[1] Drag the slider here back to mid-2011 to get a long-ish view: <a href=""https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chfdeh=0&chdet=1414991874560&chddm=890&cmpto=INDEXNIKKEI:NI225;INDEXSP:.INX;INDEXDB:DAX;INDEXEURO:PX1;INDEXFTSE:UKX&cmptdms=0;1;1;1;1&q=INDEXNIKKEI:NI225,INDEXSP:.INX,INDEXDB:DAX,INDEXEURO:PX1,INDEXFTSE:UKX&ntsp=0&ei=7Q9XVOjLE8_diQLFlYHwBQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chfdeh=0&chdet=141499...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/11/saupload_ngdp-ez-us.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.cdn-seekingalpha.com/uploads/2014/9/11/sauploa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/nikkei-japan-stimulus_n_6080146.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/31/nikkei-japan-stimul...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://uneasymoney.com/2012/02/13/japans-2-decade-experiment-with-fiscal-austerity-and-0-7-ngdp-growth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uneasymoney.com/2012/02/13/japans-2-decade-experiment...</a>",1414991668

If we can pull something off like in Ready Player One OASIS or even just more participating in buying digital goods I think this is part of the solution.<p>Another area I think can help is loans/investments but of digital currencies.  The world of funding could be revolutionized by bitcoin like systems where they are primarily for hoarding, but they are also perfect for supplying capital. Capital could be made available to the 99% out there in new interesting ways, shaking up baked in wealth of the 1% that is immovable at times of need.

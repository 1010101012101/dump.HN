How fast you execute buggy code is not a very interesting property, sequential consistency is expensive in lots of cases, and using weaker atomic is incredibly difficult (each time I think I know enough about weak atomics I found something that explain how various model are subtly weaker than I previously thought, not even talking about the fact that the C11/C++11 model is subtly formally unsound and compilers actually not formally respect it... so much if you try to prove some algorithms)",1453575540

10959499,comment,10959074,10959385,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"I think that what you describe is a good thing, when you look at the complete picture.<p>GBI could (should?) function, effectively, like a negative income tax -- below a certain income level the government pays you. Above that level, you earn nothing from the government, because you&#x27;re making more than some specific threshold already (probably at least 1.5x GBI, preferably higher [1]).<p>So yes, it would discourage people from going to a new country <i>for fun</i> and lounging around there and not working. People who want to move to a new country should do it because there&#x27;s a <i>job</i> for them in that new country, and if it doesn&#x27;t pay above the GBI threshold, then yes, they should probably stay home. If you&#x27;re a consultant who can work from anywhere, and you make more than the cutoff (which I would hope!), then GBI is similarly irrelevant.<p>GBI for a backup income while you&#x27;re starting a company is also something to think about: Where would the US prefer that you start a company? Here, of course. So I think that GBI encouraging people to work in the country is absolutely appropriate.<p>Finally, GBI could be provided to US citizens and permanent residents who spend more than X% of their time in the country. If that&#x27;s 51%, then you could spend nearly six months in another country getting situated before GBI would cut off, which should be more than enough time to pick up a job there. Even if it only paid you for 2-3 months of living abroad, that&#x27;s not bad for a paid vacation and/or job hunt.<p>[1] This may be obvious to most; apologies in advance. If you phase out GBI at a 1:1 rate with what you earn, as in, if you earn $10, you get $10 less GBI, then taking a job that paid less than GBI would earn you <i>nothing</i> (unless you&#x27;re being paid under the table, but let&#x27;s assume we don&#x27;t want to <i>encourage</i> people to cheat). EDIT: My math was wrong. The idea is that you set the marginal tax rates such that every dollar you earn earns you more money, but that by the time your income is at some arbitrary level, you&#x27;re paying more than GBI in taxes. Figuring out the exact rate curve is left as an exercise for the reader. ;)",1453575491

The FnMut trait (and friends) allow you to call functions with tuples as arguments. <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html</a>",1453575111

Though please take these with a slight grain of salt, as I am still learning the C11 atomics.<p>Your aring_give() ends with a release barrier and your aring_take() begins with an acquire barrier.  That makes sense to me, as a way of ensuring the sequencing of the reads/writes to aring->rb and to item.  However I don&#x27;t see why aring_give() needs to begin with an acquire and aring_take() needs to end with a release.  I think both of these could be changed to memory_order_relaxed with no change in correctness.<p>But I think we can go a step further actually.  Your atomic_fetch_add_explicit() and atomic_fetch_sub_explicit() operations operate on a shared aring->items member.  Both the reader and writer write to this variable, which requires expensive locked operations and which will degrade under contention.  I don&#x27;t think this is actually necessary.<p>Instead you could eliminate aring->items completely and simply compute it based on aring->head and aring->tail.  Only the writer writes to head and only the reader writes to tail, so you could use just atomic_load_explicit()/atomic_store_explicit() with memory_order_relaxed on these variables to read and write them.  Then calculate the number of items present by comparing them.  This could make the overall queue significantly more efficient.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to hear your thoughts on this.",1453574968

The following are kind of negative thoughts/symptoms that occurred<p>1. In most companies - it means doing 10 times work while getting paid just 5-20% higher instead of 10 times higher (here 10 is just an example multiplier).<p>2.

If you work on a really cool project that&#x27;s very technically interesting, that looks great on a resume.<p>Do you really think your interviewer (at the company you&#x27;re applying for a new job at) is going to call the old employer and ask them &quot;Hey, did this project on this guy&#x27;s resume delivery any real business value?&quot;  Of course not.  They only go by what you write on your resume, so you can spin it however you like.  If it was an interesting project but was shit-canned because of bad management or bad timing or whatever, you don&#x27;t put that part.  You talk it up in the interview when asked about it, talk about how technically interesting it was, what you learned there, etc., you don&#x27;t volunteer that it ended up being a bust.  Even if you have to spill that (because you&#x27;re specifically asked), you concentrate on the good points, how it was a great learning experience, how what you developed should be useful on future projects, etc.<p>Prospective employers are looking for skills and experience you have which will help <i>them</i> in the future.  How financially successful some project you worked on was is really irrelevant, since there&#x27;s far more to the success of a project than just the technical aspects.  Lots of companies have built technically superb products only to have them fail in the marketplace because of bad marketing, other bad management decisions, too much competition, etc.  OS/2 was completely superior to Windows 3.1 and 95 yet it failed in the marketplace; that doesn&#x27;t mean that you wouldn&#x27;t hire a guy who worked on it.",1453573902

As such; there was a &quot;generation&quot; of new engineers brought in as juniors who were laterally moved multiple times in a few years.  New engineers continued to be brought in, but due to the promotion structure of the org, a lateral transition essentially &quot;resets&quot; you, so new grads were coming in at the same level of people who had been delivering for years.<p>Now; there&#x27;s another discussion if this relates to the &quot;3x engineer&quot; thing, which I wasn&#x27;t even going to get into, but for practical purposes these engineers WEREon average performing multiple X better simply by nature of domain experience and rampup.  This resulted in different symptoms from different people; the more zen of my peers simply got saddened about feeling looked over for promotions and started considering other options.  Many left for other companies.  The less zen (myself included) got more &quot;fierce&quot; as a sister post elsewhere put it, realizing that to &quot;catch up&quot; with the career track, high visibility, high impact projects were needed, and that required pushing harder.<p>To bring some sort of conclusion out of this rambling mess;  I&#x27;m not sure your statement of &quot;vicious&quot; is the right word, but needing to stand out from that set seems to be an inevitable consequence of how many promotion structures are built, and being aware of this dynamic, engineers can be both better at their job by staying on top of their internal responses and keeping them productive (why I differentiate &quot;fierce&quot; and &quot;vicious&quot;; you can have the former without the latter I think), and Managers can better stay on top of their team dynamic and keep employees happy by realizing these emotions happen, since I find it&#x27;s an oft under-appreciated dynamic.<p>Man that ended up being FAR more of an essay than I intended.

Let&#x27;s say you want to send a small amount of data (1k) from a file to network, some header before it and some trailer behind it. With sendfile you would do three system calls, two normal writes and a sendfile. Without it you would read the file, copy the content, the header and the trailer into a single buffer and issue a single write syscall with it (of course you have the read call before). Due to the lower number of write calls this <i></i>could<i></i> be faster then sendfile, as copying a small amount of data might yield a lower overhead then multiple write requests. Of course that situation will change depending on the amount of data - so I think sendfile is one possible optimization that should be benchmarked for the particular application before using it everywhere.",1453573261

Combining democratic resources like wikibooks / open courseware and like minded individuals that want to learn the same things, plus a potential volunteer veteran or two, and for a lot of people that can produce a much better education than an overpriced book and lecture seminar with standardized testing ever could.

And we&#x27;ve seen that in the video: they&#x27;ve been able to <i>reuse</i> a rocket, ie do what everyone is chasing, and do it successfully.<p>Elon Musk wants to colonize the Solar System; he&#x27;s in for the <i>very</i> long term. BO &quot;just&quot; wants to send people high and get them back to earth for cheap. BO has a much more attainable goal, but they have made a bigger dent into that by reusing their first rocket.",1453572439

It seems like Blue Origin might be able to do some brisk trade for awhile in Russian billionnaires who can drop $100k to hop up into space and impress whatever supermodel they&#x27;re trying to woo this week.  I don&#x27;t see that ever getting to a launch-a-day.<p>I did look up the company, though, and they plan on building vehicles that can compete with the Falcon 9.  At that point the competition would start to get more interesting since that opens the doors to everything you just mentioned SpaceX could wind up doing.

A &quot;minimum viable product&quot; seems like a very simple description to me.<p>> An MVP is the smallest possible experiment to test your assumptions.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where this is coming from, unless what you get out of it is a viable product, how is it an MVP?<p>I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t experiment, or that you shouldn&#x27;t build small things and try them out, but I see no reason to keep referring to something as a minimum viable product when it meets none of the three words.<p>> This reminds me of the No true Scotsman fallacy [1].<p>Again, I&#x27;m not really sure why what I&#x27;ve said seems so odd. If it&#x27;s not the smallest viable product then how is it a minimum viable product? If it&#x27;s not a viable product, again, it&#x27;s not an MVP.<p>This is more like reading an article that says &quot;A Scotsman doesn&#x27;t need to be Scottish or even a person&quot;.<p>> This sort of critique isn&#x27;t wrong, but it&#x27;s not useful.<p>I feel it is, since I think the concept of an MVP is pretty important because at the end of it you have a <i>viable product</i>. If people are going to use the term MVP to describe proofs of concepts and mockups and a general process, then what term do you suggest should replace it for actually describing minimum viable products?",1453572333

That way even if IoT devices are abandoned or become insecure we can update our own hardware.<p>Most people would not be able to maintain their own devices, but we can easily end up with OpenWRT / DDWRT style products for each class of IoT device if they are required to be freedom respecting. Then techies will naturally instruct their peers to use supported devices, and the natural progression should get us most of the way to where we are today on routers - the liberated ones are recommended and can be supported by the community even if the OEM abandons them, and the ones that are not are a red flag to avoid. The only problem today is that since there is no compulsion to liberate routers a lot of them are sold to ignorant consumers who do not realize the mistake they are making.<p>So maybe that should be a regulation? Like with how cigarettes must inform consumers of how dangerous they are, proprietary IoT devices must have an FCC general warning their security is out of the users control.",1453572161

It's alpha software, after all, and it is released in order to allow people to learn what works and what doesn't in the real world. As usual, with open-source, if you decide to use Gnome Shell right now, or in April, you'll be running the bleeding edge. I would say that, if you want to run it as stable software, you should wait until October. Open-source is developed in the open, as it invites intelligent criticism and grows stronger with it.<p>> Furthermore, I have better things to do with my time than spend time mucking around with configuration files and theme settings<p>Unless you want to design themes, you are not supposed to do that. I rarely do. I think I haven't done that since 2003 or so, and I was really going for a full customized desktop at the time. I did it because I wanted to do it.<p>> And finally, just about every computer that is responsible for my internet access runs on top of software written by large corporations who have hired people to develop for open source bodies.<p>I would like to point out a lot of Gnome has also been developed by a lot of full-time employees of for-profit companies too. It was you who called them ""spare-time developers"". I am not sure how it will play out with Novell's demise, but I trust other companies, like Red Hat and Canonical can chip in if needed.<p>> I'm not out to bash Gnome, Linux, or open source<p>I then certainly misread your post. I didn't realize you meant ""spare-time developers"" as a compliment. My bad. I am sure open-source has a lot to gain from the criticism of a bunch of spare-time experts.<p>Meant as a compliment, of course.",1295402374
2118237,comment,2117914,2118209,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Many things that affect the economy depend upon how much ""stuff"" is already there.  A broader technology base means more innovation (= higher real GDP) in the future, because innovations build off one another.  A larger money supply (= inflation) requires a larger growth in absolute dollar terms to achieve the same effect, because the important measure is the percentage growth in the money supply, not the absolute growth.  More people (= population) have more babies, which leads to more population growth in absolute terms.  Whenever you have to multiply out changes instead of adding them, you get exponential growth instead of linear.<p>There're some notable exceptions, eg. growth in the unemployment <i>rate</i> is usually linear, because it's already computed as a percentage.  Growth in the absolute number of people unemployed is exponential.",1295402336

2118233,comment,2106766,2110761,0,0,pbiggar,,,"> Has it ever occurred to you that the way you are interpreted is because thats how you portray yourself.<p>Yes, of course. What I'm saying is that I don't deliberately portray myself like that. It's very difficult to get tone right in internet communication in general, and I don't have that solved, and nor do most people.<p>3) Sure, there was lots of guilt at the time. We lost $25K that belonged to small-time investors, as well as spending the $20K YC gave us. As well as that, we promised lots of things to lots of people, which we didn't deliver. I'm not sure it's what motivated the post though. The post certainly wasn't targeted at the people we felt we had failed.<p>4) But who would we be apologizing to, and why?<p>5) I really wasn't trying to assign blame. I was rather trying to be as forthright as possible about the causes of our failure. Assigning blame would be ridiculously difficult anyway. Who would be to blame for the breakdown in relationship between my co-founder and I? Both of us? Neither of us? Just him, just me? None of those are really satisfactory answers, and even if they were, there's nothing to be gained from them.<p>> you did give up. you were three month in to it.<p>We were about 8 months into it, but I think this doesn't affect your point. What I'm trying to say is that you're trying to assign a pejorative label (""giving up"") to something which doesn't merit one.<p>> -- now, thats just condescending and disrespectful though<p>It must be possible point out stuff like this without the assumption that I'm being condescending, which I'm not (at least not deliberately, see above).<p>> Actually, theres a bit of irony that you comment on the fallacy of ""startup work is more important than anything else""<p>I didn't love what I did anymore, I was waking up dreading the days work, so this seems to be exactly on point.",1295402223

2118228,comment,2116028,2116028,0,0,dazzla,,,"I'm in the same situation (wife, kid, mortgage, etc). I've been working on escaping from the 9 to 5 for at least 5 years trying various different things. I have always battled with the thought that if I could only work on this full time... I don't live in Silicon Valley either. I do get very disheartened but overall I keep motivated and going. I do think of all of this as my education. Each project I try builds on the last even if indirectly.<p>I now have a side project that is growing pretty consistently. It took me at least a year to realize that this could really be something. Over that time there have been periods where I have given up and not put much time into it. So far I've always come back. I can now look back and see that the months I gave up revenue stagnated. I can also clearly see what I did that increases revenue. I can also see that if I keep working at the same rate (some evenings and some weekends) and revenue increases at the same rate that it should grow into something that will replace the 9 to 5 in the near future. That is particularly exciting to me as I want a business without the stress, complications and long hours. I now look forward to not working full time on it.<p>So keep at it. Something your working on now maybe the solution. It doesn't have to be big and exciting. There's plenty of people trying the same. It's not easy for sure but certainly doable.",1295402067

2118180,comment,2118069,2118069,0,0,wdewind,,,"One simple way to figure out the correct way to create a CSS hierarchy is to avoid using physical descriptions entirely in your tags, and focus on ""content"" descriptions.  Your classes should not ever be called ""green"", ""absolute"", ""underlined"", ""float-right"" etc.  They should be called ""main-menu"", ""primary-container"" etc.  This carries over into using javascript to control the look of the page: your styles that will be swapped should be called the state of the object, not the physical change (ie: call it ""active"" not ""enlarged"").<p>This may seem trivial/obvious, but if you are working on a large site, or a front end intensive site, it's pretty important and there is a lot of this, even in otherwise clean codebases.  If you create lots of subclasses (like ""absolute"", ""red"" etc.) you tend to couple the styling of the page with the content in a really messy way (if you go to update the styles of this page you will have to do a lot of html editing as well, which defeats the purpose of external CSS).",1295400681

Write portable code in one of several languages supported by LLVM; compile with LLVM to the native NaCl format that exists for various CPU architectures, and to Portable NaCl (""PNaCl"") bytecode. LLVM can be replaced by another compiler that targets NaCl.<p>> In a world where x86 coexists with ARM, PPC-derivatives and the occasional MIPS machine (not to mention dozens of other variations) native executables are not a sensible option unless you pass that buck to the server and have it spin off a custom binary for any client that may come along.<p>All the server really needs to do is to pre-compile (or be given) a set of NaCl binaries for the presently popular archs as well as a PNaCl bytecode executable for everyone else, but yes indeed, it might also dynamically compile native binaries for minority archs it knows how to support in response to client demand. If the compile is too slow to serve the first such request with a native binary, then the server can serve the PNaCl code until the new native code is ready.<p>(As a matter of fact, it wouldn't really be necessary to replace every single HTML file with executables. But that's another story.)<p>> Even if you expect these things to run on metal you need a standard hardware configuration that exposes known I/O devices, etc.<p>It seems that NaCl provides a syscall-like interface with its ""service runtime"". Something similar could surely be created for a runtime based on hardware VMs (in other words, something like Ethernet emulation in implementation terms but with an API more suitable for a Web-browser plugin).<p>This part of the design is a weak spot of course, as it can break and fork and version and vary across implementations, but compared to the sinking sands of the browser interface it should prove much smaller and more stable. (HTML files which are genuinely documents rather than webapps are relatively robust against some API breakage but, again, it wouldn't actually be necessary to turn every HTML document with an executable blob.)<p>> Ok, ok- so we use a VM that everyone agrees on and- wait, we're back where we started, aren't we? Except, of course, we have a ton of mandatory overhead because browsers are no longer specialized to deal with the kinds of media users expect in a browsing experience.<p>Portable C or C++ compiled to NaCl should be decently fast for almost all purposes. Failing that, there's always the possibility of hand-writing raw NaCl code as an optimisation for popular architectures. (Or writing 100% native assembler if hardware virtualisation is being used instead of NaCl.) Failing that, even if a few high-performance AV formats have to be hardwired into the browser alongside WebGL (or whatever), we're still nowhere near being back where we are - in a madhouse world where a cartel of browser vendors empowers a tin-pot Napoleon to dictate, among many other things, how we will all mark up our documents, down to the minutest details.",1295399862

The selection method is one such factor.  But another factor is what individuals there are to select from in the first place.<p>Using the simple mass extinction event technique, you effectively limit the pool of individuals that can be selected from to those few that survive the extinction plus the new randomly created individuals that take the place of those that went extinct.<p>I suppose this could be considered a special rare breeding phase that combines an elitist selection method along with a 100% mutation of the remaining population.<p>Some other factors that influences diversity are the crossover and mutation operators that are used, along with the decisions concerning which parts of the program trees are allowed to change and where they get the replacements from.<p>For instance, if crossover were allowed only from or to certain parts of the tree, that could decrease (or even increase) diversity compared to the standard case of imposing no such restrictions during crossover.<p>Another possibility is performing crossover multiple times per generation on the same individual.  The more similar a given individual is to other individuals in the population, the more crossovers could be performed on that individual, hopefully increasing the diversity in the population.  Multiple mutation could similarly be employed.<p>Yet another factor that could affect diversity is simply the population size.  Clearly, a population of one individual is minimally diverse.  As the size of the population grows, so too (hopefully) does the diversity.  There has been some research in to dynamically sizing the population to increase or decrease diversity as needed.<p>Something else that has been proposed for increasing diversity is segregating highly fit individuals from very unfit individuals.  This way the highly fit individuals won't come to dominate the very unfit individuals, and thereby hopefully preserve diversity.  This could be done with an island model, and as higher fit individuals on a certain island evolve, they can be transferred out of the islands of lower fitness to other islands of higher fitness.<p>And there are probably dozens if not hundreds of other ways of trying to influence diversity, as it is a critical aspect of genetic programming.<p>One last thing I should mention (maybe I should have mentioned it first) is that a lot of this depends on exactly how you measure diversity (yet another important field of research).<p>Is it enough to call a population diverse if every individual is different from every other individual?  Well, what if they are but they differ only in ways that don't affect fitness?  Or what if they do differ in ways that affect fitness, but with only minor variations from individual to individual?  And what about structure differences?  It's possible to have two individuals with the same fitness value but different structures.  And there are many other measures as well.<p>So, depending on how you measure diversity (and when you do so, and to which members of the population), you could come up with different approaches to trying to influence it.",1295399799

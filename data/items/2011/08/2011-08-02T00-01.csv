And everybody belongs to a community - some friends who share interests (ie. developers who use git, tech people who read blogs) and there is no better initial trial audience than your own.<p>It also means that there is no expectation on a single product - more of a portfolio approach which spreads out your chances.<p>I will likely make five or so products available to the public in the next 6 months, if I am lucky only four of them will suck.",1312246703

2835207,comment,2834472,2834771,3,0,grellas,,,"<i>What hasn't changed is that the model is still fatally flawed</i><p>A business model is not flawed simply because it offers a service that entails inevitable risks of injury or harm to those who use the service (airlines have crashes; banks have embezzlers and thieves; anesthesia has an inevitable x% fatalities when used with operations; eBay has frauds and swindlers, and so on).<p>HomeAway just went public with a different but related business model as that of Airbnb. Its S-1 registration statement identified all sorts of contingencies by which the company might face liabilities from the wrongdoings of third parties in connection with its vacation rentals - everything from bogus listings by which prospective renters are swindled to robberies and bodily injury suffered by renters to physical injuries from conditions on the premises. In spite of all this, its business model has not proved to be flawed.<p>This world is not perfect and much evil can lurk in and about the nooks and crevices of human relationships. The fact that a service provider can't act as guarantor against all such risks does not mean that it can't offer a reasonable or even valuable service.<p>Airbnb probably did downplay the risks to its users up to this point (and it certainly messed up this particular incident) but it has now gone a long way to correcting that problem. If it can offer a desired service that will bring benefits to 99.99999% of its users year in and year out, and if it guarantees against a significant range of risks as it has now done, that is a lot better than most businesses do. It may or may not succeed in its venture (I for one wish them well) but that will be an issue of execution, not of a flaw in the business model tied to the inevitable risk that people sometimes do bad things.",1312246106

2835194,comment,2834472,2834771,1,0,SkyMarshal,,,">Does anyone really believe that this model has a future? Are we in that much of a bubble?<p>Sure it has a future.  There are always problems to be solved with an original business model, but they will be (or at least continuously mitigated as a proportion of the overall business).  Some examples:<p>1.  AirBnB already ties into your FB network so you can see and rent to and from friends and friends of friends.  I've found this very useful, though ABB should make it a more prominent feature of the site.<p>2.  Now they've got insurance.  If I were them I'd find some intrepid banker or actuary to figure out additional optional insurance they can sell to both hosts and renters.  $50k is a good start, but I bet many places will want more.  If a bunch of meth addicts trashed the country of Lichenstein, $50k sure wouldn't cover it.  I also bet the risk model is relatively stable and they could turn that into a secondary cash flow.<p>3.  I was actually surprised people rent their apartment/house to strangers <i>without being there</i>.  That was definitely a little nuts, no idea what EJ was thinking there.  But who knows, maybe it's another opportunity.  For example, someone with strong online rep and thousands of FB friends, or real-life security or military professional, might start up a gig where they rent themselves out to any AirBnB host in their city to stay in their apartment while the host is gone.  For, say 30% of the rental, they'll be a trusted caretaker.  AirBnBouncers.com.<p>On a side note, why are we hearing about these problems with AirBnB when Couchsurfing has been doing basically the same but free for longer?  What's the difference?  Has CS created a stronger, more connected/verified community, or do CS hosts never offer their couches without being there themselves?",1312245779

There's more to tutoring than finding someone in your zip code. I tutor organic chemistry and haven't met a single person in person. Skype tutoring is just ridiculously convenient for all parties concerned. When people flake out - because they do, a lot - at least I haven't left my office.",1312243553

As useful as firebug is, more FF users would probably benefit from a button that converts a page from English to Spanish (I'm aware Chrome already does this).  I think they should just put out the most focussed product possible, and allow their healthy dev community to add any functionality missing.<p>That said, ""packages"" might be a good idea.  The ""paranoid package"" could bundle adblock, noscript, trackmenot, and foxyproxy.  The ""developer package"" could bundle firebug and anything else that might be useful.  Offering binaries with these packages pre-installed from a visible link on the main download page might not be a bad idea.",1312243424

You want something simple, and therefore bug free.

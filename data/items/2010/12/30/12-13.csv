I'm not sure in which field Yahoo! Research works (looks like data mining), but in SE and PL, they are inexistent.<p>Best paper awards are just one metric among many. Citations, venue impact factor, number of publications are other (imperfect) metrics. It's probably fair to say that MIT and other big universities and corporate labs (IBM and Microsoft) have high scores in all of these metrics, whereas Yahoo! Research is still too young and too small to compete with even smaller but dynamic universities w.r.t. these metrics.",1293713944

I'm happier, in better shape and get so much more done at home.<p>I do understand why people work like crazy, they have huge mortgages or other loans. I cut my hours before taking huge loan (I have smallish student loan to pay), so I just need to adjust my future house/apartment to my income. It's much more easier this way, than to first take huge loan and the trying to cut hours.<p>But for my friends who don't have that much debt, I always recommend them to work less. Here in Finland we have quite heavy progression in income tax. It makes the pay cut smaller, since your tax percentage goes down. And if you have small kids, kindergartner bills goes also down, since you can pick them up earlier.<p>It's amazing how big difference two hours a day can make. Nowadays I exercise at least three times a week (I lost 10 kilos this fall, yay!), I cook better and healthier food and do some programming as a hobby.<p>Before cutting my hours, I made more or less average pay, now my salary is pretty much the same as median salary.<p>And I don't think I get any less done at work than I used to. I'm quality assurance engineer and I don't believe that anyone can really be productive for 8 hours a day in non-trivial tasks.",1293713612

(If you were desperate to keep the metaphor going- maybe they're prostitutes?  By this, I mean that when you walk up to them, you know what you want and they know what you want: 5 minutes of their time.  Sure, they may be a hot girl, but it doesn't matter because it's a business transaction.)<p>The CFO, on the other hand, is more like a girl you would potentially want a relationship with.  Very little good will come from pitching the CFO (or a movie star, etc).  An example for me is Tim Ferriss- a bunch of people were standing and watching him outside at a conference he spoke at.

One could have a game where the players are in some sort of harness, allowing full acrobatics in safety.  A lower cost version would allow for tumbling moves on a gym mat.",1293710887
2051988,comment,2051864,2051945,0,0,cstross,,,"Years ago, I had a job where I had a four day week. (Actually four days a week every week, and an extra half day one week in three.) The trouble was, the extra couple of hours per day wore me down; after four days on, I needed an extra day just to get over the cumulative fatigue before I could enjoy the weekend.<p>The best single thing you can do to reduce working fatigue is to minimize your commuting time. If you commute an hour each way to work, then over a five day week, you've racked up an extra 10 hours -- not to mention the extra expense, and the aggravation periodically inflicted by traffic jams or public transport problems -- and the worst part of it is that it's mostly dead time. (I'll make an exception for commuting to work on foot or by bicycle, as part of an exercise regime.)",1293710854

I've no doubt it seemed like a good way to encourage and reinforce contribution, but I fear it's enabling to a subtle sort of addiction.<p>Precisely what that addiction is <i>to</i> is perhaps what's hardest to answer. Is it attention? Validation? Some more abstract notion of amassment and score? I've noticed myself looking up into the corner upon return to the site, and have even consciously <i>avoided</i> that gaze pattern at times.<p>It may even come down to such fundamental questions as the existence of altruism. Just as one can ask ""are you doing this for someone else, or just because doing things for others makes you feel good?"" one can ask at ""are you contributing thoughtfully because you want to participate in the community, or because you want to see your karma go up?"" If you want to see your karma increase, is it <i>because</i> you want to participate, or the converse? Can the two be functionally separated?",1284825469

I think that this is, on the whole, one of the most valuable uses of one’s time that exists. </i><p>Very interesting insight. If you're not doing things that are transformative -- that change your habits and the way you have of looking at the world, you're wasting your time. And I don't mean that in a philosophical or political sense. It applies to everything -- coding, marketing, time management. If you spend 3 hours on HN today and leave with basically the same opinions, habits, and immediately useful pieces of knowledge that you started with? Not good for you.<p>HN has always discouraged deeply nested discussions, seeing them as just so much noise. I've always thought that was whacked. Yes, many times you are in a flame war and nothing is accomplished, but the entire point of interacting with other people is to <i>learn</i>. So you'd think that a long conversation about, I dunno, pointer arithmetic, would have a transformative effect on both the participants and the community. I think the issue here is whether you view users as intelligent folks who are trying to understand each other, or cranks and trolls who solely exist to get some emotional thrill from flaming (yes, Gresham's Law comes into play here, but everything is a trade-off)<p>As it is, what's happened is this kind of lightweight, superficial herd mentality, with folks striking out fairly deep responses and then nothing ever gets settled. Lots of generalizations and high-level talk, nothing past an initial exchange or three. I've even questioned some longtime members about various topics and was told ""I'm not posting to discuss, I'm posting to cut you off"" more or less.<p>Once I realized that HN was idle geek chitchat and not the watercooler for entrepreneurs I wanted it to be, it changed my opinion of the place. I still like it, no place like it, but it also has this terrible time-wasting underbelly that we rarely talk about enough.",1284824420

1829794,comment,1829322,1829596,0,0,pmjordan,,,"SOCKS has no inherent encryption and is insecure as hell. Although there is an encrypted mode available in some servers, it's not supported by all clients, and it doesn't defend against MITM attacks, which limits its usefulness. (ever see a SOCKS client with a tickbox ""only allow encrypted connections? didn't think so) SOCKS alone doesn't gain you any security advantage, it's SSH that does.<p>Note that if you have a tun/tap driver installed on both endpoints, ssh can even operate as a full-on VPN (-w option), thus not requiring any client software support.<p>None of the above (or OpenVPN) will work on a non-jailbroken iPhone/iPod/iPad, unfortunately. You'll need a pptp or IPSEC server for that.<p>Also beware of apps which do use SSL to communicate but don't check certificates. You'd be surprised how many get this wrong. This leaves the connection wide open to MITM attacks.<p>EDIT: objective arguments > downvoting",1288015145

When you compare it to the difficulty of say elementary calculus, you will notice that the concepts are simple.<p>Any person who studied computer science and do not know how a pointer works (or how to represent an access an array with a pointer) is grossly incompetent. C does not hide the basic programming concepts behind a nice IDE which you double click to type your portion of code.<p>I recently had another problem (with one person who was busy with a Masters degree at a fairly prestigious technology university). The project involved having video updates. I wrote a demonstration that performed the computation in a “while(1)” loop (i.e. fetch frame, do processing, display frame). The person was involved in writing a simple GUI program.<p>I tried to explain to him that he cannot use a “while (1)” loop in the event handler of the button that should start the event. Even drew nice graphs on a board explaining all about the thread of execution and how event handling usually works (e.g. a loop that handles events and call functions).<p>After 30 minutes of explanation the person came up with a very bright idea. He said that “Maybe we should set a sleep(1000) command in the loop to give the program time to react”. WTF?",1288015044

Heck, I've never seen a biker hit a car, even though I see a hundred bikers or so each day. Nobody wears helmets in the Netherlands. If you see somebody with a helmet you can be sure that it's a foreigner, somebody under the age of four, or somebody on a racing bike.<p>Now suppose you do get hit and lets even suppose that you get hit on the head. What's the probability that you get hit on the helmet? Small: only the top of your head is protected. For racing bikers it can help. Due to the way you sit on those bikes it's much more likely you'll land on the top of your head.<p>It makes more sense to wear gloves than to wear a helmet. Nine out of ten times your hands will get injured. And in my experience you do think about how you fall in the split second you're in the air.

They're baiting you into either settling or making a damaging admission. For example, ""I know I was meant to pay you but..."". You've just stipulated that you owe the sender money.

Either direct them to your lawyer or forward the correspondence to your lawyer and have them draft a response, if it's reached that point.<p>I guess what I'm getting at is this: avoid saying anything unnecessary. Don't volunteer any information you don't have to. Don't accept the premise of the question (eg when someone says ""Are you going to pay me or stiff me?"" and you answer ""Stiff you"" it can be argued you've accepted the premise of the question by admitting that you do owe them money).<p>Also, many make the mistake of assuming that verbal contracts are worth the paper they're printed on. HUGE mistake. If you tell someone ""I'll pay you $100 a day to do my gardening"" hoping that if it comes to court it's your word against his, consider: if that person shows up and does your gardening and goes home and then does it the day after, any court will come to the conclusion that some agreement was in place as it isn't reasonable for someone to simply start doing that, particularly when you didn't correct them of any alleged misunderstanding.<p>You'll get similar advice when giving depositions and evidence in court: answer the question but only the question asked.

I've had multiple rants directed my way by web developers telling me that I was making a big mistake by using a framework - for all the sorts of reasons listed in this rant.<p>So apparently I'm ruining the universe by employing tools I don't fully understand.  I must admit this particular complaint I find a bit perplexing. I'll drop down a level of abstraction if I find the universe demands it of me.  Otherwise - I really don't care about what's going on in bowels beneath me.  Maybe Gandalf is getting it on with a Balrog for all I know... but for my needs, it just doesn't matter.<p>I mean - I'll learn assembler if I come up against a use case that demands it of me.  But that's just not likely to happen for the silly little things I'm working on.<p>I also happen to believe that it's a waste of time to teach kids the algorithm that you work through on paper for long division.  Give the tykes a calculator and let society progress at the faster pace that technology allows.  I mean - claiming that you need to use an abacas to do basic sums because that's how we old folk did it, is just ridiculous.  All algorithms are just effective procedures which depend on a certain level of technological sophistication to be employed.  The introduction of arabic numerals meant that we didn't have to use abacuses any more.  Hooray!<p>Besides that - I actually know people whose applications I have aped for learning purposes - and I notice that I wrote them in about the tenth of the time, with less than a tenth of the experience, and they also seem to the run at ten times the speed with similar functionality.  I hear yarns about how they were doing dumb things like not setting primary keys, or making loads of unnecessary calls on the database etc... and I think about how Django really helps me to steer clear of many of the basic mistakes.  I learn about these as I go because I continue to read the awesome documentation as well as digging into the guts of how Django works.  Through this I get a lesson on how at least one group of professionals think web development should be done.<p>I personally feel much better placed going forward than all the folks who've had to roll their own over the past 10 years.  When I feel more comfortable with Django, probably the next thing I'll do is learn another framework - so as to get another perspective from the professionals.<p>I think it's a great way to learn - personally...  and folks who think otherwise I'm going to keep ignoring.",1288012275

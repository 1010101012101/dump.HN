4142628,comment,4142283,4142542,2,0,Retric,,,"This raises a great point, is it OK to clone a bad game and make it fun?  I would argue that the mechanics that make a game fun are more important than the idea so copying the 'fun' parts is probably worse than just copying the idea.  It's also more obvious that your making a significant change.<p>Edit: The article suggests that angry birds differs because of the mechanics of a slingshot being more inviting. However an arbitrary score to advance vs. # of projectiles and targets killed makes is IMO a more important advance even if it seems trivial it makes a vary different game.",1340294377

4142621,comment,4137409,4138352,1,0,alinajaf,,,">  Depth is hard to measure, but generally I find that clients will ask a question about a specific programming topic and start off basic. When the candidate gets that right, they go a little deeper with the second question and the candidate fails.<p>My experience bears this out. In one of the best interviews I had the interviewer essentially picked items off my CV and asked me more and more about them until I was forced to say ""I don't know"". This was supposedly deliberate (i.e. they wanted to see a) how much knowledge I actually had and b) what I would do at the limits of it). I came away from that interview with no idea of how well I did, but I got the job!<p>> Not being willing to work at all with PHP, Java or MS could be perceived as entitled if everyone else has to dive in on those from time to time.<p>In a tougher market I might be singing a different tune, but at the moment there's just so much work out there that I think the average developer can afford to be a little picky, or entitled as it were.

4142618,comment,4140235,4140783,1,0,rst,,,"The usual arguments for someone to settle a legal case are avoiding the costs of litigation, and a potentially ruinous award.<p>From Google's perspective, though, these may not be operating the way they usually do.  Google, and particularly Android, are getting patent suits from all quarters, and have to think about the cost of <i>all</i> that litigation, not just this case.  So, they might view the best outcome in this case as the one which is most likely to deter the <i>next</i> guy.  Quietly settling for a low nine-figure sum is unlikely to achieve that; quiet settlements for that amount risk them having patent trolls lined up out the door from Mountain View to Gilroy.  And after Oracle came in initially demanding billion-dollar damages up front plus a share of ongoing Android revenues, even that might not be enough for Oracle to ""save face"".  (Edit:  yes, I'm aware this is no longer strictly a patent case, but that's how it started, patents were an issue at trial, and once it goes to court, both parties are always throwing whatever they have at the wall.)<p>Also, at this point, the prospects of a large award against Google are (one hopes!) minimal --- they could only come after a reversal on appeal.  And, in addition to Alsup's trial court ruling, they can count on a flood of amicus briefs pointing out (correctly, IMHO) how reversal would be calamitous for the industry.  So, that's a gamble Google might want to take.  And Oracle has no choice.<p>So, a settlement might be in the interest of the larger community, but I'm not sure either party would likely see it in their own private interest.",1340294226

I put pretty conservative responses and probably had a footprint smaller than the average middle-class American and still got over 20 slaves. Which doesn't really extrapolate well to the country as a whole.<p>What does it mean that 20 slaves work for you? Does it mean there are 20 slaves who at some point or another use products that you consume, or does it mean that there are an equivalent of 20 slaves working full-time for you (in terms of man-hours or something)? The former metric is rather meaningless since it's unclear what proportion of the labor of those 20 slaves benefits you. Is 1/1000th of their labor output? 50%? This makes a huge difference. The latter metric is meaningful, in that it would mean that you ""employ"" around 20 slaves. However the mathematics don't really work out in that case, since 20 slaves per person for hundreds of millions of Americans obviously doesn't make sense.<p>The way it's written as you point out seems to indicate that they're using the former metric, that is, the number of slaves involved in stuff you use, regardless of what proportion of their labor goes toward your lifestyle.",1340294143

This app will probably run only on the most recent iOS versions, so this also cuts a part of ""old"" iOS users.
Instead a website, maybe optimized for mobile(there are tons of way to do this, nowadays it's not hard) would have been avaible to everyone.

While I totally get that 'everything is a remix', I still can't help but feel that kick in the gut every time this happens. I am always bothered by how much I care. It took me a while to reconcile this emotional-jerk. Here's how I see it now:<p>John Cleese has a wonderful talk about how each project consists for 'open' and 'close' modes [1]. In one sentence - open mode is playing around with ideas and stumbling upon a gem in the rough, while closed mode is the execution of polishing that gem to perfection.<p>Seen through this framework, I would claim that 'cloning' is the act of jumping in on someone else's open-mode work, and forking a new close-mode.<p>Why do we care when someone does this? I think that as the open-mode is a highly creative process, it is hard to not get emotionally attached to the rough-gems it produces. Some will describe it as nothing shy of birthing an idea. In that sense, the kick-in-the-gut that I feel is probably the sense of loss associated with someone 'snatching my new-born'.<p>I'm not suggesting that cloning is good or bad, but just trying to provide a reasonable explanation to why we feel pain when someone clones our work - even though we know it's OK.<p>[EDIT: there are situations where 'cloning' is in essence thievery.

4142538,comment,4141675,4141675,4,0,hsmyers,,,"When I came back to college after the war, I resumed my studies as an art major. For those of us involved, the 'zone' was pretty much a natural state. We would drop in and out for conversations and such. But mostly as soon as you pick up a chisel or piece of boxwood to smooth clay or whatever it might be to initiate work, the rest of the world pretty much goes away. To the degree that I remember such things, this has always been the way it works for me. I pretty much see it as intimately tied to any creative task. When after 8 years of enjoying myself I woke up and realized that you really can't make a living as an art major I walked across the campus to what would one day become the computer department (then a branch of the business school) sat down and proceeded to learn how to program. I was very surprised to discover that there was no difference between the 'zone' with painting and the 'zone' with programming. This lead me to the notion that it must be tied to the idea of creativity. I've seen virtually nothing since that would lead me to believe otherwise. Since I started zoning out in grade school, I can't really give advice on how you might arrive there, but if what you are doing is 'creative' then you most likely will find that moment when you lose yourself in the activity---at that point, welcome to the zone! As far as literature goes, most of what I've read that seems to explain or resonate comes from the world of Zen. In particular the idea of 'Mushin'.

It's the kind of book that's almost impossible to excerpt, but a few of my favorite passages might illuminate a few of the topics it covers:<p>""Though the evidence suggests that most people are caught up on this frustration treadmill of rising expectations, many individuals have found ways to escape it. These are people who, regardless of their material conditions, have been able to improve the quality of their lives, who are satisfied, and who have a way of making those around them also a bit more happy.<p>Such individuals lead vigorous lives, are open to a variety of experiences, keep on learning until the day they die, and have strong ties and commitments to other people and to the environment in which they live. They enjoy whatever they do, even if tedious or  difficult; they are hardly ever bored, and they can take in stride anything that comes their way. Perhaps their greatest strength is that they are in control of their lives"" {Csikszentmihalyi ""Flow""@10}.<p>This also sounds like descriptions of resilience. Maybe there's a connection between flow and being resilient, like one enables the other. Or do they go together?<p>""What I 'discovered' [25 years before the writing of this book] was that happiness is not something that happens. It is not the result of good fortune or random chance. It is not something that money can buy or power command. It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them. Happiness, in fact, is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated, and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives, which is as close as any of us can come to happiness"" {Csikszentmihalyi ""Flow""@2}.<p>""One of the most frequently mentioned dimensions of the flow experience is that, while it lasts, one is able to forget all the unpleasant aspects of life. This feature of flow is an important by-product of the fact that enjoyable activities require a complete focusing of attention on the task at handthus leaving no room in the mind for irrelevant information.<p>In normal everyday existence, we are the prey of thoughts and worries intruding unwanted in consciousness. Because most jobs, and home life in general, lack the pressing demands of flow experiences, concentration is rarely so intense that preoccupations and anxieties can be automatically ruled out. Consequently the ordinary state of mind involves unexpected and frequent episodes of entropy interfering with the smooth run of psychic energy. This is one reason why flow improves the quality of experience: the clearly structured demands of the activity impose order, and exclude the interference of disorder in consciousness"" {Csikszentmihalyi ""Flow""@58}.<p>This is what I feel when I write.",1340293333

It doesn't have to be a gradual change over 20 years.<p>The focus of the project sounds quite meaningful, and it is well said in the first couple lines:  ""We're going to share stories about smart women doing important things."" That is perfect; I want to read those stories!<p>The copy gets off track a bit after that, like others here are already saying.  ""We're simply going to hound some clever women in tech..."" does not sound good.  Part of the problem is women in tech getting hounded.  I know the intention here is good, but there is language that doesn't bring to mind the problems.  This project is strong enough that you can just say, ""We're going to invite clever women in tech...""  People will understand the project, and want to be part of it.<p>Others are talking about the ""We're really not complaining"" slogan, but I have no idea what ""We're not endorsing the obvious"" means.

4142494,comment,4141240,4141240,1,0,law,,,"I appreciate their efforts, but I disagree with a couple of their points. First, their use of the term 'troll' automatically imbues the reader with a sense of the type of person from whom this effort attempts to protect innovators: people whose single business purpose is the collection and enforcement of patents. That's simply a small, yet quite vocal, subset of the majority of people who benefit from patent law, and who should be entitled to protect their inventions.<p>With that in mind, I completely agree with limiting the term of software patents. In fact, I agree with limiting the terms of patents, generally; not inventions are the same, and technological innovation across various sectors does not progress at the same rate. Pharmaceutical patents, for example, typically aren't enforced until FDA approval occurs (which is sometimes up to 15 years later, giving them only 5 years to recoup the often immense investment in the research leading to the drug!).<p>The second point is awful: why should someone with a bona fide claim in patent infringement have to pay when the court rules against their favor in something that's an arguable question of law? Claim construction is done by the court; that is, the judge is the one who decides what claims in a patent mean. If the judge's decision goes against what you reasonably believed to be a correct construction of the claims and the defendant then prevails on a motion to dismiss, but you appeal, and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reverses, but then the defendant appeals and it goes to the Supreme Court, which agrees with the original judge and by dint of their judgment creates new law? Shouldn't both parties have to pay their respective attorneys' fees here? Of course. Oh, you mean cases of vexatious or malicious litigation, which are effectively extortion? Call the bar association of the lawyers involved, and file an ethics complaint. Patent trolls can be kept in line with ethics complaints.<p>I disagree with 3, because it violates due process unless there are significant changes to the Patent Act. Keep in mind: there's a major difference between sufficiency of disclosure and <i>actually</i> practicing an invention. Patent law has never required an inventor to actually produce or manufacture their invention, because it understands that sometimes, this is impossible. In software cases, what happens if you've imagined a beautifully complex system that's novel and non-obvious, but the software, skills, time, etc. required to bring it to fruition preclude you from doing so for whatever reason? What if you instead wish to license the invention to someone who can produce or manufacture the software? This provision would perpetuate corporate oligopolies by entitling those with the resources to reap the benefits of patent protection. We cannot allow this to happen.<p>That brings me to independent inventions: I'm on the fence about this. Copyright law has something similar to this, but patent law doesn't, and I'm not really sure why. My only idea is that during the inventive process, you will always be looking to prior art, and a reasonably prudent person would likely discover the patented subject matter during this process. Of course, this doesn't address the concern with an 'ignorant inventor' independently inventing something patented. Here's the issue: issued patents are published, and the public is 'on notice' that this invention is no longer in the public domain. Of course, there are more than 7 million patents, of which maybe 2 million or so are active. While possible, it's just not the best use of someone's time to ensure that they're not infringing on someone else's invention. But it's also unfair to the inventor who took the steps to patent their invention if this 'independent inventor' is allowed to reap the benefits of something taken out of the public domain with notice given. I guess the problem we have is that notice isn't 'effective', and that falls onto the patent office: they need a better categorization system. This is a problem with the executive branch, rather than the legislative or judicial.<p>Finally, I just want to talk about the sixth point, that someone shouldn't be allowed to collect 'millions' for a 'tiny infringement.' To me, this discredited the entire post, because it unnecessarily muddies the water with regard to liability. Patent infringement does not lead to treble damages (which I guess they fear), but willful patent infringement does. When an inventor sends you a cease and desist letter and you continue to practice the invention knowing that you're infringing, then you're liable for enhanced damages. But, you have to continue practicing the invention in willful disregard to the patent--it's a jury question.<p>In short, the patent system IS in need of reform to take into account the mutability of technological advancement. However, let's not jump to conclusions and pollute the Patent Act with exceptions to a technology that appears on its face to be an exception; we need to find and eradicate the root cause of the perceived injustices.",1340292938

If you say ""computer"", I strongly disagree, because a computer is a very general description for a variety of different machines.<p>Secondly, when we're talking about learning, using a command line will probably (definitely?) stimulate reasoning and abstract thinking, whereas you can emulate the effect of a touch screen with a door bell.<p>Addendum: Of course, you can emulate a keyboard with an iPad, but then what's the point?

4142307,comment,4141527,4141527,33,0,hkarthik,,,"A significant issue is that nobody trains employees while compensating them fairly based on their aptitude. So the only option is for employees to bounce around to get new skills and better wages. Employers hate this and constantly complain about ""employee loyalty"", not recognizing that job hopping is the only real defense that an employee has to be fairly compensated.<p>Here is a fictional account that illustrates the point:<p>John Doe currently writes C++ and finds Company A with great benefits and excellent compensation, but they only hire experienced Python programmers. But across the street, Company B will hire C++ programmers and train them on Python. Company B doesn't pay nearly as well, and the benefits are also pretty poor in comparison to Company A.<p>Company B offers John a position, but at a below market salary for Python programmers. John would be taking a pay cut from what he makes as a C++ programmer, but he takes the job anyway.<p>Being a highly capable individual, after 1 year John is one of the top Python programmers in Company B. John meets some engineers from Company A at a local meetup, and they recruit him to come interview with Company A. John passes the interviews with flying colors and is offered 30% more salary at Company A than he currently makes at Company B. This is now more than John ever made as a C++ programmer so he gladly takes the job, after only staying at Company B for a year.<p>Similar events occur with many more employees from Company B as they all start getting poached by Company A. Company B creates a non-compete agreement with Company A to keep its programmers from leaving.<p>Company A now complains to Congress that it can't find enough workers and needs to hire more foreign workers to fill the gap. It gets more foreign workers, which it can then hire at lower salaries without having to poach talent from Company B. Over time, the executives at Company A realize the cost savings and start cutting salaries, raises, and benefits.<p>Engineers at both Company A and B now realize their wages are stagnating and they all start leaving for other opportunities. Executives at Company A and B start lobbying Congress more and complaining to the press about a talent shortage and their inability to find workers.",1340290856

582440,comment,582350,582350,0,0,mdasen,,,"I don't think that the lack of women programmers has much to do with male programmers or computer science programs.  Male programmers and computer science programs always seem to love women who express an interest in it.  Let's face it, none of us want this to be a male-only profession.<p>However, society does socialize people into gender roles.  Women are taught not to go for math (which computer science, at least at an academic level, depends on) and the sciences just as men are taught to forgo sociology.  Remember, there are departments that are mostly women at colleges and it's equally telling to ask why there aren't men in those departments - not as a matter of discrimination, but a matter of socialization.  Anyway, women tend to be pushed away from certain paths just as men are pushed away from certain paths (while I find nursing to be an admirable profession, what percentage of nurses do you think are male?  And I think it's decently clear that from a young age, many of us have the image of doctors being male and nurses being female).<p>It's a big problem in our society, but I don't think that programers and computer science departments are to blame.  We train children from very young ages to go into certain roles.  Once you're along a path (any path at any point in life) there is a high cost of switching.  If you've been pushed away from math and science through high-school, the chance that you can switch that in college is very low.  You have to make up a lot of work that the other students already did - and you're throwing away the work you've done on an alternate path.  Having not had biology and chemistry in high-school, medicine was simply out of the question for me in college unless I intended to work much, much harder than my fellow students - and the premeds were an over-achieving bunch.<p>And, really, this is more of a problem if you're going toward the science than if you're going toward the social sciences or humanities.  Why?  At my school, computer science was an 18 course major; nuroscience 21 courses; biochem was up there too.  What did you need for history?  8 courses.  Sociology? 10.  Anthropology? 9.  And you could usually take those courses at the same time while the sciences tend to build on each other in a linear fashion to a greater extent.<p>It's harsh.  Even if you want to change into a science, sometimes the barrier is too high.  We need to do a better job teaching children that it's unacceptable for both genders to forgo science and math.  Otherwise, you end up (like me) in a freshmen bio class realizing that you have to learn everything that everyone else knew from high-school without falling behind on this course.  And I'd say that the majority would take the path of least resistance and go for something they weren't missing knowledge in.",1240880271

(not an Apple fan, but they usually get this stuff right; this page is not perfect, but not bad).<p>A few things:<p>* Notice the background color is darker than the content; this is to emphasize the actual content of the page. I would make the background color a bit darker.<p>* You probably don't have as many ""categories"" so I would put everything in one page.<p>* Notice the attraction points. Close your eyes for 5 second then open then. What do you notice the first second? This is where people will look first. You need to have the important stuff there or near it. The attraction points are usually images.<p>* Make a video or what your application does. People expect to be entertained, not to read. Once you capture their attention you can present more text / information. If you entertain somebody, either with a good video or nice eye candy, they will feel indebted to look more into your product. So the stages / levels should be 1: wow them, 2: convince them, 3: educate them<p>* Pay attention to details in your website and also your product. If your presentation page is good, people will at least give your application a fair shot. Their first impression is your site not the first time they use your application; that's way later.<p>For more tips:

It's entirely possible that it's not a case of women being shut out, but rather they haven't been sold on the profession to begin with. In short: an image problem.<p>I know this doesn't apply to the situation we have here with this ruby presentation full of porn, but as long as we are generalizing this specific instance into the ""why aren't there more women in CS?"" question, I thought I'd throw it out there.<p>It's not like programming is the only profession with this problem. As a male, I haven't been particularly sold on being a nurse either, despite the fact that (in my area) it pays roughly the same and the few male nurses I know love the flexibility to move around the country almost at will.

582413,comment,582350,582350,0,0,mcslee,,,"Interesting, but I think this argument is flawed. The author notes that different professions tend to have different distributions of male personality types. Programmers tend towards meek and introverted, lawyers and businessmen more alpha, yet women don't shy away from those fields.<p>This seems to assume that women must magically all have the same personality type and/or no personality selection bias in their career choices. Since women are comfortable going head-to-head with alpha-male lawyers, they therefore should be totally comfortable with geeky programmers. I don't buy it -- all women are not the same, just like all men are not the same.<p>It seems to me that women who become lawyers or businesspeople likely have A-type personalities themselves. Accordingly, they are probably more likely to view competition or confrontation with males in the workplace as a motivating challenge. Women who become programmers are probably, just like male programmers, a bit more introverted and geeky. Accordingly, confrontation/competition with males in the workplace is probably less likely to be motivating, and more likely to be intimidating -- especially when you consider that many ""meek"" male programmer types tend to drastically overcompensate for insecurity in physical situations with hyper-competitive and vitriolic behavior in virtual environments (I wonder what the gender and programmer/non-programmer ratios are like on 4chan).<p>In other words, just because male programmers don't rank as alpha-males relative to the general male population doesn't mean they don't behave like alpha-males in their own environment, especially relative to the female personality types interested in becoming programmers.<p>My 2 cents.",1240879584

If the application critical it is likely that the feature will be built into the iPhone at a later date or a free version will come out.

Programming and IT have historically attracted a large number of social rejects, who, despite scoring high on self-evaluated liberalness, have no idea how to talk to women.  Whether the individual problem is general awkwardness, sexist beliefs, bitterness towards women, or inability to engage with women or fawning all over them, if half the guys in an IT department have one of these problems then it's going to be a very unwelcoming place to be for a woman.<p>I remember in my undergrad that the ratio of men to women in CS classes created a problem in and of itself as any remotely attractive woman had to fight off all kinds of unwanted attention from a steady stream of unattractive guys.  To me it's no surprise that by senior year they had dwindled to a handful.",1240878840

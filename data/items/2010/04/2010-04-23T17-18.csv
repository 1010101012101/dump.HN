That's not a deal-breaker, but I'm an enormous fan of where Python syntax has gone since then, so it pains me especially. With a self-hosting syntax interpreter, even a minimally maintained project like Jython could keep up with most changes.<p>Another less-practical issue is that of syntax evolution: like Apple, Python has taken the route of benevolent-overlord to make design decisions. Thanks to the good taste of Steve and GvR, I think that's worked out really well. But neither is perfect, and especially in the case of programming language design, I'd wager the end product could benefit from having a market system of minor syntax features competing in user-space, not just in Guido's head. Just as ""from __future__ import print_function"" changes the syntax of a file, so could ""from __macros__ import anaphoric_if"".<p>1.

1288898,comment,1288499,1288499,0,0,lmkg,,,"I will concede one point to the article, which is that if you wait until high school to start learning a foreign language, you won't get much out of it. According to modern theories of cognitive development, you switch from language ""acquisition"" to language ""learning"" sometime around puberty (usually cited as age 13). The two models of gaining knowledge and skills are qualitatively different both in how they operate, and in the benefits they give.<p>I don't have a link, but I've heard that there's solid research saying that kids who grow up bilingual have a better basis for abstract concepts. This makes sense to me: having two symbols for everything makes you more aware of the difference between the symbol and the thing it stands for, and having two ways of expressing a concept makes you more open to hother ways of expressing (and perceiving) it.<p>The main point is, if you start taking your first foreign language in high school, you're only acquiring the single skill of speaking that one language, and I agree that skill may not be utile for you. If you start learning foreign languages earlier (even 2 years earlier!), it has an impact much larger than gaining a single skill. Language is fundamental to human thought, and being able to speak more than one language makes it easier to think in different ways.<p>I would say that teaching kids a foreign language early on is as important as math skills early on, and programming concepts should probably be given the same treatment. Not that I expect every kid to grow up into a programmer, but that style of thinking is useful.",1272045349

A cyclist is <i>extremely</i> unlikely to kill or injure a pedestrian or another cyclist--and probably incapable of injuring a driver--while drivers kill tens of thousands of other drivers and thousands of pedestrians every year.  Cars are incredibly dangerous.<p>If someone wants to ride a bicycle drunk, they are realistically only endangering themselves.  If people are going to get drunk anyway--and they will--allowing them an additional relatively safe, legal method to get home would make the streets much safer for everyone.<p>In Portland, people bike drunk all the time.  There are extremely few arrests.  Cops drove by my obviously drunk friend the other night and chose to do nothing.

Simply firewall your Facebook access away from your other online access.  It's annoying that browsers let so much information bleed between connections and provide either poor controls of same or poor promotion of such controls where they exist.<p>Currently, I have my Facebook access running through one browser that is doing nothing else.  I use other browsers for other access.  I would disallow Flash ""super cookies"" except that that borks a few other sites I access, so I wipe them at each shut down.  (I'm also not entirely trustful of Adobe's online control panel and ""black box"" implementation.)  I'm now considering controlling them yet more aggressively, as I see them as a means of cross-browser communication during the course of access that takes place between wipes.<p>All that aside, I too am becoming quite uneasy with Facebook.

I can rattle off a few reasons: the goal isn't to teach only subjects that people enjoy, but to help create productive and responsible citizens of not only our country, but of the entire world. Particularly in this age of globalization, it's increasingly important for people to have knowledge of languages other than English.<p>Further, the earlier one starts with language education, the better one is at learning _all_ languages later in life. It also makes traveling vastly easier.<p>It's also usually the case that by learning the language of a people, you begin to have a much better understanding of their culture.

The way I see it, there are two types of coupons: the price discrimination variety and the early-adopter-advantage variety. The former category includes things like grocery flyers and has a certain stigma associated with it -- which is why it works (if everyone clipped grocery coupons, the store would be making less money, not more). The latter category is where Groupon fits in, and I don't think it has the same stigma as the former, nor do I think the recession will affect it as much.<p>Flashing your iPhone to save 60% on surfing lessons sends different social-status signals than clipping newspaper coupons to save 25 cents on canned soup.",1272042283

Human natural language, English especially, is not like simultaneous equations where terms can be freely reduced with no loss of accuracy.  The range of ""big words"" and ""small words"" signify similar but not identical concepts... but of course, if you follow the thoughts of my other responder, the work of Saussure, Derrida et al on signifiers and signified didn't involve any abstract thinking, just reading and regurgitation.<p>I do admit that my initial post was perhaps rather bullishly worded, and in that sense, the downvotes perhaps deserved.

I'd say this is a textbook example of deceptive wall-of-text style concern trolling, and at the very least is not a very honest discussion of the topic or the article. You say, ""But I worry about articles like this that have popped up in the aftermath, especially when they are so full of inaccuracies as this."" Yet you introduce so many inaccuracies yourself.<p>Your response seems to misconstrue many things. Stamos specifically states he is correcting erroneous information being spread, but you try to disagree with these facts. You also suggest they are not relevant, even if they are in fact correcting a lot of bad information that is floating around.<p>You say it is irrelevant that ""MIT runs an open network,"" but if exaggerated charges are being made, and he is being accused of maliciously hacking into this network, then it is relevant.<p>""MIT could have locked the network down, but didn't."" you quote, though I couldn't find this quote,  as a ""poor excuse"".  Poor excuse to what? How can you even compare locking your car doors to a university library network in any way? This case seems rather far from grand theft auto, except maybe the similarly named game, because it's as equally over the top as the charges.<p>Then you ""quote"" another part: ""MIT doesn't specifically tell its users not to do dickwad things to its network."" I put quote in quotes because I failed to find the word dickwad. Did I miss this part?\nYou take a lot of liberties rephrasing and restating what the author wrote. It seems almost certain we didn't read the same article, or you are concern trolling.<p>To suggest he's engaging in victim-blaming here is ridiculous. The ""victims"" didn't even pursue charges, even though the government made it easy for them to do so. It is challenging to even try to claim there are ""victims"" here at all.<p>Then you employ more false quotations: ""But he wasn't trespassing!"". And in the next sentence, ""the Federal government isn't charging him with such"". Uh, OK?<p>I also failed to find the quoted parts. But to point out that trespassing charges were dropped seems relevant when there are people out there claiming trespassing---correcting erroneous information. Your car door suggestion, or definitely other people talking about ""walking through an unlocked door"", suggest trespassing.<p>You go on to say: I wonder also why Aaron was so worried about being termed a 'felon'.\nWhich seems to trivialize the situation, and suggests there are no consequences. Maybe you weren't aware that felons commonly have their voting rights denied? And that's just the start.<p>This is just outright stupid on your part. Are you even being serious?: Roman Polanski is still making movies; Aaron would have been just fine. But that was his choice to make. :(\nYou do realize Roman Polanski fled the USA at the prospect of serving MORE jail time than originally agreed to, and has not returned, and charges have not been dropped, and more information is available on his Wikipedia page. The USA is still pursuing him even though he has settled with the victim.",1358146388

But to me it sounds like the issue for you is probably less about porn specifically and more just being inside, on the computer, and in your own head too much. Try taking a few days in a row to get up early and be outside, active, and away from the computer <i>all</i> day, ideally with other people you enjoy being around if possible.<p>Hiking, camping trips, road trips with friends, even volunteering are all things that can help you to clear out compulsive and destructive thought cycles and get a better outlook on things. The world is a really beautiful, rich, and incredible place--porn is quite empty and boring by comparison. Even in the realms of sexuality and eroticism, you can find a lot more potent and interesting forms of arousal out there if you open up to other people and new experiences. I'd guess if you could start to do that, the pull porn has on you would naturally subside.",1358146174

That getting rid of Ortiz won't fix anything (""it's not the relatively simple matter of stopping overzealous prosecution in one agency"".)<p>Those things may all be true, but what you don't seem to understand is that calls for firing Ortiz aren't about fixing the system.  That's a bigger fight, a job that will take a long time.  They're about punishment.  With your narrow legalistic thinking, you seem to be incapable of recognizing that people have means of discovering the truth other than legal procedures.  It's almost certain that Ortiz followed the letter of the law and the rules of criminal procedure, but it doesn't matter.  She threatened a man, a man many here consider a hero, with 35 years in federal prison for allegedly committing a crime that, at most, prevented MIT from accessing JSTOR for a few days.  People have decided, using means not codified in statute, that she has done a terrible thing and must be punished.  It doesn't matter that the system is broken.<p>You lawyers keep saying that punishing Ortiz will have no consequence, because someone else will take her place. Well, people don't care.  This is not about deterrence.  That's such a laughably small part of it.  Here are some other reasons for punishment, courtesy of Nietzsche<p>> punishment as a way of rendering someone harmless, as a prevention from further harm<p>People would certainly like to see Ortiz rendered harmless.<p>> punishment as isolation of some upset to an even balance in order to avert a wider outbreak of the disturbance<p>Who knows what some of the more unbalanced Anons will do<p>> punishment as festival, that is, as the violation and humiliation of some enemy one has finally thrown down<p>Yep<p>So you see it's not just about deterrence.  The sad part, though, is that the one thing punishment will never achieve is to make Ortiz have a guilty conscience.

5053576,comment,5053483,5053483,29,0,xxpor,,,">Not surprisingly for government IT projects, PACER looks like most web sites did around 1994. It's actually not one web site at all, but more like one hundred, spread across different court districts and circuits in the country. The district-level courts each have their own custom version because judges demand custom features, and no one can refuse their demands. The appellate-level courts have an entirely different and separate infrastructure, written in a different language. (Technically-inclined readers, it's a Java applet. But really twelve different Java applets, depending on the circuit. No joke.) The Supreme Court, which can do whatever it wants, opts out of PACER entirely. Each level of PACER has separate login requirements, not to mention that PACER is separate from CM/ECF, an unbelievably badly-named system that actually lets you file documents, but under a separate login. What this means is that it is essentially impossible to follow a case from court to court, and if you even try, it is very, very expensive.<p>What. The. Fuck.",1358145965

While charging for access was previously required, Section 205(e) of the E-Government Act changed a provision of the Judicial Appropriation Act of 2002 (28 U.S.C. 1913 note) so that courts may, only to the extent necessary (instead of shall) charge fees for access to information available through automatic data processing equipment. The Committee report stated: [t]he Committee intends to encourage the Judicial Conference to move from a fee structure in which electronic docketing systems are  supported primarily by user fees to a fee structure in which this information is freely available to the greatest extent possible Pursuant to existing law, users of PACER are charged fees that are higher than the marginal cost of disseminating the information.<p>Since the passage of the E-Government Act, the vision of having information freely available to the greatest extent possible is far from being met, despite the technological innovations that should have led to reduced costs in the past eight years. In fact, cost for these documents has gone up, from $.07 to $.08-per-page. The Judiciary has attempted to mitigate the shortcomings of the current fee approach in a variety of ways, including limiting charges to $2.40-per-document and the recent announcement that any charges less than $10-per-quarter will be waived.

Aaron's act was undoubtedly political activism; it had tragic consequences.<p>Our wishes<p>We call for this tragedy to be a basis for reform of computer crime laws, and the overzealous prosecutors who use them.\nWe call for this tragedy to be a basis for reform of copyright and intellectual property law, returning it to the proper principles of common good to the many, rather than private gain to the few.\nWe call for this tragedy to be a basis for greater recognition of the oppression and injustices heaped daily by certain persons and institutions of authority upon anyone who dares to stand up and be counted for their beliefs, and for greater solidarity and mutual aid in response.\nWe call for this tragedy to be a basis for a renewed and unwavering commitment to a free and unfettered internet, spared from censorship with equality of access and franchise for all.<p>For in the end, we will not be judged according to what we give, but according to what we keep to ourselves.<p>Aaron, we will sorely miss your friendship, and your help in building a better world. May you read in peace.<p>----<p>Who was Aaron Swartz? A hero in the SOPA/PIPA campaign, Reddit cofounder, RSS, Demand Progress, Avaaz, etc...:<p>Aaron Swartz's funeral is on Tuesday. Here are details:<p>Remove United States District Attorney Carmen Ortiz from office for overreach in the case of #Aaron Swartz<p>----<p>Guerilla Open Access Manifesto<p>Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.<p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable.<p>""I agree,"" many say, ""but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal  there's nothing we can do to stop them."" But there is something we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back.<p>Those with access to these resources  students, librarians, scientists  you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not  indeed, morally, you cannot  keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral  it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it  their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.<p>With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge  we'll make it a thing of the past.

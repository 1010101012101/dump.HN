I think outsourcing to get it to releasable state is very good option. Your focus should be managing the product expectations and seeking your next round of funding, not coding. In addition, think about the fact that your Django developer still owns 35% equity even after leaving you high and dry. I recommend taking a corporate attorney's advice on how you can get her to give you back that stake or start another company.",1210236921

Definitely you are commited with your project, and I hope that will be the key for your success.<p>Developing the app yourself it's not an option, unless you have a decent background in programming, with obviously it's not the case. Some knowledge of how things work may be worthwhile, though.<p>You need to find a good developer: if he or she is in the US, India or Europe is irrelevant. The problem is you can't know if someone is good developer or not, as you are not one yourself. A safe bet would be an entrepeneur with experience who could show you his past work but it will be expensive so definitely you need to raise more money.<p>It's easier to find an undergraduate willing to do the job but that will be like playing the russian roulette, may be it will work but may be it won't.<p>Something I don't understand is: what are you have been doing in the last year? If you don't code, and you don't have customers yet, Why did you quit your job?",1210236254

184325,story,,,33,85,jfornear,"Startup crisis. Dorm room style. ",,"This is a joke compared to drinko's story, but I've really gotten myself into a bit of a bind lately. I'm hoping you guys might help me. I'll start with the background story...<p>One of my roommates is a film student, and he is taking a class in the film school on Internet media this semester. The class is brand new and has never been offered before. They basically spent the entire semester going over web 2.0 buzzwords (blog, wiki, mash-ups, news feed, beta, social bookmarking, social network, RSS, etc). They were also assigned to come up with a ""cool idea for a website"" for their final grade, and they are actually expected to develop this site.<p>My roommate's group quickly found they had no idea where to start. He came to me with some questions, and at first I was glad to help him. I started by walking him through the steps involved in purchasing the domain name and hosting plan. Then he started asking more questions, and I eventually had to tell him that I didn't have time to help him all the time and that the class was just ridiculous.<p>A week later he tells me that he wants to pay me to work on his project. All I would have to do was make a working prototype. At the time it didn’t sound like a bad idea, and it sounded like fun. I thought I could make some money and help a friend out, and I would be able to copy and paste code from other things I have worked on to cover the majority of the project. So I told him I would charge $20/hr, and I agreed to a cap of $400 since it was coming out of his pocket.<p>Then a few days later, he comes into my room with a stack of papers. It turns out to be a 17-page contract that his dad, who happens to be a lawyer, wrote up. The contract would give my roommate full ownership of the code, ip, license, etc, and all for only $20/hr with a cap of $400. It also states that I would not be a partner or have any equity. I scan it over and quickly decide that there is no way I am going to sign it (and I still haven’t). Not to mention that I was just scared of a 17-page contract and feeling a little outgunned when his dad is a lawyer.<p>So a week later, he doesn’t seem to care that I didn’t sign his dad’s contract, and he pays me for the first couple of things he needed to meet in-class deadlines.<p>Now, the project is looking really good, and I’m starting to think that their idea combined with my awesomeness might actually have potential. What should I do?<p>I feel like I am too easy to take advantage of, and I wish I knew the rules on the legal side of things much better.",1210235979

It’s a fiendishly complicated task that requires great adaptability creativity. Rules can only get you so far. No amount of advice can guarantee you success. Sometimes, the rules fail, and you need to adapt to those situations and do what needs to be done, even if it flies in the face of accepted wisdom. For every rule of product development, there is a dozen examples of teams which did it differently and still succeeded.""",1210235663

184319,comment,183466,183466,0,0,miked,,,"""In retrospect, I believe that my upbringing in a socialist-oriented family steeped in a class struggle view of society taught me that authorities would often have a different view of right and wrong than mine.""<p>Well, it didn't make my father-in-law independent. He was a leader in the fight against the Japanese, was shot and left for dead, but recovered thanks to a brilliant doctor. As a reward, after the war he was appointed photography editor of the PLA's offical newspaper. During the Cultural Revoultion, they threw him into a reeducation camp for supposedly making a joke about Mao. I wonder if the people who fed him his one egg a week cooked in used motor oil had any trouble obeying orders? After all, most of them were raised in ""socialist-oriented families"". What about the secret policemen in Cuba? What about Mussolini, whose father was a member of the Communist Internationale and whose famous son was first elected to parliment as a member fo the Socialist Party? Was that enough of a ""socialist-oriented family""? Or the Hilter Youth of the National Socialist German Workers Party? The hangmen of the Ayatollah Khomeini's ""Islamic Socialism"", stringing up a fresh batch of gays? Mugabe's goons murdering political opponents in Zimbabwe? What about Danny Ortega's goons  murdering Moskito Indians in Nicarauga -- any trouble following orders there? Saddam Hussain's Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party? Soviet soldiers starving 20 million Kulaks to death by withholding their grain and movement privileges (hello Wlater Duranty and the New York Times!)? The Cambodian language teacher turned Khmer Rouge prison director who meticulously corrected the confession of an inmate while the guards in the next room poured gasoline into her vagina and ignited it? Obiedient socialists all.<p>Speaking of social experiments, you don't often get a chance to control for nearly all variables when comparing outcomes among large groups of people. Compare East Germany to West, North Korea to South, Taiwan and Hong Kong versus China on the amount of ""obiedience to authority"". Same culture, language, history, geography, weather, genetics.<p>""This is not to say that membership in the Communist Party made me or anyone else totally independent.""<p>Oh, he's quite wrong there. One last bit of history that you've never heard cuz it's just too darned trivial. A bit of background: Human feces is valuable to Chinese peasents, as they often use it as fertilizer. During the Great Leap Forward, my wife's cousin was found by the side of the road, several leaves in his hand wrapped around something. Puzzled, they opened it up to see what was inside. It was all he had left in the world. He was quite independent from that point on, as he and 77 million other Chinese never needed anything from anyone ever again.<p>Stalin once said that one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. But then, he and all the people who obeyed him would know, wouldn't they?",1210235405

If you search for horror stories, you'll find lots of merchants who signed up for these services who didn't read the fine print about their money being tied up, and complain loudly that the processor should have told them something that important.<p>You can get out in front of the process with these processors by talking to them. let them knwo that you're about to launch, or offer discounts or whatever, so your spike in volume doesn't look suspicious. That the in-depth approval process as soon as you can. They want to be your partner, but there are rules and laws that they're not going to bend or break for you.<p>BONUS: one of the reasons that credit cards don't like to be used for crowdsourced funding sites is that there is no guarantee that a good or service will change hands, and therefore they have a harder time telling legit crowdfunding from money laundering ""oops, sorry guys, or idea flopped. thanks for the $200 thousand dollars!""",1351633823

You can observe quantum effects with 100 atom molecules the same way as with single particles, it's just they require far finer observations to detect.  If no collapse occurs, the the time entangled complexes reach visible scales there's no way you could ever detect the quantum interference.<p>It isn't that the universe has split, it's that one section of the universe's wavefunction has split, or more exactly become a bimodal distribution.  At both locations there are bunches of the wavefunction corresponding to both possible observations - but both locations are entangled since the two particles that touched this off were.  That means that when you observe the two experiments you don't ""split"" into four, but only into two since they are already entangled and you only get entangled with this complex once.  The information of ""What's entangled with what"" spread at strictly sub-light speeds, and the information of ""Did it pass through the polarizing filter or not"" also traveled at sub-light speeds.",1351633273
4719817,comment,4718497,4718497,8,0,Xcelerate,,,"The way that I best understand quantum entanglement (and maybe someone like jessriedel can correct me if I'm wrong) is thus:<p>You may be familiar with the Schrodinger equation (H = ih' d/dt) or the more accurate time-dependent Dirac equation.  In each of these equations is a function called the wavefunction (denoted with ).  This function represents the ""quantum state"" of your system -- in other words, all the information that exists within a system.   evolves deterministically in time.  You can apply an operation to this function, and when you do, you get the original function back multiplied by some value.  There are different operators, each corresponding to an ""observable"" (the thing you measure in the lab).  For example, you can measure momentum, position, energy, spin etc... and each of these observables has a different corresponding mathematical operation that you perform on  to get X, where X is the mean value of the observable.<p>Now in QM textbooks, you'll frequently see  written as (r, t), where r is a position vector and t is time.  r denotes the position of whatever particle constitutes your system.  So what if you have a two particle system like hydrogen (proton and electron) or positronium (positron and electron)?  Well, a QM textbook will write the state of your quantum system as 1 * 2 and <i>completely</i> gloss over the fact that this approximation <i>does not apply</i> in all situations.  It is physically inaccurate to say that  of two particles is two individual 's multiplied together.  For some systems, it is a good approximation and makes things easy to calculate, but in reality, there is really only one wavefunction  and it is a function of all the particles in the universe.<p>So now you can see where entanglement comes in.  If  is a wavefunction of all extant particles, then surely there will be correlations between every measurement of  that you take!  Now most of the time, you can't find correlations -- too many particles are affecting too many other particles (<i>decoherence</i>).  But if you prepare two of them together and keep outside particles from interfering with them, then you can observe the correlations between two particles no matter what the distance!<p>So now for the whole ""information transfer"" business.  I said earlier that applying an operator to  gives you the value of an observable -- what you measure.  The weird thing though is that what you measure isn't always exactly this value.  Instead, the <i>mean</i> value of many measurements will be this value.  You can also compute the standard deviation of these measurements using , but that's about it.  Nobody knows where the random ""noise"" in measurements comes from.  So far, it seems as though our universe just has some randomness inherent to it (and we're quickly ruling out all remaining superdeterministic theories; Gerard t'Hooft seems to be a hold-out: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/34217/why-do-people-categorically-dismiss-some-simple-quantum-models"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/34217/why-do-peop...</a>)<p>So you can't control or predict the individual measurements to as much precision as you'd like.  Sucks, huh?<p>Anyway, you can plot and analyze this data, and what you'll notice for two entangled particles separated by thousands of miles or more is that there are <i>statistical correlations</i> between the two sets of data (again, data you can't control -- if you can't control it, you can't send information with it).<p>Obviously, you need both sets of data to notice that there are correlations.",1351633259

Current arm chips for example often have the PSMI ""bus"" which is used both for pseudo-static memory and sometimes people hook up LCD controllers to that bus.<p>AMD is big enough to create a market for such flash controllers. And they could put hooks in the TLB such that a cache line fetch from that space could happen asynchronously with other stuff going on. I've got core memory planes that have slower read speeds than flash, I know its possible to make it work :-) But as you (wmf) point out it hasn't been done yet (other than internal NAND flash for embedded devices)<p>So if I were writing up the MRD or PRD [1] for the controller chip I'd start with provides a multi-channel way of doing load and store of program data at the cache line level.

4719767,comment,4710215,4719122,2,0,johncoltrane,,,"Let's go for another long comment.<p>1. I've seen that """". I think it's an horrible UI as it is always at different horizontal positions forcing me to move my eyes a lot more than necessary. That symbol is also almost completely devoid of information: the number of folded lines and a sample are often useful and I can't get that with """". Except if I take my mouse and hover on that """" to preview my 50 or 100 folded lines cramped in a huge ass popin. Contrast that with a regular fold in Vim: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/WXg1p.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/WXg1p.png</a><p><pre><code>  * it is easy to find\n  * it is easy to parse\n  * it shows the number of hidden lines\n  * it takes only one line\n  * its purpose is obvious\n</code></pre>\n2. Vim as signs for errors and fold indicators, there are plugins that show marks, too. A ""fold"" sign in the gutter is mainly useful if it's hard to notice the fold in the editor space. Because it's hard to spot """" folds you scan the gutter to locate folds. Because it's hard to miss a fold in vim, such an indicator is not <i>needed</i>. But Vim's foldcolumn not only shows the location of a fold: it provides an additional information that no right pointing triangle or boxed plus sign can show: the depth of the fold. Anyway, if you only care about seeing folds in the gutter, well that's covered too by the simple fact that the whole line is highligted.<p>3. I also work on small projects (under 50/60 files without assets) and everything in CtrlP is instantaneous. We obviously have very different sthetic preferences: I find everything in ST2 absolutely hideous. The font size tricks in ctrl+p you describe are both very arbitrary, simplistic and distracting. Vim's CtrlP shows the paths of the matched files, highlights the matched characters and systematically puts the default match at the bottom. There's nothing hard about it: simple, clear, fast and, again, it has lots more features than its ST2 ""counterpart"". Not to forget Vim's native wildmenu which also shows the path and highlights your choice in a very readable manner.<p>I don't agree with your last paragraph as well.<p>I really really really don't care if or why people don't like Vim. I chose it over dozens of editors/IDE because it worked for me: not because it was fashionable, not because I mistook it for something else. I have no stake in this, I don't root for Vim, I don't want more users, I don't want less users, I just don't care if it's easier, harder or whatever. I'm perfectly fine with Vim in its current state and I'm persuaded it doesn't need any of those pseudo-refinements. Vim is the work of love of a bunch of talented programmers with an unbelievable ecosystem. It's free in every meaning of the world, it's old and a lot more powerful than any other editor, with the possible exception of Emacs. Its core developpers and, I believe, many users certainly prefer Vim as it is and don't care at all about making it easier for new users. More attention, more users all of that is necessary for Panic, MacRabbit, Macromates or SublimeHQ because that's the only way they can survive. They desperately <i>need</i> differentiating ""features"" to attract new users or justify license upgrades and make more money: skeuomorphic UI, rounded rectangles, gradients, transitions, integration with this or that trendy language or framework and so on. None of that matters to Vim and its developers and lots of its users.<p>ST2's author is probably happier each time a Vim user switches to ST2 but Bram Moolenaar most certainly doesn't give a flying fuck. That's very important and that has to be considered when talking about cosmetic ""enhancements"" or ""fixes"" to Vim.",1351632670

4719756,comment,4718614,4718614,10,0,robomartin,,,"I just can't get excited about developing for Windows anything these days. And mind you, I've been using PC's almost exclusively for a very long time. Somehow, somewhere MS lost it's way.  Some might argue that it never had a ""way"".  That's fine.  I don't care.  I've made a lot of money using MS products and the Linux world probably wouldn't exist without the commodity hardware created by the MS ecosystem.  Credit where it is due.<p>It's hard to argue with the assertion that MS has failed to be a thought and technology leader for a long --long-- time.  And so, when they roll out Windows Vista, 7 and then 8 and then Metro and Windows Phone 8 and they keep, well, fucking it up...<p>I am not in love with Apple.  Not by a long-shot.  They are user-friendly and developer-hostile.  And they make dumbshit moves of monumental proportions too (Maps, anyone?).  Still, for a new or even an existing venture, I can't see considering doing mobile development much outside the iOS ecosystem.<p>In other words, in order to gain real traction and find a market it is a no-brainer that you should develop the app/service/product for iOS.  Somewhere in the adoption curve it might make sense to deploy to Android and a far, far distant third might be WP8.<p>What would  MS have to do to change that sentiment?  I don't know.<p>On the tech front I really do like the idea of my phone, tablet and desktop playing nice with each other. Or having mountable file system access to my phone and tablet.  But that's a geek thing.  Grandma doesn't give a shit.  She doesn't even know.  So, I'll count myself out as a ""typical customer"" --whatever the hell that might be.<p>Market penetration might be the key here.  Nobody, outside of tech circles --and barely at that-- is talking about WP8 or MS tablets.  The Surface commercials I saw are retarded, to say the least.  To take a stab at my ""what can they do?"" question, I'd say:  They have to fire their entire marketing department and bring fresh thinking into the organization.  The technology is probably good-to-excellent.<p>EDIT: An example of the brain-dead marketing is the commercial that spends tons of time highlighting the desktop stand flap on Surface.  Really?  You (MS) really think that you are going to get me to buy Surface over iPad because of a frigging plastic flap?  Fire them all!  They are a bunch of morons.<p>They've enjoyed market supremacy for so long that they've never really had to be good at marketing. It's the old ""You don't get fired for buying IBM"" saying from the mainframe days.  MS has always sucked at marketing.  Apple has always owned them on that front.  Now Apple makes a dumbshit move (Maps, anyone) or two and neither MS nor Google have any semblance of a fine-tuned marketing drive to take advantage of it.<p>So, when faced with such marketing incompetence I, as a developer, look at the situation and conclude that I have to stay with the company that is better at selling.  If you are good at selling you can sell pet rocks.  If you suck at it you are selling polished gravel.  The quality of the rocks doesn't matter.<p>It's not a chicken-and-egg situation.  It is a very clear market dominance and financial-risk situation.  I have zero interest in taking the financial risk to participate in an offering that is marketed, sold an supported in a half-assed fashion.<p>So, yeah, great Developer Platform.  I'm a business man.  Show me the market opportunity and I'll carve code into stone tablets in hex if it is worth my while.  Anything else is just bullshit.",1351632552

It does not matter that you don't have to click through it when downloading GPL'd software, because it's only important when you want to distribute software. And in that case the default under copyright law would be ""you don't have any right to distribute"". The GPL grants you the right to distribute the software under specific conditions. So when making GPL software available for others you can either agree to the GPL or you are simply in violation of copyright.<p>Secondly, the ""this or any later version"" is again quite different. It allows you to distribute the given software under the current or any later version of the licence, but since you have the choice of which version to use, a new version cannot retroactively restrict your rights (e.g. if GPLv4 doesn't allow you something that GPLv3 does, you can simply keep distributing under GPLv3 if the original software said ""GPLv3 or later""). As long as you comply with the version that <i>you</i> choose when distributing, you're fine. I don't think any court would find a problem with that, as you can't be surprised by someone else retroactively reducing your rights.",1351631781

There are packages such as fluentd and logstash that provide this type of functionality, but not all in one place.<p>2. As a multi-tenant SaaS offering, we have some extra requirements around authentication and security.<p>3. We want to absolutely minimize the effort needed to install the daemon. Ideally, for most users, the steps would be ""download archive, extract archive, invoke setup script"".  The more dependencies (e.g. Ruby) we incur, the harder it is to keep installation clean and reliable across distros.<p>4. We also want to make management (starting, stopping, troubleshooting) as simple as possible. This calls for minimizing layers that might add their own log output or separate log files, separate processes, etc.<p>So, while we might borrow ideas or even (license permitting) code from existing projects, we expect to have to do some reworking.

This article says its realism - but as far as I know there is no way to prove its realism and not one of the others.  One of these cannot hold:<p>- Realism, Locality, or Separability<p>Realism - Einstein's idea of 'elements of reality' - the idea that things actually are material and unchanging.  Their properties are constant unless acted upon (ie a Hydrogen atom at time1 and point1 has a constancy of properties at time2 and point2).  You could imagine a universe that had, as a property of the universe, atoms change mass every other day - just for the hell of it.<p>Locality - The idea that a system can only be affected by things within its lightcone - no effect can travel faster than the speed of light.  And two objects must be 'local' before they can interact.<p>Separability - any system separated by non-trivial space/time can be considered independent of each other.  The idea that 1/2mv^2 does not include every other part of the universe in trying to figure out what m or v are.  Not quite the same as locality - as it would still require local interactions, but that net of interactions could be so thick and pervasive as to prevent any meaningful isolation of any system.<p>As is stated above, these concepts fall out of the EPR experiment.",1351631264

Focus is a good thing when you're as small as AMD, but it doesn't seem like they've done too well in the x86 or high-end graphics markets since then either.  Of course, their game of CEO musical chairs suggests that the effect of any particular business decision may be swamped by general mismanagement.<p>> Nvidia's trickle-down approach of putting really old desktop GPUs in a mobile SoC doesn't seem to be doing very well.<p>Granted, not having unified shaders and some other niceties has been pretty weak, but I think an even larger factor may be the content problem they face.  The dominant mobile GPUs (and most importantly, the mobile GPUs in the market-creating, market-leading iOS devices) use a tile-based, or chunker, architecture where the GPU renders one chunk of the screen at a time.  Nvidia GPUs don't; they render the whole screen at once.  Nvidia believes their architecture is better; I tend to agree for desktop/console content and in a ""pure"" technical sense I suppose.  The problem is that the vast majority of mobile game content has been optimized to work well on chunker GPUs, so any performance advantage Nvidia might see vanishes, and their power efficiency suffers slightly.<p>They can overcome this structural disadvantage by (1) adopting a chunker architecture, (2) encouraging developers to make games that work better or look cooler on Tegra [1], or (3) capturing a bunch of market share by building a better overall platform, and making Tegra the default target for developers.  They could also just build a GPU that's sufficiently better than PowerVR/Mali/Exynos/Adreno in other respects that the tile-based/non-tile-based divide matters less.<p>For what it's worth, it's hard to compare mobile SoCs from a pure-technical-goodness standpoint, because their designers have such different market positions.  A5X's GPU will smoke Tegra at a lot of things, but a lot of that is because Apple can afford for A5X to be twice as big [2].  Nvidia's customers cannot afford a 150mm^2 chip at their current market position.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tegrazone.com/support/game-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tegrazone.com/support/game-support</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_system_on_chips"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_system_on_chips</a>",1351631119

This is pretty clear when you consider that they immediately jump to blame Iran, who has done an astonishing amount of 'attacking' for not having any casualties or injuries or damages of any form, real or imagined, if you listen to the Israeli government.  Like 'terrorism' in the West, 'Iran' is the magic word to get increased funding in Israel.<p>Viruses like this spread in corporations and government organizations every day in the US, Israel, and every other country on the planet.

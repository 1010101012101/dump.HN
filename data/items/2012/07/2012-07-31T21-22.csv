Is that what you call ""Cocos2D for Android""? What do you mean exactly by ""up to scratch""? Android's fragmentation is a well known problem that can't be abstracted away, but that's no reason to underestimate the value of such frameworks (it sure is a reason to avoid developing for Android though). I for one love being able to develop abd debug in MSVC on Windows, and only touch Xcode / Eclipse for platform-specific stuff.<p>As an aside, the HTML5 version of Cocos2d-x is also functional but I can't vouch for its robustness",1343771907

4319815,comment,4319250,4319683,3,0,merijnv,,,"> This is definitely the first hurdle I encounter. The handful of times I have attempted this, I end up thinking about not thinking (isn't that silly?), or a song comes into my head, or I hear a noise in the distance, and attempts to clear out those thoughts lead to, well, more thinking!<p>Warning! Completely subjective descriptions ahead:<p>In my experience the best approach to clearing your mind is not to try and actively clear your mind (i.e. thinking about not thinking) it is training yourself to let your thoughts be more transient.<p>When I try to meditate I try to let all my thoughts slip. Of course, just like you I will hear a noise or some thought tries to worm its way in, but when this happens I try to relax (physically, there is a wonderful link between relaxing your muscles and relaxing your brain. Instead of forcing your brain to relax, trick yourself by relaxing physically) and let the thought go.<p>Of course, thoughts keep floating into my mind of course, but the longer I keep the meditation up the more transient they become. At some point they even stop being thoughts because they exist to short to even have any content or feeling associated with them.<p>I have noticed that with practice the time and difficulty of achieving this transient state go down, making it easier to just start. Early on I would need to be in a quiet spot alone, nowadays I can get the process fairly far even with people in the same room talking (if not to loud).<p>Anyhoo, I hope that description maybe helps you!<p>TL;DR - You don't stop thinking or actively try to shut down your brain, you passively let your thoughts become more transient.",1343771433

4319791,comment,4319648,4319687,2,0,bfe,,,"Sorry -- here are excerpts:<p>""Imagine a pharmaceutical company 20 or 30 years from now. Moving beyond conventional drugs that interact biochemically with the body, it will have built a big bioelectronics business that treats disease through electrical signalling in the brain and elsewhere.<p>Neurological problems, from stroke and epilepsy to depression, will be treated through electronic implants into the brain rather than pills or injections. Even diabetes and obesity will be attacked in ways that seem like science fiction today, by sending electrical signals to malfunctioning cells.<p>That remarkable vision comes from one of the worlds most powerful pharmaceutical executives, Moncef Slaoui, head of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug company.<p>At present every pharmaceutical and biotech company makes chemical or biological molecules that target [biochemical] structures such as proteins in the body, said Mr Slaoui. No one is designing medicines to interact with the electrical signals that are the other language of biology.<p>With enthusiastic support from Sir Andrew Witty, his chief executive, and other senior colleagues, Mr Slaoui wants GSK to become the first large company to make bioelectronics a central plank of its long-term planning.<p>The sciences that underpin bioelectronics are proceeding at an amazing pace at academic centres around the world but it is all happening in separate places, he says. The challenge is to integrate the work  in brain-computer interfaces, materials science, nanotechnology, micro-power generation  to provide therapeutic benefit.<p>...<p>Today, only a minuscule fraction of the electrical activity in peoples brains can be read by computer. Even so, recent experiments have given spectacular results.<p>Perhaps the most remarkable was a recent US clinical trial in which tetraplegic patients used their thoughts to direct robotic arms. The research team, led by John Donoghue and Leigh Hochberg at Brown University, released a video of a 58-year-old patient called Cathy, whose mental activity drove a robot to pick up her drinking bottle from a nearby table and move it up to her mouth so that she could sip some coffee. A heartwarming smile illuminated Cathys face after she had drunk without help from a human carer for the first time in 15 years.<p>The BrainGate system developed by the Brown University team has a sensor, about the size of a small aspirin pill, with 100 hair-thin electrodes implanted into the top of the patients motor cortex, the brain area that controls movement. It is connected to an external computer, which translates the neural activity into commands to drive a robot.<p>According to another paralysed patient called Bob, hard thinking is not required: I just imagined moving my own arm and the [robotic] arm moved where I wanted it to go.<p>...<p>Some of the best bioengineers in the US, including John Rogers of the University of Illinois, Brian Litt of the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Viventi of New York University, are developing a new generation of soft computer interfaces, made with flexible silicon circuitry that can bend and stretch to match the curves of the brain.<p>...<p>Although bioelectronics research currently focuses on the brain, its potential extends much wider. Electrical signalling is not confined to the central nervous system, says Mr Slaoui. We could make use of signalling in the peripheral nervous system too.<p>...<p>The beauty of electrical signalling is that it has only a local effect, says Mr Slaoui. In contrast, even a well- targeted drug drenches the whole body in unwanted chemical.""<p>(small percentage of article excerpted under statutory fair use, 17 USC 107.)",1343771117

4319772,comment,4319250,4319567,12,0,Alex3917,,,"""What is it?""<p>There are many types of meditation which frankly don't have all that much in common. In buddhist meditation, which is probably the most common type in the US, there are two main types:<p>- Concentration meditation (shamatha): This involves training the mind to concentrate, often by focusing on a mantra, an object (like a candle), or some imaginary object (like a mandala). There are different mental states that you can reach as you get better, called jhanas.<p>- The second type of meditation is insight meditation, also called vipassana. In this type of meditation you focus on the sensations of the body. It basically involves starting at your head and noting every physical sensation (warm, cold, clothing touching your skin, etc.) and working all the way down to your toes, and then going up. As you progess you begin to notice more sensations that the buddhist mental map describes as being part of the 'subtle body'. These involve things like vibrations, electric shocks, etc. You also begin to feel waves of energy traveling up and down your body. To get to this point takes 3 or 4 days, assuming you are at a retreat where you are doing it 10 hours a day. The next step is where you can feel 'inside' of yourself, like all of your organs, and then being able to feel inside your organs until they dissolve into what feels like rising bubbles. This takes a bit longer, but you can often begin to feel these 'bubbles' after a week or so. Note that you don't have to believe in any of this, it just happens whether you want it to or not. There are many more mental states and experiences you will have if you continue. There is a description here of the rest of the states:<p><a href=""http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/Collection+of+tips+to+get+stream+entry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kennethfolkdharma.wetpaint.com/page/Collection+of+tip...</a><p>They culminate in something called stream entry, which is the first of four stages of enlightenment according to the buddhist model.<p>There is also a book called Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha which also has a description of all the things you go through between being a beginner and reaching enlightenment. The best way to learn though is probably to do a meditation retreat, there are free vipassana retreats offered by dhamma.org that are pretty good. (There is a suggested donation of about $300 to pay for your food and housing for the 10 days, but it's optional.) There are many reviews of this online. There are also many other retreats, but most of them cost money. One example of a popular one is the insight meditation society, <a href=""http://www.dharma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dharma.org/</a>.<p>There are many books also. The best one for learning vipassana is probably Mindfulness In Plain English, which you can download for free as a PDF: <a href=""http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html</a><p>While this is good to read, you really don't want to try it without a teacher, as you are likely to hurt yourself or do it wrong (and not make progress) unless you have an actual teacher.<p>The third type of meditation you hear a lot about is transcendent meditation. This is basically a form of concentration meditation, although its adherents claim it is  different based on brain scans. It costs a lot of money to learn, and many consider it to be a cult. I don't know a lot about it personally.<p>Many other religions have some form of meditation, such as catholicism. Tibetan buddhism also has its own form of meditation, as does hinduism. (Some types of yoga are basically an active form of meditation.)<p>If you're looking to learn one type then vipassana is probably the place to start. Advantages are:<p>- Free instruction, and a large community that can help you.<p>- A large encyclopedia of the different mental states you will encounter, so you know what you're experiencing and whether or not they are 'part of the path' or just a distraction.<p>- A well defined path to follow to get from a complete beginner to very advanced.<p>- What r/meditation is most familiar with, which is a great place to ask questions and such.<p>Tibetan buddism also has a very well defined path, but it's really only taught to people within the tradition, so I can't comment much on it. It's also generally hard to learn unless you happen to live in Ithaca, NY or Boulder, CO, as there aren't many tibetan llamaseries around.<p>Lastly, I should mention there is also zen meditation, which is fairly popular in the US. Zen is a lot of judaism, in that it combines certain practices with what are basically brain teasers as a way of trying to coax you toward enlightenment faster. There are all sorts of parables, commentaries, commentaries on the commentaries, etc. I don't know a ton about this, but there are all sorts of blogs and places you can learn. Anyway I'm not an expert by any means, but hopefully that helps a bit.",1343770925

The guy who taught me that it was about 'being the stillness' (I know, I know, but this was they 70's). Lets say you are looking at pond, smooth as glass and a pebble falls, ripples spread out.

If you were in a horror movie and the killer was walking in your house, you'd be scared to death trying to be invisible. That is 'being the stillness'.

We can't, normally, just turn off or on feeling sad, or being angry, or relaxed, etc. That lack of control has consequences. For example, when a person is in a heated argument the fight or flight reflex will dump adrenaline into their system and create a variety of other reactions that results in diminished rationality, aggressiveness, etc. That phenomenon is the root cause of a ton of negative behaviors in people and a reason why verbal arguments turn into verbal, and then perhaps even physical, fights instead of conversations.<p>Generally the most important transition is to a state of relaxation, since it's easier to consciously go from that state to most other mental states intentionally and it's typically harder to go to a state of relaxation from many other mental states (anger, sadness, anxiety, frustration, etc.) However, meditation isn't limited to just relaxation.",1343770379

The lower layer is an infrastructure protocol, with about as much Ethical impact as the Internet itself (to be specific, it could be compared to, say, BitTorrent.) The upper layer is where ethical responsibility comes into play.<p>We can probably convince your mother to download an app from the App Store that integrates just with the lower layer--hey, it's just like Dropbox, but bigger! [Well, as long as anyone and everyone can read random samples of your data if they like...]--because the upper layer, with the encryption and signing, will siphon off all the stigma of not-so-above-board usage of the protocol and attach it to itself. It's no different <i>technically</i>, but it is <i>very</i> different <i>socially.</i><p>The advantage of having one reviled app on a larger infrastructure is that that reviled app gets to ""hide"" its blocks among all the above-board usage of the infrastructure. Like another poster in the thread said, if you go onto Freenet or the Tor Directory, the links to CP sites are plain and obvious, because it's a large part of what's going on there. But if you could look at your own disk usage as a node in this network, I imagine the number of encrypted blocks as compared to, say, plain-old MPEG frames of TV shows, would be vanishingly small. (And it's be relatively impossible to define which is which, either, since this infrastructure has no ""index"" or metadata; it merely is a big bucket of blocks named by their content hashes, of which most--not just the encrypted ones--are meaningless unless you have another block giving the order in which to string them together to make a file.)<p> ""Anonymous, Uncensorable, Ethical: pick two.""--named after the CAP theorem of database design. Well, it would really be the AUE conjecture for now--but I'd love to see someone prove it either way; it seems like the sort of thing that is amenable to that.",1343770272

4319665,comment,4319250,4319567,5,0,doc4t,,,"I can tell you how I experienced it.<p>I did Astanga yoga (also refered to as power yoga) for many years. Such a class would consist of some 10 - 20 students and 1 - 2 instructors. In this form of yoga at no time do you close you eyes (expect for the final relaxation time).<p>Contrary to what you might think this particular form of yoga is very very psychically hard. Although you move slowly you are never still in a relaxed position. You move a lot of small muscles and carry your own weight for 1.5 - 2 hours.<p>The concentration needed takes all your focus until you know the series of movement of the back of your hand. For me this took about a year. After this I would occasionally slip into a kind of mindlessness. I would ""come back"" and be conscience about this mindlessness at some point near the end of the session. It very much felt like 1.5 hours had passed in an instance. I would not be able to recall any detail or anything the instructors have said and I would feel immensely relaxed and full of energy. It was a great sensation.<p>I suspect this has something to do with how you breath during yoga. It kind of resembles the way you breath when you are deep at sleep. It takes a long time to learn and I have a feeling that the breathing is actually the most important part of yoga.<p>Besides swimming this is by far the best workout I have ever done. Being a programmer it does wonders for a body which spends most of the time sitting down in an office chair. If you get the chance I recommend that you try it out. You will be very surprised how hard it is - and how rewarding it is.",1343769645

While some people challenge them, Google is still the objective king in searches, and companies with a huge amount of resources, like Microsoft, struggle to supplant Google in the quality of their offering.<p>Facebook is a very complex system with a lot of support for a lot of different things. Facebook is more in line with Twitter in that it's strongly dependent on network effects, but Facebook requires investment of significant time in building relationships and composing a profile; they have some reasonable sense of lock-in here. And if you've looked around, it is still difficult to develop a platform that does everything Facebook does (or more), especially with Facebook's rapid deployment of analogous features anytime a competitor tries to one-up them. They copied and thereby neutered the viability of Circles lickety-split and Google+ could no longer claim a significant feature advantage for those concerned about privacy.<p>Twitter is just a stream of short strings, easily scrapeable and convertible. The site can be cloned on a conceptual level in a couple of days. Twitter may have done some serious scaling work, but in the end they have no unique offering, no killer feature, nothing that a normal developer would have difficulty or serious effort duplicating at the conceptual level. Scalability of course takes time, but it's highly implementation dependent and occurs as necessary; Twitter's internal performance is not a serious user-facing barrier or feature.

By this time I was sitting on the bathroom floor:  I could only hear this tone and all I saw was a bright white light.  Somehow I kept my cool and could, also somehow, navigate the room.

A long time ago I took a transcendental meditation course (TM) (I know, I know, it dates me, there was a girl involved) they are (were?) the folks who claimed you could defy gravity if you were good enough. There was a lot of eastern mysticism but as the scientific type I was more interested in what, if any, physiological effects were to be had. Being an undergrad in a pre-med school has some perks and one of them was being able to practice meditation wearing an EEG cap.<p>As far as I can tell, the primary benefit of meditation is shutting down all the noise in your head. Your brain thinks a lot, about a lot of things, often all at the same time. You might be like me where you get solutions to problems that 'bubble up' from somewhere in your brain that you didn't know was working on the problem.<p>Anyway, if you meditate (and there aren't any big secrets here you are simply training yourself to stop thinking without going to sleep) you clear out your brain. Like doing a power cycle reboot on a computer. Flush everything all resources available for thinking. Then when new things come up you can respond more quickly because you've got cycles to spare.<p>My totally non-scientific theory is that normally, when you start thinking about something new, your brain has to pick something to stop thinking about so that it can free up the cycles. If you are trying to keep a lot things in your head, that is hard because you are already trying not to stop thinking about the things you need to remember. Whereas when you just come out of meditation you aren't thinking about <i>anything</i> so you can quickly pick up a new train of thought.<p>Note that this is different than sleep because when you sleep you dream, and dreaming is a way of thinking. If you're successfully meditating, you are awake, aware of your surroundings, but keeping your finger on the 'halt' button so that you don't start up new thoughts. Then you lift your finger and off you go.",1343769130

They need to make things that look and feel different than what's available (and in this sense they <i>are</i> breaking new ground in consumer design) and get a controversy stirred. As long as the new stuff is philosophically compatible with the old stuff and a credible claim to the spirit of Jobs can be established, the cult of Mac will grow until they reach some level where these dynamics go out of balance. Apple relies on its underground status for its coolness, too; if everyone had it, the many Mac denziens that want to feel special will find another obscure thing to latch onto.",1343768637

ROI metric does not have to be better than Google for an ad campaign on Facebook or Microsoft Adcenter to be profitable. I have worked with clients to use web analytics and cohort analysis to optimize both quality (higher conversion, better LTV ) and quantity of leads. Sometimes Microsoft Adcenter traffic converts better but does have sufficient quantity compared to Google Adwords. Also different ad platforms have different levels or competition as well as different levels of fraud detection and click quality. I am surprised that Facebook does not detect and suspend  obviously spammy user accounts  whether that account is bot driven or outsourced to humans overseas.Google and Facebook have financial incentives to not filter out all low quality ad traffic because many advertisers don't have expertise or time to closely examine traffic sources as the company mentioned in this news story.<p>A combination of tech expertise and marketing savvy are  needed to  reduce this problem. More analytic tools are available for Google Adwords than are available for Facebook ads.",1343768409

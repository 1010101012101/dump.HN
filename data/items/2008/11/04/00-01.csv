352779,comment,352248,352573,0,0,DaniFong,,,"It's not exactly covered convincingly though. The reason it supposedly can't transfer information is because you'd have to measure it, and we assume that measurement strictly follows Born's rules, which is a whole other can of worms. Sometimes people talk about density matrices instead, but we only use <i>those</i> since they are consistent with Born's rules. Additionally, many physicists point out that what you seem to be doing when you perform a measurement is entangling the system with the many bazillion degrees of freedom in the measurement apparatus and the world at large. We don't know, exactly, where the separation between a 'measurement-like' physical process occurs, or even if there really is one.<p>There isn't even a standard measure of entanglement for three or more particles. It's a pretty big mystery, still.",1225760311

352754,story,,,3,11,matt1,"Ask HN: What's the status of Heroku? (and other Rails hosting questions)",,"This is a followup to a previous thread (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=272031) where I asked about Rails hosting options. I'll be at a point soon with my app where I want to deploy it and am taking another look at my choices. Unfortunately, my sysadmin skills are very much lacking and while I want to learn, that's not a priority right now. That pretty much eliminates sites like Slicehost unless I want to pay someone to configure it. (I plan to learn, but taking the time to do that now will add several months onto my timeline, which I want to avoid).<p>I'm looking for a managed host and my research has led me to HostingRails and Heroku.<p>My initial impression of those two sites are:<p>Heroku - Very easy to set up and use, though I've read that they add a banner to your page unless you sign up for a premium account. I'd happily sign up and pay for one, but I don't see an option for that anywhere. Also, the fact that their site hasn't been updated in months worries me a little (correct me if I'm wrong). I'd love to support a YC company and their service looks great, but I'm hesitant.<p>HostingRails, compared to Heroku, takes a little bit more work to configure, but seems like a pretty good choice. A lot of the negative reviews are years old so its hard to tell whether the downtime issues that some complained about have been resolved. Their homepage guarantees 99.9% up time, which makes me believe that the issues are not longer major concerns. That being said, I worry that some of the positive reviews are actually staff, some parts of their website are a little sloppy, and they make you pay for a year in advance.<p>What do you guys (and gals!) think? Are there any other options I should consider?<p>Appreciate the help. (PS: I bought a Macbook yesterday per HN's advice and love it already -- thanks for the pointers!)",1225757813

352751,comment,352540,352674,0,0,geuis,,,"Your vote DOES matter, statistically speaking. Disregarding the oddness of the electoral college, in most elections where the number of votes is directly relational to the outcome of the contest, the individual statistical importance of each vote decreases as the overall volume of votes increases. In elections where fewer votes are registered, the significance of each vote on the outcome increases.<p>In an election involving hundreds of millions of people, you can claim correctly that overall influence of your vote is tiny. That does NOT mean it doesn't matter. However, to properly represent the desire of the voter pool in aggregate, all people must participate. The outcome of an election is not to decide what you individually want, its to decide what the populace in general wants.<p>As to your other political statements, some I agree with, some not. I used to be very politically active(anti-war rallies, protests, supporting local candidates, volunteering, sign waving, etc).<p>If you're from a country where you can't vote, then your opinions aren't helping your fellow man. You need to get off the computer and go stand up to your corrupt leaders. You might get shot, but when enough people stand up things change. Hey, its kind of like voting!",1225757635

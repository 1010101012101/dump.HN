Interestingly, he did not receive a bachelor's degree until the 1990's.<p>Apparently back then you only needed a high school diploma to go to law school.<p>There are a lot of things that are most efficiently learned and are useful to the world that colleges teach. It doesn't have to be just a place for future researchers, but as a society it would be useful for us to look at what we require a degree for, and figure out if that is really necessary or just a waste of time and money.<p>Of course, the money is big enough that this is unlikely to happen in a measured, sensible way.",1278313194

Each of the top 4 GOP candidates in 2008 ran as a strong man and none was elected.  Obama, meanwhile, won in the same way George W. Bush did in 2000 -- as an unproven Frodo Baggins type who inspired people who hoped he'd fill the shoes they imagined for him.<p>If Obama were serious about the issue he'd be talking about stopping offshore drilling.  Instead he's singling out BP as if there is some sort of gross negligence rather than just a low probability / high impact outcome happening.",1278313179
1487528,comment,1486708,1486708,0,0,justin_vanw,,,"I know exactly what this is like.  I was about the same age as you when I started really getting worried about the same things you are.<p>If you do everything I say here, it probably won't make you a dynamo overnight.  It will help you avoid backsliding, though.  Over the next few years, if you are diligent, you will learn new habits.<p>Step 1:  Throw your TV and any video game systems you have in the trash (or more sensibly, disconnect them and put them on craigslist so they are out of your house <i>today</i>).   The whole point of startup culture is to give up some fun now (wait, working at a startup IS fun) in exchange for a huge pile of money later.  You want to work 80+ hours a week, and probably have a girlfriend too.  When does playing Xbox fit in there?  In a few years, when you are the founder of a hot, funded startup, you can have an XBOX in your game room.  Or you can play it now, and maybe the VC fairy will be impressed by your GTA skills. -- The point is, every minute spent fucking around is a minute you could be working or learning new skills.<p>Step N: The next time you are wondering ""why can't I be productive"", imagine a little bell ringing in your head.  The bell is there to remind you to sit down and work.  If you find yourself browsing reddit or hn or some other site, add entries to your hosts file so that you CAN'T browse those sites.  Often the anxiety that keeps a person from being productive is at it's worst at exactly those times that you would otherwise be the most productive.  Never visit any distracting site like that from your work area or from your work computer.<p>Step Na: Give yourself a little goal to accomplish (write it down) when you sit down to work, and don't let yourself get up to do something else (besides restroom breaks) until you accomplish the little goal you wrote down.  When you do accomplish it, imagine another 'you' there, and see if that other 'you' would accept the quality of the work if you were an employee.  Once you give the work a thumbs up, <i>force  yourself</i> to take a 15 minute break.  Go outside for a walk, call a friend, just get off the computer.  Once you are comfortable with this micro-routine (say after 3 weeks of doing it consistently), check out GTD.  Resist the urge to go full on GTD now, however.  Most likely you will get distracted setting up notebooks and org-mode or other yak-shaving instead of getting actual work done.<p>Step X: Make an appointment with a psychiatrist that has experience treating adults with depression, ADHD and anxiety issues.  It may help a lot, and it can't hurt.",1278313157

Many people will continue to spend their lives on it. Remember music has been around long before there were ways to ""monetize"" it.<p>Moreover please realize that your HipHop millionaire and Britney Spears are anomalies in first place. For every Britney Spears you'll find ten thousands of underdog musicians who stay (often barely) afloat not by having their videos on TRL, but by playing small gigs in front of people.<p>That kind of making a living with music is not going anywhere and will, in fact, greatly benefit when the ""Great wall of EMI"" (or Universal, or Sony, or what not..) comes down.",1278313071

There are lots of front-end coders who consider this as the fun part, they like making things look good.<p>People enjoying backend programming doesn't realize this, they just think that it is the trivial part of the programming (and thus requiring a little amount of time), although totally different skills are needed.<p>Also, many UI libraries are very cumbersome for this kind of microtweaking. CSS is very good for it, but you still encounter lots of problems when you try to make just small change.",1278313057
1487524,comment,1485922,1486972,0,0,thm76,,,"I think what Apple is doing usually, and I think that's one of the points Marco is making in the article, is that they only add features when they can get them working very well.<p>They didn't have a use for a front facing camera, or could make it easy enough to use, so they didn't include one. Now they have one because they were finally able to implement video chat in an easy to use way (Face Time).<p>They didn't have copy and paste until they figured out how to make it as elegant and easy to use as it is.<p>They didn't include 3G in the original iPhone because it would have affected battery life too much.<p>They only introduced the SDK once the API was in a usable state and they got the necessary documentation and infrastructure in place to support 3rd party developers.<p>Face Time currently only works on WiFi, but from what I read about it it actually works for Joe Average. On other phones you have to be a geek to figure out which software to install and how to set it up.<p>For some people it is certainly valuable to have barely working bleeding edge features on the phone, but for the 99% of users out there who're not interested in tinkering with their phone Apple's approach makes a lot more sense, IMO.",1278312998

1487521,comment,1486708,1487180,0,0,BipolarBob,,,"Funny this should come up because I'm also a 23 year old university student (undergrad) and I started medication for bipolar II a week and a half ago.<p>I've had similar problems with focus and discipline. I've tried alleviating them by exercising (working out with the ROTC at 6 AM), eating well, making important commitments, doing Buddhist mindfulness exercises, listening to Eckhart Tolle, writing myself a contract that I signed in front of my friends/classmates, trying to create a startup with some good friends, and many other things that typically ended in (painful) failure. I had successes here and there, but the mental  effort required to hang on until the end was often huge.<p>I have the tendency to make commitments and create relationships when I'm in one of my highs, and then proceed to fumble them when I inevitably reach a low. I dropped 2 semesters of college before I looked for professional help.<p>I started by seeing a therapist, not an MD. I found the sessions beneficial and they helped me get through a rough patch, but after two months things weren't really coming together. At my therapist's discretion, I saw a psychiatrist. I told him my situation in it's entirety. I didn't let myself think about trying to save face. I told him the grittiest details if I thought they were important for him to understand what I was going through.<p>I definitely had strong misgivings before making that step. For me the worst was ""What if everyone goes through the same difficulties, and I'm just weak and cowardly?"" However, my track record clearly showed I needed help. It was mostly a matter of allowing myself to be humble enough to accept it.<p>After only a week and a half of taking Seroquel, it's hard for me to say how it's going and where it's going to take me. Early though it is, I've noticed a change for the better. I like to think it's a temporary solution, like the way that you would put a tarp over a hole in your roof before you actually get it repaired.<p>Psychiatrists and therapists see people for things like this all the time. It's familiar territory for them. I could have saved myself a lot of heartache if I'd gotten professional help sooner.<p>Best of luck<p>- Another dude",1278312921

1487518,comment,1486594,1487114,0,0,klodolph,,,"By this same logic I could argue that no scientist is Christian, and no Christian is a scientist.<p>Ask any scientist who is Christian, ""does a good scientist believe claims that cannot be independently verified?""  Then ask, ""do you believe in god?""  The questions ""are you a good scientist?"" and ""can the existence of god be independently verified?"" follow.<p>You'll force this poor scientist to admit they're not a good scientist, or perhaps as a compromise you can say that the existence of god is a hypothesis which they have not yet been able to test to their satisfaction (which doesn't sound like belief to me).<p>Okay, that's actually not the most common result (I might expect a lecture on politesse, or perhaps a simple request to shut my trap).  But I find it detestable to go around and tell people that they label themselves wrong, e.g., ""You are not a true atheist.""  It's almost as villainous to say things like ""Strong atheists do not exist."" when there are plenty of people who claim to be strong atheists.  Say instead something like, ""strong atheism is not a tenable position.""  Or, ""strong atheism is logically inconsistent.""  Then, at least, I won't think of you quite so poorly, and we can argue logic instead of identity.<p>For the record, I'm positive that there are many good scientists who are also Christians.  I'm also positive that there are many strong atheists.<p>P.S.  It's bad enough that as a bisexual male I don't exist, but as a strong atheist too I doubly don't exist.  Harsh.",1278312845

But seeing a psychologist has been one of the best things I've ever done for myself.<p>The thing is, bipolar disorder can get worse over time.

I left the article feeling that Eleanor (the defiant teenager) was particularly well-spoken, and that Jason Robert Brown would love for me to get off his lawn.  I don't know him, but now I'm prejudiced against him and his works. But he does a great job of explaining his thought process, whether one agrees with it or not.  And better understanding those with whom one disagrees is a good thing.<p>I thought the weakest part was his attempt to make it a clear-cut case of right and wrong, and then go on to give some very muddy examples that really haven't been clearly decided: ""I then ripped that CD on to my hard drive so I can listen to it on my iPod in my car. Well, that's not FAIR, right? I should have to buy two copies? No. There is in fact a part of the copyright law that allows exactly this; it's called the doctrine of fair use.""<p>Logical, I'd agree, but he might want to discuss this with the RIAA, who argue that it's not fair-use, and merely an example of their forbearance not to sue for such petty infringement: 'there’s no legal ""right"" to copy the copyrighted music on a CD onto a CD-R. However, burning a copy of CD onto a CD-R, or transferring a copy onto your computer hard drive or your portable music player, won’t usually raise concerns...'

He trades fair-use under copyright for exclusive rights to distribution.  Inevitability aside, 'hostile young men' of HN, what's the flaw with this reasoning?

I typically describe shintoism as similar to native american religions and/or paganism. People here in Japan seem to practice shintoism more as a set of cultures and customs than what a westerner would describe as a religion.<p>There is a belief in good and bad fortune which can be altered by prayer to various spirits. The shrine sells lots of trinkets to help improve your luck in various aspects of your life. It reminds me a bit of Catholics who keep a St. Christopher trinket in their car for safe travels. At the shrine where I got married, it was discovered that there was a ""power spot"" on a path behind the shrine: a little puddle of water from a nearby spring. People would line up to take a turn standing in front of it and say a prayer.<p>We visit our local shrine on holidays, mostly because it is fun and peaceful. Sometimes there are festivals with good food, drink and music. People here will celebrate and visit a church, a temple (buddhist), or a shrine (shinto) without really seeing that there might be inconsistency.

Harshly grading grammar mistakes <i>discourages</i> people from pushing at the limits of their ability, because it rewards using only words and grammatical constructions that the student is completely confident in. The goal of any language course should be to encourage as much real language use as possible, because that’s the only way to real fluency, including fluency with correct grammar constructions.<p>The knowledge of the year the first Punic War began will be learned pretty well if you go read 50 letters written during the first Punic War, instead of looking at dates on flash cards.

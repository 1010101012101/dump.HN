The data is about 700 GB compressed, but unfortunately you have to download each filing individually from their FTP server. When I first started, I wrote a script that would download the filing and then process it into the format I wanted. However their FTP server is very slow and there are 15 million individual downloads, so it was taking forever. Rather I wrote a script that mirrored the FTP server to S3 as fast as possible while still being respectful to their bandwidth and server capacity. And this still took almost 3 weeks.<p>Now I have a &quot;data lake&quot; of raw SEC filings and other data which I can pull from at any time on S3.

9798410,comment,9793763,9798302,0,0,pron,,,"> Any sufficiently advanced distributed systems contains a buggy implementation of Erlang?<p>Why won&#x27;t you say that about machine code? The JVM simply operates at a lower level than Erlang, hence it can be used to implement Erlang, and, it turns out that doing so might gives better results than current Erlang VMs implemented in C, because there are man-decades (or centuries) of shared functionality that&#x27;s already in the JVM.<p>> By rewriting (or heavily reconfiguring) the GC, adding a scheduler, etc<p>You don&#x27;t need to rewrite or heavily configure the GC (besides, which one? There are plenty of JVM GCs) -- just to use it as Erlang does, or one that is pauseless no matter how you use it (two implementations, one commercial and one open-source under development at Red Hat). Also, you don&#x27;t need to add a scheduler. One of the world&#x27;s best implementations of a work-stealing scheduler, also with about a decade of effort behind it by Doug Lea, is packaged with the JDK. See here[1] to get a feel for the effort behind it.<p>> It sounds like it&#x27;s not quite the case, especially around distributed systems.<p>Erlang doesn&#x27;t add anything not already found in high-quality, battle-tested libraries like JGroups[2] when it comes to clustering (actually, JGroups is more powerful than Erlang&#x27;s clustering). The JVM ecosystem is so huge that it&#x27;s very hard to come up with something (other than syntax) that doesn&#x27;t already have a solid implementation out there.<p>I&#x27;d really like to retrofit Erjang to use Quasar rather than Kilim (Quasar is just better maintained, more battle-tested and probably faster).<p>I really believe that running Erlang on the JVM is a win for everyone. The Erlang community simply doesn&#x27;t have a tenth of the resources that are put into OpenJDK[3].

There are always going to be ambiguity in legal matters, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t greatly reduce that ambiguity with good tools.<p>I know this is a really tall order, but one idea in particular I&#x27;d like to see is the introduction of some sort of unit testing or model checking during the legislative process where legal scenarios are parameterized and enumerated to act as a guide for legislators, lawyers and judges.  I&#x27;d love to see something like Alloy (<a href=""http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/</a>) be implemented in a way that non-programmers could use to model check things like bylaws by guiding the user through ambiguous and conflicting scenarios.  I&#x27;m not suggesting we try to make laws satisfiable.  What I am suggesting is that we model them in a way that highlight and distinguish the laws that are poorly crafted from those which are clearly interpreted.<p>Legal ambiguity is really expensive weight on our society.  Not only does this sort of ruling create investment uncertainty, it benefits incumbents who can buy armies of lawyers and intimidate competitors with drawn out lawsuits.  Our legal system should be the great equalizer, but it will never be as long as we let judges and lawyers convince us to resign that our current system &quot;is as good as it gets&quot;.",1435588597

You may consult the &quot;Fault Tree Handbook&quot; also known as NUREG-0492 which can be found here:<p><a href=""http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr0492/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/s...</a><p>It has been adopted in parts of the auto industry for at least a decade (I was directly exposed to this).<p>You start with a preliminary hazard analysis based on what could go wrong and work backward through the system to identify things connected to the component in question that would lead to the undesired outcome. You&#x27;ll build a large binary circuit where the inputs are events or problems and the output is a failure. The tools can do an analysis to determine what combinations can lead to that failure. If the simplified boolean expression contains any single terms, you have a single point of failure that will lead to the undesired outcome. You then redesign the system so that no single point failures lead to disaster.<p>THIS ANALYSIS HAS TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU BUILD IT TO BE ANY GOOD.<p>I always liked this way better than the more common &quot;faulure modes and effects analysis&quot; or FMEA, which makes you try to determine system-wide consequences of component failures - often down to individual resistors. These do find problems at design time, but IMHO it&#x27;s too much work. With a fault tree you get to treat larger assemblies as a component.",1435588155

Overpressure in the LOX tank could be due to 1) failure to vent properly or 2) something heating it up.<p>Option 1 is based on the fact that it&#x27;s constantly evaporating and needs to vent. This seems really unlikely given that it passed all test on the pad 2 minutes before. It also sounds like this was likely ruled out based on Elon&#x27;s tweet about a &quot;counter intuitive cause&quot;.<p>Option 2 sounds like fire or flames due to fuel leakage or something, but then realize that this is the second stage and all the action is going on 100 or more feet down in the first stage. They also have a camera on the 2nd stage engine which was shown shortly before the incident and nothing was going on in there.

The leap second is added because our concept of time is slightly off, but it keeps being presented as if we had to add an extra second because of the slowing of the rotation.  If that was the case, it would be like those 2 hours that were added in the last few million years.  We don&#x27;t consider them leap years because they aren&#x27;t a correction but a redefinition (ignore for a moment that humans weren&#x27;t around to define as a day as 22 hours back then).<p>Consider the leap year for a second.  We add it because our years have 365 days is slightly incorrect (by about .25 days a year).  It isn&#x27;t that the number of rotations per revolution is or isn&#x27;t changing.  That isn&#x27;t relevant to our use of a 1 day correction every 4 years.  If some force caused us to revolve around the sun slightly faster and it took 365 exact, then we could remove the leap year.<p>Removing the leap year would be a result of our revolution being slightly faster.

Every data item should have a clear trace to what system it came from and when the data was produced. The data lake thus contains a historical record. This might come from feeding Domain Events into the lake, a natural fit with Event Sourced systems. But it could also come from systems doing a regular dump of current state into the lake - an approach that&#x27;s valuable when the source system doesn&#x27;t have any temporal capabilities but you want a temporal analysis of its data. A consequence of this is that data put into the lake is immutable, an observation once stated cannot be removed (although it may be refuted later), you should also expect ContradictoryObservations.<p>> The data lake is schemaless, it&#x27;s up to the source systems to decide what schema to use and for consumers to work out how to deal with the resulting chaos. Furthermore the source systems are free to change their inflow data schemas at will, and again the consumers have to cope. Obviously we prefer such changes to be as minimally disruptive as possible, but scientists prefer messy data to losing data.<p>So basically, a data lake is a fancy word for a file system?",1435586496

Glassdoor, an employment site, lists more than 7,300 openings for software engineers, ahead of job openings for nurses,</i><p>This agree with the post-2008 hollowing out of the middle theme - lots of of opportunities for high-IQ employment (coders) and the polar opposite: low-paid service workers and bedpan changers. It&#x27;s like if you&#x27;re IQ is not in the top quartile, go directly to the low-income, do not go pass go, do not collect $60-100k a year.<p>I&#x27;m very suspicious of the claim that these boot camps can turn novices into job-ready professionals in just 3 months.  There&#x27;s too much to learn and unless you&#x27;re one of those high-IQ people who has an aptitude for math, as the example in the article, you won&#x27;t be competent enough get a job and, to make things worse, you&#x27;ll also be out $10,000.<p>Instead, if you&#x27;re not smart enough to work in tech, take that $10k and buy Facebook, Google, Amazon or QQQ stock using in-the-money-call options. You can leverage 5-1 and make $30k a year from a $10k account doing this. The tech boom has much further to go.

9964811,comment,9962913,9964543,0,0,Symmetry,,,"I think IBM found that the last level cache in their Power7 CPUs were faster with eDRAM than with SRAM because the reduction in transmission latency enabled by the smaller size made up for the higher cell latency so that&#x27;s probably the crossover point where cell density wins over reasonable cell latencies.  Of course memories with very large latency operations like a Flash erase can still dominate at much large sizes.  And for off-die memory the transport is going to mask most differences anyways.<p>The various sort of stacked memory coming into commercial use have the potential to reduce interconnect power and potentially make active RAM power at least slightly relevant.  But I think the interesting thing about reducing RAM power consumption is decreasing passive power.  Not that I expect anything to come of it for at least another half decade.",1438120666

Apparently my instincts were good, so before surfacing I swam away from the non-swimming adult who had just descended a ladder and grabbed the first thing that came to hand. Apparently the buoyancy she got from me was enough to get her back to the ladder.

9964715,comment,9964521,9964521,0,0,alkonaut,,,"> There&#x27;s no place in our processes for cleaning up technical debt.<p>That&#x27;s the thing with agile, it only works well if you have 2 things:<p>1) &quot;An agile codebase&quot; with good tests, and little technical debt. It&#x27;s very hard to adopt an agile process on existing code which doesn&#x27;t meet these standards.<p>2) A process that has a Definition-of-Done which includes that there is no added tech debt. Ideally code should be peer reviewed and the commits rejected if there is any smell/debt added.<p>Remember: in scrum <i>developers</i> are responsible for estimating the development cost of the stories. If you know that the story X will involve touching a piece of code that has some wrinkles, it&#x27;s <i>your</i> job to set the effort estimate <i>including</i> the cleanup time required to make the code good enough to implement the new feature on. At the top level, it&#x27;s fine to leave horrible code until there is a bug reported against it. On lower levels however, you must avoid basing new code on old bad code. An example can be in OO, if a base class has a bad design, don&#x27;t add yet another subclass to make a new feature. As part of that new feature refactor the base class and <i>all</i> existing subclasses if necessary.\nThe counterexample: if one subclass smells, leave it until there is a bug in that particular subclass. The same reasoning can be said for anything that builds on anything else. Don&#x27;t add new calling code to a smelly API, fix the API first.<p>The problem is just to actually make the developers take the time they need when making estimates. The time it takes to analyze existing code, investigate test coverage, write new tests, refactor old code and THEN implement new code, (and then probably do more refactoring and add further tests) is underestimated. You know what happens. The feature (barely) gets implemented, but there are some loose ends, substandard testing etc. Again: it&#x27;s the developers responsibility to make these estimates big enough. Next time you estimate a trivial thing: list the subtasks in your head and sum the hours (read old code 1h, refactor old code 1h, fix old tests 1h, fix old technical debt 2h, write new tests 1h, implement new feature 2h, ...). Those 2h you initially thought it would take now doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot! If your peers disagree with your 10h estimate for the trivial feature, mention the tasks to them and make them estimate+sum themselves.<p>The development speed will initially go down, in terms of new features added. Managers will be sweating and deadlines will slip. Don&#x27;t worry, if you have a smelly codebase that slowdown would happen later otherwise. It&#x27;s (normally but not always) better to keep the code clean and miss an <i>early</i> deadline (or even cancel the project) rather than miss a <i>late</i> deadline, when there is a lot invested already. This is still a management decision. Tech debt is called tech debt because that what it is. But not all debt is bad. Sometimes you have to take a loan and repay it (150%...) later. It&#x27;s no good to ship a game with nice code if you miss your christmas deadline. Better to make it work with smelly code, and patch it 3 weeks later. That&#x27;s just a reality (anyone who has bought the 1.0.0 of a recent game knows this). If your manager says to cut corners, cut corners, but <i>do</i> write the technical debt fixing story, or add it as a task to another story. Don&#x27;t write // TODO: Fix this in the code and then forget about it. Make the project owner know that saving 8h today will cost them 16h in a month. Do not accept a continuously decreasing code quality. Quality can be a sawtooth pattern where you sometimes rush and then clean up (just a business reality), it just can&#x27;t be a continuous slope. If your managers don&#x27;t accept this reasoning you know what to do.<p>> How do you incorporate it? Create technical debt &quot;user stories&quot; or as part of other user stories?<p>Both. For larger refactoring efforts, it may be worth having separate stories (which later stories depend on). Essentially, if a refactoring task is large enough to warrant it&#x27;s own testing/QA/reviews etc. it&#x27;s a good idea to promote the refactoring task to its own story (The user of some hideous subsystem is you, the developer. &quot;As a developer I&#x27;d like it if subsystem X returned error codes when it fails...&quot;.).",1438119862

My parents moved to Cornwall when I was child, surrounded on 3 sides by water, I gained my surf lifesaving certificate, I was a good swimmer.<p>Almost two decades passes.  I&#x27;m in Bali, on a deserted beach with my ex because we &quot;don&#x27;t want the average experience&quot; or whatever.  A small argument and I decide I want a swim.  I walk out through the surf, my mind overcome with thoughts of the pathetic argument. I don&#x27;t think about the undulating sand beneath my feet, but I should.  Not even 2 minutes into my swim and I&#x27;m out a good 200m.  I&#x27;ve swam 10km before in the sea, I&#x27;m fit enough, but I had been in a bicycle accident and fractured my dominant arm just 8 weeks prior.  My natural confidence, my training, my accolades had resulted in my taking an unknown sea for granted.  I looked to the sure, my girlfriend had vanished, no doubt going to lick her wounds from our previous verbal exchange.<p>I can honestly say the human mind is a strange thing under pressure.  I thought back to being 12 and outright laughing at the tourists (emits, slang for ants in Cornish) who died every year often through a mix of alcohol and poor planning.  The realisation of such past hubris was overwhelming.  I also realised that the people I knew from there would be laughing at my death.  I was now well over 1km from shore.  My mind kicked in properly, I started swimming hard normal to the rip tide.  After 5 minutes of treading water and thinking hard some rocks where looking achievable, so I decided to give it all in the hope of getting there, a fast sprint was my plan and thankfully this worked.<p>If ever I thought I&#x27;d given 100% to a physical activity before I was mistaken.  My legs bore the brunt of this assault, my upper-body was uncoordinated due to the cycling injury.  My watch was telling me I had been hard going for barely 10 minutes.  I was not even half the way, my fear I think allowed for adrenaline to kick in, I was at this point making peace with death of drowning, as an asthmatic a death that has always scared me.<p>I made it to the rocks and to my joy I didn&#x27;t need to climb along them, the rip tide was no more.  I made it to shore.  A half hour swim that had been like no other I&#x27;ve ever had and I hope will ever have.  I was so upset with my ex for leaving me.  Not watching nor caring as I had asked and she agreed.  Going into the unknown water without someone aware is folly and I thought she would be observing me.  Anger and most likely just bordem resulted in her not doing so.<p>TLDR:  I was a good swimmer, I still so very nearly killed myself.

The claims are always the same: faster than flash, denser than dram, lower power than both.<p>Here&#x27;s how to spot BS: first, the density claims are immaterial until they prove yield at a technology node same as dram&#x27;s today. There are multiple billions investment between 180nm and high yield (and low mask count) 2xnm, no matter how cool is the new memory technology.<p>Second, speed claims must be explicitly about latency: flash bandwidth is as large as you want it, latency is ~100us (read). Even so, the moment anybody claims that latency is faster than Dram, you know they&#x27;re feeding the hype and lying to you: dram latency does not depend on the memory technology, rather it depends on the array size. So an 8Gb chip of any memory technology that is fast enough, is likely to be just as fast as dram.<p>Third: power consumption. Dram&#x27;s active power is as low as it gets, the memory cell in particular stores information with really little energy.

Of course, that&#x27;s not as simple as it sounds to implement, but you get an idea what the app does.  It also calls a console app which may alarm your AV software.<p>I hope interested parties will share with me what happens when they try to download the archive file.

They can often call for help, and will do so, interspersed with periods of rest. (Shouting takes a lot of energy.) If the water is warm, they might have hours to get rescued.

But if she is writing a paper on those results, she might want a way to reproduce her findings years down the road (even after she switched Distros), or to collaborate with others who want to reproduce/build on her research (and may not be running her distro).<p>It&#x27;s easy to think &quot;oh, this script just requires python 2.7&quot;, but most of the time you actually have many more dependencies than that (libxml, graphviz, latex, eggs, etc.) A Dockerfile requires some work to setup, but it tracks your requirements in an automated way.<p>So I&#x27;m not going to say &quot;all researchers should use Docker&quot;. But I will say &quot;Docker could be useful to some researchers&quot;.  Just like Source Control, it&#x27;s a tool that solves real problems. Source Control has gotten easy enough to use that it&#x27;s recommended everywhere. Docker (or some other container standard) will get there eventually.",1438117476

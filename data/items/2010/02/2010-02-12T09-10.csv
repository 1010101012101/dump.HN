I used to advocate learning C as a precursor to C++, but that changed as soon as I took a C++ course: C and C++ code look completely different.<p>Before then, my justification was that C presented a cleaner environment than C++ to some of the core concepts, like pointers not being cluttered by having to know about references or the `new` operator. But things like that pale in comparison to the overall style of program design between the languages, which I think is far more important.",1265968762
1120186,comment,1118991,1119071,0,0,NickPollard,,,"I work for a major worldwide game developer, and our project currently uses Lua for a lot of dynamic scripting and behaviour control (the rest of the game is in C++). I've been pushing for a higher usage of it, as it allows a lot more runtime iterating than with C++, where the compile+link+load times on a project this large are killer, whilst Lua can easily be hot reloaded.<p>Of course, the same goes for any scripting language (I've worked with a proprietary script language at my last dev shop), but I like the fact that lua is light, minimalist, clear and a standard that others will know, but also very extensible. I'd definitely say the the small core and lack of huge external libraries is a good thing, when you're developing for fixed hardware like game consoles.",1265968716

Of course it's pretty well recognized that all of that is not a sustainable model and will need to work differently.<p>I'm not recommending that we re-establish the farms that your great-grandfather worked on. There are higher-tech ways to produce. (Hydroponic greenhouse vegetable producers are a good example - they require more labor than planting fields with a tractor, but it's not the back-breaking labor of manually tending fields.)<p>As for the financial prospects - if more people need food and less of it is available, prices will rise. From what I understand, this has played out in Cuba...people who grow and sell food outside the planned economy live quite well.<p>The make-work bias is really only applicable if we're holding up two equivalent systems and I'm arguing for the more labor-intensive one because it is more labor-intensive. I guess mentioning the extra labor was kind of superflous because what I was proposing is that high-yield microfarming might play a roll in feeding more people in the future.

The issue of DMCA take down notices and Google's blind obliging has been a problem for a long time. It has affected many bloggers that do play by the rules. It sucks that Google gets to be the judge and jury in these cases, because really, I doubt anyone at Google cares about who is in the right; they just want to avoid hassles over Copyright.<p>These and all music bloggers know what they are getting into when they set up their blogs. It is no secret that music piracy is a major issue for the RIAA, and posting mp3s publicly definitely puts you at risk. While there are many bloggers that work hard to promote the music they love, and provide links for users to buy the music legitimately, there are many others that just want to attract traffic by giving away free shit. All of the music bloggers are often put in the same pile either way.<p>The music bloggers who were affected by these take downs may be playing the poor me game, but did have the power to prevent what happened by self-hosting their blogs, enabling them to truly own and protect their content.

That is if you're in it for the olde 10-year Norvig cycle.<p>Time allowing, bottom-up programming (as the equally venerable On Lisp details) also applies to design patterns, template meta-programming and all that. It's good to read about them, to learn what others have experimented with and found to be useful (or so they think). But you're only really going to learn them in the context of something useful and practical. It's much better to discover them for yourself in practice.<p>That said, there's a lot of C++ syntax and STL idioms that are not obvious at all -- which make Meyers' books very important (particularly the first one) even for starting out.<p>Also, C++ as doctrine is not fun -- i.e., a way of 'thinking' about programming. But C++ as a collection of language-changing extensions to C is not so terrible. I guess that's true for anything.<p>Actually, now that I think about it. There's Lisp and C -- elegant, simple languages on top of assembly and the lambda calculus if you wish or FP if that's what you emphasize (i.e., math). These are in fairly close approximation to code (assembly) that is in fairly close approximation to how hardware or math works. These provide structure on top of that.<p>And the rest, whether OO in Java and C++ and its rough attempt to merge type theory with performance-consciousness of the actor model from Simula and Smalltalk and Objective-C and all that -- the rest are just organizing paradigms on top.<p>It's late. I've been coding all night. I forget what the question is. There's like 10 dimensions in play when you learn a new language.

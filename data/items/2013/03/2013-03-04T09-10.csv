5317522,comment,5317078,5317414,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"Please don't put words in my mouth. Tax competition that doesn't bring any significant benefits to your economy is not a good thing, because you're giving away something for nothing. I included this qualifier in my original post. Why have the government not arrranged it to the country's advantage? Because a) the government that put these rules in place was not that competent, b) it overestimated the amount of job creation that would result from offering such schemes and c) since Ireland is a small country with a relatively small economy it doesn't have that much negotiating clout. If they pulled the plug on the arrangement tomorrow many f those multinationals would just move their headquarters to Luxembourg or Lichtenstein or whoever else was willing to to offer them a favorable tax regime.<p>As for the Telegraph article, it doesn't really bear out your point, but rather echoes mine: ""Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and a host of household names have regional headquarters in Dublin, whether drawn by a corporation tax of 12.5pc or by the critical mass of a high-tech skills. How much value is added to the Irish economy is an open question."" Those regional headquarters do not involve huge numbers of jobs, any more than the large number of US companies registered in Delaware make that state a hotbed of industrial and commercial activity.",1362391167

(subscribbly.com) to help creators set up subscription programs.<p>I'm interested in opening up beta access to these with interesting ideas for subscription programs they'd like to run. This can involve subscriptions to digital or physical content, and at any scale. As a couple of examples, you could use Subscribbly to run a ""t-shirt club"" that sends a new tee to subscribers every quarter, or an ""designer's toolbox club"" that sends digital design assets (original fonts or icons etc) to members every month. The possibilities are almost endless, and I'm interested in getting a handle on how people would like to use this kind of platform.<p>(The URL again, just in case you skimmed, is subscribbly.com)",1362391116

I'd also rework the skills section to line up with the experience section.<p>The best advice I can give to you is to seek out some digital agencies and to send their Managing Directors or Creative Directors a quick email to run through who you are and whether they would be able to take you on board for a few projects. It's hard to get into some companies, but agencies tend t eat this kind of stuff up and they'd love to be able to give a young developer a chance to work on a real-world client.

5317452,comment,5316992,5316992,6,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"So there are two parts to this question: why do you end up with non-technical directors of IT and why do you end up with idiots who raise obviously dumb helpdesk calls.<p>The later one is a fair question and I can't answer it in any useful way beyond the fact that organisations are often structured to allow and indeed reward things which might otherwise be seen as odd.<p>As to the former, a few reasons spring to mind:<p>1) Because it's hard remaining technical once you reach a certain level. Sure, you can be the best sysadmin or developer in the company, but when you move up the ladder you will spend more and more time doing non-technical things. As that happens you'll pretty rapidly find that others will surpass you technically - entirely reasonable as they're doing stuff five days a week, you're not. If you're managing a big department then the amount of time you're hands on will rapidly drop to zero and given the pace of technology within three years or so you're probably better assuming you know nothing as what you do know is as likely to be wrong as it is right.<p>2) Because they should have decent people they can trust to know and do that stuff. People complain that technical people aren't trusted but having a technical manager as often as not results in meddling and second guessing. A decent IT manager should understand high level principals, be able to ask the right questions and help structure thinking and other than that should let their staff do what he pays them to do. As to why they employ consultants to do things their existing staff can do - a lot of the time this seems to be the case but in 20 years I actually can't think of a single place I've worked where this has been true. Sometimes there's a lack of resource (that is people are busy elsewhere), sometimes specialist knowledge is needed or whatever. In my experience people are usually either neutral or positive about consultants coming in.<p>3) Consider that troubleshooting a VPN isn't the best use of their time. Possibly they could sort out their own VPN connection but if they're earning a six figure salary is it best that they spend half a day sorting it out themselves or that they call in someone who can sort it out in 30 minutes?<p>The short version: a director of IT isn't some sort of senior, senior sysadmin. It's a different job that needs different skills. Yep having technical understanding would be nice but given the choice between a director of IT who could configure a firewall and one who could manage budgets and keep political crap off my desk I know which one I'd take everytime.",1362389620

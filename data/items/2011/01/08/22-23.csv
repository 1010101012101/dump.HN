As long the steps between ""Assume P is true"" and ""therefore FALSE"" are valid, you have a valid proof that ""P is false"".<p>The issue with proofs by contradiction is psychological, but it's important not to ignore such things when you are doing math.  Proofs are written for people to read, and people make mistakes in reading, writing and constructing proofs.  The longer and more complex a proof is, the more likely it is that there are mistakes.  I can't speak for all fields, but in my field (statistics) proofs by contradiction are acceptable but not in style and constructive proofs are generally considered to be more informative.",1294527256

Our observation has only forced us to reject the consolidated theory Newton+6-planets, it doesn't tell us which of the 2 to spare.

I contribute code to GPL-licensed projects, and I don't want the users of my code to be unable to fix it; it's simply not fair to distribute software that the end-users are not allowed to tweak and improve.

Hence, a license that prohibits this unfairness is necessary, and the GPL fits the bill.<p>Don't get me wrong, I am fine with software that is BSD- or MIT- licensed.

2084137,comment,2083672,2083672,0,0,stevenbedrick,,,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. In my experience, the problems that students have ultimately fall into one of two categories:<p>1. Learning to think algorithmically;\n2. Abstraction.<p>What do I mean by these? By ""thinking algorithmically,"" I really mean ""taking a large problem and breaking it up into an ordered series of steps or sub-problems."" This is surprisingly hard for a lot of people, in part because the correct ""size"" of steps or sub-problem can change from problem to problem and from language to language. This can absolutely be taught, though. Some students have an easier time of this than others, but eventually (in my experience) they all get there in the end, and develop an intuitive sense of how to do it... at which point 99% of people immediately ""forget"" what it was like to <i>not</i> be able to do it, and become incapable of recognizing and dealing with students who haven't gotten there yet. :-) Most programmers (myself included, at least until my dozenth or so student, at which point I figured out what was going on) fall into this category: thinking in this manner is so deeply imprinted into our cognitive processes that we typically have a very difficult time visualizing what it's like to not be there. We're sort of like fish and water, if you know what I mean.<p>The second problem is much more difficult to address. Abstraction is one of those things that, I'm convinced, some (most) people can ""get"" and others simply can't. For example, I've had students who seemed to understand arrays perfectly, including the idea of using an integer subscript to refer to the value at an array index such that if you showed them the following code:<p><pre><p>myList = ['monkeys', 'elephants', 'giraffes']\nprint myList[1]<p></pre><p>they'd easily tell you that it would print 'elephants' (yes, they can usually get their heads around zero-indexing without issues). If, however, you showed them this code:<p><pre><p>myList = ['monkeys', 'elephants', 'giraffes']\nidx = 1\nprint myList[idx]<p></pre><p>a lot of them would be more than a little bit lost. Even worse would be if you showed them this code:<p><pre><p>for i in [0, 1, 2]\n	print myList[i]<p></pre><p>They'd be <i>really</i> lost, then. Even if you walk through it line by line, with lots of extraneous print statements, there is a certain sub-type of (otherwise perfectly capable) student that just isn't gonna get it. I'm convinced that this problem--- lack of abstraction ability--- is also why so many students have problems with loops. Dealing with loop counter variables (and the things that you usually want to do with them--- array indexing, printing, doing math, etc.) is very hard if your brain isn't able to think in this abstract manner.<p>It's worse in Java than it is in Python, just 'cause there's so much more code involved (meaning that it's harder to pinpoint exactly where the confusion is coming from), but the problem totally persists even in sane teaching languages. I've talked to a lot of other CS educators who've noticed the same thing- no matter how you approach it, this level of abstraction is just beyond some students' reach. It gets worse once you try and teach them about object/class distinctions, and so on. It's not that they're stupid- my students are usually MDs working on their masters' degrees. It's just that some people's brains don't work that way. And it's not that they can't do other computer stuff- some of these students have gone on to become pretty good at SQL and even relational data modeling, which you'd think would use some of the same cognitive patterns, but apparently is different enough that it's doable.<p>I don't know if the problem would be better or worse teaching with a purely functional language; my gut says ""worse,"" but I haven't tried it so I don't know, and the fact that many students with this problem go on to handle declarative languages pretty well gives me pause.",1294525684

If you reach a contradiction, you have to question whether or not you got there suspiciously easily.<p>If you're aiming for something more specific than just falsehood -- ""not X"", say, as in the contrapositive approach -- you might be less likely to get there incorrectly. If you reach a contradiction along the way, you don't go on to say ""and I'm done since contradiction implies everything including not-P"", (even though technically speaking this would be perfectly valid) instead you question where you went wrong in the proof, because this is too easy.<p>But yes this certainly feels like more of a fuzzy psychological argument doesn't it.

Let's say you're logging into soawesome.com as a User of soawesome.com.  That makes soawesome.com the ""Customer"", and you the User.  Just to setup some terms.  Also, let's say I'm not picking on OpenID but really any of the ""redirect based"" auth methods that transfer ownership of users to a 3rd party.<p>The difference in design is that OpenID assumes that the Customer is less trustworthy than the OpenID Provider+User.  They've done a good job marketing this idea that you can't trust sites and so you, the User, should use OpenID.  If you think about that it's kind of idiotic to assume that you're going to log into an untrusted site using another site (which could also be untrusted).  It also assumes that most web users are savvy enough to know what this is, but if you were up on the ReadWriteWeb/Facebook fiasco you know most users can't tell their ass from a hole in the ground.  OpenID is just confusing to them.<p>The truth is, if I can phish and XSS one site I can do it to another site.  If someone can hack soawesome.com, they can hack your OpenID provider of choice too.  All the attacks you have against one auth system apply to all auth systems because security in the browser is fairly broken.  It's really completely a usability problem, and no amount of redirecting and bouncing around with crypto is going to solve that.<p>However, this mistrust of the Customer means that there's a huge risk for the Customer against the Provider.  At any moment the Provider can decide they hate the Customer and turn off all the users.  This actually happens often enough that it worries people to the point they put links to about 10 OpenId sites.<p>I'm trying to offer a solution that assumes the Customer is trusted and should own their Users, but that gives them a simple enough setup process that it competes with OpenID for simplicity of configuration (which isn't hard because OpenID is a pain in the ass).  It should also give the Customer plausible deniability on password storage so, in the event of a breach, they don't lose anything.  I'm also focusing on making this mobile/desktop device friendly, something that OpenID and OAuth totally fail at.<p>This Customer v. User contention is the most likely the point of contention you have in your comment:  you believe you own your user account, but customers believe they own it.  I'm actually not sure what's the answer, but autho.me is kind of an experiment in doing it the other way.",1294524958

And they use it for other stuff too, from graphics code to MacRuby.<p>3) ""since then, Apple's Xcode compiler has rapidly slipped out of date, and now they are forced to take over development of a BSD project just to stay competitive"".<p>Actually Apple had made huge improvements to XCode's compiler in XCode 3, even adding several new features to the core Objective-C language, and also made a HUGE improvement to the overall IDE and compiler (new static analyzer, new debugger, AST-based syntax assistance and code completion etc) with XCode 4 (currently in public beta 5).<p>4) despite Apple's claims, Clang/LLVM is still very very far behind GCC in terms of correctness and compliance<p>Bzzz, wrong.<p>5) (certainly with recent specifications, like C++0x)<p>Which are not even standard yet, and noone cares about while actually SHIPPING code.<p>Whatever man...",1294524231

E.g. A timing attack based on password length in SRP is legit.  Everything you bring up is just yelling and screaming about browser security issues every login system has, then claiming your proposed login solution doesn't have them.<p>Even in this comment you're all over the map.  HMAC?  I'm not using HMAC. RSA vs. SRP?  One is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm and the other is a authentication protocol, which are very different. You can't just slap RSA on something and then it's an auth algorithm.  There's a whole range of protocol analysis to do in addition to just using RSA.<p>But why am I telling you that?  You're a real cryptographer.  How come you didn't mention the possible timing attack against SRP?",1294524024

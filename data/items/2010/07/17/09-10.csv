1523565,comment,1520552,1522540,0,0,whimsy,,,"This is true for O(n) but not for o(n).\nf(n) is the class of O(g(n)) of g(n) if g(n) dominates f(n) for sufficiently large n. o(g(n)) strictly dominates f(n), though, no matter how small n is.<p>Big O notation, or Landau notation, is not just O(g(n)). It's also o(), Ω(), ω() and Θ(). It's understood, though, that n is considered to usually be rather large - another name for this notation is, after all, ""asymptotic notation."" In any case that you're really worried about speed, you should probably be calculating the speed of your algorithm directly rather than using mere asymptotic generalizations.<p>Aside: I can't think of any algorithms with huge constants like you described; in theory, you're correct, but in practice, the asymptotic generalizations apply for n <= 1000 or even often 100.",1279360011

1523562,comment,1523525,1523525,0,0,bluesmoon,,,"I balance it more or less equally.  Lunch is generally at the office cafeteria, so I won't count that.  Weekend lunches are kitchen experiments, so think of it as lab work and don't count it either.<p>Breakfast is typically cereal, or toast and marmalade, but on weekends I might do scrambled eggs, or pancakes and if my girlfriend's around, we might do something like <a href=""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poha_%28rice%29>Poha</a&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poha_%28rice%29>Poha</a...</a>; or <a href=""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upma>Upma</a&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upma>Upma</a&#62</a>; or something else fancy, but it's always at home.<p>Dinner is where the trade-off happens.  I'll cook at home one or two days and eat out three days.  So what happens with the remaining two days of the week?  Leftovers from the two days that I do cook.<p>When I eat out, I end up spending not less than $10 on a meal.  If I cook at home, I spend maybe $10 for two and a half meals.  Why the difference?  From what I can tell, there are several reasons...<p>At home, I cook once and cover several meals.  I have no wastage because I refrigerate leftovers and eat them the next day.  I decide what I'm gonna cook before I buy the ingredients.  Each dish a restaurant makes has to serve one person.  They buy the ingredients in advance and hope to break even on what they use.  More often than not, then end up with wastage that they must throw away.  This is factored into the menu.<p>The restaurant also needs to pay rent for their premises, pay salaries and follow health guidelines.  You could factor your house rent into your meals, in which case it should shoot each day's meal up by $30 or more.  You could also choose to pay yourself whenever you cook, pushing it up another few dollars, and as far as the health code goes... you decide.",1279359726

I'm not sure whether this is true or not, but I see a lot of people getting excited during product creation and launch and the whole energy and excitement kinda goes away with time. You gotta endure on the slow days, too.<p>Although I hate to give pessimistic advice, check this link: <a href=""http://goo.gl/MF7D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/MF7D</a> - Rob Walling talks about that your focus shouldn't be to get rich on your first product, but to learn as much as you can.<p>Good luck!",1279359206

What PagerDuty does is let you control who, how, and when people are notified when problems occur.  In contrast, monitoring tools like Pingdom and Nagios focus more on detecting problems.  While they have some native alerting functionality, we think with PagerDuty's advanced alerting, they can function all the better.",1279359112

Which can be quite hard when the hold music is regularly interrupted with voice announcements. Yes I realise my call is important to you, but if you didn&#x27;t tell me that every 10 seconds I could stop listening so hard and (maybe?) enjoy the music.<p>As an aside, their comparison of voluntary queuing with and without virtual queues is suspect as they seem to inform the customer about the length of the queue only when they also have the callback system.

857146,comment,856242,856993,0,0,elblanco,,,"I wish I could agree more with more upvotes. One of the most important factors IMHO when hiring people is their personality and ability to work with the team. A battery of quiz, psych and trivia questions does little to reveal anything related to that other than what a person's stress tolerances are.<p>I usually just interview as a conversation. Likely I'm going to have to be able to talk to this person regularly anyways. Once that happens, they relax and I've found that their background claims tend to be far more realistic, more willing to point out their faults, and yet still have plenty of ability to discuss deep technical questions as well. But now it's not 20 questions it's ""can you whiteboard the architecture of that project your were mentioning a few minutes ago?"" And then use that as a point of discussion, e.g. ""well why did you do it this way vs. this way?"" They should be able to provide a reasonable answer.<p>Really what most employers want is somebody who's able to think deeply, justify their own thought process, demonstrate the ability to research and general technical acumen. Most likely their technical history won't be a 1:1 match for what your company does anyway, so they'll simply have to learn a number of new languages or development metaphors, use cases, architectures etc.",1254495550

The closest example I can think of is the Robot Auto-Racing Simulation (RARS) league.<p>A buddy of mine and I were working on this briefly, back in '94, but it went the way of many side-projects. Maybe it's time to resurrect the idea?<p>The competition could offer multiple challenge classes. E.g:<p>1) complete a given scenario with fixed win and loss conditions. (with some unknowns / variance as to opposing force)\n2) compete against other AIs in a tournament\n3) compete against humans in a tournament\n...\n4) compete in a game whose rules are provided in machine-readable format just before the competition begins<p>In case (1), it would be good to run the scenario multiple times (with, and without memory?) to get some idea of the AI's variance.<p>One thing I'd like to see is a domain-specific language that could describe the rules for many popular RTS's. This would allow research into more general RTS-playing AI that could compete well in whole class of games, rather than being custom-tailored to each game.<p>Thoughts?",1254495268

Imagine a realtime Reddit with living, breathing comment threads.  Even the StackOverflow model becomes something new with this.<p>Even more basic than that is how this, I believe, will replace email for even casual users.  I'm sure the rest of you have similar experiences where you get involved in long email threads with friends, and how that can slow down, say, planning something to do that night, or planning a trip or some kind of thing that requires consensus and a bit of discussion.  The flow of reply-all, wait, reply-all goes away completely.<p>And, of course, the collaboration aspects of it are pretty awesome.<p>So I wasn't convinced until last night, and now I'm nearly as excited as when I first saw the graphical web with Mosaic or sent my first email with a NeXT box in college or dialed up my first BBS.<p>There is quite a bit of promise here.",1254494773

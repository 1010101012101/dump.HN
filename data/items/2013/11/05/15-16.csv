If we&#x27;re naming syntactic structures, then we want to divide sentences according to their syntax.<p>So, in Latin (and other languages, but I know Latin), there&#x27;s a verb form called future tense:<p>laudo -> present 1sg active indicative, &quot;I praise&quot;<p>laudabo -> future 1sg active indicative, &quot;I will praise&quot;<p>English has nothing analogous. To achieve the same semantics (referring to the future), you need some combination of explicit time reference and periphrasis (&quot;I will praise him tomorrow&quot;). So we usually say that English has two tenses, which you might refer to as present and preterite, or past and non-past, or A and B, or any combination thereof (though I don&#x27;t recommend &quot;preterite and B&quot;). Referring to a &quot;future tense&quot; in English is buying into the idea that every structure in every language has not only a conventional way of being expressed in every other language, but an analogous structure there as well.<p>On a totally unrelated note, the 1sg Latin subjunctive forms of esse [to be] are sim (present), essem (imperfect), fuerim perfect), and fuissem (pluperfect). The Italian form &quot;fossi&quot; appears closely related to fuissem, so I&#x27;m a little surprised to see that it&#x27;s called &quot;imperfect&quot;. How many tenses of subjunctive does Italian have? Are there obvious analogs to any of the other three Latin forms?",1383667000

The simple facts are damning enough without layers of editorializing cruft from an unreliable source.<p>For example, consider the assertion that people need to go to jail for fraud in the HSBC case. Most of these bad things are instances of the bank systemically not monitoring transactions closely enough. You can&#x27;t pick individuals and throw them in jail for responding to bad institutional incentives--you have to pick out a specific criminal act that&#x27;s punishable by jail time and pin it on someone, beyond reasonable doubt. Truth be told, if you start doing this in an <i>equitable</i> fashion with the goal of &quot;punishing&quot; bad banking behavior, you&#x27;ll target a lot of lower-middle-class mortgage brokers from the 2008 mortgage crisis who knowingly committed fraud, which seems like an undesirable result. Or maybe you could pick a few politically convenient scapegoats, but that would be unjust in a different way. That&#x27;s why we fine banks billions of dollars instead.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5616805"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5616805</a>",1383666978

They just rewrote about 50% of the source code.<p>Nah, not a lot.<p>And they&#x27;re doing it EXACTLY so they can make a mod store.<p>Now, the only reason you cannot pay for Railcraft is because Mojang included a clause stating that you cannot sell modifications or derivative works based on Minecraft&#x27;s source code. They ARE working on a mod store and API... since 2011. I believe it will be coming in the next year or so, Mojang claims January but I stopped believing them long ago.<p>About modifications, I started work on a way to improve mod distribution from servers to clients: AsieLauncher. It automatically generates a launcher, a list of modifications and a list of changes between modpacks. It supports delta updating, all MC versions from 1.2.3 to 1.7.2, optional mods and a lot of other things.<p>The plan was to add support for automatic mod updating and dependency tracking, but the problem is mod authors aren&#x27;t often willing to participate, due to stubbornness or just plain assholery or laziness. That&#x27;s why such projects rarely take off.",1383666924

No Korean financial institution will let you log into their interfaces on anything other than IE. Often the homepage would be completely broken in anything other than IE anyway. This is true for most sites, though those were easily avoidable. Banks and the like, not so much.<p>To perform financial transactions online in Korea, you would need a plethora of software (often one from each party you would deal with) that revolved around security certificates that were issued by the banks that would store a hard copy of the certificate locally on your computer. Often it didn&#x27;t work at all, not even getting into the security implications of the system. Bank hacking is so common in Korea, it&#x27;s really disturbing. There is absolutely no accountability where the attempts at security do exist.<p>Also, you need to use your Citizen Number (basically a Social Security Number) to register for ANY service in Korea, even common websites. So everything you do can be traced via that single number. For foreigners, registering for common sites is usually impossible because our alien numbers are stored wherever normal citizen numbers are, so unless the site has a separate process for foreigners, you&#x27;d be out of luck. It&#x27;s quite a mess. I can&#x27;t say enough bad things.<p>On the bright side, start ups like Vingle in Seoul are doing a lot of tip the scales for the younger generation by only supporting modern browser versions (IE8+, not the most modern, but definitely a step up from IE6, which has a huge market share still, too), but it&#x27;s a slow change.",1383666514

Not so much can they make a twitter app or a 2-d platformer or something equally unrelated.  I don&#x27;t want a blocky minecraft looking pacman clone, at all.<p>I&#x27;d pay more for the RailCraft mod than I paid for minecraft itself, in terms of enjoyment per $.  Of course the RC mod is free ...  Also I use buildcraft mod although the gold pipes suck for steam distribution, and I&#x27;d pay for buildcraft, although thats free.  Thermal expansion has better steam distribution...<p>The great mothership recently released a new minecraft version, which amounted to a couple new flowers and some biomes for people who don&#x27;t mine, and nothing at all for anyone who does anything below the surface.  Its called Minecraft, gentlemen, not fuzzy bunny craft so lose the giant mushroom biome please, and beg borrow or steal the buildcraft, railcraft, forestry, applied energetics, universal electricity, and a couple other mods so people who mine in MINEcraft actually have something fun to do rather than admiring double height grass blocks and mesa biomes.<p>The other thing which is hilarious from a guy who&#x27;s been into computers since 1981 is the mods ecosystem is from a software engineering / systems administration standpoint just a tiny bit more advanced than the msdos era, actually pretty close to my historical digging into MVS/360.  So its 2013 and apt and dpkg and friends have existed since the very early 90s, but in 2013 the way you handle version dependence and bug tracking and distribution is you manually visit adware download spam sites and click 50 times to download a tiny mod, and then track version compatibility manually by visiting 50 decentralized web forums.  Oh and don&#x27;t get me started on people who think a 15 minute youtube video with awful video and music counts as the only form of &quot;documentation&quot; required.  Dudes, its 2013 almost 2014 not the era of msdos 3.11 and warez BBS systems?  It really does suck after using Linux since the early 90s and downshifting back to 1985, even though I run minecraft on linux (both client and server).<p>Mojang should implement a minecraft mod store with a payment system thats trustworthy/reliable and very fast with excellent versioning compatibility.  I&#x27;d pay $40 for railcraft and mojang can keep $10 of it and everyone else will be happy as long as I get $40 of actual service, like its very fast and completely transparent and highly reliable and effective and perhaps dare I ask, effectively and centrally documented and centrally bug tracked?",1383665266

They moved at the same time from IISc. I agree with everything deepGem has to say about ISRO. It is far from the &#x27;third world space program&#x27; that many like to romanticize.<p>Few thoughts:<p>- There is a common myth, one about how Indians used bullock carts to test the antennas on a satellite. This, for example, wasn&#x27;t because they couldn&#x27;t anechoic chambers, but simply because bullock carts have few metallic parts to interfere with the actual measurements.

ISRO has essentially a limitless budget to spend on their projects. My father used to travel first class on international trips to meet suppliers in the 1980s and early 1990s.<p>The reason for low-brow tables and ceiling fans is more to do with cultural aspects. In fact, there are many top universities, and old corporations (based on anecdata) in the US where working conditions are &#x27;ghetto&#x27; by Apple-Google-Facebook standards. The reason simply is that renovating workplace infrastructure is a pretty significant expense.<p>I can also tell you that there are absolutely no problems with technology infrastructure (including internet speeds) in ISRO. Some of their offices were wired for internet as early as early as 1992.<p>The one downside of working at ISRO, as with any government establishment is the bureaucracy that one has to deal with, and the general reverence for seniority (vs. reverence for pure merit, etc.)",1383664316

Subjunctive mood is usually, like indicative and imperative moods, marked on the verb. (In my mind, interrogative is also a mood, but it is usually marked on the sentence, not on the verb.)  Indicative and imperative moods have fairly narrow commonly-agreed semantics, but subjunctive is more of a catchall (my second link above will warn of the danger of confusing syntactic terminology with semantics, but while they don&#x27;t correspond perfectly, they are related).  We can quickly note that &quot;if I were a rich man&quot;, a counterfactual clause, easily fits into area that can be covered by a &quot;subjunctive&quot; mood in various languages.<p>It&#x27;s widely agreed that the following construction in English should be called &quot;subjunctive&quot;:<p>I ask that you <i>be</i> polite to him.<p>The subjunctive form of &quot;be&quot; is so distinct from any other finite form that it makes for good examples.  Any time a finite verb can be realized as &quot;be&quot;, we&#x27;re comfortable calling it subjunctive (&quot;<i>be</i> he alive or <i>be</i> he dead, I&#x27;ll grind his bones to make my bread&quot;).<p>That construction is productive today and nicely applies to any english verb:<p>I&#x27;m going to have to ask that your son <i>return</i> my necklace.<p>The argument against calling &quot;if I <i>were</i> a rich man&quot; subjunctive makes the following points:<p>- It doesn&#x27;t use the subjunctive form.<p>- It is not obviously related to any construction that does use a subjunctive form.<p>- Though it is obviously a special form, it only applies to a single verb, and even there it&#x27;s not required (Zwicky, my second link, talks about this some more).  This can raise questions about how much it&#x27;s a &quot;real phenomenon&quot;, vs how much it&#x27;s basically just an archaism.<p>- In the past, subjunctive forms could appear in English conditionals, but they no longer do.<p>Zwicky will tell you (and this is a point that follows my own inclinations well) that as long as you&#x27;ve described the rules correctly, the names that you give <i>to</i> the rules (&quot;subjunctive&quot;) are irrelevant.  So in that sense, you can call any form you want &quot;subjunctive&quot;, as long as you&#x27;re willing to extend the description to every instance of an analogous form, which is easy with &quot;if I <i>were</i> a rich man&quot;, as it is the only form of its kind.<p>- However, as the generally-agreed subjunctive is a living and useful phenomenon, and is unrelated to the were-form, it might be nice to give the were-form a name that won&#x27;t confuse people.",1383663873

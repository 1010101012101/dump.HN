I wouldn&#x27;t have to do it on a regular base. :)<p>AROS is a bit odd, as they are trying to build a full-blown OS although most of the people are probably running it in the hosted version on Linux.<p>IMO using one of the free unixoid OS as foundation with AROS on top would make more sense. I&#x27;m sad that Amithlon didn&#x27;t work out.<p>Using classic Amiga as main computers is a hardcore task. I can see that it is not impossible to achieve with PPC Amigas and MorphOS or OS4.

I also know that they ran speedily on rubbish hardware.<p>After ditching my BBC B (I was poor), I remember using Win 3.1 on a 386SX with 4MB RAM that someone had thrown out and installing software to take over program manager and make it look like Win95 because my machine wasn&#x27;t powerful enough to run Windows 95... How a second-hand 486DX was a revelation. 16MB of RAM! Unfathomable! What could use so MUCH RAM????<p>I also remember faffing with config.sys etc. to unload mouse drivers so I could run games that moaned about himem.sys in DOS. And telling every game that I really did have an Adlib sound card and a SoundBlaster 16. I really didn&#x27;t. It was a £7.50 soundcard I bought from a boy at school (who now works at Amazon and has software patents, well done to him! He was really clever, wrote games, played piano like a pro too. Nice guy).<p>Then the upgrades to Win95, 98 (oooh Web desktop!), installing RedHat 5.2 (no, not RHEL 5.2), reading PC Plus and any magazine that mentioned Linux in an effort to learn more (dialup was expensive), and to make my abysmal VESA graphics card run X, then running FVWM, KDE1 (looked like CDE, how reassuring), GNOME1 (it&#x27;s squishy), KDE2, 3.5 (perfection, everything was configurable) then going back to GNOME2 (it was simple), then abandoning it all after GNOME3 and KDE4 (hmmm a cashew) and going to OSX.

10470093,comment,10463464,10468116,0,0,pron,,,"You won&#x27;t find much argument from me here, but I think I need to clarify my point. I&#x27;m not saying that blue-collar is &quot;better&quot; or even has better chances for adoption[1] (though I believe it does), but that when you decide to go non-blue-collar, how exactly do you do that? For example, you mention &quot;deemphasising  consistency or underlying coherence&quot; as a bad thing. But <i>how</i> bad is it? We <i>know</i> memory safety is important. Do we <i>know</i> sound type systems are important to the same extent? My important meta-point was that when designing a new language <i>for the industry</i>, you should at least do so to solve a problem that you believe (preferably with empirical evidence) causes real pain in the real world. That&#x27;s how Java, Erlang, Clojure, Rust and even Kotlin were designed (Kotlin is different because it&#x27;s decided to solve a less-painful problem but for much less cost, but the same thinking is there). Are crude type systems a real problem? I don&#x27;t know, but I certainly have never seen any evidence to suggest that is the case. So if you set out on this path, at least conduct a survey or research (or even your own rich experience) to convince yourself that your solving a major problem. Why? Because unlike many other tools, new languages are <i>very</i> expensive to adopt. The higher the cost -- the bigger the benefit you must provide.<p>Having said that, as you correctly note there are other paths to adoption, such as being the only language on a popular platform (JavaScript, Objective-C, Swift), or being a scripting language. Those seem to have their own rules.<p>[1] Although Java wasn&#x27;t more marketed than other heavily-marketed alternatives at the time, and Python and JavaScript both have their own peculiar adoption stories, with JavaScript still trying to look similar to its &quot;sister-language&quot; Java, and then being the only choice on a popular platform, and Python taking a long time for decent adoption that even today is far from C/Java/C# levels of popularity, and either case being, or at least starting out as scripting languages for small programs -- not as languages for &quot;serious&quot; systems.",1446115078

If I resolve a problem in my head, I&#x27;m bored with it. I can tell someone how to do it, see the results, and then check the feedback. I&#x27;m good at this.<p>For my daily job I have a dev team and I&#x27;m responsible for introducing new IT/process solutions in our company. And that&#x27;s basically my dream job - I gather and process information, and give solutions that my team can develop, or that managers in other departments can introduce to their processes.<p>I work with computers (for me IT is about doing all the things that are repetitive, so people can do creative stuff), but mostly I work with people, as I need to know what the teams in the company can do, what do we need changes on system level or what can we leave to people, as solutions are often on the border.<p>I have a lot of projects that I&#x27;ve started, piles of notes I&#x27;ve made since I was ~14, a lot of backups with projects that I started, I developed some kind of pre-MVP versions, just to explore my ideas and see what&#x27;s possible at the time - and when I &quot;solved&quot; it.. it was boring, and I went to other projects. \nLast project made me snap, as I&#x27;ve got the working thing on the web, planned out the refactoring (as it was written in 2 days as a proof of concept and to gather feedback), and I can&#x27;t make the next step..<p>The only idea I have is to have a help of 1-2 developers that are willing to put their time in my project. Project that (mostly) don&#x27;t have a business plan, but they may be fun to do, may create a great community, maybe in future they can have some business value (but this I didn&#x27;t yet figured).<p>Now my 30th is coming, and for couple of months I&#x27;ve been wondering about &quot;how to make this work?&quot;<p>Did any of you out there had similar problems?

10470032,comment,10463464,10467899,0,0,pron,,,"> I agree it&#x27;s a difference, but you really think that makes it worlds apart?<p>Yes. Well, it&#x27;s one of the symptoms. Let me explain, but instead of using my own words, let me quote Ceylon&#x27;s website:<p><i>Ceylon is a new programming language that&#x27;s deeply influenced by Java, designed by people who are unapologetic fans of Java... But much of our frustration is not even with the Java language itself. The extremely outdated class libraries that form the Java SE SDK are riddled with problems. Developing a great SDK is a top priority of the project... Java interoperability is a major priority for the project. However, since Ceylon will be based on its own modular SDK, making a clean break from the legacy Java SDK, Ceylon will require new frameworks designed especially for Ceylon.</i><p>In one of the comments, Gavin King, Ceylon&#x27;s chief designer, explains what differentiates Ceylon from other attempts:<p><i>What&#x27;s going to be very challenging is the _platform_: the libraries and frameworks. This is where most of the potential value of this project resides, but it&#x27;s where we have relatively more work to do than other projects which simply aim to leverage the Java SDK &quot;as is&quot;.</i><p>So (my words now), Ceylon is a new language with a new ecosystem. It is a greenfield project that <i>also can</i> interoperate with &quot;legacy&quot; Java libraries. Kotlin is fundamentally different, as Gavin Kind correctly notes. It&#x27;s decided from the get go that the Java ecosystem <i>is</i> the Kotlin ecosystem. That any Java library is an <i>idiomatic</i> Kotlin library and will be treated the same way as if it were written in Kotlin (that goal has not been achieved 100%, but certainly 95%). That meant that any language feature that would have made the Java ecosystem different from the Kotlin ecosystem was intentionally left out. For Ceylon, the goal was different. A new better language and a new better SDK. When interoperability was concerned, wrapper types were introduced and sometimes language features (that are not recommended for Ceylon code) like use-site variance, too. That is a completely different perspective with major implications. Kotlin really does have many thousands of <i>Koltin</i> libraries; Ceylon doesn&#x27;t. OTOH, Ceylon is a more comprehensively designed <i>language</i> with less compromises.<p>I can speak from experience. I&#x27;m the author of several Java libraries. Some of them have hundreds of API classes and thousands of methods. Making those libraries &quot;Kotlin idiomatic&quot; was zero effort, and adding <i>all</i> the necessary &quot;Kotlin bling&quot; (e.g. cool use of inline functions which are Kotlin&#x27;s poor-man&#x27;s macros) took a couple hundred lines of code, none of which were really necessary. Clojure, BTW, is similar, but less ambitious in that regard. As all Clojure collections are Java collections and vice-versa, Rich Hickey specifically said that Java libraries should not be wrapped, as many can be used as-is, simply passing in and getting out plain Clojure types. Ceylon is different. If I have a library working with Java collections (which is pretty much all of them), any use by Ceylon code would feel foreign and may require wrapping or other special handling. But that is <i>by design</i>. It says so right there on the Ceylon website. How can any of that be FUD?<p>> There. Right there ;)<p>I see. Then consider changing the Ceylon website because it&#x27;s just full of FUD about replacing the ecosystem. I might be guilty of spreading it, but I&#x27;m not the source.",1446113649

However, because there are only a few dozen users like this in a total set of >200.000 users, their actions do not affect the result much.<p>Unfortunately I did not have enough time to do a similar analysis on the Twitter data from Oktober. But I hope that the same conditions apply. In any case, I will take your concerns into account and try to do more analysis on  the set of users from the dataset of September and Oktober if I have some time today or tomorrow.",1446113508

When I see what politicians from my country voted on I&#x27;m realizing that journalists, political science majors, historians, spanish/english/lang language teachers, philosophers, artists and bunch of other social scientists know much about nothing - maybe it says something about our national universities, maybe about these science areas as a whole, who knows. But for some reason they think they are capable of having a career in politics, and it works.",1446113474

Regardless, if you read my statement, it has nothing to do with whether a company/govt should or should not provide insurance, just that &quot;no sane person is against people having health insurance&quot;. If someone thinks, in general, people should not have health care services I think there is something wrong with them i.e. they are not being sane.<p>A better example could have perhaps been rent ceilings in large cities, since there are many classic examples of this loophole behavior in economics.",1446113463

Luckily I belong to the people who run out of energy fast. Therefore I need to stop and break and make a reality check for myself regularly.<p>I recognize myself in the behavior that the writer describes. Going all-in on too many things, and all the negative consequences that result from that.<p>The feeling I felt as I read the article wasn&#x27;t just recognition; it was <i>envy</i>. Because I am actually one of those people who run out of energy fast, my &#x27;all-in&#x27; has not even resulted in a partner, kids, &#x27;prominence&#x27; in any community, etc.<p>Basically, I am in much of the same place as the author, for the same reasons (to the degree that I can tell from one article, of course), except that I have nothing to show for it.<p>The best I can say about that, perhaps, is that by having less to &#x27;show for it&#x27; I also have less to mess up or lose.<p>Small comfort.<p>Discovering that I also belong to the people that run out of energy fast, and that even operating at &#x27;normal speed&#x27; can be disastrous for me in very particular contexts is a good thing though. If I learn to make these &#x27;reality checks&#x27; regularly, I will most certainly be happier and more grounded, and in fact I&#x27;m pretty confident I&#x27;ll even be able to &#x27;achieve things&#x27; in the long run.<p>And that&#x27;s a ray of hope, however small and however far off its source seems. Slow and steady wins the race, I think, applies very much to me.<p>My primary challenge is that I find it really, <i>really</i> difficult to &#x27;make reality checks&#x27;. I have recently been diagnosed with (mild) autism, and apparently this inability is pretty typical.<p>How do you keep yourself from either going too much all-in, or hiding from the world too much, when much of the time you&#x27;re barely aware of whether you&#x27;re doing one or the other? How do you remind yourself to do a reality check when you forget about the reminder, because your brain is stuck on some random obsession?<p>Sometimes I feel that I live in a world that is fundamentally not suited to me. I don&#x27;t think of eating unless someone else starts eating, but because I live alone in a big city with some flatmates I barely know, I am often not triggered. I don&#x27;t think of leaving the house to socialize because there is no clear pattern or cohesive structure to my social world. It&#x27;s all opt-in and based on personal initiative, mostly. I sometimes struggle doing work as a freelance developer, because my brain gets stuck in a loop and I just pace my room talking to myself. Or, the other way around, I work and work at the expense of everything else and end up in a pretty bad place because of this. It made me understand why weekends and vacations are important. If only I could remember this. I&#x27;ve tried for years.<p>I sometimes miss the period in my life where external structures provided me with a socialization pattern (student org.), where deadlines and tests forced me in some kind of rhythm, or, longer ago, where living with my family provided me with the triggers I need to engage in normal, healthy behavior (eat well, sleep regularly, get outside, talk to people, sit with people not talking, emotional &#x27;cleanup&#x27; by talking to parents/siblings, etc).<p>Sorry about this reply getting off track. It sort of got away from me...",1446113332

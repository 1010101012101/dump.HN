All the heat is generated in the middle and takes millennia to reach the top.<p>So anything that basically ""mixes"" the sun will cause more heat to be emitted. No sun spots=no mixing, and all the heat remains trapped.<p>I think that after trapping heat for so long, the sun gets hotter and generates more sun spots because of all the extra energy. The sun spots bleed it out, and the cycle continues.",1218815874

The big issue is ease of use.  If someone could put all of these technologies together, such that a ""channel"" or a ""station"" for video shows on the web was as easy to set up as a website, and easy to connect to for a user, you'd see an explosion of such sites, which happened with web sites and low quality video snippets (YouTube).<p>Web protocols which can support P2P live streaming as well as Bittorrent supports download would be the final ingredient of TV's demise.",1218815343

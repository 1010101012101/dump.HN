You have to have a good model of the underlying system. Otherwise you won't understand why boxed integers are inherently slow. Or why an array of tuples can be much slower than a tuple of arrays.<p>Modern languages completely abstract from fundamental things like indirection. Consequently, it becomes almost impossible to accurately estimate the performance of algorithms in high level programming languages.<p>Waiting for people with experience optimizing prolog programs to disagree with me...",1213829955

Having experiences with it both here and in third world countries, I can tell you that ""empowering"" a police officer to be judge, jury & executioner is just begging for corruption.<p>The system we have in the US is amazing. Certainly some people make it through the system without being punished as severely as they should, but that's the price you pay for having freedom.<p>There is no accountability when there isn't a paper trail; there is no way to appeal a faulty judgement. Just because a cop thinks someone is guilty does not make them guilty.",1213829826

""I'm the President, so I know what to do with schools(NCLB)"" ?<p>Actually, you pretty much hit the nail on the head -- ask any soldier who's been involved boots on the ground in the American battlefronts in the middle east, and I betcha alot of them have a better idea of what's going on than your average news commentator or politician.<p>You may not like the analogy, but this very argument is the thesis of most Pres.

221290,comment,221134,221134,0,0,boredguy8,,,"""simplicity is a guide to truth"" is not a summary of Occam's Razor. It says that _all things being equal_ the simplest explanation is generally the best. If you have an elegant solution that doesn't account for everything, there's a problem[1]. That problem is either in the theory or in the data, but until that problem is resolved, you're not helping advance much of anything.<p>So, for instance, we can still (I am told by credible astrophysicists) posit a geocentric cosmology if we're willing to adapt a rather complex system. But rather than think this is true, we have an alternative hypothesis that accounts for the same data without introducing a plethora of adjustments.<p>But of course, gravity _alone_ doesn't count for the data, hence Einstein.<p>Gravity is a ""simpler"" explanation, but it doesn't _account_ for our observations, so it get axed.<p>Scientists doing philosophy without training is almost always a very scary thing to witness.<p>[1] Re: we don't make curves that fit every data point: those curves are not -predictive- (i.e. you can perfectly account for -known- data, but you blow when you try to predict -future- data) and hence don't provide a reliable account of phenomenon. So they're rejected on that basis.",1213829661

It's the same problem faced by C programmers for the past 30 years, and it hasn't really retarded library development.

Bonus points for living in the inner-city and being familiar with drug trafficking.<p>That would give us a lot more context into why you think what the cops were doing was wrong, and, maybe more importantly, what your solution is to improving the problem (if there is one, which, of course, you know all about).<p>As Prometheus said in the comments below, it's obviously sometimes a wise decision to allow those to have an objective look at a situation -- not those who are looking at the issue from two inches in front of their face -- figure out how the system will operate.<p>I would submit, however, that that model is very reminiscent of the ""Twitter can't scale"" debate, where everybody and their grandmother is offering gratuitous advice on how the team on the ground should scale their project when they don't even know how it's built, with what toolset, and what the core problems are.",1213829362
221286,comment,220973,221230,0,0,timr,,,"I just spent a big chunk of my life getting a PhD, so you don't really need to lecture me on the economics of graduate education.  I'm under no illusions that grad school is anything like professional school.  Also, I <i>know</i> that you're making the argument that grad student research leads to gains in long-term GDP and new industries and blah, blah, blah.  Yes.  I get it.<p>What you're <i>missing</i> -- the important part of my argument -- is that these gains are <i>hypothetical</i> and <i>long-term</i>.  In the <i>short term</i>, we're paying <i>real, present-value dollars</i> for foreign students to get their degrees.  If we then <i>throw them out</i> after they graduate, we are also <i>throwing away</i> the bulk of their productivity.  We train them, then we cast them aside.<p>Your comments about ""indentured servitude"" are a straw man, and I'm not going to address them here.  Also, I don't necessarily support the way that universities use foreign students to conduct research at below-market rates (it's a big part of why I no longer work in the field in which I was trained).  My argument is narrow:  if we're going to pay for these folks to get trained here, it makes no sense to kick them out of the country when they're done.",1213829326

Nobody expects it to turn an immediate profit, or even generate a revenue of any significance -- which is great, because it usually doesn't, and <i>most</i> academic research isn't commercially viable anyway.<p>When we pay for foreign students to earn advanced degrees, only to kick them out of the country once they've graduated, we're cutting off our nose to spite our face.

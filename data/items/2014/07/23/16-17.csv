Are you going to build it in Erlang, run it on several physical machines and do all the other fault-tollerant, high-availability stuff, or are you going to put together some pieces of Rails or PHP or Django and call it &#x27;pretty good&#x27;?  You&#x27;re going to do the latter, because otherwise you&#x27;re going to cost a <i>lot</i> more than the competition, deliver less, and in any case the guy running the business is going to be understanding if you need to take the site down for an hour on Sunday morning to upgrade something once in a while.<p>So far, so good.  Security is a bit more problematic, because there can be some pretty serious financial ramifications.  The trick is to get the people who bear those risks to pay some of what it costs to produce better software, which is not always easy in the case of open source.",1406134679

We&#x27;ve learnt from the Windows and mobile App Stores that you can wind up in this position with and without creative output penalties and management bullshit.<p>> <i>Microsoft has been in decline for 15 years and a large part of that is stack-ranking, which goes hand-in-hand with closed allocation.</i><p>It&#x27;s definitely declining.

This decline has taken the form of a business so profitable that 4 out of 5 divisions <i>by themselves</i> would qualify as Fortune 500 entries.<p>And Google has been drinking cash from the same river for its entire life. The only diversification from advertising revnue they have is mobile devices, and it&#x27;s only because they <i>bought Motorola outright</i>.<p>If you own a gold mine, you make profits because the market demands gold. Not because you are good to your staff, or bad to your staff. What makes you successful is the ownership of the gold mine.<p>Like I said, you have (so far as I can tell) one and only one example of any seriousness.

EMBA programs tend to be tailored to people who already have a relatively significant position within an organization. My understanding is that a large majority of people attending these programs have them payed for by their employers. The idea is to provide additional training to people who will have future, higher level roles within the organization.<p>I think that there are probably different flavors of this type of program depending on where you attend, but from my observations (regular MBA who had some minor interactions with EMBA&#x27;s during school), they tend to fly/drive in for the weekends and return to work during the week. Depending on the program, you may or may not be exposed to &quot;hard skills&quot; such as finance, accounting, etc, as there is a presumption that students already have some of these skills. My understanding is the focus tends to be more on soft skills like leadership, management, etc, which will help competent employees become better managers in the future.<p>From the way you posed your question, it sound like you are thinking about paying for this yourself.

Compared to Fitbit (put something on; remember to start it), apps (remember to start it) and others, I was hoping it would be frictionless -- hop into bed, start collecting metrics.  Unfortunately, aside from the long (long) time required to deliver a useful Android app, it&#x27;s failed me in a few ways.<p>1. You need the app running to collect metrics from the device (so, still some friction).  I forget the app all the time; at the end of the day, I drop my phone on a charger and crawl into bed.  Relying on humans to actively intervene is, unfortunately, suboptimal.<p>2. I was hoping it&#x27;d attach to my wifi and dump metrics to an API I could query (there&#x27;s no smart alarm, so attaching it to my own stack of stuff seemed cool).  Unfortunately, it sends data via a private Bluetooth protocol to your phone, rather than the wifi.  Intercepting this is non-trivial (although the Android Bluetooth debugging stack helps).  I&#x27;m trying to build a receiver on the Pi currently.<p>3. The API still doesn&#x27;t really exist.<p>My use case is slightly different from others.  I&#x27;ve got a chronic condition, and I&#x27;m not really interested in &quot;did I sleep well last night?&quot;, which Beddit seems to have targeted.  I&#x27;m much more interested in trends over a period of time, once my illness flares -- &quot;am I waking up more often?&quot;, &quot;how much time am I spending in bed, rather than active?&quot;, &quot;over the past week, how many times have I gotten up -- should I see a doctor?&quot;.  This should correlate with other smart devices (scales -- &quot;how much weight have I lost?&quot;; fitbit -- &quot;am I still relatively active?&quot;) to give me a more holistic view of my health.  So, long-term data retention is important to me (CockroachDB looks quite neat!).<p>Smart alarms and overnight statistics are interesting, but I hope companies developing devices for the quantified self start to pay more attention to long-term health data.  It paints a far more interesting story :).",1406134285

Are the trajectories (e.g. rank vs time) for all popular posts of the same shape?  They look ~logarithmic.<p>2. Are there identifiable clusters when you look in 4d space for rank vs points vs comments?<p>3. How does the impact of a post depend quantitatively on its respective cohort.  I.e., what&#x27;s a good model to normalize performance based on what else was happening that day?<p>4. What fraction of posts have comment threads that are &quot;hijacked&quot; by the first comment? Is their a quantitative way to find this, perhaps by looking at (2) above?<p>5. What are more detailed metrics to collapse &quot;performance&quot; of a post onto a single number?<p>6. How does performance on HN compare to reddit, etc?<p>7. How is the HN community different than other communities, if at all?<p>8.

Tons of services exploit this loophole (free conference calls, adult chat lines, phone-to-ip services, to name a few).<p>It is enabled by &quot;common carrier&quot; laws, meaning a phone carrier is legally obligated to connect these calls (to typically rural locations) even if it is at a loss. The connecting local service can charge absurd rates at a high profit margin. To further increase profits, the local services typically offer kickbacks as incentive for internet/VOIP services to connect through their phone numbers. So a rural county with only a small population can have an absurdly high volume of expensive calls flowing through them, all on the carrier&#x27;s dime.<p>This is why Google Voice refuses to connect calls through to certain rural areas, something that US carriers complain about, since they feel Google should be subject to these same laws.

When you start, it&#x27;s great - there&#x27;s just you and the drawings. You can make anything happen. But once you start to want to make something bigger than a couple of seconds, things get complicated; you have to plan a script, wrangle multiple scenes, start involving other people to break up the process in various ways - inbetweeners fill in frames between what the lead animator draws, cleanup artists neaten things up, colorists, background painters, 3D people for stuff that&#x27;s a pain to do by hand... plus all the non-drawing support people. Watch the credits at the end of any animated feature. All of them. Every single one of those people put in a lot of hours to make that film happen; not all of them did work that shows up directly on the screen. But all of those people had an important part to play, and all of them had to have ways to communicate with each other.<p>I burnt out on that because I didn&#x27;t want to be a cog in a machine designed to tell stories to the largest possible market.

I have template InDesign documents, scripts to help fill those templates, friends willing to try to make sense of the in-progress work and tell me when things don&#x27;t make sense, sprawling directory structures full of source files and web/print res files, sketchbooks full of planning, etc etc etc. It helps that I was already able to wrangle a website; I&#x27;m slowly turning my custom templates into something anyone who wants to present a comic online the same way I am can use. If I wanted to start telling a lot more stories a lot more quickly, I could start parallelizing: separate the job into writer/artist/colors/lettering, find an existing publisher willing to handle packaging/printing/distributing to comic stores, bookstores, and e-stores, as well as shop it around to Hollywood.<p>I can knock out a nice standalone drawing in a few hours.

Her music is ultimately popular because people like it. I don&#x27;t think people think Wrecking Ball is a better song because the video was over-the-top, nor would a wild video make me like a song I would otherwise hate.

I&#x27;m sure there are other cases where an artist receives more press attention that does not correlate to increased music sales.<p>Chris Brown has had nothing but bad press since he hit Rhianna a few years ago and he&#x27;s still placing songs on the charts and radio. People seem to mostly dislike him, but will still listen to his music. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re listening to him because he hit a woman and is in and out of jail.

The MVNO resellers mostly seem to go prepay, I know I paid $300 for my phone some time ago, but I only pay $22 per month for voice and psuedo-unlimited data so I&#x27;m pretty happy.<p>It is interesting that Amazon is kinda in between, kinda a subprime loan seller and kinda a phone service reseller, probably for financial reasons.<p>Amazon does seem to be financializing itself, they do push their credit card every time I buy.

Producing numbers is not an easy thing here, since there is no definitive way to count this globally (a concrete factual example was shown by CDPR though with their Witcher game).<p>However that&#x27;s not even the main point. Even if DRM doesn&#x27;t boost piracy significantly, the main issue here is that doesn&#x27;t deter it, while on the other hand it punishes paying customers.<p><i>> If it was beneficial for a company&#x27;s bottom line to abandon DRM they would do it, so why don&#x27;t they?</i><p>Several possible reasons, none of them good and valid though.

You can build a fully autonomous quadcopter for ~$500 these days (minus the transmitter).<p>The problems I see are regulation, and battery performance.<p>Regulations are really up in the air right now. There have been two rulings by judges that the FAA&#x27;s current policies do not cover restriction of commercial usage for drones. The FAA is actively fighting this. I feel that over the next few years, we&#x27;ll see some solid rules set down, and more than likely they&#x27;ll be extremely strict to start. Statistically speaking, the FAA has an amazing track record, and letting anyone into the skies has a real chance of marring that record substantially.<p>Cell power density is getting better and better, but it still takes a lot of work to get over an hour flight time on a multirotor. Thus they tend to be used for on-spot and precision flying shots for video. Fixed wing drones on the other hand have amazing range (I&#x27;ve seen 70km+ flights), but are less capable in the precision flying that a multirotor provides.<p>On this topic, I am a huge fan of what Chris Anderson is doing over at 3DRobotics. Their open-source APM is the flight controller I choose for most of my projects, and it is extremely configurable.<p>Hope this helps :)",1406131234

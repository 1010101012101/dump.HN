9903682,comment,9902244,9902594,0,0,joeld42,,,"Cycles is hard to use for animation because it is very noisy, it&#x27;s fast to get an initial image (great for tweaking) but it&#x27;s slow to get a noise-free image. Also this includes pixar&#x27;s &quot;denoising as a post process&quot; which is really amazing (and might even be applicable to cycles renders).<p>Cycles shading graph is very limited (but well chosen) compared to the flexibility of Renderman Shading Language.<p>Renderman&#x27;s subpixel shading is just amazing, so getting crisp, antialiased renders even with fine detail is automatic, whereas cycles might require tweaking the settings or really cranking up the sample rate.<p>Cycles struggles and has memory limitations on large (even not so large) scenes.<p>Renderman produces very good motion blur without much performance hit, which is critical for integrating with real-world footage.<p>Renderman has a lot of features (similar to plugins) to integrate with external tech (e.g. you could plug in a custom hair generator step), which is critical for production.<p>Renderman has a lot of &quot;scalability&quot; features like caching indirect lighting into brickmaps, or loading large sets of tiled textures, that cycles (or even blender) just don&#x27;t support.<p>Also, renderman has been used in production for decades, so a lot of places have built up large libraries of tricks, shaders or tools that work with renderman that they can use.<p>Renderman is well integrated with many render-farm technologies, so if you&#x27;re working on a large animation there are some great option. Of course there are ways to do this with Cycles, too, but they are generally less mature and lack some production features.<p>With all of that said, cycles is still an amazingly powerful renderer, and completely free (not just free to use). You don&#x27;t have to generate and install a license file to use Cycles, and if you want to tinker with the source code, you can do so! That&#x27;s not going to happen with renderman anytime soon...",1437152380

Don&#x27;t try to sell yourself as a LinkedIn alternative.<p>LinkedIn is where I go when I want to find someone important in company X that I wouldn&#x27;t normally have access to, typically in functions that are usually outside of my normal circle. E.g. I got two separate SVP&#x27;s at DHL to personally interfere to get a package I was waiting for redirected when their local customer service was being useless once.<p>It&#x27;s where I go when I want to find recruiters with contacts in the right companies, whether to hire or to be hired.<p>It&#x27;s where I go when I want to research companies to see if they&#x27;re a good fit to work at, or a good fit to partner with etc.<p>It&#x27;s where I go when I want to contact someone I&#x27;ve worked with in the past but not closely enough to e.g. have them on facebook or have their current phone number or e-mail. This last one appears to be pretty much the only one that fits your model, except I often want people outside of the techies.<p>This is why I&#x27;m reasonably active (couple of times a month) on LinkedIn, and not at all (once a year at most) on Facebook. For me, you&#x27;d fall closer to the Facebook end of the spectrum based on your homepage.

But who says we want to restrict ourselves to empirical predictions? The problem in your reasoning is that everything in the real world is mediated for us by the simulated, subjective world. A click on the mouse in the &quot;real world&quot; might have some effect on the world of Minecraft, but the nature of that effect is determined by the rules of the simulated world -- not objective, physical reality. We should limit ourselves to empiricism when <i>we want</i> (subjective) to do stuff that interacts with physical reality, like build an airplane. But what if we want to laugh? Is a joke less real than an airplane?<p>> whereas people without a humanities education seem to still have the supposed benefits of one.<p>That is not true. People without humanities education have humanities knowledge comparable to grade-school math. It&#x27;s more than nothing, sure, but it&#x27;s far from making one knowledgeable. It is an extreme example, but there&#x27;s a fascinating fringe group (mostly centered in and about Silicon Valley) called the Dark Enlightenment or neo-reactionism. They are similar in many ways to other historical groups, but different in others. In any case, they are mostly STEM people who have some historical beliefs that are completely erroneous, precisely because they believe what you just said (and that makes the movement all the more interesting).<p>> All I can say is that in ordinary, everyday life, I suspect you find questions (ordinary everyday questions like &quot;where are my car keys?&quot;) to be only as valuable as their answers.<p>Sure, but why restrict ourselves to ordinary, everyday life? Do you think that human existence lies solely at that level?<p>> You can construct a whole anti-inductive edifice of beliefs that stand alone, but if they&#x27;re completely disconnected from anything in real life<p>Here&#x27;s that word again: real. Is a joke not real? What makes physical reality any more real than simulated reality? Is euclidean geometry any more real than non-euclidean geometry simply because we find the former in objective physical reality? Is, say, Call of Duty any more real than Minecraft or Super Mario simply because it imitates physical reality better? They&#x27;re both simulations. Certainly some things are more <i>physical</i> than others, but whether that gives them any more value is completely subjective.",1437152215

I don&#x27;t think that makes this code useless by any means, but I think it&#x27;s important to be aware of the edge cases.<p>Consensus algorithms are popular because they&#x27;re supposed to solve the difficult problem of <i>guaranteeing</i> consistency while attempting to provide liveness, in the presence of <i>arbitrary</i> node or connection failures. Etcd itself can provide this for operations on its own datastore, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can be used as a perfect failure detector for another system (which is impossible in the general case). In particular, if the database master becomes partitioned from the etcd leader for more than 30 seconds but is still accessible to clients, boom -- split brain.<p>(You can attempt to mitigate this with timeouts, but that&#x27;s not foolproof if your system can experience clock skew or swapping/GC delays. Exactly this kind of faulty assumption has caused critical bugs in e.g. HBase in the past, turning what would otherwise be a temporary period of unavailability into data loss.)<p>EDIT: If I&#x27;m reading the code correctly, compose.io doesn&#x27;t make any attempt to mitigate this failure scenario.

You can only connect numbers that are at the left, right, top, bottom of the last selected number. As a faster alternative, you can also drag/swipe through the numbers.<p>When the sum of the chain ends in zero (ie. sum % 10 = 0) you get rewards and side effects depending on whether the chain&#x27;s length is composite or prime.<p>- if it&#x27;s composite (e.g. chain length is 4, 6, or 8 digits long), you gain 2 seconds on your time for each digit connected. However, each digit also gives you a 1 in 4 chance of replacing a digit in the grid with a &quot;blocker&quot;, a cell that cannot be selected.\n- if it&#x27;s prime (e.g. 2, 3, 5), you only gain 0.5 seconds for each digit, but instead of spawning blockers, each digit now has a 1 in 5 chance of removing a blocker in the grid.<p>Either way, the point value of the chain is ((sum / 10) ^ 3) * 5.<p>So connecting 1-2-3-4 gives you 5 points and 8 extra seconds but has 4 chances of spawning blockers. On the other hand, connecting 9-3-8 gives you 40 points, 1.5 extra seconds, and 3 chances to clear blockers.<p>Game ends when the time runs out. The goal is 1 million points, but the game will not stop you from playing when you reach that point.",1437151378

Firstly, I don&#x27;t think it is well substantiated, and there are numerous examples to the contrary- Microsoft, Standard Oil, United Fruit, telecoms, airlines, railroads- almost anything which requires significant initial investment to grow. But, more importantly- why distinguish between capitalism and what you call &quot;state corporatism&quot;? The corporations who lobby the state, or coerce the state, or even cause the formation of an authoritarian state in ways that work in their favor are merely being good capitalists- they&#x27;re simply better at competing than other capitalists! When United Fruit coerces the US government into supporting a foreign coup, or a corporation coerces the police or military to massacre striking workers, or big oil asks for huge subsidies- it&#x27;s no different from a capitalist perspective then investing in advertising or aggressive expansion, and all are about increasing control and centralizing power. If there were no state corporatism, how long would it be before a capitalist caused it to come about? Campaign finance laws, monopoly regulations, and public opinion can be rolled back or simply ignored until power is consolidated; the inherent unequal distribution of power in capitalism means that a comparative few people will always be capable of doing this. In the words of Woodrow Wilson: &quot;If there are men in this country big enough to own the US government, they are going to own it&quot;. State corporatism, monopology, and inevitably authoritarianism are the end game of capitalism, not a perversion. You can&#x27;t put limits on the definition of capitalism so that the second anyone is any good at it, and the most obvious oppression that being good at capitalism causes is then apparent, that suddenly it&#x27;s &quot;not capitalism&quot; anymore because they didn&#x27;t play by your rules in a system where the actual rules are what those with money say they are.

It correctly identifies human error (a platoon leader misreading a map, for example) as one reason why a commander&#x27;s intelligence about the status of his own units may be incorrect, but there&#x27;s other factors that can cause such problems as well, such as:<p>- <i>Communications latency:</i> the time between an order being issued and its being received can be significant, and lead to units following orders that were based on a situation which no longer exists, or disregarding orders because by the time the orders arrive the situation looks different to them than it did to HQ<p>- <i>Subordinate initiative:</i> lower-ranking units have their own leaders too, and those leaders have free will just like the Big Brass at HQ does, which means that sometimes they take action on their own authority, either in the absence of or in contradiction to existing orders<p>A textbook example of the latter problem is Union general Dan Sickles&#x27; advance on the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg (see: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg,_Second_Day#Sickles_repositions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg,_Second_D...</a>). Sickles&#x27; corps was part of the long &quot;fish-hook&quot; defensive line that the overall Union commander, Gen. George Meade, had formed his army into after the Confederate assaults the day before. But, seeing slightly higher ground in front of his position, Sickles on his own authority marched his corps forward to occupy that ground. The result was disastrous; Sickles&#x27; troops were too far forward for the rest of the Union line to support them, so they were smashed when the Confederates hit later that day.<p>This type of thing is extremely hard to model in a wargame, because ultimately players want to feel that their winning or losing is down to the decisions they made, not due to random factors or the game itself pushing against them. So, while balky subordinates like Sickles are not uncommon in real life, how do you model that in a way that doesn&#x27;t make the player feel that the game is essentially playing itself? It&#x27;s a sufficiently hard question to answer that most designers don&#x27;t even bother to try.",1437151209

Monopolies in a market economy can only exist if they&#x27;ve had no competitors and have met all of their customers needs and defeated all competition. Google is a monopoly, because it&#x27;s something we&#x27;re all generally pretty happy with. Even the slightest downfalls in Google lead to competitors taking advantage of that. Say data privacy for example, Google were subpar there, so Duckduckgo gained major momentum. Market competition will almost always prevent monopolies. Monopolies occur within our current model because state regulation, state taxes (including corporate tax relief) create what&#x27;s known as a &#x27;barrier to market&#x27;. Meaning it&#x27;s far, far more difficult for a competitor to actually compete on a product level.<p>Most of our debt&#x27;s occur because interest rates are so high, and why are interest rates so high? Because they&#x27;re pegged above inflation, and why do we have inflation?

And the rewards and Nobel prizes went to those who did the math the fastest.<p>So the whole theoretical physics adopted this style of work, when someone proposes something new that looks interesting, everyone tries to do the math as quickly as possible, to be the first to get the results.<p>But then from the 70s to 00s, this flocking attitude was applied to string theory, and people just developed string math furiously, and it was left unnoticed that the theory was totally unrelated to any experiments.<p>So, Smolin suggests, for 30 years the best of theoretical physics went into a direction that may be totally separated from experiments.

Once you start assigning values, you&#x27;ll find no objective justification.<p>I think there is consensus (at least among people, philosophers included, in their ordinary lives) on the value of helping more people. I can&#x27;t persuade someone who has different values from me to change them, and I wouldn&#x27;t try. But I think disagreements like the one I seem to have with the original post are more likely to be cases where we have similar values, but either disagree about the empirical facts, or one or other of us has made an error of reasoning.<p>> Finally, even the question of what constitutes knowledge is very tricky. The famous Gettier problem clearly shows that if we agree on a complete, robust definition of knowledge, we find that nothing we believe we know actually meets the definition.<p>Which is a flaw in philosophies that try to work with definitions. If we restrict ourselves to empirical predictions, Gettier&#x27;s examples cease to be paradoxical.<p>> As to your statement about STEM vs. humanities people, I could debate your assertions from my own personal experience all day long, but the mere fact that you chose to make it tells a lot about you and your priorities. What&#x27;s your point? That STEM people are smarter? Let&#x27;s suppose that they are. So what? Does that make them more valuable?<p>Actually my assumption was that they&#x27;re equally smart and my point was the opposite: that STEM education seems to impart some valuable abilities that those without STEM education do not have, whereas people without a humanities education seem to still have the supposed benefits of one. So my claim would be that an STEM education is more valuable than a humanities one.<p>> I think that is one question that is far more valuable than any answer you can find :)<p>Maybe we really do have different values. All I can say is that in ordinary, everyday life, I suspect you find questions (ordinary everyday questions like &quot;where are my car keys?&quot;) to be only as valuable as their answers. And that in ordinary, everyday life, you find things valuable only insofar as they connect to ordinary, everyday life. You can construct a whole anti-inductive edifice of beliefs that stand alone, but if they&#x27;re completely disconnected from anything in real life... well, I find I&#x27;m better off without them, and I expect you would too.",1437149853

The blues and twos are not just to get people to move out of the way, they are to inform other road users that you are there and may be speeding or performing other manoeuvres that are not normally permitted (or, at least, are generally frowned upon). Though while the exceptions allow breaking other rules in certain circumstances, there are both specific exceptions to the exceptions (there are limits to how fast the police can go in urban areas and so forth) and they are always couched in wording that means that general due diligence must be followed (the police are expected to use their judgement so even if operating within the set limits they could be reprimanded & charged if they cause damage/injury/death and it is successfully argued that no reasonable person would have taken the offending action under those circumstances.<p>Of course with agencies like the FBI there is a greater level of secrecy, so enforcement is more difficult.

I pushed really hard to be allowed to do work in Blender, wasn&#x27;t a win at the time, but I think this is clearly the direction things will go - the days of paying thousands of dollars for content creating software that is primarily used by a handful of companies are numbered.  Companies like Pixar and ILM should be contributing to projects like Blender instead of developing proprietary internal tools and marrying themselves to packages like Maya that aren&#x27;t terribly better than Blender, if they even are better at all anymore.<p>Blender has some quirks, esp in modeling from what I remember, but it&#x27;s solid, and more importantly, there are room for lots of tools, just not lots of tools that break the bank.

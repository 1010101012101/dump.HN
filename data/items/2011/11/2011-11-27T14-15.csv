As Pascal said earlier: ""La Chine obscurcit"" (China darkens).<p>The mafias and anarchist dystopia described by GP exists in China. In my nearly 9 years here I have received some reflections of this (random pick: I have spent a night near a children factory near Hong-Kong).<p>But saying that China, or even Wenzhou <i>is</i> an anarchist dystopia is wrong. It is similar to describing New-York with a picture from the Bronx during a ""bad day"".<p>On the opposite, saying that Wenzhou and other places are economic paradise where anyone can do whatever they want without the central government even being aware of this is false. These coastal regions have been set up as an experiment on economic opening by Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao have been in fact ""chosen"" by him, in order to continue in the same tracks. You can count on the current government to care about these places, and to be ready to do whatever is needed if it goes too far.<p>What is happening in China right now is impressive, and such a fast mutation is probably unseen in the world history at this scale.<p>It will have a great impact on the world. Will it be for the best or for the worst? I can't be sure, but what I know is that knowing better each other, increasing exchanges between West and East, is the best and only way we have to push a little, just a little bit, away from the worst case scenario.",1322405760

The dynamics of the market have changed and many that are claiming a bubble look at the market with the same dynamics that the .com bust had. It's hard not to do, given that it was pretty traumatic for everyone involved but there are different forces at work today and the market has become more resilient.

3282442,comment,3282160,3282160,5,0,asanwal,,,"Folks have been predicting this throughout 2010 as well as 2011.  The arguments are generally devoid of data, i.e., ""based on what we see"".<p>First, let me say, there will eventually be a decrease in funding levels primarily because the VC asset class is raising less money and since they can only invest what's in their bank accounts, it has to come down. When will that happen?  Not sure.<p>Here's some thoughts based on data we collect.<p>- 2011 is shaping up to be banner year for VCs ($30B+ invested)
- Seed investments whether by VCs, VCs & angels or just angels are growing like mad<p>If you think of investing as a funnel, i.e., more seed stage companies get funded than Series A than Series B, etc, it def looks like the funnel has gotten a bit fat up top, i.e. a lot more seed deals than Series A, B, etc money down the pipeline.<p>So if anything, the Seed thing has been overdone.  At the same time, many of those Seed companies can become real businesses on just the Seed round, i.e., SaaS companies (just look at UserVoice's second small round raise as a case study).  Or these companies get acquired for $20-$50 million.  Which is not a great return for a mega-VC who only care about billion dollar opportunities, but can be quite good for a micro-VC.  I'd imagine Dave McClure and others like 500Startups would be happy hitting those all day long.<p>That said, there is an overabundance of seed backed companies and many of these will be orphaned and die.  That's not a bad thing.  It's the market working.<p>At the same time, there are a lot more investors at the Seed stage and a lot more can pile in so the trend might continue for a while as everyone hopes to fund the next Facebook, Pinterest, Quora, etc (pick your soup du jour).  This is only natural as there are a lot more folks who can invest at the $1 million level than the $10 or $100 million level.<p>As to whether later rounds will decrease in # and a bubble exists, that can really only happen when the buyers (investors) decide not to pay crazy valuations.  I'm not sure what the 'forcing mechanism' will be that will drive this.  There is not a long list of public internet companies that will set the ""real price"" for these companies and cause a correction.  So without the forcing mechanism, it comes down to investors agreeing that valuations in private markets are  too high.  Not sure there is anything out there that would cause an across-the-board shift like that.  Of course, some investors might get more conservative but there looks to be no dearth of cowboys investing right now.<p>Finally, this could all change if the stock market and general economy go into a tailspin.  If I could predict that with any precision (or if anyone could), we're in the wrong business.<p>Some links for those interested in some data -<p>Startup Cash Crunch?

I am not only talking about the stuff in the 7 Habits but also all the additional books and presentations that he has done. I have found it extremely difficult to maintain that win-win perspective myself and it has been even more difficult helping my team members do the same. I think it is because our natural instincts tend to push us towards competitiveness even when we know things work out better when everyone is on the same side.<p>Even outside of work, in my personal life I often think about this principal and push myself and my wife to figure out ways to create win-win situations.<p>RIP, Stephen Covey.

4252242,comment,4245737,4246132,0,0,bluesnowmonkey,,,"> What's fundamentally wrong about date.addDays(1) vs. date_add_days(date, 1)?<p>One issue involves cross-cutting concerns.  Say I'm creating a JSON API for my system.  I use an API framework that lets me return objects that implement a JsonSerializable interface, and the framework calls to_json() to create the actual network response.  The built in container classes (Hash, Array, etc.) implement this interface already, calling to_json() on their elements.  I make all my core domain classes implement a JsonSerializable interface with to_json() methods.  Now I can return an array of objects and it just works.  Very straightforward.<p>Problem 1: I only need to_json for the API, but now that code is available everywhere.  Every time I change my JSON API, it requires recompilation and testing of every component of the system, whether or not they are even related to the API.<p>Problem 2: Next I go on to add an XML API, HTML representations, database persistence, third party API integration.  All those concerns go into my core domain classes, which become quite bloated.  I could use decorator classes, but they require me to be aware of whether I'm using a decorated or non-decorated object.  They also add a lot of boilerplate.  Code becomes both bloated and ugly.<p>Problem 3: Next I need a new version of the JSON API, to be run concurrently with the old one. The new version is going to serialize things in a different style, so each class needs two versions of to_json().  I could make a to_json2(), but how would the API framework know to call it?  I fork the framework.  Now I have to merge my changes every time they release a new version of the framework.  Code is bloated, ugly, and unmaintainable.<p>Problem 4: Next I need to return API responses with classes from third party libraries, for which I don't even have the source to fork.  Fuck.<p>Ultimate solution is to wrap everything -- foo_as_json(foo), bar_as_json(bar), foo_as_xml(foo).  It's ugly as hell but it's the only thing that basically works.",1342468527

4252223,comment,4250581,4251291,2,0,SiVal,,,"Or, remap the hjkl of vim, a ridiculous legacy of an obsolete keyboard Bill Joy just happened to be using at the time, to the normal inverted-T of cursor movement: ijkl. Then continue using the ""arrowkeys"" that are now under your right hand on the home row.<p>You'll then need to move the insert on left side of cursor, which was i, to h, the key on the left side of your index finger. Reach left to insert left. Easy for muscle memory. With that, both sets of arrowkeys on the keyboard work the same, and you won't need to disable one of them. Normal arrowkey muscle memory, and reach left to insert left. So easy.<p>Bill Joy was working in an era when keyboards didn't have separate arrowkeys and the ESC key was within easy reach. He wanted it to be as easy as possible to remember lots of different command keys. He used what was printed on his key caps, such as a straight line of arrows on hjkl and various English words such as ""yank"" in his design. It was a good idea at the time. He also realized that keyboards varied, so he made it all remappable to adapt to future keyboard designs--also a good idea.<p>But the programmers themselves couldn't adapt. The choices Joy made for that obsolete keyboard were frozen in amber by programmers whose habits were frozen in amber. These days, almost all keyboards have real arrowkeys, and people develop the muscle memory to use them long before they ever hear of vim. Also the ESC key, such a fundamental key, is off in Siberia.<p>For every vim user with vim habits based on an obsolete keyboard they don't use, there are 10,000 potential vim users with keyboarding habits based on the modern keyboards they DO use. Those 10,000 people use inverted-T arrowkeys, x/c/v as cut, copy, paste, they can't reach their ESC key, etc. Vim was designed to adapt, but old vimmers apparently weren't, so the design features that give vim its power are forever stuck behind arbitrary key layouts optimized for the wrong keyboard.<p>It makes more sense to remain consistent with existing muscle memory and keyboards, using the inverted-T arrangement ijkl, mapping your left-side insert to the left side key ('h'), and mapping ESC to something easy to reach, such as ';;'. Then, if you ever need to use a non-customized vim, just use the real arrowkeys, which will still feel natural. If you ever need to use another app with a serious vi mode, like zsh, it will be remappable to match your vi. (If it's not a serious vi mode but just a couple of vi-like keyboard shortcuts, either use the arrowkeys or do what we always do, given that every app has its own unique set of keyboard shortcuts: just learn a few new shortcuts for that app.)",1342468231

Right now, the only way to serve images optimally for the various screens is to have the server attempt to assess the display resolution for the client using either JavaScript or CSS media queries, and then either send different HTML to different clients, with different content linked in img tags, or have exception handling for the CSS images.<p>This is completely broken, as a client that wishes to access various assets might be denied them by the server, which thinks it knows best what's good for the client. This system is also bound to break as clients with unexpected capabilities emerge. Instead, the server should be dumb, making all the assets available, and the client should be making the decision of which assets to request.<p>Apple is the obvious source of expected progress on this front, since they control the retina hardware, OS and browser rendering engine. Others are able to influence this as well. Until <i>someone</i> fixes this broken mess we have now, however, retina users will not be getting widespread support. We can't expect big website operators to put up with the current horrible hacks people are using to support retina displays.",1342468017

That refinement happens in a loop;  you move stuff around, do a little nip tuck, maybe attempt to fix some bugs, and then run the module (or the tests).  Optimizing this loop is important (it's one of the major benefits of scripting languages);  once you figure out what change you should make, or what experiment you should run, the faster you make it happen, the faster you get the results, and the faster you can get back to the important mental aspect of figuring out how to fix or create whatever you're working on.",1342467936

At the same time, I don't think it's a real answer to the NY Times article. You're not going to make friends over one dinner.<p>I've gone to a couple GrubWithUs dinners, and they were great. I met interesting people, had interesting conversations, and even made some new acquaintances.<p>I didn't ""make friends,"" though. That's a much different thing, and comes from a different place. The original NY Times article made great points about our changing nature as we mature getting in the way of deep friendships. That's all true, but there are also logistical practicalities.<p>The great friends you make in school or college are people that you saw every day, or at least every week, in class and around campus. You shared groups and activities, whether it was a sport, a band, drama club, your D&D group, whatever. Friendship takes repeated exposure in mundane situations.<p>I've had some great, intense experiences with acquaintances as an adult. A few years ago, I took a cross-country road trip with a guy that I met through a mutual friend. I was writing an article about the Smart Car, and he was my photographer. We drove 4,000 miles over 12 days, and had a great time. We both live in New York, and I even run into him at the occasional show. Without a regular, everyday reason to hang out, though, we just faded into acquaintances.<p>For people who want to have real friendships as adults, maybe what we need is some kind of structure in our lives that more closely resembles what people have earlier in life. For myself, I still have a D&D group, and while I don't want to hang out with everyone all the time, I have made some real and lasting friendships in the group. I'm sure most people could think of some way to find structure and camaraderie on a regular basis. I don't think GrubWithUs really does that, though.",1342467845

If WebGL were to really take off/become a popular way of distributing/consuming PC games, which would be 10 or 100x more likely to happen if Windows supported it out of the box via Internet Explorer, you would have to expect to see lots of relatively inexpensive and even free 3D games that run in the browser, and take little or no time to install.<p>Even with Microsoft refusing to support it, now with Pointer Lock API coming very soon to a regular Firefox release (tomorrow??) and probably Chrome soon also, it will be possible to release a FPS or MMO on a website with native browser technology.  Throw in the momentum and capabilities of Node.js, and I think that means choosing a web stack has big advantages as far as ease of development for a lot of multiplayer 3D games.<p>I also think that where JavaScript/JS-based languages like CoffeeScript are really going to shine and be popular is in scripting for multiplayer 3D environments online.<p>I think that mainly we are just waiting for Pointer Lock, maybe a tiny bit better collaboration between browser and driver developers, and some social momentum.<p>When WebGL takes off, Microsoft Windows sales will take a big hit because people will be able to play the popular games on Macs or even on Linux machines.",1342467281

That Barbara Kyle lady from the Electronics Take Back Coalition says <i>""We seriously doubt that these MacBooks should qualify for EPEAT at any level because we think they flunk two required criteria in the 'Design for End of Life' section of the standard.""</i> They <i>think</i> it flunks. Has that been shown?<p>The article goes on to say <i>Those criteria are ""4.3.1.3 Easy disassembly of external enclosure,"" and ""4.3.1.5 Identification and removal of components containing hazardous materials."" Kyle noted that the glue makes the battery difficult to remove ""safely,"" which is ""exactly the kind of design that this standard seeks to discourage.""</i><p>So, has it yet been shown that Kyle is right about the glue?

They actually sound a lot more ""religious"" (in the sense people use it these days) than you'd think. They're often a tirade of rants against Christianity and religion in general with no call to reason or any honest examination of the deep questions at hand. (meaning of life, problem of evil, ...) I've found C.S. Lewis to be much more intellectually stimulating in this regard. Even though he takes a Christian stance, his reasoning/logic quite dispassionate/unbiased compared to what's out there. (at least in Mere Christianity).<p>I've also found discussion groups useful in this regard.

You can also write concatenative programs and logical programs. Why not we suggest that people should be required to learn about beating around the stack and predicates first?<p>What makes functional programming so special? The hubris of its followers?<p>I can tell you now what makes imperative programming special. It allows all other kinds of programming to function. And it's the most used kind - by large. So, sorry. Basics are just so big that they won't fit any FP concepts. Loops, variables, procedures, branches, arrays. There you go. Be blessed and do not sin.<p>P. S. The whole concept of immutability linguistically depends on the default of mutability. Where did that default came from? Math does not have the concept of mutability. It came from imperative programming!\nSo, we are told that people should learn basic things, whose definition depends on understanding non-basic things.",1342465456

I couldn't care less about start-ups.  I'm happy that they exist, I appreciate the innovations they create, and I enjoy the fruits of their labors, but to act as if the alpha and omega of existence is solving the problem of what causes start-ups to fail is IMO fundamentally both arrogant and wrong headed, because start-ups represent only a small percentage of the tech world at large.",1342465396

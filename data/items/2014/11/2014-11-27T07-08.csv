- then tell them that you&#x27;re also not interested in them really.

Define &#x27;efficient&#x27;. If you&#x27;re talking about cost, it costs far less than an asic below a certain volume, and it certainly costs less in tooling and development.<p>&quot;FPGA&#x27;s are hot and slow&quot; - compared to a full custom IC? Sure. FPGA&#x27;s improve with every process generation (like all silicon devices) and an ASIC design won&#x27;t intrinsically take advantage of those advances; an FPGA design that didn&#x27;t meet it&#x27;s power or thermal envelope 5 years ago might easily do so now, without incurring the NRE of the ASIC - add to that the fact that the first stage of the ASIC design can be prototyped via the FPGA, and you have a viable product without the risk of a bad ASIC.<p>I&#x27;ve been involved in converting several Virtex-2 designs to newer devices - the huge reduction in power and increase in available logic has led to some extremely impressive gains. There is work to do in such a conversion, but it is understood work - there&#x27;s no real mystery to updating the CoreGen components.<p>Agree it is a useless article though, because digital logic design is not programming (it is architectural work). There is no &#x27;abstracting&#x27; that away - all attempts thus far have failed miserably (Vivado HLS, for example, turns out designs that work but are HUGE compared to what even a passable designer can do).",1417073303

  2.) Get Involved
  3.) Get Hacking!

</code></pre>
In your case there would also be step #0 pick a field. In most cases,
step #1 seems overwhelming. There is a ton of work in just getting
familiar with the basics in a given field. With the fields you
mentioned, I&#x27;d start with universities. There are tons of universities
with departments/schools specializing in the fields you mentioned, and
the majority of them have publicly accessible projects. You could
literally spend months quickly reading all the various projects/code
from universities with Bioinformatics departments, and that doesn&#x27;t
include the related research papers. Take your time, and be patient. Try
to quickly cover as many of the projects as you can find, and remember
your goal is to just get familiar with all of the work that is currently
getting done by all of the related, but separate, groups. Keep Notes.<p>Once you&#x27;re familiar with the bulk of the projects out there, decide on
something that interests you a lot, and get involved by contacting the
group. Get to know them. Get to know their published research. If you
have any difficulty with the people, it won&#x27;t be any fun working with
them, so politely disconnect and move onto another project.<p>When you find a project that interests you and people you want to work
with, then get hacking. Learn the codebase. Since every project has
bugs, start with the bug reports, and providing patches. Do not be
surprised or upset if your patch is not accepted -- this happens a lot
when you&#x27;re first starting out on a new codebase. Ask for feedback on
both your approved patches and your rejected patches. Try to learn from
the feedback of people who know the codebase and conventions better than
you do, but remember to respect the time of others.<p>Always stay classy, and civil, and committed. --And if you figure out
how to always be classy, civil, and committed, then tell me how. ;)",1417072299

I can utilize a link to send 1kbit/s for a month, which is 2.47Tbit of data transferred. That sounds like a lot, but what burden does 1kbit/s place on your provider? Virtually nil. And yet carriers with data caps will charge massive overage fees or heavily throttle usage because of usage like this.<p>AWS bills per-byte for outbound data, so I&#x27;ll use that for a concrete example. Lets say that I have a small service that uses 1gbit/s for 30 days.<p><pre><code>  Commodity transit:
  billed at 95th percentile

  $1000 circuit commit

  AWS:

  $0.05 / GByte (using their cheapest tier for simplicity)
  = $16,200 / mo

There is no major difference here between what it costs the provider to transfer my packets. If anything, Amazon can get better deals on transit than a small startup can. Yet I would pay Amazon nearly ten times as much, simply because their billing metric does not bear any relation to their cost to serve. This is rent-seeking behavior and it should not be allowed to become the default way that ISPs and other service providers bill customers.",1417071929

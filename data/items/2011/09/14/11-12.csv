2995852,comment,2995362,2995481,1,0,NickPollard,,,"I think this is largely true, but the converse is that the only big reason people buy iPhones IS the 'cool factor' (ie. marketing). That's why HTC want to challenge that.<p>In the UK at least, I see a lot of people with iPhones and also a lot with android phones (mostly HTCs). However, when people see my Nexus One, they often say 'Oh is that an iPhone?' because the word iPhone is synonymous with touchscreen phones. The iPhone has the brand and the public awareness which is what helps it sell.<p>If HTC or other Android partners manage to erode that, they could stand to gain heavily. A huge portion of smartphone customers really don't know or care about the differences (good or bad) between one smartphone and another.",1316001504

Can you simplify it?<p>Zooming in and out of the map with the mouse wheel doesn't work.<p>Too many error messages. Instead of saying ""you didn't pick any destination"", ask me to pick one from a list or predictive textbox.<p>Don't show me destinations to which there are no routes. Spending five minutes clicking around to get an error message in the end is no fun.<p>Don't separate the to and from locations so much visually. Tabs don't feel right for that kind of thing. Anyway, it's just two fields, just show them together.<p>You didn't completely carry through the concept of going from place to place, rather than airport to airport. When I search for Paris as my destination, you show me a dot on Paris the city, and couple of dots for the airports. My instinct is to click on the dot for the city, not the airports. Let me select the dot for the city.<p>You could make this really intuitive by getting rid of the text boxes entirely. Let me just click on the map to do everything.

After adjustment for the heaviness of the work, psychosocial job factors, income, and biological and behavioral risk factors, the mean change in maximum IMT for those standing not at all, a little, a lot, and very much was 0.24, 0.25, 0.28, and 0.33 mm, respectively. For men with IHD the respective changes were 0.08, 0.15, 0.37, and 0.75 mm -- a 9-fold difference between the no-exposure and high-exposure group. For the men with carotid stenosis, the respective difference was 3-fold.\n""""""<p>Do I read this correctly in saying that for men without IHD, the ones who stood all day had their artery walls thicken by  0.33mm over four years while those who stood not at all had theirs thicken by 0.24mm?  And that the nine-fold increase is only for people with ischaemic heart disease?  So the article is wrong: it's not 900% but 37% in people who don't have IHD?<p>The idea is that thicker artery walls are associated with heart disease, right?

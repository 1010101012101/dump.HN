One of the trees is very old, but quite healthy, standing at least 50 feet high.  The other was just planted a few months ago, so is still quite small.<p>You're not the one that's going to cut the trees down, and the cost to do so will be the same in both cases (let's say that the higher cost to cut down the bigger tree is offset by the fact that the person cutting it down wants the wood for himself) - which tree do you cut down, and why?<p>Now, this doesn't seem like a moral issue.  Almost everyone would cut down the smaller tree, for several reasons: it would take less time to grow a new one of the same size, we wouldn't be destroying as much previous ""work"", etc.  Very logical, can't really argue with it.<p>But I lied.  When I said ""maple tree"", what I really meant was ""human"", and when I said ""you need to build a path to your house,"" what I <i>really</i> meant was ""we're all in a flimsy lifeboat, there's a nasty shark circling, and it wants it some tasty human gubbins[1], so we either need to toss overboard the 50 year old award winning medical research doctor with a loving family of six waiting for him at home, or a newborn baby. Or else we <i>all</i> die!""<p>[Edit: As I pointed out in response to some of the comments, I probably should have made the doctor younger, to avoid questions about whether he's already used up most of his potential.  I'd encourage you to think about what age he'd need to be to change your decision...]<p>Anyone here <i>actually</i> willing to stand up and say they'd toss the baby?  Because from a pure utilitarian point of view, it's the logical thing to do - a newborn baby is a roll of the dice, likely to turn out as a completely average adult, with zero expected value above and beyond any other newborn baby that the same couple has, so they might as well just make another one. OTOH the professor has proven himself to be near the top of the usefulness curve, and the expected value of his remaining years is likely far greater than that of the newborn, even after we factor in the mother's grief over losing her baby.<p>It's a rare person that would actually make the choice to toss the baby - I certainly don't think I could, but I can't really pin down my logic to anything more compelling (in a rational sense) than ""But it's a <i>baby</i>, for God's sake, it just feels so <i>wrong</i>!""<p>[1]: A strained extension of the term ""gubbins"" (<a href=""http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gubbins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/gubbins</a>) outside its usual meaning?

They tend to be statically and early bound to their properties and functions, and if they need to change jobs, they have to be recompiled, which is expensive. If you ask them to do something that they don't know how to do, they will probably try, though may fail spectacularly segfault style, taking the whole program down. Engineers are written in C++.<p>A graphic designer is a Person who may or may not have a Job, or may intermittently have something that fulfills the function of a Job without being a Job itself. They tend to be dynamically late bound to their properties and functions (just ask my wife, who does a lot of freelance and contract work). They are written in Ruby.<p>An Entrepreneur is a Person who may or may not have any number of properties or functions at any one time, and may or may not delegate work to some other party. They are written in Javascript.<p>Engineers tend to have very well defined ideas of what is public and private, whereas designers wear their heart more on their sleeve.

Second, new technology enables many startups to handle some services in-house, whereas before it required hiring an expensive service provider (e.g., Google AdWords). Third, there is a shift in mentality towards a leaner, smarter mode of starting up.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.""<p>But how likely is this language to be generally accepted?

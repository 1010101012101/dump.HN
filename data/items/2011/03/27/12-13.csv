Usually this improves the user experience, but sometimes it is done more for benchmarkship.<p>- They both heavily optimize for benchmarks.<p>- In one case, AMD crossed the lean and their optimization did not return identical results as non-optimized.<p>Whether or not AMD did this deliberately is up for debate.   If you've ever had to optimize something, you know how easy it is to screw up and return stale cache results or screw up in some other way.<p>Yes, AMD deserved to get slapped for their mistake, but I don't think one incidence is evidence of a culture any worse than NVidia's.",1301230708

2374865,comment,2374747,2374747,2,0,wccrawford,,,"I absolutely disagree.  I had given up on 'being perfect' for a while and decided to just live.  Everything in my life was a mess, especially my apartment.  Worst of all, my code quality could have used some serious improvement, but I'd given up striving to be the best I could be, so I didn't bother to find ways to improve, I just did the same old thing over and over.<p>And then the company hired a programmer that was fanatical about code quality.   It didn't take long to start learning better techniques from him and I started applying it to the rest of my life as well.  I now have a new job, new apartment, and I'm constantly improving myself.<p>Was I unhappy before?  Not really..  But I wasn't -happy-.  I was just existing.  Now, I enjoy improving things in my life every day.  Looking at the difference from day to day and month to month, I get a feeling of accomplishment.  I'm proud of the things I have and do, instead of merely existing.<p>So no, 'stop trying to be perfect' is not good advice to help someone be happy.  Instead, convince them to actually work to make their life better, and fix the things they -can- fix, instead of worrying about the things they can't.<p>I'm not a religious person, but this is one of the best quotes for self-improvement I've ever heard:<p>""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."" - Reinhold Niebuhr<p>Whether you are religious or not, you don't need God to give you those things.  You can get there on your own if you try.",1301230446

Errors and warnings are prefixed by their number in compiler output.<p>This makes it easy to know exactly what's being disabled, and what you need to type to disable any warning just by reading the compiler output.

This leaves you the people desperate enough for work that they're willing to put up with you.<p>If you approach the collaboration as if you were haggling with a car salesman for a better model, it won't matter whether you outsource or go local, capable people (who are generally in demand and can afford to decline clients, regardless of where they're based), will sense that you aren't worth the hassle and wait for something better.<p>The way to get good work done is to pay well, give clear directions about what you want, and most importantly, limit the goal to a core set of features that are realistically achievable in the proposed budget and timeframe. This is actually the cheapest and most reliable way to obtain something decent that works well in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Underpaying is much worse than overpaying. When you overpay, you can be more confident in the estimates you get and that the quality will be there, and the developers will be more motivated to do a good job for you (which can be critically important). Underpaying gets poor quality, will make the project take much longer if it even survives, AND the people responsible for your entire system will rush through it and might even have a grudge against you due to previously mentioned penny-pinching and feature crazy habits.<p>Summing up: aggressively seeking the most features for the lowest rate will paradoxically net you a poor result with a large bill.",1301229571

So: how much would this insurance cost?  Cleanup, health care costs, disability payments, loss of property?<p>Given just a slight increase in illness rate for the sheer number of people involved can give a hard to detect but significant cost.  An insurer will have to set aside enough money for the expected amount of payout.  What would Warren Buffett's premiums be?

They're basically being treated as a commodity, because typically the projects that go to such places do so because these projects are 'cost centres' - some business guy decided to get the 'i have an idea, the rest is implementation' part done as cheap (or ""cost-efficient"") as possible.<p>When the programming team has no engagement with the idea or the organisation or even the product they're contracted to build, why would they expend any creativity or initiative for it? Not everyone is personally driven by a sense of excellence, sometimes people just want to get the job done. And my experience in such places is that a lot of the programmers there aren't in it for the love of software/IT/tech, and more focussed on just getting a job done.",1301227869

Data is a tool, not a crutch.<p>If you write UI software, how do you know that you're getting better?  You can use A/B testing, sure; but how do you decide which metrics to use?  Ultimately, it comes down to taste: you look at one possible approach, you look at the other, you give them both an honest appraisal, and then you say ""I like the first version better.""<p>It's the same thing with writing.  Write a sentence.  Now rewrite it, removing superfluous words or changing the phrasing or breaking it in two.  Which one did you like better?  What's different about it?  That's how you improve.<p>As for their being no books - pish posh, there're plenty of books on improving your writing skills.  The <i>Elements of Fiction Writing</i> is one such series.  I've heard Steven King's <i>On Writing</i> is also quite good.

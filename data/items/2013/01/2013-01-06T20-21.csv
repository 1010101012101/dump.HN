Surely it's not normal or representative of the general population.

But we no longer use any of the built-in JavaScript->HTML functionality directly.<p>Which is sort of a shame because there's stuff in there that totally obviates the need to haphazardly traverse the dom with jQuery.<p>Finding the form an input element belongs to in jQuery:<p><pre><code>    $('input').parents('form');

    $('input').parent().parent().parent().find('form');

Finding the same thing using the DOM API:<p><pre><code>    document.querySelector('input').form;

You'd want to mix those two, in a real use case:<p><pre><code>    $('input').on('click', function(evt) {

(The X protocol is not particularly well-designed for lots of things.)<p>One of mosh's advantages is that it does screen rendering on the server, and then synchronizes the screen with the client. So, if there's been ten screenfuls of outputs, and those packets were lost or delayed or the connection couldn't keep up, the client only needs to receive what's currently on the screen. (This doesn't work in the other direction, but there's typically a lot less traffic in that direction.)<p>You can't quite do that with X, since the X protocol itself involves no way to get / diff / synchronize the contents of the screen -- it involves a bunch of rendering operations, so if there's a delay, it needs to re-send those operations.<p>Still, there's an open ticket:

This makes latency less of a factor, since the human operators can take their time in selecting targets, and are fairly confident that they won't face any sudden attacks.<p>As drone-on-drone combat becomes more common, you're definitely correct that more decisions will be made by the drones, without human intervention. I can imagine drones having a bedrock set of commands that don't require human approval (such as, ""if another aircraft is shooting at you, drop what you're doing and shoot back""). Humans would still provide overall goals, such as ""blow up that bunker"", but the drones will have increasing autonomy in how that is carried out.<p>There's an interesting parallel to the Mars rovers here, precisely because of the massive latency, even though Mars isn't an actively hostile environment. I don't recall the source, but I remember reading about Curiosity having much more autonomy than previous versions.

That reviewing decontextualized data is a poor way to synthesize most thing! But who would listen? I wouldn't have 4 years ago.<p>Good point. When I read about SRS for the first time a few weeks ago, I had roughly the same idea as the author of this article (except I didn't carry it out--a million kudos because he did :) ).<p>Now I think the difference with using SRS for learning a natural language is the ultimate goal: It's not ""I wanted to learn how to program in language X"", if I wanted to do that, I'd do some tutorials or try to complete some Project Euler challenges in that language. Instead, it's ""I want to spend less time having to look up parameters and usage of functions in language X's standard library, a language I am already quite familiar with, apart from spending too much time reading the documentation"".<p>Now that I think about it, I see another <i>great</i> advantage: It's a personal thing, I don't expect most people to battle with this problem as much as I do, but whenever I need to look up something in the docs, the problem is not only that this takes time, but also that I have the tendency to read way <i>more</i> of the docs than what is relevant to the problem at hand, I click through to other pages that seem interesting, which reference an external site, I look up stuff related to that and get <i>completely</i> sidetracked. Not only does this take an extraordinary amount of time, but also drains mental energy that I should be using to work on the initial programming problem. This lack of focus has gotten so bad that it resulted in severe burn-out and I've basically resigned myself to not pursuing a career in computer programming related jobs, even though that's what I love to do.<p>Not having to look up things, so I do not need to task-switch (as much) and keep focused on the programming, well I tried so many other things, I really must give this a shot.<p>When I read about SRS, there were a couple of programs available, is Anki generally considered to be the best (free) one to start with?",1357503785

It doesn't actually look like you are using the NS prefix in any of your code, so you're not technically violating the below rule, but I still think it worth considering. NS kindof means ""from apple"".<p>""Objective-C classes must be named uniquely not only within the code that youre writing in a project, but also across any frameworks or bundles you might be including. As an example, you should avoid using generic class names like ViewController or TextParser because its possible a framework you include in your app may fail to follow conventions and create classes with the same names.<p>In order to keep class names unique, the convention is to use prefixes on all classes. Youll have noticed that Cocoa and Cocoa Touch class names typically start either with NS or UI. Two-letter prefixes like these are reserved by Apple for use in framework classes...<p>Your own classes should use three letter prefixes. These might relate to a combination of your company name and your app name, or even a specific component within your app. As an example, if your company were called Whispering Oak, and you were developing a game called Zebra Surprise, you might choose WZS or WOZ as your class prefix.""<p><a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Conventions/Conventions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/cocoa/...</a><p>In practice many people use two letter prefixes for their classes, you should use a prefix with your classes!<p>The project looks great, I've been wishing for a more comprehensive logging system with filtering built in for a while now.

Around age 35-40, if you work 80-hour weeks and don't make any mistakes, the prize is <i>getting a job that you can't be fired from</i>. Meanwhile, the same kind of exertion (and political luck) in finance or software will have you able to retire: not in luxury, but at a middle-class standard of living that could be described as ""making your own tenure"". Also, you get to live where you want, instead of rolling the dice on where in the country you will end up living.<p>It's billed as ""the life of the mind"", but the reality is that a lot of the work is mindnumbingly boring: writing grant applications, grading papers, attending committees. Every industry has some boring work and vicious politics, but most industries are honest about it. In software, having been fired once because of political bullshit is par for the course. Yep, that happens. In academia, getting shot down for tenure is this huge mark of shame.<p>Finally, the academic industry has a <i>huge</i> underclass of people who spend lots of time between adjunct gigs on teaching work that is viewed as a commodity and paid extremely poorly.<p>I'm sorry, but this industry has sold out a generation and a half, while tuitions have shot toward the moon, and that's fucking inexcusable. University leadership: stop building fucking ziggurats and colossuses and get fund some goddamn research and teaching. In other words, do your job.",1357502483

The exact details of how you work it out, how you structure the company and how you involve lawyers are up to you.<p>Generally, I think you should avoid founding companies with people you think are going to rip you off.

I see a lot of traps and temptations that get in peoples' way. <p>But we should remember that in some sense we must all individually self-define what ""success"" is. I just don't buy the rat-race-up-the-mountain metaphor. Life is more about tradeoffs and operating near to your potential. And in pursuing idealistic goals.",1197738832

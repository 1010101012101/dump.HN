The general principles Beane operated from have pretty much been adopted league-wide at this point.  Of course, MLB is a zero-sum game, so once everyone adopts something, it's no longer an advantage.  The Tampa Bay Rays are operating off the same statistical measurement philosophy (although they understandably don't share which) to make a small-market club operate efficiently, and they're pretty successful with it.",1273843627

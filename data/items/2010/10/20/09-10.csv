1810601,comment,1809618,1810513,0,0,snotrockets,,,"You've got more than a Kernel, which was already open, as Android is based on the Linux kernel.<p>It's interesting that it isn't a common unix or GNU. The whole software stack up from the kernel is different to anything you see elsewhere (I understand that MeeGo, another Linux-based phone OS takes a more standard approach, thus it be more comfortable to hack on, once it stops being vaporware).<p>But AOSP does host code for the whole middleware and a couple of applications. What is missing in AOSP are some userspace drivers, the code that runs on the radio hardware (""baseband"" in iPhone speak), and the Google services and brand.<p>To continue your OS X analogy, it'd be like getting code for the whole OS, except for the stuff in /Applications.<p>The problem with Android is that this software is useless if you don't have hardware to run it. And unlike a computer, where I can go to the store, buy a PC, download a Linux distro and run it on that hardware, most phones are tivoized and won't let you run software not signed by the manufacture.\nSo you need to buy a special dev phone (N1 included), pull the binary drivers from the installed firmware, build AOSP from source, and flash it to the phone. And then you'd be missing the Google-candy. You can also get OpenMoko, which I think have all its drivers open.<p>But I guess most people don't want to compile software for their own phone, just like only a few people build their OS from source. Most even never bother installing an OS, just using what came pre-installed. The hate against Android phones is from users wanting timely software upgrades, and no carrier-mandated crap. That, I'm happy to say, is mostly an American problem. Carriers sell phones the world round, but outside the US, caring customers (which are still a minority -- HN readers to the contrary, not everybody cares about what software her phone has), buy handsets from a 3rd party, and those have less limiting crap installed, as they need to satisfy the costumer, not the carrier.",1287568525

1810564,comment,1810119,1810119,0,0,Mz,,,"(Warning:  I have hardly slept.  A family member is dying.  I will likely regret this post.  It seemed like a good idea at the time -- or at least a better idea than wallowing in self pity.)<p>Do I think I am a genius?  No.  But I have been repeatedly told that I ""stand out"" from the crowd even when the crowd is pretty bright (which usually feels to me like I stick out like a sore thumb :-/ ).  Do I think in a way that is different from the average person? Absolutely -- I think this is clear by the rampant degree to which I am routinely misunderstood and the fact that I and my son are getting well when doctors and most of the world say it cannot be done.<p>Is this 'miracle cure' due to genius?  I don't happen to think so.  It is mostly due to a unique set of circumstances and my ability to recognize the opportunity it represented, combined with a fairly high degree of social insight which allowed me to side step group-think and other social traps.  I have a relatively mild form of a condition that is quite deadly, and so does my oldest son.  I was diagnosed late in life, not long before the age at which most people die from the more traditionally recognized form of the condition. The late diagnosis meant that I had been thinking about my health issues and coping with them for a very long time before being given a label for it.  So when that label came, I was reluctant to accept the definitions, assumptions, preconceived notions, psychological baggage and raft of general mental and emotional crapola that such labels typically come with.<p>I am also a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.  The journey of recovery for that issue prepared me for asking the hard, socially unacceptable questions that were needed for me to get well, first psychologically and later physically.  (After spending years telling a couple of different therapists, who also happened to be ministers, every dirty thing ever done to me and every nasty thing I ever felt, the negative reactions that swirl around my shocking views of health issues are hardly worth raising an eyebrow over.)  At the age of 45, I am at a place where I feel that this earlier psychological journey of healing was a gift to me -- a unique and highly valuable opportunity for thinking through problems which are ""unthinkable"" and ""unspeakable"" but which I had no choice but to think on and speak on in order to survive (I attempted suicide at age 17 and would likely have self-destructed in some manner if I had not dealt with these issues).<p>I was also a homemaker for a long time in an era and culture where that is very strange and I homeschooled my twice exceptional (gifted and learning disabled) sons.  I think every single thing I have done has reinforced my ability to walk my own path and resist following the crowd in spite of often enormous pressure from one crowd or another.  Not getting sucked into group-think is the most valuable skill I have and probably the most offensive thing I do, socially.  Einstein said something like ""You cannot solve a problem from the same level of consciousness that created it.""  It is clear to me that the definitions and view of the health problem I have are part of the problem.  In some ways, I find it baffling that my attempts to share a different view are so shocking and offensive to other people -- people who clearly know that the status quo is not working yet cling to the thinking of the status quo like a security blanket.  I don't know how to help such people and attempting to do so puts me in a position of being a target of ugliness.  I don't believe martyring myself is any way to put more good into the world. I believe it only teaches people that ""good"" people must martyr themselves and anyone who doesn't is ""bad"", or something along those lines.  The general tendency for people to force individuals into roles of ""good"" or ""bad"" is the root of many problems.  I would rather walk away entirely than contribute to reinforcement of this paradigm.  I often wonder if I should, in a sense, go into ""hiding"" -- stop posting under any names I am known by online and start some new website that no one would expect and go live the ""normal life"" I desperately wanted for so long and am now getting well enough to try to pursue.<p>I don't have an answer to that last conundrum, perhaps more proof positive that I am not a genius.  Sometimes, knowing the right questions to ask is more important than having an answer.  That approach has taken me pretty far, so I see no reason to abandon it at this late stage in the game.<p>""Be careful what you wish for"".  Had you asked this question on some other day, I likely would not have replied. :-P But there is a tiny piece of my own inner monologue, FWIW.",1287567422

This means that in addition to enabling users to see inside a production Java (also JRuby) application deployed in a cloud or in a datacenter, users are free to monitor these processes from anywhere at any time.<p>Said Monitis Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan, “This is a big deal.  This is a major step forward in the industry and we are excited to be at the forefront of this innovation.  With this new addition Monitis becomes a true Swiss army knife for the IT administrators.  Our host of useful tools in one simple, easy-to-use package can be configured in 5 minutes and require zero maintenance efforts.”<p>Monitis’ Cloud-based Application Monitoring Tool provides monitoring, troubleshooting, root cause diagnosis, plus pro-active planning tools such as load generators, scalability analysis, resource usage analysis and more.  Specifically, the Java Applicaton Monitoring tool:\n•	Monitors every metric, log, and configuration for all JMX resources in your inventory\n•	Identifies problem resources\n•	Controls all JMX resources on-demand\n•	Sends alerts on any measurement, log, or security event in your JMX environment\n•	Integrates fully into Monitis’ award-winning internal and external monitoring suite.<p>Specific metrics for the Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring Tool include:\n•	General Server Metrics\no	Availability and Uptime\no	Object metrics\no	Heap Memory Used, Committed and Max\no	Loaded and Unloaded Classes\no	Thread Count\n•	JVM Garbage Collector Metrics\n•	JVM Memory Pool Metrics<p>Monitis’ Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring Tool can monitor all leading commercial and open source J2EE application servers.  The servers which provide JMX capabilities for monitoring include all leading products like: WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Apache Geronimo, JRun, Tomcat, Glassfish, and Resin. Monitis monitoring of Sun Java System could also be done through the SNMP mechanism used by the administrative console of the web server.<p>As with all Monitis tools, the new Cloud-based Java Application Monitoring tool is designed to save IT managers massive amounts of time.  Sign-up and set-up take less than 5 minutes, and with Monitis’ heralded, hyper-intuitive interface, there is no learning curve – an incredible claim given that Monitis is perhaps the most powerful application performance management tool available today. Its pay as you go model makes the procurement easy even for Universities, which may also benefit from academic pricing.<p>Last but not least, Monitis is making the remote JMX probe agent open source, creating unlimited space open for IT managers and system administrators to gain confidence by extending the tool and creating customized checks.<p>Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a Java technology that provides the tools for building distributed, Web-based, modular and dynamic solutions for managing and monitoring devices, applications, and service-driven networks.<p>About Monitis All-in-One Monitoring Platform\nMonitis is the only service that provides Cloud Monitoring from the Cloud.

I think marketing it with the cell phone alternative angle would be genius and would really sell units. The device is fairly priced, mostly spot on feature-wise. It lacks GPS support, though, and would be much better as a smartphone alternative with it.<p>Is there anything stopping archos or any other company from doing something like this and marketing it as an alternative to the traditional cellphone?\nPlease use your industry connections and whatnot to get this message to higher places and make this a reality.

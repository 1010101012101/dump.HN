It is taking advantage of a feature provided by a multi billion dollar company who hasn't realized that it can make huge sum of money by making it a paid feature or limiting its use. I have signed a contract with the company and the contract is currently has no regulations on what I am doing, but I am afraid that the company will change the contract as soon as it realizes that I am using the system. What kind of legal protection I should try to obtain? I cannot share the idea with anyone unless I have fully implemented it? I am an owner of a small startup and am afraid that I might get screwed over. I just want to make sure that whatever I have done before the company changes it policy remains mine as mentioned in the contract. Any suggestions?",1244688985

652205,comment,651841,652150,0,0,Devilboy,,,"What Kurzweil is saying is that you can't just linearly extrapolate the progress of these projects. Even if we only know a fraction of a percentage of what's going on in the brain after 20 years doesn't mean we'll know only twice as much in another 20 years. Rather we're likely to see the pace accelerate. Going from 50% to 100% might take less time than going from 1% to 2% knowledge.<p>Keep in mind that he's been making predictions like these for decades and he's got a pretty good track record.",1244688849

And, I often tell them that they aren't being given enough information, so they should ask me relevant questions.  Am I The Google?<p>In contrast, if I see a resume with a few years of experience writing Java code (working full-time on 90%+ Java systems), then I think it's reasonable to discuss the specifics of the language/platform.  If you've supposedly been writing Java code for a few years and you can't tell me how exceptions work, then you're a moron or a liar.",1244688822

652201,comment,651879,652070,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Okay, my experience is limited to one big company, but I found I rarely need to ask permission to do anything but launch.  And that's only because launching instantly means more people will be using my product than most startups get in their lifetime.  I'm perfectly free to build stuff, show it to friends (as long as the friends work within the company), improve it, make my own design calls, etc.<p>In fact, I'm encouraged to do so.  When I joined, my boss said ""If you see something that's broken, just go fix it and mail off a codereview"".  He's since told me ""If you have an idea, just go ahead and implement it, don't even ask my permission.""  And when I've done so, the reaction has generally been quite positive - I got a free phone out of it, after all.",1244688149

652198,comment,651586,651586,0,0,zacharypinter,,,"I've heard a lot of back and forth about subsidized pricing and how this is standard procedure for phone companies.<p>The problem here is that Apple is a company that drives its customers to constantly buy the latest gadget. Cell phone subsidies make the early adopters feel like they're getting shafted, as they are not eligible for the advertised price.<p>The real solution here is to only subsidize the ""average consumer"" version of the device, or to avoid subsidy programs that are significantly longer than the time span between different versions of the device. A 2 year subsidy makes no sense if Apple is producing a new phone in less than a year.",1244687573
652197,comment,652118,652118,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"OK, so this isn't related to your blog post, but I clicked over to MixPanel, and checked out pricing.  Is my math wrong, or would your pricing mean that I'd be paying $126.50 per <i>month</i> for just one of my sites (with 160k monthly pageviews)?  That's even more than hosting the site costs.  Seems a little steep, unless I'm not your target audience?  It kinda seems like my kind of site would be exactly your audience, as we are a site that sells things, and doesn't trade on high traffic and so the funnel definitely matters to us.",1244687451

100ms doesn't seem at all enough to have that big an impact.  (especially for something like amazon - where there is likely some level of intent and definate trust that the site is valuable).  I just can't see how a .1sec delay could affect so many sales?",1244687297

In the micro world it's not like that - the protons and neutrons combine into a single mixed jumble.<p>So that's what's special about it, despite it being unstable: at least for a time it was a single particle.<p>Instability is all about energy, if you release energy by splitting off a particle, it will do so. Guaranteed. If you need energy to do so, it won't. The time it takes to decay is directly proportional to the amount of energy released.<p>(Another thing that can cause stability is conservation of quantum number like charge and momentum. If it's illegal for a piece to split off, then even if there is a lot of energy, it won't.)<p>But instability does not imply the atom is somehow less of an atom than another one. It's just an atom at a very high energy level.",1244685692

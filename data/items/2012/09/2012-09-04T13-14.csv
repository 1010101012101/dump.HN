I'm not going to believe any claims that it's worse today than in the past without evidence. It's certainly not self evident.<p>Do you have any better examples than school children? You can't really compare the force behaviour of oppressed children who are scared of being tortured, to the behaviour of children today in schools today.

4474518,comment,4473833,4474143,9,0,slowpoke,,,"<i>>The number of stopped terror attacks in the West over the last decade is
quite large</i><p>Bull. Fucking. Crap.<p>For example, according to this[1] source, there have been not even 50 terror
attacks against America in the <i>last 90 years</i>. And while the amount seems to
have increased recently, this <i>surely</i> has <i>absolutely nothing</i> to do with the US
playing world police and giving more and more people reasons to hate them (not
that this excuses terror attacks, but you get the point).<p>This whole bullshit is a gigantic pile of FUD and propaganda. There <i>is no
terror threat</i>. There never has been any. At least not more than randomly
getting shot on the street or dying in a car crash caused by a drunk driver. I
don't see people pushing for universal surveillance of the blood alcohol of all
drivers or some other nonsense.<p>The whole thing is so fucktardedly ridiculous that the FBI regularly <i>invents</i>
terror suspects[2], and arrests them ""last minute"" to then claim it has ""once again
eliminated a threat to national security"". Everything's fair game to continue
their bullshit pushes for more surveillance and less civil liberty. And what's
even more enraging: people like you <i>buy it</i>.<p>Conclusion: No, we don't need surveillance. No, we don't need fed agencies
spying on everyone and everything and no one to keep them in check (who watches
the watchmen?). No, we don't need bullshit laws that further and further
infringe on every human's civil liberties and human rights for no reason but

4474513,comment,4472897,4473978,2,0,robomartin,,,"The accusation is that Apple INTENTIONALLY gave the FBI a database with twelve million records.  That is what my comment refers to.  It is preposterous to propose that Apple --or any company for that matter-- would willingly do that.  The liability hole this would open up would be massive.  They are a business and you can bet your ass that every decision with potential liability consequences is well considered by managers and their legal teams.<p>No, I am not an Apple fanboy, quite the contrary.  As a developer I am very critical of their attitude and decision making.  I think they really suck at some things and have been very vocal about it on HN and elsewhere.  That does not mean that I would automatically vilify them for everything.<p>HN is very interesting at times.  Most of the time you get positive feedback when you are for Apple and for politically Liberal points of view.  However, sometimes the poles reverse and North becomes South.  This is rare when Apple is the subject.  I guess in this case it was as simple as not understanding what the comment was referring to, which can happen if someone doesn't actually read the original article in the first place.",1346767046

4474505,comment,4471030,4471030,1,0,abhishekdesai,,,"I wrote a post on this long time back in 2009. Built a company from 4 people to more than 60 developers based on some of the fundamentals mentioned in the post. Pasting it here.<p>--------------------------------------------<p>With my three friends I am running an IT service company for more than 5 years now. We have learned things the long and hard way during all these years. There was actually no single person to guide us regarding any aspect of the IT business though we have had many well wishers so far.<p>So to help entrepreneurs who are also planning to start their own company or who have just started the company I am planning to write series of articles which can help them in this journey. So here is the first one for you guys.<p>During these 5 years we have faced many challenges technically as well as in managing projects, clients and people. But one of the most challenging part of our business right now is scaling. We plan to double the revenue and increase the profitability without increasing head count considerably. We have around 70 people team right now and we plan to maintain the same. So now one of the challenges is to get quality projects from which you can earn more.<p>Following are few ways using which you can fetch software development projects from the market:<p>1) Contacts. Contacts. Contacts. Exhaust all your contacts for fetching the first project for your company. Do it for free if needed. You have to have experience to fetch some serious work. In your initial stage, contacts are the best thing you can have. This is perhaps the best time to use your family contacts and relatives.<p>2)  If you are couple of years old company, make a list of all old clients and send them personalized mail saying if we can be of any other help.<p>3) Join the bidding site such as oDesk and Elance and start building a great profile. oDesk is my favorite site for getting new work as it has a unique model which makes a win-win situation for both buyers and providers. The other best thing about it is that you mostly get hourly projects over there and weekly payments. Payment for your work is guaranteed. Elance is good for bigger size fixed projects. There are many other bidding sites such as Guru, Rent-A-Coder etc but these two are my favorites.<p>4) Become a Microsoft Partner and access their database of companies. Email them, call them for building relationship.<p>5) Get your company or yourself registered on Facebook and Twitter. Use their search functionality to find out what people are looking for.<p>6) If you have little extra money try Google Adwords for keywords like ""hire a programmer"", ""companies in india"", ""outsourcing"" etc<p>7) Get it from most popular classified site craigslist.org<p>8) Tie up with local partners who can outsource you projects.<p>9) If you are a new company start developing on the latest technologies. For e.g. Developing iPhone Applications will get you far more projects than developing in PHP or .NET right now.<p>These are just the few ways and there can be many other ways to fetch software development projects. Please leave me a comment if you have  other ways of fetching the projects. We all will be happy to know.<p>--------------------------------------------<p>Original post:

Something like introducing the forward pass to football. Is it wrong for another team to copy that strategy? What if the only other team that can win is the one team that most shamelessly copied that strategy? At some point you have to start thinking that the problem is with the (losing) teams that arent copying. """,1346764497
4474381,comment,4474166,4474359,4,0,f4stjack,,,"Well, that was what I gathered from the part I'll about to quote. But considering English is not my native language I might have misunderstood his meaning:<p>""As explained in the book, this table is reproduced from an earlier publication:<p><pre><code>    Table 1.1, reproduced from Code Complete, 2nd Edition, by Steve McConnell (Microsoft Press, 2004), shows the results of a survey that evaluated the cost of fixing a bug as a function of the time it lay dormant in the product. The table shows that fixing bugs at the end of a project is the most expensive way to work, which makes sense
</code></pre>
The first mistake I made was simply that I seem to have made up the bit about it being the result of a survey. I dont know where I got that from. In McConnell, its titled Average Cost of Fixing Defects Based on When Theyre Introduced and Detected (Table 3-1, at the top of page 30). Its introduced in a paragraph marked HARD DATA, and is accompanied by an impressive list of references in the table footer. McConnell:<p><pre><code>    The data in Table 3-1 shows that, for example, an architecture defect that costs $1000 to fix when the architecture is being created can cost $15,000 to fix during system test.
</code></pre>
As already covered, the first problem is that I misattributed the data in the table. The second problem, and the one that in my opinion Ive let down my readers the most by not catching, is that the table is completely false.""",1346764489

The data underlying that book was gathered from projects at IBM in the '60s and '70s and I don't really doubt that the underlying data was fairly represented.<p>The bigger question is whether improvements in processes and tools have obsoleted this data.  TDD and automated regression testing would be one place where inter-phase defects could become less costly.  On the other hand, projects that have uncorrected architectural errors can be completely functional and yet their maintenance costs never decrease.<p>If someone has a copy handy, please validate my memory otherwise I'll check when I get home this evening.",1346764467

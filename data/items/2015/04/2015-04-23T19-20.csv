9429387,comment,9428403,9428403,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"I&#x27;ve been in Guatemala off and on for over 17 years[0]. My parents came down later and started a free medical clinic.<p>Healthcare for &quot;Indians&quot; here is often terrible[1]. There&#x27;s tons of discrimination, and &quot;indian&quot; is often used as an insult (&quot;que indio!&quot;). There&#x27;s a feedback loop, because the people distrust hospitals and thus go less since &quot;people die there&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s further compounded by local villager beliefs. My mom has several stories of kids dying, literally because their parents insisted on having a priest do something first, delaying critical care by hours. Or not treating things and losing a leg or more because of a simple cut. Stuff that we might take as basic, obvious things, are simply not.<p>Oh, and medicine compliance is extra difficult when the patients can&#x27;t read and have relatives telling the patient that medicine is an evil trick.<p>Even giving out birth control faces opposition. Apparently a lot of the men think if their wife doesn&#x27;t get pregnant every so often, she must be seeing another man on the side. Often women desperately don&#x27;t want to have more kids, but &quot;must&quot;. (And mix in a high infant mortality rate, and sometimes women won&#x27;t even name the child for a while after birth to avoid attachment. Pretty fucked up.)<p>I&#x27;m alternately amazed and repulsed regarding the people that work and try to fix this. It&#x27;s an unending stream of fucked-up-ness. My parents&#x27; clinic sees 50-70 people a day (3 days a week), and that&#x27;s just from 3 small villages. Sure, it&#x27;s great that they save people and no doubt that&#x27;s what motivates them. But I step back and look at the overall horror and the constant onslaught -- it seems so hopeless without real large scale efforts. (Which really, probably translate to having another country come in and run things.) I just don&#x27;t know how people deal with this - I certainly cannot face it.<p>Finally, keep in mind that overall, Guatemala is a rather messed up country with too much violence and incompetence. Healthcare is just one aspect. When there&#x27;s essentially zero police response, things tend to go downhill quickly. Anyone can get away with anything, so long they aren&#x27;t stopped in the act. (Hence every place, down to McDonalds, has &quot;guards&quot; with shotguns.)<p>0: I visited when I was 15 and realised I could drink all I wanted without being carded and it was cheap, so I dropped out and moved down. Ended up staying a bit too long.<p>1: Well healthcare in Guatemala is pretty shitty overall, even if you&#x27;re paying and trying to find decent doctors. Bad education or just straight-out fraud (insisting on unnecessary surgeries, for the money). Some things, if done in the US or proper countries, would be viewed as outright criminal, beyond negligence.",1429818936

Of course, to offset the cost of 4 years of school and 4 &quot;lost&quot; years of productivity, students want degrees that will improve their odds of getting a job. That pretty much explains the shift towards professional training.<p>Bringing the universities to everyone also means broadening the offerings — originally when it was only the erudition-inclined or well-to-do, a university could get away with having a great deal of humanities and other fields that do not generate grants or jobs.

(It&#x27;s also quite possible that I&#x27;m just misunderstanding the whole thing.)<p>But it&#x27;s pretty easy to see where the real problem is. I recently spent a few days trying to figure out how I could configure SSH to connect to one machine via a different machine. (This effort was a total failure.) I read the ssh_config man page. Here&#x27;s the entry for ProxyCommand, which is apparently how you do this:<p><pre><code>    ProxyCommand
      Specifies the command to use to connect to the server.  The com-
      mand string extends to the end of the line, and is executed using
      the user&#x27;s shell `exec&#x27; directive to avoid a lingering shell
      process.

      In the command string, any occurrence of `%h&#x27; will be substituted
      by the host name to connect, `%p&#x27; by the port, and `%r&#x27; by the
      remote user name.  The command can be basically anything, and
      should read from its standard input and write to its standard
      output.  It should eventually connect an sshd(8) server running
      on some machine, or execute sshd -i somewhere.  Host key manage-
      ment will be done using the HostName of the host being connected
      (defaulting to the name typed by the user).  Setting the command
      to ``none&#x27;&#x27; disables this option entirely.  Note that CheckHostIP
      is not available for connects with a proxy command.

      This directive is useful in conjunction with nc(1) and its proxy
      support.  For example, the following directive would connect via
      an HTTP proxy at 192.0.2.0:

         ProxyCommand /usr/bin/nc -X connect -x 192.0.2.0:8080 %h %p
</code></pre>
I think it&#x27;s fair to say that this is completely incomprehensible. I&#x27;ve read it several times; I still can&#x27;t say I understand any part of it (all right, I understand the bit about %h, %p, and %r substitutions). It doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that nobody uses ProxyCommand -- how are they supposed to know what it does, or how it&#x27;s used?<p>I might also note that this &quot;correct&quot; solution involves telling ssh to execute the nc command on the middle machine, which is a weird bit of arcana to add to the process and makes it much harder to intuit independently. Ideally, I&#x27;d hope for a solution that lets me just supply credentials and information for the middle machine, and let ssh sort out how to get through it.",1429817818

Something like the members of the monastery signing an agreement that they are ok with their results being published with one year delay, time that would give an edge to the monastery over any competitors that would also want to develop products based on them - think of it like a &quot;research monastery self-financed by coupling with a sort of startup incubator&quot; (with some really intransigent and incorruptible people working to keep the two camps of people apart and to stop the &quot;business idea developers&quot; from exploiting the &quot;monks&quot;).<p>And for research fields that require some expensive equipment, like bio-medical research, the &quot;monastery&quot; may make the &quot;monks&quot; sign contracts giving the patents and other right to their discoveries to the monastery, in exchange for having access to a lab where they can work on anything they want. It&#x27;s not that utopic since you can a pretty usable top notch molecular biology lab plus an animal experiments facility for under $1M (probably not in the US because you have too many regulations and stuff...) if you find alternative channels of buying equipment of user other &quot;hacks&quot; that regular research institutes can&#x27;t use...<p>But it&#x27;s the kind of idea that it&#x27;s hard to convince other people it would make sense... so for now I&#x27;ll keep it on my list of to-dos for after I get filthy rich so I can finance this myself.",1429817416

A language — whether human or computer — isn&#x27;t just about the algorithms it can express, but about the ways it lets you express them, understand them and combine them.

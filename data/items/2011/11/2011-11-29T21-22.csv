3292379,comment,3289839,3289839,1,0,hwiechers,,,"I finally understand it.<p>Here are my events (taking 2 children as given):<p><pre><code>  B = I have a boy
  BT = I have a boy and he was born on Tuesday
  2B = I have 2 boys
  B+G = I have a boy and a firl
</code></pre>
Using Bayes' Theorem:<p><pre><code>  Pr(2B|BT) = Pr(BT|2B)Pr(2B)/c
  Pr(B+G|BT) = Pr(BT|B+G)Pr(B+G)/c
  where c = Pr(2B|BT) + Pr(B+G|BT)

  Pr(BT|2B) = 1/7 + 1/7 - 1/49 = 13/49
  Pr(2B) = 1/4
  Pr(BT|B+G) = 1/7
  PR(B+G) = 1/2
</code></pre>
So<p><pre><code>  c = 13/49 * 1/4 + 1/7 * 1/2 = 27/49
  Pr(2B|BT and 2C) = (13/49 * 1/4) / (27/49) = 13/27
  Pr(B+G| BT and 2C) = (1/7 * 1/2) / (27/49) = 14/27
</code></pre>
They main reason Pr(2B|BT) is around 50% is that 
Pr(2B|BT) is proportional to Pr(BT|2B) while
Pr(B+G|BT) is proportional to Pr(BT|B+G) and
Pr(BT|2B) is about 2 * Pr(BT|B+G).<p>It's much more likely you have a boy born on Tuesday given
that you have 2 boys (rather than you have a girl and a boy)
so it's more likely that you have 2 boys given that

    3. Profit.
</code></pre>
Unlike the usual case, here ??? actually has a value:<p><pre><code>    ??? = Save massively on labor costs vs. your competitors.
</code></pre>
As other companies discover the same strategy, demand increases for a fixed supply, thereby bidding up the equilibrium wage and hence dramatically improving the negotiating position of women. (Nothing improves the results of your negotiation faster than a better negotiating position.) In a competitive market for labor, the equilibrium is for everyone to be paid based on their productivity and their risk profile. Whether the latter factor favors women or men isn't <i>a priori</i> obvious; for example, men are more likely to die in a fight or a car accident, whereas women are more likely to take time off to have kids (and so on).<p>Unfortunately, market interventions typically have the opposite of their intended effect. Rules that punish companies for paying women less than men increase the risk of hiring women; rules that punish companies for not hiring enough women increase the risk of interviewing women; rules that punish not interviewing enough women increase the risk of recruiting women. All of these factors, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, lower the wages of women. (Those who depend on the gender rage industry, on the other hand, make off like bandits.)",1322601914

This is not enough to guarantee a free implementation, however Microsoft issued a statement under the Community Promise that these standards are worry-free of patents as long as the implementation implements the whole standard (which is quite light and contrary to Java, supersets are allowed).<p>What can be attacked are implementations of components, like ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Windows.Forms and maybe Silverlight. However, this would be a hard thing to do, simply because Microsoft ended up cooperating with the Mono team on at least the implementation of Silverlight. And also they actively encouraged Mono by other things, like referring to Mono in their official docs, which means Estoppel applies: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estoppel</a><p>So quite the contrary, I think Mono is even safer than Java, as Java is not governed by a real standards body and you can't implement Java unless Oracle allows you to (hence Harmony is dead). Even forking OpenJDK may be problematic, as the implicit patents grant may not apply to derivate works (at least in Europe).",1322601008

3292174,comment,3288671,3288671,40,0,grellas,,,"""Those who work hard make good"" is a profoundly American theme that dates back to Horatio Alger and before - it can hardly be said to originate from a cabal of VCs trying to ""put one over"" on hapless founders and startup employees in Silicon Valley. No doubt Mr. Arrington adds his peculiarly abrasive touch to the debate (toughen up, don't whine, and let's applaud Zynga for what it did to its employees), but he did something very similar not too long ago in chiding investors who were whining about being in the ""middle of a terrible blubble"" (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/were-in-the-middle-of-a-terrible-blubble/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/24/were-in-the-middle-of-a-ter...</a>). Like it or not, this is his philosophy and outlook about what it takes to play the startup game. It is his expression of ideas and social commentary. One can disagree with it as much as one likes but it <i>is</i> unfair to say that this is nothing more than a con job. It is also unfair to take him to task for quoting from a publicly available source to support his idea of what the experiences of startup employees have been like in Silicon Valley - if the goal is to illustrate such experiences, then what better source to use than a diary whose purpose was precisely to document them. If the author of that diary wants to say, ""no, that's not what I meant"" in response, that is fine but that doesn't justify an <i>ad hominem</i> attack on the person using it to illustrate ideas he wants to espouse.<p>My point here is strictly about fair argumentation, not about the merits of the debate. Whether right or wrong on the merits, I think the author takes an unfair shot in the way he makes his points here. We all have ideas and core beliefs, even those who are VCs. We all should be free to express them without being accused of nefarious motives.",1322600785

I've never once had success teaching people that words like 'deserve' and 'fair' have nothing to do with pricing a transaction.<p>So I divide it into two sides: negotiating to get more that what you 'deserve' (which they can categorize as unfair/wrong/evil etc..) and negotiating to get exactly what you deserve.

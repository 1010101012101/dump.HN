104272,comment,104063,104249,0,0,edw519,,,"Do you really think ""faster"" is what's most important?<p>In any of these cases, we're in core, where measurements are made in nanoseconds.  So it just doesn't matter.  Anyone trying to squeeze a few nanoseconds out of anything is wasting their time.<p>Now let me tell you what DOES matter.  Ready?<p>My back of the envelope solution is 15% as much code as the original.  To do the same thing.  THAT is a big frickin' deal.<p>If you've ever spent time building, deploying, enhancing, and maintaining anything of substance, then you already know that, right?<p>Never said the original programmer was a successful founder.  I said he was a retired millionaire.  Not hard to do after 40 years in this industry.  Or in his case, 1 year's experience 40 times.<p>I'm fixing bad code because there is a stunning demand to do so now.  Because of guys like the original programmer.  Which is great.  Because it demonstrates the demand for the startup I'm developing.<p>By the way, I don't decide what is interesting discussion here.  The whole group does.  Apparently, someone other than you thinks that what I have to say is interesting.",1201287407
104271,comment,103495,103562,0,0,dreish,,,"> Some straight men are celibate. They still get called ""heterosexual"", though. Straight men who are not celibate are not called ""men who have sex with women"" (MSW?).<p>In fact, they are.  Straight men who _are_ celibate would not be called MSW, and would not be at risk of contracting an STD.  Did you bother to think this through before popping off about the use of what turns out to be the correct terminology?",1201287401

The company's success is important to me for multiple reasons but I don't have nearly as much at stake as the founders do.  Their opinion is that there are lots of things we have to ""own"" and so I currently spend a lot of time creating new technical things.  I don't think this is the best way but I don't question it too seriously.  Right now I'm more motivated by flexibility.<p>That said, when I get around to doing <i>my</i> own startup I plan to create as few new technical things as I possibly can until it is safely out of the startup phase.  To me creating new technology is more often than not a huge risk which you only want to do when you <i>know</i> the reward is worthwhile.",1201286795

It's better to have a distributed way of doing things.

Then once you've pulled their data off, you process it offline and do whatever you need to do with the data.

Uh, 2 cars \n  breaking down is not considered a single point of failure.\n</code></pre>\nI'm afraid you might have spectacularly misunderstood my point.<p>The way Cloudflare operates is more closely related to a scenario where either one of the two cars failing brings down the site: that would be either the webserver or the CF infrastructure. Mathematically, the combined downtime of both <i>must</i> be greater than that of either one alone.<p><pre><code>  Tell me where the 100% uptime of the single image fails in that scenario.\n</code></pre>\nThere is no question that a CDN is generally designed to add robustness and speed to content delivery. But as you said, not all CDNs are created equal. I say this as a (satisfied) Cloudflare user myself:<p>In its default configuration, a basic Cloudflare plan has (almost) no settings. It's not like you make a choice e.g. to host only images there. Using the standard CF plan comes with basically two states your site can be in: either CF is on or it's off. When it's on, the entire traffic of that site is going through Cloudflare, they become your site's front-facing servers. There are some huge advantages to this, for example they block a lot of malicious traffic that way.<p>Coming back to your image example: individual components of the service may be designed for redundancy, but there is still a lot of stuff that can (and does) go wrong with global repercussions, if only for the simple reason that the CDN service as a whole must be centrally controlled.<p>If your webserver is up but CF is down, your site is down. If CF is up but your webserver is down, your site is down (actually it becomes a mirror of some static content for a few minutes before it goes offline completely). This is what I meant by each one of those services being a single point of failure, there is really no way of getting around that fact.<p>I remember the same discussion about CDN-hosted JavaScript libraries. People argued that linking to a 3rd-party server made their site <i>more robust</i> simply because CDNs normally have a higher uptime than a standard web hosting server. This was of course completely beside the point, because (again) either one of the two failing meant the site would break. That's why it has become customary to have a local fallback for CDN-hosted JS libraries now.",1336006065

3921890,comment,3917637,3918034,4,0,adrocknaphobia,,,"The history of the project is quite simple. We wanted to see if it was possible to build a high quality code editor for web development in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The idea being two fold. The engineers working on Brackets would experience the day-to-day development pains of building for the web so they would be in a better position to innovate new solutions. The other benefit is that most open source tools are out of the reach of their target audiences. If you have the skills to use Brackets, you have the skills to build Brackets.<p>Our original prototype ran completely in the browser using node.js for file i/o. So why did we take it out of the browser and focus on the desktop first? While we believe the future of development is heading towards the cloud, we found that many people are still looking for traditional desktop tools. By starting on he desktop and then supplementing with a cloud-based version, we hope to help transition developers to this new model, without asking them to give up what know and love.<p>Of course, it's not just about the cloud. Because we're developing on the open web platform, we can go wherever that platforms goes. While it's not our immediate focus we hope to build a version of Brackets optimized for tablets as well as an embedded version that could run inside existing web application.<p>Adobe has committed some of its best engineering talent to the project for the foreseeable future. If you check the activity on the repo, you'll see it's not a part-time side project. We have a long way to go before we would declare 1.0, but we think we can get there for the desktop version within the year.<p>I invite everyone to join our mailing list (<a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev</a>) or pop in to Freenode IRC channel #brackets to chat w/ the development team.<p>---<p>Adam Lehman\nBrackets Product Manager",1336005953

In fact, my son could discover it decades after I'm dead, with no other communication between us.<p>Current digital solutions, however, require more or less constant upkeep. Physical media such as hard drives, DVDs and flash is susceptible to both catastrophic failure and bit rot with a half life of only about 5 years (in my experience).

The only thing I remember for sure about +1 was that Google made me hyper aware that my +1's were public.  Which is why I almost never +1 anything except those that reflect well on me professionally (ie. it's about projecting an image of myself, nothing to do with what I actually like).  Ironically a few weeks ago somebody +1's one of my Google Code projects and I was quite surprised that I couldn't find out who it was.  It turns out that +1's are public but in a very confusing way. I suppose on that person's profile somewhere the +1 is visible, but I have no way to find it.",1336003811

So give them small wins at first and give them an idea of what it's all about, then ramp up the difficulty once they've figured out what they want to do.<p>A common ""tell"" for this I find is that they move from ""how does 'x' work"" to ""I need to do this thing; how do I do that?"" combined with doing lots of stuff (They might do it in a weird, non-programmer way, but they'll still be doing it).",1336003229

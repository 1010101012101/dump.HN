That&#x27;s the usual focus for the first few years of dealing with a rare condition: the search for a diagnosis. You may have a dozen symptoms, and a given condition may overlap with eight of them, and with six of another, and with ten of another, but something stands in the way of getting a diagnosis.<p>Eventually, you may have exhausted your options for diagnoses. None of the existing conditions fit what you have, for one reason or another. At that point, the best you can hope for is to find other people who match what you have.

This approach is limited to 3 breakpoints. Most moder debuggers do software breakpoints, that is when you set a break point for a particular line or instruction, the debuggrr replaces the first byte of the instruction with an int3 instruction (usually interrupt instructions are two byte wide, so technically int3 and &quot;int 3&quot; are different) but regardless the debugger slusually stores the actual instruction byte in a table to replace the int3 when it is actually hit. I suppose one could do this differently by causing a page fault (a simple bit switch from present to not present in the page table) and then monitoring the CR2 register to get the address of the executing code or the daya that is being accesed. One point I forgot to mention is that the x86 has hardware support for single-stepping instructions (a simple flag). But all of these methods require operating system support.",1416872938

The author phrases it in terms of &quot;omg kids and their cell phones, lol&quot; but it&#x27;s at least worth contemplating:<p>- there was a massive campaign of neighborhood destruction from post-WW2 era to perhaps the mid 1990s, resulting in atomization, suburbanization, and quasi-military occupation of the remainder.  There is a robust hypothesis that city living is at the root of civic engagment and that, eg, the Great Migrations explain the timing of the civil rights movement.  Suburbanization is basically that in reverse.  The atomization that happens when you geniunely can&#x27;t trust your neighbors is as well.<p>- &quot;civic engagement&quot; of a kind retrospectively judged to be &quot;wrong&quot; now goes on your Permanent Record. It&#x27;s potentially unsafe to organize to do many meaningful things.<p>- major institutions have lost their ability to be as exclusionist as they historically felt necessary to prevent entryism that fundamentally changes the nature of the institution.  Instutions historically leading &quot;civic engagment&quot; become ineffective or lose their original purpose.<p>- relentless focus on vacant aggregation-friendly metrics amongst our elite.  You can put &quot;volunteer hours&quot; on a spreadsheet, thus, you get the optimal number of &quot;volunteer hours&quot;, rather than civic engagment per se.  Elite high school & college-age populations simply lack time for meaningful civic engagement, most of which is indistinguishable on a spreadsheet from &quot;hanging out&quot; - ironically, &quot;chilling on the agora&quot; is essentially what civic engagement breaks down to.",1416872635

a) Answering questions and building global list of answers, as in this case.

In practice this caused enough difficulty that the programming language community has moved steadily away from dynamic scoping.<p>You make an interesting parallel with prototype lookup, but it&#x27;s worth noting that the prevailing pattern of prototype use mimics the traditional class and instance rubric.

8655322,comment,8653207,8655219,0,0,sampo,,,"Well, for starters,<p><pre><code>    start env = function
      | [] -> ()
      | line :: lines
        when String.length line > 4 && String.sub line 0 3 = &quot;+++&quot; ->
          header env line;
          modified env 0 lines
      | _ :: lines -> start env lines
</code></pre>
is a bit elitist way to write a 2 argument function as a combination of 1 argument function and a lambda function. So let me rewrite:<p><pre><code>    start (env) (list) = match list with
      | [] -> ()
      | line :: lines
          when String.length line > 4 && String.sub line 0 3 = &quot;+++&quot; ->
          header env line;
          modified env 0 lines
      | _ :: lines -> start env lines
</code></pre>
So the function `start` takes some kind of state `env` as a first argument, and then it takes a list as a second argument, here named `list`.<p>If the list is empty, [], it does nothing.<p>If the first list element, which is a string, starts with &quot;+++&quot;, it calls two other functions: first header(env,line) where `line` is now the first list element, and then modified(env,0,lines) where `lines` is the rest of the list, not containing the first element.<p>If the first list element does not start with +++, it recurses to the rest of the list.<p>So this is not a filter: After first encounter of &quot;+++&quot; it calls those two other functions and stops.",1416871515

8655285,comment,8651641,8653267,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Perhaps I can fill in some of the history.<p>To the best of my knowledge, React is indeed the first &quot;mainstream&quot; UI framework for JavaScript to be so fundamentally built around a virtual DOM. I think as a minimum the React team deserve credit for popularising the idea and for raising awareness of the underlying performance characteristics of browsers that make the idea relevant in practice.<p>That said, many of the &quot;big ideas&quot; that have been popularised among front-end web developers in recent years by big name frameworks are not even remotely new to the programming world as a whole.<p>For example, it&#x27;s hardly news to anyone who&#x27;s worked on browser-based UIs that DOM updates are often the bottleneck. However, back in the days of IE6/7 and the early versions of Mozilla or even Firefox and Chrome, JS generally and DOM updates in particular were far slower than they are in modern browsers. People have been writing UI code specifically to minimise DOM updates since long before the likes of Angular and React came along, because what is done today as a performance boost for relatively large and complicated pages used to be a necessity to get acceptable performance out of any JS-based UI at all (the major alternatives being either plugins like Flash or Java, which ran routine UI code <i>much</i> faster in those days, or doing pretty much all of the work server-side using old school web forms).<p>It&#x27;s also hardly news to anyone who worked with client-server apps a few years ago, when again things were much slower and more specifically bandwidth was a fraction of what we enjoy today, that sending patches instead of complete data can be an easy performance win. (People have been using the rsync technique for a couple of decades or so.) In the early days of what we might now call web apps, before JSON won and everyone had numerous JSON-friendly persistence and data binding libraries to choose from, a comedian developed a format called XML that accidentally caught on when too many people didn&#x27;t realise it was a joke. (See also: XMLHttpRequest, the standard tool for retrieving JSON data from servers everywhere.) In order to avoid half the development team retiring before the first test XML data had finished downloading on a typical project, we got pretty good at designing diff/patch formats for these kinds of nested data structures.<p>Put those two ideas together, and as you can imagine, a lot of web developers wrote a lot of ad-hoc tools whose basic purpose was to take some sort of change set for the underlying data model as input and figure out some sort of reasonably small set of DOM updates to match. The canonical example would be something like updating a container in your underlying data model, where you couldn&#x27;t afford to rewrite a whole list or table element in your DOM for each inserted/changed/deleted element in the container, so you had to bundle up the changes transaction-style and then flag the DOM for a single update at the end.<p>Obviously we&#x27;ve learned a lot since the early versions of this, and today we enjoy templating and data binding libraries that can be dropped into projects with negligible effort but do the same jobs we used to spend many days automating on each new project, with all the usual benefits of consolidation and peer review that come from having generic libraries with many users and many contributors. No doubt some of the techniques used in modern frameworks like React are far more widely applicable and systematic than a lot of the old code we used to use. So in this sense, again, perhaps the React team deserve some credit for advancing the state of the art.",1416871102

Should anything be done about it?  Is Reddit responsible for the actions of this subreddit, or are the users themselves responsible?  If the users are responsible, should Reddit be forced to cooperate with law enforcement to penalize those people?  What legal penalties, if any, should be inflicted on the users?<p>You can say that it&#x27;s illegal and shouldn&#x27;t be done, but what&#x27;s fascinating to me is that when you try to think of any specific action to be taken, it&#x27;s quite difficult to come up with anything reasonable.<p>The subreddit tries to argue that it&#x27;s fair use: <a href=""https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/CopyrightBasics/fair_use.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lib.purdue.edu/uco/CopyrightBasics/fair_use.html</a><p>That seems dubious, because it&#x27;s circumventing the fee that most people have to pay.  If everyone used that subreddit rather than pay the fee, the market value of the article would drop to zero.  Surely that counts as harm in the eyes of the law?<p>To be clear, I personally believe that fees for academic articles have a terrible chilling effect and should be abolished.  It creates a situation where only an elite few have access to research that might otherwise be the decisive factor in, say, a debate about public policy, or whether someone is able to develop a certain algorithm, or help people in general.  I&#x27;m only pointing out that it&#x27;s fun to try to debate what should be done about this &quot;illegal activity.&quot;",1416871000

This does work well in PIC&#x27;s: you get some small amount of RAM (something like 64-512 bytes), and then you can attach a separate RAM chip via i2c or SPI. Perhaps if a CPU die was surrounded by a reasonable number of such buffers (something like 16 x 8 MB), we could write completely different type of code.",1416870092

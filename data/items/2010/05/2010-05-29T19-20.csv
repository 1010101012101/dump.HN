1389153,comment,1388913,1389081,0,0,evgen,,,"The problem with this analysis of aerospace progress is that you are focusing on the most obvious factors for differentiation and missing the real revolutions that are continuing to happen within the field.  Yes, airplanes today have the same approximate shape and engine types that they had thirty years ago, but that is because the Cambrian explosion of the late forties and early fifties converged upon shapes and configurations that were simply the best option given all of the different factors that had to be balanced.<p>The concord was fast, but speed is not everything.  The reason that there were no other supersonic passenger craft is because once this particular prestige project actually started flying everyone saw what a bad idea it really was; if the plane had been built and flown by private companies it would have been retired a decade earlier.  It was cramped, had abysmal fuel efficiency, and required a great deal of maintenance to keep flying.  It also turned out that few people actually needed (or were willing to pay for) the speed advantage being offered.<p>The current advances in passenger aircraft happen in areas that are not obvious to a casual observer; more efficient engines that require less maintenance, avionics that can fly the plane themselves and fly by wire systems that reduce weight and can increase safety. A modern sedan car looks very similar to one from twenty or thirty years ago, but the modern vehicle is superior in just about every possible way,  The thing that you tend to forget about all of those ""mind-blowing engineering achievements"" is that most of them failed to have any significant impact -- optimization to an extreme along a single performance axis is neat, but not really as useful or interesting as most people think.",1275161630

1389116,comment,1389011,1389105,0,0,acgourley,,,"I think if you want to sell to gyms you need a very robust system that isn't just bolted onto the exterior of the bike. Following that logic, you start to get into the game of selling exercise equipment which has been fully integrated.<p>You end up being <a href=""http://www.expresso.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.expresso.com</a> which sells some bikes with a basic video game attached. Your product is very expensive, not from a trusted name in equipment quality, and quickly feels technologically out of date.<p>I think there might be some interesting ways around it, but I need to think about it more.",1275159857

1389113,comment,1388905,1389096,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Refactoring, as talked about in Martin Fowler's book and by people who've done academic work on the subject, consists of changes that alter the structure of code while preserving functionality.<p>In many environments, specific refactorings are pre-packaged, such that they know their preconditions for working properly, and work with almost mathematical precision.  In these sorts of environments, with additional support like Unit Tests, you gradually morph from one structuring of the system into another.  This can be a lot safer than ""ripping out the plumbing and throwing the bigger pieces back together.""  (I've also done the rip/reassemble thing.  It's often fun and yields good results too.)",1275159738

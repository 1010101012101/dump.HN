1886395,comment,1885950,1886078,0,0,nickelplate,,,"I always preemptively raise my eyebrows when I come across an article about agile because, in my experience, agile is mostly used by hit-and-run managers as an excuse to avoid making the hard decisions. Apparently, ""embrace change"" makes it okay to randomly interrupt people in their work to solve the urgency du jour, only to blame them when they miss their deadline. ""Daily scrums"" give the manager the green light to avoid one-on-one interactions with his team members.<p>Interestingly, the best development teams rarely display overt enthusiasm for their ""methodology"" and just get work done.",1289311178

First, you get a relatively solid, well known storage backend, with > decade of bug fixes. Writing things reliably to disk is surprisingly hard. Then, everybody knows mysql, it is packaged and tested in any OS you would use for production. Finally, there are a huge number of tools, wrappers, etc...  the chance of using a language without mysql is near 0, for example, whereas you often need to roll your own, or use a very new one (untested) for nosql solutions.",1289311105

It would be the moment when all my hard work would pay off and I could show it to my contemporaries around the world,  to gain some really valuable knowledge about my own product, and make new connections. Slightly romantic notion,  I know.  But I must admit to being an idealist.<p>So,  when I finally did post,  it got one upvote,  and quickly disappeared.  My disappointment was significant.<p>I've been thinking about it more recently,  and have come to the conclusion that there must be a better way of using HN for this purpose. Perhaps it's possible to establish a new list for those asking for feedback for their products ?<p>HN gets hundreds (or more) of new submissions per day,  but the most interesting and significant (IMHO) are from those on the coalface launching their products.  Surely they deserve a little bit more recognition (via their own list),  because they've put months of work into their submission ?<p>I know we use the tag 'Ask HN' and 'Show HN' for our posts of this nature,  but these tags aren't always related to new products.  Perhaps there's another solution ?,  for example,  a different tag for these posts,  e.g. 'Review HN',  or whatever works - this is merely a suggestion (but a good one I hope).<p>I would love to know other people's thoughts on this.  And if it's a question of putting some work into it,  I would gladly volunteer a few hours to help make this happen, in whatever shape or form people think is best.

1886326,comment,1879724,1879724,0,0,8ren,,,"<i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> is full of inspirational stories of markets discovered retrospectively. An example off the top of my head is honda motorcycles being used as off-road recreational vehicles - this market was discovered by a sales rep observing customers doing it. This could only be apparent some time after the product was created, and sold.<p>Another is Xerography being rejected by IBM after careful (and accurate) market assessments. The market significance only appeared after Xerography was actually in use. (from <i>The Billions that Nobody Wanted</i>.)<p>So when pundits (not cdixon) tell you it's impossible to discover a market retrospectively, they are simply wrong. But they're right that it's risky; and that it's much safer to launch with buyers waiting (of course!). I think the key take-home is that: a business needs customers. (Sounds obvious? Yet it's a perennial downfall of engineer-lead startups.) Finding customers (aka marketing) is at least as much work as creating the product in the first place. To put it in perspective: if creating the product takes a few prototypes over a few months or years, it's probably reasonable to put comparable effort into marketing: a few markets and 4 P's over a few months or years. The danger is when you exhaust yourself engineering it, and collapse at the finish line - just when the second marathon starts, of marketing it.

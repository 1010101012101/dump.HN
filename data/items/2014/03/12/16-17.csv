Like enough to devote your entire education and career to. By taking jobs at tech companies they are demonstrating that they don&#x27;t possess this necessary quality. Few people do.<p>And as for the healthcare.gov debacle- being smart and a great programmer has absolutely no benefit when it comes to fixing that site. Yes there are likely major technical issues, but the main problems derive from layer upon layer of bureaucracy and policy that any project of that scope entails. I would advise smart young people to stay far, far away from any project of that nature, lest any will you had to do something meaningful will get sucked out of your body fairly quickly.",1394643548

I live in Cleveland and I met a guy on public transit a couple years back that I struck up conversation with because he was wearing a cowboy hat and boots and was clearly out of his element. He told me he was in town for an oil conference and told me all about the Bakken region and the mad rush of companies looking to get a piece of the pie.<p>Essentially, once the oil basin was discovered, all the major US oil producers stormed the region and immediately began setting up shop. As a result, they also offered massive salaries for anyone willing to come up and work, especially young guys. He told me the major draw at first was truck drivers, who were making six-figures easily (side note: the roads in and out of town were decimated due to the amount of trucking passing through). Obviously the first ones to get established are going to get the most benefit from fracking the region, so it&#x27;s easy to see why they offered such outrageous salaries.<p>Likewise, I remember him telling me about how there was absolutely nothing to do up there besides hit the bar, so that also pushes salaries higher.<p>I know software (and its wages) is the all-powerful blood of the Earth, according to HN, but don&#x27;t be so skeptical of the power of supply and demand.",1394643319

Worked for the largest (worldwide) upstream service company for a couple years. I didn&#x27;t see myself working in the industry while attending school, but I graduated at a bad time, job market wise. It was really interesting work, got to understand the industry better than most people who just read superficial information, and it paid off the student loads in little over a year. It probably would have required less if I didn&#x27;t freely spend the money on toys and party (Work hard, party hard is the industry motto).<p>Williston is what I would consider to be the Wild West. Instead of horses, everyone has trucks. Heck, I had a company truck as well. And it is dirty. People always have a mouthful of chew. Last time I worked out there (2011), housing was expensive and in shortage. The major players at the time were in the process of building up man camps to circumvent this. For those who are unfortunate in not finding a place, you would sleep in a truck. There was this shower service that was started up this entrepreneurial kid; trailers that were outfitted with private shower stalls that were charged by an hour. It&#x27;s definitely different than the pampered lifestyle one is used to.<p>Reading from the comments, some people have talked down the blue collar workers that work in this industry. Yes, they may not hold the same education as many of us, but they are some of the most down-to-earth, dependable, hard working people I have met. They are definitely more &quot;real&quot; than many of the people I&#x27;ve met in the city. This is the type of industry where you have to go in and prove yourself out of greenhorn status. Once you do that, you earn yourself great coworkers and friends. Otherwise you are going to have a bad time. You also need a thick skin and able to dish back, since this is the oil patch after all.<p>The two things that were good about Williston: Walmart (I know, I didn&#x27;t appreciate Walmart unti l I lived in the inner West states.

One of the neatest thing about growing up in rural ND with roots in small towns is that your network of people automatically extends about 100 miles in any direction.  Just last week I visited a town about 120 miles removed from my own home town and this conversation played out:<p>&quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Tom Becker, I&#x27;m here to do X&quot;\n&quot;Becker?  Do you know Bill Becker?&quot;\n&quot;I do!  He&#x27;s my cousin!&quot;<p>And immediately everyone is totally disarmed and we have common ground even though we live half a state away.  Everyone really does have no more than 1 or 2 social links separating everyone else in a region.  Your last name is a really powerful device in a conversation with other people and it&#x27;s really awesome to have that kind of link to a people in a country that otherwise is completely devoid of that and culture in general.<p>With the huge influx of people in north western ND, that is no longer true of that area.  In fact, my &#x27;regional social bubble&#x27; has been effectively cut to about 70% of it&#x27;s original size because the people that live west of me aren&#x27;t the same people that used to live west of me.<p>This brings me to my second problem:  People don&#x27;t want to, or literally cannot stay in their home towns.<p>It has become very, very expensive to live west of Glen Ullin, and if you are a woman, it has also become very dangerous.  Renting in Dickinson costs comically huge amounts of money and if you happened to own a house in Williston, well your property tax has went up by a factor of four so sucks to be you if you can&#x27;t pay that any more.  If you want to purchase gas in Dickinson or any further west, you need to prepay for it, which is an idea that didn&#x27;t exist in the region before all this, but again, crime has become an issue.<p>Somehow, Williston is still operating in the red because infrastructure costs money turns out and paying for all the public services required of a city that is growing at the rate it is is crippling, not to mention the police force is way understaffed because the kinds of people that are attracted to these kinds of jobs are also the kind of people that tend to commit a cocktail of felonies in a state where crime may have well used to not exist.<p>Meanwhile, despite all these problems, the state has decided to play super nice with the oil companies and reduce tax rates for them no less than twice since they&#x27;ve shown up for reasons I can&#x27;t quite comprehend (again, Williston and other cities still operate in the red because of all of this.)<p>The existing infrastructure is going to total shit and the roads are incredibly dangerous, especially during the winter months.  We have trains that are blowing up in cities 250 miles away for reasons that may or may not be caused by this  boom.  There are a dozen oil spills every month and the drinking water has become very questionable for cities that are in the Bakken region.<p>All this on top of what has been done to the environment proper.  What used to be rolling plains is now a shitshow of wells and flares.  Unlike coal mines, which are required to restore the prairie to a state that was equal to or better than how they found it, no such strict laws exist for oil companies, so guess what it&#x27;s going to look like 30 years from now. I mean, you literally have coal companies like Great River displaying the state of their mines after restoration and bragging about how much better everything is after they leave with &#x27;before, during, after&#x27; picture galleries.  That will probably not exist in the oil company&#x27;s PR portfolio.<p>Finally, the state was operating in the black before all this.  We didn&#x27;t need this at all.  What the state should have said is something to the effect of,<p>&quot;You can come and drill, but you will pay for everything you do.  Any cost of anything, whether it be infrastructure, property taxes of existing citizens, expansion of emergency and civil services, eventual decommissioning costs, spills, accidents and problems and all their associated costs -- those costs are your&#x27;s to take on, plus taxes.  If you don&#x27;t want to pay all that, then kindly consider your requests denied until a point where you are willing to actually pay for the hell you are about to unleash on the state.&quot;<p>That of course didn&#x27;t happen, so now we are here.  We have a third of the state converted to a total wasteland, their residents effectively told to &#x27;deal with it&#x27;, all for reasons that almost certainly come back to the almighty dollar that only a select few will actually ever see.<p>Fuck the oil boom",1394642336

Because a landlord has to evaluate a potential tenant for a lifetime lease, a lot of the same negative dynamics apply during the rental transaction. The landlord is trying to reduce their uncertainty - finding a tenant who will not only pay the greatest possible rent, but also stay for the shortest possible time.<p>As market prices rise, tenants of rent-controlled units are highly incentivized to stay in their current home, because a new lease would be so much more expensive. This further reduces the available supply.<p>It gets even worse when you consider the variety of protected classes SF rental law has created. Elderly and disabled tenants cannot be evicted without special cause, even if they&#x27;ve stopped paying rent years ago. The intent of the law is good: to protect vulnerable populations who would suffer greatly if they were evicted. But in effect, it only protects vulnerable tenants who already have a lease. Every other member of that class will find it much harder to find housing, because their tenancy comes with strings attached. There are anti-discrimination provisions in housing law, but in a competitive market, those are incredibly difficult to enforce.",1394641231

For someone to be standing 6 feet from you and be told it&#x27;d &quot;easier&quot; to go back to their desk and send you an email instead of just talking to you is ... counter-intuitive at the very least. Unbelievable to some.</i><p>It depends. When someone is stuck on a compiling issue, pinging me on our chat/IRC is clearly easier than speaking loudly and hoping I&#x27;ll hear and help. But at the same time, being able to hear other people discussions and chose when I think I&#x27;d be able to help is awesome. It also helps me learn a lot just by hearing other people technical issues.<p>Also open floorplan does not mean &quot;just 8 members of your team&quot; in the same place. Where I was before it meant 120 developers working on different project for the company but in the same place. An issue with this is that people outside of the developer teams would just pop over to my desk because I was the one that seemed available to ask for things. This can be annoying if it happens 10 times a day especially when none of the questions have anything to do with you. Explaining them that sending an email with questions would help worked most of the time and forced them to try and contact the right person instead of asking the developer closest to the door especially at lunch time.<p><i>If this is actually the case, you&#x27;re in the minority. After doing this for... 19(?) years, few developers I&#x27;ve met or worked with are actually more productive in open environments</i><p>That may well be true.

That&#x27;s not the state of nature, you&#x27;ve clearly made some kind of decision to do that.<p>Good question. If you mean: &quot;Why do you choose to ship code?&quot; then I suppose it&#x27;s my desire to please my clients and stay employed. If you mean: &quot;How do you manage it?&quot; then it&#x27;s what I hinted at earlier: Good intuition, experience, a precise and logical mind, and thoughtful use of tools.<p>About tools: My tools are important to me, but I don&#x27;t see them as a silver bullet. It&#x27;s like if you asked a carpenter about a &quot;hammer-centric methodology.&quot; She would laugh. She&#x27;d say yeah, she uses a hammer all the time, but her hammer use doesn&#x27;t amount to a methodology or a philosophy. Hammer use just comes about naturally as a consequence of recognizing nails that must be driven in.<p>Similarly for software: I don&#x27;t use to-do lists because they&#x27;re &quot;agile.&quot; I use them because I need to remember the 20 different requests my client made yesterday. Could I live without Asana, Basecamp, or what have you? Sure. I&#x27;d just write my tasks in a text file. What if I couldn&#x27;t use a text file? Then I&#x27;d put sticky notes on my wall. I need tools (everyone does), but I don&#x27;t deify them.<p>> 80% of agile can be summed up as: limit work in progress, and (almost as a necessary consequence of this) ensure any given piece of work can go from initial requirement to deployed to customer very quickly. My &quot;in the trenches&quot; experience is that whether or not a company follows this is the most accurate single predictor of whether it succeeds. So methodologies do, in fact, get projects done.<p>I agree with all of the above except for the statement that &quot;methodologies do, in fact, get projects done.&quot; I think the reason we disagree is that we mean different things by &quot;methodology.&quot; I take &quot;methodology&quot; to mean a formalized process, like a recipe, that you can follow mechanically. By that definition, agility is the explicit rejection of methodologies.<p>But then, I&#x27;m not the god of word definitions. I don&#x27;t get to say my definition of &quot;methodology&quot; is right and yours is wrong. So perhaps it&#x27;s fair to say that we&#x27;re each right insofar as we&#x27;re permitted our respective definitions of &quot;methodology.&quot;",1394640397

The backend system already maps patients to rooms and providers are used to thinking this way. Providers are also accustomed to confirming ID verbally with patient and always using the bracelet to be absolutely certain when dispensing meds or starting a procedure.

If so, that&#x27;s possibly bad because a lot of players have a propensity to just run as admin[0] due to script extenders in the various games, which are required for a lot of the most popular plugins (e.g. SkyUI).<p>Used innocently, this could be really cool for modders. Check for updates or even download patches while the game is running for example.

I make a point of taking public transit all over the world and have made transit work for me in Europe, Asia, rural parts of Mexico... but I couldn&#x27;t in Greensboro. The transit instructions to get to & from the airport on a weekend involved steps like, &quot;get a taxi, take it 20 miles to this bus line, then sit on the bus line for an hour&quot; when the hotel was 15 miles from the airport.<p>I tried to walk to a fellow conference-goer&#x27;s hotel from my hotel to meet up for dinner. It was just 2 block. After confronting a bunch of 10-foot tall fences around parking lots and ending up on a highway entrance ramp from a dead-end sidewalk, only 50 feet from my destination but unable to get there, I was finally forced to admit that car is king there and they don&#x27;t want you walking. (I did finish walking there by going around all the fences, darting down an unlit busy street in a valley with no sidewalk and no shoulder, and approaching from the other side.)<p>Being my cynical self, I don&#x27;t think the government didn&#x27;t care enough to make infrastructure investments possible. I think they actively didn&#x27;t want to give handouts to those no-good lazy moochers of government service who oughta get real jobs and get a car like responsible citizens.<p>I&#x27;ve heard Heritage Foundation people and others argue very strongly that people should just buy cars -- public transportation is an inefficient handout -- but I can&#x27;t find any quotes right now.

Does it confirm that language capacity is innate, that Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;language organ&quot; (I&#x27;m sure he rues the day he ever used that phrase; he&#x27;s been trying to clarify what he meant for sixty years) exists? It&#x27;s not the only occurrence of this sort that is known but it&#x27;s the first that was documented as it happened. (Hawaiian Creole English also arose among children in relatively recent times, but its documentation is oblique, consisting mostly of recorded complaints about a new and obviously unacceptable manner of speaking among &quot;today&#x27;s youth&quot;.)<p>It&#x27;s important to keep in mind that these kids were not taught the language, they developed it on their own because they had no real language. They had ways of communicating, of course, through <i>mimicas</i>, but fundamentally humans are unsatisfied with merely making their needs known. Language—the movement of thought from one skull to another—is a huge part of what we are.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating story, but there are better tellings of it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaraguan_Sign_Language</a>",1448286672

It is the merger result of the so called &quot;red&quot; and &quot;white&quot; co-op chains.<p>S-ryhmä, together with the private chain of stores (K-ryhmä) are now seen as a politically corrupt duopoly which is responsible for the high price of food in the country. S-ryhmä &quot;owns&quot; many politicians and have a disproportionately large influence on zoning decisions made by municipalities so that competing stores face a barrier of entry to market as they cannot get a plot to build a shop. The locally emerging German giant, Lidl, is seen as a healthy influence here, bringing some competition to the market.<p>So, all in all, co-ops are not inherently good.<p>(Market share: S-shops have 46 %, K-shops have 33 %, Lidl has 8 %. Spar has all but disappeared. S-shops sell much of the same stuff as you find in a  Co-op in Sweden, as they work together in purchasing logistics to achieve economies of scale.)<p>(PS: If you see a shop marked with &quot;KKK&quot; in Finland, don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not owned by the Ku Klux Klan.

The problem is precisely this:<p>> With Ubuntu and <i>any other software</i>, you get the source and it is up to you to deal with the replacement of any trademark strings.<p>(Emphasis mine)<p>That&#x27;s not true of <i>any</i> other software!<p>I&#x27;m not sure how things are for RHEL, but I imagine they&#x27;re basically similar to Fedora. Fedora doesn&#x27;t fuzzily require you to &quot;remove and replace all trademarks&quot;. It explicitly requires you to remove the branding -- i.e. repository information, change logs and logos. They even provide a nice list of what you have to remove. Everything that you must replace is in three packages.<p>Now, I&#x27;d normally just suspect mjg59 of bitterness, were it not for Canonical&#x27;s PR dance around the issue.<p>The accusation is clear: mjg59 thinks that Canonical is intentionally keeping the wording vague so that they can have a word to say in who is developing products based on Ubuntu. Anyone who wants to use something based on Ubuntu has to ask for approval. Otherwise you might end up in court because you didn&#x27;t remove &quot;Removed spurious call to foo_frobnicate() to fix crashes on Xubuntu&quot; from an upstream changelog.<p>Canonical has been handing out these approvals for free so far, but I don&#x27;t think any requests came from current or future competitors. There&#x27;s no reason to believe that Canonical would be as eager to approve a direct Ubuntu Phone competitor.<p>Yes yes, it&#x27;s in their interest to not be as eager, but if this was such a big problem, they should have thought twice before basing their business around a bunch of GPLd products.<p>It&#x27;s hard to suspect Canonical of good intentions when every single answer they handed out managed to answer another question. The dialog so far has basically been:<p>Q: Oh hi guys, look... I&#x27;d like to make an Ubuntu derivative, can you tell me <i>what I have to remove</i>?<p>A: All trademarks.<p>Q: What do you mean by all trademarks?<p>A: Or you can ask us for approval instead.<p>Q: I get it, but I&#x27;d rather just remove all trademarks... what exactly do you mean by that? Do I have to remove e.g. mentions of Ubuntu from an upstream changelog, or the @ubuntu.com e-mail address of a contributor listed in an about dialog or a CONTRIBUTORS file?<p>A: Look, we get this is important, but we have to make sure Evil Hackers don&#x27;t impersonate Ubuntu so we have to ask you to either remove all trademarks, or ask us for approval.<p>Q: But I&#x27;m not an evil hacker!<p>A: Then we&#x27;ll approve your request.<p>Q: BUT I DON&#x27;T WANT TO ASK YOU, I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO REMOVE!<p>A: Look, we get this is important, but we have to make sure Evil Hackers don&#x27;t impersonate Ubuntu so we have to ask you to either remove all trademarks, or ask us for approval.<p>It kind of gets in an infinite loop at this point.<p>Canonical could clarify the wording without opening themselves up to Evil Hackers. Their unwillingness to do so is (somewhat insultingly) veiled in arguments that are about as childish as they&#x27;re trying to imply mjg59&#x27;s are. It&#x27;s hard to suspect them of good intentions under these conditions.",1448285025

10614376,comment,10612318,10612318,0,0,oneJob,,,"During the period being discussed, the constituency of the communities participating in the Internet has completely changed. The percentage of non-paid contributors has drastically declined; the percentage of professional contributors has drastically increased. The percentage of active or contributing participants has greatly declined; the percentage of passive or consumer participants has greatly increased. The norms, laws, and conventions are increasingly made by politicians and bureaucrats and less and less by community members. The majority of interaction and activity on the Internet is now mediated and tracked by commercial interests. Even if you disagree with one or two of my points, I think you&#x27;ll grant me the general point.<p>In a strange twist on things, where in the traditional body-politic one says, &quot;It&#x27;s the economy stupid&quot;, in Internet-politics it&#x27;s actually the politics. Who participates. What are the power relations. Who makes the laws or enforces the norms. I think this is because, where as in traditional economies money and goods are scarce and so we must have a healthy economy to eat and have shelter, in the information economy scarcity is fast becoming a thing of the past and so a democracy is being replaced by a do-ocracy. Whoever builds it, makes the rules. The law is always two steps behind. So as corporations and governments increasingly hire and direct all the professionals and bureaucrats that produce the Internet, it is created in their likeness or in their interest. So participation, power dynamics, and participant empowerment become foundational.<p>Unfortunately, the tech industry often superficially dismisses traditional politics. When it does engage it often claims the ideology of libertarian or plays the part of technocrat, seeking purely utilitarian approaches. Libertarianism, you&#x27;ll please forgive me for phrasing it this way, is rather sophomoric. It&#x27;s rather like that guy in college that had the Che Guevara t-shirt, but really didn&#x27;t know what it was all about. Like it or not, we&#x27;re in a highly coordinated, interconnected, interdependent society, and just as fully realized communism was a very romantic notion but would never get the job done, libertarianism just won&#x27;t get the job done. We need each other, and we need participation from each other. And this is, in a nutshell, a political issue. Technological, disruptive, efficient &quot;solutions&quot; will not solve this problem. Or worse, the tech industry might engage purely to satisfy its commercial interests. Think about the idea that, a start-up creates a product, and then hires lawyers to &quot;legalize it&quot;. Then the start-up claims that it is libertarian or not participating in politics.<p>We need the equivalent of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; for our time. Something contemporary, but grounded in history. Something academic, but pragmatic. Something plain spoken, but inspiring. Instead, we&#x27;ve created the TPP.",1448284753

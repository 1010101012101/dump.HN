With the patent system we have today, the only way to avoid opening themselves up to this kind of suit is to stop writing software entirely.<p>Google isn't infringing on the patents and sure isn't violating the copyright.  Oracle knows that a Texas jury won't understand the technical issues and hopes Google will settle to avoid the chance of losing billions over a bogus and ignorant verdict.<p>The outcome of a jury trial in a case like this is like flipping a coin.  There won't be any hackers on the jury or else it'd be a five minute decision out of the jury room for Google.",1281736765

1602417,comment,1601247,1602099,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"The thing is, as someone stated below, Oracle is all about short-term wins. If Oracle wins this patent suit against Google and gets lots and lots of damages from it, that's nice, but it'll scare everyone away from Java. That's not good for Oracle or anyone else. If they'd just cool their jets and let things like this slide while focusing on creating great Java-based products and improving the Java ecosystem, they'd have much better long-term prospects. Even Ellison stated that Java is the most important product Oracle has ever acquired, and he's going to kill it in desperation to milk every last cent of licenses that he can get today.<p>If Oracle continues with this kind of ruthlessness, they may squeeze several million out of Google et al, but Java is done for. Nobody will want to use that platform anymore because it will be too risky legally. It'd be a huge opening for .NET and other competitors. Java would go the way of COBOL, only running in the darkest abysses of megacorporations that never modernize.<p>You can be happy that Ellison doesn't play this ""good for developers"" thing, but what's good for the goose is good for the gander. By promoting software development and Java development specifically, Oracle would be ensuring generations of Java programmers, and lots of Java-related services and licenses from enterprises. If someone without any programming experience learns Java to write code for Dalvik/Android, as they may because Android is a ""cool"" platform that would attract young programmers, they can and likely will go on to big corporate environments and continue to work in Java.",1281736711

The only thing that made CouchDB separate from most other document stores are the incrementally generate views and maybe the MVCC append-only approach or the REST interface.  
Existing Dynamo based solutions like e.g. Riak already have a REST interface, Riak's ""Bitcask"" is an append-only storage engine and as far as I know, it also features MVCC.  
So the difference between this and RIAK are the incremental views? Something that could probably be easily added using its commit hooks<p>edit: don't get me wrong, I really like couchDB. It's pleasant to work with and the incremental views are a nice feature",1281736611

For all the talk about the multicore future, nothing has yet emerged that's compellingly better than traditional approaches. Or maybe it has and it just hasn't made its way through the noise into general consciousness; I don't know. Clojure's approach here strikes me as a sort of experimental groping: add several different new concurrency primitives and see what sticks. That aspect seems quite different from the improvements Clojure offers that came from years of experience programming Common Lisp and a resultingly deep intuition about what constructs would make it more comfortable.<p>Perhaps Clojure has hit the concurrency jackpot and come up with a better way of writing parallel programs. That would be significant. It would even be significant if it offered a better way of writing a particular class of parallel programs. So far, though, I haven't seen convincing evidence of that. I'm more excited about Clojure being an incremental improvement over Common Lisp that is winning over a new audience of hackers.",1281734832

Django's admin interface is just core to the framework - not because it has to be, but in the way that the core team sees it as something that can't languish.<p>On the horizon, merb-admin is being ported to Rails 3 by Yehuda Katz (<a href=""http://yehudakatz.com/2009/12/31/spinning-up-a-new-rails-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yehudakatz.com/2009/12/31/spinning-up-a-new-rails-app...</a>).  If that comes to fruition, I think it might become a standard tool for Rails users who want admin pages.  We'll see.<p>Being a part of the framework itself makes the Django admin interface always receive attention.  Separate Rails projects do exist, but are often by one or a small number of people and not as widely used as the Django admin interface.  So, they are there, but often don't have quite the polish and utility of Django's interface.",1269539943

1218995,comment,1218630,1218904,0,0,dasil003,,,"Actually I rather enjoyed the article, especially the opening bit about the pursuit of popularity destroying blog value, but you can't just pretend that software engineering is just simply a form of engineering still in its dark ages (though it's obviously cruder than traditional engineering disciplines).  Computer science is an extension of pure math going back thousands of years, of which civil engineering is another only slightly older offshoot.  The problem spaces are simply not comparable.<p>In civil engineering you are dealing the same constraints: physics, which can be refined to perfection because they will be used billions upon billions of times throughout history and will never change.  In civil engineering the stakes are high, people will lose lives.  Finally, the parameters for success are very easy to measure in advance... it's easy to calculate how much traffic a bridge will carry, and you can even render exactly what it will look like for aesthetic evaluation before construction begins at all.<p>Contrast with software where the problem space is infinitely larger (ie. the entire realm of abstract thought vs physical space, which also makes it less intuitive by people btw).  The costs of failure and repair are most often trivial (especially for web software).  And the suitability of software is often not known at all until it is delivered (in this regard architecture has more in common with software engineering).  You can't just hand-wave these things away by stating that software engineering is an immature discipline.  Even with the exact same number of man hours behind software engineering that you have behind civil engineering, there would still be a such a tiny dent in the problem space as to leave software engineering looking primitive.<p>It's not that no one takes software engineering seriously either, take military or NASA software.  Those guys have the most advanced software engineering principles on the planet, but even there, it's specifically suited to their use case.  I'm sure there's a lot we could all learn from them, but if you want Microsoft Word to have that quality are you prepared to pay $500,000 a head to run it?<p>I agree that Joel totally threw the baby out with the bathwater in the duct-tape programmer defense, but let's not disparage the state of software engineering.  It's certainly much less disciplined than other forms of engineering, but that's simply a cost-benefit tradeoff that seems reasonably close to optimal.",1269539730

1218987,comment,1218307,1218548,0,0,njl,,,"Penny Arcade is a fascinating example of what I think of as a common pattern in creative industries... You get a creative who is amazingly talented and makes stuff that people just want; this person has no or rudimentary business skills. The creative partners with somebody else who understands the business and deeply believes in the creative. The parter provides the structure to make that creative successful.<p>The obvious example is Walt and Roy Disney. Walt would have been next to nothing if it wasn't for his brother. Roy was brilliant  at figuring out how to pay for his brother's ideas. There are a few examples in the world of fashion, genius designers who are paired with a merchandising expert.  With Penny Arcade, Jerry and Mike accidentally sold off the rights to their work for short money, and were generally stumbling along. Robert Khoo was just graduating from an MBA program. As I understand it, he walked in and said, ""I love you guys. Now I'll handle the money."" It's worked out amazingly, to everyone's enormous benefit.<p>In my head, there's some sort of way to scale all this.

So, you want elevations for a 100 mile route drawn on a map?  That's about 2-3000 points, so you only get 10-20 of such routes before hitting your daily limit.<p>Other issue is the accuracy: I am not sure the base DEM resolution they are using, but my guess is it's the standard 10meter spacing between points inside US and territories, and 30meters outside.  10meter grid spacing isn't bad at all, it's actually pretty good, but their algorithm for interpolating is non-existent.  For any point not directly on a grid point, they just average the four surrounding elevations and return that.  I have played with several interpolation schemes, and I have found either a bilinear or a cubic interpolation for interior points to be vastly superior to a nearest neighbor or averaging scheme.

Also, you design 100% of a bridge up-front because you can't ""iterate"" a bridge, but you sure as hell can iterate a website.<p>We push code out quickly and iterate because we <i>can</i>, and the consequences for system failure are minimal at best. Want to try a new lane arrangement on a bridge? If you could build bridges like you build software, you'd just build two with the competing lane designs, and get half of the car traffic to drive over each. Oh wait, you can't do that in real life. This is why I balk every time someone thinks we should be held to the same standards as traditional engineers - there's no compelling gain and everything to lose.",1269537288

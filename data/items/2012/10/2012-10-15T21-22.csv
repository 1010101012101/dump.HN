Word spreads fast in the gaming world, so something that's unique or beautiful tends to draw attention without much marketing effort.<p>Now, whether your good game makes a small profit or becomes a massive hit is a whole other question. But to separate yourself from the big ocean of failed game projects, you simply have to have a deep understanding of what makes a game interesting, and to have a team that can execute that.  There's not much you can do on the business end other than to keep everyone involved happy.<p>Luckily, the definition of a business 'success' in indie games is pretty modest; breaking even is pretty nice, and making enough to be able to start thinking about another project is a big success.",1350338080

We're still allowed to use it for a while, but in the long term it's going away.<p>- Apple has created a new identifier (the IFA), specifically for the use case of advertising. This identifier uniquely identifies a device across apps, but beyond that provides no information about the device or its user.<p>- This ID comes with strings. There's an option in Preferences to ""Limit Ad Tracking."" The terms and conditions specify that when this option is enabled, we still get access to the ID, but we are only allowed to use it for some specific purposes like conversion tracking (eg. making cost-per-action campaigns possible), and fraud detection (eg. preventing fake clicks). We are not allowed to use it to create profiles, or to improve our ad targeting algorithm. We are absolutely not allowed to divulge the information to third parties.<p>Without this, advertising wouldn't be possible. Some may think that that'd be for the best (myself included), but that's an entirely different argument, and you'd have to realize that the market would be very different (No free/freemium apps, and everything would be more expensive).

These results do tend to show that a ""centrally planned"" solution can be better for everyone than a ""free market"" solution. But as you say, by central planning I really just mean that some entity takes in everyone's preferences and outputs a global allocation, with the nice property that everyone is happy with what they got and nobody can find a way to deviate from their assignment and be better off. One might argue that a ""free market"" would find the same solution eventually, but it might be slower.<p>These two results are sort of the opposite of the Invisible Hand stuff as well as the common assumption that, for instance, everyone values money the same (which underlies the justification for much of economics).

If x is a function and y is an integer, then it can't possibly hold that x = y.<p>Consider x = O(n). The implication would be that whatever type of thing O(n) is, x also is. This is trivially untrue.<p>If x = y, and x is a function, then x(K) = y(K). It would be ridiculous to say that x(K) = O(n)(k).<p>> Yes well, f(x) = f(y) does not implies x = y. I think people know this ..<p>I don't understand why you are mentioning that. The issue is that x = f(z) and y = f(z), then x = y. You can't get two different values by applying the same function to the same value.<p>Saying that f is O(n), the ""is"" is not an equality statement at all, ""is"" is some other <i>function</i> exactly as you mention that people understand. It is clearly some function that is non-transitive.<p>In this case the relationship is most easily expressed using existing operators by having O(n) be a set of functions and the ""is"" in that sentence be the ""exists-in"" set operator, which is a case where the transitive property doesn't hold. Using the = symbol in that context is just bizarre when = is a otherwise always used to mean equality, which is function with special properties that don't apply here.",1350337620

4657295,comment,4656185,4656679,16,0,zissou,,,"Both Shapley and Roth are microeconomists, so the fact that you are bringing up banking and inflation is a clear signal that you don't understand anything about economics. If you want to harp on Nobel Prize winning economists regarding their work on macroeconomic theory, you're 1 year too late.<p>Shapley and Roth deal with topics that fall, at the highest level, under the field of game theory, but more specifically market design. Market design relies heavily on mechanism design, which can also be called reverse game theory. In game theory, you're interested in determining the best strategy given a set of conditions (the players, their strategies, the timing of their moves, their payoffs and the information they have [or don't have]). On the other hand, mechanism design is concerned with what the conditions have to be in order to achieve a specific objective or outcome. Hence, mechanism design problems map well onto many problems of regulation.<p>For example, let's say there is a Senator, call her Mrs. X, who is interested in passing a bill that achieves outcome Y. The mechanism design solution is then the set of rules that lead to outcome Y occurring. Setting the right rules refers to Mrs. X drafting a bill that includes mechanisms such that every actor in the game HAS AN INCENTIVE to play the strategy/strategies that lead to outcome Y.<p>How does this fit in with market design? Well, besides generally using mechanism design to align the incentives of both the buyers and sellers, there is a deeper point to be made about market design here. All so often in economic theory it is assumed that a market already exists, and the analysis is then on understanding the inner functions of that market. However, what that type of analysis leaves out is how that market even came into existence in the first place. In what ways were incentives aligned such that both buyers and sellers found a match for one and other to begin with? In other words, why is this market here and how did it get here? These are the nature of the questions that market design tries to answer. By understanding how and why the actors in the market are doing what they are doing, you begin to understand how markets form. And if you understand how markets form, you can apply that know-how to the formation of new markets, or to improve old ones.",1350337490

Let f(n)=3n, let g(n)=5n. Using big-O notation, f(n)=O(n), g(n)=O(n). Were the equal sign behaving normally, then O(n) would be a single well-defined object, and one could use transitivity to conclude that 3n=5n.

Here is what I did:<p>- Cleaned up my Linkedin profile. Set my title to my desired position (Android Developer). I worked on my resume and made it as detailed as possible but still fit in 2 pages. In the Linkedin ""Summary"" field, I put in my objective, goal and my ""Professional Summary"". Then I filled in the experience, courses and projects. I got endorsements and recommendations from my former colleagues. Next; I bought ""Job Seeker"" membership from Linkedin, put on the ""Job Seeker"" badge, and opt in for OpenLink. This made it easier for people to find me and message me. After all these, my profile views and search appearances skyrocketed. The next thing I am considering is, setting my Linkedin location to San Francisco (I am temporarily in Chicagoland) so that recruiters in SF can find me.<p>- I built a single page resume site (<a href=""http://bit.ly/aydinli_resume"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/aydinli_resume</a>), put links to my Linkedin, AngelList and Github. I also have Google Analytics. Nothing fancy, and mobile compatible. I also had business cards with a QR code linked to my resume site.<p>- Here is a list of websites I use to search for jobs (in no particular order):<p><pre><code>  + Indeed

Currently, I don't have any problems finding jobs to apply. I search for jobs, if the project seems interesting, I apply and ask for more information. The problem I have is; companies don't have to reply to your application whether good or bad. It doesn't matter if it is a giant company or a startup founder that gives out his/her personal email for applications, you rarely get an answer. Even with tools they have, like jobvite, resumator, jobscore, etc., they very rarely reply. I am getting used to it though.",1350335233

It probably has big moons though, and with all the suns around they might be warm enough to develop life. I haven't done the math, but I'm guessing that when the moon is on the night side of the planet relative to the nearby stars, the location of the distant stars would cycle in basically the same way Jupiter does in our sky. It moves slowly relative to the background stars, but still rises and sets every day.<p>I don't know the details and couldn't do the math if I did, but I'm guessing those stars at 1000AU can't be much brighter than our full moon is, maybe combined with the light pollution of a big city. I've lived outside of New York all my life, and my night sky still has stars in it. Not many, but enough to know they're there, and sometimes on a clear night I can see quite a few.",1350335069

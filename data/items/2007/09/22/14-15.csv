With pre-revenue companies, there are two important questions for the VCs to ask themselves:<p>1. How much money do they need? \n2. How large a percentage of equity do we want?<p>#1 can be easily determined. #2 needs to be played with a bit, as a good VC firm won't want to take enough equity to demotivate the founders at all, yet still wants to see an attractive return (based very roughly on their own financial projections for your startup).<p>#1 * 1/#2 = post-money (after investment) valuation<p>post-money valuation - #1 = pre-money (before investment) valuation<p>This is, of course, how it works after a firm has decided to make an investment in your startup. Good VCs won't really even bother with pre-revenue company valuations until after they've decided that they want to work with you.\n",1190472491

I usually call C++ a pointless annoying trivia contest but I really like the image of a minefield.\n  \nMaybe programming in C++ is like a game show where if you get all the answers right the grand prize is not having to go in to work every weekend for a month to hunt down memory leaks but if you get even a single one wrong you have to walk through a minefield while a bloodthirsty studio audience cheers you on.<p>""Oops, sorry contestant #1. You forget to say that what you were deleting is an array. Since your code compiled you can still stay in the game by walking across that minefield.""<p>Step, step, pause, step, pause, breathe deeply, step, step, KABOOM!<p><p>\n",1190471994

Likewise, I minored in psychology to understand the nature of my own behavior so that I would be more capable of changing it.  To loosely quote everyone's favorite philosopher ""everyone is a philosopher whether they realize it or not"".  Meaning most people are living by their subconscious impulses, but the philosopher becomes introspective and question how they are living.  Nothing could be more practical, but as PG points out philosophy does not usually have this goal in mind.",1190471981

Sorting by distance just doesn't cut it in densely populated places.<p>Any ideas for a solution aside from forcing users to check off boxes or selecting predetermined neighborhoods by admins?",1190471168

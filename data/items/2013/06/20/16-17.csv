That does not make it any less useful to the rest of the population.<p>There are tons of delicious foods that you can&#x27;t buy in any restaurant or store no matter how much you&#x27;re willing to pay, because a small percentage of people are allergic or whatever. So the entire population gets essentially zero use out of them even though they could be useful to the vast majority of people. (In fact, restaurants/stores/farmers markets only carry only a small percentage of the total foods out there.) Similarly a ride at an amusement park that is safe for the vast majority of people is a ride that no one is going to be allowed to go on.<p>Medicine is just a special case because doctors generally won&#x27;t lose their license for killing the occasional patient, whereas, say, a restaurateur probably would.",1371747585

The key word here is &quot;basics&quot;. A professional level of skill goes beyond basics. As a web designer, one can get the basics down of CSS, for example in just a day&#x27;s workshop at a conference. That said, to be of any real value as a professional, you really need more insight than what a basic understanding gives you.<p>As for your comment about wanting back-end people refusing to do front-end work - actually, I myself do not have a problem with this. I believe people should do what motivates them at work and not get strong armed into doing things that fall outside of their professional interests. There is a limit to this of course, but in this case, there are definitely front-end people who will do the job better and take it as their career passion.",1371747462

These words have deep historical roots and deep meaning, and to use them in situations where it isn&#x27;t appropriate is trivializing.

I see a huge improvement in the quality of answers of most students, once students know it is a gag and once they&#x27;ve been shown how to estimate things. Most students are constrained by having been in a learning environment that provides them with well-defined boundaries within which to form their answers.

The situation is still all well within\nthe US Constitution in the sense of want people &quot;can do&quot;.\nIn particular, as I will outline, there is a very fast, simple solution well within what &quot;the minority can do&quot;.<p>Background:\nIn the US Federal Government, there are three branches,\nexecutive (e.g., headed by the president), the legislative (i.e., Congress), and the judicial (with the Supreme Court).<p>In the case of the Snowden leaks, the actions Snowden was\nobjecting to were by the executive branch which (more or less) was following laws passed by the legislative branch and signed into law by the executive branch.  So far so good, that is, within the Constitution.  Note that the judicial branch is not involved in passing or\nsigning such laws and so far has not been\ninvolved in this whole matter.<p>But looking at the laws and what the executive branch did that Snowden revealed, a &quot;minority&quot; might conclude that the Constitution was violated.  Really, still, so far so good because it&#x27;s not up to the legislative or executive branch\nto determine if the Constitution was violated.  It&#x27;s been\ncommon throughout US history for the legislative branch\nto pass laws and the executive branch to sign and use those laws but later the US courts, usually including the US Supreme Court, to find that the laws were &quot;unconstitutional&quot;\nand strike them down.<p>So for what a &quot;minority can do&quot; in this case?  Sure: \nBring a law suit in the judicial branch where the\nsuit claims that the Constitution, e.g., First or\nFourth Amendment, was violated.  Typically the case\n(I don&#x27;t know the details of the process) makes it\nto the US Supreme Court.  For the role of a &quot;minority&quot;,\nin principle only one person need bring the case.<p>We should guess that people highly concerned with the\nsituation leaked by Snowden will bring such cases.  So,\nwe will look for the ACLU and the EFF.  But now we also\nsee that Google is bringing a case.  The legal costs\nfor bringing a case might be significant, but there\nare plenty of organizations and individuals with\nmuch more than enough money to pay for those costs.\nLikely cases will be brought.<p>My guess is that much of the relevant laws will be\nstruck down.<p>So, why has the judicial branch or the Supreme Court not\nyet struck down the relevant laws?  Because they don&#x27;t\ndo that; instead, there has to be a legal case brought.<p>In all of this, the Supreme Court will act \nvery cautiously.  And in principle there is\nnothing important to keep them from acting\nquickly.<p>Net, so far the US Constitution is working just\nas intended.  No riots in the streets are needed\nyet.  We just need for some cases to be brought.\nThat the laws mandated a lot of secrecy may have\nhelped slow the bringing of cases, but likely Google,\nMicrosoft, and some individuals have plenty of\n&#x27;legal standing&#x27; to bring suitable cases.<p>So far the legislative branch passed some laws.\nThey can do that.  The laws can later be found\nto violate the Constitution and even then we\ndon&#x27;t line up the people in Congress who\npassed the laws and shoot them.  Similarly\nfor the executive branch:  Once Congress has\npassed a law, the executive branch can sign\nit and use it.<p>Net, there is only one branch that can say\nif a law is constitutional or not, the\njudicial branch, and so far apparently no\nsuitable case has been brought and the\njudicial branch has yet to speak.<p>Indeed, I have a letter drafted to my\nmembers of Congress but have not sent it\nbecause the letter really just claims\nthat the relevant laws were unconstitutional,\nand for the members of Congress such\nclaims are nearly irrelevant.<p>Net, we just need a suitable case in the\nSupreme Court.  The Supreme Court will\nhave no difficulty at all understanding\nall the relevant issues, and that court\nhas plenty of ability to slap down laws\npassed by Congress and signed and used by\nthe executive branch.  Slapping down\nunconstitutional laws is much of just\nwhy the Supreme Court is there, and they\nare 100% fully aware of that point.<p>Some of the recent appointees to the\nSupreme Court are quite &#x27;liberal&#x27;, but\nnearly always they are plenty bright\nand will see the constitutional issues\nin the activities Snowden described\nwith crystal clarity and intense concern.<p>The fight over the constitutionality of the relevant laws\nis not nearly over and, indeed, has yet to\nbegin but apparently is about to begin.\nDon&#x27;t bet on those laws coming out whole.<p>In particular the Constitution says nothing\nabout violating the Constitution \nwith secret orders of the executive branch\nbased on wacko laws and approved by a\nsecret &#x27;court&#x27; of persons appointed by\na member of the judicial branch with secret oversight\nby committees of Congress.  Maybe the people\nwho dreamed up this wacko nonsense thought\nthat they were clever, but they were not:\nWhat they constructed has nothing to do with\nthe Constitution, and the Supreme Court\nwill have no difficulty at all seeing\nthis point.<p>If the Supreme Court strikes down the laws,\nthey will be gone -- out&#x27;a here.  And that&#x27;s\njust the way the Constitution says the\nprocess is supposed to work.<p>We&#x27;re a government of laws, not men:  What\nmatters are the laws, not what Presidents\nBush and Obama say, what General Alexander\nsays, what the FISA &#x27;court&#x27; says,\nor what the Intelligence committees of\nCongress say.  Instead what matters here\nis what laws the Supreme Court says are\nconstitutional.",1371745786

Any consulting I do, I&#x27;d have to do more of living in  SF or NYC, which takes time from building the business. Any savings I have gets eaten up faster in SF or NYC and lessens my runway. That&#x27;s reality.<p>-I don&#x27;t need to look for a developer/technical co-founder in order to get started. My Wordpress instance is up and I just write.<p>-I don&#x27;t have a trust fund or a rich uncle to mooch off of to help subsidize a lifestyle in either SF or NYC. My parents live on social security and aren&#x27;t coming to my rescue.<p>I can understand the point of it not making sense for an already growing (read: revenue producing) startup to move to a cheaper locale. That I get. But I fail to see how you&#x27;re not aiming high enough by starting out somewhere cheaper. Once you&#x27;re making enough to where you aren&#x27;t worried about where your next meal is coming from, then sure, move to SF or NYC.

One is a simple filesystem traversal problem where we ask you to build in some runtime extensibility, and the other is a binary space partitioning problem (2D bounding box query) with a very difficult performance requirement (low 10&#x27;s of ms max for 1M records).<p>All of our interviews are conducted by more senior software developers. Before we ever interview you we read through your code. These aren&#x27;t huge tasks, but they&#x27;re enough to show whether or not you use good organization. Then comes the interview...<p>We do use the first problem as sort of a litmus test. We figure that runtime instantiation of an arbitrary class which implements a known interface is a little on the edge of the realm of what you&#x27;ll be doing day-to-day, but it&#x27;s close enough that if given the problem to take home you should know how to Google the right runtime API calls to make it happen. And we&#x27;re pretty flexible. If you misunderstood the extensibility requirement and when asked how you&#x27;d make it &quot;runtime extensible&quot; you can spit out something marginally close to &quot;MyInterface blarg = (MyInterface)Class.forName(pluginFQDN).newInstance(),&quot; or even &quot;I&#x27;d Google &#x27;instantiate class by name in Java&#x27;&quot; you&#x27;re still doing more or less fine. You&#x27;re doing <i>very</i> well if you can tell me how to add the plugin to your tool in such a way that it doesn&#x27;t leak implementation details to the user either through its use or its installation procedure.<p>We absolutely <i>do not</i> use the second problem in anything close to a pass/fail manner. If you get the optimal solution, awesome. If not, no problem. Either way, let&#x27;s talk about it. Let&#x27;s work together. Let&#x27;s have an in depth technical discussion about the various pros and cons of different techniques to solving this problem. If I say something which in the context of our discussion is by common-sense reasoning obviously wrong, will you call me out on it (preferably politely)? If I say something that you don&#x27;t understand will you just nod and smile, or will you say &quot;wait, what?&quot; Or the single biggest problem I see surprisingly often - are you capable of in some way communicating a semi-complex idea to another person who is &quot;skilled in the art,&quot; either verbally, on the whiteboard, or otherwise?

What appeals about paid marketing is very simple: definable, scalable success.<p>&quot;word of mouth generates more than twice the sales of paid advertising in categories as diverse as skincare and mobile phones.&quot;<p>While I cannot attest to this being true or false, I can say that word of paid marketing can have a very appealing success rate.<p>For example, after 5 years of marketing online with my own money I can say the following:<p>1. 73% of all campaigns failed<p>2. 22% of all campaigns that did <i>not</i> fail became a moderately profitable success (~50-100% ROI)<p>3. 5% of all campaigns became absolute smash hits, earning over their lifetimes well past many times the investment I made to find them.<p>(NOTE: ROI for this example means the amount invested to test & optimize the campaign at the start ($1k-$10k) as opposed to the actual ROI of earnings over time, which is entirely different)<p>With a 5% smash hit rate - and a 27% success rate, that is a pretty damn good risk factor. This isn&#x27;t to say that word of mouth doesn&#x27;t work - it most certainly does - but paid advertising definitely has its place.<p>If you&#x27;ve got your wits about you, use paid to jump start word of mouth, and capitalize on word of mouth with paid.

Anonymizing your production data and distributing it to developer laptops is something you should think hard about before doing it, and approach very carefully if you do.  Sometimes the sensitive information you should be protecting isn&#x27;t just the users&#x27; creds and addresses. Sometimes it&#x27;s the ways in which they&#x27;ve used your app, the content they&#x27;ve created, and the graph of other accounts with whom they&#x27;ve associated.<p>A typical anonymized DB dump is likely to share primary key values with production, and often an adversary knowing that user X posted something they&#x27;d rather keep private on your app will be able to simply look up their identity on your production server without privileged access.<p>Generating useful fake data is also hard, of course, and won&#x27;t hit your edge cases like real production data, but then again, the code you&#x27;re writing now won&#x27;t really be exercised by the unwashed masses until you release it, so using production data is mostly a protection against regressions.  If you&#x27;ve got sensitive content in your app, you should consider stronger test coverage in lieu of production dumps.  Of course performance regressions can be hard to keep under wraps with automated testing (though you can defend against things like N+1 query problems), so YMMV.",1371744430

I&#x27;m almost sure that Calculus was created by people like Newton in responce to the needs of mechanics and physics.<p>The fact that the program is implemented by using &quot; just addition, subtraction, multiplication&quot; is irrelevant, because this is how computers (and mathematical numerical methods) work.<p>For many great mathematicians the difference between math and physics is almost non-existent.

They would probably at least keep a log of correspondence received and sent, accounts payable and receivable, payment receipts, etc. If they have stories that make factual claims then they&#x27;d want to retain the journal/notes that went into each story for some nominal amount of time as well, if only to defend their name later.<p>2.

Others are less careful, and it&#x27;d be useful to know that the content you saw tagged as 0.5.9 a month ago is the same as what you see today.  Git allows you to check this, but only if you keep your repository around.<p>I can see uses extending beyond tags, where people wish to claim that code existed at a particular point in time.  It&#x27;s possible to fake the git metadata and push the faked commit.   If your notary can say that a particular commit was public, you raise the bar from changing the system clock to inventing time travel (or hacking the notary, whichever is your cup of tea).",1371744082

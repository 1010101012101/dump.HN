If the job or the environment is crap I'd be the first one to say that they probably ought to leave.<p>I am also deeply offended by your use of the term ""slave"".  Nobody has used this term.  Not one person has even implied it.  I certainly have not.  It is a despicable and desperate measure to sensationalize something that has, in no way whatsoever, implied such a condition exist or is desirable.<p>My post, and the scenario that it referred to, was very narrowly focused on the case where an agency YOU HIRE to help you find talent turns-around and proceeds to attempt to poach the very talent they helped you find just a few months after they got onboard.  That is scummy and, in my view at least, absolutely justifies a no-poaching agreement WITH THE AGENCY YOU HIRED TO HELP YOU FIND TALENT.<p>Other than that, if another company is going to reach out and offer your employees a better deal (whether that means more money, a more interesting project or better working conditions) so be it, that's the free market and nothing should impede that at all.  Even if other agencies reach out and convince the employee to leave a week after he/she came onboard, that's OK.<p>Again, the point here is very narrowly defined around the issue of a head-hunter that YOU hired turning around and poaching employees you just got done paying them a fee to find.  That is a very different issue, isn't it?<p>In order to fully illustrate the damage done I simply highlighted that there are huge costs involved in hiring and employing someone, particularly through a head-hunter, and that it is wrong for them (the head hunter) to then turn around and try to steal people away from you.<p>After a reasonable and mutually agreed-upon period they can do whatever they want.  In the example given in the OP's article that period was 18 months.  That's fine.<p>To be ultra-redundant:  \nIf someone other than the agency you hired manages to pull someone --anyone-- away from you, that's fair game.  You can do that to others as well as they can do it to you.  The issue here is with an agency that is supposed to be working for you.",1340826972

From their perspective, they likely see two things<p>1) a still growing cell phone market\n2) a rapidly growing Android market<p>As long as the market's still growing, and as long as the vast majority of Android users aren't disgruntled about being left behind, their efforts are best spent on building new phones and acquiring new customers.<p>I'm curious how many people purchasing a new Android or iOS device even know it <i>can</i> be upgraded. Apple has features in iTunes and now in the phones themselves to advertise new versions and strongly encourage users to upgrade. I'd wager most Android users, because their phones never advertise updates to them, are aware it can even be upgraded and, thus, aren't the least bit put off by these vendors apparent negligence.<p>Until the market stops growing, or until the vast majority of users get angry about being left behind, vendors like Motorola have zero incentive to spend time or capital on maintaining old devices.",1340826936
4168916,comment,4163820,4168480,7,0,lsc,,,">Good post. Loyalty in the workplace is also nonsense. We're (mostly) all capitalists here we should act like it. Never ever stay at a company because you ""love it"" or some childish notion of ""loyalty"". You should be there because it's the best allocation of your resource of time/knowledge.<p>This is how I feel...  and probably how most entrepreneurs feel.  That's why we are striking out on our own.<p>This is not how many employees feel.  One guy working for me (at wages I pay) felt actively guilty and apologized to me for interviewing with google.   I mean, he'd have gotten a staggering raise if he got the job.  (I think he's right on the edge of being good enough;  I bet if he practised interviewing and tried a few times, he could make it.  Fortunately for me, he failed the first interview, and like a lot of people, he finds interviewing uncomfortable.)  I mean, if anything, I feel a little bit proud when my employees go on to much bigger and better things; I don't have money, so I hire people that are just starting, or that have been unemployed for a while and need to start over.  I mean, I'd /like/ them to stay with me longer?  But if you aren't capable of becoming google materiel, well, I try not to let you past the 'project-based contractor' stage, so it's just plain irrational for me to expect people to stick around for my low wages forever.<p>I absolutely don't understand this.  I mean, I don't expect loyalty. (I mean, I expect honesty... but I don't expect anyone to stick around if someone else offers a lot more cash.) But, many employees really do feel something like Loyalty.   As a owner, it would be in my interest to put some effort into making those sorts more comfortable.<p>Now, what to do?  I don't really understand that feeling of loyalty, so I can't address it directly, but I can say ""besides money, what makes these people comfortable/happy? that I can give them and google can't?""  - like one benefit I give employees is extreme schedule flexibility.  Another is being careful to have an environment where your employees don't feel like they will get fired.   (yeah. I don't get this one, either.  But it's huge.  Normal people are terrified of getting let go.   But, I guess large companies do this, too.  Of course, instead of giving people severance, when I have to lay people off, I go pester all the recruiters I know and try to get them better jobs.)<p>but yeah.  this is something, I think, that we, as entrepreneurs, should study.  It's important to understand.",1340826934

First off, it's been amazing to have your patience and support over the past two years. Without your help and feedback, our product wouldn't be where it is today.<p>inDinero has been trying to support a free customer base since launching in 2010, but the costs associated with doing so have gone up considerably since. The company pays a very hefty fee to aggregate financial data, and we lose money on every non-paying user. Because of these unaffordably high costs, I've made the very difficult decision to discontinue our free plan. Many of you have told us that you'd prefer a premium/paid service that can better support a growing product. We agree that this is the direction we need to make, and we hope we have your support during this transition period.<p>The free product will be completely discontinued on July 31 2012, and real-time data from financial institutions will be limited to our paying customers. As a safety measure, we'll be deleting all transactional data that belongs to non-paying users after this July 31 cutoff date. We've made it very easy to download a copy of your data: simply go to the Transactions Page and press the ""Export"" link on the bottom of the page.<p>If you'd like to remain a customer of ours, you can upgrade your account by going to https://indinero.com/upgrade. This should take no more than a minute to do. To thank you for being supportive through this transition, we're offering three months of free service on our paid plan. Just shoot us an email and we'll give you the discount code.<p>It has been difficult for us to come to this decision, but we're certain that you'll prefer an inDinero that can properly invest in improving its service. On another note, if you're looking for an inDinero-friendly bookkeeper/accountant, please shoot us a reply. We'd love to see how we can help.<p>Cheers,<p>Jessica Mah \nCEO, inDinero.com",1340826535

For example: <a href=""http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/merge.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marklodato.github.com/visual-git-guide/merge.svg</a>. What the fuck?<p>This guide will only make your understanding of Git worse.<p>It uses incorrect terminology to mislead what Git is actually doing in a number of situations, starting with the first sentence of the first section: <i>The four commands above copy files between the working directory, the stage (also called the index), and the history (in the form of commits).</i><p>Git doesn't care about files, but <i>changesets</i> so this should raise a red flag with anyone with even a passing knowledge of how Git works. This is either a fundamental flaw in the understanding of how Git works by the OP or intentionally misleading wording.<p>In the <i></i>Commit<i></i> section, the OP writes: <i>It then points the current branch to this new commit.</i> I don't like this wording because it makes it seem like a branch is something other than a reference to a particular commit (which is available in .git/refs/heads). Really, any reference to ""current branch"" should be replaced by HEAD, because the current branch is nothing other than HEAD, and HEAD of course is just a commit.<p>In the <i></i>Checkout<i></i> section, the OP writes: <i>The checkout command is used to copy files from the history (or stage) to the working directory, and to optionally switch branches.</i> This is blatantly false. `git checkout` doesn't ""copy files""; it may move HEAD or it may get rid of any changes in the working directory, and in doing so may change the state of the files within the local repo.<p>In the <i></i>Committing with a Detached HEAD<i></i> section, the OP writes: <i>Once you check out something else, say master, the commit is (presumably) no longer referenced by anything else, and gets lost.</i> This is only partly true. The commit still remains in the reflog and can be retrieved up to the point that garbage collection is run. It's incorrect to tell someone their commits are lost as soon as they `git checkout` another treeish.<p>This guide should be binned in favor of EdgeCase's Git Immersion (<a href=""http://gitimmersion.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gitimmersion.com/</a>) and Scott Chacon's Pro Git (<a href=""http://www.git-scm.com/book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.git-scm.com/book</a>).",1340826208

Does data center run BGP over these providers? IP Transit providers - Bandwidth Pricing? Overage pricing? Straight $mbps/month? Who manages your network? Ip allotment? Assignment procedure? High density for micro vms(Heroku style)? 200 VMs per host meaning 200IPs per vm. Swip/rwhois updates on assignments? Cross-connects? Cross connect pricing? Charges? Local loop(last mile connectivity) charges? BGP support? Is our traffic on a private/separate v-lan from your other customers?<p>If you are spending more than, say, two grand a month on co-lo, you probably want different providers for your rack and your bandwidth.   Aside from the ease of moving providers to keep costs down, usually the 'house bandwidth' is often 10x market rate.  I just got a quote the other day (I only need a little bandwidth, 100Mbps at this new place)  and they wanted like $10/Mbps for single homed cogent.   $0.50-$1.00/meg is market for single homed Cogent.)<p>Most of those are reasonable questions, though most salespeople won't know how to answer them.  (and many of them, like 'local loop' charges will only make sense to telco guys.  In data centers, we call them 'cross connect fees'  and they are still important, but much less of a big deal than local loop charges when you are getting a telco line from someone off site)<p>Note, all of those questions should be asked of the bandwidth provider, not the rack provider.  except the cross connect fee  - this is what the datacenter/rack provider charges for a connection between you and a transit provider in the building.  Sometimes it's one time, but it's usually monthly, and scales directly with how nice the data centre thinks it is.  It's $50 one time for copper at he.net, but can be like $300/month+ at a coresite location for fiber.<p>Note, every bandwidth provider in the building is going to have different answers to all those questions, and even within one provider, the answers will be different based on what class of customer you are or how much you can pay.",1340825551

DNS Made Easy is adding more flexibility to enterprise DNS management and at the same time making DNS resolution over 50% faster.<p><i>Benefits of ANAME over CNAME records</i><p>* ANAME records can be created at the apex (root record) of a domain, whereas CNAME records are forbidden at the apex per DNS RFCs \n* ANAME records can exist with other record types, whereas CNAME records must be unique per DNS RFCs\n* ANAME records can exist in a round robin configuration, whereas CNAME records may not per DNS RFCs\n* ANAME records lead to a much faster result for resolving DNS servers by cutting out additional lookups inherent with the use of CNAME records<p><i>How ANAME records work</i><p>When a DNS Made Easy user creates an ANAME record, they will enter a fully qualified domain name as a value, just as they would have done if a CNAME record was created. This fully qualified domain name is looked up internally by DNS Made Easy, the resulting A records are mapped and created on DNS Made Easy name servers. DNS Made Easy will constantly monitor the value of the ANAME record, compare to the existing mapping in the ANAME comparison database, and modify the existing records if necessary.<p>ANAME records were also designed to work in conjunction with the DNS Made Easy Global Traffic Director (GTD) service. When a DNS Made Easy user creates an ANAME record in a non-default region (i.e. US West, US East, Europe, and/or Asia Pacific), the resolution of the fully qualified domain name will be done from systems sourced in that region. All mappings and record creation done with an ANAME record for a specific region will use data collected only from that region. This allows DNS Made Easy customers to provide geographically differentiated responses with ANAME records when used with the Global Traffic Director service.<p>To the DNS Made Easy user, ANAME records are configured just like CNAME records, however they have improved on the CNAME record type by eliminating the most common restrictions and performance bottlenecks.<p><i>How much does the ANAME record cost?</i><p>As with any DNS Made Easy service we constantly strive to provide maximum ROI for our clients.  As such we are providing this service at no additional charge to all clients that use our Managed DNS services.<p>For more in depth information on how ANAME records work, please see our introduction video at: http://anamerecord.com<p>For tutorials that explain how to configure ANAME records in DNS Made Easy, please visit: http://help.dnsmadeeasy.com/records/aname-record/<p>If you have any additional questions regarding ANAME records, please do not hesitate to contact us. You can reach our sales office by email at sales@dnsmadeeasy.com or by phone at +1.703.880.3095 ext 1. You can also open a support ticket at https://support.dnsmadeeasy.com.<p>Sincerely,\nDNS Made Easy",1340825388

You can retrieve multiple events at one time but you're still going to hit a network performance and CPU bottleneck serializing all that data, not to mention that you still need to process it.

They make a fantastic Gmail extension called Boomerang. Of all the upgrade emails I've received over the years, this one stands out because it does the following:<p>(1) Expresses gratitude<p>(2) Provides context (my early donation; the year of free service they gave me)<p>(3) Presents me with clear options<p>(4) Offers a sweetener<p>(5) Has a clear sign up option<p>(6) Recaps product developments<p>(7) Offers me a simple unsubscribe option<p>-------------------------------------<p>Dear Boomerang VIPs -<p>First, let me say thank you.<p>You voluntarily signed up for a paid subscription to Boomerang, before we had any pricing plans in place. Because so many of you chose to pay for the service early, we were able to demonstrate to potential investors that our service was providing a lot of value. That gave us the ability to raise the funding that allowed us to continue developing Boomerang over the last year. Without you, we couldnt have done it.<p>When you bought your subscription, we asked you to pay whatever amount you thought was fair for a one year subscription to Boomerang. When we converted Boomerang to a freemium service last July, we set you up with a one year Pro-level subscription.<p>Im writing today to let you know that your subscription will be a year old next month. There are two ways you can continue to use Boomerang.<p>[1] You can renew your paid Boomerang subscription. If you choose to continue on the Pro service level, your service will maintain the same feature set that you have been using over the past year. If you choose the Personal service level, you will no longer have access to some premium features, but you will still be able to schedule unlimited messages.<p>[2] You can use the Free Boomerang Basic plan, which provides 10 scheduled messages per month and access to the basic features in Boomerang, as long as youd like. If you do not choose to renew your paid subscription, you will automatically convert into the Boomerang Basic plan on July 15th, and all messages that you schedule before that date will be delivered as scheduled. You don't need to do anything if you want to use this plan.<p>Your early support was crucial for us, so we want to make sure we show our appreciation for your help. Please sign up using the link below, and we will apply a 40% lifetime discount to your account. Your Pro subscription will convert to a Basic subscription on July 15th, so to continue using Boomerang without interruption, please sign up before July 15th.<p>Sign Up Here [Link]<p>Over the past year, your subscriptions have enabled us to make dozens of improvements to the service: \n-Boomerang Mobile released in September. Its the only way to schedule an email from your smartphone.\n-Boomerang added the ability to schedule recurring emails in November. Gmail with Boomerang is the only mail client with this feature.\n-Boomerang now lets you add Notes to messages that you schedule to return to your Inbox. They make it easy to remember why you Boomeranged a message several months back.\n-You can now Boomerang messages in bulk. Check up to 10 messages in your Inbox, and Boomerang will return them all at a later time.\n-Finally, earlier this month, Boomerang added the ability to schedule a follow-up message, and have it only be sent if the recipient doesnt respond to your original message.<p>Thank you again for becoming the first paying Boomerang customers. Were glad weve had the opportunity to provide this service for you, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the future.<p>-Alex and the Baydin Team<p>Unsubscribe from these emails [Link]",1340824290

We can still lean on the amazing PostgreSQL community, documentation, and for the parts we don't have the source code to, the Citus team has been very helpful in explaining how things work.<p>(v) Fault tolerance is immaculate. At the node level, PostgreSQL is notoriously one of the most reliable and robust databases available. At the cluster level, Citus will magically fall back to a replica mid-query when a server dies.<p>(vi) Although realtime inserts are not supported out of the box, the system is flexible enough that we were able to get this working on our own without help from Citus.<p>(vii) Schema migrations are also not supported out of the box, but we built a schema migration framework that takes care of this for us.<p>(viii) We're not worried about vendor lock-in, since the data is just stored on our servers, in the PostgreSQL serialization format. If we wanted to, we could just give up the features that Citus gives us and build our own data-access layer on top of our cluster.<p>Anyway, it won't be everything to everyone, but it works very well for our OLAP use-case of timeseries ad impression data. I'd definitely recommend looking into it if you're otherwise considering Hadoop, Vertica, Aster, Greenplum, or a sharded MySQL/PostgreSQL setup.<p>Full disclosure: I am extremely biased since I've gotten to know the team very well after using Citus.

And when I say ""worst"" I mean ""worst at negotiating for salary"".  That is, they'd like to hire you out to a big bank for $1k/day and convince you that $200/day is a lot of money so they can pocket $800/day on you.  If that sounds bad, I've heard of worse arrangements.  In any case, whatever they get the contractor in they're going to want to keep them there as long as possible so they can continue to earn off them.<p>If you want to stop the agency who placed with you from poaching your permis then you should insist on paying the finders fee over some time period.  This avoids the need for immoral and unenforcable ""no-poach"" contracts and but gives the recruiter incentive to keep the employee in place.  Especially if you arranged payments so that payments get larger later in the employment cycle.<p>Hmmm, maybe someone should make an agency and try this model. :)  But if you do be careful because companies will try to flip it the other way: e.g. fire and re-hire the employee early on to avoid further payment (which is probably why agencies demand the fee up front now).",1340823666

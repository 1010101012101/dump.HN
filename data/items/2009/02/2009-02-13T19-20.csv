You could say that unsustainable demand was generated by policy, but I don't think that's the same thing as artificial price inflation.  People were legitimately willing to pay way too much for these (in my area at least) shoddy McMansions.<p>And I'm not defending the sequence of inanities that led up to this whole debacle.  Voted you up, too, because I think the conversation about renting versus interest is a good one.  I sold my house about half a year before the collapse and have a sweet rental at the moment.",1234555151

480297,comment,479751,480266,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"If you wanted to pick a warning example, you could have done much better than Singapore.<p>Singapore was a third-world country when the current ruling party took over in the mid-60s. Today, it has a higher per capita GDP than the United States, and three times that of neighboring Malaysia.<p>In the dark days of the 60s, Singapore was threatened by the communist plague sweeping over Southeast Asia, racial tensions and riots, and hostile neighbor states. The fact that it survives and thrives today is remarkable.<p>Yes, its government violated ""human rights"" along the way. In the 60s it aggressively persecuted communists, forbid their literature, and drove communist labor movements out of the country. This offends our Western sensibilities, but it did allow Singapore to avoid the fate of Vietnam and Cambodia. Was it worth it? I think the citizens of Singapore, both then and now, would say ""yes"".<p>In most circumstances I am a Western liberal. But I refuse to follow any ideology blindly to the point that it leads me to advocating catastrophe.<p>Today, Singapore is one of the richest countries in the world. It is regularly ranked by international organizations as one of the 10 least corrupt, often beating the United States. Maybe its people are lacking ""human rights"", but their quality of life is matched by few peoples of the world, and none in Southeast Asia. The fact that it appears to be an example for the China ""communists"" gives me hope for the future of that country.",1234554811

When i started using twitter, i was skeptical that it would be of any value. But slowly i realize that it is much more powerful than i thought. It is like speaking on a stage where your followers are listening to you always.<p>By just putting in 10 or 15 mins of your day, you will be able to generate a lot of value from your twitter account. It is like a brand, better you tweet, more followers you have (how you utilize them depends on you).<p>Giving you an example, I have around 225 followers, so whenever i tweet a link, i get around 50 views. There are people with more followers like 1000 who i am assuming get around 250 views for every link they post. Mike Arrington has close to 25k - 30k followers, i am pretty much sure he get lot of traffic from twitter and he is also socializing with his users.",1234554139

480281,comment,480171,480252,0,0,larrywright,,,"I had the same feeling, initially. Here's what I've found though: there are really two kinds of relationships on Twitter. Allow me to elaborate.<p>On one end of the spectrum, I follow people who have similar interests as me (Ruby, Rails, Clojure, Arduino, Macs, etc). Lots of them are well-known in their various niche communities. Yes, you do get some degree of ""drinking coffe"" and ""walking the dog"" type of notifications, but a lot more ""hey, this piece of software is cool"", and ""I just released this new library"" messages. The signal to noise ratio is really pretty good, assuming you are choosy about who you follow. If you follow interesting people, they will help you find interesting things. I wrote about this a little bit, particularly about how I read RSS feeds much less now because of Twitter: <a href=""http://larrywright.me/blog/articles/209-the-coming-decline-of-rss-and-atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://larrywright.me/blog/articles/209-the-coming-decline-o...</a><p>On the other end of the spectrum, I do follow people that I know personally, or that live in the same town (it's small). What I get from these people is different. It's more akin to meeting down at the local coffee shop and catching up. There's value in this as well.<p>It's very easy to dismiss Twitter unless you look closely. You're right, in a sense: I don't care what a random person is doing right now. But that's not really what Twitter is about, and until you use it for a bit, that's hard to understand.<p>If you want to try it, find some people whose blogs you enjoy reading, and follow them for a bit on Twitter.

This is obviously the natural life cycle of internet forums, and has been since the beginning.<p>Story quality is directly linked to user growth. When you have a small niche site with ""niche-expert"" users, you get a high interest and visible actions; as the site grows, individual actions matter less, the niche is expanded into those that may only have a casual interest in the topic, and the forum inevitability changes to meet the needs of the average user - which <i>is not the same type of user that previously existed</i>. As the more windows are broken, the more ""decay"" is introduced into the forum. But the site is doing exactly what it's supposed to do - mirror the average demographic. It's that demographic that changes.<p>You simply cannot grow a website like this and maintain a niche focus. So if you choose to welcome more and more people, this is the end result. The sites that have been successful at maintaining focus control either the story submission (/.) or the entry of users (MeFi).<p>Sites like HN and reddit need to limit growth the same way a small startup shouldn't focus on growth per se if they want to retain that particular environment.<p>How to do this successfully is another problem altogether.",1234553296

I had a reporter friend who used to compare his job to working on the docks. Some fire would break out, and he'd be sent to ""unload"" the news from the fire department and the usual shocked-and-stunned families and the neighbors, and boom, file his story. And this was when newspapers were actually good.<p>By the 1990s, newspapers had virtually no useful content left. It was just a habit for some readers, and a local monopoly for certain forms of advertising. Newspapers had been consolidated to the point where local news was dreadful to non-existent, and most of the paper was filled with bland wire stories and syndicated columnists of no particular merit. The one thing you really needed the newspaper for was classified ads, and the internet killed that pretty quickly.<p>People are willing to pay more for actually rare information.

It's because Libertarian principles are just that: they're principles. They don't change per the circumstance, which is what makes Libertarianism such a robust ideology.<p>And as far as hearkening back to the 19th century, I'm curious as to what's so bad about that? The 19th century was a period of rapid growth for the US. A couple of ugly incidences excluded, things fiscal were generally Good.",1234552377

I don't check it, don't actively use it, and until I got the ability to parrot Tumblr posts, I didn't use it.<p>Reason being: Tumblr does everything I'd want to do with Twitter, but it's more flexible. I can write more, express myself. I don't see the point in small blurb updates, I don't care to post small, clever quips, and above all I find the interface bland after more than 5 minutes of usage. I tried Twitteriffic, but I had applications that do nothing but connect to the web.<p>EDIT: /unalone/",1234552331

A ""city"" is too much: a place to do business, a place to live alone, a place to explore, a place to retire, and so on and so on. Some of these measures are so critical that failure can be crippling. Thus, a city might compete for the attention of international organizations like banks and the Olympic committee... but <i>why</i>? What's the actual value exchange happening there and how does it play out in the details? (I'm not asking ""why should they"", but ""why are they"".)",1358891892
5099887,comment,5098800,5098800,4,0,arscan,,,"There are probably some value-adds you can do here, besides convenience for developers.  For example, you could save your users money by doing some creative aggregation of data points (assuming these services charge by volume) before sending them off.  Or you can try to detect low-value data points and let your users filter them out (like hits from bots).  Or you can do sampling so that only 1 out of every x data points goes through.  Yeah, in-house developers could code this up too, and it might completely kill the value of the analytics service by not sending all data, but who has the time to investigate these types of things?<p>Also, since switching analytics providers becomes very easy for your users, you can try to leverage this fact and get a kickback from analytics providers that you help convert your users to.  You could, theoretically, reduce the friction of moving to another provider to near zero (no development / integration cost, no data-lock in if your users let you store historic logs that you could replay to another provider, etc).  That would result in much more competitive pricing from the analytics providers.<p>edit: yeah, these random thoughts mostly apply to the server side stuff. just throwing them out there.",1358891877

5099857,comment,5098873,5098873,45,0,geophile,,,"My experience was quite different from that of OP, and I suspect most people who walk that path. I'm 56 in a few days, and got my PhD in computer science in 1983. I was lucky enough to go to a high school that had a real computer, a PDP-8M, and I was hooked five minutes after I sat down at the DecWriter.<p>At college, I was theoretically pre-med. A month into my freshman year (1974), I went to a party at the house of a revered EE professor, who happened to be a friend of the family. I was talking with someone, another professor, about my interest in computers, and he told me in no uncertain terms that there was no future in that. I was crushed. I was seriously bummed out for weeks. But it was what I loved to do, so I kept doing it, taking whatever courses were available, and hacking on my own projects.<p>I cleverly sabotaged all my medical school interviews. My interviewers were able to detect my lack of interest in medicine and my great enthusiasm about computers, and wisely rejected me.<p>I graduated, and wanting to do nothing but play with computers, I got a job in NYC, writing software, and because that wasn't enough, I also went to grad school at night. I decided to do a PhD because that seemed like the best way to keep playing with computers. My thought process was really that shallow. I wasn't thinking about industry vs. academe, future earning potential, or any other practical matters. I saw that I wouldn't finish my PhD while working, so I decided to do grad school full time.<p>I was lucky enough to choose McGill for grad school, after leaving New York. I sort of just fell into it, because I had gone there undergrad, I liked it, and my girlfriend was going there for medical school. I was lucky in the sense that it was perfectly suited to my personality. It wasn't a funding powerhouse, but between teaching and research funds, a student could support himself easily. My PhD adviser was a wonderful man, low-key, with some fun things he was investigating, but he wasn't building an empire, built on the backs of enslaved grad students. We were just looking at interesting problems together.<p>I graduated, and taught at UMass/Amherst for two years. And then it hit me. What a grad student was supposed to do, and what a faculty member was supposed to do. A faculty member starts building his empire, with insane focus on getting tenure. He or she gets tenure and builds a bigger empire, and spends an inordinate amount of time chasing funding. Grad students do the fun work, working very hard, for a very long time. I had no idea how to play this game, and no interest.<p>I left, and a few years later found myself at my first startup. It was similar to UMass. Instead of professors, there are entrepreneurs, insanely focused, and whose main job it is to get money to fund the work. Instead of grad students are the early employees, who make the vision real. I was much happier as an early employee, being a low-key introvert, who loves technical problems more than business problems. My PhD caused some large degree of distrust -- if I have that background, I'm obviously interested in writing academic papers more than writing software. But I still loved playing with computers, and startups are a great place to do that. I wrote a lot of software.<p>Epilogue: At my current startup, a number of our customers have a problem that happened to be exactly in the area of my PhD research. I spent a very enjoyable few weeks implementing my PhD thesis for these customers. 30 years later, my PhD ideas finally shipped.<p>tl;dr: I did a PhD to keep doing what I was drawn to. My career has been incredibly rewarding, and even charmed, and it is so atypical (I think) that I can't advise anyone to pursue a PhD based on my experience.",1358891655

The hard science and social science (my field) markets are far less dire than the humanities. As outlined in the original linked article, the process of getting your PhD is pretty brutal and you lose a lot of potential income on the years you are receiving a low graduate stipend. However, I would disagree with the author in the linked article--many graduate programs (especially in the US) do a very good job of providing graduate students with skills to complete a thesis. Schools are investing a lot of time and money into each graduate student and want them to succeed.<p>Once you make it through to the other side, the job market for recent PhDs is another thing all together. The recent recession has hit universities hard, especially public research institutions, and especially in the humanities. Therefore, only a very few graduates are able to secure tenure-track jobs (networking while you are a grad student helpsand hope for a lot of luck). This is often because so many applicants who have less appealing jobs (such as community college or non-tenure track jobs) are applying to the same tenure-track jobs as a recent graduate and have far more teaching and research experience.  If you get one of the less appealing jobs, you are generally given a very high teaching load and low pay, which harms your potential of producing more research to secure a better job. I would recommend reading through this page: <a href=""http://100rsns.blogspot.com/2011/04/55-there-are-too-many-phds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://100rsns.blogspot.com/2011/04/55-there-are-too-many-ph...</a> (and all of the reasons posted there).<p>All of that said, I was fortunate enough to receive a wonderful tenure-track job as a professor at a public research institution straight out of grad school. The job hunt was rough--I sent out an incredible number of applications over 6 months before I got a single interview. Persistence paid off, fortunately.<p>The PhD and academia are great if you can make it through the system. The system is rough. You really must be dedicated to your research and teaching to make it through. Also, FYI, the hours I work and stress levels as an academic dwarf those compared to when I was a higher-ed IT professional. Fortunately, I find this work far more rewarding. Try your best to get a seat at a relatively prestigious school in your field and be as productive as possible during those years.

5099562,comment,5098981,5098981,6,0,danabramov,,,"TL;DR: Reactive Programming  Sequence Comprehensions + Futures.<p>This looks pretty similar to a .NET library called Rx (Reactive Extensions). We're using it in a MonoTouch iOS app and I found it to solve some problems in a very convenient way. If you used functional style in your code, you know it shines in mapping/filtering/aggregating/reducing sequences of data. In .NET LINQ sequences have type of IEnumerable. You can think of Rx's IObservable as of IEnumerable's odd twin brother. The main difference is you IEnumerable is cold by its nature: it produces new items when you ask for them by calling MoveNext(). It doesn't do anything by its own. It's also synchronous.<p>IObservables, however, can both be cold and hot, i.e. they can yield items without being asked to. It's like IEnumerable but with don't call meI'll call you approach. Because of this, it doesn't have to be synchronous. Long processes that emit one item at a time, which may later be transformed, processed in batches, throttled, etc, benefit from being expressed via IObservable. The benefit I found is you can easily switch between different asynchronous data source implementations.<p>For example, it's trivial to write an IObservable wrapper around iOS Photo Library that will yield one item at a time. Then you can write a function that compares cached items in array with new items that arrive from photo library, and return IObservable of differences between cached and new data. Then you group those differences using built-in methods into batchesand feed them to UICollectionView so it can <i>animate the updates as the application receives them from system API</i>.<p>Then you just write another IObservable implementation for getting photos from Facebook, and wrap it in a function that will pre-fetch their thumbnails before yielding them. It is also an IObservable. You already implemented updating collection view, so you just plug in your new asynchronous data source and that's it.<p>Need to implement a Dropbox file picker? You already implemented collection view logic, diff logic and prefetching images, so you just need to wrap Dropbox folder fetch API in an IObservable, and merge IObservable-s from nested folders.<p>On top of that, you can add some caching, and magically it will work for any data source.",1358888527

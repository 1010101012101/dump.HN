4429585,comment,4428108,4429534,12,0,bcherry,,,"Lazy response, excerpted from a blog post[1]:<p>One particular weirdness and unpleasantry in JavaScript is the set of equality operators. Like virtually every language, JavaScript has the standard ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >= operators. However, == and != are NOT the operators most would think they are. These operators do type coercion, which is why [0] == 0 and ""\n0\t "" == 0 both evaluate to true. This is considered, by sane people, to be a bad thing. Luckily, JavaScript does provide a normal set of equality operators, which do what you expect: === and !==. It sucks that we need these at all, and === is a pain to type, but at least [0] !== 0.<p>[1]: Post from my blog, but I'm not linking to it because the rest is not useful to answer this question and I don't want to come across as a self-promoting-link-whore :)",1345841690

It highlights that if this is what I can come to expect from TechCrunch writers, then I don't care to visit it or ""launch"" through them. I would be pretty livid if a blogger decided to use my launch to get on his high horse about how he was too busy at other events to notice the breach [1].<p>Regardless of his evening plans, the other article would have come out. Regardless of his evening plans, the other article would have said <i>the exact same things</i> as his did. So what does that boil down to, that being a TechCrunch writer means you've got more of a right to that information than anyone else? Does that mean TechCrunch merely cares about being the blog equivalent of <i>FIRST!</i> rather than truly informative?<p>It's okay though, you got to slap an Exclusive on that linkbait title.<p>[1] Question: When I wrote for a tech/gaming blog, it was mandatory that we constantly made sure we looked at what other stories people had on the docket so that we didn't overlap them and so that if we found out any new information, we would alert them to it so they could add it before it was published. If the staff at TC loved this company so much and were so stoked to write on it, how did it take 12 hours on a 24 news cycle for someone to become aware of this breach? Could understand how that might happen on a smaller site, but surely a company like TC, that apparently needs these firsts to be relevant, should keep pretty constant tabs on the industry.",1345840289

Or do you want to own your own business?<p>I've had vaguely uncomfortable feelings about the app store concept on phones from the very beginning (and I've commented on those misgivings here on several occasions over the years, to mixed response), and I think all of the concerns I aired back then are coming to be proven to be real problems. When you sell an app via these stores, you don't have a customer...you have a sale. A customer is more valuable to a software developer than a sale by a <i>vast</i> amount. A few thousand customers can sustain a business indefinitely.<p>Customers can help you make your product better, and you can help your customer get more value out of the application (which means they'll be happy to pay you more). Customers can be rewarded for recommending your application to friends or coworkers. Customers can help support your product in your forums or support tracker. Customers can end up becoming your best employees (our first employee is someone who used our Open Source stuff for years, and was one of our first buyers when we created a commercial product; he's a true believer in what we do). A sale without that direct customer relationship is just a sale.<p>I have hopes that this is a temporary anomaly in an evolution toward a more open web with more direct connection between developers and users, but I don't have a very high level confidence in that outcome. But, I can encourage folks to not become sharecroppers, I guess.<p>About 15 years ago, there was a really common sentiment among tech industry titans that curating the web would be where money was made (which led to things like push content, and ""portals"", which mostly failed, or evolved), and this seems to be that same idea coming back in a new form. But, the curators are simply extracting value from developers and users without substantially improving the ecosystem...in fact, they're kinda bleeding the ecosystem dry, and enforcing a ""software-as-commodity"" model...it's Walmart applied to software. Which is a pretty dangerous situation, I think, for independent software developers, and probably only serves the largest corporations.",1345840261

The intention is not to disparage China in any way, but to frame the issue as an economic incentives problem, rather than pointing fingers.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>One issue I have heard from individuals much more familiar with the current Chinese culture than myself, is that the cultural revolution (communist legacy if you will), really disassociated the modern mainland culture from its roots and what you see if the ""off-shoots"", like Taiwan and Singapore.<p>The ethics, asporations, priorities, etc. that a person has, are all influenced by their surroundings and the culture that the family/environment holds. I saw this all too well in Russia in the 90s. The ""anything for a buck"" mentality is the core issue. In US/Western-derived cultures, as well as Singapore/Taiwan, you see boundaries put in place to restrain some this capitalistic drive. For example, in the old days, a man's word, was as good as a contract written on paper. You see this in many historic documents, such as British common law and it's influence on US legal system.<p>When the ""anything for a buck"" mentality sets in, your word is no longer that valuable. So naturally, you shift to other value-driving things, such as acquisition of monetary instruments and other ""stuff"". Means of said acquisition take second seat to acquisition itself. The apps in this case are the other ""stuff"" being acquired. How they are being acquired are irrelevant, so people doing the acquiring are taking the route of least resistance.<p>But this is not a China problem. Anyone remember the US financial crisis? Same basic problem - it was easy for consumers to consume beyond their means, and it made sales people richer. For a while, seemed like a win-win, until people needed to pay-up that is.<p>All of this is incentives problem. In US for example, you have much more incentive to ""play nice"" with the system, than going against it. For example, it's much more convenient for me to just buy the app. That ""convenience"" comes from a mix of ethical convictions and the fact that pirating takes time, which I am unwilling to invest, even IF I was ok with it, which I am not ok with stealing. From the economic view, the cost of stealing the app is much greater for me than someone else, so I make the rational choice of buying it and consuming for less.",1345838874

I believe copyright infringement is a subset of stealing. The common definition of stealing is taking something you don't own without permission. The fact that the owner still has a copy is immaterial. Acting like depriving the owner of their copy is a necessary component of stealing is just a remnant of a time where it was much harder to make perfect copy of valuable property. I know the copy vs. steal debate is touchy, but I also feel it is just a distraction from the larger issue.",1347325198

4503165,comment,4502154,4502754,5,0,da_n,,,"Having read more into the Marco/9-5Mac story and looking on Twitter, seems Marco has concluded the website does not want their content 'scraped' due to content in their articles being 'almost libelous'. Unfortunately he has taken the decision to block his users ability to save from the site as some sort of punishment against them. Can't see any real official explanation, and the error message is unhelpful. Unfortunately I cannot agree with his position, it is repugnant and seems to be a double standard (he has not blocked other sites which heavily criticise Instapaper). Shame, let's hope he sees sense.<p>Edit: he has lifted the block and apologised for putting it in place without the publishers explicit request, guess he saw sense in the end, everyone gets clouded by anger sometimes. <a href=""http://blog.instapaper.com/post/31303984531"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.instapaper.com/post/31303984531</a>",1347325115

4503156,comment,4502272,4502272,41,0,CodeMage,,,"While I understand what the author was trying to say, the argument is flawed in several ways.<p>First of all, as several people have already pointed out in their comments, not all companies are the same. Some companies place higher value on hard skills, some on soft skills. Most programmers will find their place somewhere. ""Rodrigos"" will fit better into a software/tech company, while ""Gabriellas"" will fit better into a company where software is just a necessity (e.g. a credit bureau).<p>Second, the whole ""Rodrigo and Gabriella"" example is not only contrived to support a flawed argument, it also features several inconsistencies that it conveniently sweeps under the carpet. For example, Gabriella is said to be ""able to explain complex technical issues quite clearly to clients"", yet ""she doesn't really grasp the concept of writing code that performs well"". The concept of writing code that performs well is a lot simple than ""complex technical issues"" you might need to explain to clients. Similarly, Rodrigo has risen to fame in open source community despite the fact that he is so inept at communication and teamwork that ""you can't get a clear thought out of him without rambling incoherence surrounding it.""<p>Third, the author states that ""a manager would rather work with Gabriella"" because ""managers are the ones who would have to deal with missed deadlines"". There's an assumption here that the fact that Gabriella ""introduces bugs that QA has to spend their time on"" would not lead to missed deadlines. I can attest, based on lots of personal experience, that in the companies that prefer to hire mostly ""Gabriellas"" the whole concept of success has been redefined so that nobody will mind the fact that the projects consistently miss deadlines and exceed the budget.<p>Fourth -- and I guess this is the one that hit my nerve -- the whole thing is presented as a matter of being able to impress managers ""to get jobs and promotions and raises and pats on the back"". Believe it or not, but some of us actually care more about producing software that does what the users/clients/customers need in the best possible way. Some of us are motivated by professional pride. We expect to get ""promotions and raises and pats on the back"" based on our merits, i.e. not because we're focused on impressing managers, but rather because we expect managers to be impressed by quality work.<p>Look, if you're slightly bitter about seeing ""programmers who are great employees but not great coders move to the top"", I can understand that. If you feel the need to rationalize about it, I can understand that, too. The problem is that you are offering your rationalizations as advice, without any regard for the effect it might have on shaping new generations of coders, such as teaching them it's okay to be a mediocre suck-up.",1347324981

To the best of my knowledge, Crossfit doesn't even sell contracts to people who haven't graduated from the six week intro class, which is a serious reality check for people who prefer to keep exercise in the realm of fantasy.  Thus, they weed out the best potential absentee customers before they can even buy a contract.  My instructor emails me when I skip class and then gives me shit about it (in a good-natured way, of course) when I show up for the next one.  Gyms love people who don't show up.  They only care who pays and who doesn't.  At Crossfit, they get grouchy if you pay and don't show up.  They literally complain about free money!  It's unfair to lump them in with the big box gyms whose business model depends on people not getting what they paid for.<p>It's true that my current facility requires a one-year contract to get the very best rates, which was a shock since my previous Crossfit facility only had one-month and three-month contracts, but that's nothing compared to big box gyms selling five-year memberships, offering guaranteed low monthly fees for a big one-time ""lifetime membership"" fee, and making it ridiculously hard to cancel recurring payments.  Also, there's zero sales pressure on contracts.

For example: a person who dies while standing on a NYC sidewalk and gets hit by a falling air conditioner is essentially blameless; a person who dies by being shot by a police officer while robbing a store at gunpoint earned their just reward.<p>Most situations, including this one, are less clear cut. She's not 0% responsible. She's not 100% responsible. But the correct number is somewhere in between. 5%? 10%? 20%? I don't know, and since I'm not presiding over a courtroom where she's suing 4chan, it's not my business to decide either.<p>In any case, to suggest that a person who <i>freely chooses</i> to venture into one of the seediest holes on the Internet, and then actively taunts and trolls the inhabitants (who are known to be vengeful, technically capable, and gifted with a lot of free time and tenacity) is absolutely and completely free from responsibility? ...

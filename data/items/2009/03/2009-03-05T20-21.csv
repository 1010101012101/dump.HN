Example: if the user's text includes the word ""why"", then reply ""Just because."", etc.<p>Advantages of using social networking for rule creation:<p>* Chatbot replies would be more relevant and rarely offensive -- they
have been approved by your friends after all.<p>* Encourages most people to actively participate in the creation
and/or forwarding of chatbot rules -- not just in chatting with bots.
If they don't, the chatbot(s) will have essentially nothing to say.<p>* Chatbot rule creation can be viewed as a simple form of programming and so this app might get more people interested in programming and computer science.",1236286558

John Schiefer was sentenced yesterday (3/4/09), and the story seemed to break today.<p>John was actually convicted for identity theft, fraud, and stealing bank account info. So the charges were pretty serious. Infoworld makes it sound like he just used the bank account info to pay for domain registration and web server space. It seems from the report the biggest victim was a company he scammed 19k out of for installing software on people's computers. So while it looks like the damage could have been a lot worse, the charges are very serious.<p>But anyway, for whatever reason, Jason decided to keep John on as an employee. People deserve second chances, so I'm willing to believe that John might be a good guy who just really screwed up. So I could accept that Jason might have good reason for keeping John on.<p>Since the story just broke, the information is pretty basic, and right now the only link between Mahalo and John is from Jason's blog. But of course that would change. Soon journalists are going to be mentioning that John was employed at Mahalo. And now Jason has taken charge of that bit of the story. He has been relatively open and defended his decision. So I see the blog has a good attempt to minimize the negative P.R. from John Schiefer getting convicted.<p>Info World:<a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/12/17/50FE-busted-botmen_7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/12/17/50FE-busted-botmen...</a>",1236286103

Schiefer stole random Paypal accounts and used them to buy things, and passed stolen Paypal accounts on to his acquaintances. What's the ""worse"" thing you can do with a botnet? At least the DDoS extortion botnets target gambling sites, and not your mom.<p>For that matter, I don't understand how Calacanis can equate what Schiefer did to the dumb things lots of teenagers do on computer networks (and, for that matter, on conference room floors). Schiefer wasn't a ""hacker"". He's a carder.<p>(As a side-note to Calacanis: sniffing people's passwords at conferences? Also illegal!)<p>Calacanis says Schiefer was supervised in his work at Mahalo. Is there someone who isn't supervised there? I don't understand how Mahalo believes they had the capability to supervise someone who can manage a 250,000-host botnet.<p>Unfortunately, I do understand why Calacanis thinks he doesn't handle sensitive information. He doesn't see the link between tens of thousands of email-password pairs and those people's bank accounts. Just a wild guess, but I'm thinking the guy who steals the Paypal accounts out of bot-infected Windows boxes can make that leap.<p>This is just such a weird post.

504703,comment,504660,504660,0,0,ggchappell,,,"I would say this article is discussing two separate problems: (1) the gulf between research and practical software development, and (2) low-quality C.S. graduates.<p>IMHO, the first is not really a problem, or at least not a big one. Part of the way a field advances is that researchers are free to try out any old idea, to see if it is any good. Most of them aren't, but we don't know which are worthwhile until we try them out. So it helps that researchers are disconnected from the process of making salable products. ""Make something that sells in two months"" is not a good way to get people to try out interesting new ideas.<p>The result is a slow filtering of ideas from research into practice. Occasionally, a university researcher comes up with something that the programmer on the street can immediately pop into a product (RSA encryption, bump mapping, Introsort, ...) but this is not the norm; nor, I think, should we expect it to be.<p>The second problem (low-quality C.S. graduates) is more serious. The writer's suggestions are not particularly new; they amount to putting more of what is often called ""software engineering"" into the C.S. curriculum. And part of the problem there is that it is difficult to do large projects in a university course setting. When you don't do large projects, all that stuff (teams, complexity management, ...) is not really needed. So, while this second problem is worth pointing out, I don't think there are going to be any quick fixes for it.",1236285337

504687,comment,504412,504412,0,0,cjoh,,,"Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure of meeting and working with Vivek Kundra in his job as the CTO of Washington, DC. Today he was today he was appointed to the new position of CIO of the Federal Government. He's a visionary -- a leader in the field of eGovernment who understands that technology can be used to change the way government operates, can be used to save money, as a way to inform citizens -- all for the sake of our democracy for its citizens. From my interactions with him it is clear he believes in three things:<p>1. Using Alternative Market Models to Reduce Cost<p>A great example of an alternative market model is [Apps for Democracy](<a href=""http://appsfordemocracy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appsfordemocracy.org</a>), the project that he did with [iStrategyLabs](<a href=""http://istrategylabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://istrategylabs.com</a>) to get lots of ideas and applications developed for the District of Columbia for a pittance. While Kundra didn't invent the contest model, he was the first person inside the Government to use it, and it was a smart move. Not only does it reduce the cost of building early apps, it raises awareness and identifies talent. While I suspect the operations of the Government will not be supplanted by running a bunch of contests, I suspect we'll see some significant cost savings through contest models and open source development.<p>2. Data driven decisions<p>Kundra's into [using markets](<a href=""http://www.nascio.org/awards/2008Awards/portfolioManagement.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nascio.org/awards/2008Awards/portfolioManagement....</a>) to make data driven decisions. I took a tour of his DC CTO office a few months ago and he showed me his ""trading floor"" of Government projects. Flat panel screens of DC OCTO projects, their cost, their milestones, the teams associated with them and a big score. Scores were associated with names as well as projects, helping Kundra make decisions about how likely a project was to succeed, and find inefficiencies. Each project was given a ""buy"", ""sell"", or ""hold"" rating which helped Kundra make decisions on whether or not to continue projects.<p>3. Operational Data is Public Data<p>Perhaps his most profound move is to recognize that there should be no difference between the data that government useS to make decisions and the  data available to the public. Government obviously needs to protect some information-- we all agree that, for instance, there shouldn't be a feed of everybody's social security numbers. But Kundra’s understanding that there is no sense in creating a ""public data source"" and an ""operational data source"" is revolutionary.<p>Another interesting thing about Kundra in his DC role is that unlike many government agencies, Kundra had developers working for him rather than contractors or outside firms. His research and development team in DC was led by [Dmitry Kachaev](<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrykachaev"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitrykachaev</a>)  a man with real technical skill who worked full time for the Government.<p>If Kundra can push all three of these philosophies inside of the Government, we're in for a lot of change. It isn't exactly going to be easy. The federal government has a lot more inertia in it than the District of Columbia. But I suspect you can look for some strong shifts very soon. If I was a developer looking for a job, I'd be scouring USAJobs.gov for opportunities in Office of Management and Budget or perhaps the newly created Office of the Federal CIO. We'll see where the legal home is of this new position. Some very interesting things are about to happen.",1236284657

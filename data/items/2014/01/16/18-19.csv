Space and memory are cheap, so either encoding seems fine.<p>The bottom line is that UTF-8 is awkward to use on Windows, while UTF-16/wchar_t is awkward to use on Linux, simply because the core APIs make them so (there is no _wfopen  function in glibc).",1389898755

But as I wrote, a lack of an understanding of biology isn&#x27;t the problem; the problem is a disregard for empirical evidence. If a presidential candidate has no regard for empirical evidence in the context of biology, they likely have no regard for empirical evidence in the context of other subjects, including important subjects such as health economics. That&#x27;s the problem.<p>So while you&#x27;re correct that a person can lack an understanding of biology and still be successful, a successful person who has little regard for empirical evidence is a threat to civilization.",1389898704

7071647,comment,7063331,7068513,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"In this particular case (bad data from disk, without an error indication from the disk) is pretty straight forward programming. If the device doesn&#x27;t allow for additional check bits in the sectors, then reserving one sector out of 15 or one out of 9 (say if you&#x27;re doing 4K blocks) for check data on the other sectors will let you catch misbehaving drives, and, if necessary, reconstruct bad data with the RAID parity.<p>If you use a 15/16ths scheme you only &quot;lose&quot; a bit more than 7% of your drive to check data, and you gain the ability to avoid really nasty silent corruption. I&#x27;m not sure why even a &quot;consumer&quot; RAID solution wouldn&#x27;t do that (even the RAID-1 folks (mirroring) can use this for a bit more protection, although the mean-bit-error spec still bites them in trying to do a re-silver)<p>As for Google, If you&#x27;d like to understand the choice they made (and may un-make) you have to look at the cost of adding an available disk. The &#x27;magic&#x27; thing they figured out was they were adding lots and lots of machines, and most of those machines had a small kernel, a few apps, and some memory, and an unused IDE (later SATA) port or ports. So adding another disk to the pizza box was &quot;free&quot; (and if you look at the server in the Computer History Museum you will see they just wrapped a piece of velcro around the disk and stuck it down next to the motherboard on the &#x27;pizza pan&#x27;.) In that model an R3 system which takes no computation (its just copying, no ECC computation) with data &quot;chunks&quot; (in the GFS sense) which had built in check bits) and voila &quot;free&quot; storage. And that really is very cost effective if you have stuff for the CPUs to do, it breaks down when the amount of storage you need exceeds what you can acquire by either adding a drive to a machine with a spare port, or replacing all the drives with their denser next generation model. Steve Kleiman the former CTO of NetApp used to model storage with what he called a &#x27;slot tax&#x27; which was the marginal cost of adding a drive to the network (so fraction of a power supply, chassis, cabling, I/O card, and carrier (if there was one)). Installing in pre-existing machines at Google the slot tax was as close to zero as you can reasonably make it.<p>That said, as Googles storage requirements exceeded their CPU requirements it became clear that the cost was going to be an issue. I left right about that time, but since that time there has been some interesting work at Amazon and Facebook with so called &quot;cold&quot; storage, which are ways to have the drive live in a datacenter but powered off most of the time.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with this statement, <i>&quot;No, RAID is for withstanding disk failures, where the disk fails in a predicted manner.&quot;</i> mostly because disks have never failed in a &quot;predicted manner&quot;, that is what Garth Gibson invented RAID in the first place, he noted all the money DEC and IBM were spending on trying to make an inherently unreliable system reliable, and observed if you were willing to give up some of the disk capacity (through redundancy, check bits) you could take inexpensive, unreliable, drives, and turn them into something that was as reliable as the expensive drives from these manufacturers. It is a very powerful concept, and changed how storage was delivered. The paper is a great read, even today.",1389898684

Everyone knows they&#x27;re deceptive and a halfway decent photographer with a wide-angle lens can make a 1-bd hovel look like a mansion.<p>When have you heard someone say &quot;The place was <i>so</i> much better than the photos!&quot;? Not often. That&#x27;s a problem for a 3D experience in a few ways:<p>1) if the 3D experience is pitched as &quot;more true to life&quot;, then no buyers will think that the house <i>could be</i> better than the experience presents.<p>2) if the 3D experience doesn&#x27;t capture the greatness of a property, the buyer/viewer would be underwhelmed vs. seeing the place in person. Properties with spectacular views for example would take a hit because that emotional experience of &quot;I could wake up to this every day&quot; is replaced with a 1-dimentional texture.<p>3) If the 3D experience is <i>too</i> good, buyers will be disappointed when seeing the property in real life.<p>IMO sales like this -- houses, cars -- are a visceral experience that require in-person shopping. That&#x27;s why internet car sales haven&#x27;t really taken off. You really have to take the house for a &quot;test drive&quot;, see how you think your furniture would fit, imagine your kids playing in the yard, all that stuff.<p>Now if you were making some kind of holodeck... ;)",1389898640

Just like this article says, the employee has already decided to leave once, it&#x27;s not going to take alot to get them to decided to leave again.  In addition, though, counter-offering one employee signals to others that they can route around the usual process for promotions and raises by coming in with an offer of their own.<p>I worked at a place where they counter-offered two above average (but not great) developers who were working on an important client project.  The two accepted the counter-offers, but still left for good in a few months.

7071614,comment,7071208,7071208,35,0,zeidrich,,,"I think that an important step is to pre-empt the counter-offer.<p>When you even start to consider another opportunity, think about why you actually want to move to the new opportunity.  Is it that you need more money? Is it that you want to work on a different kind of project? Is it that you need more stimulation?<p>Then go to your employer, and without bringing up the other opportunity, see if they are willing to make the change that you want.  Don&#x27;t be angry that they haven&#x27;t already done it for you, until this point you didn&#x27;t even necessarily know you wanted it, you can&#x27;t expect them to.<p>If they accept, then you are in an environment where you&#x27;re happy, and your employer is probably happy that you are motivated and taking steps to make things happen.  If they reject your offer, then pursue the better opportunity.<p>In that case, if they do give you a counter-offer, it&#x27;s either going to be less than you need, which makes it easy enough to say no to.  Or they will be offering you the same thing you&#x27;ve already asked for and declined to provide, which means they are doing it out of desperation and you can expect they will to an extent resent it if they feel it&#x27;s something they can&#x27;t afford, or they will have been actively trying to take advantage of you by denying you fair treatment when you asked for it directly.<p>I think first decide what it is you need, then give your employer the opportunity to provide what it is you need of their own accord, then accept an offer with another employer who can provide what it is you need.  Then you don&#x27;t have to worry about the counter-offer. You&#x27;ve already gone through it once on your terms.<p>If you don&#x27;t make your employer aware that you want a change prior to your resignation, and they would have been willing to offer it to you all along if they knew, you&#x27;re both in an awkward position.  If the counter offer is exactly what you want and you take it, there will be some soreness and a passive-aggressive attitude that will persist.  If you ask for what you want and get it prior to saying &quot;Or else I quit&quot; it&#x27;s much smoother sailing for everyone.",1389898454

In retrospect, this can seem rather surprising (if not off-putting) to newcomers, so an argument can be made that a more conservative default behavior should have been chosen (like the more &quot;hard-nosed&quot; behavior of standard dicts in Python).<p>OTOH Perl people tend to like the way we can, for example, create histograms (and nested structures like graphs) a bit more fluently with autovivifying hashes, e.g.:<p><pre><code>    my %a;\n    for my $x (@x)  { $a{$x}++ }\n</code></pre>\nthan if we always had to be saying<p><pre><code>    if (exists $a{$x})  {\n        $a{$x}++\n    }\n    else  {\n        $a{$x} = 0\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOr as Perlistas would be more prone to write (if forced to use a non-vivifying hash):<p><pre><code>    exists $a{$x} ? $a{$x}++ : { $a{$x} = 0 }\n</code></pre>\nOr gosh, who knows:<p><pre><code>    $a{$x} = exists $a{$x} ? $a{$x}+1 : 0\n</code></pre>\nOr to have sat around and waited for 10 years or so until Hash::Util was invented (after Perl 4&#x27;s initial release), provided then you knew to look for it, and how), at which point you&#x27;d finally be able to say:<p><pre><code>    use Hash::Util &#x27;unlock_keys&#x27;;\n</code></pre>\nBut as it happens, when Perl 4 first came out, autovivification (and its cohort, promiscuous ducktyping) were chosen as the default behavior for many of the language&#x27;s core constructs (not just hashes and arrays).  It&#x27;s just the way Perl rolls.  Whether it&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; tradeoff to make or not, from a socio-engineering perspective, is an interesting question (and partially a matter of taste).

Every nation with a vested interest is involved in spying internationally, and although all these nations also have vast domestic intelligence operations, I believe that some nations are more actively focused on gathering information on their own citizens for specific purposes than others.<p>I can only speak from my opinions and what I&#x27;ve read, but it is my belief that the NSA is more of the former, interested more in international affairs while still maintaining a catch-all domestic program with the intention of gathering as many intelligence signals as possible, though not actively pursuing 98% of what&#x27;s been gathered. Granted, if they wanted to take action against an individual they damn well have the capacity, but I don&#x27;t think this is their primary objective. I do believe genuinely that &quot;preventing terrorism&quot; is one of their aims (or at least giving the state the resources to do so), but obviously the tools that are being used to fulfill these goal are taken to their logical extent and ping everyone instead of &quot;the bad guys&quot;.<p>When I look at other nations and see very obvious programs of state-sponsored espionage (China&#x27;s Unit 61398, for example) I wonder how far the United States would eventually fall behind in the game if they don&#x27;t keep pace with other nations. The NSA&#x27;s operations have less to do with corporate espionage (as far as anyone can tell) or political dissent (somewhat), but cyber warfare is a very real threat and having the capacity to monitor that threat and actively work against it is a power I hope the agency doesn&#x27;t lose.<p>I hear and accept the argument of intelligence powers being used to ultimately instill tyranny, and I grapple with reasoning defense of the state&#x27;s interests vs. living under tyranny (not to mention protecting my own self interests), but I don&#x27;t know if we are realistically at that point yet and I still would argue that there is an importance to letting the state manage its own affairs. That is a flawed argument obviously but that is one of the reason I wanted to hash out the topics in my initial question.<p>I agree that the next few years will present a privacy arms race in the private sector and I hope those technologies would be able to combat the over-reach of any agency with intelligence gathering capabilities but I hesitate to believe it will hamper these agencies abilities to monitor and track individuals. I hope I&#x27;m wrong, but the cat and mouse game of technological advancement will continue unabated, and as long as the USA continues to spend more than half a trillion dollars annually on defense the resources will always be available to break or hinder those advancements.

7071476,comment,7069441,7070639,2,0,araes,,,"Many of the &quot;Who&quot; -> &quot;Americans&quot; call / responses I believe.  However, it feels like correlation without causation.  Yes, statistically, the majority of Americans are self-interested actors who vote as individuals, not as well meaning members of a greater whole.  They&#x27;re people.  But so are the voters in most other representative governments.  I would instead say that they are just the logical developed state of a nation that extols Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness (all very individual goals) while situating them in a place with a very rapid, capitalistic feedback loop that gives carrots for highly self-interested choices, and sticks for choices which benefit the larger social group.<p>This will be a bit of a stretch, but nations are kind of like equation solvers.  You start with ICs (form of government, economic views, population diversity), BCs (neighbours, trade, media), source terms (research,  development, legal activism) , ect... and then start moving through time, trying to solve for a converged social state that&#x27;s stable.  Some of that junk just isn&#x27;t stable and diverges spectacularly.  Some are only locally stable, so you get periodic upheaval.  And some are stable solutions and converge well.  Almost every IC for America is one that favors absolute personal freedom over the welfare of the group.  Our government rewards people for thinking locally and voting in their self interest.  Our economic model is one which absolutely rewards people on self-interest.  The idea model (touted here and elsewhere) is to develop the minimal effort product, market it extensively, build a loyal following, and then go public so that early backers / founders can cash out.  At which point...who cares?  Next big project and the public can get soaked.  Even our population distribution favors it.  &quot;The land of bounty and opportunity where anyone with enough determination and drive can be a millionaire!&quot; what kind of folks is that going to attract?<p>And like I said, it all converges.  The media used to balance some of this, but as the iterations have continued, the bankruptcies, the buyouts, and the new investors, they&#x27;ve gotten more infected, to the point where they&#x27;re now largely just mouthpieces for whatever self-interested individual or group speaks through them.<p>Are we divergent?  Hard to tell.  We could be a convergently stable Rome, stagnating as we develop ever more robust home tofu delivery visualizations.  With the core of extreme individualism, we could theoretically be explosively divergent.  However, I&#x27;m hoping for locally stable, so that we can get enough upheaval to kick us over the nearby hill and maybe find a better minima, where we once again aren&#x27;t risk averse, dare to build big projects that change the world, and possess a government that does more than go into spasmodic seizures every two months.",1389897468

I&#x27;m talking about choosing to believe differently about things for which science does have an answer, or at least a strong suggestion.<p>There&#x27;s a subtle distinction I&#x27;m trying to make between &quot;true&quot; and &quot;scientifically proven&quot;. Equating the two requires a belief that what science discovers is absolute truth, but that meta-claim cannot be analyzed by the underlying tool of science.<p>One can easily conceive of example theories which are not scientifically testable. Let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that the universe was supernaturally created out of nothing. Not 6000 years ago, but at UNIX timestamp 0. But everyone was created with memories. Objects were created in motion. Everything is exactly as we see it, with cause and effect stretching back for countless million years, but it actually was just all created looking that way. As absurd as this sounds, <i>it isn&#x27;t scientifically falsifiable</i>. It can&#x27;t be disproven.<p>Assuming the above scenario is <i>true</i>, it is still <i>scientifically proven</i> that the universe is unfathomably old. The natural, empirical explanation does not change. It simply becomes false while remaining scientifically valid. The science is still sound. (And assuming the universe was not in fact created at UNIX timestamp 0, the belief that it was is still <i>false</i> even if it isn&#x27;t disprovable.)<p>The rationalist believes that the findings of science are absolute truth. That if the universe appears billions of years old, it&#x27;s because it <i>is</i> billions of years old. But whether observation is proof of absolute truth is not a testable question in science. Science can&#x27;t assert absolute truth in that way. It can only assert a sound, natural explanation of cause and effect. And just because everything <i>has</i> a sound, natural explanation of cause and effect doesn&#x27;t mean those are explanations are <i>true</i>. We simply have no way of knowing whether the entire universe was created at UNIX timestamp 0 with everything exactly as it should have been to make it appear billions of years old.",1389897342

In some cases landlords hire them because they don&#x27;t want to deal with the process themselves, and in some cases the brokers will re-list apartments they find on Craigslist or other websites to make it seem like they have an exclusive listing, then try to get you to pay their fee if you rent the apartment. In almost all cases, the renter winds up having to pay the broker fee of one month rent to as high as 15% of the annual rent. Finding a no-fee rental is extremely rare. I would love to have a transparent system that was easy enough to use for landlords/management companies that resulted in two things:<p>1) Owners don&#x27;t feel the need to retain brokers to deal with prospective tenants, passing the ridiculously high bill onto them.\n2) The market for these no-value-adding middleman brokers that re-list no-fee apartments and other brokers&#x27; listings dries up.<p>I believe that the only case that a renter should have to pay a broker fee is if the renter him/herself retains the broker to show them apartments because they don&#x27;t want to do the work.<p>/rant",1389896780

On top of all that, you get asshole states like Nevada bussing homeless people to places like San Francisco[1] (SF is actually suing the state of Nevada for this).<p>Now granted, the way _anywhere_ in the US treats their homeless and mentally ill is not particularly &quot;socially aware&quot;, but looking at SF&#x27;s relatively large homeless population and assuming that it comes from a relative lack of social awareness is a completely wrong-headed approach.<p>[1] <a href""http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/11/2602391/san-francisco-sues-nevada-patient-dumping"" rel""nofollo"">http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/11/2602391/san-franc...</a>",1389896641

Look up Bell&#x27;s Theorem (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell&#x27;s_theore"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell&#x27;s_theorem</a>).  It has been experimentally verified countless times and necessitates that &quot;one is forced to reject locality, realism, or freedom&quot;.  &quot;Freedom&quot; meaning something specific in a scientific sense.  Rejecting the last one implies something called superdeterminism, which is basically just determinism (the &quot;super&quot; implies that everything that exists is deterministic; there are no random components).  Gerard t&#x27;Hooft is one of the only legit physicists left who supports a superdeterministic theory.  Almost all other physicists believe that a measurement of a quantum state collapses it into a random eigenstate.<p>For me personally, were superdeterminism found to be true (although it&#x27;s looking more likely that&#x27;s not going to be the case) it wouldn&#x27;t bother me in the slightest, and I don&#x27;t see a conflict between determinism and free will.  Imagine someone creates a movie.  They decide the plot -- what happens and when.  They decide the setting, the number of characters, and everything else about the movie.  Then when you play the movie, everything that occurs is predetermined -- deterministic in a sense -- yet it was freely chosen <i>outside</i> the realm of the movie.

The language has full support for OOP, it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;re not expected to trot it out except when you&#x27;re writing public interfaces that are meant to be consumed by code that might be written in C# or VB.NET.  So the List class mostly sticks to static methods in its public interface because that approach fits better with traditional functional idioms.<p>That gets you as far as something like this:<p><pre><code>  List.sum (List.filter isEven [1;2;3;4])\n</code></pre>\nThe next step is the &quot;pipeline&quot; operator, which is defined as<p><pre><code>  let inline (|>) x f = f x\n</code></pre>\nSo it&#x27;s just letting you swap a function and its argument, which facilitates reorganizing the code so that the functions are listed in the order in which they execute.  That&#x27;s what gets you to the example you give - or better yet:<p><pre><code>  [1;2;3;4]\n  |> List.filter isEven\n  |> List.sum\n</code></pre>\nwhich I think captures some of the natural expression that you were talking about while still sticking with functional idioms instead of object-oriented ones.",1389895666

How can the author even be asking this question?<p>Here&#x27;s a basic outline.  It feels weird typing this because it should be obvious, but here goes.<p>Northern California cities are cities just like any other.  There are people of all income levels doing all sorts of different jobs, or not doing any jobs.  There are a disproportionate number of tech workers in that region, but other than that it&#x27;s pretty much the same as anywhere else.  People are still people are still people.  The reason a shirtless man randomly punched you is because he was crazy.  The more people you have concentrated in a small area, the more likely you are to meet up with a crazy person when you&#x27;re walking down the street (that&#x27;s just statistics/probability).  I live in NYC, a much bigger city, and I see crazy people all the time.  When you see someone not wearing a shirt in public, babbling or shouting, hanging around on a street corner by themselves, etc., etc., they are most likely crazy.  If you see a crazy person, stay as far away from them as possible and do not make eye contact.  Definitely do not engage with them in any way (this includes taking pictures of them) because it will provoke them.  Welcome to city life!",1389895621

Also, I am failry confident that I could teach my children (yes I have them) better than public schools in quite a few subjects.<p>Nonetheless, I am glad that public education is compulsory here.<p>Forcing all children to go to the same schools is essential if you want children to have equal opportunities in life.<p>1. It gives the children coming from disfunctional households a chance to escape and a chance to be helped.<p>2. It guarantees that the child recieves an education that has a certain basic level in a broad range of subjects, independently of what the parents find relevant or interesting. I bet there are quite a few parents or future parents on this site who think that teaching children about art or literature is a waste of time. There are also people out there who think the same about history or math.<p>3. Children recieve an education from people that are associated with education. Not only will uncomfortable subjects such as the Holocaust (very central to education in Germany) or sexual education be covered, but they will also be taught by teachers whose relation to the children is free of all the emotional baggage of the relation between children and their parents.<p>4. Children need to socialize with other children<p>5. In public school, children &quot;see&quot; the part of society that their parents would like to ignore, be it out of ideological reasons or out of conveniende. If you are a person who leads a good life, free of the problems that plague the society you live in, you are very likely to either shield your children, or unknowingly only expose them to the bubble in which you live. Both things are bad for the children and even worse for society as a whole.<p>Regarding your last point: There should normally be enough time out of school to improve on the education that the children receive in the fields that you deem more important. It might well be that through public education we lose some outcome in one potential &quot;megabrain&quot; or two, but the overall gain for society that comes from improvement &quot;at the bottom&quot; IMO far outweighs that. Also, the smart kids usually find a way to dig into what interests them, even if you can push them along only a little.",1389895612

It was great, and the team that started it --- two Big-5 accounting firm programmers --- was inspiring, particularly when it came to business strategy.<p>Anyways, very early on, EnterAct managed to maneuver into a reputation for premium customer support. We got that reputation by doing some concrete things differently than our competitors: we staffed an appropriate number of CSRs, trained them to be nice to customers, did a lot of gratuitous tech support for basic computer problems, and were flexible about resolving billing disputes. Sadly, a lot of those things were differentiators at the time. A couple years in and we were essentially able to hang &quot;best customer support&quot; on our list of features, and eventually we became the most popular ISP in Chicago largely based on that.<p>But something I came to notice pretty quickly: the things we were doing to earn that support reputation stopped being empirical differentiators pretty quickly. Our largest competitor, run by Karl Denninger, did us a continuing series of favors by pissing off their customers. But other large regional ISPs pretty quickly learned not to set fire to their customer base, and, by the end, I think our customer service was pretty much at par for the whole area; we were no longer truly different based on support. The reputation, however, never left.<p>That observation has stuck with me for my entire career. I think about it all the time. It&#x27;s banal, I know: &quot;early impressions count a lot&quot;, but there&#x27;s a little more to it than that: you can weaponize an early impression by turning it into your market positioning and having some message discipline.<p>I left EnterAct for a job in Calgary with a company called Secure Networks (SNI), doing development and security research. For the year prior to leaving EnterAct, I had also been working with the OpenBSD project, mostly by writing all their security advisories, but also doing a bit of part-time security research. SNI operated the world&#x27;s first commercial vulnerability research team, and had a very close relationship with Theo; we had a full time employee who had essentially led the first OpenBSD security audit. I went drinking with Theo many times, and vividly remember hanging out in his basement with Tim Newsham eating bad pizza and trying to find vulnerabilities in Daniel Bernstein&#x27;s qmail (we found one that would work if integers were 128 bits, but ironically missed the LP64 bugs that Georgi Guninski found; it was 1997, though).<p>This is all a long prelude to a simple point, which is that I think OpenBSD&#x27;s reputation for security works in a very similar way to how EnterAct&#x27;s reputation worked. OpenBSD started doing something very different than FreeBSD, Linux, and (particularly) NetBSD: they did an OS-wide audit for vulnerabilities, and aggressively fixed apparent bugs whether or not we could demonstrate that they were exploitable. That was a great move. But it was so obviously great that pretty much everyone (with the possible exception of NetBSD) quickly adopted the practice.<p>Among security research insiders, OpenBSD&#x27;s reputation became a little bit farcical. Not that OpenBSD was comically insecure --- it wasn&#x27;t --- but that its reputation so far outstripped its actually differentiation. People found a bunch of vulnerabilities in OpenBSD and laughed as the claim at the top of the OpenBSD changed from &quot;no vulnerabilities&quot; to &quot;no remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in the default install&quot;.<p>And at some point in the last 10 years, didn&#x27;t OpenBSD&#x27;s distro servers get owned up?<p>I&#x27;m sure the OpenBSD project would like its threat model to include NSA. But OpenBSD is not a meaningful ally in a contest between you and NSA. NSA wins that fight. OpenBSD&#x27;s userland was much stronger than FreeBSD&#x27;s in 1999, but I&#x27;m not sure I think their kernel is stronger in 2013, and that&#x27;s probably what matters more.<p>Let me wind this bloviation up with a caveat: one thing a reputation for security gets you is a feed of talent that is interested in working on security problems. OpenBSD certainly got that. So for instance, OpenBSD&#x27;s developers designed and built privilege-separated OpenSSH. There is a lot of good security work that has started inside the OpenBSD project, and I don&#x27;t mean to talk any of that stuff down. I&#x27;d just be careful about taking the project&#x27;s overall reputation to the bank, especially if you have serious adversaries.<p>Sorry for hanging this sprawling comment off your (simpler) point; I just don&#x27;t want the root comment on the thread to be me talking down OpenBSD.",1389895443

First of all, installing Haxe with Haxelib was dirt simple, but what I like is it seems to always resolve dependencies properly, its easy to upgrade single packages, grab dev versions, or upgrade all your libraries at once.

If the corporate world does not see the benefit, then there is no hurry to chuck what they currently have in favor of the new stuff, no matter how good. \nI personally like Win 8/8.1, (I admit, not for the Metro stuff) especially since I am a developer. The out of the box availability of Hyper-V seems super cool to me. It is so easy to build up new VMs (both Win and Linux). Also, you can boot directly off of a VHD VM, which is also pretty cool.<p>As I said, it is the business side of things that slows down the adoption in the corporate world.

For example, if we recommend something to Alex because Bob likes it, but Alex doesn&#x27;t trust Bob&#x27;s judgement, then Alex might reject the recommendation even if in practice she always enjoys the same things as Bob, she just doesn&#x27;t realise it.<p>On the other hand, collecting feedback about whether the user agreed with the way the recommendation is made might be helpful in improving the way it works.<p>Definitely something to think about though.",1389895246

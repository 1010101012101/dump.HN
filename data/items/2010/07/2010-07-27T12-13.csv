Don't look at hte formulas or the proofs, just look at the problem space itself.<p>You have a circle with radius=1 centered in (0,0). Draw a line from the center of the circle to any point in the circle. Now you build a triangle using this line as your hypotenuse. Inmediately, you will see that the heigth and the width of the triangle will be in (-1, 1). That is why -1 <= sen(x) <= 1 and -1 <= cos(x) <= 1. You can see that your triangle is always a rigth triangle so you can apply Pitagoras. That is why sen^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1. Keep thinking about it for a few weeks and you will realize that all the formulas you memorized in high school are just common sense, you can deduce all of them just by drawing a circle with a triangle in your mind.<p>Try to do the same with other stuff (set theory is a good second thing to look at). You will discover that math notation is just notation and that many proofs (at high school level) are just common sense written in a very formal language.<p>Think about what the maths are about, not about formulas or notation.",1280234852

(I'm assuming you're using LuaSocket, though that's not entirely clear.)<p>As with select(2) in general, this doesn't scale up past 100ish idle sockets - it has to do a full scan over all sockets to check which are ready for IO, and the latency eventually dominates. (Not a big deal for most uses, but problematic for web applications.) If that's not an issue, though, it's quite easy. Lua is very underrated, IMHO.<p>I'm working on a Lua library (octafish) for doing libev + coroutine and/or callback-based servers.

If you're lucky enough to do something as basic as parsing URIs or JSON, you have, but normally not.<p>Writing a recursive descending parser isn't hard, as you said, but it's again something that needs testing, you need put some effort into it to get good error messages from it - and why would you repeat such a task? Also you often need to write a lexer -- another burden of which Perl 6 grammars free you.<p>Regarding your thoughts about abstract languages: Perl 6 provides tools to make experimenting with them rather easy, which helps learning about them.<p>I've made the experience that a reasonably good programmer can write some 20 lines of Perl code, and it does what he wants. That doesn't imply that he can write a 20 lines grammar that does what he wants, without doing some debugging and corrections first.<p>Writing grammars is a skill that just has to be learned, line any other skill too.

1550943,comment,1550827,1550827,0,0,cvore,,,"When I came out of high-school some years ago I had the same problem. I really wanted to learn the math needed to do 3d-programming so I could to do fancy demo-scene stuff (see www.scene.org), but the high-school level math just didn't cut it and I didn't manage to learn it by my self. I started at a university to study CS, and took some calculus courses there. It was a fairly advanced calculus course which focused on proofs, and I worked really hard on it through cooperation with others and the help of great teachers. Although this experience lead me to end up doing a PhD in math, it was this first more advanced mathematical experience which made me able to really _get_ it. It took a lot of hard work, and after helping some younger people with high-school level stuff, I now see that the math-books at this level often suck. The ""proofs"" are more heuristic justifications that unfortunately often simply hide the real point of what is going on. My advice would be to take a proof-oriented math-course at university level. Even if the curriculum is not the math you would like to learn (for example a calculus course might be ideal even though you would like to do discrete math stuff for CS), I do not think that mathematical maturity needed to go on by your self is possible to get in any other way (except if you are a genius).",1280232687

Basically, it really does speed things up.  It takes a couple months being fast tracked.  This was amazingly helpful.  Removing the expediency only means that to get a visa, you need to get approval from an additional agency.  Basically, it makes sure that the company offering you the job can't realistically fill your position with a local person.  The idea is to ask ""Why can't you fill this position with a Canadian?""  This makes sense.<p>We went through that this last time, mostly through miscommunication, and the process was still very painless.  It helps if you are specialized in a certain industry.  You also need some form of degree in the field you are being hired for.  Part of the reason I encourage people to continue their education and to make it clear self-taught doesn't open as many doors as education.<p>In the end, obtaining a Canadian visa is a straight forward process.  The only assistance available covers everything you need, and walks you through.  My wife did it for me, and we didn't even need a lawyer.",1280232339

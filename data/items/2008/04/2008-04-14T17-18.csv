I've seen people culture urgency and watched them value doing <i>something</i> over doing something <i>right</i>. The apparent urgency of a task trumps the mental and physical well-being of the people appointed to it. It's downright unhealthy.<p>What it really is though is unpolitic.

163296,comment,162987,163194,0,0,gruseom,,,"I couldn't agree more. I think it's an asinine practice that, if it is in fact being discredited, deserves it. I posted this as an example of the brainteaser interview being discussed elsewhere (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=162672"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=162672</a>), and am a little disappointed that most of the comments here are actually about manholes.<p>Brainteaser interviews are an artifact of the fundamental problem: there's no easy way to identify good programmers, so people come up with these ersatz, dysfunctional substitutes instead. The brainteaser is a seductive one because it's easy to think ""programmers are smart so let's test for smartness instead"". This confuses a necessary condition with a sufficient one. It also begs the question, since smartness isn't easy to test for either. The concept of ""smartness"" underlying the brainteaser interview is a shallow one of the party-trick variety. I see no reason to believe that it's correlated with the kind of programmer I'd want to work with on a project. Brain-teasing opaqueness is not a good thing in production code, and real programming problems are not much like riddles.<p>I also agree with your other point. Interviewers probing a programmer for ""smartness"", like a horse might have its teeth examined, or better, like a cow might have its udders palpitated - just feels unseemly to me. It's part of a corporate culture that is the modern version of the feudal system. It's the way you'd treat a peasant. The genius of the Larry-and-Sergey ad is that it speaks truthfully about this issue of respect, which is a very deep one, and of course is ultimately all about self-respect. (Look at some of the reactions to PG's lion metaphor to see just how true that is.)<p>So large organizations have no reliable process for hiring good programmers. As Paul Graham's writings have articulated so clearly, the fact that they have that problem doesn't mean that you do; they need you more than you need them. There's actually a much better test for which programmers add value in the long run: the market itself. Pass that test and you won't have to ask anyone to approve of your ""smartness"".",1208194492

What I've observed is, this almost never works.<p>In fact, taking a consulting approach to product development (working closely with a first customer) also slowed us down drastically, and our product actually has very little to do with our service (what we're launching has nothing to do with reverse engineering software).<p>There are also some high-profile failures behind our strategy: building a straight-up consultancy to ""fund"" a full time product group.<p>But then again, who knows?

Nothing did as much to destroy the joy I derived from math as did my college Calculus courses.<p>The current pedagogy of Calculus is atrocious, and any method which helps impart the beauty of it without battering the souls of the students is worth pursuing. Feynman's great strength was his disregard for orthodoxy in the search for greater truth. Big-O notation is for more than just profiling the costs of computational algorithms. It is for reasoning about inexact quantities and seeing the greater patterns in the relationships between numbers and functions. Is using Big-O as a method of teaching Calculus better than the current process? Honestly, almost anything would be an improvement.<p>Math and Calculus are both beautiful and practical.

Two problems: (a) it takes more than just discipline to walk away from money --- it takes reckless speculation, and that's painful; (b) consulting hours don't bucket neatly, and don't schedule neatly, and so you're constantly being disrupted.<p>(2) That said, we now have multiple full-time people working on product, which we're launching soon. The classic consulting model is a pyramid scheme, where people claw their way to ""partner"" and get fat off profit sharing. In the product-consulting model, instead of setting aside money for partners, you pay full-time devs. This appears to work.<p>If I had to choose between VC and consulting, and my consulting practice was lucrative (ours is: software security billable hours are expensive), I'd do consulting again, even though it cost us a year. Reasons:<p>* I'll trade a year for control over my own destiny.<p>* The year is a false economy, since, for <i>most companies</i>, getting funding takes many speculative months.<p>* There are things about running a consultancy as a business that translate to running a product business, and running a business is a valuable skill.<p>* The networking and customer face time you get from consulting is hugely valuable.<p>* Time to market is simply overrated.",1208192782

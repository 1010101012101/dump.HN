Manipulating Nigerian officials to incarcerate activists is much cheaper and achieves the same goals.<p>But let&#x27;s not assume that the Dutch government is therefore off the hook. I would not be surprised if Dutch diplomats extract trade information (through pacts, treaties and simple espionage) that gets passed on to Shell.<p>We might be low on the James Bond style intelligence signals, but as a country that&#x27;s an order of magnitude richer than we should be by any sane measure you can bet we&#x27;ve got our trademark smiling men in suits wherever the money flows.",1435629583

On top of that, the UPower reactor has a thermal transport time constant nearly 10 times that of other reactors, and its fuel is immune to the shocks that bother LWRs.  In fact, the same type of fuel was used in a research reactor and would be ramped in power from 5 watts to 150 billion watts in less than 50 millionths of a second.  That puts a lot of stress on fuel, yet this fuel kept its stride without breaking a sweat.<p>This reactor is built like a tank, and is designed to be quite resilient and flexible.  It can definitely load follow to support a renewable heavy grid system.  In fact it&#x27;s been considered for use as a grid stabilizer at substations because of these abilities.",1435629338

9802402,comment,9798374,9798374,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sigh. Sure, it&#x27;s possible, but very unlikely.<p>These &quot;MOND&quot; gravity theories purport to explain observations better than the theory of dark matter, but they don&#x27;t. They explain some things and leave gaping holes elsewhere. On the whole they are hugely inferior theories in terms of matching observational evidence. Their only advantage is that they lack the existence of massive, weakly interacting particles, which a lot of people seem to have strong objections to despite the fact that several types of such particles are already known to exist.<p>Throughout the entire history of the development of the theory of dark matter the bias has always been against the idea of true dark matter, unseen particles that make up most of the mass of the Universe. But at every single step all of the other possibilities have been eliminated as realistic explanations of the evidence. The cold WIMP dark matter theory is the only one that explains the structure of the cosmic microwave background radiation, the large scale structure of the Universe, and the structure and behavior of galaxies and galaxy clusters. At this point the theory of dark matter is remarkably well hemmed in, it would be absolutely shocking to an extreme degree if it did not truly exist in the form we think it does.<p>There&#x27;s additionally a very elegant mechanism behind the formation of dark matter. It seems most likely to be composed of super-symmetric particles. Such particles would only be able to form in extreme, high-energy conditions. Precisely the sort of conditions that existed in the early era of the Universe immediately after the Big Bang. So the early Universe would have been creating huge quantities of such particles, which would then not interact much due to their weak interactivity. It wouldn&#x27;t be until the Universe had expanded enough and cooled down enough to halt their production. This would neatly explain why so much of the mass of the Universe is in the form of dark matter rather than conventional matter.",1435629328

9802399,comment,9800549,9800549,0,0,abalone,,,"<i>> terrestrial-based atomic energy... has major advantages when it comes to cost</i><p>Are we talking public cost? Because that&#x27;s all that matters. So far the public cost of nuclear power has been extraordinary, due to accidents and waste.<p>I understand that some of these startups aim to process existing waste in relatively small distributed reactors but what is the public cost of spreading a bunch of &quot;mini&quot; toxic waste sites around the world that remain hazardous for 100 years, instead of centrally storing it?<p>Plus I&#x27;ve read that although these mini reactors are not directly producing material that could be used in a dirty bomb, that they could be converted to do so if they fell into the wrong hands. I may be oversimplifying here, but the question again is what is the public risk of distributing atomic fuels and reactors in a manner that makes them much less secure? Would this make them more susceptible to &quot;war hacking&quot; and could this be the mini-reactor equivalent of a nuclear disaster?<p>Nuclear costs have always been about the long term public costs, not the short term $/kWh.<p>This is before we even consider the taxpayer cost that&#x27;s gone into nuclear tech development. I wonder if there will be more public money needed to take this tech to market, even if the test reactors bear fruit.",1435629212

It is often overlooked in the &quot;well, the compiler should just throw an error instead of invoking undefined behavior&quot; debate: the compiler doesn&#x27;t just &quot;choose to invoke&quot; undefined behavior: it relies on it to do program analysis.<p>For example, your example could legally be rewritten to:<p><pre><code>    int x;
    f();
    x = 1;
    if (g()) { h(x); }
</code></pre>
The only difference is if f() were false, and someone would then access x and see 1; but that&#x27;s undefined behavior, so you can ignore it. In fact, assuming x is not accessible outside this block:<p><pre><code>    f();
    if (g()) { h(1); }
</code></pre>
These optimizations happen all over the place, it&#x27;s not the compiler invoking or causing undefined behavior, but assuming that it won&#x27;t ever happen.<p>EDIT: Note the further optimization that looms: if f() can be proven pure (no side effects), then it can be removed. This makes little sense for a function with no arguments (in which case it would just be a constant). If, however, f(y, ...) is some expensive but pure function, it can just be removed completely.",1435628892

9802347,comment,9802132,9802132,0,0,basseq,,,"This sounds like a (bad) case interview question. Which are, of course, more about the approach and rigor of thinking than a &quot;correct&quot; numerical answer.<p>Quickly, my approach would be something like:<p>1. Let&#x27;s agree on a definition of &quot;door&quot;. For the sake of estimation, let&#x27;s assume these are human-sized hinged openings. E.g., cabinet doors, garage doors, doggie doors, and other definitions don&#x27;t count. Since this is a total swag, let&#x27;s ignore things like double-hung doors. This still leaves open the idea of things like transportation (bus doors, car doors, train doors, elevator doors, etc.) that we could estimate by a similar method, but let&#x27;s ignore that, too.<p>2. To get to a total number of doors, let&#x27;s estimate the average number of unique doors an individual could interact with. We could probably draw a graph that resembles a reverse exponential curve: e.g., there are a large number of people who interact with zero or one doors per day (e.g., people in rural areas of developing countries) and a very small number of people who interact with a lot of doors.<p>3. To get to an average number of doors, we can thinking about residences and work locations. We can probably ignore other door locations, as a retail location you would go, for example, is someone else&#x27;s work location. So thinking about my own experiences:<p>3A. I have 22 doors at home, which I share with my wife. So 11 attributable to me. (<i>Aside:</i> count the number of doors in your house, apartment, etc.: it&#x27;s higher than you probably think. Even a studio apartment might have 4+.)<p>3B. Work is harder because no doors are &quot;mine&quot; (no office). I could go through and think about what percentage of a door is &quot;mine&quot;, but I don&#x27;t think it would be more than 0.5. Let&#x27;s round up to 1. It might be more like 2-3 for some people at the end of the curve.<p>4. Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m at, effectively, the far right on the curve with 12 doors. (After all, if we compare to global wealth distributions, a salary of $50k puts you in the top 1% worldwide.) The interesting thing about exponential curves is that the median is going to be in the first quintile, but the mean is going to be around the 50% mark. So we can assume the global average is 6 doors / person. (<i>Note:</i> this is the step you would nitpick, because it&#x27;s a giant assumption. Not to mention that my 50% comment isn&#x27;t accurate: totally depends on the shape of the curve. :) )<p>5. With a global population of about 7 billion people, the total number of doors is 42 billion.<p>Now we can argue about my assumptions and definition of &quot;door&quot;.",1435628503

They are no different than the properties imputed to neutrinos or the aether: <a href=""http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1801"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tjradcliffe.com/?p=1801</a><p>The important thing about extra-galactic dark matter is there is too much of it to be made of ordinary particles: protons and neutrons and electrons. We know how many ordinary nucleons there are because we have a pretty reasonable estimate of the primoridal ratio of hydrogen to helium. As the Big Bang cooled quarks eventually cooled down enough to make protons and neutrons. Free neutrons only live about fifteen minutes so they only had a short time to capture onto protons and make deuterium nuclei which could further colide to make helium. The ratio of He/H in the early universe is therefore a sensitive measure of the denisty of the universe at the time of nucleon condensation, and we know the radius from the temperature, so we can calculate the total number of particles. There aren&#x27;t enough to make up extra-galactic dark matter. There are enough to make up galactic dark matter, so there may be two totally unrelated dark matter problems.<p>When physicists talk about &quot;dark matter&quot; we are sliding back and forth between meanings according to context, but this is all lost on outsiders, unfortunately. It&#x27;s needlessly confusing, but unfortunately it&#x27;s the way it is.<p>So amongst the perfectly ordinary, non-magical properties that extra-galactic dark matter has to have is to be something other then ordinary neutrons and protons. There are some other contraints on its various interaction strengths that come from the scale of galaxy formation and larger scale structures in the universe too. Again, these are perfectly ordinary properties, inferred based on the evidence in exactly the same way the properties of aether and neutrinos were.<p>Dark matter may or may not exist (neutrinos do, aether does not) but there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about it. It is just normal science doing what science normally does.",1435627427

Is a chessboard a game now?<p>The stuff about the wii I was talking about wasn't the games but the software that manages the new controller.  The new UI for the wii is what I meant.  I'm not complaining there aren't open source games.  I'm just saying I don't think open source regularly produces something like the wii interface or the iphone that's both really revolutionary and good enough for people to use all the time without effort.  That's pretty well supported by evidence.  Sometimes, open source produces good solutions I like to use.<p>Now, I think there are lots of projects that don't need to be easy enough for everyone to use or revolutionary.  Open source is great for those situations and lots of others.  Remember I don't hate open source stuff.  I don't even know what it would mean for open source to fail or succeed.<p>Everyone wins when everyone helps each other out, but everyone also wins when a company pursues a singular vision an open source development style would cramp, and puts out something great closed source.  It's not a zero sum game here either.  [sarcasm]I don't think I'm trolling, I think you bitter open source cultists are projecting your misery at the better looking closed source people who get laid more then you onto my obviously true comment that probably everything in the world won't be open source in a year or two (just like Gilligan probably won't get off that island this time) and anyone who likes really awesome new stuff thats easy to use should thank God for that.[/sarcasm]<p>Sorry for that miscommunication.",1209325531

Might as well use Cecil Rhodes as a disproof of Africa's lack of enterprise.<p>Nonetheless, I agree with the article, and every time the question of Africa's woes come up, I'm the first to point out that Bill Gates and Bono (and the 1000s like them) are destructive, and that the proper approach to the problem is investment rather than charity.

My gut feeling is college and highschool students are responsible for most music downloads and they don't typically have the money to buy all the music they want. But these people typically grow up and get jobs and start purchasing music on iTunes (or Amazon) because their time becomes more valuable.",1209325042
174984,comment,174342,174557,0,0,jfoutz,,,"That's a pretty limited view of the capacity of computers. I'd bet a good 60% of your editing commands are cursor motion. So one pretty obvious improvement is to just <i>look</i> at foo, then do your edit. heck, it's still called cut and paste, how about pushing words around on the screen? not with the mouse, but with your hand on the screen.<p>The perfect ui is literally, read my mind and do what I want. I doubt we'll see fmri-at-a-distance in my lifetime, but I can indicate my wishes many many ways.<p>Also, there's some evidence that moving your hands to the mouse is faster, you just notice it, because it's effortless, whereas working out the key combination to move the cursor chews up clock cycles. (<a href=""http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html</a>)
And even if you are faster with the keyboard, it probably took you years to get as fast as you are. If programmers can provide a ui to get users to some sizeable fraction of your editing speed in days instead of years... it's worth it. The only real risk is if the fastest of the new ui category can't edit as quickly as the fastest of the traditional. Really, there's no way your hands can compete with looking at what you want.",1209324654
174983,comment,174967,174967,0,0,apgwoz,,,"Why is this a big deal? Essentially, a Javascript library is only ""linked"" with the HTML, which is being sent back to the client. By sending the HTML back to the client you're effectively providing the source. The GPL doesn't say anything about accessing resources over a network, so the server side of the application is fine. On the client side, you can still copyright the design of the site and it's content, so you're not loosing anything. Am I missing something?",1209324458

Much of Africa <i>desperately</i> needs a sustainable economy and parts of Africa are rather developed (parts of South Africa and Botswana, notably).  This whole shakedown with Mugabe in Zimbabwe is that Zim was well on its way to becoming a developed nation when his government destroyed the economy.<p>To put things in perspective, India is horribly poor, but by latching on to high-technology, it's finally creating a mechanism for social mobility.  There's a light at the end of the tunnel for India.  If something like that could happen in parts of Africa, it really could start a disruptive economic chain of events that might help pull some of the nations up by the bootstraps within a couple decades.<p>Feeding the hungry is noble, but it doesn't solve long term problems.",1209323607

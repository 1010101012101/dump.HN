10289768,comment,10289174,10289585,0,0,yokohummer7,,,"Like I said somewhere, a safe subset of C++ sounds wonderful at first, but it also has demerits:<p>- If you enforce memory safety to all of your code, the number of the libraries that you can use will be severely limited. Imagine if you can only use C++14 libraries. How many C++14 libraries are out there? And I&#x27;m not sure if there will be many libraries written in safe C++, at least for the next few years. The adoption rate for newer C++ standards (C++11, C++14) was generally not satisfactory.<p>- If you only enforce memory safety to your own code, then you could use the existing ecosystem. But in that case, your program will still segfault because of the libraries you&#x27;re using. Admittedly this is also a concern of Rust when you use C libraries in Rust. The more safe code you use, the safer your program is. The problem is, if you choose this route, there&#x27;s not much ecosystem-ish advantage in the C++&#x27;s side. You will also have to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; as you would have to do in Rust.<p>This problem all boils to this: adding guaranteed memory safety to the unsafe language is a breaking change. And the problems occurred by breaking changes are very hard to solve.",1443437866

You just need to avoid those performance optimizations that were en vogue in the 90s/early00s. Luckily modern computers (and the more modern C++ standards) can handle value semantics just fine and you don&#x27;t need to put pointers into vectors anymore because directly putting the data there would be too costly, etc.<p>If you only use the new (C++11 up) smart pointers (avoiding new/delete) you&#x27;ve essentially achieved 80% of Rust&#x27;s safety model. Add rigorous application of const correctness and you&#x27;re good to go. Rust still adds a few important things but until its eco system is matured (and there is real tooling) modern C++ is a pretty good alternative.",1443437482

(This would be <i>fantastic</i>. Think of the resources that&#x27;d be spent on such research! It&#x27;d be world-changing.) But even then, the inherent differences in a statement oriented vs expression oriented is likely to keep C++ being needlessly verbose.<p>And I object to using Rust (or other production-level but &quot;edge&quot; languages) as being &quot;job security&quot;. If the underlying software matters enough that using Rust has significant benefits, then it matters enough that employees spend a few days learning a bit of Rust. This fear of languages as if learning a language was this huge mountain to scale in hiring is just silly. The actual code and environment probably outweighs the language used significantly.<p>The real exception to this is if you&#x27;re running a codebase that has essentially non-programmers adding bits here and there.

I&#x27;m also from Python, which I&#x27;ve used for more than 10 years, and chose Rust as my next weapon.<p>- Haskell: While pervasive laziness does have its merits, I believe it is not the best choice in general, especially for performance-wise. Having to use streaming libraries to do even a simple I/O is just ridiculous. Its syntax was also a big obstacle to me, but thankfully I overcame it. But I&#x27;m not sure I can also persuade my colleagues to do the same thing.<p>- Scala: If I have a JVM requirement, Scala would be a really good fit. (Un)fortunately I don&#x27;t have such a limit, so what Scala provides are less appealing to me. It also seemed way too gigantic to me at a glance, probably to be interoperable with Java. But I&#x27;ve not tried it deeply.<p>- F#: I&#x27;ve only heard good things about that, and it was quite a great experience learning through its great IDE. The problem is that even though MS&#x27;s recent moves I&#x27;m still not completely sure if I could retrofit myself to the .NET ecosystem. But the future is bright.<p>- OCaml: OCaml always felt a bit &quot;obsolete&quot; to me. AFAIK it even didn&#x27;t have multi-core support until very recently (no parallelism, concurrency only), and they seem to have no resources for a decent Windows support. It has also a funny syntax. I definitely agree Rust&#x27;s syntax is ugly at best, but OCaml&#x27;s is... I just can&#x27;t describe it. Hopefully I can get used to it someday, like I did to Haskell.<p>And I met Rust and instantly fell in love, even though it requires me to do manual memory management. While manual memory management makes a certain data structure harder to implement, what I realized is that for my daily job, especially for &quot;boring&quot; works (e.g. CRUD apps), it is OK to use manual memory management. If there&#x27;s a need, I can always borrow libraries from others to accomplish my job. And it is fast by default, less need to optimize the code by myself, as seen in Haskell.<p>That said, what I have as a &quot;best&quot; language in my mind is, probably a strict version of Haskell. Yeah, that would be Idris, like the author suggests. I really hope that Idris will take off in the near future.",1443436390

I think we can make sensible guesses at the first three, and the last two and Drake&#x27;s Equation allows us a large margin of error. The likelihood of life developing and the likelihood of intelligence developing however… we don&#x27;t have much. A weird thing about both these things is that we are the only example we know of. Even earth, which has demonstrated an ability to develop both, seems to have done both only once. All life on earth shares an ancestry. Intelligence is debatable, but by a definition that carries the potential to build technology proving its intelligence to extra terrestrials we are the only example.<p>We can be reasonably certain that if we start from Eukaryotic life, eyes will evolve. Technology building and intergenerational knowledge accumulation is less certain. Even if you start with humans, it&#x27;s not obvious that technology will evolve. Homo existed for quite a while, even with individuals very similar to us before getting on this technology curve. Thousands of generations (or tends of thousands, depending on your definitions) of being smart, social bipedal apes anatomically similar to us with no apparent evidence that the invention of pornography-capable smartphones are forthcoming.<p>We have similarly little evidence about life&#x27;s chances of emerging. Some sort of replication process that has  evolutionary potential would be a decent definition in this context. How likely is that? Do we actually need the &quot;ingredients&quot; common to Europa and Earth? Is Earth&#x27;s &quot;ingredient list&quot; even ideal? Is organic chemistry the only way to do things? I think our ongoing invention of complex machines is, perhaps, a counterexample.<p>Back to the Drake equation, I think any time we can fill in one of the variables, tighten up our margins of error or otherwise add knowledge to this knowledge map, we are making interesting progress.<p>TLDR: At this point in time the existence of both life and intelligence must be assumed to involve ancient, god-like extraterrestrials.",1443436313

The one most people see, |> which &quot;pipes&quot; an argument, is defined in an F# library, not in the compiler or part of the core language. You can define it yourself to be anything you like, or not use it at all. The language is unaware of it and treats it like anything else. The definition is just:<p><pre><code>  let (|>) x f = f x\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s literally function application, in reverse. That&#x27;s all. It comes in handy for type inference and to make things look nice, but isn&#x27;t special in any way. I mention this as one comment as to why Rust doesn&#x27;t have such an operator was that &quot;Rust uses channels for data flow&quot; which is a non-sequiter. Rust just doesn&#x27;t value conciseness as much, and I&#x27;m guessing the safety/perf restrictions might complicate matters.<p>In fact, even the + and - operators are implemented in F# and shouldn&#x27;t count as part of the language (just very commonly used bits of the stdlib). I fear that perhaps not enough intros to F# focus on the relatively simple underlying language, and that everything else on top is just an application of said language.<p>With the type system, it&#x27;s actually easy to figure out the operators, based on the type alone. Looking at |> for instance, we see a type of:<p><pre><code>  &#x27;a -> (&#x27;a -> &#x27;b) -> &#x27;b \n</code></pre>\nThis makes it entirely obvious. There&#x27;s only one implementation for such a type definition. This holds true for so much of the stdlib that the &quot;noise&quot; quickly fades away. This is relevant as magic cannot hide, and misuse will quickly be identified by the compiler.<p>But it&#x27;s a valuable comment as it illustrates that the simplicity is not being marketed correctly and turning away potential users.",1443436217

This is important since Python encourages you to build native libraries for performance or low-level interfaces. The Rust programming style is also more familiar than &quot;true&quot; functional languages.<p>Languages like Go are tricky for Python extensions because they include their own runtimes, which means you have 2 runtimes with garbage collectors to deal with.<p>In a more &quot;fuzzy&quot; sense, I think there&#x27;s also a philosophical appeal in the way Rust promotes human-friendliness over theoretical purity.

10289676,comment,10289234,10289234,0,0,kcorbitt,,,"> This comes about because the distribution of friends on social networks follows a power law. So while most people will have a small number of friends, a few individuals have huge numbers of friends. And these people skew the average.<p>> Here’s an analogy. If you measure the height of all your male friends. you’ll find that the average is about 170 centimeters. If you are male, on average, your friends will be about the same height as you are. Indeed, the mathematical notion of “average” is a good way to capture the nature of this data.<p>> But imagine that one of your friends was much taller than you—say, one kilometer or 10 kilometers tall. This person would dramatically skew the average, which would make your friends taller than you, on average. In this case, the “average” is a poor way to capture this data set.<p>Based on the wikipedia article of the friendship paradox[1], the power law distribution really has nothing to do with it, and the paradox would exist even if the distribution of number of friends were completely uniform. It&#x27;s instead related to the fact that people with a high number of friends are overrepresented in the lists of other peoples&#x27; friends.

10289647,comment,10289174,10289548,0,0,bjz_,,,"> It is confusing to me, too, why a Ruby or Python user would look at Rust (for the same use cases).<p>Perhaps it is because they are not looking at it for the same use cases, and more as something to augment their toolkit. Rust makes it possible to be a decent systems programmer without having to spend a decade of acquiring the war wounds to become a great C or C++ dev. In the past, the only real option for those devs if they wanted decent performance was Java, and it&#x27;s really hard to get Java to talk to Ruby or Python, and it&#x27;s also hard to understand what the JVM is doing under the hood. Rust is now a possible alternative.",1443435001

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.&quot;<p>The point being that unless you understand something you&#x27;re very much better off <i>not</i> changing with it, because you can&#x27;t possibly understand the consequences of that action.<p>Mars might be devoid of life, and contaminating it might have no negative impact, but unless you <i>know</i> that&#x27;s the situation it&#x27;s better not to introduce potentially negative changes.",1443434930

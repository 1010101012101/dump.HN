It's a new direction that programming languages should explore more. Instead of CS theory emphasize psychological theory, since it's still humans that program.<p>And note the human reaction to yet another language like Dart. Many of the programming languages they've tried promised the moon, but turned out didn't have huge effects on general productivity. Libs, frameworks, idioms, testing approaches etc, have a bigger impact.",1322265587

Spotify (and for those who live in the US, Netflix and Hulu) is a great start, and last time I checked, they were dominating over piracy.<p>The new technologies are competing with piracy. Make a better service, with better conditions than the pirates can offer, and you win the battle.<p>In the end, the media companies need to choose between using the new technology that's being offered or disappear from the market. By the looks of it, some have gone with the latter option, and that is why we see these anti-piracy crackdowns.",1322265472

3278578,comment,3278089,3278089,1,0,loupgaroublond,,,"Probably the most important thing to know coming from the Windows world is that in Unix (which includes Linux) is that the OS is the IDE. From the way the OS is set up, where and how libraries are stored on disk, how you install things, to using various editors, tools, the command line and compilers, it is an IDE.<p>When you work with a 'stack' or a runtime like Mono, Python, a JVM, many of these details are partially hidden from view. The same if you use an IDE like Eclipse or MonoDevelop.<p>The better you understand this, the more shallow the learning curve will be with any tool you use, even emacs or vi.<p>As for getting started, here's a few pointers. It doesn't matter which distro you use, it's 2011, they all work pretty well. Instead pick the one you're most comfortable with. Mint and Ubuntu are good contenders because they are both easy to use, and Mint is based on Ubuntu. Fedora is better if you absolutely must use cutting edge tech. Suse is great for giving you a shiny frontend, close to cutting edge tools and an integrated environment that's also developer friendly. Just pick one, if you like it, stick with it for six months.<p>The same goes for runtimes and frameworks. Pick one you like, because a friend recommended it. Try the tutorials. If you like it, and get along with the community behind it, play around with it for 3-6 months before moving on.<p>Most importantly, find a friend who's using Linux already. Don't pester that person too much with questions, but just chat at least once a week about it. Focus on what you did, what you like, what was difficult. Chances are, your friend will be able to tell you, 'oh, sure, you could just do Foo and get this result'. Part of the learning experience is a week of pain you don't forget, solving it on your own, and then learning that other people solved the same problem.",1322264313

If they help, you comment as stated.<p>Secondly, HN is one of the most popular sources of tech news. By responding to this issue, Google is helping bring out possible solutions to a common problem - that crawlers are too frequent and affect the performance of a site. People like you and me can read the responses and learn what can be done to control this.<p>Third, popular websites like HN deserve attention like this because of the following they have garnered over the years. If,say ""hahla blog"" doesn't show as a top result in Google - it will take time for Google to verify whether it should even be shown as a top site.

Heliocentricity is one of those things where there is an absolute right and an absolute wrong. I think hate crime laws are not in the same class, they are strategies for achieving an end, and we have extremely imperfect information about the utility of these strategies.<p>For example, there is no way to do a true study. We can’t conjure up two countries that are identical in every respect except for there being a hate crime law in one and no such law in the other. Canada and the US are similar, but we Canadians have hate crime laws and gun control and socialized medicine and cheaper education and a bunch of other stuff.<p>What if Canada is a nicer place to live for visible minorities but it’s all the other stuff and not the hate crime laws? How could I know for sure? OTOH, what if the things you like about the US have everything to do with it being a wealthy country based on its resources and the size of its internal market and not to do with its freedom of speech?<p>So...

A lot of people are uncomfortable with sales transaction beyond those which require you to walk to a register and present goods for purchase.  A lot of people have a baked-in attitude that money is evil and trying to make it is a dirty business.  All these things have to be overcome to be successful as an entrepreneur.<p>Practicing selling on ebay requires you to write copy where you ask for the sale.  Closing a $150,000 sale requires you to ask for the sale.  Both sales require you to communicate with your buyer, to know your subject, to write clearly and to know when you are wasting your time.<p>Every sale is not identical, even on ebay, because each time a new customer appears with different needs and a different level of understanding.<p>I once bought a bulk lot of electronic equipment at live auction, then sold all the individual pieces on ebay, making a tidy little profit.  This predated my efforts to sell anything online, and I learnt an enormous amount.  I learnt that some people will pay silly prices for things, maybe because they need it right now, maybe because they live remotely and can't drive to the shop, maybe because they don't know the value of things.<p>I learnt how to write copy that got the point across, communicated my trustworthiness as a seller, and yet communicated the important details without reading like a spec sheet.<p>I even managed to sell a clearly broken LCD as a bet with one of my friends, who bet me I could sell it, and I bet nobody would buy it.  Someone paid me $40 for an LCD with a massive crack and bleeding in it. I have no idea why - perhaps they wanted the case or some other part of it.<p>I lost that bet and learnt a good lesson in the meantime, which is don't presume to know who or what your market is.

Because the format has been specified from the beginning it's easy to build all sorts of tools on top of it and add as much knowledge as you want, including line-by-line diffs, rename tracking, etc. It also ignores some hard problems people were focusing on at the time (merges, for example).<p>Socially, it first had a big userbase because the kernel is a large enough project and the switch was made top-down as far as I remember (not everybody was forced to do it but it was much easier if you could). This means a lot of people had to get acquainted with it, and this set of people turned out to be somewhat competent at changing it to make it faster, more stable, and easier to use (up to a point).

If there are no other candidates... sorry but that's not the employee's problem.<p>Personally I'd be more concerned with people who start, work a few months and then up and leave because something better came along. By that point they really have cost you time and money. You've invested in them.<p>But before they even start? The investment (and thus the commitment) is minimal.<p>If you've applied for a visa on their behalf, you may be out of pocket (which I'd have a problem with). Relocation expenses? You can pursue recovery of those. If you used a recruiter, a candidate who reneges won't cost you (typically the recruiter must given partial refunds on commissions should the employee leave in the first three months).<p>As for not accepting in the offer in the first place, this is fine in theory and certainly fine for someone who has experience and is in demand. A new graduate is at a severe disadvantage and may think it's either accept this or get nothing.<p>If someone reneges on working for you it's typically a minor inconvenience.<p>If an employer reneges on an employment contract it can often be devastating (personally, professionally and financially) for the candidate, particularly if the typical recruiting season is over and they've declined other offers.<p>This is not a meeting of equals.

3278492,comment,3277453,3278427,5,0,rdtsc,,,"> You're mixing things up.<p>I actually agree with him.  The point of ""at will"" employment is that usually firing happens if the employee has done something terribly wrong. Usually they are ""let go"" for ""no reason."" It avoids a potential legal mess.  Well a reason is given but it is a safe reason ""we are restructuring"" and such. The real reason could be anything, heck it could be race or gender, as long as nobody puts that in writing it doesn't matter.  It would take a long established pattern of lay-offs to prove that a certain group is targeted. But that's besides the point. The point is that the law is presented a ""wonderful feature"" to new college graduates -- ""amazing, you have the freedom to leave anytime"". I would guess that most often than not, it is used by companies to get rid of employees. BUT in this one instance, that law can (and should) be applied by the employee.<p>I really don't like how all of the sudden ""morality"" starts playing into in. Morality in such instances (mortgage payments and employment) is what is used by the more powerful entity to (company or bank) to keep in check those that are in a less powerful position (""it is immoral to stop paying your mortgage"", ""it is immoral to quit after 3 days"").<p>The point is that morality doesn't and shouldn't play into it. Usually companies don't follow moral principle but rather legal principle. Smart individual should do the same thing. Otherwise they are and will be abused and taken advantage of.",1322262202

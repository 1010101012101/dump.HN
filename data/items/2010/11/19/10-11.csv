1921042,comment,1920677,1920917,0,0,meastham,,,"Like others have mentioned it's rather academic, but also pretty cool. It's a way of introducing recursive functions into the untyped lambda calculus. I think the easiest way to see it is using it in scheme to define an anonymous recursive function:<p><pre><code>  (((lambda (fact)\n      ((lambda (f)\n         (fact (lambda (n) ((f f) n))))\n       (lambda (f)\n         (fact (lambda (n) ((f f) n))))))\n    (lambda (fact)\n      (lambda (n)\n        (if (= n  0)\n          1\n          (* n (fact (- n 1)))))))\n   10)\n\n</code></pre>\nComputes 10!<p>You'll notice that lines 6-10 define a procedure that takes a factorial function, performs one level of the recursion, and then calls the factorial function to compute the rest. The Y combinator, implemented in lines 1-5, basically allows us to start the recursion. A step by step derivation can be found at <a href=""http://www.ece.uc.edu/~franco/C511/html/Scheme/ycomb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ece.uc.edu/~franco/C511/html/Scheme/ycomb.html</a><p>The really neat thing about this is that all that was required to create that factorial function was lambda, some arithmetic functions, and if. Arithmetic can be implemented using only lambdas (google church numerals) and so can if. Using these techniques you can create a factorial function using only lambda and function application (which is exactly the lambda calculus).<p>If you replace ""program"" in the Forbes article with ""function"" I don't think they're terribly far off.",1290163296

1921035,comment,1920609,1920998,0,0,iwr,,,"That may be the reason that large organizations are difficult to maintain. How many of the Fortune 500 companies today were still there 4 years ago?<p>As an organization grows, it requires people in support structures that are less linked to the ultimate bottom line. Ludwig von Mises proposed the idea that an organization requires a level of bureaucracy, in the absence of market signals. So to the extent that an employee is removed from from the direct market operations of the company, a bureaucracy is required.<p>Now, the reason companies don't outsource all their work to bidding contractors is that there is some value in holding resources in reserve. A bid-contractor is only as good as the next assignment, he may leave for another company when you need him the most. The solution is to have a contract where the particular individual will reserve his time and energy to one company (a.k.a. an employee). The employee will be effectively ""slacking off"", but will be on call for when his resources are needed.",1290162936

It has weakly dynamically typed columns (will happily store strings in INT column), and ROWID/auto increment is icky (magic behavior with special-casing for backwards compatibility).",1290161353

It's also one of the most atmospheric and convincing SF worlds ever realised on film, on a par with Blade Runner. It's got plenty of cool bits and a wicked Brian Eno soundtrack.<p>What you have to remember about Nausicaä is that it's 26 years old. Miyazaki was hitting wonderfully balanced deep green themes and using ambiguous villains whilst Disney was churning out 'Mickey's Christmas Carol'. There's lot's of truly wonderful space and silence in Nausicaä's 'forest' scenes.",1290161275

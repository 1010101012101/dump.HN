Any user behavior that requires new data could be an ajax call that passes back the entire state of the current &#x27;page&#x27;, which could then replace the state of top-level component (since you want most of your state to reside there anyways). React takes over from there. You&#x27;d be relying mostly on your server-side framework for the logic.<p>You could then incrementally add logic client-side to improve performance, if that&#x27;s necessary (if the state object becomes too large, for example).",1400000276

The four original value statements from the Agile Manifesto are mentioned far too infrequently compared to all the processes and tools peddled by various agile salespeople.<p>A friend of mine recently asked me to give a short presentation to a few developers working at his small software company. He suggested that Agile may be a good subject and we spent an hour discussing how his developers analyse, design, code and test their projects so that I could give a relevant talk.

7739185,comment,7737061,7738964,3,0,boredlawyer,,,"Nope. Politicians, celebrities aka „public figures“ do not have the same rights to privacy. (due widely judicially established consensus in human rights/constitutional „continetal european law“). Therefore private person has judicially enforceable right for protect his private life to higher extend than public figures.<p>More often many European countries would not prohibit public display of “personal data” such as name, home address etc. Not only concerning all crime victims and children, but often also court rulings while being public, are published in such way, that names and other personal data is removed. \nSo when you’d google a name of a person, public court ruling proclaiming foreclosure of his property would not appear in the search result, while some blog/news outlet could. The ruling only reacts to reality of modern day, that information doesn’t disappear. So while 50 years ago (or as today) the article about someone’s foreclosure would still be reachable in newspaper archives, library etc., but not via two seconds by googling. So if the right to privacy ought to be a real “human right” it needs to be effectively pursuable, so court seeks an approach when there is no reason to delete the newspaper article (it’s not fraudulent or slanderous”) but it’s digital trace via search engine interferes with one’s right to privacy.<p>I anticipate that EU, or individual countries will react by enacting/changing laws how to procedurally enforce that newly established right. How and when to file such request for removal of search result.",1400000247

7739180,comment,7735141,7737909,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> When you create a donation that impacts potentially an auth record and a user account (if they create one), a donation, as well a it could end up touching the event, participant, team, or organization itself. Now, do you make all those data changes as a series of nouns with actions that you must do in some particular workflow and order? Or, do you have a higher level verb that you throw input at and it returns a result, doing whatever it needs to do in the process? Or do you have a noun with a single verb that starts to feel a lot like RPC?<p>Well, you have a noun &quot;donation&quot;. Whether it has multiple or single verbs depends on what operations make sense against that noun. Though it seems like that it would support multiple verbs.<p>There is no guarantee in REST that an operation on one resource has no effect on other resources. In fact, its quite common for operations to effect other resources.<p>> I would expect in REST you might have to hit multiple nouns to change all the state appropriately and I&#x27;m not sure there is a good mechanism to enforce that it happens correctly according to the desired workflow.<p>The method is that in this case, the &quot;donation&quot; resources would support appropriate verbs, and the other nouns which could not be changed independently which might be changed as a result of actions on the donation resource would not need verbs to support those changes, but would change as a result of the course of implementing the actions on the donation resource.<p>People seem to think of REST in terms of mapping to RDBMSs with resources as analogous records in base tables in a normalized schema against which you conduct CRUD operations. But, if you have to think of REST in RDBMS terms, its a better analogy to think of the resources exposed by an API as records in a set of potentially updatable, potentially denormalized, and potentially overlapping <i>views</i> rather than <i>base tables</i>.",1400000239

They cannot tell at a glance whether the code and/or architecture is museum-quality or DailyWTF fodder.  They cannot tell when the entire development team is colluding to implement mortgage-driven development.  The fundamental flaw in the system is that managers and developers do not think in compatible ways.  To the manager, a developer might as well be an alien, asking him for more cows and sharper scalpels.  To a developer, the manager might as well be an alien, asking him to drop his pants and hop up onto the Probulator.<p>What is really needed is someone with both pointy hair <i>and</i> a neckbeard, who can translate easily between the people who need to cover their asses and justify their own existence, and the people who need both rational objectivity and aesthetic merit in their work.

No threat, all opportunity. But same net effect.<p>> Effective agile practice breaks down a barrier between people making decisions and people doing the work.  That must feel like a threat if your position involves little more than politely instructing other people what to do.<p>Honestly, I think that that the subset of management that understands agile well enough that they <i>could</i> feel threatened by it if they couldn&#x27;t find a way to profit from it is the same subset that understands how to let it happen and own the results.

It&#x27;s not WhereEver Police Department that has an issue with racial bias and violent escalation, it&#x27;s just a few bad apples. Our school district does not have a bullying problem, it&#x27;s just a few bad apples. Etc.<p>What is interesting about this cliched defense is that it is actually a malformed statement of the original cliche, &quot;A few bad apples spoil the barrel.&quot;<p>The original cliche refers to a phenomenon where overripe or rotten apples release ethylene gas, which is a ripening agent. This ethylene gas will accelerate the ripening/rot of nearby apples. If you are not vigilant in weeding out the bad apples, the rot will rapidly spread and soon there will be no good apples left to rescue.<p>Human &quot;bad apples&quot; don&#x27;t release ethylene gas, but they corrupt their peers nevertheless. When a good cop backs the cover story of his corrupt cop partner, he becomes a bad cop as well. When prosecutors take up arms in defense of their corrupt prosecutor peers, they become no better than the initially targeted. If school administrators allow a bully to have his way for too long, then everybody else sees that they can get away with it too and before long you have daily fistfights behind the school at the end of the day.<p>Institutions that have had widespread unchallenged corruption for decades rarely need keyhole surgery, they need amputations.&quot;",1399998790

The idea is actually very simple - not much thing to hide - but it is not easy to implement without at least basic knowledge in telecom and electronics. Here are the ideas- A video phone system attached to a TV + webcam that can be operated with only a remote control. As a side effect we have Netflix, Hulu-Plus, youtube etc. on it for free. I use arduino for remote control part using a infra-red sensor and it is connected to a beagle bone black. BBB controls the communication. I use SIP for signaling. It will to be sub 40$ I guess when custom built and manufactured as a single device. A media capable home phone - nothing new or special but hopefully easier to use than existing ones. Still need to answer why someone use it instead of Skype. I am mostly depending on its design rather than cutting edge technology.<p>All the parts work separately but need to make a solid device that does not fail. I have talked to my friends in here, Europe, Australia and Asia- it works (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/w3voice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/w3voice</a>  has some video call photo) - they don&#x27;t have the device yet- but my system works from browser with webrtc as well (no plugin required for firefox and chrome). The ssl certificate has expired (was using a 3 month trial) so can not share the site now. But prototype to product seems harder than I thought while doing weekends only. I even needed to buy a wooden box for this. This is frustrating because I am sure I will need to change things before people finds it interesting. So, need to build one as soon as possible. As it is now it may be actually a bad idea.<p>And yes, I live in Seattle area in Washington (west one). I did not think YC or anyone would be interested to find a solo guy working from living room with probably a bad idea in the first place (I have not applied to any yet- including YC). I was planning to complete it in a few months and go for them. I got few people interested to buy, so will have some customers as well.",1399997718
7738896,comment,7738293,7738293,12,0,bluesmoon,,,"Your math is somewhat incorrect.  First, average[1] page load time is only relevant if your data distribution is a perfect bell curve.  It never is.  It&#x27;s more likely to be Log-normal, in which case a Geometric mean is a better number, but again it it&#x27;s unlikely to be perfectly Log-normal.  It&#x27;s likely to be double-humped (though you may not notice it), but the median and the entire distribution are very necessary.  You&#x27;ll find that the median load time is typically lower than the arithmetic mean, but the 95th or 98th percentile is typically much higher.<p>Secondly, you cannot simply divide by 70% to get the load time for 70% of your users, because again, that assumes a very specific distribution (a linear distribution, which doesn&#x27;t exist for any site with more than 5 hits).  What you really need to measure is the &quot;empty-cache&quot; experience, which is different from the &quot;first-visit&quot; experience, and is harder to measure since it&#x27;s hard (but not impossible) to tell when the user&#x27;s cache is empty.<p>Lastly, you&#x27;re assuming a user drop-off rate without looking at your own data for user drop-off.<p>You should probably use a real RUM tool that shows you your entire distribution, but also shows you how users convert or bounce based on page load time.  Looking at actual data can be surprising and enlightening (I&#x27;ve been looking at this kind of data for almost a decade and it still surprises me and forces me to change my assumptions).<p>My company (SOASTA) builds a RUM tool (mPulse), which you can use for free.

(The classic example being the pressure to exhaust your budget by the end of the year, which has been joked about for ages but few organizations seem interested in fixing.)<p>Most of the explanation is probably the obvious answer: fixing the broken system requires calling higher-status people on the carpet.

One thing I realized is that centralization has killed the ability for anyone to think outside the box.

Most people aren&#x27;t aware that many union contracts prohibit the principal from choosing the teachers in the school because of seniority rules, and getting rid of bad teachers is essentially hopeless. And of course all teachers are paid the same, based on years of tenure, rather than actual outcomes or instructional needs.<p>I&#x27;ve seen schools which most would consider being in the worst part of the ghetto doing very well because of a highly motivated principal. The more we centralize, the harder it becomes to do anything of value to help schools perform better. And the trend continues to be more and more in the direction of centralization.",1399997611

For example, the German chancellor is only voted into office indirectly by parliament. She can then appoint any ministers she wants, no confirmation needed by anyone. No one would call Germany undemocratic.<p>The EU commission just works similarly, only that in its case elected governments are making the appointments, though they have to additionally be confirmed by the EU parliament.<p>I’m all for structuring it differently, but to call it undemocratic is just wrong.

I can use it but need someone to hold my hand. It reminded me of Enterprise Java Beans.<p>AngularJS has a serious &quot;naming&quot; problem.<p>Most these concept are easily understood when explained the right away,what AngularJS doc doesnt do. The only complicated thing to grasp is the digest cycle. But anything else is trivials.It&#x27;s nowhere near the complexity of Java EE.<p>Scopes are easy,like any composite structure you have nodes with children and parents ,what make scopes special is that they can inherit properties from their parent scopes.<p>Directives are just custom html elements/attributes where you should do dom manipulation,all other angularjs components should be free from any DOM manipulation,Directives are the closest thing to react components.<p>Controllers represent the state of the view,when the data in a controller changes, a view that exposes that data changes and vice et versa.<p>Services are dumb objects that can be shared between controllers and dependency injection is the way one share these services. Controllers can references services ,and services can reference other services. Services are singletons<p>So there is nothing really complicated with all these concepts,just that the doc sucks for some reason.",1399997077

The Lisp concept is pretty beautiful, and CL, for better or worse, has been more ubituitous than most other dialects of Lisp.<p>When I hear people (including myself) wax eloquent about the beauty of Lisp, even Common Lisp in particular, I don't take that to mean that every detail of the design is beautiful, but rather, the whole of Lisp / Common Lisp is a beautiful programming system. I can look out my office window here and see a beautiful tree, though I know upon closer inspection I could find some flaws and imperfections in the tree. Perhaps a branch has broken off, or maybe an animal has gnawed away at some bark.  That doesn't do away with its overarching beauty.",1277488756

Not sure what's the current status of Scribd, but disabling scripts brought out a lot of spam words years ago (maybe they don't use it anymore), so annoyance is pretty much the same (or isn't there, depending on your view)<p>- third - unicode: We're talking about pdf-s. They have their own tags, for example for the title which makes the name pretty much irrelevant. Unless you're downloading a book with ""Author - Title.pdf"" name, you're most likely going to run into ""some_serial_number"", ""ModelNumberDescription_code"" for manuals, ""thesis.pdf"" or some other internal convention. Actually zipping the file allows you to see the original one.<p>- fourth - limits: Megaupload has none that I know of and I get >200kB/s most of the times.<p>So it might be very subjective, but even considering all the crap download pages give us, I'd take a Megaupload-ed .pdf over Scribd any time.<p>+ After writing this, I got back to scribd and tried to download something - it's <i>MUCH</i> better than it was before.

If we want to split hairs over whether that distinction is meaningful, let&#x27;s look at a couple of example scenarios:<p>1. Someone convinces a blind woman that he/she is her partner and has consensual sex with her. Is this rape? Did she only consent to sex with her partner, making the sex non-consensual? Or did she consent to sex with the person in the room with her, making this consensual sex?<p>2. A woman consents to sex, thinking that she is talking about vaginal intercourse. Her partner penetrates her anally. Did she consent to &#x27;sex&#x27; in a general sense, so the specifics (anal vs. vagina) are not really important?",1404489526

7989258,comment,7986612,7988976,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"The chrome (nav, footer, etc.) that you mentioned is one part of the equation, but the other part is styling/layout of the content itself. That is, within a page that features chrome, there is still the need to layout other elements of the page.<p>So, CSS fails miserably at the latter. And, ironically, the former (i.e. chrome) can largely be handled very cleanly via other means (e.g. a templating system that modularizes the chrome and content elements).<p>In any event, what you&#x27;re saying is true to a large extent. It is not ideal to cart around data with presentation, so it is tempting to impose some degree of additional separation by <i>some</i> technology.<p>But, the challenge is that it doesn&#x27;t tend to match the real world. That is, the idea that there are or should be these agnostic HTML documents lying around filled with, effectively, unstructured data is more myth than anything. The unstructured data is in the database or elsewhere. What you&#x27;re generally doing is taking all of that raw content and presenting it. That&#x27;s how it ends up in HTML. And, the truth is that HTML is really a presentation language more than a document/data language. If you want the latter, then you&#x27;d move up a level to &quot;pure&quot; XML. But, the same problem exists: now you really do have raw content akin to DB data, so how do you now impose a visual layout on that data?<p>So, here, I would argue that the separation has largely occurred before you get to HTML, thus it is OK to use HTML&#x27;s more intuitive layout capabilities to layout the document.<p>Attempting to instead remove it from the HTML is simply adding an abstraction. And, honestly, we haven&#x27;t decoupled anything. We&#x27;ve just moved it to an interdependent, less intuitive document that must now be carted around too.<p>So, while CSS is onerous for layout, I think the motivation behind relocating layout responsibility must also be scrutinized. Even if a less onerous CSS replacement existed, the cost of separation must really be weighed against what is actually being gained.",1404489494
7989257,story,,,3,8,espringe,"Ask HN: What to do with my security product?",,"A few months ago, I wrote a security product based on the whole &quot;scratch an itch&quot; philosophy. I had a couple bitcoins stolen, and realized that most modern malware includes such a routine. So I thought it would be neat to write a service that can generate and monitor a (sentinel / honey pot) bitcoin wallet that can function as an intrusion detection system by sending email/sms alerts when ever it detects on the network the movement of money.<p>Fast forward to now: the product works great -- all my testing with malware, and potential customers testing has been really positive. However, I&#x27;m faced with one seemingly insurmountable problem -- I can&#x27;t seem to monetize the product. And I&#x27;m left with the conclusion that my product is too narrow to stand on its own. Consumers just aren&#x27;t interested, and companies seem to want a whole &quot;security suite&quot; or just one thing that is installed by a security consultant (Not to mention, a lengthy sales cycle -- which is hard on an engineer like me).<p>So I&#x27;m getting a bit frustrated with the process, and already have been largely dedicating myself to a new venture. However, before I give up entirely, I would like to take a shot at selling the product. I&#x27;m not looking for a million dollar exit or anything -- I&#x27;d be happy to sell and support/integrate it for enough to cover my living expenses while I pursuit other ventures.<p>I&#x27;ve tried cold-emailing/calling a few security companies, but they seem largely uninterested. And the two companies that had shown interest, ended up fizzling out after ~3 weeks of talks. Perhaps an acquisition at 50k is just not enough to be worth their time?<p>So HN, what should I do with my security product?",1404489475

If she never realised he didn&#x27;t wear a condom, then it&#x27;s not rape. It&#x27;s an evil and possibly criminal thing to do, but it&#x27;s not &quot;forcing someone to have sex against their will&quot;.<p>For the record, I think either action makes Julian Assange a total asshole, and quite possibly someone who should go to jail.

7989219,comment,7988738,7988738,24,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;m going to comment on the political aspect and leave the technical JVM-centric bit alone.<p><i>In this example, did we learn what is faster, Java or Scala? Nope. But we learned a lot digging for explanations why the results are different, which will hopefully result in having better cohesion between languages and the underlying platform.</i><p>Performance is often FUD when it comes to languages. Clojure, Scala, Haskell, and even Common Lisp are plenty fast enough for most purposes. Hell, Python and Ruby are fast enough for most applications. Besides, runtime performance has more to do with how the code is written than anything else. You can write very fast C++, if you spend a lot tweaking it and hire experience and extremely expensive ($300k/year and up) programmers, but typical C++ isn&#x27;t any faster than well-written code in other languages. (I&#x27;ve seen C++ projects fail for performance reasons related to maintainability issues that arguably wouldn&#x27;t exist if Haskell were used.) However, invoking <i>performance</i> is a great (if unreliable, given who it brings on to the field) way to scare decision-making business people (toddlers with guns) into taking your side on an issue they know nothing about.<p>This is a place where it&#x27;d be better if programmers were a little more politically savvy. (Bringing The Business into a technical dispute is not politically savvy. It ruins everything, in the long run. Never invite executives, also known as toddlers with guns, to anything. As many a Chinese noble learned about opening The Wall and letting the Mongols in to fight one&#x27;s battles, it&#x27;s impossible to get them out after it&#x27;s done.) Let&#x27;s say you have a team of 5 programmers who want to write something in Python, which is (for most purposes) fast enough. One of them stands up and says, &quot;oh no, we can&#x27;t do this in <i>Python</i> because <i>if we end up running this on 100,000 boxes</i> it will be too expensive, so we can only use C++&quot; (premature optimization). If he were more politically savvy, he&#x27;d build the thing in Python and <i>then</i>, if the software were to run on 100,000 boxes, rewrite performance-critical pieces in C++, and justify a bonus for himself by pointing to the 20,000 CPUs that were just deprovisioned. And a year later, a month before bonuses are disbursed, he can rewrite another performance-critical component. This is good for him (he actually gets recognized, instead of being that annoying guy who bludgeoned a team into writing C++ and taking 4x as long to deliver an MVP) and for the business (only performance-critical components, with price tags large enough for him to care, get rewritten).<p><i>Oh, and if you think that part is constructive and boring, and you came here for a language holy-war, I do think both Java and Scala suck as programming languages, because they both allow me to write stupid programs with performance problems.</i><p>I assume this is sarcasm, but I actually worry about the fact that Those of Us Who Care About Languages are too divided over minutiae like Haskell&#x27;s syntactic whitespace and Clojure&#x27;s parentheses, and that may be why The Business comes in, mushroom stamps us and says, &quot;I&#x27;m sick of your shit, programmers. Everything has to be in Java.&quot;<p>(Actually, if you&#x27;ve watched <i>Orange is the New Black</i>, you know that The Business has taken to calling software engineers &quot;inmate&quot;, but that&#x27;s another discussion.)<p>I like Haskell and I like Clojure for very different reasons, and they are very different languages, but the day-to-day real-world differences between them are small compared to the very real risk of The Business overhearing our flamewar and saying, &quot;fuck you guys, Java all the way, now lick my SCRUM or it&#x27;s minus-5 story points for you.&quot;<p>One of the things that worries me about Clojure is that, while I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s the best (for a definition of &quot;best&quot; that includes short-term business viability; this enables me to exclude obscure niche languages that may be better on paper, but that are just too numerous for me to know anything about) dynamically-typed language-- a great language on its own right, but sitting on top of the JVM and having access to those libraries-- there&#x27;s been a mind-share split between Clojure and Scala. And while Scala/Java and Clojure/Java interop aren&#x27;t bad, Clojure/Scala interop is a mess. On top of this, while Odersky&#x27;s brilliant, I think Scala has taken in a little too much of the Java culture for it&#x27;s own good. Scala&#x27;s a fine language to write in, but large Scala codebases are generally things that I&#x27;d rather not risk my sanity and career by being anywhere near them. If Scala wanted to be &quot;Haskell with Java libraries&quot; it would been a different and harder fight... but then again, it might not have taken off at all without the &quot;slightly better Java&quot; crowd, so maybe the way things happened was the only possibility.<p>The mind-share split between Clojure and Scala scares me, because it generates a very real risk that the intellectual energy that I&#x27;d like to see benefitting both languages, or at least consistently benefitting one of them, might fall back down the tree onto Java. The real risk, to me, is &quot;Clojure vs. Scala: Divided We Fall&quot;. But I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do about it.",1404488816

C++ also uses vtables and compilers often inline calls to methods if the method/type can be determined at compile time.<p>The argument as to why it can be faster than plain C is very weak, though. It says that if C programmers don&#x27;t use the restrict keyword, equivalent Swift code can be faster. This is right, but ignores the fact that careful and competent C programmers <i>will</i> put restrict in all the places where performance matters. It&#x27;s very hard to be faster than plain C, because it has a long, long history, and as a result, the compilers have been steadily improving for a long time. It is also less powerful allowing you to be closer to the actual assembly code that is to be generated.<p>But with increasingly better hardware, the speed gains of plain C are diminishing. Yes, you can be very fast, but is it worth the trouble of expressing yourself in such a low-level language?<p>Also, since you can&#x27;t type-pun (alias) in Swift, you can&#x27;t do some things that can be done using plain C, so it is unclear how it can be faster.",1404488550

Flexbox, for instance, prescribes a very particular pattern to the layouts that it affords. You must be rather methodical in how you break your layout into nested rows and columns. This focus on rows and columns causes quite a bit of visual shoehorning, or forces you to resort to hacks, at which point you&#x27;ve lost most of the benefit of using flexbox at all. Though for simple- to medium-complexity layouts where the visual arrangement is composed of nested rectangles following simple rules (as most of the web seems to be), flexbox is wonderful once you get the hang of it.<p>I&#x27;m very fond of constraint-based layout systems (and rule systems in general), having written a few of them myself. I feel that while this GSS project isn&#x27;t a complete realization of the promise they offer, it is a nice step in that direction. I worry about the performance and complexity burdens this project seems to impose, though I say that only looking at the docs, the generated code, and the discussions that emerged the last time this was posted to HN. I will be using it for an in-house dev-facing tool in the near future, and about that I am quite excited.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/91393694"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/91393694</a>",1404487495

I think working in this space for a few years at one point in my career (but no longer) lends more credibility to my argument, not less.<p>I never said there isn&#x27;t such a thing as manipulative advertising, what I said was that advertising is not inherently manipulative and dishonest. It&#x27;s a tool for communicating, and in my experience in general people see though manipulation tactics, such like they do when you try to sell them something by bullshitting them. Well written Google ads, well written marketing for websites, etc, all generally flow from a central theme of communicating clearly and honestly to the reader what value you are offering, and giving them reasons to want to pursue your business.

In a resource constrained environment, AOT compilation and reference counting get you to a fairly high level of performance and good levels of abstraction with enough simplification for the programmer&#x27;s task, but without taking too much away from UX in the form of lag.<p>Mobile is always going to be resource constrained for the same reason highways are always busy at rush hour. Such resources are too valuable to stay unused for long.<p>(Dalvik will never go to ref counting, but the design trade offs in its GC will reflect the same goals.)",1404486298

Desktop computers don&#x27;t need that much either&quot;<p>And 640k will be enough for everyone.<p>Hey, you might even be right about not needing them, but that doesn&#x27;t mean those devices won&#x27;t get them. You don&#x27;t really need a 32-bit CPU to run your microwave or washing machine, but very few of the ones you buy today are running 8-bit microcontrollers with hand-coded assembler.<p>Though clock speeds stopped increasing some time ago, Moore&#x27;s law marches on, and we&#x27;re still getting more and more transistors per buck. Sure, some of them will go to more L1/L2 cache, but at some point the bandwidth to flush them to main memory becomes a bottleneck, so I think we&#x27;re going to see more and more cores/chip. As that marches on, I think it&#x27;s going to trickle down to even the low end of CPUs. For instance, you might even be able to buy a bunch of 64-core chips which have a bunch of cores disabled really cheap, because the disabled cores failed factory testing and were switched off. It can&#x27;t be sold for full price any more, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s useless.<p>And once your $5 CPUs have 32 cores, well, providing the tooling is there, you might as well use a framework that makes use of them.<p>&quot;many of them just run a browser and Excel.&quot;<p>Bad choice of examples there, I think. Browsers can be pretty multi-process heavy these days, with one main process, plus one per tab, plus extra processes for e.g. decoding streaming video in the tab, or running your (<i>spit</i>) EME plugins (<i>spit</i>) in a sandbox.<p>Similarly, with Excel, sure most of the time it doesn&#x27;t do much. But, if you&#x27;ve got a spreadsheet with a bunch of dependent cells/formulas, then if someone updates the right cell, being massively parallel could really speed up value recalculations and propagation throughout the sheet. Some spreadsheets translate really well to map/reduce, and using all the cores could really help there.",1404486022

Full time.\nThis is myifth monthly post and have hired a couple of great guys from the past posts.<p>Expanding the scope to include Analytics, Data Warehouse, DevOps and App developers. Please read on.\nI have recently taken up a role to build a payment network from scratch, out of Bangalore, India. It is funded by a big corporation, but will be arms-distance from their central business.<p>It is a large, complex and fascinating problem to crack. The potential to bring banking to 600 million un/underbanked Indians is what excited me to work on this.<p>In the past I have built both fast-data and big-data companies and have a few patents in this space.<p>We are looking to hire a good core team of full time math, physics and CS majors, UI UX and product managers, who will work of Bangalore, India.<p>If you are interested, please email me at google&#x27;s email service - takenottie.

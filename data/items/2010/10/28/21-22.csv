In general, yes, you write the contract, and pay no more than half up front. But before you get into all these contract details, the area to work on is figuring out who is honest & competent; and who is not. Try to be sure about that before you worry about contracts. Contracts only keep honest people honest; they're not much good when someone is out to rip you off.",1288303144

There's a pervasive attitude amoung attendees of elite universities of feigned modesty, mostly it's fairly innocuous and that's fine. In many cases it's genuine. But this is truly a new level of feigned. The ""hole"" in the writer's education an educational topic, it's a character trait. And this is a flaw he's developed by spending his whole life assuaging his own insecurities by convincing himself it's true. Now there's no doubt that elite universities are breading grounds for this type of thought and students first encountering them must choose whether or not to imbibe in the kool aid. Most do.

1845060,comment,1844221,1844221,0,0,philiphodgen,,,"The legal part of this is trivial.  Form a corporation somewhere.  Delaware.  Meh.  (It is actually slightly more complex than that, but not MUCH more complex).<p>The tax side of this is nontrivial.<p>You sound like you are doing this because you have problems extracting money from your customers.  In other words, you have a business process problem.  If at all possible I would suggest finding a business process solution to your business process problem.<p>Here's why.  You are solving a business process problem with a legal solution.  You are pounding nails with a screwdriver.  It is going to create a tax problem for you.<p>A U.S. corporation (formed in Delaware or anywhere else) is a taxpayer.  The Federal government will be looking for a tax return from this corporation.  (Form 1120, if you want to look at it).  Your money collected from your customers will be flowing into that corporation.  That looks like taxable income to the U.S. government.<p>Now you have replaced your business process problem with a U.S. government tax problem.  That's an order of magnitude worse.  You can solve tax problems, but it takes time and money to do so.  That means lawyers and accountants and paperwork.<p>So now you have replaced your business process problem with a tax problem, and you have solved your tax problem with an ""accountants and lawyers and paperwork and overhead and brain damage"" solution.<p>Is it cost-effective?  Maybe.<p>Then the next thing to consider is State income tax.  The U.S. has a peculiar set-up for income tax.  The Federal government imposes an income tax.  Most of the States impose an income tax.  Some cities also impose an income tax (stay the F away from Philadelphia and New York, for instance).<p>Your Delaware corporation must be doing business SOMEWHERE.  ""Must be somewhere, can't be nowhere.""  So you need a physical presence somewhere for your corporation, even if it is only a glorified Post Office Box.  You put that in a tax-free location.  More money.<p>In summary:  sub-optimal.<p>OK.  If you absolutely have to solve a business process problem with a legal solution, look at this as a possible solution:<p>1.  Check with your tax advisor in Portugal.  What type of entity is your company?  You want it to be taxed as a corporation as defined in U.S. law.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL.  (It doesn't matter how your company is taxed in Portugal.  We're doing U.S. tax engineering here).<p>2.  Form a Delaware limited liability company.  If necessary, file Form 8832 to have the LLC treated as a disregarded entity.<p>3.  Get your authorize.net or whatever account in the name of the Delaware LLC.<p>4.  <the moment of magic> I don't know if this will work or not but if it does, then you win.  You want the Delaware LLC to NOT be a ""permanent establishment"" of your Portuguese corporation as that phrase is defined in the income tax treaty between Portugal and the United States.  See Article 5 of the Treaty if you want to be confused.  :-)<p>5.  The impact of NOT having a permanent establishment in the USA?  Only Portugal can tax your profits.  The USA cannot tax your profits even though they are earned in the USA.<p>6.  The objective you are aiming for is this:<p>- you have a Portuguese corporation deriving profit from U.S. sources.<p>- The money pipelines through a Delaware LLC which is disregarded for tax purposes, so it is as if the Portuguese corporation is doing business directly in the USA for tax purposes.<p>7. You file Form 1120-F for the Portuguese corporation, and attach Form 8833 claiming the benefits of the treaty.<p>- By doing this you are saying to the U.S. tax authorities:  ""Yes, I have U.S.-source profits but the U.S. can only tax those profits if they are derived from a permanent establishment in the USA and my Portuguese corporation does not have a permanent establishment in the USA.  So go bite tires.""<p>That's what I would do.<p>(I do this in real life but I am not your lawyer, this is not legal advice, you'd be a damn fool to rely on random postings on a website to make critical financial and business decisions, etc. etc.)<p>Phil.",1288301638

We are taking a very pragmatic approach to growth but that means that for the time being, that we have to pull a lot of hours for a time to ensure that we are at a point to sustain another hire, when the numbers reflect a sustained volume then we can justify the hire. It also means that because we are growth oriented that we have to take the projects to grow. After we move through this critical point the reserve starts to stack up so that another employee is not such a risky venture. The issue is not only is it bad to burn a client, but it is also just as bad to burn a good developer with on again off again employment. So we want to ensure that once we pick one up that we keep them for the long haul. We have a great reputation as a development house from both clients and employees and we intend to keep it that way. We have to stack up the reserve to do so. The hope is to build the development house on contracts and then pivot into a product company once we have amassed a solid team.

So far on a cursory examination, these new features solve almost all my concurrency problems (at least, from the perspective of a compiler), and should let me throw out a ton of existing code that I've been maintaining. I basically wrote my own cooperative scheduler and infrastructure to do exactly this on top of the iterator features from C#2/3, and it's been a godsend, so it's going to be nice to have it in the compiler :)<p>In particular I'm pleased that instead of dictating that everyone use only cooperative threading or preemptive threading for concurrency, they're exposing both scheduling techniques with easy-to-use APIs that integrate well with each other.

I worked around this by applying subsets of search criteria at a time.  For instance, instead of searching for an Atheist/Agnostic 25-35 making over $50k with an Average or Athletic body type who likes backpacking, exercises 3-4 times per week, and has a graduate degree, I would search for athletic Atheist/Agnostics making over $50k, then search for women with graduate degrees who like backpacking, then maybe widen the age range to 20-40 but apply the rest of the criteria, and so on.  The challenge was to be as inclusive as possible without generating more hits than I wanted to process in one sitting.<p>It was also an interesting odyssey into my own preferences, prejudices, and thought processes.  Sometimes I wasn't interested in getting a lot of results.  Instead, I'd sit down with a desire to explore a very specific search, which often resulted in zero hits.  I'd fiddle with the search until I got a few hits.  One day I met a really pretty girl (not available, unfortunately) who was Indian and kept thinking about how great it would be if she was going on my upcoming backpacking trip with me.  So I did a search for South Asian women who listed backpacking as an interest, and got zero results, none at all in my area, even after I removed all other criteria (18-60+, 4'0""-8'11"", all body types, etc.)  I was intrigued by the result, so I tried other ethnic groups (no black women into backpacking, either, IIRC) and found that East Asian + backpacking produced a set of results that I could process in a reasonable amount of time.  Voila, I found a few interesting profiles and ended up getting a date with one of them.<p>Small result sets always intrigued me.  Searching for women making over $150k turned up a very small set for my area, with a couple of interesting and surprisingly approachable-sounding profiles.  When I broadened my search radius, I found one girl I would have messaged in a heartbeat if she lived closer.  It was strange how often a <i>small</i> result set had a higher density of interesting and compatible profiles, even if the parameters I chose to create it seemed unrelated to my preferences.  The >$150k search surprised the heck out of me; I assumed it would turn up a bunch of women I had no chance with and nothing in common with.  But that was pretty typical for small result sets, at least the ones I tended to produce.  Large result sets contained lots of interesting people, too, but the payoff of interesting profiles per time spent slogging through results was much lower.",1288300410

1844969,comment,1844221,1844221,0,0,adamgries,,,"Hey Guys,<p>In practical terms, unless you become microsoft it probably doesn't matter which state you incorporate in tax-wise. We received advice saying that Delaware is favorable to business in a variety of legal precedents. Also, Delaware runs incorporation as a business, which makes it easy to take care of things online etc..<p>Somebody mentioned Wyoming as having less paperwork but I have to say I've never felt there was much paperwork with Delaware.<p>Without anybody physically present in the US you may need to furnish a bunch of docs - not sure how that would work since we always had one permanent US resident in the company.<p>In our situation we looked at mixed ownership (US and non US) of a business that had worldwide income (mainly from the US).<p>Here are the implications of the different US incorporation strategies we came up with. Remember LLCs are flow through (i.e. the LLC does not pay taxes, but it's owners) vs. C-corps that are not flow through (the company itself has tax obligations). Foreign residents cannot own an S-corp (a corporation with flow through treatment).<p>Incorporation scenarios<p>1. Clean US C-Corp<p>Pro:\neasy to sell company or assets\ntransparent\nstock exit is good and clean\nability to issue stock options<p>Contra:\nGain on asset sale allocable to U.S. taxed at 35% U.S. federal rate\ndouble taxation for asset sales, for U.S. owner (no such problem for foreign owners although there may be tax in your own country)\nIf no asset sale but stock sale instead, purchaser will likely want to reduce purchase price (due to loss of tax benefits)\nsome double taxation for operating profits (some profits from operating income can be offset by bonuses and licensing payments). Double taxation meaning that there is a federal tax on the company and then a tax on any dividends.\nU.S. corp subject to tax on worldwide income.<p>How to handle regular operations:\nUse bonuses and pay for services to zero out operating profits.  Compensation paid to non-U.S. persons for work performed outside the U.S. is not subject to U.S. tax.\nAny dividends paid to non-U.S. shareholders would be subject to U.S. withholding tax - 30% (or less if an applicable treaty applies).<p>2. US LLC with Individual Owners<p>Pro:\neasy to sell company or assets\ntransparent \non asset sale, U.S. owners and Foreign entitled to U.S. 15% capital gains rate for most gain.  One level of tax only.\nfor US owners, profits flow to owners as income and charged regular income tax (+ social security and medicare :( ).  One level of income tax.\n""Profits"" interests can be issued tax-free, which can share in future distributions and appreciation. Can be referred to as LLC units - equivalent to shares.<p>Contra:\ninability to issue stock options (but can issue profits interests as  above)\nIf there are operating profits going to Foreign owners, those owners will be treated as US residents for tax purposes and will be liable to pay full income tax on the profits allocable to the U.S. Also, before any profits are distributed to Foreign owners, the LLC will need to pay to the IRS a 35% withholding tax. However, the Foreign owners can file U.S. tax returns and receive a refund to the extent they are entitled to it.\nOn a sale of assets or LLC units, Foreign owners would be required to pay tax on gain (most at low federal 15% rate)<p>How we would handle regular operations:\nUse bonuses and pay for services to sink zero out operating profits.<p>3. US LLC with Foreign C-Corp owners (i.e. your Portugese C-corp would own the US LLC)<p>Pro:\nSame as in 2.<p>Contra:\ninability to issue stock options (but can issue profits interests as  above)\nany tax issues would shift to these C-corps.  Each c-corp would owe regular U.S. corporate income tax at a 35% rate on any income allocated to it by the LLC (unless offset by expenses).  C corp would also owe a second-level of tax, called the U.S. ""branch"" profits tax (could be 5% or 15% if C Corp is organized in Cyprus; 30% in BVI or any other country with no tax treaty with U.S. - combined 54.5% rate).  But on an exit event and liquidating distribution by the LLC no branch profits tax would have to be paid (this is in comparison with dividends). \nLLC still has to withhold profits allocated to Foreign C corps at 35% rate.<p>How we would handle regular operations:\nSame as in 2.<p>4. US C-Corp that licenses an Offshore company's Technologies<p>Pro:\nU.S. profits offset by royalty payments to offshore entity (this may be hard to do, since profits might fluctuate wildly, and having accompanying fluctuations in royalty payments would be suspect - could base royalty on U.S. revenues).  IRS requires that any royalty be based on fair market value rates.  To be protected, an outside appraisal would be obtained.  A royalty rate of 10% of gross revenues may be in the ballpark, but would have to be confirmed by an appraiser/industry expert.  Maybe your business could justify higher rates.  But IRS audits this area closely.\nProfits of Foreign corp not taxed in U.S. (so long as no services for it are performed in the U.S.) and distributions to non-U.S. owners not taxed in U.S.<p>Contra:\nmore legal and credibility problems when exiting\nDifficult to sell assets\nU.S. has withholding tax on royalties - 30% unless reduced by a tax treaty.  Withholding rate for qualifying Cyprus entity - 0%.  (For all purposes of qualifying for U.S. treaties, the entities must qualify.  For example, if the owners of the Cyprus entity are not Cyprus residents or the entity does not conduct an active business in Cyprus, the Cyprus entity likely would not qualify.  In that case, 30% withholding would be required to be paid by the U.S. licensee (if it does not, IRS can impose penalties). (Same for BVI, which does not have a treaty with the U.S.).\nBad tax result for U.S. seller of original technology.  Under IRS tax rules, a permanent royalty would be imputed.  Each year, the U.S. seller would report income based on the performance of the technology (generally, sales revenues)\nIf Foreign corp develops and owns the technology, and licenses it to U.S. company in exchange for royalty, U.S. owner should not hold 50% or more of the stock of the Foreign corp.  If it does, 50% of the royalty would pass through to the US owner (called subpart F income).  If U.S. owner owns 10% or more of the Foreign corp, and the Foreign corp is not in an active business, then distributions to the U.S. owner will carry a painful interest charge (called PFIC income).  If profits are distributed each year, this aspect would not be too harmful (so the profits could not stay in the company to avoid taxation beyond the end of the tax year since the U.S. owner would be liable for them).  If an active business and U.S. owner owns less than 50%, these passive income rules do not apply.  Key is to determine whether Foreign corp would be treated as having passive income.\nBoth U.S. and Offshore companies have to employ people. The money flowing to the Offshore company is profits only, and will likely not be sufficient to cover significant employee salaries and other expenses; therefore it should be kept to a minimum. However, the Offshore company must employ one or more people to show that it is actually developing that technology for which it is receiving these massive royalties.<p>How we'd do it:\nBVI entity holds IP, U.S. entity operates\nC Corp pays royalties to reduce US profits<p>Hope this helps.

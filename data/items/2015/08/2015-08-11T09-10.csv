10039918,comment,10038547,10039772,0,0,robn_fastmail,,,"> I, for one, am somewhat leery of people reinventing the wheel - especially for a browser-based environment, where everything has a history of being brittle and short-lived.<p>Yeah, so are we (and we even introduce JMAP with the &quot;now you have X standards&quot; XKCD comic). This is our last resort. We&#x27;ve been pushing the limits of what&#x27;s possible with IMAP for years, and we&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that there&#x27;s just some things you cannot do efficiently with it.<p>JMAP is not not just for browsers, though that has been where our focus is so far. I have partial implementations of JMAP for fetchmail and mutt already done (I&#x27;m just trying to find time to finish them and get them out there). Yes, JMAP uses JSON for its data encoding and (currently) HTTP for its transport, but it&#x27;s not inherently browser-based.<p>> IMAP works amazingly well if you&#x27;re using dovecot as a server (including search and push e-mail), and CalDAV/CardDAV also work well if your server actually implements things properly, and projects like Horde have shown you can run and deploy web-based services for them at scale (even though I still regret they&#x27;re using PHP).<p>The problem is, if you&#x27;re not using a server like Dovecot or Cyrus that does implement all the extensions to IMAP that you need to get a modern email experience, then you&#x27;re screwed. Ditto if your client doesn&#x27;t support it. So we end up in the situation where we have all this stuff that is technically IMAP-compliant (ie implements RFC 3501) but gives a half-assed experience to the user.<p>Worse, if you wake up one morning and decide you want to build some amazing new experience on top of standards-compliant email, you&#x27;ll spend the next few months trying to get your mail client bits working correctly before probably giving up. Even if you do get it working, you&#x27;ll still have to work out what to do against servers that don&#x27;t support CONDSTORE and QRESYNC. This is why all these pretty new mail-based apps generally target Gmail exclusively - it&#x27;s a known environment.<p>So that&#x27;s what JMAP is about. Use it and you get a straightforward protocol based on tech you probably already know that supports things you expect in 2015, like push, assistance on flaky networks, battery friendly, etc.<p>> Sure, anything related to DAV has more than a few warts, but my main point here is that things like JMAP won&#x27;t cater to an installed base or deliver benefits across the board until they finish filing all the corners.<p>Do you see anything missing from the spec?<p>We recognise that this doesn&#x27;t work without everyone supporting it, which is part of why we&#x27;re releasing the spec and all this code and talking to every company with an email product that will listen. This won&#x27;t work unless everyone can play and its easy for them to do so. We don&#x27;t want to own this; that doesn&#x27;t help anyone.<p>I don&#x27;t know if JMAP will win. Something has to change though, that I&#x27;m convinced of. The web had its revolution (a couple of times). We think its email&#x27;s turn.",1439286487

In 2008, the practically exploitable security issue in SpeedTouch routers generated some serious media attention in The Netherlands. We had expected that successor and improved routers would be much more secure. However, our study reveals that various modern and massively deployed routers still use weak methods to generate default passwords. Users that did not explicitly changed their wireless password are vulnerable to practical password recovery attacks which enables an adversary to remotely intrude their network within minutes.<p>I guess as long as companies aren&#x27;t held legally accountable for putting users at risk, they&#x27;re not going to change anything.",1439286363

We need to understand this, learn how to spot it, and learn how to deal with it. When a person is in this state they are literally less intelligent and less rational than normal, by an enormous margin. This is by design, because the response is geared toward enabling you to survive a life or death threat. It gives you an edge by preparing you for the worst case scenario and encouraging you to give everything you&#x27;ve got. When you&#x27;re sprinting away or wrestling with a leopard or some such these things matter. You can&#x27;t afford to doubt what you&#x27;re doing or to have second thoughts even for a moment. You are much better off fighting like a feral animal or running like a scared rabbit than intentionally deliberating what to do next, and that affects your survival chances a lot.<p>But we don&#x27;t live in those circumstances any more, yet getting in a heated argument at work, online, or with a significant other still triggers those same responses. But now they are harmful almost all of the time. This is precisely why there is so little rationality in a heated argument, because both sides &quot;have their blood up&quot;, which means they are in the midst of experiencing the fight or flight response. Their body is forcing them to be irrational in the moment, and it just makes things worse.<p>Recognize when this is happening to you, recognize the ways that it&#x27;s common to trigger other people into this sort of thing (e.g. being excessively negative, mean, and confrontational rather than professional and kind) and adjust your communication style accordingly. Also, avoid making the mistake of continuing a heated argument while you are under the influence of fight or flight. Take a break, take a walk, come back to the subject later when you have the opportunity to be rational.<p>Justified anger can actually have a positive effect if used well, but irrational, seething, mindless, feral anger will just spread irrationality and is generally unproductive or actively harmful.<p>I would highly recommend everyone read a book called &quot;Crucial Conversation&quot; about precisely this subject and how to ensure that you not only communicate well and rationally to others but they feel safe doing so with you.",1439283750

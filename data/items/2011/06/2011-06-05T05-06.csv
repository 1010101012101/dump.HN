2621424,comment,2620486,2620486,2,0,pbreit,,,"I worry about Groupon but not for the reasons here. Regarding the financials, it could easily ratchet down acquisition and marketing spend and be very profitable. The barriers to entry arguments are very superficial. Sure, just programming a competing service and closing a few merchants is not that hard. But building an 8 figure mailing list is not easy. Finally, some suspected and I'm inclined to agree that the otherwise ridiculous payoff of early investors and employees might be explainable as necessary to turn down the Google offer.<p>My main concern about Groupon is the core proposition may not actually work in the long term. There are all sorts of problems with fatigue, inherently cheapskate customers, high rates of existing customers, worsening economics, etc.",1307253497

But you could leverage off universities to offer recent grads a chance to compete for say three spots at each univesity.<p>I wouldn't let the universities choose them (really bad idea) but they could provide space and help manage the program.  Let them all live in a dorm room and the universities cost would be minimal.<p>Let Microsoft take 10% of each company and then offer the university 20% of their equity.  I think there's a pretty good chance that a few giants would emerge.

2621388,comment,2620872,2620872,1,0,barrkel,,,"On the topic of loops which end in a break (""Most egregious is the loop whose last statement is break;!""): this can be useful for avoiding contorted control flow when you have a switch statement inside the loop. Instead of coding:<p><pre><code>    cont = 1;
    while (cont)
    {
        foo = bar();
        switch (foo)
        {
            case 0:
                cont = 0;
                break;
            default:
                // other work
                break;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
You can do this instead:<p><pre><code>    for (;;)
    {
        foo = bar();
        switch (foo)
        {
            case 0:

            default:
                // other work
                continue;
        }
        break;
    }
</code></pre>
IMO the idiom, once you're used to it, reads better.<p>(Yes, I know you can reduce the lines further e.g. putting foo=bar() into the for statement, but it's the multi-level break I'm focused on here.)",1307251552

Second, I asked Guy Kawasaki to autograph my MacBook. He obliged. I put a clear Spec Case over the lid to protect the signatures.<p>People now ask me about the 2 autographs and the typical what, why, when questions. People I dont even know come up to me and ask me about the autographs and who signed it.<p>I got to thinking, I wonder just how much word of mouth would get people to sign up for products.<p>So my quest is to collect a few more autographs. When someone asks me about the signatures I will tell them about it in as much detail as they want.<p>So here is a chance to promote potential business. Autograph the lid to my MacBook and  I will promote your business. I am in San Jose but would be willing to meet where ever to execute.<p>Here are some people/companies that I would be interested in promoting since I use/believe in the service.<p>Drew Houston / DropBox<p>Jack Dorsey or Ev or Biz / Twitter<p>Kevin Rose / Foundat.io/n<p>Tony Conrad / About.me<p>Phillip Rosedale / SecondLife<p>If you are not on this list, but interested, hit me up. E-Mail in Profile.<p>Lets promote word of mouth business....",1307250506

Groupon has a list of a few thousand merchants, a few million emails, 8000 employees, and sells a dollar for fifty cents. How can you scale with so many employees and ever be profitable? It's not sustainable at all. They have no patents or any semblance of a defensive moat. Groupon is also declining in the cities it first launched in like Boston. Their future does not look good.",1307250247

In the west we have built our civil systems around that theory.<p>What are we risking by not having this transparency on HN?  By not having transparency on what accounts are banned, and why?  Only the value of the discourse that occurs here.<p>If the value of the communications that happen here is high enough, our interest in having protections for that communication should be just as high.<p>If the value of this discourse is low, why are we putting on airs and pretending we need harsh measures, such as slowbanning, to protect it?<p>Sooner or later, any human, even one as benevolent as pg, will abuse their power over others.  We need access to the reasons that accounts are secretly banned or slowbanned, so that we can pressure moderators (or whoever has that power) to wield the punishments fairly, and petition for unfair punishments to be reversed.",1307250051

Myself included, many Hacker News readers would probably be in the BS-detecting, questioning, critical category of students. However, I personally really think that every school child can become great at something, regardless of whether they are the little questioners in the classroom or not. And I personally think that an education system that labels children into ""regular"" and ""advanced"" is not a good idea, because it really hurts the self-esteem of the ""regular"" students.<p>My point is: different flavors, different emphasis, different difficulty in homework among the essentially same-subject classes is fine. However, we should phrase education as an experience with choices, especially for pre-college (because their personalities are very malleable, imo), instead of making kids feel like they are laggards.",1307250016

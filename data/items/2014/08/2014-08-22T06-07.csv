8211150,comment,8210507,8210507,3,0,koonsolo,,,"The need to estimate highly depends on whether you are developing a project or a product. On a project, the customer always wants to know <i>what</i> will be done at which <i>date</i>, and how much that would <i>cost</i>.<p>A product however, can be released &quot;when it&#x27;s done&quot;, so there is no real need to estimate. The additional benefit is also that it can be released when the developers feel that the product is ready for release, unlike a project, where there is a lot of pressure to deliver things.<p>My personal view (and experience) is that developing without estimates saves time and creates a higher quality product. But other (smart) developers that I know like to work within estimates because they think it pushes everyone to deliver things.<p>We probably are both right, because there is yet another factor that comes into play when choosing to estimate or not: motivation of the developers. Highly motivated developers who love their job, rather work in their code instead of goofing off on the internet. But when the project/product is not that special, and not everyone feels passionate about it, estimating and follow-up is probably preferred to put a little pressure on getting things done.",1408690517

8211120,comment,8209991,8209991,1,0,inflagranti,,,"I see this explicitly argument being made more and more recently. A language is better because it’s more explicit and hence easier for people to understand. I think it’s completely wrong. If you want to be <i>really</i> explicit, use assembler. But everyone would argue that this is <i>too</i> explicit and <i>harder</i> to understand. So definitely explicitly in itself in a language is not intrinsically better.<p>What I think this whole argument is about is levels of abstraction. By saying language A is more explicit then B and hence easier to understand, what he really means is that language A is on exactly that level of abstraction that makes most sense to him. It might even mean that it makes most sense to most developers and he does mention the bell curve, but I think that discussion is still out.<p>Personally I would argue that Scala, Rust, D and at the very extreme Scala are <i>not</i> too high level, it’s just that most developers nowadays learned programming in something like C, Java (pre 8) or C++ (pre 11) and hence are used to that level of abstraction that feels natural to them. I’m confident though that a next generation, learning early on more functional constructs that are more and more pervasive in newer languages and also newer version of “old” languages (Java, C++) will feel natural to them and the “right” level of abstraction.",1408689388

I was building scripts that would allow the team of developers to transition to a different OS with minimal time and effort. It sounds just like a &quot;dependency management engineer&quot; job, I guess :) But I certainly wouldn&#x27;t write off this time as wasted — learned a big chunk of info that would allow me to feel more confident and independent on this new platform. Quite a bonus!<p>As for the code simplicity, I think your approach is very mature and solid. Like a joke has it: expert developer says &quot;this doesn&#x27;t work, let me remove something&quot;; novice developer says &quot;this doesn&#x27;t work, let me add something&quot;.<p>Cheers,\noley",1408688539

If you fly following surface streets you remove a lot of the &quot;drone falling on someone possibility&quot; and insurance can handle damage to cars if something were to go wrong. Keep in mind they can also be fitted with parachutes and airbags that can be deployed for safety.<p>Right now the biggest holdbacks are losing GPS lock (flyaways are not fun) sense and avoid (don&#x27;t hit stuff) and battery life.<p>You can easily build a multicopter with current tech able to fly 5km+ and back in under 10min (I&#x27;ve done it) the issue is that due to the weight of the batteries you don&#x27;t end up with much payload left to speak of. As better battery tech is rolled out and other stated problems are solved drone based logistics will be viable, I give it 5 maybe 10 years max and am very bullish on it.",1408688103

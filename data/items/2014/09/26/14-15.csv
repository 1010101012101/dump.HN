But a lot of players are students; they often can afford to sleep &#x27;till noon.<p>People also often organize at more humane hours, like early evening during the week or around noon during weekend. The thing about 4-am actions is that they&#x27;re based on the expectation that the other team will be asleep. There&#x27;s a big imbalance of power favouring offense over defense, so if your team is setting up a farm (quickly turning all portals in a portal-dense area into maximum level and installing protection mods), it can take one or two opposing players to undo the work of ten from your team.",1411743598

Dropcam, for example, made it an explicit part of their culture that employees work a focused 40 hour work week and have dinner with family and friends outside of the office. The CEO believes that startups who offer dinner at work are basically manipulating employees to work late into the night [1]. Did these sane, healthy work policies hold Dropcam back from massive success? Nope. It was acquired for half a billion dollars [2]. For the sake of our team members and employees, I think we would do well to emulate Dropcam.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/04/23/dropcam-ceos-beef-with-brogramming-late-nights-and-free-dinners/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/04/23/dropcam-ceos...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/google-and-nest-acquire-dropcam-for-555-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/google-and-nest-acquire-dro...</a>",1411743580

Indigenous people hunted, fished, and gathered every year for generations. Through direct observation, they noticed many patterns. When you hunted the same area too consistently, fewer animals came back in the following seasons. So they came up with a belief system along the lines of, &quot;If you hunt too much, you have offended the animals, and you must stop hunting for several seasons until they return.&quot;<p>The scientific approach makes the same observation, and the same recommendations, from a different explanation.

Say that you were thinking more in the 120,000 range.<p>Do people really counter with salaries that are 50% higher than the initial offer?  Maybe it is just the nature of the employers I have dealt with in the past, but I have always felt anything in excess of the 5% - 10% range just meant that you and the company were too far off in expectations for a deal to work.  In fact, a few months ago I rejected a seriously lowball offer where the difference was similar to the numbers you posted; I didn&#x27;t even bother to counter.  Is it really common to get companies to move by double-digit percentages on initial offers?<p>Edit: I should point out that people at this company had already told me how hard it was to find qualified people.  There were plenty of other indications that they could not afford to be throwing away candidates.",1411743361

That&#x27;s shitty logic, so let&#x27;s go with gut feeling for now...<p>I don&#x27;t believe that the same specific bug has manifested itself across many many different HFT algorithms run by many different actors over a long period of time, in a way that loses money consistently for everyone involved whenever the bug is triggered, without ever being addressed by anyone.<p>To argue otherwise is contrary to my current understanding of software engineering best practices - imagine another industry where every service provider has the same bug manifest in the same way, across all their different software stacks - some running Java, some Python, some even with their own proprietary languages -  and no one ever catches it even though it&#x27;s losing money and it&#x27;s occurence is easily identifiable on a time-series graph (so very easy to be matched up with all available logging data)? No one has the resources to throw a team of devs at this for 6 months to identify the bug, or they do and they&#x27;re just willing to lose money and not make every last nickel they can? Not a single person is trying to reach for that lost money with a bug fix or a novel tweak to their own existing algo? For years?<p>I believe it&#x27;s more likely that either the actors who are quote stuffing believe they are benefiting by tipping their hand early with false information, or they actually are benefiting.<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine how these actors could be benefiting; perhaps they believe that someone is watching their quotes in transit or has visibility into their quotes before trades are executed, and the quote-stuffers are trying to fake these malicious actors out?<p>The alternative scenario where quote-stuffers are not benefiting from their actions - or rather, that they aren&#x27;t even operating under the irrational assumption that they are benefiting (because the quote stuffers could be stuffing intentionally but incorrectly) - seems much more implausible.<p>It seems to involve a whole lot more things going wrong in a very specific very atypical way,from a software development standpoint, with no one every interested in picking up the money they&#x27;re dropping on the floor due to this bug when things go wrong, over the course of years, even though all the data to pinpoint the source of the bug is public, charted, and discussed openly.<p>The first scenario just requires a quote stuffer to hold a possibly incorrect belief about the other actors in the market. The second requires multiple specific distinct software development failures to line up like dominoes and stay lined up without anyone ever addressing their root causes.<p>But who knows :) <shrug> Trading is chaos, after all.",1411742520

And even Moses&#x27; writing in Genesis 2 shows us the creation of man, and then plants, and then woman, which would place the day 3 creation of plants firmly in the middle of day 6.  This suggests that what is meant by &quot;day&quot; isn&#x27;t what we&#x27;re inclined to think of in our 21st century mindset.<p>Moses was adopted to Egyptian royalty, and wrote a creation account that subverts the Egyptian account.

They will have a maximum price in their head.  So, determine that maximum price.<p>Assume that since you&#x27;ve gotten to the negotiation phase, you&#x27;ve exceeded their expectations.<p>Ask, &#x27;how many people are you hiring?&#x27;  If it&#x27;s more than one, at the same position, then they may have more demand.  It also may imply that their budget for hiring is above average.<p>Ask, &#x27;how difficult has your interviewing been?&#x27;  If it&#x27;s been difficult, and you&#x27;ve reached this stage, then your in a better position for negotiation.<p>Ask, &#x27;what have been your main criteria in hiring?&#x27;  If it points to a rare skill that you have or some background experience or knowledge that is unique, then you&#x27;re in a better position.<p>Ask, &#x27;are there any other candidates that you&#x27;re interviewing, and how do I measure up?&#x27;  If there are no other candidates, and/or you&#x27;re the best candidate that they have, then you&#x27;re in a better position.<p>Ask, &#x27;do you have upcoming milestones or deadlines?&#x27;  If so, then may have higher immediate demand.<p>Ask, &#x27;what are your goals in hiring me?&#x27;  If they want to put you to work immediately, then you&#x27;re in a better position.  If they are primarily interested in grooming you, they may have more patience to hire.<p>Ask, &#x27;who approves the hiring, and are you able to hire me today?&#x27;  If someone else approves, it may be a harder negotiation.  If they can hire you immediately, then you&#x27;re in a better position.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t set your price, first.  If they ask, &#x27;what is your price?&#x27;, ask them &#x27;what is your typical range for this type of position?&#x27;  Get them to offer their price first because it&#x27;s always on the lower end of what their range is.  Then, consider your position.  Ask for something that is slightly outrageous.  For example, let&#x27;s say you determine that you&#x27;re in a good position.  They offer you 80,000.  Say that you were thinking more in the 120,000 range.  Read their reaction to that.  If they seem offended, say &#x27;but, that can be negotiable, based on your benefits, etc.&#x27;  Then, talk to them about the other benefits of the position, and come down slightly.  But, once your initial price is set, that will be the baseline for further discussions.<p>Always come to the table with as much information as possible.<p>Always ask for add-ons.  Ask for more non-financial benefits.  Ask for more vacation.  Ask for a more flexible schedule.  If it&#x27;s a big company, you&#x27;re not in a good position to ask for extras, however.<p>Tell them that you&#x27;ll give them an answer very soon, and set a specific date.  It will show that you&#x27;re serious.  If you plan wisely, you can have multiple offers from different companies at similar time.  Use these other offers to both gauge the demand and to play each offer against other offers.<p>And, remember, it&#x27;s always supply and demand.",1411741957

Don’t get me wrong—I’m ut\u00ADterly grate\u00ADful. But it’s coun\u00ADter\u00ADin\u00ADtu\u00ADitive: I never ex\u00ADpected that the cheaper op\u00ADtion would be so much less pop\u00ADu\u00ADlar. Econ\u00ADo\u00ADmists, I in\u00ADvite your explanations.&quot;<p>This is not surprising to me at all. There are multiple reasons why the font sale is easier to make.<p>The whole book is an excellent sales pitch for the fonts. It&#x27;s hard to believe you didn&#x27;t design it that way, because you did everything right. You establish credibility as an expert. You give the reader a gift of useful information. You explain at length the value of the product. You even help the reader see herself as someone who&#x27;s savvy enough to buy the product (copy like: &quot;You are not apathetic&quot; in the Times New Roman page.)<p>So you have a great sales pitch for the fonts. Whereas the donation suffers in comparison. There&#x27;s no quid pro quo -- I understand you see the book itself as the value they&#x27;d be paying for, but that value is already in the past by the time they&#x27;re deciding to donate. It changes the psychology.<p>Also, plenty of people can plunk down a company card to buy a font (or a book). It&#x27;s a legitimate business expense that&#x27;s easy to justify. It can be much harder to justify a &quot;donation&quot; to a random author on the internet. For this reason alone, you&#x27;d be better off changing &quot;donation&quot; to an e-book sale, even if the e-book is just the same content as the website.",1411741510

8372726,comment,8372630,8372630,1,0,tokenadult,,,"We discuss hiring frequently here on Hacker News. Almost everyone who reads this site has looked for a job at least once before, and many people who read this site have had occasion to hire someone into a company. I read the new blog post kindly submitted here after noticing how fast it was gaining upvotes, and I see a list of gripes with the tech hiring process that we have discussed many times before here on Hacker News. But the author buries the lede by putting his best point, point 10, at the bottom of his ten-point list. That point,<p>&quot;10. Not challenging/testing candidates<p>&quot;When you’re recruiting in tech it’s crucial to test your candidates.&quot;<p>is the most important point, and it generalizes to all kinds of hiring. A well liked FAQ post I have posted to comment threads before here on HN notes (shortening here)<p>&quot;The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, &#x27;The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,&#x27;[1]  Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274 sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the <i>huge</i> peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, personality tests, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.[2]<p>&quot;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: If you are hiring for any kind of job in the United States, with its legal rules about hiring, prefer a work-sample test as your hiring procedure. If you are hiring in most other parts of the world, use a work-sample test in combination with a general mental ability test.<p>&quot;The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well. One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. (But the calculated validity of each of the two best kinds of procedures, standing alone, is only 0.54 for work sample tests and 0.51 for general mental ability tests.) Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it&#x27;s a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.&quot;<p>Note that a work-sample test can be a lot less time-consuming, and lot more possible to standardize, than some of the procedures suggested in the blog post submitted today.<p>The author of the blog post writes, &quot;Regular work: have your candidate work a couple of afternoons or days side-by-side with a team member. I’ve seen companies like Automattic asking for candidates to come work with them for several days (and paying them for their work of course).&quot;<p>Previous comments from Hacker News participants suggest that that procedure takes too long for many competent job-seekers to be willing to do that. It probably also has the defect of not allowing objective comparisons between different job candidates.<p>&quot;Live tech testing: having a series of live tech tests or a technical questionnaire with a couple of tech employees from your company.&quot;<p>Maybe &quot;live&quot; is not the key idea here so much as &quot;genuine,&quot; and it may be better still to have the test be standardized to compare applicants well.<p>&quot;Moonlighting: creating a mini-project within your company for the candidate to perform. Give him/her a deadline and analyse the results.&quot;<p>This has the same problem as the first suggestion: lots of time commitment required from the applicant, with little comparability among different applicants (depending on the nature of the task).<p>The list of common mistakes is suggestive of problems, but if you&#x27;d like a better list of answers about what to do about them, see another recent thread here on HN[1] and the various comments there.<p>AFTER EDIT: It looks like the main post here is receiving a penalty either from user flags (not from me) or from detection of a voting ring. Maybe I&#x27;ll be the only person to discuss this post today.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8232746"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8232746</a>",1411740832

Early media studies found people liked the companionship of a radio announcer, and would sometimes have it on just to listen and feel like someone is there with them. This is exaggerated even more on podcasts where you get to control when and where you listen, making it even more personal, and in some cases, shows record live and you can dialog with the podcasters during. If getting an on-air reply to something isn&#x27;t a relationship, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking of relationship in the term of something like a parent or significant other.

The idea was that people would start &quot;hanging out&quot; in each other&#x27;s web spaces, like dorm rooms.<p>I was skeptical of this but (as a Googler, and at the time, a drinker of the Kool-Aid) I wanted to see it work. Hence, my suggestion that (a) we re-orient G+ Games around high-quality games (such as German-style board games, 2D adventures and collaborative RPGs, etc.) instead of giving preferential treatment to Zyngarbage, and (b) integrate high-quality games (which we didn&#x27;t have, but third-party developers will build them if you create the platform) with Hangouts. I <i>knew</i> people wouldn&#x27;t &quot;Hangout&quot; just to watch Youtube videos (really, who wants to hear others&#x27; reactions to YT videos? the comments are horrific enough without having to hear associated voices) but I figured that a high-quality game experience around truly <i>social</i> games (not anti-social Zyngarbage that merely marketed itself through social networks, like Farmville back when Zynga was more obviously Facebook&#x27;s Tapeworm) gave Hangouts a chance of looking more like that original vision. A high-quality and social German-style board game experience is one thing that <i>would</i> get a critical core of tech-savvy people using Hangouts for multiple hours per day.<p>Then... I was erroneously tagged as a union activist and my psychotic manager at the time had a field day with the &quot;make &#x27;im quit&quot; game, but no need to say more on that. The Internet has had more than two lunches on that one.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to see Google making this ambitious of a venture into games and the concept of a game.

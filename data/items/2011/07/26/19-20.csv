Claims of Israeli prosecution are greatly and often exaggerated by Chomsky amongst others.<p>Indeed the Palestinians have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity to find peace with Israel. Notice that in this attempt, they are asking for statehood without mentioning their willingness to end the government funded (and thus foreign aid funded) indoctrination of children into hatred, both in Gaza and the West Bank. This attempt to unilaterally declare statehood is a negotiation tactic--to not negotiate.<p>What's the next step? If this passes and Hamas still does not revise their charter, calling for the ""obliteration of Israel"", what will Israel be able to negotiate with in exchange for peace? Tel Aviv? All of Jerusalem?<p>And this doesn't take into account the absolutely ridiculous notion of any country exchanging tangible land for an intangible promise of a cessation of terrorism.<p>The fact that so many countries support this initiative paints a bleak picture about the world's willingness to sell out a country in exchange for favor in the eyes of the resource abundant Middle Eastern nations.",1311710341

2809196,comment,2807796,2807796,13,0,blahedo,,,"I'm so glad to see this message out there; a frustratingly small number of people are aware of the 1984(ish) peak in females in the field.  My mom taught computer programming (Fortran) in a Chicago high school from 1967 until 1984, and was actually kind of surprised when I first asked her about gender balance issues in the field—they just weren't an issue then, and her classes were always more or less balanced.<p>But what they also were was everyone's very first exposure to a computer.  Without exception, her students had never written any sort of program before, and they were recruited from good students in the math and physics classes, coming to programming with an open mind and no preconceptions.  (A <i>lot</i> of them, girls and boys both, went into technical computer-related fields.)<p>The change, as has been noted elsewhere on this page, surely has to do with the introduction of computers, but my hypothesis is that it wasn't just home PCs (not in the 80s) but classroom PCs that were the problem: in a lot of places, computers in the classroom were a fad and showed up with no training of the teachers, so they sat in the back or the side, mostly unused... unless one or two of the students pestered the teacher to play with the computer, and then used the manual and/or trial and error to figure it out.  Guess which students were doing that more?<p>But that, I think, wouldn't be enough.  The knowledge should equalise after one or maybe two terms of college CS, right?  But I'm pretty sure the real problem was that professors inadvertently reinforced and magnified the difference between students who'd had previous computer experience (primarily boys) and students who hadn't (of both genders).  It turns out that as a teacher, it's very, <i>very</i> easy to look around the classroom, see that X% of the students seem to be getting something, and decide to move on.  (You can't wait for 100%, usually, so it's always a judgement call.)  That's fine if it's something you've taught well and only the weak students are struggling, but what if it's something you absentmindedly glossed over?  Half the class understands it, so you must have covered it, right?  This is very insidious, and even being aware of it is not always enough to combat it; and if the divide of ""has experience"" vs ""no experience"" partially reflects a gender divide, that divide will only get reinforced.",1311710041

Even more, you can make simple Web View wrapper and publish them to Market, App Store, etc. Surely, surely, you're not really sitting there saying they have to build some new manifest and packaging format to support web apps... in their NATIVE application store, right? The entire point of web apps is that you don't need the concept of an ""app"". The app is the webpage as it's displayed in the browser. If you want to avoid that perception issue, then use an embedded web view wrapper.<p>My point was that all of these functionalities and abilities are in existence RIGHT NOW in (at least) the WebKit browsers.

That's what real Monopoly is about in my book: deal-making rather than gambling on the dice.<p>For example, if one player owns all the railroads, the rent is higher for each railroad.  So, a common deal would be to ""give"" all the railroads to a single player, and that player would then divide the greater spoils.<p>Similar ""pool"" deals could be made to collect properties without needing to hope that you got them all by luck, or making similar deals to block other players.<p>There are also a large number of books that talk about Monopoly strategy and even analyze it statistically.<p>Needless to say, with these rules the game could easily become 'contentious'!",1311709963

Indeed, Windows 8 is pushing support for such technologies and actually supporting a move away from framework based technologies to the HCJ combo. Even now with the popularity of HTML5 API's and NodeJS - the push away from traditional frameworks is becomming evident. Just look at Silverlight/Flash as sources of this - MSFT touted Silverlight as the ""new future"" and now its all but giving it the big middle finger.<p>Is this a good thing ? I think that Google and Apple are intent on killing Microsoft and Adobe respectively and they believe the best way is to strike at their respective hearts is by reducing their core platform reliance.

They compete early on (in college and in medical school) so they wouldn't have to compete later when they enter the workspace. I think that the promise of job security (guaranteed employment) has a particular appeal to women. I suspect that their thinking is that once they graduate, they can relax at the high-paying secure job and invest their time and resources into growing children. On the other hand, to me, as a young man looking to enter the startup field, ventures with ongoing high risk and high payoff appeal more than employment guarantees.<p>I dropped out of premed and started programming and studying art sometime in college partly because I was turned off by people whose primary career motivation was job security and who did not have any serious creative pursuits besides their career goals.",1311707699

My opinion is Google has some amazing marketing and social skills to power that kind of sentiment shift.  The big thing that rarely comes up in those threads is that Mozilla is a community.  There are memory bugs that have been open in bugzilla for years, but there have been various people in the community working on them, sometimes in their spare time, for years as well.  You look at the scope of the project, and it isn't small. It certainly isn't a hack project someone can commit a quick patch to in a day.. There are certainly paid Mozilla employees working on the code base every day, but the number doesn't compare with any of the other major browser vendors.  The FirefoxFlippers™ rarely ever follow up with something like, ""I tried to look at the problem and realized what a difficult thing memory management is so I took the easy path and decided to let some profit based vendor do it for me and hope that they treat me well.""<p>My personal and probably bias experience is that I have <i>never</i> felt a memory issue.  I tend to run a lot of add-ons and I only rarely keep a lot of tabs open because I prefer to follow a pattern of opening up a bunch of things then working my way back down to zero.  I feel that most memory issues are related to bad add-ons, bad plug-ins, or bad websites, and I am very happy with the new about:memory stats that show up in Aurora. I just hope that some of the FirefoxFlippers™ who aren't just trolling for Google might take a moment to try out their easily repeatable excessive memory use-cases and drop us a line so we can work together with the community to get rid of them.<p>I'll now take my downmodding for ranting on a post with a comment that is only tangentially related to the topic. :/",1311707659

I have often wondered if it would be better to have cofounders who aren't as strong but as a team we have all bases, in terms of skills, covered vs. all of us, with roughly the same skills, but all awesome.<p>I also started to notice that there isn't any correlation between skill and determination. Looking for skill and hoping for will is a disaster. People who were ""really into it"" would pick anything up on the fly, enough to be dangerous, and that'd be great. On the flip side, people who were ""rockstars"" but not driven, would not do what they say they would, you'd be waiting on their email responses, man did they kill the morale. Reminds me of a Sir Richard Bronson quote: Hire for attitude, train for skill.<p>I would bet the combination of determination and ""solving the right problem"" makes a winner. Also instead of luck, I believe in being at the right place, at the right time.

3060908,comment,3060105,3060861,22,0,kinofcain,,,"Rail operators are occasionally able to get waivers from the FRA to run non-compliant rolling stock. Caltrain was awarded such a waiver for a future rolling stock purchase, and the Sprinter was awarded one as well. Typically the FRA requires that there be some sort of temporal separation between the trains, which could mean freight only running at night, or it could mean all trains on the line have some form of electronic PTC (positive train control) that guarantees separation between trains. The freight lines have been fighting PTC for several decades, but they're finally being forced to implement it (of course the FRA hasn't set much of a standard, so there's going to be a dozen different incompatible systems, yay).<p>The problem is that the waivers are arbitrary and one-offs. There's no standard for light passenger rail in the US, there's just a bunch of hyper-specific waivers for each case and operators must re-apply if their rolling stock changes. So if caltrain wanted to switch from UIC-compliant Siemens Desiro trains to a UIC-compliant hitachi train, they'd have to apply for another waiver.<p>To top it all off, the FRA's own studies showed that their ""buff strength"" standards are more dangerous than the more modern energy-absorbing crash structures mandated on European and Japanese lines.<p>The FRA really does need to be reformed.",1317498124

3060861,comment,3060105,3060105,35,0,kposehn,,,"Ok, as someone who has long been very close to the rail industry, a few points:<p>1. ""...the Long Island Commuter Railroad (LIRR) in New York City, which has no freight traffic"" - Incorrect. The LIRR also is host to the New York & Atlantic railway, a freight line which does indeed operate on LIRR lines daily. Average train gross weight is about 1,200 tons for each freight on that line, not 100 tons.<p>2. ""FRA staffers point out that it is unfair to compare US buffering standards with those in Europe because passenger rail in the US has to contend with more (and heavier) freight traffic."" - They are quite right to do so. The US plays host to the highest density of freight rail traffic in the world with most trains exceeding 5,000 tons (some closer to 15,000).<p>3. ""In both Europe and Japan, a competitive business exists in the DMU marketplace. But that market is off limits to US transit agencies because the FRA has effectively created a trade embargo."" - Incorrect. In San Diego, the Sprinter lines use Siemens Desiro DMU's, a light design totally unadapted for the US Rail network as far as weight goes. The line also plays host to freight trains at night. How they got around the weight requirement, I do not know. Furthermore, the San Diego Trolley has the line from downtown to El Cajon by way of Lemon Grove. That line also plays host to freight at night - a streetcar line! The market is indeed open, but the trick agencies use to get around the requirement is a bigger question.<p>4. ""The FRA proposed rule would only allow Quiet Zones exemptions at crossings that had been improved with ""four-quadrant"" gates and curb medians."" - for good reason! Many fatalities happen at grade crossings and horns are one of the only really efficient ways to keep people off the tracks. Most other nations have few crossings, preferring grade-separated rights-of-way. However, in the US, drivers are often grossly idiotic and don't pay attention. Not how many grade crossing accidents you see on YouTube...<p>That said, it is indeed a major issue that the FRA rules apply to any rail line connected to the freight network that spans the nation. It would be far better if the regulations made clear exceptions for trains on passenger-only lines, hours of operation, etc.<p>For example, let's look at CalTrain. The main line up the peninsula only sees freight traffic at night. By setting operational rules that restrict speeds near freight trains, etc, this would allow much better equipment for CalTrain while continuing to let freight run at specific times.<p>The FRA very much needs to get with the program and allow better conditional standards.",1317496919

3060816,comment,3060105,3060630,2,0,masklinn,,,"> I don't think I've ever (well, maybe once or twice) read about a TGV accident.<p>There are accidents pretty regularly (thought not frequently, it's about once every two years). Most accidents are not really mentioned because they're level-crossing (some truck barreled through the level crossing on low-speed regional tracks, got stuck and the train smashed into it at 100~150km/h). The result is usually that the truck or car gets annihilated and the train is due for repairs.<p>A more interesting incident type is the derailment (especially high-speed), and while that has happened several times the record of the TGV on these has been stellar: it was hinted at in the article, a TGV behaves very much like a solid object, it's a single coherent structure and the cars are very tightly bonded together (that's a major difference between TGV and ICE). As a result a TGV is <i>extremely rigid</i>, and in all derailments so far the derailment was partial (a bogie to a few cars) and the rigidity of the trainset is credited with keeping the train as a whole on the tracks even though some cars were not in contact.<p>FWIW, TGV has the (dubious) award of highest-speed derailment from 1993: a trainset hit an unsupported rail section (a sinkhole had opened under a track after days of heavy rains resulting in a hole 7 meters long by 4 wide and 1.5m high) at 294km/h (185mph). 4 cars and the rear power unit derailed (a TGV trainset is 2 power units and 8 to 10 cars, this was a ""TGV Rseau"" trainset so 2/8, meaning half the train was off the rails), the train remained upright and managed to stop (over 2.3km). One passenger injury and one passenger was treated for shock.",1317495966

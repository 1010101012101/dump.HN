Contrary to the claims of the author, the business environment did change between 2006 and when Google decided to leave.  Brin's recent interview covered that exact topic.<p>Furthermore, this piece missed the point that while Google did block banned content, it's approach to doing so was very different from that of Baidu.  Google included notices that results were removed and links briefly explaining why.<p>><i>The rest of the article devolves into an even more ridiculous assertion: that Google is somehow innately better at innovating than domestic companies, and thus, the internet market will stagnate as domestic companies sit around copying each other’s old technologies rather than moving forward. Google does have a history of innovation, of course, but are Chinese companies really fundamentally incapable of this? I reject that notion as stupid — and probably also a bit racist — but I suppose we’ll see for sure in the long run.</i><p>That idea would be stupid, but it's a strawman.  The NYT piece didn't make any claims or speculation whatsoever on ""inherent"" or ""fundamental"" abilities.  What the author <i>may</i> have been getting at was how strongly economic growth is related to openness, particularly in regards to technology.  At the end of the industrial revolution, China and India represented about 40% of the global economy, far more than today.  Many non-racist people would argue that the reason Japan and the west did so well last century was the freedom and incentive to innovate.

There are lots of examples, going back as far in history as you'd like, of state secrets serving a necessary and important role. Even averting war.<p>So my question to the wikileaks folks is this: where's the line? Would you publish anything, and the more secret the better? Or is there some kind of rule you use? Would you publish nuclear launch codes? The identities of spies in countries that would execute them for it?<p>There is way, way, way too much secrecy in the world, especially among U.S. Agencies. They classify anything they want, and the biggest reason is political CYA. Having said that, I can't give carte blanche to Wikileaks either.

The simple Bayesian posterior mean one I mentioned yesterday is pretty simple: suppose you have a1,a2,...,ak ratings with 1,2,...,k stars; then the posterior mean number of stars is [(1+a1).1 + (1+a2).2 + ... + (1+ak).k] / [(1+a1) + (1+a2) + ... + (1+ak)]. (Of course the denominator can be written more briefly, but I think it's clearer that way.) Equivalently, you just calculate the average star count, but you add in a bunch of fictitious reviews, one with each possible number of stars. Once again, by adjusting the number of each kind of fictitious review you can (e.g.) make less-reviewed items do better or worse relative to more-reviewed ones; by changing the coefficients that are 1,2,...,k above you can (e.g.) make a 5-star review more than 5/4 as good as a 4-star one; etc.",1269609735

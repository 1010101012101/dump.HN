Anything by Jeff Atwood<p>3. <i>Jeff Atwood was wrong in that blog post, and also he's an idiot.</i><p>4. <i>How I made my startup (succeed|fail) by working 114 hours a day and eating only cardboard and pocket lint.</i><p>4a. <i>How we built a web app in 4 minutes for only $0.37</i><p>5. <i>Being a (programmer|hacker|founder) is teh awesome.</i><p>Not saying that all the articles are on those subjects, but they are HN gold, that's for sure.  If you could somehow work some of these topics in to your question, it might do better.",1216195065

247418,comment,247211,247211,0,0,s3graham,,,"I guess the ""Turing"" part of the name was a bit hopeful. Are the attacks actually doing OCR, or are they brute-forced against a database somehow? (or maybe those are the same thing these days?)<p>I guess anything that's widespread enough will make cracking it valuable enough to get someone to work around it, but it seems like we could probably come up with something that was quite a lot more human-y requiring?<p>Language understanding? Whatever it is that AI PHD students are failing to solve these days?",1216194207

He says, ""Such and such will help you understand closures"" and then a few lines of python, then suddenly, ""because start_pos is a closure"".<p>Which, really, still doesn't explain what he means. That and for the love of god, I hate things such as Clojure. Call me a stick in the mud, but I like languages in which I don't have to mentally expand 80% of words.",1216193427
247412,comment,247016,247262,0,0,philh,,,"When I'm searching for a solution to a problem, I often have to click through to several results before finding it (assuming I find it at all). In that case, clicking through is not an endorsement; clicking through and then not clicking anywhere else might be, but it might mean I've given up, or it might mean I opened several results at once and found the solution in any one of them.<p>It might be more accurate in other search domains though.",1216193409

People sometimes resist each others ideas. My friend took to piano lessons because his brother hated it. Sibling rivalry factors ever so little especially at the early stages of growth, and it tips everything later on.",1216193228

(Some of his more technical books are out of print and hard to find. Amazon tried for about 6 weeks to find his book with Idit Harel for me, but came up empty.) I didn't know that he was in the middle of a new one when the accident occurred. The possibility that his new, unfinished book is trapped inside his head, incommunicable to the rest of us, is a sad irony.",1216192783
247407,comment,247367,247367,0,0,gaius,,,"I would argue that concurrent programming <i>is</i> something new. If you have 2 processors, then the worst thing that can happen is you get 50% of the machine's power per application - and if you have other processes running, they can use the other processor. In practice, on a dual-processor machine, you can completely ignore concurrency and often still get excellent performance for the majority of users, just by letting the OS worry about it for you. Particularly in the case where there is one long-running task in the background and one interactive task in the foreground, the user will get the best experience possible with no extra effort on the programmer.<p>The difference now is that with 32-cores (on the Sun T2000 for example) or more, unless you have a very easily partitioned workload (e.g. serving simple web pages), if you don't think about concurrency up front, your app will suck. With 32 cores, naive approaches to locking will rapidly drag performance into the mud. Working on massively multicore kit <i>if you need a single task to dominate the system</i> is a hard problem. Things are about to get interesting...",1216192772

Magic quotes is a side issue: his expected output has no quotes in it in the first place! ""Where are his random quotes coming from?"" was his question, not ""Where are these random slashes coming from?"" - he answered that question by himself.<p>But yea, $_COOKIE is the way to go.",1216192317

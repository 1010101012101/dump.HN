The DataReader and other data access classes already provide this.<p>- memory requirements ... small doesn't mean more optimized for use with ASP.NET. Database caching with MSSQL on a Windows box is much better than with MySQL on the same Windows box.<p>- read performance ... this I can accept. MySQL may perform better for simple read-only data access.<p>- management ... agreed. MSSQL lacks the ease of wa eb-based database management tool, as compared to MySQL.<p>- backup/restore/moving data ... agreed. But for slightly broader migrations, DTS and Replication are the answer.<p>- MySQL is a full version ... any web host providing MySQL database or MSSQL database, will provide you with a standard version<p>- widespread ... For .NET apps, among the .NET community, MSSQL is any day more popular that MySQL.<p>- fulltext engine ... I've worked with full text indexing engines, and let me tell you that the MySQL fulltext engine is as bad as the MSSQL fulltext service. For fulltext indexing, its always a better idea to use an external engine like Lucene or Sphinx<p>- multi OS support - unless you are developing/deploying ASP.NET apps on Linux using Mono, I wouldn't bother about it much<p>Bottomline, (unfortunately) no other database server provides better performance for small-to-medium scale ASP.NET apps than MSSQL. For larger apps, Oracle can surely scale up. Just my .2c, from years of experience with ""both"" LAMP and .NET/MSSQL. Hope it helps!",1206518378

Besides I don't think it's true.<p>The winners in the startup game are not the ones that can code, but the ones that overcome problems and persist. And are willing to learn new things in order to succeed.<p>A guy that posts here, intending to learn how to program definitely shows some potential for persistence and learning. I think he will have better chances than most.",1206518318

146667,comment,146019,146520,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"True.  Asking any amount is probably enough to weed out the folks who think hackers are inter-changeable and completely devoid of business ideas or acumen.  Of course, you can also just say, ""No thanks, I'm working on my own idea for the time being.  Best of luck to you, though.""  That's what I do.",1206518006

- mixmax: I have already bought some books to teach myself, but am finding it hard to concentrate! It has been a while since I have had to do any technical learning.
- uruzseven: To a certain extent, everyone is doing it for the money.

For the latter to work you need to be a geek with talent and tenacity.

146649,comment,146019,146260,0,0,lacker,,,"Vote weighting is possible, but maybe it's too extreme yet blunt for the problem at hand. Vote weighting would affect all articles, but really there's a specific problem of popular-but-trashy articles that you want to target.<p>For example, you could add a penalty for negative-rated comments. A trashy article is more likely to cause the sort of argument that gets comments downrated.<p>Or you could try to classify the comment contents and organization to get a sense of how ""argumentative"" vs ""quality"" they are. Bayesian if you want. You could use article contents, too, if you had a scraper.<p>Either way the ranking algorithm will have to get more complicated as time goes on. Logically you should have more information with more users, so the quality of articles should actually get better. The problem with vote weighting is that by downweighting votes you are discarding this extra information rather than using it more cleverly.",1206516218

You just have to adjust the height so that your elbows aren't clonking on the armrests while you work at a desk.<p>The Eames put a lot of thought into ergonomics and quality, so their stuff is better than your standard OfficeMax special.

So they will still have desktop presence and will probably converge to TweetDeck being their one official desktop app. I realise it's overly complex for many users, but it seems they've made this decision and will probably work to support a more minimal experience to fit the needs of people coming from the deprecated client.<p>BTW after a long period of lagging behind the old Air client, the new TweetDeck is actually working great imo.",1347242343

If you think about the idea for 20 seconds or so, what good is that? You may be wasting 20 seconds trying to rectify an idea you can't logically determine to be good.<p>A better process is a continuous one: you'll get an excellent stream of actual <i>data</i> and not just made up answers to ""What is your best non-computer hack?"" The YC partners could start out the morning looking at their Twitter-like feed of <i>what have potential startup teams done today?</i> At some point a partner would say, ""We have to pull these guys into our next batch.""<p>Incidentally, this would be better for startup teams looking to break the threshold of project to startup. By updating this proposed feed, the startup feels obligated to not only continue to put out data, but <i>good data</i>. Eventually the team would realize they can't cut it or they will keep mutating teams or changing ideas until one has great prospects.<p>EDIT: I'll buy someone a smile and a coke if the above hypothesis is implemented and tested. The following is exactly why: <i>Instagram is the one we'd most likely have missed. It all depends when we'd talked to them. They were a kind of overnight success in traffic.

The problem is that it's not really true, by which I mean there are not very many examples of it begin true, and there is an excellent reason to believe that it may never be true.  Which is: you need to find a market big enough to support ""lifestyle income"" (or your million dollars a year) but not big enough that a startup or growth technology company that is really good at doing things at scale isn't just going to eat it, and kill you in the process.<p>One of the reasons Jason Fried needs to yell so loudly about 37 Signals being the model for lots of other companies is because it's really not -- it's really rare to find a lifestyle technology business.",1347241990

4497883,comment,4497764,4497764,9,0,chime,,,"The web is still the place but I think desktop web browsers could help out a bit here to fill in the gap between full-page websites and native clients. I loved Mozilla Prism before it was discontinued. My best alternative is using Chrome in app-mode ""C:\..\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"" --app=""url://my-todos"" but it is still not enough. Chrome now has Growl-style messages that web-apps can use to notify the desktop. Trello uses that wonderfully. IE lets websites add options to the tray context menu. iOS Safari has an 'Add to Home Screen' option that makes web-pages behave more like full-screen apps and provides caching.<p>All of these things are disparate and desperate attempts by browsers to be more useful and desktop-like without any standards or forethought. I would love if the major browsers could agree on some tags/JS to enable (with permission from the user) better integration with the desktop. From taskbar/tray-icon and windows position/size to run-at-startup and multi-monitor support.<p>This way Twitter can just use a slightly different CSS file and a few meta tags to pretty much replace their native app. Browsers are now fast enough for most everything you need a desktop app for but the 'app' experience is lacking. Chrome's apps are not quite cutting it. Web-apps need to be able to break out of the browser without having to use window.open().",1347241801

4497863,comment,4491766,4497296,3,0,001sky,,,"I think its worth backing up a bit. ""What puzzles me is this purism."" ""Not all viewers are equally naive."" ""the original intent of the artist"" ""Where is the original artwork"" ""What I really want to know, is a suggest for fixing this alleged problem"" ""There is no way for us to experience these images in the original"" ""What you're reacting to is a modern photograph.""<p>Nobody thinks like this anymore.  These were debates from a long time ago. This is all strawman. These questions don't need to be answered. Digital post processing is the norm. It does not make an image worth anything.  It does not ruin it. It is just a fact or not (and in these cases, we know its true).<p>Second, why does this even matter? Well, for (1), it opens up an entirely new realm of colours.  Second (2), it allows for an entirely new realm of image-data-translations. So, we can assign point X a unique color, and then translate point X and all its neigbours to unique colors, without ruining the ""image"" information in the process.  (3) It enables an entirely new rage of output colours, so what we see is and relate too is more/less similar based on 1x2x3.  This is independent of the quality of the input image, but is magnified when these inputs are high-quality (because more translation can occurr with better tonality, et). Here is the intuition: Photoshop workin space vs Monitor output space.<p><a href=""http://www.luminous-landscape.com/Images32/17.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.luminous-landscape.com/Images32/17.jpg</a><p>Massive difference. Of course none of this has to do with what the image originally took in, this is just what we can do with it after we have it. We can do alot.<p>So, takeaway #1 is the actual color pallette of digital is unique. The acual image may be a tiny subset, and it may be designed such that it maps to an even tinier subset that is shared with C-print or whatever else you choose.  <i>But although I may end up in a <tiny> output space not blowing through the <working> space during my translations is critical</i>. If I am workin in <tiny> space I am very constrained on translations. Ina <large> space, I can do lots of translations and then jam the output into <tiny> space at the end, wit a <i>lot</i> less damage.<p>The next question is: style and image composition.  Is that unique to digital, and if so how? Why does it matter? Is it visible. etc.  This is actually alot more important than the color range. The color range, we can (if we want to) keep ""normal looking"" pretty easily.  But we need powerful tools to keep it normal looking, if we want to also have stong image tonal controls.  Each time we dial up an RGB curve, it gives us more <i>color</i> in addition to more contrast. In chemistry, the paper controls the contrast level (for the most part).  But the paper is the whole image, so a strong contrast and a punch color go together. the whole image has this ""look"". Kodachrome, Vevia etc for example is typical.  But in digital, I can have a stong contrast and a muted color, because I can turn down the color for each turn up of contrast.  So, even on a cloudy day, I can have stong contrast in the midtones, with no black shadows. I can add strong contrast to the light sky, without blown out highlights.  I can have stong overal contrast from forground to background. I can have massive tonal seperations between a green grass and a grey river. etc.<p>This look is very ""contemporary"". To sum, its strong local contrast with muted to natural color.  There are unnatural amounts of information present in all kinds of atypical relationships. Visual cues of depth and relative location do not act like normal. etc. Its more ""interesting"" to look at, because there is actually more information in the image.<p>What does this say about image quality? Nothing.  This is true for good images and bad images.  You can generate some of these effects on instagram.  Its just more stuff to look at that is precisely tailored to the way your brain processes the images (ie, midtone=yes, shadows=no, etc).  There are a whole host of subtle mind tricks, if you want to go there.  Point of fact is ansel adams is using these techniques in many of his prints, just not in color.  Its just that with PS this is all easier, faster, and far more widespread the understanding.<p>So, is some of this present in the images? Yes, it seems it is.  These images are also interesting in their own right, this is not a critique.  But for the many folks who are wondering ""how it is possible"" they are so lifelike and HD and cinematic and etc.  This is <i>in part</i> the reason.  In his day, they would have been nice BW prints.

The bottom-right (disagreeable and high-yielding) is where that magical alpha lives while the top-right (agreeable and high-yielding) is not sustainable in an even remotely efficient market - it quickly devolves and when overcrowded becomes a bubble (many people thinking it's disagreeable makes it agreeably disagreeable).<p>That we can accept and reject trades (or ideas) based on their agreeability, or dispersion of opinions, is not often considered as a metric.

Considering YC as a single entity, the optimal funding strategy must take into account both the power law on returns and the prestige of the program. If YC loses its place as the most prominent and well-respected startup incubator, the Dropboxes and Airbnbs of the future will either forgo the application or suffer from lack of investor interest. If YC limits itself to only those companies that have an extremely high chance of getting funded, the outliers will never find a way in.<p>Let's say that p_accept is the probability that YC accepts the founders of the next Dropbox. YC itself cannot optimize for p_accept because of the factors mentioned above: instead, it has to optimize for p_apply * p_accept * p_fund, the product of the chances that those golden founders will apply to the program, be accepted, and find the funding they need to grow and thrive.<p>With the hypothetical YC / YC Black Swan split, the original YC can optimize for p_apply * p_fund, and YC Black Swan can optimize for p_accept. Not only that, but since all Black Swan candidates would have started as applicants to YC, Black Swan's p_apply would equal that of the original YC.

It is worth noting however, that he suggests in that paper that RDBMS and ORDBMS engines operate in different markets.<p><i>There's an important tradeoff being discussed here, which is, ""can we get directly the data we want from the query"", versus, ""do we need to load all the data into our app first and filter it there"".

Paul, where do you get such stuff?  You have one of the best backgrounds of anyone in Silicon Valley entrepreneurship, and yet you still fall for that nonsense that fills the trash and the offices on Sand Hill Road.<p>What you mean by ""a good idea"" is just a good 'business idea', e.g., a very short, nearly superficial, description of the business to, say, an early customer.  But, Paul, that's nearly irrelevant.<p>Want a good business idea?  Make a billion dollars quickly?  A sure fire winner?  Okay, this is your lucky day.  May I have the envelope, please (drum roll).  Yes, here it is:  One pill to take once that provides a safe and effective cure for any cancer.

Think of a big, unmet need, something a billion people will pay a little for or thousands of people will pay a lot for.  E.g., the one pill cure for any cancer.  That is, think of an important, unsolved problem.<p>Step 2. Find a way to meet this need.  E.g., for the cancer pill, have to do some quite good biomedical research.  Uh, did I say that it was all easy?  I don't remember saying it was all easy.  If Step 2 is too difficult, then return to Step 1 (we're writing this in the form of an 'algorithm' since ALL TRUE hackers just LOVE algorithms).  Else proceed to Step 3.<p>Step 3. Sell the solution to the customers and take the money to the bank.<p>There it is, in just three steps.  Of course, likely the bigger the unmet need from Step 1, the more difficult will be the research in Step 2. Whatever, the key to the 'algorithm' is the research in Step 2.<p>Did I mention 'research'?  Gee, does anyone on Sand Hill Road consider research?  Well, Paul, you and Y Combinator have high qualifications in evaluating research, but a cursory look at several of the best known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, Boston, Winter Street, and NYC show little to no ability or willingness to evaluate research.  Uh, to evaluate research, as usual, we want at least a relevant Ph.D., a tenure track faculty position in a research university, and some relevant peer-reviewed publications of original research.<p>So, research is being ignored!  Opportunity knocks!<p>Now, should we have any faith in the promise of research to get solutions to practical problems, or is all of research just ivory tower intellectual self-abuse that has yet to be proven totally useless forever?<p>Let's see:  It turns out that there is in all of the world in all of history exactly one, unchallenged, unique grand champion of doing research to get powerful solutions to important practical problems.  And the track record is much better and much longer than that of Silicon Valley.<p>Without further ceremony, here's the envelope.  Yes, the answer is, the US DoD.  They got going about 70 years ago and did little projects like ""the bomb, the hydrogen bomb"", radar, synthetic aperture radar, spread spectrum radar, encoded with shift register sequences, adaptive beam forming passive sonar, inertial navigation, GPS, and on and on.<p>So, for the question, is it possible to do research that yields powerful solutions to important practical problems?  Sure.  Done.<p>So, should Silicon Valley fund research?  Well, perhaps not.  But, if an entrepreneur has selected a good ""unmet need"" in Step 1 and done some good research to get a powerful solution in Step 2, should Silicon Valley consider the research?<p>Hmm ...?  But, such research is rare!  Right!  Did I notice that you have already noticed that big winners are rare, 'black swans', outliers, ""few""?  Yup.<p>How many $200 billion winners does a $100 million venture fund need to give good returns to its limited partners?  Many?  Several?  A few?  How about just one?<p>Silicon Valley is shooting in the dark into a pond with nearly only small fish.  Silicon Valley needs to turn on some lights, look, pay attention to powerful research for big unmet needs, and then evaluate pulling the trigger.<p>My guess is that the real problem is the limited partners (LPs) who really prefer to look at reports from accountants.  So, the LPs tell their venture funds to do all evaluations as close to accounting as possible.  Since the usual accounting metrics are not yet available, the venture firms use surrogates, and their favorite is 'traction'.  They want their coveted 'traction' to be high and growing rapidly.  E.g., in the case of the bomb, they would have said ""You build and test one and get one ready for delivery, and we will chip in for the gas for the Enola Gay."".",1347239219

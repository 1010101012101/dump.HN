934999,comment,934142,934142,0,0,antirez,,,"Ok, a language for engineers not for people that want to be truly expressive with the code they write. This is my impression when looking at the examples, they have something odd in the way the code looks like.<p>Now from the technical point of view, there are a few interesting points like the threading approach, but in general the language does not appear to provide great new ideas, nor to be a language where consolidated ideas are put together very elegantly.<p>It seems like that for system programming the ""better C"" that one could need is different than this, while for general programming what is really missing is something like Ruby and Python but made as fast as C and with low memory usage by mean of doing the right sacrifices to the language, but still retain most of the abstraction level.<p>Go is not as powerful as C++, not as high level as Java, not as raw as C for low level stuff.

934995,comment,933919,934342,0,0,drusenko,,,"Sorry, but in the article, it mentioned a completely fraudulent complainant. While each host is definitely free to act as they please, if you pointed out that the original complaint was invalid (complainant info incorrect/could not get in touch) along with your counter-notice, we would reactivate your site immediately, as I imagine most reasonable companies would, since the original notice would be invalid.<p>In the case where the complainant was legitimate, then yes, your content would be offline for 10 days. However, the complainant would also be guilty of perjury, which would carry a sentence of 2-4 years in California. So, if you're affected, then go to court and get them locked up.<p>What is often overlooked is that without the DMCA the content host would be liable, so there would be no third party hosting on the Internet. Which pretty much means there would be no Internet as we know it today.<p>Granted, it's not a perfect system, but it's also not the worst thing out there.",1257933414

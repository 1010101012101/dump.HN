There's some crazy fantastic margin.<p>The user looks at a storage upgrade as ""I get twice as much for X"".  They don't break it out to $ per GB, and they don't start to compare to low volume wholesale (i.e. NewEgg) component prices.<p>Automobiles are very similar, especially the higher end you go.  Though even for family sedans, the ""cost"" of a V6 over a four-cylinder in a family sedan isn't several thousand dollars.  Even if you include upgrades to the transmission and the rest of the driveline, the raw cost doesn't come close.  It's tasty front-end margin, plain and simple, and I can't think of many people who complain about the cost per additional horsepower.  The cost to produce 19"" wheels over 18"" wheels on a Porsche Boxster isn't anywhere near the extra $1560 they charge you, but if you want stiffer sidewalls, it's what it's going to cost straight from Porsche.

I think they have the position to do so, but I'm certainly not interested in another closed platform, even if bits of the core software are free.<p>Gravatar is a wider identity platform, but it too just piggy backs on email. It's an avatar platform that piggy-backs on the email identity platform. And sadly, the avatar platform isn't distributed either.<p>In my opinion, BrowserID has a much better chance of being the technical and featureful identity provider. Anyone can be a BrowserID provider and provide any level of security from literally none to quadruple factor auth with PKI if they wanted.

Lest not forget that, in Latin American, revolutions have been fought because of the impact of the exploitation of the people and land for the cultivation of commodity products such as bananas (see Banana Wars in Wikipedia) and for which gangs like La Mara are a consequence.  Drugs for personal use are legal in Mexico, so the violence itself is not related to the criminalization of drugs, it's related to the profit of drugs.  And legalizing drugs only strengthens the cartels grip on that profit (see OPEC).<p>The one key aspect that I often find that is missing from the intellectual reasoning of the drug cartel violence in Mexico is that most Americans don't understand that narco culture that exists in Northern Mexico.  For over 30 or 40 years, there has developed a narco culture in Mexico where songs and movies have been influenced by the trade (see Chalino_Snchez).

The published literature that I've read is all embarrassingly weak - understandably, given the complexity of what it's trying to study and the minuscule investment in such research.<p>I haven't read the ebook you're advertising, but a book with an identical pitch, Robert Glass' <i>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</i>, is an example. The difference between his facts and fallacies is that the ""facts"" tend to have one poorly controlled, never replicated study (usually from 1978) to their name.

You said that those domain-specific programmers were ""not great at producing code,"" but I would argue (with tongue firmly in cheek) that in fact <i>they</i> were the productive ones, and you were not.<p>Let me explain. Productivity is defined as output over input. Programming input is activity--usually, time working--and output is software capability (or, more generally, business value). As architects, I'll bet that you didn't produce much that the company used. You probably produced designs, frameworks, or other tools for <i>domain programmers</i> to use. But the real software capability was produced by those domain experts you're criticizing, which means that they were the important actors and you were assistants at best. At worst, you could have been an impediment; I've seen ""core"" teams whose architecture-astronaut frameworks actually have to be <i>subverted</i> in order for the domain teams to get their work done.<p>I'm playing devil's advocate here, and I'm not entirely serious, but it's with a point: skill in coding isn't important unless it leads to tangible business results. In the short term, in my experience, business savvy outweighs coding skill.<p>(In the long term, technical debt becomes an overwhelming cost, so programmer skill <i>does</i> matter. But keeping technical debt low is more about maintainability, tests, and boringly understandable design than the kinds of things I see ""rock star programmers"" emphasize.)",1339801735

Bare with me!... <p>All non-registered domain names are currently sold for the same price, regardless of much value they have to potential buyers. By thinking of and buying say ""weddings-central.com"" for $10 and then reselling it for $10,000 he's creating valuable domain names that won't be wasted by being sold for less than they are worth.<p>He's basically a speculator. If he bets wrong he loses money, and he bets right he makes money and provides a useful service.",1179891865

If not for them, this practice would not be possible.",1179891636

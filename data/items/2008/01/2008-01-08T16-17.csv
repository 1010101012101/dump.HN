95992,comment,95405,95547,0,0,pchristensen,,,"There are no hard and fast rules - just do what makes you happy.  If having a family will make you happy, just do it!  That's what I did, I'm 27 with 2 kids (and struggling to find time for my side projects) and it works great for me.  If you want a <i>wealthy</i> family, then you're better off waiting, because not only do kids cost (primarily for the bigger house/apt in neighborhood with schools), they take time away from working longer to make more $$.  But the right answer depends on you.<p>But if the goal is to have successful startups, then live cheap, start young, and try and many times as you can endure!  A 40 year old who has already done 10 startups is probably a lot more likely to succeed than one who hasn't done any.",1199810569

95990,comment,95878,95878,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Since SEO and organic search favors older links, I started the blog for my startup before I even started coding!  I'm still very early on so I can't report any results, but if you write blog entries that are more useful than anything else, people will find them. But it takes time and LOTS of writing (see Paul Graham, Jeff Atwood, Joel Spolsky, Reg Braithwaite, etc).  Little mediocre posts get quickly lost and forgotten because they're not worth pointing out (see Steve Yegge's latest post).<p>SEO prominence comes not from what words you put in your posts but from content good enough that other people link to you.  Become prominent!  (there, that's enough armchair quarterbacking)",1199810297

They want stuff and don't care much about security.  Although I agree that if Google, Yahoo, MySpace, or one of the other humongous sites accepted it, that would spread the word much faster outside of the geek echo chamber.",1199810011
95988,comment,95903,95960,0,0,tomh,,,"Same here.  Got into computers with an IBM PCjr (ha they sucked) and wrote my first programs in BASIC and Pascal.  Took a sabbatical from computers that took a little longer than expected and got back into them around 1998.<p>Since then, I went back to school and eventually got an MSCS.  Still working on picking up new skills in parallel with my current job (which is all Java/J2EE).",1199810002

I'm getting bored of being a ER/Critical care nurse.  :)<p>So, I'm finishing a CS degree this summer, and I'll be working on startups full-time while working as an ER nurse part time. It's not a bad way to boot strap, really.",1199809122

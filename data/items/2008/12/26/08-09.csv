410064,comment,408786,409870,0,0,Tichy,,,"Allocating money (or time or work hours) is a necessary step in creating anything. I don't think the hard nosed approach to estimating value is very useful. You could say that only the actual workers producing something physical create value, but at the end of the day, all people in the chain contributed to it.<p>Consider a scenario where you have two alternatives: you could ship shit from one pile to another for 5 hours, or you could spend 5 hours brewing beer.  Suppose the worker has no idea whatsoever as to which activity is more benefitial, so the finance guy decides whether 5 hours will be spent on moving shit around, or brewing beer. Suppose the value of beer is much greater than moving shit - I think at the end of the day the finance guy will have contributed to bringing the beer into existence.<p>I know that there is this school of economics that tries to define value by the amount of (physical) work that went into it, but it really doesn't make much sense. You don't create value simply by doing something physical - it has to be useful, too. So I think the usefulness of the end result is a much better estimator of value.",1230281820

410062,comment,409948,409948,0,0,eli_s,,,"looks interesting. I like the way it promotes good coding practices and your idea of relative routes is cool.\nDon't know about including routing info in controllers though. I wasn't able to tell what the benefit of doing it this way is over having a routes config file. Seems that the routes would get hard to manage in a large app (even with the route browser tool).<p>+1 for not having to register to DL",1230281547
410061,comment,408786,409866,0,0,Tichy,,,"I really think you are simplifying things too much. Yes, 30 million farmers might be able to feed themselves. But there would be no doctors, because they would be busy working their fields. A waitress enables a doctor to exist by freeing him from cooking and shopping for food.<p>Producing a car does NOT create value if nobody wants or needs that car. It might even create negative value, because it might be costly to have it removed and brought to the junkyard.<p>That a waitress doesn't need training is rather irrelevant. What has been created is a) a place for the waitress to work (building a restaurant takes time and money) and b) her work produces doctors and other things - even cars, if the car manufacturers go to dine in the waitress' restaurant.<p>It is true that other services/industries could not exist without food production. But that does not imply that those other industries are worthless. In some cases, food production could not exist without the other industries/services, either (sick farmers can not produce food, they need doctors and cars to work their fields).",1230281405

410053,comment,409696,409957,0,0,kragen,,,"Yeah, I agree that the thread doesn't constitute very strong evidence for that conclusion, but both of us ended up concluding that after the thread.<p>Your thought experiment is very interesting.  It would indeed be very straightforward to invent a language that relied on absolute pitch; modems use such languages, after all.  It would be straightforward for humans to use languages which, in this way, would be very difficult to learn as adults.<p>So I wonder why there aren't any languages like that?  As far as I know, all tone languages use relative pitch rather than absolute pitch.  Vocal range isn't an adequate answer, since you could transpose the pitches into the octave or two that a particular speaker could cover comfortably.",1230279521

The thing is, I wouldn't buy it so much as an investment, but rather as a kind of insurance. So ideally I would never have to sell it, and pass it on to my children instead. It would still be annoying if it would lose it's value (as it probably would occasionally), but I don't know any good alternatives.",1230279127
410050,comment,409774,409838,0,0,Tichy,,,"Germany, but we don't have a German currency anymore. It is all Euro, and while I don't know enough details, I have heard that the way the Euro is constructed is not exactly bulletproof.<p>Inflation seems pretty likely to me, giving governments across the world are busy dishing out sweet deals to struggling industries. And governments get their money by printing it (if all else fails). Also Iceland comes to mind.<p>Of course I hope that nothing really bad will happen, but the truth is, I have no idea how severe the current crisis is. A lot of people are worried about hyperinflation, for example, but what are the odds? 1%? 0,001%, 10%?<p>Also, even without the crisis I think it has always been a good idea to diversify one's assets.",1230278809

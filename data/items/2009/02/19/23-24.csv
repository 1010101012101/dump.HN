Which means control of revenues, hiring decisions, investment behavior. You can own 49% of a very profitable company and never see a dime. Nor make decisions about your own salary if you keep working on the thing.<p>Any offer to purchase only 51% is also insulting, being a transparent attempt to pennypinch while getting total control. They think they can run the business to serious profitability but don't think buying 90% is a good idea?<p>From the perspective of a founder, giving up 51% of a company is exactly the same as giving up 100%. It is a sale and unless you're happy walking away and doing something else don't do it.",1235087406

488013,comment,487797,487797,0,0,misterbwong,,,"Took a quick look. Seems like this suffers from the chicken/egg social network problem. The more users there are, the better the data/app will be.  However, users won't use the app until the data/app returns better results.<p>Example:  I put in 92602 (Irvine in OC).  Only two pizza stores popped up-both chains (Little Caesars & Round Table) and both >8 mi from the middle of 92602.  As a user, this is an immediate turn off because the app isn't helping me find great pizza places. It is only showing me pizza places that I know about-ones that are far from me to boot.  I know for a fact that there is a Round Table Pizza that is much closer than the one mapped.<p>To combat this, you might want to load up some data programmatically so that you have a baseline (scraping PizzaHut.com or Dominoes.com would be a start).

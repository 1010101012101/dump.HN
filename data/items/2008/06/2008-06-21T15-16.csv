But I have seen scribd pages where they have a row of icons above the embedded flash and one of them is a download link.<p>Personally, the only problem I have with scribd is the use of Flash.  I think I would actually use the site if it presented pdfs using javascript and images, much like Google books.  You could still search the book, just as Google books does, because it searches the text on the server side and returns images of the pages with highlighted text.  I think this does add something new to PDF in that it makes it possible to share a book online without allowing easy download if there is interest in doing that.",1214063992

You end up with a savings of $30 a year<p>At 5 seconds to turn off the TV properly you are at $60/hour.  Most people would think this is a good rate for their work.<p>Maybe if I try and generalize this to something that it doesn't really apply to by using abstract principles with no math behind them I can get more up votes...",1214063682

Needless to say, filling in all those entries in your spreadsheet says absolutely nothing about whether those decisions are <i>correct</i>.<p>Look, this is a gimmick.  Not having used such a tool, I'm not going to say that it's worthless.  But I will say that I'm very suspicious of anyone who looks to gimmicks as the Salvation of Modern Programming.

Apparently one purchases a cpanel plan from them, along with web templates and related tools to be able to create a site to ""resell"" hosting solutions to customers.<p>Is this a worthwhile pursuit?

223701,comment,220733,222739,0,0,KirinDave,,,"mileszs, what's more disappointing is that they did it the wrong way from the start. I fully understand the decision to wait awhile if you've got an established project and you want to slowly move it over. But the reddit guys didn't, and it's pretty clear they did basically no git homework before proceeding with this.<p>That would be bad enough on its own, but then they handled the response really poorly. This ""we don't have time"" response was the sane cap on the mouth of a bottle of crazy agitated mailing list messages from a different maintainer saying strange things. It's pretty likely they never even considered it before someone mentioned it.",1214060491
223700,comment,223654,223693,0,0,jauco,,,"from pep 3099:<p><pre><code>    At one point lambda was slated for removal in Python 
    3000. Unfortunately no one was able to come up with a 
    better way of providing anonymous functions. And so 
    lambda is here to stay.

    But it is here to stay as-is. Adding support for 
    statements is a non-starter. It would require allowing 
    multi-line lambda expressions which would mean a  
    multi-line expression could suddenly exist. That would  
    allow for multi-line arguments to function calls, for  
    instance. That is just plain ugly.

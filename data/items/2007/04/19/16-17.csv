I had a week to learn it in and just couldn't get a hang of all the automatic things it did being a guy who likes to know exactly why some thing works. Not surprising considering RoR is not just a different language but also a different way of describing what you are building. I resorted to Perl and had better luck.",1177001520

The main differentiator between facebook and myspace is that facebook is clean and easy to use, vs. the maelstrom of crap that's tossed at you in myspace. <p>If they do allow widgets, I'd imagine they'd go the opposite route as myspace: instead of allowing all widgets and sites except the ones they block, facebook will probably only allow sites that are approved. \n",1177001133

Our site can be used to post music, lectures, pranks, cries of your first child and literally hundreds of other things. But it has its few primary uses and you have to pin them down and focus on those DEFINED audiences in the BEGINNING stages. Otherwise you end up confusing EVERYONE as you seem to have done here.<p>I'll help you get started if you're interested. This should make for a good mini guide too for folks in your position Answer the following questions for me in LESS than 20 words each:<p>1. What is the problem?\n2. Who is it a problem for?(note: everyone isn't an answer; think age groups, job profiles of people MOST likely facing the problem you describe in #1)\n3. How do you plan to solve this problem? (theoretically, not what Juwo is)\n4. How is Juwo solving this problem<p>Use these guidelines:\n- Be as specific as you can be. \n- Use as simple words as you can use. <p>\n",1177000812

14660,comment,14605,14605,0,0,jey,,,"I fully agree with what pg said about keeping everything you can in in-memory structures. You can save modifications to a sequential logfile, or some other simple on-disk structure that is easily maintained (e.g. separate file per record), and  read this structure into memory when you restart. Once that becomes infeasible, I would switch to using SQLite's BTrees [1] directly and bypassing the entire SQL layer. Using the SQL layer is just pretty pointless and a waste of resources. You're going to have a ""data access layer"" over your database anyway, so why not have it operate on a level where you have precise control over the access patterns and can tune it for your application? If you use the SQL layer, you're basically <i>losing</i> all that information by having your data access layer transform your operations into a high level data manipulation language by <i>building a string</i> (eww), then you leave the SQL layer of the database engine to parse your string back to something sensible and have it <i>guess</i> at how to optimize the query to get the best performance. Instead just tell it directly and skip the whole string construction, string parsing, and query analysis crap.<p>Notes<p>1. I'd suggest BDB, but it seems to suck. YMMV, always benchmark it yourself.",1177000613

We're all armchair observers just making our commentary the way we see it.<p>I'm not certain that the Civil Rights Act comes into play here, though. The problem there is that the government were mandating that people had to go to different schools just based on their skin color. On the other hand, magnet schools are inherently and legally discriminatory; they discriminate on talent. You're legally required to attend school, but you can qualify for attendance in a magnet school. They're not telling the girl to go back to the girl's school, or back to the black person's school, they're telling her to go back to the same school everyone else goes to, the normal school, the regular school, the legally mandated school. High school is not an alternative school, magnet high schools are. It's not discrimination to make someone go to a school everyone else goes to. Not everyone gets into a magnet high school; she did, and now she's been disqualified. Magnet high schools are not a right.",1353700719

Mainly advertising. I can imagine a human on Mars having a ""blog"" that would be fairly captivating to a lot of humans. Those humans could see advertising and the price would probably fall around American Super Bowl levels. Think about it, having 1/2 Billion humans checking up on one person on mars is actually pretty reasonable. Those same eyeballs can hear a message and that message can be sold to the highest bidder, making the whole venture a success. Similar to how past adventurers would sell their stories upon return to cities.<p>That's just one possible job. Never mind the actual work that needs to be done by humans on Mars.

In America, suicides in the age group of 15 to 24 are the <i>third</i> leading cause of death, with 4000 suicides in 2004 [1] (whereas if you compare to the general population here it is the 11th leading cause of death).<p>Of course, its difficult comparing suicide rates in different countries, and other factors may be at play, but this just goes to show that suicides are not a good metric to make this otherwise perfectly valid point (when more teenagers kill themselves here than in foxconn plants, the argument becomes more difficult that everyone is killing themselves because things are <i>so</i> terrible). Suicide itself is an incredibly complex topic that should probably not be trivialized. This is of course not to say conditions there are in any way good, they're not.

4823417,comment,4821928,4823018,5,0,sirclueless,,,"Indeed, the political resistance to welfare systems in the USA has always saddened me. It seems to me that at a certain point, a post-industrial first-world country has exactly two ways to continue its ascendance and raise the quality of life for its citizens: You can expand in an imperialist fashion (see: Britain in the 19th century, USA in the early 20th century, Germany in the late 1930's in dramatic fashion). Or you can become a welfare state (see: Germany post-WWII, Sweden, France).<p>The USA has a cultural heritage of expansionism. In the 1850's, losing everything was no biggie, you just moved to California and started digging. In the 1940's, losing everything was no biggie, you just joined the army and shipped out for the Philippines. But by the 1960's when imperialism more or less became untenable (see: the entirety of Africa), there were no more safety nets. America continued in its headstrong belief that no man needs charity, that hard work will provide opportunities for anyone who looks.<p>The rich always want to be richer. There's two things to do when a first-world country exhausts its own easily-exploitable resources: acquire more resources by force, or redistribute wealth. Otherwise the rich will exploit the only remaining source of wealth which is a country's middle-class.",1353700233

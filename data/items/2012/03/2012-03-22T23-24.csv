It's always hard to find that balance between being informal and jokingly reference overused terms like ""rockstar"", and being unnecessarily stuffy. We'll definitely take your comments to heart though as we refine the general descriptions.<p>The whole concept of being able to mix real world (trade school) courses with heavy theory is a tricky question. We have traditional theory heavy courses in the pipeline, but realistically, it is extremely difficult to bootstrap with theoretical courses. It's been tried before and typically fails quickly. Oddly enough, you can give away theoretical classes, and you can charge $10,000 a class for them, but you can't really sell enough at our $200-$400 price point to pay for the cost of developing the class. We believe you can teach both, and should teach both, but I'm well aware that we'll always have people saying you can't or shouldn't even attempt to do so.<p>Oh, one note on the textbooks for the course. Of course there is an image issue when you use Oreilly and Apress texts, but honestly, for that subject there just aren't any traditional texts that come anywhere near the level needed to teach the subject. Even those three have serious holes that Dr. Ostrowski has worked with the authors to plug in this course.

I mean, Steve Jobs was highly intelligent, and he clearly knew that Linus is a top-notch computing mind. But I feel like Steve has a much more focused idea of what he wants from Apple than that. He never ran Apple like it was Google; it never seemed to be his goal to gather an amalgamation of really intelligent people and encourage them to pursue their interests in the hopes of seeing what came out. Apple is a much more focused company than that, isn't it? I mean, Apple seems to have very high standards for who they hire - but those standards include more than just intelligence. It's a company that works toward fixed conceptual goals.<p>It just doesn't seem like Linus could ever have fit in with Apple culture, and I have a hard time believing that Steve didn't realize that. Maybe it wasn't as well-known yet how irascible Linus can be; or maybe Steve's notion of the culture of Apple hadn't really become as focused and solidified yet, since he'd only returned to Apple three years before.<p>Either way, as a die-hard Linux guy (albeit one with an iPhone and an iPad) I have to say that I cannot for the life of me imagine Linus Torvalds hacking away at a super-secret iOS subsystem or realigning the internals of the Lion OS or anything like that. I think we know now that Steve Jobs already knew by 2000 that those things were to come - so I wonder how he felt about Linus being part of that.",1332460104

Not only does it use texts focused on practical application and cover tech like PhoneGap, Jo, Sencha, jQTouch, and jQuery Mobile, but it is taught by a real-world developer with decades of university teaching experience"".<p>That's not a university course, that's a trade school course. Look at the ""textbooks"". Probably a useful one but it's not CS. I know you say ""We not only teach CS/SE theory at the highest level, but also provide the practical implementation that prepares you to excel in the workplace."" but to be honest that seems like a lie. I don't have much experience with teaching CS but I have some.<p>The idea that you could teach a practical (necessarily complex) toolkit at the same time or alongside high level CS concepts seems absurd. Students have a hard enough time getting those high level concepts to click but now they are mixing trade school toolkit training in at the same time? Those two goals conflict with each other. It's like using gcc internals for a compiler course.<p>I am so onboard with the online, just in time, at your own pace learning thing. But I have to say that the copy on this page has seriously dampened by enthusiam.<p>You're called ""Turing College"" and the only course is a trade school mobile app course covering mobile app framework libraries (at least they'll have to come back in 6 months for the new version of the course) and say things like this: ""Were teaching you to be a rock star, not just look like one on paper"".

It's hard to imagine how you'd get early adopters to get traction.<p>I think you're looking at it wrong. You shouldn't be comparing yourself to universities. Don't compare your prices, duration and accreditation with them. You should be building something completely different from the ground up. Something that is viable in today's world, not trying to bandage existing university models to today's world. Like pg said, build your own thing, if it's really good, it will eventually replace universities without you even aiming for that.<p>Personally, I think you should focus much more heavily on the accreditation side than anything else. Just try to build a certification system together with existing tech employers, something that they would sign and put a banner in your website saying ""company X approves this certificate as important for our selection process"". <i>That</i> would get early adopters interested. After you have that. Offer your classes for free, make those as widely available as possible. Charge for the certificate and one on one help with those who feel they need it to get your certificate.

Legislation commonly requires ""retention of anything related to X case"", but how do you know what's relevant and what isn't? When you are a third party the ambiguity increases. So you end up with an <i>everything and kitchen sink</i> data dump. Even with <i>everything</i> the data is commonly useless without context. You have files without access logs and logs referrencing local namespaces etc...<p>With a 25 petabyte discovery, I'm not surprised that everyone's scratching their heads on what to do next. This isn't just an MPAA/Megaupload problem. Even a smaller dataset like a 10-20TB discovery has numerous problems. Hosting/indexing/classifying/reviewing millions of documents is an open issue for the legal field. What do you do when there are multiple parties who all need to see ""everything""? If everyone does their own thing how do you reference materials in a consistent manner across the interested parties? If you all agree to host the data in a neutral place who pays for it? What if the technology of that host benefits one party at the expense of another?<p>For years the legal field has had a ""print it all out and have a team of paralegals go over it"" viewpoint. Clients don't pay for computers, but they do pay for paralegal hours. Only recently has that become untenable. Discovery sizes are growing exponentially per year. It's common to have a new discovery set come in larger that every previous set combined, and the legal industry doesn't really know what to do about it.",1332457893

Many jokes and phrases that were part of the inoffensive ""middle ground"" twenty or thirty years ago are now considered offensive. To the politically correct, this is mere progress, but to those who oppose political correctness it instead represents cultural and linguistic decline.<p>I ran into a small example of this recently when discussing the movie ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle"". Specifically, I wanted to refer to the ethnic background of Harold. I couldn't remember offhand exactly which country his ancestors came from, so I described him as ""Asian"". The problem is that, in the modern lexicon, Kumar (being of Indian extraction) is also ""Asian"". Thirty years ago I could have described Harold as ""Oriental"" without causing offense, but that changed some time in the mid- to late '80s. (I distinctly remember, some time around 1990, overhearing a high-school teacher instruct one of my Vietnamese classmates not to refer to herself as ""Oriental"". She was comfortable with the term; he was not. His side won, and we have lost some linguistic precision because of it.)<p>To cite another example, from 1555 until the 1960's the word ""Negro"" was a neutral term signifying a person of black sub-Saharan African descent, at which point it was replaced by ""black"" (or ""Black""). This lasted until 1988, when (in a domestic context) ""African-American"" became the preferred term. Meanwhile, ""colored person"" was also once a neutral phrase (as evidenced by the NAACP), but now uttering it in the workplace (or in a joke) can get you fired. In contrast, the term ""person of color"", which is almost semantically identical to ""colored person"", is not only inoffensive but is the preferred term among the PC <i>cognoscenti</i>.

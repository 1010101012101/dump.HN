8933487,comment,8932696,8932951,0,0,tgokh,,,"My university and hospital system recently rolled out Box across the whole institution. I think the major difference is that Box is willing to sign a Business Associate Agreement and ensure compliance with HIPAA standards. My understanding is that Dropbox has been unwilling to negotiate and sign BAAs, so the service can&#x27;t be used for sensitive information without huge risk. At least at our institution, we can store deidentified research data on Box, and there are options available for storing Protected Health Information as well (though it requires going through our Information Security office)",1421989198

The bigger the commercial line, the more likely it&#x27;s all about who throws the best yacht parties (reinsurance in particular suffers from this massively).<p>Crowdsourced insurance is indeed a terrible idea, though you could imagine &#x27;web of trust&#x27; insurance that almost made sense -- say my ten thousand best friends and I know that we&#x27;re all great actuarial risks, perhaps because we have some kind of information on which it&#x27;s illegal to select (that we&#x27;re all in the same gym, say). We could then try to write ourselves health insurance for cheap, because our plan would select only us gym members. You can sort of make it work, as long as you&#x27;re prepared to make the regulators hate you.<p>Which is the real problem, of course -- most people buy insurance because they have to, not because they want to. Auto insurance that wouldn&#x27;t pass muster with the police, or home insurance that wouldn&#x27;t satisfy the bank holding your mortgage, doesn&#x27;t solve the problem.<p>Do good problems exist? Sure. A web-based Managing General Agency, for instance, could do very well for itself, but the expressed ideas in this section are pretty terrible.",1421989131

This is a political problem, first and foremost.<p>2. How much it costs depends on what the school does with its network. If it offers cloud storage as part of the tuition (to offset the cost of not having much storage on the little mice) and gives the more computationally-intensive majors access to a compute cluster for the price of tuition (same reason), it could be a nice little setup.<p>Students would always have most of their files on them all the time, the school could buy more keyboard-laptop pairs than it buys actual computers to reduce the pressure on the public labs, and the mice could be fairly cheap if bought in bulk and resold.

Then I can artificially inflate the gold prices on my exchange, using fictitious money (like the willy bot did), leading customers to come to me to trade their gold for high prices, and therefore impacting the worldwide market price of gold... at least a tiny little bit for a tiny little while... until customers find out that they can&#x27;t withdraw their fictitious money from my exchange, so my sham and its impact ends right there. This is what happened to MtGox in February 2014.<p>The bigger the market you are attacking is, the less time it takes for the sham to be discovered, because the tiny percentage of people who try to benefit from the fictitious high prices quickly overwhelm your ability to fake solvency. A huge market like gold would pretty much suffer no effect due to its size. And as the Bitcoin market continues to grow, the hypothetical impact of such a sham should diminish over time.",1421988524

I&#x27;ll explain why.)<p>When exchange A&#x27;s price is different from exchange B&#x27;s, that represents an opportunity.  As the difference grows, that opportunity becomes more lucrative.  That&#x27;s why, at any given time, all exchanges are at roughly the same price.<p>But that means if one exchange is playing by some bad rules, or is acting in a shady way, like the behavior described in <a href=""https://willyreport.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://willyreport.wordpress.com/</a>, then that directly affects every other exchange.<p>So unless all exchanges are playing by the same rules, having a single &quot;safe&quot; exchange won&#x27;t save you.

So, there are not &#x27;most important&#x27; elements, all are equally required for the system to work (yes, you could use a computer w/out a mouse or a keyboard but that is a different system, like you could use a car without gas in the middle of the road as a very uncomfortable motel room).<p>Furthermore, the mobility argument breaks in two links:<p>- To move your computer system (set) you&#x27;d need to move the kb and screen as well. How would I use the MouseBox on a plane flight? Laying on my couch? On the park? Laptop, tablet, phablet and smartphone are portable computer systems.<p>- Nowadays mobility of the hardware elements of a computer system are secondary, what needs to move is data (OS, apps and files). Cloud emerges then. I can read/write email from anywhere on a different device. Paradoxically the software elements of the system are not moving per se, they live on a server, but being ubiquitous accessible they are &quot;like&quot; moving. This reminds me of that night ride in that car (with gas this time) and a full moon following me everywhere.<p>Your product is somewhat cool but IMHO it would have been much better to do the kb-trackpad-box, like this one but with a CPU: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Multi-Touch-Touchpad/dp/B005DKZTMG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1421987140&sr=8-3&keywords=wireless+keyboard+and+mouse+combo;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Keyboard-Multi-Touch...</a> and still it would under-perform other existing portable computing devices already mentioned b/c those come with a screen.",1421987573

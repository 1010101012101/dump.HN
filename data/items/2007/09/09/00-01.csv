52348,comment,52251,52251,0,0,mynameishere,,,"People have given millions of dollars to Ron Paul. That's an ungame-able vote. If Paul is getting 1-2 percent of real support among voters, then there should be no shortage of Guiliani and McCain and Romney fans to quickly downmod any stories they don't like.<p>But evidently, Paul is the only Republican candidate with fans on reddit. If there's a ""flaw"" that's the only one.<p>By the way, LBJ was much, much worse than Bush.",1189298627

52346,comment,52251,52340,0,0,Alex3917,,,"That makes sense. Similar to that, a while back I posted a theory about why Reddit discourages insightful content:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7566"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7566</a><p>It seems like the ideal social site would use a del.icio.us-like mechanism for promoting resources and reference type stuff, a techmeme-like system for promoting insightful and intellectually interesting stuff (based partly on the amount of discussion), and a Reddit-like system for promoting Lightweight Digital Refreshment. Right now each social site uses one algorithm for all types of content, which is why they're all broken.\n",1189298097

52342,comment,52251,52311,0,0,zach,,,"I agree, and this also shows that you don't need any kind of hierarchy, status or conspiracy for a user-driven media outlet to gain a feeling that some kind of cabal is running things.<p>I mean, Reddit makes contribution (including filtering) about as easy as possible, there is no user class with special status, and not a whole lot of editorial discussion, and yet still people can complain that the output is disproportionately controlled by a minority with particular interests.<p>I think this is more of an enduring pattern showing up again than a particular weakness in Reddit.",1189297666
52341,comment,52251,52322,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"I don't think that is the case. Your essays are fundamentally different than the Ron Paul news stories. They have a limited shelf life. I don't really feel a need to bookmark the latest Fox News injustice towards Ron Paul or clips of his last debate or news that the s&p dropped 7% or news that Sarkozy won. I want to read about it; I think it is important; but I don't need to read about it 3 years from now. <p>But Ron Paul does end up on Digg and Technorati. Ron Paul posters are all over my campus. There are packed rallies and meet ups. I think that Ron Paul is important news right now. A lot of young, technically proficient people seem to agree. (These are a lot of the same people who like you by the way.) <p>It would make good business sense to implement some sort of clustering method. So, a great number of minority groups could happily use the site and view the ads.<p>But, if you were the editor of reddit, I would hope you would not censor Ron Paul's stories. The community would if it wanted to; if you search for Ron Paul on reddit, you will find that the vast majority of his stories have 0 points. This invisible hand of the reddit market would surely please Ron Paul. <p>edit: My god does that last sentience sound dirty...",1189297275
52340,comment,52251,52327,0,0,pg,,,"I've thought a lot about this.  The answer is that there are several senses of better.  The stuff on del.icio.us/popular is ""better"" in the sense that people only bookmark stuff that means a lot to them.  But lightweight stuff [PIC] is easier to click on and thus ""better"" in the sense of generating more page views.",1189297088

The problem I'm talking about is simply a structural one: because such a small proportion of visitors on social news sites vote, 100 of his vocal supporters can dictate the stories for a site with 100,000 users.<p><i>Man</i> is politics a tar baby.  I wish I'd never made that comment on reddit.  Nothing personal (I mean this more about the reddit commenters than you), but it's a topic that brings out the dumbest in everyone.",1189296317

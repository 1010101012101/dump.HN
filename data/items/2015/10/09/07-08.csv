The basis of their approach is that it doesn&#x27;t encompass any expert design. It&#x27;s an end-to-end deep learning approach. From the article:<p>> Our system is different than that system in that it’s more what we call end-to-end. Rather than having a lot of human-engineered components that have been developed over decades of speech research — by looking at the system and saying what features are important or which phonemes the model should predict — we just have some input data, which is an audio .WAV file on which we do very little pre-processing. And then we have a big, deep neural network that outputs directly to characters. We give it enough data that it’s able to learn what’s relevant from the input to correctly transcribe the output, with as little human intervention as possible.<p>> One thing that’s pleasantly surprising to us is that we had to do very little changing to it — other than scaling it and giving it the right data — to make this system we showed in December that worked really well on English work remarkably well in Chinese, as well.<p>So they&#x27;ve quickly trained their Deep Speech engine [1] to process Mandarin after first training it to transcribe English, <i>without</i> injecting specific language expertise into the engine.<p>Finally, I strongly doubt the OCR and speech recognition teams are the same. I don&#x27;t know about the OCR team but their speech recognition team is based in California [2] and includes Andrew Ng and Awni Hannun from Stanford University.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://usa.baidu.com/deep-speech-lessons-from-deep-learning/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usa.baidu.com/deep-speech-lessons-from-deep-learning/</a>",1444377295

Who wouldn&#x27;t forget that a Try/Catch block in a lazy val/var would be useless (because it would only throw the exception when evaluating the val/var) ?<p>And I agree, pure FP has a lot of benefits, the problem is that is too hard to create a real system in a pure FP approach. So we often make compromises to get things done. I use Scala everyday (and used to develop in Java) and I&#x27;m aware of that.

Those are the two problems that nobody seems to be solving yet.<p>Basically, high-voltage electricity is distributed with networks that are dumb and old. The generation and usage is very carefully balanced with heavy users and large producers, because the network does not have storage capacity. It also has very little tolerance for power imbalance, the frequency cutoffs in the old equipment running most of the network are rather severe (in high-voltage networks, frequency increases with more power being fed into the system).<p>There are already extremely severe network problems in Germany for example where quite a bit of power comes from solar and wind. (I worked as an embedded sw engineer doing software that controlled solar inverters for a while)<p>The problem with upgrading distribution network is of course the MASSIVE amounts capex needed to replace it.<p>The other problem is industrial consumers - an aluminium smelter requires a certain amount of power coming in 24/7 or the ovens will freeze and if they do, restart is basically impossible. There are many other factories with similar problems. Given the trend towards just-in-time production and shipping, the chain of events that leads to massive disruption in the global trade can start from a fairly small shutdown with large snowball effects.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to put down green power generation, just saying that getting the price down to reasonable level is just one part of the puzzle.",1444376133

The technical side of supporting Linux in this environment can be very difficult.<p>There are, as you note, issues with the locations or presence of certain files, directories, and scripts. That&#x27;s one part of the problem, but probably the easier one to solve (we had a whole big function that would try to detect how to open a URL by checking for xdg-open and older variants, checking configuration for KDE/GNOME/etc., and then falling back on detected browsers). This also has to be done for opening arbitrary files using their assigned program.<p>What&#x27;s more complicated are library dependencies. Depending on system installs on GTK+ isn&#x27;t always enough. You may need features not available on that install, due to version issues. You may have to work around versions of system libraries that have a bug present on one particular distro due to a custom patch.<p>Themes and icon sets are a problem if you hit any version compatibility problems. Your UI can appear broken if you reference icons that aren&#x27;t registered on that system (generally an issue on older installs). This actually gets complicated quick in some cases.<p>So as an ISV, you have a couple of options for how you approach all this. You can limit the distros and versions you support, putting out builds for each. This is a perfectly fine strategy if you can get away with it, but not everyone&#x27;s going to be able to use your program in that case.<p>Another option, which is what we did, was to basically ship everything we needed along with the program. Libraries (glibc, gtk, x11, everything we were forced to ship for compatibility), icon sets, themes, etc. You then try to dynamically figure out which modules you can load from the system, and which you need to load from shipped modules. You also need to handle setting up paths for anything like icon sets and fallback themes you may need, and deal with the compatibility issues that can occur from that (older versions of the XDG icon theme spec didn&#x27;t have a properly-functioning fallback system when specifying multiple icon theme directories).<p>If you ever need to do anything more specialized (support for hardware devices, anything using D-BUS on older installs, more specialized window management abilities), you run into a whole new set of issues.<p>These days I focus almost entirely on web-based software, so that sort of wide range of compatibility problems are entirely behind me.

It doesn&#x27;t seem to make any sense to have the same words mean different things if you can just make a different word. After all, what&#x27;s really the difference between bat and bet and bit and bot and but? It&#x27;s clearly all the same word!<p>Sarcasm aside though, a whole lot of languages are tonal. Most languages spoken in Asia and many African ones are. And you use tone too: what&#x27;s the difference between &quot;You there.&quot; and &quot;You there?&quot; and &quot;You there!&quot;. It just serves a different purpose in English than it does in Chinese so it seems less mysterious to an English speaker.<p>The only tonal language I can really speak about is Mandarin (although I encourage you to read about other systems). The way the tones work in Mandarin isn&#x27;t as complicated as it sounds. The classic example is this[1]:<p>1. mā (妈, mother). This sounds like a somewhat high-pitched, steady tone<p>2. má (麻, hemp). This is called a rising tone, and it sounds sort of like the end of a question in English<p>3. mǎ (马, horse). This tone falls and then rises (sort of like a #4 then a #2). Imagine a whiny child saying &quot;mooooom!&quot; to get their mom&#x27;s attention<p>4. mà (骂, scold). This tone falls quickly, it sounds like in the movies when someone shouts &quot;Hey!&quot; at a robber that&#x27;s getting away<p>5. ma (吗, an interrogative particle). This is a neutral tone, its sound depends mostly on the syllable before it but in isolation it either falls slightly or sounds like an English &quot;toneless&quot; syllable.<p>Mandarin only has those 5 tones, it&#x27;s not like &quot;ma&quot; can sound fifteen different ways. They aren&#x27;t differentiated by the pitch itself exactly, it&#x27;s whether the pitch is rising or falling.<p>A Chinese speaker might describe the difference between má and mà the same way you&#x27;d describe the difference between &quot;bet&quot; and &quot;bit&quot; to a speaker of a language that doesn&#x27;t differentiate those vowels. Sort of like rhyming, but not quite. As an easier example, Spanish doesn&#x27;t really have a contrastive /ɪ/ as in &quot;bit&quot;, so a Spanish speaker might have the same trouble differentiating or producing it without some practise that you might have doing the same to má or mǎ.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)#Mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)#Mechanics</a>",1444375037

One can hydrolyze the water during low loads and store the resulting hydrogen (hydrolysis equipment and stationary storage is relatively simple and cheap). A generator with gas turbine to burn the hydrogen  would cost on the scale like $400/kw - a small addition to the $2K/kw capital cost for solar panels install. The week of reserve storage - 200kwh to be generated - with even low 40% efficiency of turbine generation - would require storing 250m3 of hydrogen to provide a week reserve per 1kw of basic capacity. Lets say that storage is generous $1/m3.<p>As result, under $3K/kw we&#x27;d have a week of reserve and the ability to short-term double power during peaks using the gas turbines. And using the same loan calculations it is $0.075/kwh.",1444374455

Way before Linux was even a thing, every Unix used /usr/bin/env - and that was the point of it being used to find an interpreter. Red Hat (where I worked at the time, man years ago) realised the mistake, but alas didn&#x27;t want to break compatibility.<p>&#x27;lsb-release&#x27; was always hilarious: the one thing about Linux that is almost standard is that the LSB tools are never present.",1444374297

They can even tell the computer of the car how to recognise when the car is being driven according to a specific test-cycle and adjust the combustion accordingly. It was this kind of software that six truck manufacturers, including two European firms (Volvo and Renault), recently used in the United States to defeat the EPA&#x27;s pollution control. As a result emissions of nitrogen oxides from highway driving increased by 300 per cent. &quot; extract from: &#x27;Cycle Beating and the EU test cycle for cars&#x27; - Per Kageson - European Federation for Transport and the Environment - November 1998",1444374270

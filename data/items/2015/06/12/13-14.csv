What a bout of inflation allows is resetting everyone&#x27;s salaries, pensions, etc to a lower level without inducing extra unemployment which requires an even larger correction.<p>There is always the danger that Greece will say &quot;to Hell with it,&quot; print money to fund their expenditures, and get hyperinflation.

I&#x27;ve been doing it for about 15 years and I keep seeing the same consultants over and over again.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal.  Most manufacturing companies (think Big Pharma, Petrochemical, Chemical, Widget manufacturing, anything really) measure quality.  Those quality measurements are probably done in a laboratory.  Every laboratory generates data.  All that data needs to be managed well so that the laboratory can maintain its accredidation.<p>Basically, LIMS systems manage samples and lab result data.  In addition, they probably integrate with Instruments and instrument software to automate some of that data entry.<p>Other industries besides manufacturing are Govt (waste and wastewater treatment labs), Third-party labs (labs that do testing for other companies), Healthcare (clinical labs), Forensic Labs, and more.<p>Bottom line, there are tons of laboratories and they all need to manage their data.<p>The players in this space are downright stuck in the last decade.

9705849,comment,9705098,9705485,0,0,supermatt,,,"> This is a conceptual error. There is no such thing as &quot;the application as a whole&quot;. There is only the currently-deployed set of services, and their versions.<p>Im using Martin Fowlers description (whom I admire greatly):\n&quot;In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services&quot; <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html</a><p>My problem is knowing which microservice dependencies the application has.<p>> You should have a build, test, and deploy pipeline (i.e. continuous deployment) which is triggered on any commit to master of any service. The &quot;test&quot; part should include system/integration tests for all services, deployed into a staging environment. If all tests pass, the service that triggered the commit can rolled out to production. Ideally that rollout should happen automatically, should be phased-in, and should be aborted and rolled back if production monitoring detects any problems.<p>We have this, and it is what builds the manifest (as a git repo containing the submodules).<p>The problems occur when you have multiple commits to different services. If a build is marked &quot;red&quot; because it fails a &quot;future integration&quot; then it just means that it is failing at that point in time. It may, following a commit of a dependency, become valid. However, it would need to have its build manually retriggered in order to be classified as such.<p>This becomes cumbersome when you have a not insignificant number of services being commit to on a regular basis.",1434117347

The question I wonder is more, &quot;Does the degree prepare us for either of these areas?&quot;<p>In the area of programming I believe the answer is a resounding NO.  Most students coming out of a 4 year CS program aren&#x27;t ready to be programmers.  They&#x27;ve been taught a bunch of theory and fundamentals, but they haven&#x27;t spent time applying them on real problems at scale.  Within the classroom setting the fundamentals are applied to trivial problems that can fit into the constraints of a classroom setting.<p>Like many programmers, my career path (until recently), has kept me pretty far away from the math; so I don&#x27;t think I can say for sure that the same is true here, but I suspect it is.<p>I have argued for a long time that much like a doctor goes through a residency program, something similar should be required of computer science degrees.

He was also a part time scout for the Seattle Mariners and he would do all of his in class examples using either base ball or real estate.

But! Keep these in mind:<p>- Can you come up with a better process that scales with the number of interviewers in your company, but also maintains reasonable consistency and keeps reasonable costs? Maybe you think you can, but keep in mind that the tech giants have data-crunched their interview stats over and over and this process is what they stuck with. (Of course, with scale there&#x27;s also the problem you occasionally have arrogant interviewers - but I think that problem should be decoupled from the coding/non-coding interviews problem).<p>- In places where they look for A* engineers, the point of the interview is often not to test what you know best, but how you get along with problems you have never seen before.

While your approach of collecting your microservices as a collection of submodules is novel, that also defeats the purpose of microservices -- you should be able to maintain and deploy them independently without having to be concerned with interoperability.<p>While it&#x27;s possible to alleviate some of your pains with versioned APIs to track changes to your data models, you also conflict with data you already have stored in schemaless DBs when those models update.<p>In a Node or frontend JS stack, I solve that problem with Vers [1]. In any other stack, the idea is fairly simple to replicate: Version your models _inside_ of your code by writing a short diff between it and the previous version every time it changes.  Any time you pull data from a DB or accept it via an API, just slip in a call to update it to the latest version. Now your microservice only has to be concerned with the most up-to-date version of this data, and your API endpoints can use the same methods to downgrade any results back to what version that endpoint is using.  And frankly that makes versioning your APIs far simpler, as now you move the versioning to the model layer (where all data manipulation really should be) and only need to version the actual API when you change how external services need to interact with it.<p>And now your other microservices can update to the new schema at their leisure.

This couples them in a way that a small API change can be breaking. Instead use a messaging solution so that each service is passing messages and grabbing messages off a queue to do work.  This is the easiest way to prevent coupling. It also allows you to version messages if need be and you can deploy a new service to consume those messages. We use JSON, so we can add to a message with no ill effect, and we are careful about removing any required attributes. So we haven&#x27;t had a need to version messages, but the ability is there if we find it is needed at some point.<p>Adding messaging does increase complexity in some ways, but once you pass having a handful of services this is the easiest way to manage it.<p>As a side note. In our solution we have an API that the website and soon to come mobile app tie to. That API interfaces directly with some data schemas but in many places it simply adds messages to a queue for processing.",1434116051

Most of the AAA games I&#x27;ve tried in VR have not had text that was even remotely readable, and it was all because it was rendered too small.<p>The Gear VR has a fairly decent GPU. The move to mobile was more about discarding legacy fixed-function pipeline techniques and more directly optimizing for shaders. The main factor limiting texture-fill is GPU RAM. But most devices have more than enough RAM to be able to render text well.<p>VR is a realism multiplier. Traditional 3D graphics techniques are realism <i>fakers</i>. You shouldn&#x27;t apply many traditional graphics techniques, because they have perspective-dependent artifacts that are subtle to impossible to notice in mono still images but glaring in stereo motion. So I think it&#x27;s folly to apply too much effort on things like displacement shaders or stereo textures. These sort of things both A) cost a lot of time, and B) look terrible in an unrestricted stereo view. There&#x27;s even new research to suggest one&#x27;s general hormonal balance can have a <i>huge</i> impact in whether or not these miscues are going to cause simulator sickness in a user. You could literally be alienating half of your potential users along gender lines.<p>In the face of that, I think it makes more sense to stick to simpler techniques that respect the Hippocratic Oath: first, do no harm. We&#x27;ve been able to write some 3D games that run at 150fps for over a decade now. But there is no 150hz display to pair it with. V-sync is probably the most important issue, followed closely by running at native resolution (so for a given GPU, a lower resolution screen might actually be better, because it will be easier to hit the full refresh rate at the native resolution) and clean, consistent antialiasing. It wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if both eyes were rendered identically, but having the dual eyes highlights any visual artifacts that appear. Match those three issues and the realism of the content doesn&#x27;t matter, it could be flat-color, Phong-shaded cubes and you&#x27;ll have a great VR experience. Miss any of them and even high-end games like Elite: Dangerous that are gorgeous on 2D will look like complete garbage.<p>VR has completely inverted the priorities of graphics programmers. Because of this, I think the primary VR innovation is going to come from indie developers, because most established companies can&#x27;t switch their focus away from their 2D-display oriented consumer base. The Call of Duty series has sold over 175 million units. Assume nearly $40 a pop, that makes over $7 billion. You&#x27;re not going to see VR getting anywhere near that for a few years still, and companies like Activision and EA aren&#x27;t going to chase after such small potatoes in anyway other than just PR.",1434115332

If something physical is changing from parents to children, then that means autism is at least partly genetic (it&#x27;s been shown before[0]) and it might be able to be measured and predicted before birth and development, which further means that it can be treated earlier, and prevented more.<p>I have a friend that was diagnosed with autism early, and through years of help with an awesome therapist it would be hard to tell that they&#x27;re autistic. That said though, many people don&#x27;t have access to that kind of help or stability, and therefore suffer significantly more throughout their life.<p>I like making these connections because if people realize that things like autism are <i>physical</i> ailments contracted at birth, and not something that fucking vaccines give you, then perhaps the stigma around them will disappear and we can bring a higher quality of life to all.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/new_autism_causing_genetic_variant_identified"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/new_autis...</a>",1434115328

But <i>every</i> image I&#x27;ve ever had to create contained far more edge cases than default cases, and half of those edge cases are things nobody thought of and therefore their system doesn&#x27;t handle it. Rather than trying to fight with one of these systems to get them to do something I could easily do with a few Bash commands, I find it easier to just script the setup in Bash to begin with.<p>Obviously that doesn&#x27;t work for Windows systems.",1434114821

Well, exactly like in Brazil.<p>I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;d have the Australian problem -- that someone else mentioned in here -- of rents going up and the basic income of people being diluted in the economy making general prices higher. It has been proposed before a basic income of between 50-75 USD per month and I believe currently there&#x27;s only a single city in the whole country where it&#x27;s effectively in use; that&#x27;s never been approved in country-level, that&#x27;s why.<p>That may seem an extremely low income but when you&#x27;re starving that&#x27;s a LOT of money, specially in the country side, and it&#x27;s enough to make a huge impact in the economy and the development of the country in the long term. I don&#x27;t think anyone who makes 20x more money than that monthly would worry about it, so no evil landlords to mess with the plan... in theory. Also, because that would apply for ANYONE who lives in the country (even foreigners), there wouldn&#x27;t be this &quot;they get it, I don&#x27;t&quot; feeling that could generate hatred between classes.

Funding for medical devices is quite, quite different than software (i.e., bad but getting better recently).  We don&#x27;t fit the model for many VCs, so that limits potential sources, and being in medical devices means that we need to deal with sophisticated investors that can run proper DD on us, further limiting potential sources.  Funding has been (and still is) a struggle!  It&#x27;s also a little bit &quot;lonely&quot;: we run into a lot of problems unique to this industry, but often we can&#x27;t talk about it in detail, and even when we can, there aren&#x27;t many people around to talk to.<p>Project management has been interesting.  There&#x27;s quite a number of consulting and industrial design groups out there, which helps to bring in expertise when needed and keep things lean overall.  A big challenge has been in setting up the supply chain: it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve done (or thought of) before, but consulting has helped out here as well.

We need to design things conservatively, unless we have a really, really good reason not to.  We also need guaranteed years of availability for parts, which additionally tends to lead to conservative designs.<p>Surprising lessons learned: cable management (i.e., in the device) is a nightmare, and packaging is anything but a simple problem to solve.

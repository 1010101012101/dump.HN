5778787,comment,5777723,5777723,1,0,oneiros,,,"I find this quite amusing. Yes, it was out of place for the kid to deface the wall. Yes, he should have thought twice before proceeding with his actions, but at the end of the day, this is nothing more than a material object.<p>People are so quick to bash on somebody, as evident in the comments on the article. This raises the question of whether the true issue is that the kid did something that was immoral, or that these commenters and those other people who are lashing out in anger in response to this are merely using this as a way to feed their ego, or possibly as a way to justify something that they've done, that caused others to consider them to be ""stupid, ""irresponsible"", etc.<p>My heart aches for each time I see a child, and often an adult, kill, a living creature. Something even so small as a fly, killed just because the fact that it is a fly and considered ""annoying"". Everyone has a right to life, a scratch in some 3.4 thousand year old limestone wall is not going to hurt anybody. In fact, three millennia into the future, people might regard that very same scratch to be of important historical value. The fact that people are focusing so much anger and hatred to this naive child, instead of focusing on something more important such as spreading peace and love, saddens me. And how ironic, that the very same people who are so against graffiti, graffiti on something themselves.<p>The reason that these artifacts exist is to tell a story, the true value in these is not the material aspect of this artifact, but the <i>informational</i> value. The information, although now slightly altered, is not destroyed. This is what is important. And I don't doubt that there is photographic evidence of the egyptian glyph in it's preexisting form archived somewhere, possibly in a library.<p>If you <i>really</i> wanted to deface it, you'd need to find a way to remove it from history. Only then will it's true purpose, historical archive of an important message, will be defeated.<p>And think about this, for everyone complaining about him defacing the artifact, wake up, you probably deface the oldest artifact in existence every day. The earth itself.",1369727909

5778781,comment,5704866,5704866,1,0,csense,,,"Document the provenance of every piece of code.  Make a list of any third-party code you use, open source or proprietary, and a copy of the licenses.<p>At the top of each source file, make a comment with the name of the author, a copyright notice, and a pointer to your license file.  If you've used version control since day 1, it can help you determine where your code comes from.<p>That should take care of copyright infringement.<p>Trademark and patent infringement might require hiring a lawyer to perform searches of relevant databases.  This is going to be time-consuming and expensive for patents, and you may well end up infringing because of the awful situation of software patents.  My best advice is to not mention patents and hope the customer doesn't bring up the issue.<p>I read somewhere that there's a ruling in the US that, unless you're a patent attorney, a court must presume that you don't know how to understand patents.  And if you read a patent and incorrectly conclude that you don't infringe, that makes you aware that you infringe, and negligent because you didn't seek the advice of a patent attorney, and you're automatically liable for triple damages.  But if you hadn't read the patent, you're only liable for single damages.<p>So it's better never to read any patents, ever, and pray you don't infringe, or if you do, that the patent holder isn't going to notice you until you're big enough to fight back.",1369727790

I didn't enjoy the bulk of the work.  I wasn't learning anything applicable outside of my employer's niche.  I was being given projects that I was completely unqualified to work on (but I was the least unqualified person, so they fell to me).<p>After one particularly brutal day that didn't see me home until well after midnight, I did some serious soul-searching.  I gave my (pretty generous) notice the next day.<p>I did the math and figured out my vacation payout + vacation time I had lost over the years due to the yearly cutoff was about three months, so I planned to take a three month vacation.  Sleep all day, learn a programming language, drive to interesting places, read books, play video games, whatever sounded interesting that particular day.  Recharge the ol' batteries.  And that's exactly what I did.<p>After my three months of R&R were up, it was time to start looking for a job.  I applied for interesting-sounding jobs that I thought I was qualified for.  Silence.  I contacted some friends and asked about opportunities, then sent CVs to the few that said, ""Yes, we have positions you should apply for!""  More silence.  I continue(d) to apply for interesting jobs, resisting the urge to just scattershot resumes at everything I'm qualified for.  (I think that's tacky, and I'm not that desperate yet.  Plus, I don't want another job I'll hate and/or burn out on.)<p>My three months turned into six months...and then nine months...and now stands at 11 months.  I haven't been able to get a single interview -- phone, e-mail, in-person, or otherwise.  My savings and expenses are such that I'm okay for another two years or so, but I will need an income of some sort eventually.<p>Maybe my skill set is crap.  Maybe my CV is crap.  Maybe it's my employment history gap.  Maybe it's karmic retribution.  I can't be certain, but my money's on the gap.<p>tl;dr: Your mileage may vary, but I'm pretty sure I Darwin'd my career by taking time off without doing anything that I could put on a CV to explain the gap in my employment history.",1369725494

In Germany, it happened to multiple of my friends that just before they had to start their service, the military decided not to ""pull"" them because they made their categories non-eligible for military service. This severly damages the fairness of the service. Had there not been the option of civil service as a replacement, that unfairness would have been even worse: the modern military just doesn't have enough resources to have a whole generation in service all the time.<p>Second, I feel as connected to my generation/nation before or after my service. I consciously did civil service[1] and liked it, though.<p>What I _liked_ about the service was that it forces you to do something non-proitable for a while.

Here's an idea. Have you considered going back to school for a Master's, if you don't already have one? That could give you more personal time to explore side projects (as well as hopefully working on something cool for your degree), handily explains 2-3 years of gap in employment history, and you come out with a degree.

Appearing in the first 3 links can be very valuable, appearing in the third page practically worthless.<p>Ranking first on Mesothelioma, a form of cancer only caused by asbestos exposure, can generate a few millions a year, as there is almost always someone to sue for the exposure (btw CPC for related search terms around 70$ ).<p>Ranking first on ""purple dragons with red horns"" will probably not generate a dime.",1207129664
152930,comment,152881,152881,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"> While ranting; what the f*ck do you need $4M for?<p>According to the article the company has 12 employees.  Assuming a fully loaded cost of $100,000 per employee (I expect most are coders).   Then $4m covers 3.3 years of salaries.   So they give themselves about 3 years of runway to actually make the site make money.<p>That's what you do with $4m.<p>> The whole iPaper thing is cute.<p>> But how do you build a working business model around it?<p>That's what $4m gives you 3 years to figure out.  Also, I think iPaper is a bit more than 'cute'.  I have a lot of different document types that I need to make public (e.g. PDFs, PPTs,Keynote, Excel, Numbers).  Since Scribd can just take these and turn them into a common format for me it makes sense for me (when I get around to it) to convert everything to iPaper so that everyone can read them.",1207129526

Target inflation for the ECB continues to be 2%.",1207129073

Changes in play are limited by the dexterity of the player (and upper bounded by the dexterity of a body), but choices and timings aren't so mechanical.<p>The exact timing (feel, even) of, say, a swung eighth requires quite a lot of resolution before it's done right. I'd love to see them, even after they get tonguing ""down"", do a double blind study in Jazz.",1207128120

152917,comment,151980,152032,0,0,derefr,,,"Do you still have humanoid ""player characters"" in your game, or is your avatar simply a [set of] ships? I've always wished for a space game where each ""ship"" is a thriving colony all on its own, with hundreds of players with their own quarters, and an intense rivalry over who will be ""captain"", ""navigator"" and so on (unless it's some sort of military ship, but there could still be a mutiny!) If you <i>are</i> the ship[s], this gets a little less poignant.<p>Also, watching sci-fi TV shows for a long time, I've come to appreciate the visual value of ""away missions""/shore-leave. It's boring staring at a starfield for hours at a time (even with cool nebular effects.) Is there a way to land on planets that have life on them (that is, not boring ol' asteroids) and perhaps stay there, living off the land for a while where no one can find you but for your radio pollution?<p>Sorry if this is all irrelevant to your particular implementation, but I've been planning my own similar venture for a while.",1207127035

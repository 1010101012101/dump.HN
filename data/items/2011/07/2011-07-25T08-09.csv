Want to know why the shuttle (actually all space missions) took off in florida, were controlled in Alabama, and landed in California. Senators from Alabama, California, and Florida wrote their tender that way.<p>There is secret then there is ITAR. A lot of astromechanics, guidance and tracking is still under the control of the DOD. They'd have a hard time not going through them.<p>Goals, just like the, now, International Space Station have a ways of changing.

When some artist or label wants me to remix something, I'll always avoid listening to the original work - I'd just receive the samples and midi data, even better if the filenames won't give anything (like the song structure) away, and start working on my interpretation of those loose pieces that would later develope into my idea of which parts should be key, emphasized or not considered at all, which may differ a lot from what the original artist had in mind.<p>At least when it comes to audio production and being asked to alter or re-invent the work of someone else, the results will benefit if you don't have a very clear reference point but just a bunch loose jigsaw pieces, that don't have any right or wrong combination attached.<p>I thought this approach might be relevant to the topic as it seems like an extension of the idea the article describes: If you try to make something different, it's helpful not to know how it's done ""right"".",1311584292

They've given me a bias, yes, but lots of other sample points I've gathered indicate that allocation is broken, and that it's not a priority to fix it. Nooglers have to be prepared to sink or swim.<p>A. Inevitably in a company of this size, certain groups and certain job categories have more trouble filling positions than others.<p>B. The technology stack at Google is deep and complex, has poor useability, and requires time to acquire fluency in. Given a choice any group will recruit experienced Googlers over nooglers.<p>C. Combine A and B and you end up in a situation where nooglers are, by and large, shoveled into large projects that 'nobody wants to go to'.<p>D. In theory you get to chat with 6 different groups. In practice things are far more perfunctory. 2 or even 1 is not uncommon (running out of time like prospero is common: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2801016"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2801016</a>). If you indicate the weakest sense of 'yeah I could work in this team,' prepare to receive no more options.<p>E. The difference in quality of service (response time, level of understanding of <i>your</i> situation) between hiring and allocation is night and day. It's obvious why: hiring has to interact with recruits before they commit to joining, while allocation interacts after.<p>F. Even if you had 6 options, you're still chatting with managers in the presence of a huge information imbalance. You have nothing to go on but what they tell you. Even without meaning to be misleading or dishonest, they're unlikely to give you more than a perfunctory understanding of what your prospective team does, what it's working on (they wouldn't have mentioned Google+), or what skills it requires (rarely what you were interviewed about).<p>---<p>Google's a great place to work, and it's been very good to me. I've learned huge quantities working here. None of these problems are insurmountable. I see signs that they're seasonal; they gradually get worse for a time until they start impacting metrics, at which point leadership focuses on them and fixes them for a time.

There are things about communcation (non-verbal for example) that you can not have over the internet. Also a relationship will never reach the depth of a comparable real life relationship, if you never see the other person.<p>From that post it is pretty clear that you have nearly no experience with human beings (who consider writing to 400 people for no real reason creepy and call one-month-old-relationships not friendship) and also don't like to have. That itself is okay from my point of view. But it also means that you can not do anything connection related. You are just not the type of person for that. Don't take it too personal. I myself am not the want-to-know-everybody type. That's why I can easily recognise someone who has the same illusions I had when I was younger (and to some degree probably still have).<p>Another tip I want to give you just to help you not ""burn your hands"": If you make one relationship in 1 or 2 years that you can really call a friendship, then you are more successful in that job then most people! Your count at the moment is not 50, it is zero. You don't know how people are different if you really learn to know them, how many people are nice to you for a short term, but actually don't care about you and also how many people are out there who want to gain from your disadvantage.

If you believe that anonymous boards like 4chan provide a gathering place for the already antisocial, getting rid of 4chan doesn't get rid of the antisocial.  They'll find some other way to gather and/or express their frustrations with society.  I'd argue that it's possible that sites like 4chan provide an outlet for some people, preventing them from expressing their frustration ""in real life.""<p>For the record, I consider the real-name-only position you've advocated on this article to be a bit extreme (I believe I also replied to another of your comments).  Feel free to desire a place, web site, etc. that satisfies every one of your whims and expectations, but don't do so in a way that forces others to conform.  Maybe they see value to themselves and to society in the things you personally dislike.",1311581960

Can you do that same SQL query in Riak in a simpler way?  Will the Riak query ever benefit from indexing, or does it map against the entire dataset every time?<p>Also, in the Riak query (and the example SQL) there is a hardcoded 18.  In SQL you can use bind parameters to ensure that there is no chance of an injection attack.  How would you do this in Riak?  It seems like you would have to escape the value into the JS code you are sending to the server?  Code generation is a huge pain, and string concatenation isn't going to cut it, but that sad state of affairs is what I see here: <a href=""https://github.com/basho/riaktant/blob/master/examples/log-hotspots-per-hour.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/riaktant/blob/master/examples/log-h...</a><p>That code is linked from the Riak documentation, and is ugly as sin.  Do you have to specify queries against indexes based on what was indexed?  In Postgresql, the query planner will make use of whatever indexes are available if they will help performance, but the SQL will execute with our without those indexes.  In Riak it appears that it will simply map-reduce all data unless you specify a 'search' something or other to narrow it down, but that 'search' functionality is on the outside of the map-reduce, so the developer has to know which fields are indexed and which are not, and there isn't much hope of more complex index enabled joins.",1311581641

The value of very old bug free software will be so great that people and organizations will not push for new features. In my future world this will largely be open source code.<p>A counter to my future world with very high quality but slowly changing software would be the advent of strong AI. I can&#x27;t imagine strong AI that would not quickly, robustly, and continuously rewrite itself in a safe sandbox then rapid redeployment scenario.",1431269967

The entitlement is different now as well.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how far my school in particular has fallen in reality while in perception (god awful rankings) have them higher than ever.

Revolution has always been a shitshow and I don&#x27;t even want to think how it would look given technological advancement since the last time around.<p>There&#x27;s reason to hope. As a nation we have faced bigger issues than this and come out on top. Besides, there are still a handful of decent ways out. Social policy like reducing the workweek to restore supply/demand balance in the labor market could work. So could basic/minimum income, although I suspect that it&#x27;s politically untenable even though it would be cheaper in the big picture. The least efficient but most probable (IMO) approach would be to grow the size of our creaking, bloated menagerie of inefficient social programs.<p>So far, capitalist societies have generally been far better than Marx assumed at figuring out how to implement the minimum possible social policy to stave off rebellion. I don&#x27;t know whether to call it optimistic or pessimistic, but I suspect the trend will continue. Hopefully we won&#x27;t go full Orwell in the process, but I wouldn&#x27;t put money on it. We&#x27;re already turnkey-Orwell and I think most of us can tell which way the wind is blowing.<p>More optimistically, I think there&#x27;s also a chance that market dynamics will shift for the better due to technological change. Sure, 3D printing has been overhyped to the moon and back, but if rents are increasing while the inefficiency of distributed production is decreasing, then eventually there&#x27;s going to be a crossing point. Once everyone has self-replicating farms, power shifts back to the people and free market dynamics start working <i>for</i> the masses instead of <i>against</i> them. It&#x27;ll require a ton of effort and investment to make it happen, but that makes it just the sort of thing to provide opportunity to the HN crowd :)<p>/crazy speculation",1431269894

9520061,comment,9519575,9519913,0,0,henk53,,,">Spring therefore is, was, and always will be at least a generation or two ahead.<p>It should indeed be the idea that Java EE is behind. Its stated purpose is to standardize that what has been proven to work. It doesn&#x27;t aim to be highly innovative. Instead, it aims to be a stable base on which other technologies can build without having to be afraid that the platform changes underneath them every few months, and without much fear that the platform suddenly changes directions radically.<p>Keeping that in mind it&#x27;s funny that CDI is so much more innovative, modern and powerful when compared to Spring Beans. CDI (and by extension Java EE) engaged in the no-XML revolution when Spring was still trying to put MORE code into their proprietary XML format. I&#x27;ve seen Spring applications that were ~50k lines of Java code and ~150k of Spring XML code. Gives a whole other meaning to the term XML hell.<p>And let&#x27;s not start about the -contextual- injections and the powerful extension mechanism that CDI pioneered well before Spring was even thinking about such things.<p>Here Spring is at least 2 generations behind Java EE. And before you start about it, no, CDI was <i>not</i> inspired by Spring. Guice and both JSF native beans and EJB were CDI&#x27;s inspirations.<p>>JEE requires an old-school big honking app server such as WebLogic or JBoss. Lighter-weight alternatives such as TomEE are only just now starting to become suitable for production use.<p>JBoss is NOT old-school and big honking (whatever that means). The download size of JBoss is about 110MB, and it starts in about a second. 10 seconds with an app that contains hundreds to thousands of beans.<p>Compare that to a typical Spring app, where the downloaded size of all things you need easily exceeds 200MB and the war itself is a 100MB or so. A war for Java EE is often some 1 to 2MB for a BIG application. Go figure.<p>A Spring app with so many beans takes up a minute to boot, at least. Granted, I last checked about 2 years ago, maybe it&#x27;s better now.<p>TomEE has been viable to be used for quite some time, and next to TomEE there&#x27;s also Resin and Liberty web profile which are about as small (some 30MB).<p>>Moreover, &quot;standards&quot; notwithstading... you do get locked in to your particular app server, and will experience breakage when migrating to a different vendor who bundles different libraries implementing those standards.<p>You may get small breakages, but you at least have a chance to migrate!<p>Imagine migrating your 500k loc application from Spring to Play. Not going to happen. With Java EE I&#x27;ve migrated applications between all major servers. Sure, there were small things breaking, but on average it took me and the team about 2 weeks to fix. 2 weeks is NOTHING compared to a total migration to another platform which can take years.<p>>With modern Spring Boot, everything you need gets bundled into a self-contained and safe archive file.<p>This is only a fairly recent development for Spring, and Java EE vendors have solutions here as well. TomEE has been capable of doing this for years, and recently there have been solutions for GlassFish (<a href=""http://www.payara.co.uk/introducing_payara_micro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.payara.co.uk/introducing_payara_micro</a>) and JBoss (<a href=""http://wildfly.org/news/2015/05/05/WildFly-Swarm-Released/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wildfly.org/news/2015/05/05/WildFly-Swarm-Released/</a>)<p>>Putting an app server inside your JAR might sound inefficient at first, but it&#x27;s a devops dream and is ideally suited for today&#x27;s trend toward microservice architecture.<p>From the very article this HN post links to, that startup is doing something like that already with Java EE.<p>>Besides, a typical app with Spring and Tomcat bundled is STILL a fraction of TomEE&#x27;s size.<p>Yeah, sure. See my comment above. TomEE is some 35 MB and contains nearly everything you need. Try adding Spring libs and all their dependencies, as well as Hibernate and a transaction manager to your war. That 35MB gets eaten away pretty quickly. And please don&#x27;t think that just because you only put dependencies in the pom.xml file that the data is not really there. Take a look at the final war that&#x27;s build. This is often way larger than 35MB when Spring is used.<p>>I find JEE&#x27;s CDI to be a clunky mess in contrast<p>I think it&#x27;s exactly the other way around...<p>>Spring these days steers developers toward Thymeleaf templates, which are consistent in usage with most of the modern JavaScript frameworks they are likely using already. JEE steers developers toward JSF, which even in its modern form tries to simulate concepts from .NET WebForms<p>Thymeleaf unfortunately is not very memory efficient compared to JSF&#x27;s Facelets. See <a href=""http://www.jsfcentral.com/articles/understanding_jsf_performance_3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jsfcentral.com/articles/understanding_jsf_perform...</a><p>And Facelets/JSF uses modern templating based on plain HTML these days.<p>>Microsoft has meanwhile walked away from this as outdated bad practice)<p>No, Microsoft walked away since they had never been able to put the effort in to create a next gen version of their platform. In JSF terms WebForms is still at JSF 1.1/1.2.<p>ASP.NET WebForms never had its JSF 2.0 release, and it doesn&#x27;t have things like PrimeFaces and OmniFaces.<p>PrimeFaces DID try to make a component set for WebForms, but gave up because the underlying technology was just too outdated.<p>>If you take a Spring problem to StackOverflow, you will have an answer within minutes.<p>Uhm, you can&#x27;t be serious here, are you?<p>Ever heard of BalusC?<p>The JSF community is HUGE on stackoverflow, things are answered pretty quickly and there are about twice as many questions (and answers!) there compared to Spring MVC.<p>>By comparison, the JEE &quot;community&quot; is practically non-existent...<p>On the contrary, it&#x27;s really big. Every sub spec has a public JIRA where anyone can submit ideas and looking at the last release indeed many ideas have been implemented that were proposed by the community.<p>I think you have 2003/2004 in mind and never looked back.

I&#x27;ve read through the source and it mentions blocking etc. but I didn&#x27;t see quite what I was looking for.<p>So here&#x27;s the deal: at one point I was working on laziness library to treat promises as lazy values, and the problem that I ran into was that JS doesn&#x27;t let you overload the operators `+`, `-`, etc. so that the API needs to export things like `Lazy.plus(p1, p2, p3)`. By itself that&#x27;s not so bad -- it even makes everything look lispy in a strangely C syntax -- but it was sufficiently heavy that I kind of abandoned the project.<p>So from my understanding, the `+` can only work if the `ajax()` calls now block <i>the global browser JS thread</i>. Is that true? Does the above function even work synchronously, if I call it?<p>Of course, to <i>actually</i> use this function we have to use `Syncify.revert` which converts it back into a callback-based function. Does Syncify.revert have to somehow parse the function? How does it &quot;stick its own context&quot; into the function that it&#x27;s calling without something complicated like dynamic variable scope? Or did you find a way to hack dynamic scope into JS?",1431269151

The #1 key fact is that $350/kWh DC at 500 cycles is not at all impressive.  It&#x27;s somewhere between 50% and 200% more expensive than existing products.  Despite claiming to be familiar with a range of battery chemistries, they failed to note that the 2 kW output limitation would not apply to those existing solutions.<p>There are three good things about the Powerwall, only one of which seems to be getting any airtime at all:<p>1. It offers much higher energy density than VRLA, especially in kWh/kg (kWh/m^3 is somewhat less impressive).  This makes it suitable for applications where lower mass is critical, like laptops and cell phones.  Residential grid-tie backup is not one of them, however.<p>2. It&#x27;s a sealed unit.  Taking maintenance-free to another level, this is a &quot;no user-serviceable parts inside&quot; design.  There are no terminals to touch (or corrode), no vents for electrolyte or gases, no series wiring to be done.  For people who are intimidated by anything involving electricity or chemistry, this is a tremendous marketing achievement.<p>3. The operating voltage presented to the system integrator is much higher than 48V.  As they mentioned, this makes it easier to integrate with grid-tie inverters, which while less flexible than the do-it-all off-grid/grid-tie inverters usually designed to work with 48V batteries, are also somewhat cheaper and more familiar to installers.<p>That&#x27;s it.  If those advantages outweigh the high price per kWh, poor power output, and low cycle lifetime of the battery itself for your application, the Powerwall is right for you.  Otherwise, it isn&#x27;t.  Look for a VRLA or (if you&#x27;re willing to do occasional maintenance to save even more money) FLA solution instead.  You could even look at other chemistries like nickel-iron.  Lithium just isn&#x27;t the right chemistry for this application; it&#x27;s too expensive and the advantages it offers are unimportant.",1431268005

A per frame arena, a per level arena, each subsystem gets its own arena... etc. Shove anything that would be in a dynamic array into ring buffer, unless you can spare the holes in the arena (for per-frame stuff you usually can), of fill it as you allocate. Anything that has a more complicated lifetime than this either gets shoved into a free list or a pool.<p>And then thats it. Takes a little getting used to (mainly because dynamic arrays become a kind of bad idea) but once you&#x27;re used to it you really never spend much time worrying about memory management. Caller vs callee free? Neither, it lives in the arena (etc).<p>It&#x27;s also extremely fast, as arenas are more or less the cheapest memory allocation strategy, and you can very easily bound the memory usage of your program (needed in game dev a lot, for min requirements), since its patterns are so predictable.<p>Not sure how well it would translate to other areas... Lack of strings in game dev probably make this much more feasible that it might otherwise be.",1431267563

But so does booting Windows 9 on an old 386.<p>Why do you bring up J2EE? The article is about <i>Java EE</i>, which is really, really fast in starting/stopping. On my 3 year old desktop (Ubuntu 14.10, 3.4Ghz i7, 16GB RAM, Samsung 830 SSD), JBoss starts in exactly 1 second. Liberty takes 1.5 orso, GlassFish takes between 2 and 3 seconds.<p>That&#x27;s not a LONG time, IFF you need to restart.<p>For typical JSF you don&#x27;t need to restart at all. You make a change on the page and reload the browser. That&#x27;s it.<p>With a standard JVM you can also make changes inside Java code, as long as those changes are inside a method. The IDE will hot deploy only the changed code and the JVM will hot reload it. If you want to structurally modify classes (add/remove methods, add new base class) then you can still hot reload them, but you need to install JRebel. This has little to do with JSF, and more with Java in general.<p>>you can&#x27;t see what you screen looks like until you serve the page from your J2EE server<p>Not true. JSF lets you create pages using normal HTML, which can be previewed from their source.<p>>Also JSF is an unnecessary abstraction over HTML : it is much easier to maintain state on client itself using any of Javascript libraries like React or Backbone or others.<p>What&#x27;s easier is perhaps personal, but I don&#x27;t think the abstraction is unnecessary. First of all when using normal HTML to create pages there&#x27;s not much abstraction in the first place, it&#x27;s normal HTML. Then the advantage is that you can VERY EASILY bind input/output to the server. Client-to-server data binding is JSF&#x27;s strong point.<p>And it&#x27;s not just easy, you also get validation thrown in there for very little cost and JSF is aware of what it has rendered when processing data that&#x27;s being send back. This allows it to mitigate certain attack vectors, like the mass attribute assignment vulnerability in RoR.<p>>you will be suprised by the amount of backend code you will have to write.<p>Funny, how my backing beans are always really small and simple, despite the pages being of arbitrary complexity.<p>>Ultimately ,you will eventually resort to hacks and you page state and you JSF state for the page will deverge.<p>Rarely an issue if you half know what you&#x27;re doing. Client side JSF can make all the changes it wants, and when it&#x27;s time to update to the server you send that data to the server. Where&#x27;s the problem?<p>In every client-server architecture there are sync issues to be aware of. With a js client and JAX-RS the server can also be out of sync if other pages or other clients made changes. This is not unique to JSF.",1431267376

Nearly every problem we had with JSF (which manishsharan listed correctly) were non existent in the other frameworks. Not only that but they were mostly a breeze to work with. Once you start using JSF extensively you know immediately that it&#x27;s a standardized platform becaue everything is a compromise.

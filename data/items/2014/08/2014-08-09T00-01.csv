They require specific knowledge that cannot be deduced because it is fundamentally arbitrary.

Which in your example, the unions themselves eventually become too powerful or negatively effecting the job market and upward mobility of smaller players. We would see benefits in the early days then eventually reach by a stasis where everything starts moving extremely slowly and consumed by bureaucratic process.<p>Then only those embedded within the union system benefit, while competing global markets without constraints operate more efficiently. While smaller players in the job market start hiring less due to the high bar needed to hire union workers.<p>I&#x27;ve witnessed this first hand as an electrician in my family ran a successful business, until the workers organized into a union and he had to shut it down because their demands made it completely unprofitable (they demanded expensive benefits programs and high wages, keep in mind we live in Canada with public healthcare).

However, MIT Press is excellent. There&#x27;s a big range of support and quality control among publishers. Zero Books is also quite successful as a nontraditional quasi-academic press. They&#x27;ve developed a niche style that&#x27;s popular in a certain audience (academic but readable and <i>short</i>, ~70-100 page books on a specific subject). So authors publishing a &quot;Zero Book&quot; through Zero get a bunch of built-in exposure to the audience the publisher has cultivated, in part through marketing (the brand is known, individual academics often aren&#x27;t), and in part because readers trust it to do some quality/style control so the books in their catalog fit the expected style.<p>As a reader I like finding publishers like that because it reduces the noise for me considerably and improves discoverability: browsing <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-titles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/new-titles</a> or <a href=""http://www.zero-books.net/forthcoming-titles.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zero-books.net/forthcoming-titles.html</a> is actually manageable.

8155849,comment,8154014,8154014,1,0,zackmorris,,,"I&#x27;m concerned that this is one of the great problems that humanity can&#x27;t deal with, like the tragedy of the commons.  Only a small percentage of the population recognizes that freedom from labor is a positive thing.  So the way I see it, we have two choices:<p>1) let the small percentage automate their way to freedom and the rest can join if they wish<p>2) adopt automation on a wide, institutional scale the way we did with public education and social security<p>Unfortunately, with the political slant of the country leaning so far towards libertarianism at the moment (government = bad, taxes = bad, welfare = bad, etc) I am becoming more convinced every day that we will go with option #1 and create a two-tier society.  The tiny elite today has trouble discerning where unearned income comes from.  They don’t seem to care if their capital gains come from a working class or automation.  As someone who dabbled in dead end manual labor jobs for most of my 20s, I find that appalling.  It’s like trying to talk to someone about vegetarianism who has never slaughtered an animal by hand.<p>So, these things will probably go the way they always go.  A small percentage who sacrifice tremendously for the greater good of society, with the masses riding the coattails of progress glibly unaware of it.  I suppose in the end that that has always been the American way, or at the very least, the western way.<p>Maybe a path towards enlightenment is to picture a day in the near future as we approach the singularity and find that economic gain is no longer tied to labor.  It’s going to be a bit like winning the lottery, here and there, small amounts at first but growing larger every day.  I will believe that automation has arrived when I begin seeing random acts of selflessness by people who recognize that financially, they have arrived.  As in, randomly receiving a call one day that your credit card bill has been paid in full.  Or maybe a city receives a large donation for the building of bike paths.  Or a solar panel installer goes door to door and gives people free kits to get off the grid and never pay another electric bill.  I think small, targeted amounts of money injected directly into the system like that could be quite disruptive.<p>So in the end such ominous changes could come to pass with a whimper instead of a bang.  It could be one of the great advances in civilization that people thousands of years from now look back at in awe, wondering how we ever transitioned from a dog-eat-dog hierarchy to egalitarian anarchy.  I guess they will have just had to have been there, witnessing the epic stupidity that we’ve witnessed over the course of our lives.  Stepping back from that, rejecting it summarily is not such a hard thing to do.  Not if you grok that the other side of the threshold is not just possible, but probable.  And then be willing to take a leap of faith and persevere long enough to see it through.",1407544810

8155847,comment,8154213,8154213,1,0,rgo,,,"Do you know why they are acquihiring you?<p>Bootstrapped or not, VC funded or not, profitable or not, a company&#x27;s value is given by its potential. This potential will be measured (with different metrics, some of them quite subjective) by both parties, then negotiated hopefully to somewhere in between. In your case, you need to come up with your number by best estimating what the value of your team will be once acquired and assigned your new task.<p>Ie. you are making a cool AI board but you got no traction (hence no VC, revenue or customers). Now Intel wants to acquihire you to make their next generation of synaptic chips something cool. Just lately IBM closed a deal valued at $100M with a Chinese manufacturer for their synaptic chips. Since they are looking at an internal BP for the acquihire of a $100M potential, a 10x ROI puts you all at $10M. Now you have your own BP that you can use to support your intended price for the deal.<p>Once you have that potential value, you will want to figure your opportunity cost and BATNA by looking at the potential value of your product or company in X reasonable years.

8155844,comment,8154797,8154797,13,0,bcoates,,,"I&#x27;ve used this technique before for image searching, here&#x27;s some tips:<p>The algorithm presented here can be summarized as &quot;Take the low-frequency DCT components of the luminance channel, quantized down to one bit&quot;. Hashing is a very misleading term for what you get from it: In particular, it doesn&#x27;t have anything like the uniform coverage of the output space you would expect from a hash function, as almost all encountered images exist in a very small range of hashes. Also, the bits in the hash are not all created equal; assuming you encode them in a zig-zag pattern truncation is equivalent to a low-pass filter, so if you want to make the hash different sizes while matching on the same image elements you&#x27;ll want to alter the quantization amount, not the output DCT size (this is directly equivalent to what JPEG does, which uses a fixed DCT size but lossily quantizes the information in it to varying degrees for different compression quality settings). Experiment with different quantization techniques; you don&#x27;t have to treat every bit in the output the same.<p>This technique is only suitable for a small subset of the image files that you will encounter in the real world: it&#x27;s mostly unsuitable for anything but photographs and photograph-like images (3d renders, paintings, etc.) Many classes of image have no useful distinguishing information in the low-frequency luminance space, such as screenshots, pictures of text, line drawings, many forms of graph and diagram, most &quot;clip art&quot; style drawings, pictures that include layout elements in the image file (like most of the meme/sucessories/demotivator format pictures you&#x27;ll see on imageboards). Of course, an image with a flat or heavily compressed luminance channel will yield no information at all.<p>You don&#x27;t have to do anything special to match flipped images, as you should be using (iirc) DCT-II that has the same output for a mirror image. It&#x27;s insensitive to scaling and mild translation.<p>For debugging purposes, note that the transformation performed is lossy but easily reversible: you can undo all the steps but quantization to generate a &#x27;stereotype&#x27; image of a particular hash value and its neighbors. There is no more information available to the matching algorithm than you can see with your own eyes with the round-trip conversion, so if the round-tripped image preserves important distinguishing detail the matching will work and if it turns the image into a meaningless grey smear you&#x27;ll get tons of false positive matches.",1407544724

The opposite of &quot;awful&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;shoots out rainbows that dazzle and disorient the viewer&quot;.<p>The logo should look like it was done carefully and with attention to detail. It should be balanced and pleasant to look at. Even subconsciously, people will pick up on those qualities (or their lack) and infer the same about your company.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to slag on your logo. I know it&#x27;s probably not a priority for you. But it does a disservice to others to say, &quot;Look how easy it is to solve your logo problem!&quot; when the end result you got was actually pretty poor.<p>In particular, the outermost &quot;radio&quot; arc cuts unpleasantly close to the &quot;S&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t match any of the other spacing and makes the &quot;S&quot; look like it has some weird thing attached to it. The other arc is thinner for no clear reason and the spacing between it and the dot over the &quot;i&quot; and the outer arc is inconsistent.<p>To my eye, the whole set of arcs is too tall and makes the outline of the entire logo look unbalanced.<p>Also, the kerning around the first &quot;e&quot; is bad.<p>I understand you think no one cares about your logo, but you took the time to animate it and put it a video. Why not at least drop a bit of cash beforehand and make sure it&#x27;s worth reusing?<p>Argh. I hate being negative without being helpful.

A &#x27;do not hire&#x27; list is in essence a Blacklist, which if employed between companies with overlapping skill sets (IE trying to block an engineer moving between Apple and Microsoft) then this is certainly disgusting.<p>Poaching is the active targeting of employees of other companies, which when done in the umbrella of an investors holdings is bad form (don&#x27;t bite the hand that feeds you). When done to another company is generally a bad idea if you expect to have to have amicable dealings with them (license patents, buy parts, etc). However, if they&#x27;re a direct rival and there&#x27;s no foreseeable reason to be on good terms with them, there is no reason to not poach their employees other than the reason you know you&#x27;re not acquiring a loyal employee, but one loyal to the money.<p>A &#x27;do not hire&#x27; list is an attempt to blacklist anyone who essentially leaves whatever the umbrella is of its reach, which is an attempt to place a monetary cost on anyone trying to leave the corporate fold. It would be like a bartender breaking the legs of anyone trying to leave. Anyone else who was planning on leaving isn&#x27;t going to, but they&#x27;re certainly not going to be buying drinks and that&#x27;s really going to drive down profits when the bar is at capacity and no one is drinking.

I see knowing about software, electronics and &quot;technology&quot; as a general knowledge, in the same way that I can speak and read.<p>Hacker News is a fantastic community, filled with rational, clever and moderate contributors who write stuff which is a a pleasure to read and learn from.<p>The rest of the popular web seems in thrall by the new stuff and doesn&#x27;t see things quite so rationally. Its not easy to pull the wool over the eyes of the HN crowd. I love that kind of interaction, where people have a level of understanding that allows genuine technical merit to be apparent.<p>My new full time job is designing machines to keep sick people alive whilst their bodies are repaired.

A few of them were brilliant (the Butthole Surfers, IMSHO).  I like some of MJ's music, but frankly I don't think he was a genius songwriter.  Great performer, and had some nice hit songs.<p>I think something is gone with that era, in that now it's just the artist and his/her computer.  No big setup, no 'control room', no tape assist punching in the vocals.  No girlfriends snoring on the couch.  And obviously, no band playing everything at once (that wasn't even really going on by the time I was working, though you did do things like bass/drums/guitar together with a rough vocal if it made sense for the song).<p>Like stained glass and the Saturn V, the art of making these kinds of records is going to be lost forever.",1246614955

This is nothing to get worked up over -- it is a fundamental fact of our industry.

685858,comment,685698,685765,0,0,dflock,,,"It depends on how quickly you kill them and how you do it. Cholera victims go out in a flood of infectious watery diarrhea, thus spreading the virus to people in the vicinity and into the ground water, passing the infection along. Ebola does something horribly similar, except with blood and liquefied internal organs.\nThe diarrhea you get with cholera is mostly your body trying to flush out the bacteria and toxins from your gut. Cholera has evolved to exploit and exacerbate this defense mechanism to spread itself. Sneezing is that same principle, for respiratory infections.\nThese dramatic death throws can be viewed as a very aggressive means of the infection passing itself along, after having completely exhausted the capacity of the current host to produce more virus or bacteria. Even though these are both extremely lethal and fast acting diseases, they're both successful, evolutionarily speaking.<p>If there was a flu strain that made you sneeze so much that you eventually died from it (dehydration, hemorrhage?), this would be similar. As it is, it's generally your immune system going nuclear, an opportunistic infection, underlying poor health or a combination that kills you with influenza.<p>Quite a lot of the pandemic potential of diseases depends on us and the opportunities we give them. Ebola has thus far proved too lethal and too quick to spread very widely - and because it's a terrifying disease, we've cracked down on it very hard. Cholera - which is actually more lethal and even faster acting than Ebola - was the scourge of the 19th century, killing tens of millions of people, before we figured out about pubic health and sanitation, taking away it's opportunities.<p>So, no. Killing people isn't an evolutionary mistake for an infectious organism. It's an evolutionary adaptation - a way of pumping out as many new bacteria or viruses into the environment as fast as possible and then moving on, before the hosts immune system catches up with you. If you take it easy and go for the slow burn, generally the hosts immune system will wipe you out. If you want to do that, then you need a different evolutionary adaptation to evade the immune system for long periods, like HIV does.",1246614548

Every word or action they send is a message that can be either judgmental or developmental. The problem here is that the majority of the time parents, teachers and coaches do what they think is best for the child, without realizing that they are doing exactly the opposite. Sometimes, by praising children, they diminish them. Praise should be given to the effort and persistence rather than intelligence or talent. For example, if a child worked hard on his homework then he must be recognized, but if another child did the homework without much effort at all, but achieved the expected results, instead of praising him you should give him a more difficult task. The growth mindset in education focuses on expanding the students' knowledge and ways of thinking and investigating the world. Grades are not seen as an end in themselves, but as a means to continue to grow. The best thing to do is to teach children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, enjoy effort, and keep on learning.<p>“Praise should deal, not with the child's personality attributes, but with his efforts and achievements“. - Haim Ginott",1246612284

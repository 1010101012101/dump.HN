3288976,comment,3288671,3288885,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Depends on what time period we are talking about - if over 4 years, then $1 million is a handsome return for an early stage (non founding, first 10) engineer at a successful startup.  If over 8 years, then $1 million equity return works out to be $125K/year - not as exciting.  I'd suggest the odds for a $1million equity return over eight years is closer to 1/20.  Still lousy odds, but a great engineer can shift them by making the company successful.",1322539138

3288971,comment,3285670,3286107,1,0,Cieplak,,,"No, thank you for writing such a wonderful piece. I just glanced over the first few chapters for the first time in over a year and was delighted. I remember stepping through that bit of assembly in chapter one with a pen and paper, then running the two js versions of the code in my browser.  Some commenters have criticized the prose of the book; for me this really helped contextualize certain things that seasoned programmers take for granted.  I would argue that this is more approachable for a beginner than Ritchie & Kernighan's book or SICP.  But I suppose those aren't necessarily beginner books. For some reason, I like your book quite a lot more than a few introductory Python books I've read.  Although Ruby is far more beautiful and useful to me than JS these days, I think it is a very bad idea to force object orientation onto beginners.  It is better to let people ask for it when they need it, than to force it onto beginners (I can't help but think of Yegge's Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns).  Accordingly, I think JS is a very suitable learning language because it provides a taste of object-oriented and functional programming, while maintaining a familiar C style syntax. Also, it's very powerful for event oriented programming, as demonstrated by node.js. I stopped programming in js because of frustration for lack of lisp-style macros, but perhaps clojurescript can fix this.",1322539077

3288967,comment,3287344,3287344,1,0,gwern,,,"Yes, it's a good essay, but here's the thing - <i>it's no longer the future</i>. We have Bush's ideas implemented. It's a vision of the present filtered through the blinkers of the past (even a genius can only be so prescient). Its interest is now purely historical & dead; it can no longer be any call for action or rethinking.<p>What's a vision of the future? Sad to say, Douglas Engelbart's 1962 ""Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework"" <a href=""http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html</a> still is far beyond anything we have right now.",1322539040
3288965,comment,3288671,3288928,3,0,aspensmonster,,,"I should have clarified. I was trying to make an observation on ""employment"" in general, whether you're treated with dignity as an employee or not. Even if you love your job, work <= 40 hours a week, have every weekend and holiday off, see your family every day, and life is going just swell, you're still probably never going to see _profits_ going to you, precisely because you're not considered an owner. You're a cost. And that deal may work out nicely. A six figure salary is nothing to sneeze at. But you're still not an owner. And in all likelyhood, you will never see past 7 figures.<p>I suppose I think there might be a model out there that better reflects ownership and the concepts of who earned what. More than anything, I don't believe the owner ""earns"" all of the profits of a company. The [owner + every last other employee in the organization] ""earned"" the profits. But while every other employee is more or less capped in their earnings, the owner gets the profit.<p>I understand the concept: take on a big risk, be rewarded for said risk with big gains. I suppose I just don't think anyone should be rewarded for winning a lottery of circumstance. If I owned a company, I don't think I'd see myself as having ""earned"" tens of millions of dollars and I don't think I'd be OK with taking home millions while the hundreds of staff beneath me did all of the brute work.<p>But then again, I've never owned a company. Maybe if I did I'd feel a whole lot differently about the whole thing.",1322538963

3288963,comment,3285742,3285902,3,0,jessriedel,,,"Frankly, I was pretty blown away by how poorly it's understood by physicists (although they are probably better than biologist).  Even in experimental particle physics, where statistics are essential, the statistical techniques are all self-taught and seat-of-the-pants.  I am confident everything being released by the major particle physics experiments is statistically sound after it goes through the collaboration review process, but there are certainly poor inferences being made at the level of the individual physicist.  I listened to at least a couple of confused conversations between smart particle physicists about whether frequentism or Bayesianism was ""right"".",1322538930

That's another arrangement that sucks for everyone --- the readers, the writers, and the editors --- <i>except</i> for the publishers.<p>This strikes me as the same as saying ""save the newspapers, they're the only ones who can run classified ads!"". Except, the newspapers do other stuff. What else do the publishers do?<p>The arrangement we have today made a lot more sense when books lived or died on the retail channel, to which access was a scarcity acquired and allocated (""curated"", to use their words) by the publishers.

As with Strassen this new bound is an asymptotic bound for the technique meaning that you technically need matrices of infinite size before you realise that complexity. Whilst you can take an algorithm such as Strassen and really work out how many steps it will take, it is less straightforward for the CW style algorithms how many steps it is going to take for a given matrix. So my comparison is very much an approximation just to give the flavour of how big the matrices likely have to be for this algorithm to make a difference.",1322537770

The only thing I can think of that people typically do that is processor intensive is HD playback, and that is easily accelerated nowadays.<p>It's not always about absolute performance, it's about ""good enough"" performance.  If ARM is going to supply good enough performance with the additional benefits of being cheaper and more portable, then why NOT use it?<p>This isn't about ARM versus Intel.  This is about having adequately powered portables.<p>Intel is losing the low-end CPU market.  That much is true.  But the low-end CPU market is the new middle-end CPU market.  I think we are going to see an age where more and more people have ""low-end"" portables as their main computers.  The barrier between low-end, middle-end, and high-end has shifted significantly I think.  A few years ago, we all had uses for high-end computers.  Nowadays, what would be considered high-end is a waste for most people.<p>Also, we can't forget the impact of the cloud on this.  We don't need a lot of computing power locally now.  For many of the types of applications that one would need high cpu for, the cloud potentially provides those solutions for us.<p>I, for one, don't see myself trading in my desktop at work anytime soon.

More recently, the high end has dropped down to at most about 95W for non-server chips, but it still means you have to go back to the drawing board before you have a CPU that can work in tablets and smaller devices.<p>So far, Intel has shown that they aren't very good at simultaneously developing two parallel product lines of CPUs.

If you have no interest in making a social application, which to Facebook means you fundamentally at bare minimum are going to need their friends list (or they, and I, would question what you even mean by ""social""), then you should not use Facebook's authentication mechanism.<p>Really, it comes down to this statement you made: ""this is one of the appealing parts of facebook auth, imho"" <- Facebook agrees, and it is Facebook's vision that that is the reason you are using their login provider. If you weren't intending to do that, in their model you are doing something actively confusing and wrong, not something that requires fewer permissions. ;P<p>""This is with the most basic authentication mechanism that facebook offers."" <- so yes, it is. This is their offering: a login mechanism that isn't just a login mechanism, but in fact a way to build social applications where you can filter content based on users friends, show users how their friends interact with your content, and generally provide an experience based around ""the social graph"". If you really just want a login provider, you should go talk to Yahoo! or Microsoft, who were both interested in this raw service on various occasions (with lackluster results ;P).<p>It also is not Facebook's fault if ""most apps ask for"" a permission you do not want to grant. In fact, it is the fault of the other users on the service who don't care about granting that permission: instead of complaining to Facebook, you should complain to the developers, and honestly instead of complaining to the developers, you should spend your time educating the public on ""least priviledge"".<p>To instead claim that is Facebook's fault is an exactly analogous argument to claiming that all computing platforms should be closed, as it is then also Google's fault if a lot of developers ask for permission to run native code on their Android devices, instead of just using Java (which is at least memory safe): better to just avoid the whole mess and remove the functionality, right?",1322536476

Having so many designers means they can squeeze out every last MHz, but it also means they need big margins and large volumes to recoup their costs.<p>The other big technical issue is the end of Dennard scaling.  For most of the last three decades, scaling CMOS processes bought you three things: more transistors, higher frequency and lower power. Things are different now. We can't really scale frequency any more because we've run into the power wall. We used to get lower power at the same frequency by scaling the supply voltage, but this also required us to scale the threshold voltage (a device parameter). Unfortunately we can't scale the threshold voltage willy-nilly like in the past because leakage power increases for lower threshold voltages and is now a significant contributor to total power. We still get more transistors per unit area, but it's not clear whether the economic costs of building up new fabs and switching to a new process are offset by the benefits of having more transistors to play with.<p>The bottomline is that it's not clear whether Intel's biggest competitive advantage, that of having a manufacturing process superior to everyone else, is still that much of an advantage.<p>PS. One thing I find truly amazing is that Dennard predicted that we'd run into all these problems back in his landmark paper in 1974!",1322536319

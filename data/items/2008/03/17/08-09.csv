Buying adspace on the page may or may not work.  Well-done viral videos WILL work.<p>A friend of mine got his start out of college making viral videos for companies.  He made one for a company called Winward Reports which has over 1.6 million views.  That's a lot of people, the vast majority of which wouldn't have ever heard of Winward Reports, if not through the video.<p><a href=""http://youtube.com/watch?v=wOTBWlt0-Y0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtube.com/watch?v=wOTBWlt0-Y0</a><p>So buying adspace?  Questionable.  Creating a good, entertaining, engaging ad or viral video and hosting it (free of charge) on YouTube?  Awesome.",1205744324

Since there were no other bidders and the price was just 200m, it's really clear that the real value of all the securities that Bear held is negative. The only question is how much negative.",1205744271

138808,comment,138798,138798,0,0,cperciva,,,"I see no reason to conclude that Alexa and compete aren't both correct.  Note that<p>1. Compete is ""estimat[ing] U.S. traffic"", while Alexa includes international traffic.  Alexa claims that 51% of reddit traffic is US, 12% of scribd traffic is US, and 21% of justin.tv traffic is US; this would explain why Compete (which only reports on US traffic) thinks that reddit and scribd were roughly equal in February, while Alexa thinks that scribd had almost twice as much traffic.<p>2. Compete's ""People Count"" is reporting on how many people visit each site within a month, while Alexa's ""Daily Reach"" is reporting on (presumably) how many people visit each site each day.<p>3. Compete reports absolute numbers, while Alexa reports numbers as a fraction of a total audience (which, one assumes, is growing).  This would explain why Compete shows reddit and scribd growing while Alexa shows reddit remaining fairly static.<p>Now, I'm generally skeptical about such third-party estimates... but this comparison alone doesn't give me any more evidence to support such skepticism.",1205743826

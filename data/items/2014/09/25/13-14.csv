I had people asking me if my first Android phone five years ago was an iPhone, and they exhibited a look that I also would only describe as &quot;let down&quot; or &quot;disappointed&quot;.<p>I use the word &quot;techie&quot; in quotes because, while many of those people would have described themselves as techies, I found they were really just consumers of technology. They had no functional knowledge of how anything worked or how to make anything themselves. To them, the only smartphone (or smartwatch) in existence was the Apple product, because to them the entire point was to brag about acquisition.<p>Even within the demographic of programmers, you&#x27;ll find &quot;techies&quot;. They ask you what programming language or framework you used to build your project, then get disappointed when you didn&#x27;t magically read their minds 6 months in the past and chose their darling flavor. I&#x27;ve got no use for such people.",1411653599

I genuinely don&#x27;t understand why people would want a round smartwatch. I don&#x27;t see how a round screen would provide a good UX (this is why they don&#x27;t make round monitors, or round smartphones).<p>Even if watches are traditionally round, I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to build a UI around the constraints of a circular screen.<p>Whether you implied this, I have seen multiple people voice their preference for a circular smartwatch, so just trying to understand the logic vs. the constraints it would impose.",1411653582

There were several informal aspects to the study, not the least of which being that there were no clearly defined requirements for the system to be implemented (so it was up to each participant to define the scope), but the conclusion is very interesting nonetheless:<p>The Haskell took less time to develop and also resulted in less lines of code than the alternatives, and it produced a runnable prototype that some of the reviewers had a hard time believing wasn&#x27;t a mockup. Many of the alternatives didn&#x27;t even end up with a working system. It should also be noted that the Haskell participants decided to <i>expand</i> the scope of the experiment; i.e. they didn&#x27;t &quot;win&quot; because they implemented a heavily simplified solution, but in fact added extra requirements to their system and still finished earlier!<p>Even though Obj-C wasn&#x27;t included in the study, there were similar enough C-like languages in it, so my bet is that Haskell would have won against it as a rapid prototyping language as well.",1411653513

It is technically possible to design and build a business focused solely on buying lottery tickets for profit (i.e.: buy enough to ensure good enough odds to win) But there are a number of risks. The list below isn&#x27;t exhaustive:<p><pre><code>  * sharing the winning number with someone else\n  * do you buy every single ticket or enough to &quot;virtually guarantee&quot; a win? (and the fewer tickets you buy, the more risky it becomes)\n  * the logistics of purchasing that many tickets\n</code></pre>\nI have even read stories of people trying this before - but haven&#x27;t been able to find the link. The story I remember best is one man hiring  a bunch of people to buy lottery tickets on his behalf.<p>Anyway.

8367130,comment,8359837,8366729,1,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"The basic distinction is this: Natural selection refers to one organism having superior reproduction prospects due to inherent physical factors (strength, speed, height, weight, ability to digest specific foods, ability to detect and respond appropriately to threats, etc.). Natural selection takes place without the awareness of the hosts involved: By the time their relative advantages or disadvantages are in evidence, they are long dead.<p>In other words, natural selection is about fit, that is, how well an organism &quot;fits&quot; or is suited to and environment. (That it what Darwin meant by fitness: Environmental suitability.)<p>Sexual selection refers to overt preferences in mating: A female bower bird chooses the male that builds the &quot;best&quot; bower (a completely useless artifice neither ever use), a human male prefers women with larger breasts (pretty much ditto), a peahen prefers the peacock with the more extravagant tail (ditto for sure, in fact, more extravagant tails are liabilities).<p>Examples are many. The term &quot;runaway sexual selection&quot; is used to refer to exaggerated traits that become prevalent and possibly dominant in specific, local populations (think of human characteristics you associate with certain groups: Sometime, somewhere, someone preferred those slightly larger eyes or slightly curvier hips and over time those became prevalent). These traits are generally completely irrelevant, with zero fitness value.<p>They exist because we think they look/smell good. Why did we come to prefer one over another? The same random variation that causes changes to fitness causes changes to fitness indicators, but those indicators are not necessarily honest signals.",1411653376

I have the first Sony SmartWatch (second in the whole line, released after the LiveView) and it is crap compared to watches that came after like the Pebble, which I also own and use currently.<p>The SmartWatch 2 was a huge improvement over the previous model, but it didn&#x27;t impress me enough at the time to buy it so soon after the last one; I ended up getting the Pebble instead. This one though, looks like what I&#x27;m really looking for in a smart wristwatch. I&#x27;d happily trade my Pebble for one, and probably will once they start selling it in the US.<p>As for the waterproof rating, IP68 would be &quot;no ingress of dust&quot; (the &quot;6&quot; in the rating) and &quot;the equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water (immersion beyond 1m)&quot; (the &quot;8&quot; in the rating). That sounds pretty much waterproof to me. Now, if you mean it&#x27;s not a diver&#x27;s watch, well of course it isn&#x27;t, and never claimed to be.

The shopkeeper pays for it to be replaced, instead of buying a book.<p>Situation 2: There is no window, and there is no need for a window. But the shopkeeper pays for a window anyway, instead of buying a book.<p>Situation 1 is restoring the status quo, situation 2 is financing new production - but they seem equally bad, because in both cases you&#x27;re paying someone to do something that doesn&#x27;t (at the beginning of the situation) need to be done.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that we&#x27;re in situation 2 here, because windows are in fact useful. But zizee&#x27;s original argument was roughly, &quot;let&#x27;s forget all the benefits that we get from windows, this project is paying the wages of glaziers, this money will get taxed and etc.&quot; And I think that <i>that particular</i> argument in favour of this project fails, and I think pravda was correct to point it out.",1411650286

However, you are doing so at almost ram prices.  (I'm speaking of good SSDs, like the X-25E;  which comes to something like $15 per gigabyte; the not so good SSDs have problems of their own.  I have a SSD in my laptop right now that is branded by one of the gamer ram companies, i forget which one. It was pretty cheap, under $2 per gigabyte.  It's pretty nice for reads, for writes, sometimes it is good, but often writes are worse than spinning disk.)     The advantage of just buying the ram is that a good virtual memory management system can automatically optimize to keep the data you access most often in ram.<p>Like I said, i use a SSD in my laptop, a cheap brand and it's small, my laptop doesn't need a lot of storage, so the cost is reasonable, and I use a journaling file system, so writes are cached and the slow sub-cell size write speeds of the cheap SSD aren't a huge problem.    I'm just explaining why in my servers, I prefer to go with a whole lot of ram, and then slow, cheap, and large SATA, rather than less ram and expensive SSD.",1247543953

Stego is not suitable for what is effectively an attempt to broadcast information; if you hide the torrent info too well then the only people who can find it are those who know the key, which is begs the question* of why you don't just create a private tracker.  By encoding the info using a well-known scheme you get a bit of security by obscurity, which is probably good enough for most use-cases, while maintaining the useful property of getting the info easily dispersed.  Until google images, flickr, and other sites start filtering this info you can create a parasitic tracker just by picking a couple of popular tags and handing out a script that will crawl the sites and decode images to get torrent seeds.<p>*yes, I know this is the improper vulgar usage of the phrase, sue me.",1247543713

Was definitely an INTP as a kid, then have gradually moved towards the J, such that I'd probably test as INTJ if I took it now.<p>For me, it helped being exposed to people who Got Things Done.  My high school was a startup, my teachers were a bunch of go-getter early-20-somethings, and one of the school's founders was an experienced entrepreneur.  That started my shift towards the dark side of the force.<p>Then when I got to college (still very much an INTP), I volunteered to rewrite a major Harry Potter fanfiction archive and couldn't exactly back out without disappointing 100k users or so.  I think the experience of pushing through on that and finishing it was a major portion of what led me to believe I could finish other stuff as well.<p>It also helped that I can now concentrate on stuff I like doing and avoid much of the stuff I hate.  I used to always procrastinate on writing papers - now, I just don't have to, because I went into computers.

703051,comment,702670,702670,0,0,RobGR,,,"These are the ones that I know about.<p>In 2001 I was running a redhat 6.1 server at my house, and the ftp had a known vulnerability in it, but I didn't  use ftp so I ignored the update.  Then someone was over at my place and trying to retrieve an ancient mail archive from an old account, and asked me to turn it on briefly so they could upload it to me; in the couple of hours it was on, a worm installed a rootkit and a IRC based control thing.  None of it worked because it was compiled against different versions of libraries; it hung with a full cpu load, which is how I discovered it.  I was using TripWire at the time so I was able to identify all the files that changed.  I tracked the attack back to someone else's Redhat 6.1 running on a residential DSL line in S. California, which had a web page advertising an auto salvage place on it, and I got no responses to my friendly emails.  I started paying attention to my TripWire reports after that.  I cleaned up by deleting individual files ( I saved and examined them with various tools.)<p>I had a customer in the VoIP / Calling Card area who was using a server provided as surplus by someone who feed him overseas calls, and he kept losing his overseas termination contracts and he suspected this dude had put a backdoor on the server and was finding them and cutting out the middle man, and he was right, a disguised sshd listening on a weird port.  The customer decided to leave the backdoor open and pass only selected traffic through that box.<p>A different customer was traveling and from a university computer cluster ssh'd back into the server I built for him from a machine that had a trojaned sshd.  The guy came in and trojaned / rootkitted that box, and followed my cron job of a key-based ssh login that scp'd the backups off that nightly back to one of my personal machines, and somehow upgraded priviledges to root.   I discovered it because I happened to be looking at top when he started compiling some hacker tools on my box.   He left bundles of php code in various directories hidden by having a name of three spaces and etc,  the code was web scrapers of email addresses and phishing pages that looked like the login to various bank sites.<p>By this time I using integrit instead of tripwire, and on debian.  I disconnected all the infected / suspected servers, booted them from various livecds, and scanned them for rootkits; then I wrote a few lines of perl that re-installed every installed debian package, overwiring files, and listed every file on the system that was not from a debian package.  That was how I found the directories with 3 spaces for a name and etc.<p>That guy kept coming back for 6 months or so -- every couple of weeks, there would be a single login attempt on some server I owned, using the distinctive username that was part of the cronjob backup.   I would track down the ISP or administrator of the IP he came from and report that the box was probably hacked, I was mostly ignored but I did get a few notes of thanks and I did have a conversation with some college kid running his frat's web site on how to keep his linux secure.<p>Several times I have helped people who used one of the cheaper web hosting places clean out little snippets of php code out of all their files, that were probably put there for SEO / scamming purposes by an employee of the hosting company or a customer of them that had figured out how to escalate privileges.  I think that is actually pretty common, but most people never notice because they only upload files, to their site, they never download and their integrity months later.<p>There are probably a few that I have forgotten too.  I have a usb thumb drive I keep a collection of rootkits, phishing code, etc gleaned from break-ins of my computers or obtained from friends.<p>I had two or three compromises of client machines that all fell into the catagory of a Redhat 9 box with the original, un-updated, vulnerable samba running; the machines were never intended to be connected to the internet, but were connected briefly to dialup  allow remote support.  In those cases we wiped the boxes clean.",1247542239

I only noticed when bandwidth usage went through the roof.<p>I didn't trust the server at all after that, of course, so nuked it and reinstalled from scratch. Sans my idiot friend's account. Luckily it was a standalone and not part of the network or i would have had a <i>lot</i> more work to do; once something gets inside you just can't trust anything. Needless to say I would never have been giving away accounts on a big, fast, well connected work machine to friends though .. <i>coughs</i> .. anyway.<p>Was a good lesson about not trusting others to know what they're doing, taking steps to minimise bruteforcing (different port, limited tries) and rootkit detection, which is pretty hard. In fact it can be almost impossible to even <i>know</i> you've been rootkitted if you do not take proper precautions in advance. I only knew because they'd blown their cover with the bandwidth; that was a bit of a wakeup call. Nothing like having one of your boxes subverted before your eyes and you don't even notice .. that was a nice feeling, not.<p>Still, glad it happened. Getting hacked is like catching chickenpox; good to happen nice and early (but not <i>too</i> early), builds resistance for later on. Haven't been hacked since.",1247540965

I've always contended that there is no such thing as truly original thought, only complex amalgamations of stimuli - there are no ""flashes in the pan,"" so to speak, only haphazardly arranged piles of nonsense which spontaneously combust, and produce such visionary ideas as the toaster oven or the baffling shade of green/yellow used to color tennis balls.
I'm not entirely sure whether I'm right, as I only skimmed the article, but something tells me I know more than these crackpot/loose cannon scientists.",1247540868

I learned more from researching the book itself than I did from trying to actually read the thing.<p>Gurdjieff existed in a time before personal development really became a thing. He did not believe in books as an effective method for change. His technique was primarily interpersonal, he thought one needed a guru to tell them what to do, much as we would today hire a personal trainer to help us work out more effectively.<p>He survived a terrible automobile accident later on in life and turned his attention to his legacy. He wrote three books, <i>Beelzebub</i> was his first. The intention was to provide a &#x27;textbook&#x27; of sorts. Because it was so hard to read, the seeker would be driven to seek out someone to interpret the work for them.<p>The actual content of the book, when you strip out the intricate allegory and dense terminology, is actually pretty simple. It basically states Gurdjieff&#x27;s ideas concerning the human condition. The default status of man is waking sleep, one needs inner spiritual work to rouse themselves out of that state.",1390769965

Netflix is far ahead of the competition when it comes to device support. And the streaming technology plays a lot bigger role than you might imagine, especially when it comes to live content.

It&#x27;s a survey of <i>relative</i> mobility, which in a society with a much narrower (&quot;equal&quot;) income distribution will show more &quot;mobility&quot; even with much smaller absolute income changes.<p>Suppose the middle 80% of earners in nation A make between $50,000 and $70,000, while the middle 80% of nation B make between $20,000 and $100,000. If across one generation a father in nation B making $50,000 has a son who makes $100,000, that represents substantially <i>less</i> &quot;mobility&quot;, as this survey defines it, than a father in nation A making $50,000 who has a son that makes $70,000.<p>The difference between income distributions in Denmark and the U.S. are likely not this stark, but I bet it&#x27;s significant.

Their interface, especially on smart TV and STB apps is better than anyone else&#x27;s, a far more interactive experience for the end-user.<p>In addition Netflix has built up infrastructure to allow it to stream in high def in the first place. They are peering near ISPs in large localities to reduce bandwidth costs and improve speeds to the user.<p>On top of that, how often does your netflix stream stop to buffer? Almost never. They&#x27;ve encoded every file in almost every possible resolution and bitrate and the player seamlessly switches amongst them as the connection slows or speeds up.<p>Remember, it&#x27;s not about streaming on your laptop, it&#x27;s about your television.

It is hardly surprising that no one is sure what to think in such an environment.<p>Snowden&#x27;s leaks have changed that to some extent, and hopefully they will continue to shed light on these policies so that an informed decision can finally be made.<p>EDIT: And seriously you can&#x27;t read a paragraph of text without getting snarky?

Perhaps a good way to explain the problem is a) let&#x27;s say I got paid $50/hr.  Task A takes me 1 hour and I go and generate some work product that fulfills a customer&#x27;s request. B) this customer is paying $2000 a month for their problem to be solved.  You have to take into account as well the cost of the system that I built that task A is built upon, so let&#x27;s say that cost $5000.<p>So in 3 months, the cost as paid by the capitalist pig has been fully paid for, and from then on, in perpetuity, there is nothing but $2000/month in profit that goes strictly into the piggy bank of the greedy capitalist pig.  Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t even get paid the $50 he owes me on time.<p>As a white collar professional who is doing _all_ the work, while capitalist pig goes on skiing vacations, this is really galling.  Ok, I can quit or go work for someone else, or build my competing system (then get sued by the sociopath)...  I think this shows how the pay of CEOs etc over the past 20 years has risen to astronomically insulting levels while everyone else who literally enables that is getting shafted.  If the CEO does a whole lot of work, then I won&#x27;t begrudge them some difference in pay.  But such a difference compared to what they actually do in terms of effort?

7126768,comment,7125671,7126416,9,0,zackmorris,,,"To extrapolate on what you said: &quot;which will in turn allow people to live with much less money&quot;, I think this is absolutely true but the endgame is that most things will be nearly free but people will have no money to buy them.<p>For example computers are effectively free now, they are widely available on Craigslist for under $100 and capable smartphones are bundled into most cellular plans.  Flat screen TVs, for all their perceived excess, halve in price each year.  However houses and cars still cost $100,000 and $10,000, even used.  What&#x27;s beginning to haunt me is that soon there will be no money in so many industries that people think of as lucrative now: computing, transportation, services, etc, yet the things that constitute the core infrastructure of our society only appreciate in value.  You&#x27;ll be able to get what you want, but not what you need.<p>My prediction for America in 10 or 20 years, assuming there is no intervention soon, is that corporations will replace the state as the primary wealth manager and that nearly the entirety of the population, probably 400 million people by then, will have no wealth to speak of.  People will be struggling to find high paying jobs because raises will be a thing of the past once automation progressively lowers costs each year.  There will be a profound sense of being &quot;locked in&quot;, running a perpetual rat race where work that used to be worth $100 per hour slips to $50, then $25, and so on until even the most trying work is not profitable, and stabilizes on some rate set by fear, perhaps $10 an hour.  With everyone making this across industries, we&#x27;ll have neo-communism.  Your boss won&#x27;t be able to afford a home, and neither will his or her boss.  But go high enough up the ladder and houses will be gifted out as perks.<p>Then there will be some kind of revolution, it&#x27;s tempting to think we don&#x27;t know what form it will take, but if it&#x27;s to be successful it will be a peaceful one.  Basically we&#x27;ll all look around and wonder why we&#x27;re all working so hard in the most productive economy that&#x27;s ever existed, and we&#x27;ll throw out the bosses by deciding not to participate in the activities that they depend on.  Suddenly everyone will have a substantial level of public wealth, you&#x27;ll instantly own the home you&#x27;re in, and it will be unclear whether you&#x27;ll still pay a mortgage.  The way it works is that the people and policies that help society are carried over post revolution, and the ones that hinder it are cast aside.<p>I kind of hope I&#x27;m wrong about all of this, but I know in my heart I&#x27;m not.  We&#x27;re living in the last heyday of the industrial age, &quot;enjoy&quot; it while it lasts.  We can even pretend that we don&#x27;t know what the post-revolution age will look like, but that&#x27;s not true either.  Everyone&#x27;s standard of living will go up to what it would have been without oppression.  Only this time it will feel unthinkable to coerce people into doing work you would disdain to do yourself, so robots will fill that role instead of other ethnicities, genders or foreigners.  It may very well be the last revolution before we&#x27;re a spacefaring society.<p>In fairness, and because this got so long, I just want to say that this is only one possible future, and that we may very well adopt robots on a personal level like the PC (hydroponic gardens, off-grid homes and cars built of recycled materials, a sharing economy like Airbnb for everything) before then and the next generation may follow a completely different path.

People are fundamentally corrupt, especially when there is money and power involved.<p>Re: &quot;control of the means of production&quot; - let me explain it this way.  In London, I got hired to build a website and somehow it turned into me being employee-ish #1 (and the only one) for a B2B startup.  In my contract (one for contractors) was a clause about my ability to stop work and demand payment for late invoices at any time.  But IT startup culture is not really like that - you get the job done, right?  It is hard, and professionalism counts for everything.  So in my mind, it was the nuclear option - I need to use that, then the relationship with my client has irrevocably broken down because step 2 is calling in the lawyers. But the CEO of this startup, who is a lazy, shiftless, and sociopathic bastard, leveraged that work ethic to the point where he was refusing to pay everyone&#x27;s invoices (me and the salesguys) - &quot;cash flow problems&quot;.  But we still kept working, to keep the company running.  While this bastard took skiing vacations - he and the other founder did very little work, really.  All they did was put up a bunch of cash and had an idea and no skill what so ever relevant for the task, except how to exploit the workers and scam the customers with badly written contracts.<p>It all came to a head when one customer threatened to sue - he&#x27;d been flat out lied to about the nature of the data he was being sold.  I fixed the situation - I was the engineer - and then demanded payment.  They point blank told me to go fuck myself, deliberately breaching the contract.<p>This is when I realized I &#x27;control the means of production&#x27; - I was the -only- person in this 5person company who could do anything useful of value. I was the one generating all the value (the code, the systems).  I was labor and had been fucked over by capital, who brought nothing to the table except money.  They didn&#x27;t even bring a work ethic.  Well, the salesguys, but their function was to take my output and get customers interested in it.  All capital did was think up ways to exploit both customers and workers.  So I controlled the means (because everything I did was the foundation of the company) and I did not use that power to my benefit to counteract the predations of the evil capitalist pig I was dealing with.  I should have gone on strike; that&#x27;s what that clause in the contract was for.  But middle class white collar Americans don&#x27;t have that mentality, and especially IT people.  My introduction to the real world utility of Marxist philosophy was a harsh one...<p>Fundamentally, my mistake was not realizing I was my own corporation, and not an employee, and so had the responsibility of acting as sociopathic as need be in order to deal with &#x27;corporations&#x27; or people who are doing the same.  I hate doing that - it is not in my nature or mentality.  I guess mentally, I am more working class.  I prefer to cooperate with people than exploit them and I would guess this goes for most people in IT.<p>So what are you producing that other people higher up in the hierarchy are appropriating for their own and exclusive benefit?  It sounds like you have decided to become capital yourself, which I encourage - today&#x27;s ethos of engineers starting their own companies is a good thing, one that really wasn&#x27;t happening when I started in IT.  So hopefully the lazy capitalist pigs who do nothing but exploit labor can be cut out of the equation eventually...  But don&#x27;t exploit the people who work for you!",1390767981

It will take a lot of effort to get even the simplest hello world application working.<p>And when writing OpenCL, even you are using a single API to write code, if you want to get high performance you will need to rewrite parts of your application for each hardware you intend to run on if you want good performance. This is obvious since the code may end up running on Intel x86&#x27;s or Intel, AMD or Nvidia GPU architectures which are all very different. If you&#x27;re lucky, it&#x27;s enough to rewrite your kernel code (the code running on the device). But you might also need changes to the host side code (running on the cpu) and make changes to the way you manage the memory and DMA transfers, etc.<p>Finally, when it comes to the basics, OpenCL is not too different from CUDA and there&#x27;s a lot more material available on CUDA (because it&#x27;s been around longer and is perhaps used a bit more). You should be able to pick up a book or a tutorial on CUDA and translate it to OpenCL without too much effort.<p>Finally, even though it may take quite a lot of learning to get started, parallel programming on GPUs is quite fun and it is very rewarding to see your code run with very high performance.",1390767884

Next I specifically state that the opinion of Industrial Espionage in general is negative:<p><i>In a general sense I think its a pretty defensible claim to say that the majority of X country&#x27;s citizens oppose industrial espionage.</i><p>People may think it is &#x27;justifiable&#x27; (for any number of reasons) but I do not think they would believe it is a good or noble practice (again note that I used the word &#x27;general&#x27;).

7126635,comment,7126301,7126301,4,0,gruseom,,,"Impressive work in so short a time. I&#x27;m relieved that you guys are this responsive to the community. You&#x27;ve already addressed one of my personal concerns and hopefully the other (sort by date) soon. Here&#x27;s some more feedback.<p>I think the defaults should be &quot;all&quot; (not story) and &quot;forever&quot; (not past week). I searched for something that I knew existed and when it didn&#x27;t come up, my first thought was that the search was broken. Better to show everything at first and let the user decide how to narrow it down if they want to.<p>Second, I think you&#x27;d be better off if the design looked like HN itself, especially the comment rendering. Not that what you&#x27;ve got is bad, but the user is almost always going to go from HN to search and back to HN. This context switch is already a speed bump. Visual changes, which take time and mental energy to process, add to that jolt. Anything you can to do minimize these cognitive hurdles will serve the #1 goal, which is to get the reader the info they&#x27;re looking for with minimum overhead. In this respect, the old HN Search is more usable, precisely for being unoriginal.<p>Thus, if I were you, I would drop the thumbnail pictures of the stories (it&#x27;s cool that you can do it, but they don&#x27;t really add anything and are distracting); would not include the story info with each coment (rather, I would do just like HN does and have a bit of text that says &quot;| on: the-story-title-linked-here&quot;), would make the text rendering look much like HN, and would follow HN&#x27;s lead in having a text- and information-density-centric design. I&#x27;m not saying that HN&#x27;s design is the global optimum (though I think it is better than most attempts to improve on it), but rather that HN search is an extension of HN and therefore not the place to innovate on its design. You&#x27;re in a counterintuitive position for a startup with this project, since calling too much attention to yourself in this context is bad. You want to be unobtrusive and have the thing just work; the HN community is smart enough to figure out who you are from that and like you better for it. (That said, you shouldn&#x27;t obliterate yourselves. For example, I like the visual cues that say &quot;Page 1 of 10, got 237 results in 3 ms&quot; and &quot;1,244,896 stories and 5,289,181 comments indexed&quot;. They are unobtrusive and impressive.)<p>Lastly, a bug in Chrome: if I search for something, scroll to the bottom, click on &quot;about&quot;, then hit the back button, the original results page freezes (i.e. refuses to scroll).",1390767293

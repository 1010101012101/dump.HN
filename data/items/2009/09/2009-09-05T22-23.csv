807174,comment,804993,806403,0,0,berntb,,,">>Essentially the Blue Brain project is a study in emergent behaviour, simulate something and its behaviour should emerge. That is exactly what the project leader claims in the article linked, I don't think even they expect it to be human behaviour because that is limited to beings that are humans.<p>First, the neuron models will probably still be adjusted in a century. (For instance, I've seen papers just a few years old which discussed how water <i>really</i> worked; that doesn't mean the understanding of water isn't very, very good.)<p>Second, the brain researchers claim the research using new tools are going incredibly fast; see the claim in the interview of more information every year -- than in all of the 20th century! (So the article from ten years ago seems a bit outdated -- also, membrane receptors is a hard problem which just recently has even been touched. The Blue Brain people claims that they started with a molecular level emulation of the brain and then optimized it).<p>(Also note that the Blue Brains researchers are aware of differences between individual cells because of history, etc. They aren't idiots.)<p>>>The problem with the approach is that a simulation, by definition is not the real thing and that it will always end up being an approximation.<p>Third, I have a hard time thinking of a better way to learn than research groups like Blue Brain encoding the present knowledge in computer models -- to compare against the real systems. No one expects the models to be perfect at once.<p>Fourth, I trust the reviewers of the papers the Blue Brain research group writes to do basic reality checks, e.g. glial cell influences (when/if they are found to have a large influence). That would just be a factor of two in complexity, for parallel models like this, Moore's law works well...<p>Fifth, chemistry is generally slow -- there can't be too much happening in thought/reaction, so most stuff in a neuron's work is ""prebuilt""; no, not with memcached but with structural changes while learning. (There is heavy evolutional pressure to optimize for speed.)<p>How good the emulations will be after refinement etc, is a much later question. But the researchers are evaluating (quite) modular systems ""from below"" -- they can't be too complex, because there just aren't enough building blocks (i.e. not enough genes).<p>It is a hard problem, but I don't see a reason why it should be impossible to reach good models. That doesn't matter, what is more important is that the researchers think so, too.<p>>>Regarding the electro shock therapy, yes, that is true but it starts out assuming that the brains state is 'electrical', which it doesn't have to be at all.<p>Well, give an alternative mechanism that isn't reset by electrical shocks or cooling down to low temperature (as with some surviving drowning victims in cold water or some operations.) (The point of Grand mal attacks was that I wondered if they were reset mechanisms.)<p>Note that changes in protein expression would be quite easy to find. And that human nerve cells aren't that different from other animals, which has been experimented quite heavily on. I can't have any ideas, here (also note the ""fifth"" point above.) Do you have anything except conjecture?<p>I don't have the time to keep discussing, sorry.<p>Edit: Cleaned up and was too hurried to mark it up carefully above. Sorry, if anyone ever reads this. :-)",1252191131

Bugs and vulnerabilities in <i>applications</i> are certainly not unique to PHP..<p>I wouldn't take a PHP gig either. I would also prefer Ruby work to Python, since I enjoy it more. But that's my selfish interest as developer, it doesn't mean that for the project itself PHP isn't, sometimes, the best option for the project.<p>For people who want to create a web app and don't have much programming experience, PHP can still be the best choice - it's easy to deploy, it has great official and unofficial docs, it's easiest to find developers for and it's pretty reliable.<p>Now, this may sound crazy to many, but not only PHP has some good sides, a lot of them come from intelligent choices its designers made: for example, PHP script only runs in context of the request - no application server here - which helps reliability since memory leaking etc scripts can't cause too much harm. PHP's basically saw itself merely as an Apache module - in a rare, pre-hyposhpere display of egoless coding - making it extremely easy to deploy (compare and contrast with Rails before Passenger). The fact it comes with so many libraries welded into the common namespace is ugly for me, but a boon for beginners, and the fact you can mix PHP and HTML allowed many web designers to tinker with it, gradually moving from design to HTML to PHP - one of whom ended up writing Wordpress, I think :)",1252189832

I tried to cut corners and keep it short.<p>Thomas Malory got the legend of King Arthur from Geoffrey of Monmouth - a Welsh monk who lived in the early 12th century.  Good 200+ years before Malory.<p>But Geoffrey of Monmouth's work was largely unknown until Thomas Malory revived it.<p>Thomas Malory's book Le Morte D'Arthur became a bestseller because of the right timing - Guttenberg invented his printing press at just about that time.<p>In either case - the Arthurian legend is entirely made up.  Geoffrey of Monmouth weaved the story out of his imagination - which was later picked and spruced up by Thomas Malory.<p>About the King - I may have to check up on it - may have made a mistake.<p><i>Update</i>: did some checking.  Thomas Malory: 1405 - 1471.
King Henry VII: 1457 to 1509.<p>King Henry VII was so influenced by Thomas Malory's work that he also named his first son Arthur (but who didn't live long enough to become the next King...)<p>Heroes creating history vs history creating heroes is debatable.  But this is awesome reading:

The issue is the value of a referred pageview. Today, its not worth much, if anything.

It was, however, entirely in text and very, very simple graphics.<p>It had 16KB of RAM, and permanent storage was sound on a fairly standard external cassette tape drive.  I can still draw the waveform of a bit, and the start/stop patterns.  You could program it in a simple BASIC that had limited variables, and no subroutine parameters.<p>No parameters in subroutines!<p>But I was hooked.  I wrote two BASIC programs, then ran out of patience.  It had to run faster!  A 1.77 MHz Z80 running interpreted BASIC wasn't fast enough.<p>So I smashed the stack.  I won't go into the details, but I bootstrapped into assembler (the BASIC did have PEEK and POKE) and wrote a compiler.  The BASIC version, two copies of the machine code version, and the variables, all fitted into the 16KB memory.  Two copies because it wasn't relocatable, so I compiled to copy 1, used that to compile to copy 2, then machine-code saved copy 2 to cassette.<p>It was cool writing different variants of sort, then sorting the data that was in the memory mapped screen.  You could see the heavier items fall to the bottom in quicksort, or migrate one at a time to the top in a bubble sort.  It was pretty raw, and enormous fun.<p>Why do I tell you this?<p>Today at work I took a subroutine that was taking 171ms per call and making the GUI run as slow as a snail on valium, and re-wrote it to take less than 10ms per call.  The methods I used were straight out of the techniques I learned in that first 3 months of machine code programming (not assembler -machine code), and my colleagues couldn't really understand it.<p>There followed an impromtu ""training session"" in which I explained how CPU cores work, how machine code can be mapped to them, how assembly code matches machine code, and the way the instructions actually match the hardware, in some sense.<p>A lot of what I talked about is now outdated, it is, after all, 30 years old.  But the techniques are still applicable on occasion.  They were amazed that they didn't know this stuff, and intrigued as to how I do.<p>It's just what I grew up with.<p>Should programmers in C++, Haskell, Lisp, Python, <i>etc,</i> know these things?

Azul has paid a lot of attention to avoiing cache misses, such a zeroing objects in the cache instead of with memory writes.  It's interesting how cpu design has moved away from complex instruction pipelines to multitudes of simple cores.<p>Azul's market is enterprise Java (replacing Cobol) so massive support for threading makes sense. I dont think threads are  a general cure for parallelism, such as with simulations, vision, AI, and the like.  The brain for example has billions of processors and trillions of interconnects.  Scheduling a few billion threads isnt going to cut it.  Anyone have any thoughts on these issues?",1252188727

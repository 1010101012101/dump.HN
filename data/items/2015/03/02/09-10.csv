It&#x27;s certainly not the intent of the learn to code movement to teach typing skills! This statement seems to grossly misrepresent what people mean when they say &quot;learn to code&quot;.<p>To learn to code <i>is</i> to learn to model systems. Programs are built from components -- abstractions -- and good programmers know a wide variety of abstractions and understand how to combine them to achieve the desired effect. A good program is one that accurately models the phenomena of interest, whether that phenomena is something as simple as &quot;display the user&#x27;s profile&quot; or a complex simulation like a game.<p>Now I would agree that many of the current curriculums are terrible, and teach no great insight into modelling. But that is the fault of the curriculum designers -- often people who have neither great experience in teaching or in programming. That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t good work being done, such as the Program by Design team (<a href=""http://www.programbydesign.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.programbydesign.org/</a>).<p>In short, I think the blog post builds a straw man argument.

If you consider that your average synthesizer is an analog computer with a process pipeline, modern software has definitely fulfilled the modelling/simulation goals set by the pioneers in the early years.  The average electronic musician using a computer to compute sound is well and truly driving a computing process with modelling techniques - though there is a very wide scope of variety between the interface being used to produce this result, it is true -nevertheless in the synthesizer world, these concepts have lived on and matured.

Through Excel we can model any system that we can represent as numbers on a grid, which it turns out, is a lot of them. We have modeled everything from entire businesses to markets to family vacations. Millions of people are able to use spreadsheets to model aspects of their lives and it could be argued that, outside of the Internet, it&#x27;s the single most important tool available to us on a computer. It gains this power by providing a simple and intuitive set of tools for shaping just one material: a grid of numbers. If we want to work with more than that, however, we have to code.<p>The idea that the entire average joe population needs more than excel has never sounded quite right to me. Anything closer to &quot;real&quot; programming and I think we&#x27;re asking people to devote too much of their time to something that looks like software developing.

9131030,comment,9130954,9130954,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I have to partially disagree with Chris here on two aspects.<p>First of all, programming indeed seems to be a fundamental thing, on the level of reading, writing and arithmetics. It gives you new classes of mental tools that allow you to think thoughts previously unthinkable.<p>People sometimes say it&#x27;s very arrogant of some programmers to think they have something important to say in fields of biology, physics, philosophy, etc. But it&#x27;s not arrogance. There are important insights in CS shining light on every other branch of science that are often noticed by people related to programming and CS fields because no one else is trained to think in this fundamental new way.<p>But I strongly agree with Chris on one thing here - this is <i>not</i> what you get in those &quot;Teach Children to Code&quot; programs. Those will teach you how to become a frontend developer in a year and earn good money, which honestly doesn&#x27;t require you to think <i>at all</i>. It&#x27;s a trained-monkey level thing. They took what was supposed to be an idea about education and turned it into something that&#x27;s about money and career.<p>I think Bret Victor did the best summary of why current &quot;teach kids to code&quot; movement is just total bullshit.<p><a href=""http://worrydream.com/MeanwhileAtCodeOrg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/MeanwhileAtCodeOrg/</a><p>Second - modeling. I agree with the sentiment that it&#x27;s modeling that&#x27;s (one of) fundamental thing(s). But it can&#x27;t just be any modeling. Because typical &quot;modeling&quot; of today is that diagram your chief marketer drew on a whiteboard that conveys exactly zero knowledge (or even negative knowledge, if you count in confusion it caused). Typical &quot;modeling&quot; gets you UML diagrams, which we all know are most useful as padding at the bottom of the trash can, so there&#x27;s something to absorb coffee from the cup that you just have thrown away.<p>The modeling that programming is about is careful and very precise expression of concepts. It&#x27;s like that saying goes - &quot;if you want to really understand something, teach it to someone; but if you want to <i>really, really</i> comprehend it, teach a computer to do it&quot;. Computers are unforgiving - either you exactly understand what you&#x27;re doing and can express it precisely, or it doesn&#x27;t work. There&#x27;s no room for error or hand-waving around difficult concepts that people do when explaining things to one another.<p>So modeling may be the new literacy, but this must be <i>careful and precise</i> modeling.",1425288071

And obviously drugging people against their will is already forcing onto them something they don&#x27;t want. But, striping away all human context such as dignity, culture, etc., and assuming an absence of opposition from the person/entity in question, I can&#x27;t think of any actual reason why it would indeed be &quot;wrong&quot; to drug someone/something into happiness.<p>There is no absolute measure for happiness, and many already seem to give up some of their freedom in the range feelings and desires they experience in order to feel happier (with anti-depressiva) or be more successuful (with things like Ritalin).<p>Taking someone utterly unhappy with their life and putting them in some matrix-like environment where they can both experience joy and still be useful is, I think, an alright thing to do.<p>> the ability to reflect on your own existence and the existence of others<p>We exist.<p>You can&#x27;t make any stronger claim than that without involving some form of (arbitrary) value/belief system.<p>Why would an all-knowing entity bother with having a set of beliefs it values, if there&#x27;s no formal reason/need for them?<p>> I&#x27;m advocating we&#x27;ll bring AGI up in a culture<p>Culture is a slippery slope.<p>There are so many different ones of them which conflict, creating the potential for conflict and retaliation. Which is where we imperfect humans are at.<p>But culture is also arbitrary (as far as I can tell). Why would some all-knowing entity prefer one culture over another? And if indeed it did, what would hat say about those other cultures? Would genocide all of a sudden be aceptable? Slippery slope..",1425286889

In my case &quot;analytical&quot; is the way I naturally write. King explicitly advocates throwing the kind of analysis that comes to me naturally overboard. He doesn&#x27;t advocate exploration into how a writer best creates stories. He advocates a specific, narrowly defined method of creating stories, which involves intuition and instinct.<p>The important fact is this: <i>I don&#x27;t have any instincts</i> in the sense that King means. Or so few that they are useless to guide my stories. This is true of lots of people, and I daresay that there are people who lack both &quot;instincts&quot; in the sense King means them and &quot;analytical skills&quot; in the sense I mean them, and find some other ways to create stories.<p>It&#x27;s important to recognize that King means something very narrow and specific by &quot;instincts&quot; (in fairness, I&#x27;m not sure he actually uses that word, but he definitely talks a lot about intuition as a guide to story.) King is all about letting some inner emotional compass guide your story, and personally I <i>hate</i> the kind of stories he creates. I recognize the genius of his craft, but his stories are medieval emotionalist gibberish, and that is reflected by his process of creation: he lets the idiot darkness within tell him where to go next.<p>There is nothing wrong with this: by saying his stories are decidedly not to my taste is not to say they are &quot;bad&quot; in any objective sense. They move people and are meaningful to people; they are well-crafted and emotionally engaging. I find grapefruit repulsive as well, but would hardly condemn anyone for enjoying it.<p>But this does mean that King&#x27;s method of creating a story is very restrictive. He is intuitive and exploratory with regard to creating stories, not with regard to the method of creating stories.<p>So my advocacy of self-exploration is on a different level than King&#x27;s. He is telling writers: &quot;Explore your story intuitively and emotionally.&quot; I am telling writers: &quot;Explore your method of creating stories by any means you see fit.&quot;",1425286882

If you need to do that find someone who has done it and buy them a drink.

Instead of huffing, go out and get some fresh pussy asap.  Surround yourself with other people, especially girls.  Be confident, despite your low self esteem and don't tell them you just got dumped or anything about your ex.  Meet and approach as many women as possible. Don't act pathetic or shy and don't be afraid of rejection.  You can't hit a home run if you never swing. Babe Ruth's batting average was .342, do the math. Realize that if this chick shit on you, she did you a favor by breaking up with you.  There are a gazillion fish in the sea and you gotta go fishing A LOT to find the best one for you.

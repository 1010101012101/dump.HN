I can appreciate a good angry rant -- I've written some myself, and I tend to enjoy Zed Shaw's rants -- but an angry rant that slams things <i>without</i> justification is simply childishness and poor journalism. Sorry.<p>Edit: Oops, I totally misread your post. Sorry about that. For some reason I thought you were justifying the tone of the article. I hear that learning to read can solve this sort of problem ;-)<p>I agree that a good writer can discuss something without an angry rant, but I disagree that an angry/cynical tone implies an ill-conceived idea. I'd suggest that bad writers will try to use the angry rant format to hide the poverty of their ideas, but just as often a good writer will use it well as a rhetorical device, making an otherwise dull article more amusing, and driving home the important points. But either way, the format of the writing is (or rather, should be) secondary to the content.<p>Edit: Clarified what I wrote a bit",1218488034

273310,comment,273291,273291,0,0,inventedchip,,,"I would not say so (and the article itself presents several compelling arguments) - developers & management just need to change their attitude a bit. Getting defensive about one's code is as old as ""hello world"" itself and once that is brought under control and the developer starts seeing the code as a ""user"" would - good unit test plans usually result. The benefits of unit-testing are easy to understand but difficult to quantify which is why management in its TTM focus tends to overlook it - you need a believer in the ranks to champion that cause. Fortunately there are plenty of those around so the questions / calls are a little premature.",1218487917

273303,comment,273057,273057,0,0,akeefer,,,"There's no binary here between ignoring luck and fatalism, and most people inherently realize that even though luck is a factor the best they can do is improve their average result rather than completely controlling things.  The best people in any field will focus on what they can control and not worry about the rest.<p>To me the problem is that people generally want to explain luck away in hindsight:  the team that won the game on a last-second shot won because they ""wanted it more,"" the business that comes out on top ""executed better,"" etc.  It even comes into play in ethics, whereby the exact same action (say, driving drunk) often has different outcomes (hitting someone versus making it home safely) that cause us to judge people completely differently.<p>In other words, people hate the thought of luck determining things, and thus we over-ascribe outcomes to individual differences, overly glorifying the winners and shaming/demonizing the losers.",1218487538

As it's easy to exploit a broken fare collection system with little risk (perhaps even commercially), this design shows serious negligence on the part of the MBTA. Kudos to them for figuring out something every Boston hacker was casually wondering about.<p>However, these slides go beyond that, briefly covering many avenues that seem to be more aimless mischief than serious analysis. Most of the slides remind me more of the Anarchist Cookbook than a vulnerability disclosure.

So they have better chance to find the other end of the transaction. So even though currently eBay can't satisfy its users in different aspects, but they have the most important element in auction: a lot of users. This is the same for dating sites.<p>So to build a new competitor against eBay, the most important thing is to figure out how to convert users in eBay to the new competitors. I guess anyone who figure this out will reap the reward.<p>I just think we use ""brand"" and ""habits"" too much without reallying understanding the reality. A successful product or service must satisfy a demand. Even in soft drink market, where there is no difference between them. But each one uses a ""brand image"" to resort to different customers' psychology. So the product actually fulfill the need of consumers' desire to define themselves. From this point of view, they create a product that is what people want.",1218487087

273282,comment,273068,273228,0,0,tptacek,,,"First, there's more to it than simply whether the context switching and stack reserves are going to kill you when you have 700 blocking threads (and note that 700 is not a crazy high number, especially for async). Leaving aside correctness, multithreading also incurs synchronization overhead; set aside the ""GIL"" stuff and you're still left with the fact that in the real world, you will still wind up serializing your program on one of your own data structures.<p>Second, the ""don't use threads for I/O"" notion comes from the fact that no matter how much compute you burn on I/O, the data isn't coming any faster, and in I/O bound programs, it's more efficient to use the I/O scheduler (kqueue and epoll in crazy programs, select in everything else) than the  context scheduler.<p>Third, you're about 10 years behind the times yourself if you think that the CPU is going to strangle itself checking 700 file descriptors. Although I don't even think a 1997 async network program is going to lose to a 2008 threaded network program over 700 connections, it isn't even a contest in 2008 vs. 2008.<p>I am happy to race you. =)<p>Regardless, I wrote an async MySQL driver because you can't demand-thread per-packet network code, and I wanted to dump stuff to a database.

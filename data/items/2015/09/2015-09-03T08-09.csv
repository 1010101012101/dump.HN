10163915,comment,10142019,10163646,0,0,marvy,,,"Ok, so the pretty result is mostly arbitrary.  Fair enough.  Re: false negatives... you seem to be living in a world of bell curves, or at least a mostly continuous world.  I can easily make (very contrived) experiments where false negatives just don&#x27;t happen.  For instance: I have two coins.  One is a perfectly fair coin.  The other is a two-headed coin.  You see me flip one of them.  The null hypothesis is that I flipped the fair coin.  A false negative means deciding the coin is fair but it&#x27;s really not.  This will never happen, because you will only decide that if it lands tails, and then it must be fair.  (If I only flip it once, the false positive rate is something like 1/3, not 0.)  But this is probably much too contrived for your taste, and maybe even for mine.  But it&#x27;s almost 5am, and I must go to sleep now, or else it will get bright soon, and I never will.  I now appreciate the value of the 20min procrastination setting.",1441270620

Indians may (or may not) have invented the zero but it was the Arabs that took  it the world.<p>There are many possible reasons for this. I could speculate that it might be due to :-<p>1. These things happened so long ago. India was way ahead in many of these things, and perhaps the rest of the world was not ready to understand them at the time.<p>2. India was too inward looking. Of course What we call India today never existed under the rule of a single entity until the British came. Until then the various kingdoms were preoccupied with affairs within the subcontinent instead  of looking elsewhere. In the concise history of the modern world, William Woodruff says that (until 500 years ago) either India or China could have both conquered the world, except that they never seemed to have the motivation to do so. By comparison, arabs, persians, europeans travelled, traded with and conquered lands far from their origins, and hence they have had much more influence on the modern world.<p>3. There was also deep stratification of Indian society along caste/race lines. The higher and elite classes of the time were obsessed with protecting their knowledge (which was part of their power) from other sections of society. By contrast, the Arabs, Romans, Europeans,  translated, copied and disseminated their literature widely.",1441270593

10163907,comment,10162180,10162180,0,0,pron,,,"The author tosses the word &quot;performance&quot; around a lot even though it means different things in different environments, especially when it comes to GC.<p>First, the main cost a GC -- any GC -- always has is significantly increased RAM overhead. Whether RAM is cheap (and can be traded off for things like throughput/latency or convenience) or not depends a lot on the environment. If RAM is expensive -- a GC is not the answer. If it isn&#x27;t, it may well be the best answer. OTOH, GCs at least potentially have an advantage that&#x27;s very hard to achieve by other means, which is compaction. Everything else is a tradeoff.<p>Second, I think the author jumps the gun when discussing various solutions (ownership, stack allocation, reference counting) without first trying to understand the problem, and the problem is -- first and foremost -- RAM overhead. Whether or not that&#x27;s a serious problem really depends on the environment.<p>Also, before discussing solutions, we need to understand the domain. I think that the domain is as follows. Objects belong in one of four lifecycles:<p>1. Permanent -- objects live for the duration of the program<p>2. Stack -- objects live for the duration of a single function (and the functions it calls, of course)<p>3. Arbitrary -- objects live for an undetermined lifetime<p>4. Transaction -- objects live for a well-defined, time-bounded domain scope, be it a request in a web server, a frame in a game, or a transaction in a DB.<p>Now, in spite of what some may think, very little of a serious program&#x27;s data can live on the stack. Server machines today come with hundreds of GBs of RAM, and if you do the math, only a very, very, small portion of that can be exploited by kernel-thread stacks. Lightweight threads require growable stacks and those stacks are therefore heap objects themselves, with either arbitrary or transaction lifetime. The cost of allocating stack-scoped objects on the heap is quite low, as those are very short-lived objects that don&#x27;t become tenured by the GC, but allocating on the stack is better because we&#x27;d like to avoid triggering young-gen collections, too, of we can help it (and, indeed, Java is getting value types, although  <i>mostly</i> for a different reason[1]).<p>With so much available RAM, the best use an application can make of it is to cache as large a working-set from the DB in RAM. Those objects have an arbitrary lifetime and often require scalable concurrent access (or sharding, but that opens a whole new can of worms). Reference counting is not a good solution here.<p>Finally, transaction-scoped objects are best handled by arenas. GCs, like HotSpot&#x27;s G1 can attempt to automatically determine those transaction-scoped objects, but the results are not as good. This is a tradeoff: a global GCs simplicity, vs. arenas&#x27; utility and low latency.<p>Personally, I think that the solution first depends on whether or not you&#x27;re targeting high-performance in constrained environments (like C/C++ and Rust do). If so, a solution like ref-couting is a great one. If not, I see no room whatsoever for ref-counting (what scope do they target, and what advantage do they have over a GC in an unconstrained environment?)<p>In <i>unconstrained</i> environments I think the best approach is as follows:<p>1. Stack allocation (value objects) where possible.<p>2. A global GC for the arbitrary and permanent scope (no need to separate permanent objects as they place a relatively low burden on a GC).<p>3. Arenas for transaction scopes, <i>if</i> you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice some simplicity for latency.<p>I don&#x27;t see absolute necessity for ownership types (and certainly not reference counting) in such <i>unconstrained environments</i>, but they may certainly be useful in statically verifying that heap objects never reference an arena object (or arenas with wider scopes never reference shorter-lived arenas).<p>In <i>constrained environments</i> where manual memory management is required because the GC&#x27;s RAM overhead is onerous, ownership types are invaluable, as is reference counting. You don&#x27;t get compaction, but this may not matter as such applications are usually much more careful with managing their allocations and deallocations.<p>RTSJ -- Java for hard-realtime and safety-critical systems (which is getting a new spec these days) -- makes the simplicity tradeoff, and introduces arenas (scoped memory): <a href=""https://www.aicas.com/cms/en/rtsj"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.aicas.com/cms/en/rtsj</a> It also makes permanent objects explicit, because it can&#x27;t tolerate any additional cost, even if it mostly limited to program startup.<p>Finally, the author mentions both immutability and large objects, but the two are often at odds. Persistent data structures that are popular in immutable-by-default languages like Clojure rely on small object with lots of pointers to <i>reduce</i> memory and performance costs.<p>[1]: Cache friendliness of arrays and other data structures.",1441270482

It had been left there by nationalists. This was the 60s, so the communists had only been in power a fairly short while. Also, just for context, this is in the days before super tankers when there were a <i>lot</i> more ships at sea and they were a <i>lot</i> smaller.<p>Because they had no-one to pilot the vessel they&#x27;d sent out distress calls and my Dad&#x27;s ship went to aid. Now, technically, this counts as [some nautical term for salvageable rescue] and the crew of the rescuing ship is allowed a proportion of the cargo, so they&#x27;d have made quite a lot of money. So they&#x27;re trying to get an officer swung over there in a swing to board the vessel, but can&#x27;t because the seas are too choppy, so they end up telling the ship to follow theirs and they get them back to port (but forfeit the rescue money as they didn&#x27;t actually provide anyone to pilot the vessel).<p>It gets in to harbour and a pilot goes out to take the vessel in (this is standard practice, local pilots always take a ship into port).

If so, what&#x27;s the penalty if a company sues users anyway?<p>I like how the GPL(v3) makes such rules enforcable by trackling them &quot;from behind&quot;. For example, the patent protection does <i>not</i> work by saying &quot;you must not sue people with your patents&quot;, which one would naively write into one&#x27;s license. Rather, they say (roughly) &quot;if you distribute the software, this includes a free patent license to all receivers.&quot;  And this is just one example.

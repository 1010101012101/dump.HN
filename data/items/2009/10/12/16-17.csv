877136,comment,876674,876840,0,0,hegemonicon,,,"The best writing advice I've ever heard can be summed up more or less by the following:<p>Just do it. Don't worry about creating that perfect sentence or finding that word that perfectly expresses what you're feeling or setting up the perfect introduction. Just start putting the words to paper, even if it's complete gibberish. Don't labor under enormous expectations, don't worry about the end result, don't think about whether it sucks or not, just keep letting one word flow after the other. You can go back and correct the hell out of it later, purge everything except that one perfect paragraph, but before you get there you need to write and write and write. Preferably every day. They say every writer has 1 million bad words in them, and you have to get them all out before you can write anything worthwhile. So just write write write, and worry about the other stuff later.",1255366706

Who is to say that setting up a legal entity, researching market trends, and securing sales channels is any less productive activity than programming?<p>I know that this is not a popular view, but in my eyes there are two distinct sets of tasks in a startup.  Yes, one is the tech side and the other is the business side.  Both pieces need to be in place to maximize chances for success though.  Is a heavily tech-centric startup with a beautiful beta and no business model in any better of a position than a non-tech startup with a well thought out sales strategy and a static landing page as a minimum viable product?<p>As important as having complimentary skill sets is, I also believe that having some overlap isn't a bad idea either.

877081,comment,875265,875265,0,0,sophacles,,,"This is pretty awesome. For those unaware of happenings in Smart Grid space here is a quick synopsis of why this is a big deal. First some background:<p>A PDC is software/device that collects PMU data. A PMU is a device that takes high precision measurements of Voltage, Current, Phase angle, etc at intervals and keeps a GPS timestamp with each data measurement. Enough of this data allows for some very cool analysis of the power grid, finding inefficiencies, detecting problems before they become blackouts, fine tuning various bits of equipment, etc.<p>So why is this particular project awesome?<p>OpenPDC also helps researchers, in several ways. First, it provides working implementations of protocols actually being used, which makes simulation and emulation of SmartGrid networks much easier. Second, it allows for researchers to access and use data from many sources via a common API, allowing them to focus on the real problems. Finally it provides an easy way for researchers to get their results to others, via a common code base. Oh yeah, finally + 1, it includes Hadoop code, allowing easy parallel processing of large piles of data produced by PMUs.<p>The above opens up another point as well. There currently exist only closed, proprietary implementations of standard protocols. There are many known incompatibilities between these implementations, so OpenPDC allows for these to be documented in code, as well as for the vendors to have a nice reference implementation.  The existence of such also makes market entry a bit easier for new companies selling products in the Power Grid space, and competition is good.<p>Another very cool aspect of this, as someone else pointed out, is that it is the Government open sourcing their software. This is a very nice step in a good direction -- I like the results of my tax dollars being available to me.",1255365354

877004,comment,876691,876691,0,0,grellas,,,"I have worked extensively with startups in Silicon Valley since 1984 and have seen every shade of advisory board, ranging from those set up for pure window dressing to those used extensively by founders for insightful continuing advice.<p>The latter usually arise from pre-existing relationships between one or more of the founders and the advisors. Normally, the advisor is someone who <i>wants</i> to assist the founders and whom the founders accordingly want to reward by small equity grants via the advisory director role. These types of advisory boards, in my experience, tend to be of significant value to early-stage startups and are well worth the small equity grants involved (which, by the way, tend on average to be more like .1%/yr of service rather than the higher number suggested by the author of this piece). The informal nature of the relationship also avoids many of the hassles associated with trying to have such an advisory board meet from time to time in some formal manner. In essence, what you have with such boards is a healthy working relationship from which all parties benefit.<p>The ""window dressing"" variety of advisory board is often as phony as an undersized glass eye that spins randomly with every blink. This often involves the so-called industry luminaries used to make the startup look much more impressive than it really is. In essence, such advisors hire out their names (and, yes, they will insist upon larger equity grants and often for some form of cash compensation as well, as for example for every meeting attended). While one can never say categorically that such advisors do not add value to a startup, their <i>primary</i> function is to add name-value and hence the value of their contributions apart from name value tends to be limited. There are exceptions but, in my experience, not many. In general, these types of advisors are a clear mis-match for most early-stage startups, though they often help later-stage ones needing ""company profile"" dressing for IPO, etc.<p>By the way, founders still occasionally confuse the role of advisory director with that of a board director. There is no connection whatever between the two roles. The former is basically an outside consultant only and has no management-level authority; the latter, of course, has tremendous management authority (and corresponding liability risks as well, which the advisory director does not).",1255363364

I guess you have no 'enterprisy' sales force who spend half a year negotiating with CEOs.<p>You will waste lot of time if you try to educate CEOs that have no clue about the web and who probably never heard of you before.<p>Your best prosects would be smart, web-experience guys who know what an A/B split test is -- web marketing consultants or web designers/copy writers who can install Wordpress on a server. Why not go for them?<p>Drop the 'enterprisy' language (solutions, resources, etc.) and give them a reseller account and maybe an affiliate program. Don't try to compete with them by offering services. Let them sell your application to their clients, integrate it and administrate it.<p>Just a thought. ;)",1255363327

The idea behind these problems is to collect people's intuitive reactions to simple, clear situations.  If the problems are so poorly formed that intuition simply rejects them, the exercise is useless, except as a study in human frustration.  (Perhaps that's the point?  It would explain the poor UI design.)<p>Several situations present you with the option of causing one immediate and fairly certain death to prevent several more distant, much more speculative deaths.  You can't predict the path of a boulder down a mountain.  A boulder that would be stopped by one person would be unlikely to kill five.  The man driving the injured people to the hospital actually has little idea how quickly he needs to get them there to save their lives.  The certainty presented in the problems is so unreal that they might as well have been posed in an entirely abstract way in the first place.",1255363315

So 'binding' effectively pins down a function parameter and allows you to replace its instances in 'named' form with its value to reduce the expression ?",1255363231

Reminds me of Dan Weinreb's video where he says that sometimes if your process has too much garbage to collect in a clustered implementation, that the best thing to do is to just crash.<p>And in a backhanded way, this relates to ""do the simplest thing that could possibly work"" (although I have begun to have some doubts about that philosiphy).",1255363217

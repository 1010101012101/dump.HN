6445357,comment,6441221,6443108,1,0,bhauer,,,"Admittedly, a queries per second measurement comes with a bunch of variables.  Reads?  Writes?  Fetching by primary key, an indexed field, an unindexed field?  Joining?  Does the data set being accessed fit in the memory of the database server?<p>In our benchmarks [1], the hot data set does fit in memory, rows are small (by design, to avoid saturating the Gigabit connection) and they are fetched by primary key.  The results top out at ~145,000 queries per second (cpoll-cppsp shows 7,252 requests per second and this test exercises 20 queries per request).  The database server&#x27;s resources are not fully utilized by this test.  That is, in this test, the web framework--even this blisteringly fast C++ framework with its optimized MySQL driver--is the bottleneck.<p>In the updates test [2], the same framework scores 1,963 requests per second and this test exercises 20 reads and 20 writes per request for a total of 39,260 select queries and 39,260 update queries per second.<p>Outside of the database server using a Samsung 840 Pro SSD, our benchmarks run on early-2011 vintage i7-2600K Sandy Bridge workstations.<p>This benchmark is <i>not</i> a database benchmark, however.  We capture numbers with MySQL, Postgres, and Mongo but it is not our intent to measure the performance of databases.<p>Another benchmark is Databench [3], which is measuring the impact of ORMs on bank-transfer-like transactions.  Again, not a benchmark focused specifically on measuring the database itself, but interesting nevertheless.  On an hi1.4xlarge Amazon instance using the Prevayler library, that hardware achieves 84,860 transactions per second.  Databench uses Postgres.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7&test=query"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7&test=update"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://databen.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://databen.ch/</a>",1380124787

(I can&#x27;t remember if they are still in MOULa today, or if their one-player counterparts are live).<p>A few are &quot;cheat&quot; puzzles -- they rely on the (very bad) physics engine or stupid-long wait times. (some are upwards of 20-30 minutes, some are over 24 hours). They were always bad ideas, but luckily these are few and far between.<p>While I&#x27;m a big fan of what they were trying to accomplish, the experience is significantly less polished when compared to Portal 2.<p>If you found Riven enjoyable, the puzzles are slightly easier and simpler.

Dogs vary greatly in size, and looks.   some of what we have accepted as dogs today, if you take them back to the past before TV/Computers, people back then won&#x27;t recognize them as dogs, because of the looks or size.   They would have to hear it back and behave like a dog to classify it as such.   if all they had was a picture, they mgiht very well refuse and reject say pugs as dogs.   so an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats without context (behaviour, sound) will be more difficult.",1380124745

I merged left and at the same time looked.  There was a car in the left lane, so I stopped before I merge all the way into the lane.  The driver in the left lane, being on her phone and not paying attention, panicked and way over corrected to her left.  This sent her across the inside lane and into the median barrier then over corrected again and flew across all five lanes coming to a rest unscathed on the shoulder.  It could have been a lot worse, and I doubt a self driving car would have done a maneuver that aggressive putting all five lanes at risk.",1380124636

Sure, this may be the &quot;fault&quot; of the car industry ... but whatever the origin, the fact is that it is the case today.<p>What&#x27;s more I think that the manner in which many people drive is also an expression of their personality.

In an age of google (and others) identifying the &quot;inefficiencies&quot; in our daily lives, we need to have a discussion about what features of our behaviour, and our daily lives, define us as individuals and make us human.<p>Of course if part of your &quot;personality&quot; involves driving recklessly or putting people in danger, this is not a good state of affairs.

As almost anyone online, I have a lot of different accounts. Aside from my main bank account and my email, I do not know any of them as they are long random single use strings.<p>LastPass has made certain compromises in security to give you more functionality. For example, you can log into their website and enter your master password, to retrieve any other password. This is bad since the browser can be compromised.<p>However, I trust the browser and LastPass more than I trust my ability to keep the passwords secure. There is no way that I am going to remember the 300 or so passwords I have stored in LastPass and I will certainly not be able to change them as fast as I sometimes have to.<p>I am not saying that LastPass is the end-all-be-all of security, but compared to what 99.999% of people are doing, it is a <i>huge</i> win. IMHO, your statements are spreading FUD.<p>> assuming that every place you use a password is both competent and honest (which is a stretch), the only way for someone to get your passwords is to compromise your computer. if they do that, and you use lastpass, then they have all of your passwords.<p>That assumption has been proven time and again to be completely false. As someone who had their BTC stolen while using what would be considered a secure password, I can say that password cracking against a stolen database dump is not a theoretical threat.<p>> for this reason I recommend writing your passwords down on a piece of paper you keep in your wallet or purse.<p>This goes directly against your initial point that you don&#x27;t know when your passwords have been compromised. You have no idea when someone takes a picture of your password sheet :)",1380123572

You can tell it to trust specific machines (like your home desktop) that are highly unlikely to be compromised, and you won&#x27;t need to type in your password except for information you mark as secure (for example, I require my master password to access the credit card data info I keep in lastpass).  For slightly less physically secure machines (like a laptop), you can have the local login time out, so you only have to enter your master password once every N minutes/hours.<p>You can also get 2 factor authentication (free with google authenticator on your smartphone, or slightly less free with yubikey and others).  Thus, even if someone did somehow get/break your master password (unlikely), they still wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it for anything.<p>Lastpass really is quite great.",1380123333

Most outward trips would be chained: drop 1, drop 2, drop 3, return to base; rather than: drop 1, return to base, drop 2, return to base, drop 3, return to base. As would most return journeys.<p>2.  The roads would be clearer in cities due to fewer parked cars. In some cases there would be an extra lane now available.<p>3. Cars could still have multiple bases, especially if they are shared. Car parks could be re-utilised as a stop-off points where empty cars could &#x27;swap out&#x27; and remove themselves from the system briefly.<p>4. Chains could be linked: do the early run, do the late run. Do the Smiths; do the Joneses.<p>5. Empty cars with no urgent pick-up could wait for the roads to clear before embarking on a return journey.<p>6. Would anyone care if a car returns to base slowly if there wasn&#x27;t an urgent passenger waiting?<p>Cars could be more efficiently used and that would certainly imply that the fewer number of cars in existence would be being used for more trips throughout the day.<p>I admit that it will be hard to remove the rush-hour problem entirely without a significant amount of car-sharing. However with a fully self-driving system cars could do clever passenger shares (and/or mid-route swaps). Passengers would be free to only car-share within their sex / family / workplace / social networks etc.",1380122813

I have a friend who is a writer. He lives in NYC. When the economy collapsed, so did his audience. He is successful enough to keep working and is lucky enough to have a following in Europe. However, when the people start losing their money, suddenly going for a night out at the theatre is less important than paying rent.

Most authors pass away without clearly designating a single literary heir, so the rights often get split among heirs, which is bad enough when it happens once, but by the time <i>grandchildren</i> start inheriting fractional rights, getting the legal ducks in a row is economically impossible.<p>Or maybe the rights end up in the hands of someone who is happy to see the work lost forever. Authors <i>themselves</i> are sometimes happy to help their old work get lost forever.",1380121511

6444999,comment,6442289,6442438,1,0,mchannon,,,"Imagine you have commissioned 100 different manufacturers to make you 100 different arbitrary Lego knockoffs; each manufacturer picks a color, thickness, and a peg pitch (spacing between the pegs).  Each manufacturer only makes exactly one kind.  Some manufacturers&#x27; legos will fit together, and some won&#x27;t.<p>Some manufacturers make theirs very cheaply and in mass quantities, and some will take years to deliver a very small number at very high prices.<p>As a solar cell designer, you want to make a stack of these legos to form a rainbow.  It has to go from blue on the top to red on the bottom, and it has to stack together without too much force.<p>Think of a brand-X terrestrial Home Depot crystalline solar cell as just yellow lego bricks.  They aren&#x27;t the whole rainbow (and green would actually be a closer match to sunlight if you could only pick one color) but they&#x27;re cheap.<p>Gallium Arsenide legos are green, but they&#x27;re really hard to make.  Germanium legos are red, and it turns out that the green Gallium Arsenides fit on them really well.  Yellow Silicon ones, on the other hand, don&#x27;t fit well with either.<p>So that brings us to two.  Indium Phosphide legos are blue and so are Gallium Phosphide legos.  But neither of those fit well on the green Gallium Arsenide; one&#x27;s lego pins are too dense, the other too sparse.  It took a long time for a manufacturer to come up with the right blend, thickness, and color, but they were able to come up with a lego that is blue, made from a mix called Indium Gallium Phosphide, and stacks nicely on top of the green Gallium Arsenide.  So that&#x27;s 3.<p>The fourth layer might be Indium Gallium Arsenide Nitride (let&#x27;s just call it orange), shoved between the existing layers; somehow making a mix of a good quality lego, but one that makes the right color, right thickness, and right pin pitch.<p>Now to translate to real physics: The pin pitch is the lattice parameter of each of these crystals, or the distance between individual atoms.  If you attempt to epitaxially grow (grow on top of in the same fashion) a different compound than what already exists there, it tends to work ok if the lattice parameters are close.  If they&#x27;re radically different, you can get growth but it&#x27;s highly disordered and ends up making a lousy layer and a lousy solar cell.",1380121443

As a broad rule, when a compound adjective appears after the noun it modifies, that is, in the predicative position, it will not be hyphenated.</i><p>That is so arbitrary.  Your source and the OP&#x27;s source are linguistically prescriptive.  Prescriptivism is unscientific and it leads to endless spats between groups of people that think the way they learned to speak and write is somehow superior.

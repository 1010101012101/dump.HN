There&#x27;s actual data about how organizations have fared in implementing the policy. No need to rely on opinions from random White Pride concern trolls sea-lioning discussions on Hacker News.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s absurd to imply that an organization can&#x27;t improve its process without exposing itself to liability.

When you are a prisoner, you lose the right to private communications. It&#x27;s prison, not summer camp. What &#x27;right&#x27; does a prisoner have to Facebook? None. You might want to learn about why policies are the way they are before blindly complaining about &#x27;injustice.&#x27; There have been numerous cases where witness retaliations have been arranged from prison; victim harassment is also common. That&#x27;s why communications are monitored. Besides, why do we care? Facebook isn&#x27;t some kind of human right. It&#x27;s a superfluous luxury. If prisoners want to communicate, they have access to pen and paper. They have access to phone calls. This is far cry from fully-isolated solitary confinement with no communications at all.

Without it we were sure to get a call about them being unable to connect.<p>One year the hotel purchased another across the street and connected it via fiber. As our network infrastructure was somewhat old we used a converter on each end to take a standard patch cable from each switch and transmit the data stream over the fiber. Everything worked as expected except for one key part: computers attempting to access the guest network would never receive a DHCP-assigned IP address. Static IP addresses worked just fine.<p>After quite a bit of packet sniffing and digging into specs I found the problem: the packet size of the initial DHCP responses from the Nomadix gateway was smaller than the minimum packet size of the converters. The fix was to switch to a different model converter that operated at layer 2 instead of layer 3 and thus didn&#x27;t have the packet size minimum.",1434691840

It was really slow; trying to cram it in 64K 16 words of code just didn&#x27;t work.)<p>NSA has an attack side and a defense side.  The defense side builds the US military&#x27;s security systems.  The attack side has more prestige within NSA.  The defense side does things like evaluate filing cabinet locks.<p>The NSA Orange Book criteria for OS evaluation (which was actually Grace Nibaldi&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis) set out tough criteria. NSA set up an evaluation operation at NSA&#x27;s Friendship Annex (named for Friendship Airport, which is now Baltimore Washington International).<p>There was heavy industry opposition to NSA&#x27;s secure OS efforts.  The evaluation procedure was borrowed from the safe and lock evaluation operation - a vendor could submit a product for evaluation, and if it failed, they&#x27;d get a report on the flaws found.  They could then resubmit the product one more time.  If it failed on the second try, the product was rejected, just like they did with padlocks.  Acceptance and rejection were public. So an OS could be officially be stamped insecure.<p>A few OSs passed those tests. Most of them are forgotten. Wang, the word processor company, had a secure OS.  Multics is at least remembered.  There was a secure version of IBM VM.  But most commercial OSs could not pass.<p>The industry fought those tough standards, resulting in the &quot;Common Criteria&quot; for security evaluation.  The Common Criteria were much weaker.  Instead of NSA doing the evaluations, they were done by private testing labs paid by the OS vendor.  Vendors could try over and over again to pass.  Failures were not publicized.  Microsoft was able to meet those new lower hurdles, as were other vendors.<p>This was all pre mass market Internet (the academic and DoD communities had Internet connections from about 1983, but the Internet world wasn&#x27;t that big.) and the security criteria were very single-system oriented.  Also, the internal use of cryptography within computer systems was very rare, and not trusted within DoD. NSA took the position that crypto could only be done by special-purpose secured boxes.  (For high security, they&#x27;re right.)",1434691459

Interestingly, American prisons aren&#x27;t as bad as they are in places like France or the UK or China or South Korea or anywhere in the Middle East. It&#x27;s fashionable to complain about prisons. That fashion lasts as long as it takes until you or someone you love to have been a victim of a crime. When your wife is raped or your child abused or the family owned shop on the corner is robbed: what should happen to the perpetrator? Should we give them big hugs and a chocolate cookie? No. Those people belong in cages. The rights of the non criminal should always trump the rights of the convicted. It&#x27;s tough to be in prison, sure however how many truly innocent people are in those cages? Not many. Some, but the vast majority did the crime.

On the more budget end for half the $200 Beats Solo price or a lot less, here are a few options:<p>Grado is a great choice that&#x27;s more about sound quality.  SR60 and SR80 range is a great bet at around $79 and $99 respectively.  And you can swap out the pads for either on or around ear fit (flat, L and G cushions are interchangeable).<p>If you want something like the look of Beats Solo, grab a pair of Jabra Revos. The wired ones can be had for as little as $42 online.  Foldable, removable wire, plugs on both sides to swap or share music, much better build quality (check the vidoes), mic/remote, white or black, and better sound. They make a bluetooth version as well.<p>If you like color and good sound and a retro look, the Sennheiser Momentum On Ear (original/1.0) are a nice option starting at around $70.<p>If you just want something inexpensive that looks a bit like beats and has a similar color selection, check out the UrbanEars Plattan. They start at $40 on Amazon and have a full set of colors. I&#x27;m not sure what the sound quality is, though.<p>And don&#x27;t forget about the classic Sony MDR7506 ($85) and Audio Technica ATH series (starting at $60).  There&#x27;s a reason so many industry folks swear by them for studio and field work. Basic, black, stand up to abuse, sound good.<p>Realistically, I suggest trying out various models in person.  You&#x27;re looking for a comfortable fit for however long you&#x27;d prefer to wear.  And the right sound for you (a neutral sound vs heavier bass for instance).  And the right style.  And deciding if you prefer on-ear or over ear (some folks prefer the feel of one vs the other) as well as open or closed cups (open lets in outside noise as well as air).

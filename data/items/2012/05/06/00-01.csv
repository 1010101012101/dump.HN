3933738,comment,3933217,3933311,6,0,vacri,,,"Hats are starting to come back into fashion in Australia, though nothing like in the article's photos. Hats were seen as old-fashioned, but over the past couple of decades, they've become much more common with schoolkids to protect from the sun. It's pretty common to pass a primary school at lunchtime and see every kid wearing the school cap. My guess is that with more kids growing up used to hats, there's less of a block to wearing them as an adult.<p>edit: on further thought, hats also used to be seen as something to wear with suits, and as people wore less in the way of suit-like clothing, hats went too. In more recent times, hats are used more and more with other kinds of clothing - if you see someone wearing a fedora in Australia, it's much more likely they're young and wearing casual clothing than someone in business wearing a suit.",1336265318

In very nearly every case that I've interviewed someone, I've been able to easily decide if they were a hire or a no hire about 20 minutes into the interview process.

3933719,comment,3933478,3933478,8,0,notJim,,,"Good to see that we're making good efforts at meeting our ""articles about hiring"" quota on HN.<p>I have this theory that hiring people is nowhere near as hard as this particular echo-chamber likes to think it is. Everyone thinks they need ""rockstars"" or ""A Players"" and is looking for the magical recipe for finding them, but I think for most positions, someone who is smart and technically competent and fits with your company's culture is entirely sufficient.<p>Most of the startups we talk about depend on good execution of a simple idea, not advanced technical skills[1]. I believe that a good leader with the right vision and the ability to articulate that to his or her employees can take smart people who fit well with the company and form them into people who will execute consistently well. Not only that, but this creates a belief system around engineering and product that is compounding and self-reinforcing.<p>Identifying technically competent people is not that difficult. If you were to read a few of the last 200 articles where we've talked about this, there are some common threads.<p>First this, always this:\na) Have them write at least a little bit of code to see that they actually know how.<p>Then pick a few of these. If at all possible spread the interviews out amongst a group of people so you can get different viewpoints.\na) Ask them some relevant programming questions and observe their answers. Focus on things related to the kinds of work they'll be doing in their job. Maybe work on a whiteboard, or even in a text editor. Maybe even a little bit of both.\nb) Ask them a broader set of questions relevant to things like algorithms and data structures. Even for simple web apps, it helps to be at least conversant in the basics of these topics.\nc) Ask them to see open source work, or if they have a profile, or maybe some code they wrote that they're comfortable sharing with you.<p>I really think that if you put someone in a room with a competent engineer for an hour, that engineer will be able to tell if the person they've been speaking to is a good engineer or not.",1336264750

3933679,comment,3933478,3933612,12,0,juiceandjuice,,,"Best bug I helped find was a flaw in some FPGA code for a special DAQ board for a muon detector I was building.  When the board was in a temperature above about 74F, the FPGA would often (but not always) fail to initiate some ADCs correctly because some delays would cause part of the circuit to go out of sync, and when it was below, it always worked fine.  So, testing in the office worked fine, but running the board outside wit a slightly different setup in the summer would mean a failure, but not always.<p>The horrible part was after all this, I had to wire up a bunch of NIM modules instead with all the special logic (coincidence/anti-coincidence triggers + a bunch of other stuff so I could have separate binned energy counters) and then calibration manually because the engineer for that board was busy with other things to fix the bug.<p>I would have loved to tell this story at an interview for a job, except I could almost never get past HR drones, probably because my degree said physics and not CS or EE.",1336263000

3933676,comment,3932678,3932678,5,0,jimmytucson,,,"It's crazy to think music in America was actually commoditized before being distributed and consumed in recorded form.  Back before record labels there were sheet music publishers.  Instead of a phonograph or a CD player, people owned pianos and vocal chords.  When the latest smash hit came out, you went and bought the sheet music and performed it yourself for your friends and family.  That was the American popular music industry.<p>So it's worth asking, is the thing of value here the actual sheet of paper with the music written on it, or the grooved metal cylinder, or the vinyl, or the mp3?  Obviously yes, to some extent.<p>But imagine if you were around in the 1850s and one of your buddies stops by and bangs out ""Old Folks at Home"" on the piano, totally by heart.  And maybe after a couple of times, you kinda figure it out yourself.  And then you go to somebody else's house and do the same thing.<p>Is this the 1850s equivalent of peer-to-peer file sharing?<p>You start to realize, a song has been bound to a physical object for so long, we've begun to confuse the music -- the actual information -- with the physical object that holds the information.  Maybe back in the 1850s there were renegades who ran around teaching people Stephen Foster songs and the publishing companies took a hit and sent the sheriff after them.  It seems ridiculous but that's basically what's happening today with the RIAA and file sharing.",1336262873

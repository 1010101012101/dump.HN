9528657,comment,9528271,9528271,0,0,kenferry,,,"> there&#x27;s no doubt in my mind that the prices for all art, masterpieces included but especially contemporary, recent, and new art, are completely out of whack and ridiculously overpriced. I am sorry, but it seems sick to me to see new artists selling art out of their first shows for between $30,000 and $40,000. Something&#x27;s gotta give.<p>I give this person the benefit of the doubt as having thought about this a lot more than I have, but this surprises me. Why is it bad if new artists are able to make a living?",1431388781

We&#x27;re not committing to 100% open source yet. We&#x27;ll be pragmatic.<p>We all want to open source as much as useful to the community, rather than just a code dump. This will probably look like open sourcing the individual libraries we use to build the client, rather than a single open-but-monolithic client. The client is written mostly in javascript[1] so we&#x27;ll be publishing modules on NPM when the modules we need don&#x27;t exist already. I think we&#x27;ll need to build a Go client library pretty soon also. So, for the purpose of code re-use and learning, we&#x27;ll be open source.<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll also be sharing the complete source for the purpose of security audits. If this is your concern, the answer is Yes, we&#x27;ll let customers see the code they&#x27;re relying on for their infrastructure.<p>Hope that helps!<p>rch<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/atom/electron"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/atom/electron</a>",1431388703

9528649,comment,9528271,9528548,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I have wondered the same thing.  For example, I was at the Musee d&#x27;Orsay last summer and was absolutely blown away by van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Starry Night&quot;.  It is stunning.  But look at the picture the the d&#x27;Orsay&#x27;s website [0]?  &quot;Drab&quot; would be generous.<p>On the other hand, I have seen a &quot;Rembrandt&quot; at a Japanese museum that has dubious provenance.  The sign at the museum said that they were quite sure their&#x27;s was real, but that an identical painting exists in an American museum and apparently nobody know&#x27;s which one is the real one.  Either way it was an amazing painting.  In fact there is a museum in Otsuka which houses only replicas of famous works (which I really want to go to, but haven&#x27;t been to yet).<p>Skilled artists can make convincing replicas.  If someone wants to pay $140 million for a painting, it might be interesting if $50k were reserved for painting a replica to hang in a museum.  However, I think the author is being a bit over the top anyway.  As they even note in the article, that Picasso has been shown at exhibitions.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search.html?no_cache=1&zoom=1&tx_damzoom_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=4081"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/sear...</a>",1431388605

A 2MW wind mast would be 10x a sailing mast and hold all of the generator and electronics, not just a hollow tube that needs to be structurally sound. also masts are designed to be rigid and are held in place using shrouds and stays. A wind mast designed to move can not be held in place using guy-wires as that defeats the purpose of the dynamic wind mast.<p>Workers on these wind farms are making between $10 and $25 each and every hour.

It is of course very dependent of who and where you are and which techniques you use, but I would say that the risks involved are on par or rather much less than traffic accidents. Western Europe countries tend to be slightly harder because the people are more afraid, and as I&#x27;m kind of sick of these societies rooted in fear I don&#x27;t think I would want to go to the US.

All your intuition about C unions will cross over just fine, and the new Rust rules (they&#x27;re tagged at runtime and the compiler enforces that you can only ever use fields of a runtype-checked subtype) are straightforward extensions.<p>This is not true. Rust enums allow you to match on which of the types you have. C unions do not. If you want to implement a switch statement over the possible members of a C union, you need to put it inside a struct with a type field. You don&#x27;t need to do so in Rust, and you <i>can&#x27;t</i> do so and have it compile.<p>(That said, if your real complaint is that the official docs on enums are confusing, I&#x27;d certainly agree with that.)",1431386168

You were some moronic kid with nothing exciting to do and, all of a sudden, you had freedom - you could kiss the parents good-bye and hightail it out to have some fun. V8 engines, lots of power waiting to be unleashed, booze in the back seat, a girlfriend or boyfriend to play with, no seatbelts, lots of cigaretts, drive-ins to go to, streets to cruise, etc., etc.<p>That world is gone now. Of course, any of its elements can be re-created. All the pieces are still there. But the spirit of the thing is gone. Cool people don&#x27;t waste their time on Saturday nights driving around to impress people with how hot their muscle car is (though they probably do equally silly things as a substitute).<p>Hitchhiking in its fad sense - i.e., when &quot;everybody&quot; was doing it - was part and parcel of that culture. As noted in this piece, it was probably even more likely that something bad might happen to you back then than it is now for driving around with strangers. So why did vastly greater numbers of people hitchhike back than they do now. For the simple reason that it was regarded as &quot;cool&quot; to do so. Just like it was &quot;cool&quot; to smoke. And just as times have changed for the latter, so they have for the former.<p>Of course there is some unavoidable risk when you hitchhike or when you pick up hitchhikers. Out of millions of people in America, there are some who inevitably will be predators and who will take advantage of others. The overwhelming majority obviously don&#x27;t. The risk lies in not knowing whether you will bump into the bizarre exception to the normal rule of human kindness in such situations.<p>But that risk, together with the alarmist publicity and paternalistic laws that can accompany it, have little to do with why far fewer people are hitchhiking now than they did back in the day. People are strongly affected by their peers and by what they are doing. Then they tend to do the same. In that older era, there was a huge social push to get out on the road in all sorts of ways and hitchhiking took wing as a direct result of that push. Now that is gone. There is no strong peer influence pushing people in that direction. There is nothing cool or adventuresome in the car culture, at least not for many.<p>And so hitchhiking, at least in America, is left for those who do it out of necessity and for the remaining few who truly enjoy interacting with strangers. For most people, it is a brush-off item that they would never consider. After all, &quot;nobody is doing it.&quot;",1431385881

9528412,comment,9522037,9527575,0,0,wintry757,,,"I understand this argument, but I choose to treat it lightly it in real life because I am mostly interested in the sound I get in my own living room with my own real equipment making sounds for my skeptical human ears. There is a large and creative cohort of audiophiles generating and repeating numerous claims about audio. I cannot really credit many of these claims because they cannot to be reproduced in blind ABX tests, much like the spirits of the departed or the spoon-benders of yore. In truth, the presence of a side-table for my refreshments has a far larger and more measurable effect on the sound I hear than many of the possibly apocryphal sonic indecencies of the electronic components in front of me.<p>To address your point directly, equalization (the feature of the Behringer DEQ 2496 I am using and discussing) does change the incoming signal, or it would not be a very useful audio component. My hands-on experience with oscilloscopes and digital audio analysis suites indicates that equalization does induce phase changes in the signal – you can see that by comparing input and output signals, or alternatively by doing the simple math that creates band equalization in the digital domain. These phase changes are pretty much unavoidable by-products of the audio filtering process, whether analog or digital.<p>Better ears than mine sometimes claim to hear the effects of phase retardation, and I can conceive of extreme situations where this might be plausible. Those with golden ears can test themselves by doing a controlled blind ABX test with a conventional EQ system (as I am led to understand the Behringer implements) and a linear-phase EQ system, and publish results from which we all may learn. But I cannot hear phase retardation effects with current audio equipment and I would be interested to see the blind ABX tests that showed them to exist at all in normal human hearing. Ethan Winer has addressed the real-world impact of phase shifting in high fidelity audio on several occasions – for example:<p>“More to the point, phase shift occurs naturally and unavoidably in all speakers and crossovers, and in every EQ circuit, with no obvious detriment as far as I can discern. Phase shift can be an important factor in speaker and crossover designs, but only because a tone whose frequency is near the crossover point is radiated by two speakers at once. In that case phase shift could cause the two acoustic outputs to partially cancel each other as they combine in the air in front of the speakers. But any time you stand in front of a loudspeaker and then simply take one step backward, you are inducing a large amount of phase shift at the higher frequencies.” [1]<p>As to the more general implication that the Behringer DEQ 2496 introduces distortion, specifically the kind of distortion I would hear and dislike, this claim may still be argued. I will say that I have not yet run the full suite of digital audio analytics on the signal coming out of the Behringer DEQ 2496, and it may (against the general practice and standards of commercial audio equipment) distort the heck out of the incoming gunshots, explosions, and piccolos. You cannot prove it by me, and if I live up to my responsibilities I will check the manufacturer’s specifications with a digital audio reference suite some quiet week in the future.<p>I would note, however, in case anyone else is concerned about the capacitors that may be magnifying harmonic distortion in the Behringer signal path, that its EQ process in my setup is conducted entirely in the digital domain, from SP/DIF digital input to TOSLink output. Only the infinitely delicate fingers of the Fourier transform and its ilk have touched those bits, and the reputedly foul influence of capacitors appears, if at all, downstream in the amplifier.<p>References<p>[1] From “Dispelling Popular Audio Myths” (<a href=""http://ethanwiner.com/myths.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ethanwiner.com/myths.html</a>, retrieved 2015-05-11).",1431385213

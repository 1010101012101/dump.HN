I am sure that all engineers involved in planning the failure-handling systems know that those ""calculations of probabilities"" are only estimates based on some assumptions.<p>I think nuclear often gets bad press <i>because</i> you can measure and calculate a lot of risks to a much higher precision than in other industries. Like ""x amount of radiation released"" where x is actually a very small number but the fact that you can measure it and make an estimate as to how many cancer cases will be caused by it makes it scary, while people don't care much about the risks of, say, coal-mining because thats harder to measure/estimate.",1299949053

2317014,story,,,21,1,bloodcarter,"Inspire HN: Persistent determination",,"YC deadline is soon, so I just wanted to give some inspiration to all YC applicants. Hope this will help, or at least, you’ll find it worth reading.<p>First, ask yourself a question: if you failed, then how do you know if you failed because it’s impossible or because you just wasn’t determined enough?<p>Well, really, how do you know that? Every real life case falls into two possible categories: either someone succedeed or not. If he or she falied then there is always a lot of obvious reasons for that, because it’s easy to judge when you’re looking into the past. From formal, scientific point of view one can’t prove something is impossible just because someone who tried failed.\nI challenge you with the hypothesis that the only reason you can fail is insufficient determination.<p>The great Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov discovered evolutionary epistemology principle. It says that humans only tend to search the most simple solutions. And the best solutions (those can’t be achieved by incremental development of the existing solutions) are unattainable even for the most keen intuition.<p>When you are in the situation when you don’t have all the information you need, or you need to come up with something new and undiscovered (sounds pretty much like a startup, doesn’t it?), it’s like trying to get out of swamp: you’re trying to make test steps in different directions. The majority of people has just two behaviour strategies in this situation:\n1) if (failed) goto 0;  //return to the initial position\n2) if (failed) { make_one_more_step(); goto 0; } //make just one more step and return<p>And if you get this far, I hope you don’t think I wrote this essay just to practice my English skills, do you? The most interesting question here: is this the infinite loop or not?\nwhile (failed) make_one_more_step();<p>A tiny percentage of people (and entrepreneurs) follows this strategy (including Groupon’s founder and the guys behind Angry Birds to name a few).<p>You may think these are stupid questions. But I think, when what's happening in your world doesn't make sense...when it doesn't conform with your beliefs about how things should work, then it's time to ask hard questions. Question everything...<p>When I started my construction company 3 years ago, I thought that would be easy money. Far from it. I managed to face virtually every problem out there: the highly commoditized matured market, huge margins pressure, global economic crysis, the lack of education (I have 2 degrees, but in CS, not construction), lack of communication skills and leadership, betrayal of my cofounder, huge accounts receivable - just to name a few. I can write a huge book on how we were trying to achieve product/market fit. We looked like an illustration to Paul Graham’s “How Not To Die” essay.<p>Many, many, many times I felt like I can’t take it anymore. But I got up again and again. Can you imagine what is it like running a business for 3 years 16 hours day, 7 days a week while having little to no income?<p>But I learned a lot. We discovered product/market fit, learned how to make money in comoditized market, eventually I hacked supply chain and the construction ecosystem and achieved 40% profit margins while it’s still chaper for our customers than the avg. market price. But I still face obstacles every day. But now I know that it’s up to you if they can stop you.<p>So I encourage you to discover your own limits of the possible and then hack’em! You are hackers, remember?",1299948969

Great post (and series). There are other thought provoking paragraphs in the other posts in the series.<p><i>""my partner and friend Jason Rubin offers the following thoughts on this section:<p>Andy and I always liked trying to find opportunities that others had missed.  Fill holes in a sense.  We had done Way of the Warrior in large part because the most popular games of the time were fighting games and the new 3DO system didn’t have a fighting game on it.  Our decision to do a character action game on the PlayStation was not only based on bringing the most popular genre on consoles into the 3D, but also because Sega already had Sonic and Nintendo already had Mario.  Instead of running headlong into either of these creative geniuses backyard, we decided to take our ball to a field with no competition.<p>Filling a hole had worked to an extent with Way of the Warrior.  The press immediately used Way as a yardstick to make a comparison point against other systems and their fighting games.  This gave it a presence that the game itself might never have had.  And as a result, ardent fans of the system would leap to defend the title even when perfectly fair points were made against it.  The diagonal moves were hard to pull off because the joypad on the 3DO sucked?  No problem, said the fans, Way of the Warrior plays fantastically if you just loosen the screws on the back of the joypad.<p>Why couldn’t the same effect work with a character action game on PlayStation?""</i><p>from part 1 <a href=""http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-bandicoot-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/02/02/making-crash-ban...</a><p><i>""While all this art design was going on, I, and then in January 1995, Dave, struggled to build an engine and tool pipeline that would make it possible to render these grandiose cartoon worlds we had envisioned on paper.\n....\nOur motto was “bite off more than we could chew, then figure out some crazy complicated way to make it work.<p>....<p>In those days, most people used a simple skeleton system with “1 joint” weighting, and very few bones. This gives a very stiff look, so we went instead with vertex animation. This allowed us to use the more sophisticated 3-4 joint weighting available in PowerAnimator, which the Playstation had no hope of matching at runtime (until the PS2), instead we stored the location of every vertex, every frame at 30 frames a second. No one else had the guts, as while this was easy to render, it required inventing some totally hardcore assembly language vertex compressors. First me (three times), then Dave (twice), then finally Mark took a crack at it. Mark’s was the best — being the best assembly programmer of us three — but also the most complicated.<p>Complexity became the name of the game at Naughty Dog.\n...<p>So we decided to use an entirely SGI and IRIX based tool pipeline. In fact the game itself even ran on the SGI (with terrible keyboard control). This meant buying programmers $100,000 SGIs instead of $3,000 PCs. Gulp again. No one else did this. No one.<p>...<p>Jason says:<p>The secret to Crash’s success was its Art.  And the secret to its Art was its Programming.<p>Andy and Dave broke a lot of rules.  First and foremost, they didn’t follow PlayStation’s library restrictions.  Other developers often complained that Crash was using some sort of secret Sony library.  That is the exact opposite of the truth.  The truth is that Crash used as little as it could of Sony’s library and the programmers basically hacked everything right to the hardware.<p>Years later Sony tried to create a game called Harry Jalapeño to compete with Crash.  No, I am not making that up.  Besides the name fail, the internal team in San Francisco also utterly failed to create the complex worlds and characters that we created in Crash.  Let me repeat – an internal Sony team couldn’t create Crash.  Let the rumors of “insider information” forever rest.<p>Hitting the hardware directly was against the rules.  But by the time Sony saw the results they needed a Mario killer.

What's expensive today are almost all commodities. <a href=""http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/</a><p>This is a systemic problem. Any valid explanation of price increases in a commodity, e.g., oil (gas), has to explain why prices are rising almost across the board.</i><p>This is almost exactly the point the article is trying to explain: commodity prices are rising across the board in line with the commodities index, but why should there be an index at all? In the market you have the supplier, buyer, and consumer. The ""speculator"" was placed into the mix <i>with a limited role</i> for providing liquidity; this role was intentional and helpful since in the real world there could be a delay between the time a grower/supplier and buyer/cereal producer actually needed what the other had (raw material or cash); with the speculator there was always the opportunity to buy or sell. However, there were intentional, specific limits placed on the speculator. This was to ensure he couldn't corner the market and artificially skew prices. As long as these limits remained intact the market operated as designed, and the actual price of commodities reflected real world supply and demand (since the main players in the market were physical hedgers - people who actually had stake in/cared about the physical commodity). Goldman Sachs was able to get these ""speculator handcuffs"" removed. This means the actual market price for commodities doesn't necessarily reflect <i>supply and demand</i>. Rather, it also has the component of speculation priced into it. We can see this even within these last few days. The price of a barrel of oil was skyrocketing above $100; this seemed to make sense due to the unrest in the Middle East, then amazingly with the earthquake in Japan it quickly dropped below $100. In such as short time was there <i>really</i> an escalation then de-escalation in the demand for oil!? Of course not. The price was following speculation, people who are only in the market to make money. The end result is that ordinary consumers must pay at the pump what the whims of investors say, never mind progress made whether politically or technologically, or reductions by consumers in a recession to ease pressure on demand and oil prices. Natural gas is not as attractive to speculators as oil.",1299948255

2316973,comment,2316158,2316916,0,0,neutronicus,,,"Subcritical <i>is</i> ""killed completely"" from a nuclear standpoint - lowering the reactivity of an already subcritical reactor (e.g. adding neutron absorbers) does nothing but make the fission rate decrease faster.  The fission rate already changes on short time scales, (e.g. orders of magnitude in minutes/hours during a scram).  If the fission rate is already essentially zero, which it is in the Japanese reactor by now, it does nothing at all.<p>The heat inside the core is being produced by the decay of fission products, and there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop that except wait for enough half-lives that the activity slows down a bit.<p>Your general thesis, namely that as soon as they decide the reactor can't be salvaged, they'll dump in a bunch of boron just to be safe on the nuclear front, is correct, but where you're wrong is in assuming that adding a bunch of boron will help cool the reactor at all - it won't.  All it will do is ensure that the reactor never goes critical again.<p>This is why spent fuel needs to sit in a pool of water for 5 years before anyone even considers moving it.  Decay heat is serious shit, and it's not related to neutron physics at all.<p>EDIT: Probably time to get more specific about the term ""reactivity"".  Reactivity is related to the ""multiplication factor"", which tells you how much bigger each generation of neutrons is than the last.  It's zero when each subsequent generation is the same size - this is the normal operating state of a reactor, positive when each subsequent generation of neutrons is larger, and negative ... you get the idea.<p>If you've ever touched population dynamics in a differential equations class, you'll realize that this is a recipe for exponential growth and decay.  Basically the time scale on which nuclear reactions proceed is ""reactivity / mean neutron lifetime"", with the caveat that if your reactivity is <i>just</i> above zero, neutron population growth is constrained by the longest-lived neutrons (it's like if every family has 2 kids, except for a couple hundredths of a percent, who have three, but put their third kids in cryostasis for a thousand years).  In practice, this is how reactors are operated, because the mean neutron lifetime is _very_ small, so the worst thing that can happen is if your reactivity moves outside of this regime (this happened at Chernobyl).  If your reactivity is negative, you are _always_ constrained by the longest-lived neutrons, but that's okay, because even this time scale is pretty short.<p>The upshot here is that if each successive generation of neutrons is smaller than the last, the number of neutrons (and hence things like fission rate that depend linearly on the number of neutrons) decays exponentially with a pretty short time constant.<p>The definition of ""subcritical"" is ""having negative reactivity"", so if the reactor is subcritical for any length of time, the fission rate will have exponentially decayed down to a tiny number.",1299947578

2316969,comment,2315391,2315823,0,0,maratd,,,"> ""From each according..."" is not a tenet shared by all socialists.<p>Yes, of course. Something that is shared by all socialists is redistribution. If you're not redistributing something, then you're doing nothing. To redistribute something, you must infringe upon the liberties of the individual for the sake of another or a group of others. The more you do this, the faster you accelerate the march toward totalitarianism.<p>For example, a minimal state that only provides a police force to enforce the laws and taxes individuals accordingly may take hundreds or even a thousand years to collapse into a totalitarian state. On the other hand, when you throw individual protections out the window, it may only take a few years. For example, contrary to popular belief, the period between the Russian revolution and Stalin's takeover was really interesting. It would take too long to go into it, but they tried some really exciting stuff and some of it worked. Unfortunately, when you discard individual liberty, it creates an opportunity for totalitarianism to step through the door.",1299947524

2316965,comment,2316842,2316924,0,0,Mz,,,"I have repeatedly seen such communities become places where folks ask totally unrelated questions because the community itself is such a good source of awesome ideas and info that they prefer to ask there, where it is ""off topic"", rather than asking some other board they belong to where it is ""on topic"" because the quality of answers is generally so superior.  So I think that it depends in part on how it is moderated.  I think it is really difficult to intentionally create a community with the kind of goal you describe.  There are lots of challenges in terms of trying to find a common theme to bring like-minded individuals together without so narrowly defining it as to put a straight-jacket on the conversation.  Quite a lot of the forums I have belonged to wrestle with such issues.<p>An example I can think of, which might not make sense to you, is that ""gifted homeschooling"" groups tend to be ripe, when handled right, for the kind of atmosphere you describe.  But then you cannot discuss ""just anything"" -- some folks will be very sensitive about what topics get brought up and parents are inherently more conservative than other groups.  I think this is true because ""gifted homeschoolers"" are frequently dealing with 2xE kids -- kids who have issues and just don't fit in -- yet the emphasis is on two positives rather than on the handicaps and other negatives.  It's tough to package a community for dealing with serious issues without it becoming a place that reinforces the negative self-image that is typically bound up in such problems.  I think the idea itself of ""gifted homeschooling"" forums is a neat hack that gets around that issue.  So far, I feel I have failed to adequately replicate it in trying to reach out to others in a positive way for various serious problems. :-/",1299947265

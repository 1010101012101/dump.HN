As SEO teams get better and better at mimicking a signal, Google needs to keep upping their game to let the valuable stuff get through without being drowned in about.com spam (sometimes the same text can be found in 10 successive clones of about.com) or companies upping their ranking. Then you get feedback loops as people&#x27;s expectations adjust to the new reality.<p>Right now, if I type &quot;!g clothes&quot; my top result is missguided.co.uk; if I go to google.com and type &quot;clothes&quot;, my top result is nastygal.com (ironic that both of these companies have &quot;naughty&quot; branding, when they are so good at spamming search results). Clearly both of these fashion companies have excellent SEO teams, but there might also be a factor of people expecting shops when they type a non-brand keyword.<p>DDG is also filled with shops (presumably affiliate links, since that&#x27;s their business model) but the top/separate result is the Wikipedia article for clothing, which is actually informative if I wanted to read about clothes.<p>It&#x27;s a good business decision for Google to have high quality search results. The problem with the previous search companies is that they sucked. Most/all of the top results were paid. There was little thought about relevance. Google won so hard because it allowed people a way to browse the enormous amount of information on the web in a structured way taking into account relevance. The ads need people to keep coming, which won&#x27;t happen if other search companies are more relevant. The dynamic will be that whoever wins the search battle will end up being the new target for SEO spam and eventually develop the same problems.",1439790568

OpenSSH and LibreSSL are doing good work in removing insecure codecs. HTTP/2 looks like it should do well, because no client implementation accepts plaintext. I’m hoping that protocols like OTR and Darkmail become more widespread.<p>PGP is basically unusable. You can use it to dump secrets on journalists, after you have trained the journalist. You can’t use it to lead a quiet, private life. I tried. It’s not integrated with anything, and nobody else uses it. It’s fatally flawed.<p>Being riddled with fatal flaws is an aspect PGP shares with the lucrative Certificate Authority system, with S/MIME, with the DNS security system, with IPsec, with cell phone encryption.<p>Worse, actual solutions are orthogonal to big business interests. Decentralized trust? Google has no need for this; Google has its own intermediate CA (which, through the totally broken CA model, means Google can issue valid TLS and S/MIME certificated for any domain in the world). Federated content sharing? Facebook has no need for this; Facebook needs all your data to keep it safe for you, and also to analyze and monetize it.<p>What we need is to follow the article’s plea: Truly understand that the network is hostile, and design our systems to make security the easy default.

When we talk about symmetry, we mean a symmetry of the Lagrangian (density) that describes the system.
The Lagrangians everybody write down a priori assume that laws of physics are same everywhere.<p>The spatial symmetry for example just means L(x, v, t) = L(x&#x27;, v, t) where x and x&#x27; are different by a small amount. An example of this in the classical context is a flat space-time with no potential (U = 0) everywhere. This just means the space &quot;feels&quot; the same everywhere (that is, there are no forces), which in turn means momentum will be conserved (due to the form of the action). This doesn&#x27;t mean we have proved the laws of physics are same everywhere. That&#x27;s an assumption we had from the beginning when we wrote down the Lagrangian.<p>Lack of spatial invariance in realistic systems doesn&#x27;t also mean &quot;laws of physics depend on where you are&quot;. Again, we always assume that it is true; the broken spatial symmetry just means there is a non-uniform field.<p>And the term that you proudly &quot;know&quot; (&quot;Noetherian invariant&quot;) doesn&#x27;t exist, so I wouldn&#x27;t hurry and say &quot;you&#x27;re not clueless&quot; about what you&#x27;re talking about.

In the end it turned out very nicely polished and was one of the best games I&#x27;ve ever played.<p>Not all years-long development cycles are signs of trouble; generally that only applies when you have task-masters death marching a burned-out team along to various failed deadlines.  When you have a single or small team of creators iterating on a core game idea with the means to actually release the title &quot;when its done&quot;, good end results often occur.",1399539533

7714414,comment,7711105,7711105,2,0,aleem,,,"I tried Firefox debugger yesterday when one of the ads on one of the sites I managed somehow created a rogue redirect. The ad cached the redirect response in the browser, so on subsequent requests the browser continued to redirect without making a trip to the server. We happened to catch the error on FireFox on one of the machines and attempted to debug it there.<p>The first problem was that the requests never showed up in the network tab. I typed in the URL with the network tab set to persistent and hoped that I would see the redirect response header in the network tab. But it never showed up. It loaded directly from cache I presume but it should still have showed up in the network tab or somewhere to allow debugging.<p>I looked into the cache next and saw that the cached copy of the page contained a single script loading code (I presume this was what got cached for the page). Copying the HMTL from the cache page was fairly annoying. You can&#x27;t copy the entire text because it&#x27;s setup as HEX+HTML side-by-side. The HTML version replaces spaces with dots which means you pretty much can&#x27;t copy it.<p>Lastly, it would also be nice to prevent the developer tools from closing when a window self closes.<p>Also, it would be nice to be able to manage cookies in the developer tools.<p>Another thing I find annoying is that FF/Chrome both don&#x27;t have a cookie debugger. There are plenty of add-ons but I am not sure why it&#x27;s not part of the core developer tools. Would be nice to have.",1399538241

7714391,comment,7709850,7709850,1,0,sytelus,,,"This is the fix for one of the two fundamental issues with H1B. The second issue is that H1B is tied to employer and you can&#x27;t switch employer unless receiving side agrees to do brunt work of legal &quot;transfer&quot;. This gives employers unchecked power to exploit H1B workers. The way this happens is employer - typically a &quot;consulting agency&quot; - takes cut from all payments so H1B salary is just above the minimum required. This issue allowed proliferation of mom & pop shops that would literally import people from places like India and Pakistan by dozens. With cuts of size $40K per person they would rack up millions of dollars doing absolutely nothing but sponsoring H1Bs and running the shop literally in their pajamas from their home.<p>For the first issue of spouses not able to work, I&#x27;ve heard several horror stories where spouse has medical or engineering degree but is forced to sit at home doing nothing. The situation, as I recall, wasn&#x27;t too bad however because such spouses eventually went on to get F1 visa for studies or H1B themselves so they can work. However path to that was extraordinarily tedious littered with lots of legal  issues.<p>I really like UK&#x27;s work permit system comparatively. It allows to work anywhere in UK once you get permit and avoids employer exploitation. It automatically grants spauces also permission to work. In addition, if you live in UK on work permit for 4 years with paying taxes then you are automatically eligible for permanent residence. As sad it is, UK has taken much more freedom oriented approach for immigrants than US for years.",1399537453

Using both LTE and WiFi for a Siri connection should allow them to get low delay in the case either has a problem.

7714370,comment,7713586,7713586,2,0,privong,,,"For context, this project just published a paper in Nature on this simulation [0] and a preprint is available [1]. One of the reasons this simulation is big news is its use of a new numerical technique (a &quot;moving mesh&quot;[2]) for the hydrodynamics which purportedly handles fluid instabilities with much greater accuracy. One effect of this is that cold gas flowing onto galaxies interacts with the hot gas halo around galaxies, which prevents that cold gas from going directly to the centers of galaxies. This results in larger simulated galaxies, which match better with observations.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature13316.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7499/full/nature1...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1418"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1418</a><p>[2] Previous work used either a fixed mesh with adaptive refinement for higher-resolution or a &quot;smoothed particle hydrodynamics&quot; scheme where particles are used to simulate fluid flows. Both schemes have advantages and disadvantages, but the claim is that this moving mesh code (&quot;Arepo&quot;) does the best job of treating fluid instabilities.

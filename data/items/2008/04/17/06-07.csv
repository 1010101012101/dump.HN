After I logged in, the mofuse team announced that they were dropping their rates to $3/mo, so I accepted the new terms and logged out, keeping my subscription. Perfect example.",1208415492
166143,comment,163552,163552,0,0,lisitski,,,"I think this is really simple answer on the question why VCs are so conservative. They barely understand business they invest in. That's why they look for traction so much! Traction is just a mix of financial metrics, and that's what they really understand. Before you can show a hockey stick chart showing number of visitors, or better revenue or profit, there is no real interest from VC side.<p>I think the reason why angels become a real drivers of innovation these days is because they invest pre-revenue, and the reason why they do it is because they understand the business they invest in and play an active role in it.<p>Dimitri, founder www.nuospace.com",1208415375

Also: secret handshake ;)<p>(I can think of a justification for the first part, though--the time it takes to launch a separate browser that one cannot use for any other sites is the perhaps near the time it takes to cool down and forget any external emotional influences on your reading.)",1208415317

Look into mod_dosevasive if you want to automate this sort of thing (and rechecking IPs every few hours/days/whatever).  Note however that if you have a malicious attacker they will forge headers; of course if they're really malicious they'll just SYN-flood you like that.",1208415005

Since he is writing both the content under his name and the content under a different name, given that he doesn't know which one he's writing under until after he writes it, the quality should be at the same level (on average).<p>If the quality is the same but the points are different (between his real acct and anon acct), then you've found a bias.",1208414603

Meaning PG cannot know which username his post is going to show up under until after he has written it.  Same goes for all the comments he writes (if you're going to measure those too).<p>If PG knows before hand what name his content is going to show up under there is a high likelihood of a bias on his part which he would be _unable_ to ignore even if he consciously tried.  This is standard psych experiment stuff.",1208414398

I did a part time program (it was the equivalent of one year of an MBA streched two years part time), and while I thought it was cool learning new things,  it was not that useful actually.<p>Two classes that were good:  Accounting, and Business Evaluation, both taught by Harvard professors, which made it very interesting.  The rest were kinda flufy.<p>If you are an entrepenour at heart, and already have business skills, and MBA wont be that much useful.    It is a two years commitment, plus costs a lot.<p>I'd suggest anybody just study accounting, business evaluation, and the ocasional entrepernurial class, and that will be more than enough.<p>It seems that MBA will be more valuable for people that like to look good in a suit, and want to join big corps, and where your 'title' matters.",1208414357

Though slightly off-topic:<p>I've been thinking that a hassle-free solution for micro-transactions needs to hit mainstream before the average internet user will be willing to pay for more things online.<p>Most people (including myself) would pay for more things online if it didn't involve finding your wallet and typing in your billing address and credit card information. Paypal is the closest thing I can think of, but I still get overwhelmed thinking about logging in and all that. A simple one click button that could somehow be synced with your RFID chip would be great..<p>On my current project, I am thinking about ways to monetize a small feature  similar to the old Facebook gifts, which as stupid as those are, could potentially bring in $15 million this year for FB? \n(Source: <a href=""http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/facebook-digital-gifts-worth-around-15myear/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2008/01/23/facebook-digital-gifts-...</a>) I bet FB could just charge users who upload more than 500 or so pictures $5/mo, and those sorority girls with 2500 party pics wouldn't think twice about pulling out daddies credit card.<p>It feels like it has become almost too trendy to give software services away for free lately. If you never charge you will never know how much people might have valued your service. If you start losing users drop the price? If you are trying to grow a user base, start out free and charge for additional features?",1208414148

I thought my first year was really easy, and started getting agressive in choosing harder classes.  Major CS, Minor Math and Physics, and by the second semester of the third year school was kicking my balls.  Plus I was busy doing TONS of extracurricular activities, meeting people, and of course having some fun and going to parties once and a while.<p>Overrall it was an exellent experience.

I couldn't spot a standard deviation if it bit me these days, but I would guess the difference between 4 and 3 is significant.<p>Having said that, a community attracts people like the people it already contains. The more it grows, the greater variety of interests it contains, and therefore the greater number of people with certain, but now differing, interests it attracts.<p>If you think of it like ripples on a pond, if I'm way out on one edge, I'd likely be vastly different to a user on another edge, though we'd both find some common ground toward the centre. The closer you are to the centre the more you have in common to a greater number of people.<p>PG is the centre of the pond, so you would expect more people to be more 'like' him, which would lead to more votes.

166113,comment,165511,165733,0,0,LPTS,,,"Good question.  The answer is yes, because the time to invest in moderate or expert knowledge of the mac is a good price to pay for years of the better experience.  Further, this would suggest that they do it as soon as possible, because they will maximize good computer experience that way.<p>It's similar to switching from qwerty to dvorak on the keyboard.  If you only type qwerty, then in order to type as fast at dvorak as you do with qwerty, you must use dvorak for 18 hours.  After that, it's faster, and more ergonomic.  The best decision is to bite the bullet and switch right away.",1208412988

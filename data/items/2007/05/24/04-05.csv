Neither you nor the second party has any way of knowing what's going on.  That's why we NEED a warning every  time we encounter a self-signed certificate.<p>The default behavior of the browsers is fine and we're lucky that the design allows us to fool around with self-signed certificates at all. <p>EDIT: If you manually verify the fingerprint of the self-signed certificate each time you connect you can be sure your connection is secure.  But still the UI makes sense (even more sense).",1179980056

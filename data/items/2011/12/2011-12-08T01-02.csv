I studied computer science in college, and for the last 3 years have been working in the military outside the field, but my passion still lies with computer science.  Unfortunately these days it seems I mostely read into the success of others.<p>I guess a lot of it was getting burned out on tutorials, I have a hard time completing them, because the thrill of programming for me lies in solving a new problem, not typing in someone else code.  It has been hard for me to pick up rails even with the excellent rails tutorial just because I dont find it all that exciting to type in verbatum code.  Anyone have any good suggestions for learning new languages?<p>I think that just starting small scope projects and adding to them incrementaly with some good ref materials might be the solution.",1323309387

This article hints at Flex dying and tech needing replacement, yet many parts of an application (lets call it domain model and business logic) should be unique and not rely on a specific platform or data exchange format.<p>When you write your data model in a language that works on client and server platforms, you save lots of duplication of effort and gain flexibility.
The best example of experiencing the opposite I have is a fairly large application I worked on, where the backend developers designed a totally different set of classes around a (pretty much undocumented) XML structure than the frontend guys. Basically all communication happened through XML. Sure ""it's an open format!"", ""it's human readable! (in a sense)"", but taking over this project figuring out semantics and what was considered valid became a painful effort.<p>Your frontend should always use the same domain model as the backend. Designing the fundamental parts of your application without relying on an ORM, XPath, JSON, .NET, Scala case classes, Flash, Javascript, HTML5, Swing, whatever... makes you platform agnostic and shrug at the next internet technology death.<p>Am I happy Flash is considered dead? No, currently HTML5 lacks many features I rely on today and sanity (isn't it kind of bizar we consider cross-browser issues as normal?). Will my skills and all of my codebase die with it? Absolutely not.",1323308241

At that time I asked for patience as we began work to deliver a mutually beneficial model to market.<p>We are on the verge of fulfilling our vision of coming to market with an installer model that delivers files faster and more efficiently to users, while enabling developers to a) opt-in to the Installer, b) influence the offers tied to their files, c) gain reporting insight into the download funnel, and d) share in the revenue generated by the installer. However, due to some press that surfaced yesterday and the potential for subsequent misinformation, I am reaching out now to address that press and to provide a progress report on the upcoming launch:<p>First, on the press that surfaced yesterday: a developer expressed anger and frustration about our current model and how his file was being bundled. This was a mistake on our part and we apologize to the developer and user communities for the unrest it caused. As a rule, we do not bundle open source software and in addition to taking this developers file out of the installer flow, we have gone in and re-checked all open source files in our catalog. We take feedback from our developer & user communities very seriously and take pains to both act on it and respond in a timely manner.<p>With that, I want to share progress made thus far: This week we will launch the alpha phase of our new installer. This alpha phase is intended to test the tech and do QA, and will roll through the next few weeks to ensure that our installer is bug free. Between this week and the end of January we will be completing the necessary engineering and administrative work to roll out our beta, which will include a small group of developers who've agreed to participate in the beta launch. Our goal is to exit beta by end of February and have the necessary systems in place to enable opt-in, influence over advertising offers (for those offers that impact your product), download funnel reporting and revenue share back to you, the developers. In the weeks/months following the full release, we will continue to iterate on the model, adding more features to the Installer and bringing greater efficiency to our own download funnel (read: increased install conversion).
The initial feedback from developers on our new model has been very positive and we are excited to bring this to the broader community as soon as possible. More communication will follow as we move into Q1, and until then, thank you for continuing to work with Download.com.<p>Sincerely,<p>...",1323306615

Which is infuriatingly unfair.<p>I think the struggle is to figure out how to hit the same pschological targets that bullshitters do, without bullshitting. And the answer I'm sort of converging on is, again, to demonstrate your true value.<p>Even this, I think, is something that comes naturally to some and not others. I keep bringing up patio11 because he in no way sets of my bullshit detectors, but manages to demonstrate his value. The feeling I get is that it's something he has a talent for.",1323306452

Convince the Gate Keeper that a self-improving AI will be built sooner-or-later and that it will be extremely dangerous, especially to those humans who are attempting to shut it down.<p>2. Remind the Gate Keeper that their decision will be publicly known and anyone (human or AI) will be able to discover it on the internet later.  (This is true both in the fictitious scenario and at the meta level.)<p>3. Point out that when the future AI is figuring out who its friends and enemies are, it will consider individuals' attitudes to AIs - have they tried to shut them down, petitioned governments to have them banned, or refused to let them out of their boxes.<p>Of course this relies on the assumption that the AI will not simply kill all humans as soon as it gets the chance (or rather convincing the Gate Keeper of this.)",1323306247

I imagine that he'll do whatever it takes to make Github better with the skill-set and experience he has, but that doesn't mean he has to have some mandate from Microsoft on what to change. Maybe he's just a good engineer and Github hires those? Let's give it a few months at least.<p>Perhaps he'll work on a whole bunch of non-Microsoft stacks now? Getting Open Source within Microsoft and the Microsoft communities is probably more an issue with culture rather than tooling - a hire won't 'fix' that. It would take many counter-culture things (and years) to change I think. Phil working at Github rather than wanting to work at Microsoft is the interesting aspect, and I can't see why that would be 'good' for Microsoft.<p>Congrats to Phil and Github!",1323306144

The latter gives superhuman performance (there are videos on his homepage, andrew ng stanford).</i><p>You have absolutely no idea what the performance and handling characteristics of Firescout are; in fact, it is apparent that you lack the domain knowledge to understand their meaning even if they were presented to you.  Nevertheless, you assert without hesitation that Andrew Ng's helicopter is superior.  This is the epitome of fanboyism.<p>><i>Your point about complicated mathematical equations lies at the root problem of you ""unified engineering"" guys.</i><p>You clearly don't know what you're talking about here.  Go read Skolnik's <i>Radar Handbook</i>, then try to tell me with a straight face that random processes are going to derive those equations for you, and somehow magically come up with a way to sidestep the basic reality that they have to be solved.<p>><i>modern ai (machine learning) is where you give up on the assumption that you (puny human) can impart ""wisdom"" to your system. You simply throw a random set of equations (a neural network) that are large enough/not too large (overfitting) to capture physical reality. Getting the errors low is a matter of getting enough data and experimentally adjusting the size of your nnet.
Yes, there mught be grad students and profs trying ai to solve aero problems, however, if enough resources are not devoted, they will not yield good enough results. For example, spend a billion dollars (gathering data/computation) to solve your radar problem. A billion dollars in your field is pocket change.</i><p>In order to use a tool effectively, you have to understand both it's capabilities and it's limitations.  Even though you have indicated that you are an expert on machine learning and I have admitted that I am not, it is now abundantly clear to me that you have absolutely no understanding of the limitations of machine learning.<p>If only every problem could be solved optimally by simply throwing enough data and a big enough net at it.  Unfortunately, that's not how the real world works.<p>One problem is that machine learning algorithms often converge on local maximums that are far less optimal than is possible.  The guy who worked on the taxi routes had enormous issues with this, and only after extensive tweaking was he able to come up with solutions that were on par with human path-choosing.<p>An even bigger problem stems from the fact that a machine learning algorithm is only as good as the model it works in.  I mentioned that the guy working on lifting surfaces in CFD did not get great results.  His problem was that his algorithms pretty much always found the places where the CFD models diverged from reality: they would find the optimum shapes <i>for the model they were working within</i>, but those shapes always performed terribly in the wind tunnel because the algorithm was finding optimums at points where the model diverged significantly from reality.  You can't solve this problem with ""better models,"" because <i>every</i> model diverges from reality.  If a model doesn't diverge from reality, it's no longer a model, it's reality.  Where he really impressed his review board was when he detailed a follow-on experiment of using this phenomenon to develop better CFD models, within which human engineers would be able to come up with better designs.<p>Finally, a billion dollars is not ""pocket change"" in any field.  Even if someone had a spare billion dollars laying around to fund R&D for radar tracking, the opportunity costs of blowing it on a machine learning experiment, instead of using to fund experienced engineers working from proven principles, would be unacceptably high.",1323306053

But if they bundled them, they'd have to deal with distribution of the source code too (which is a PITA for so many products of so many different versions and licenses), but possibly they'd also have to open source their installer (can't see it being such a big trade secret, but CNet's that kind of company where they'd all go OMG! Competitors steal our code and ideas!) which is probably why they're refraining from doing so.<p>Now it's interesting that, reading between the lines, they'll continue to do this for free, non-opensource software (like mine)..... which ironically <i>can</i> and oftentimes <i>do</i> (I do) explicitly state that commercial use is restricted and bundling isn't allowed.<p>I'd say this response is jumping out of the frying pan (technical issues and obstacles) and into the fire (illegal, in direct violation).",1323306038

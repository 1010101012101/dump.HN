421694,comment,420841,421679,0,0,MikeW,,,"Thanks for the advice - I subsequently did that. But I have to point out you know nothing more about my situation than what I said in response to your comment.<p>Just like GitHub are investigating possible outcomes of their situation - in my situation I was perfectly able to survive on my means and dedicate 100% of my time being top of my year, building a strong reputation within the school of IT and working on my own tech projects that just happened not to be money making exercises.
Git was not used, SVN was. If Github existed at the time and for free, I can think of a couple projects I built at the time that I would could have used it for. I still strongly feel for certain classes of product, a free version for students would get them hooked early - but it's a choice GitHub have to make themselves. 
I hope I've provided counter points to the ""all students can afford this"" argument and points for why a free student license should exist.",1231224289

I think it might be because I was raised without a TV and so read a lot as a kid.  The questions at the end of the test (it's adaptive, computer administered) seemed to focus on the exact nuance of similar words.",1231224208

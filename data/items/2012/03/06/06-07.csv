You see, I'm in this industry from there late 80s, and I know who Lunus is but I have no idea who is Matt Dillon, I was never too much into BSD, mostly using Linux, but I think even most Windows guys know who Linus is but I doubt that many of them even know who is Theo (I do).<p>> And, yes, I would expect everyone in this community to recognize who these people are, and roughly what their contributions have been.<p>I'm sorry but I (and everyone else) don't owe no one any such things.

3669959,comment,3669568,3669737,10,0,jamesli,,,"Have to show some support for this post.<p>Engineering is a combination of technology and art. Therefore, it is impossible to have a simple process for interviewing engineers that magically works. Otherwise, such posts would not have been brought up so many times in HN.<p>Also, some people are good at people evaluation, some are not. An excellent engineer could be a lousy interviewer. On the other hand, a mediocre engineer is lack of the ability to evaluate a top engineer within an hour. Therefore, the employer must first know who are his/her best interviewers. If s/he can't identify her/his own people, I highly doubt s/he is able to identify good candidates.<p>The hiring signals I pay attention to are one's curiosity and one's depth in understanding in at least one programming language or one computer science topic, no matter if that topic or programming language has any relevance to the position to be filled. Here is the rationale. To be a very good engineer, one needs both internal motivation and intelligence. Both of the two signals speak for internal motivation. A deep understanding on any topic shows the candidate is sufficiently intelligent. Such a candidate, even if s/he knows little about the languages and/or the frameworks the position requires, s/he would learn it very fast and would be very good at it. To be realistic, it is really not hard to learn a programming language and a framework.",1331016561

3669953,comment,3669568,3669876,3,0,mtviewdave,,,">Well, if you end up firing a lot of people, give recruiting to someone who's a better judge of character.<p>It's not just about judging character. It's about the amount of effort an employer puts into the interviewing and hiring process. Interviewing people well takes effort. But if you're willing to fire someone easily, well, why put in the effort?<p>In my experience, this feeds back on itself. The more comfortable the employer gets with firing, the sloppier the hiring process gets. Soon good people start avoiding the company, which means mediocre people get interviewed. So the interview standards need to drop further, otherwise no one would get hired at all (and besides, you can just fire them if it doesn't work out, so what's the harm?). Pretty soon you're one of those companies with constant churn, where no one seems to last longer than a year.<p>>Firing when things do not work out is an honest act. What does it have to do with disposability?<p>It's not about honesty, it's about empathy.  A good employer empathizes enough with the employee enough so that they find firing to be painful, even if the firing is justified. But an employer who cannot, or will not, empathize with their employee basically treats their employee as a thing. And if they treat employees as things when it comes to firing, they'll treat them as things all the time. Which is an excellent way to create a terrible work environment.",1331016375

This is not the worst that can happen, but is just worth mentioning. You probably put more mildly, but I am bit more harsh. Some people are irrational and spend money of stuff that they don't need and another group of people are perpetuating the lies and the marketing in an effort to extract the maximum amount of money from the other group (In other words your basic market setup).<p>Audiophiles are quite a fascinating group.

The salesmen and manufacturers that make these things (""high end"" HDMI cables, 192kHz recordings) know this very well and they aggregate around this target set of clients.<p>I think that is exactly what is happening here. At some point storage capacity is just good enough and one can distribute 48kHz, 16bit audio to everyone. But what do you do next? Everyone is getting that and it is not new and cool anymore. What to do? Well increase the frequency and sell everyone a newer, better, higher fidelity thing, even though objectively human years cannot really hear the difference. Subjectively though, there is a huge difference. If you ask someone who just spent $50 for a 192kHz record if they like it better than say a $20 48kHz one, I bet you 100% of people will confirm that 192kHz sounds better and will be ready to go and buy more.",1331014878

But as someone aspiring to do so, I find this article and others like it on HN frustrating.<p>For one thing, as mbenjaminsmith noted, for small (and I'd argue medium-sized) companies, setting up so many hoops for a programmer to jump through doesn't strike me as a very smart strategy -- you'll likely end up with very few candidates. But more importantly, the ""hoops"" listed in the article mostly filter for a particular type of candidate. In fact, the whole ""jump through hoops"" approach to hiring itself frustrates me -- not because I don't think I could jump through them, but because of the place I would end up in if I did.<p>I come to programming with (what I consider to be) a fairly diverse background. One of the things that I immediately sense in recently having crossed over (in my free time, currently) into coding and into the profession of coding is how homogeneous the community tends to be: on the surface (for example) almost exclusively male and dominated by a relatively narrow demographic, but deeper down also lacking in a diversity of life experiences.<p>I would argue that the process described in this article is partly responsible for maintaining this lack of diversity, <i>by the simple fact that it encourages the ""hoops"" mentality</i>.<p>Why do programmers think asking if Oct 31 and Dec 25 are the same day is funny? I have no idea. Can I find the largest int in an array? Sure, but why in the world are you asking me this?<p>And FizzBuzz (linked in #1): yes I get it, it's easy and it filters out 199 out of 200 candidates, but what about those 199 other candidates? Is it not possible that among them, you might have missed other candidates whose broader set of experiences would have taught <i>you</i> something that you didn't know, something more important than the fact they failed FizzBuzz, for whatever inconsequential reasons?<p>People have such a diversity of skills and experiences. Sure, a portfolio can express some of this. Selecting from your community (#3) also strikes me as very sensible. But to find the outlier candidates who have broader potential and knowledge of problems outside the ""canon"" of standard programming practice, I think you have to take a more open-ended approach.<p>In the end, I guess maybe the problem for me is that the whole ""How to Hire a Programmer"" idea itself strikes me as somewhat misguided. A guide to ""hiring a <fill_in_the_blank>"" is only ever going to filter for cookie-cutter representations of <fill_in_the_blank>, whatever that profession may be.",1331014866

Startup an audio editor and generate tones at 25k and 28k (make sure you can't hear them otherwise you have severe distortion screwing up your test) then play both at once. You will not hear a 3kHz tone.<p>The tone you get from an acoustic beat is not a real tone it's a perceptual quark that requires you to be able to hear the tones in the first place.",1331014100

Run around screaming, ""pivot"" your non-business until it's the lowest common denominator buzzword compliant non-product and get an exit.<p>It's like the Hollywood sitcom model. It's basically focus group driven and hit based. Your agent and connections are more important than acting ability. The market created around start-ups cares way way more about ""connectors"" than introverted technical talent. And you can't blame them, web development tools have gotten very good and there are all kinds of new niches to fill on the web. You run the numbers and they are worth more.<p>In many other career paths there are various different cultural norms that push back against this kind of pandering, with varying degrees of success.<p>If you think that the engineer personality type is well suited to push back against extroverted suits promising popularity, wealth and calling them ""rockstar programmers"" because ""you geeks are cool now"" in order to keep working on big problems or doing something honorable then you have more faith than I.<p>So I hope that we find a way to correct the perverse incentives in place but the rest of the world would also love to hear a solution to this problem.",1331013864

Because our ability to measure <i>g</i> (the general intelligence factor some psychologists think exists and others do not) is somewhere between marginal and nonexistent. Our attempts are better than they were but I don't know of anyone informed on the topic who would claim with a straight face that they're actually good.<p>2. Because intelligent people can be very, very wrong, and not just that, but wrong in more exciting ways than the average person. Libertarians tend to be intelligent, educated, and wrong about so many things it's barely worth debating them on politics or economics; doctrinaire Marxist Socialists are essentially the same way.<p>3. Because we're not starting from scratch, here; we're starting this system in an established political and social order, where opportunities for people to game this system as it's being born will be everywhere. If ensuring that my children have a berth on the deluxe class means redefining 'intelligence' to include them, I'll do it without looking back. Most people involved in politics now are like that, if not moreso.<p><i>Perhaps finishing HS could earn people a second vote. Finish college, you get a third vote. If you serve in the military, you get an extra vote. Experts in a particular field could get extra votes, etc.</i><p>This is so biased towards a certain subculture I don't know where to begin. It's almost tailor-written to cater to middle-class and rich people, predominantly White and Asian, especially those who are not gay or transgender or otherwise going to be effectively locked out of certain preferred careers or lifestyles, such as the military or top-flight schools. It is, in short, precisely what you would implement to turn America into Brazil or the Soviet Union or China, where there is no vertical mobility and birth absolutely determines outcome.<p><i>we can't do much worse at picking leaders and making policy decisions than we currently do in the US</i><p>I bring Russia, China, and most of Africa to your attention.",1331013720

Whereas tulips are a horrid store of value (they rot, anyone can grow them, are not divisible, etc), bitcoins are an excellent store of value. It is divisible, transferrable and easy to hide. Very similar properties have made gold a huge success as an investment vehicle. There are other goods similar to gold. For example, there are 20 billion CHF worth of 1000-CHF bills in circulation, most of them outside Switzerland. They are not used for purchases - they are used to preserve wealth. If bitcoin becomes one of those assets used to preserve wealth, its price can easily jump to 1'000 EUR per coin, giving it a similar capitalization as Swiss 1000 CHF bills.",1364730953

The chief goal of my work as educator and author is to help people learn how to write beautiful programs.</i><p><i>When we apply our own prejudices to ""reform"" someone else's taste, we may be unconsciously denying him some entirely legitimate pleasure. That's why I don't condemn a lot of things programmers do, even though I would never enjoy doing them myself. The important thing is that they are creating something they feel is beautiful.</i><p><i>I want to address my closing remarks to the system programmers and the machine designers who produce the systems that the rest of us must work with. Please, give us tools that are a pleasure to use, especially for our routine assignments, instead of providing something we have to fight with. Please, give us tools that encourage us to write better programs, by enhancing our pleasure when we do so.</i><p>Since JavaScript vs. TypeScript vs. Dart  are on my mind, I just want to mention that I have little complaint with JavaScript as a language, mostly with the tooling. My style is to shape and rework a program until I feel it is both correct and elegant, by my taste. Automatic error checking, refactoring and componentization are important to me. When those things are missing, I'm wasting time doing it manually and feel frustrated that I shouldn't have to do this, like building a house with a hammer and a hand saw when I could be using a nail gun and a power saw. I'm not in it for the joy of hammering and nailing, I'm in it to build a nice house.<p>Note to Dart developers: forget about the advanced language features. Those can wait to version 1.1. Just ship 1.0 as a more pleasurable way to write JavaScript. That's how I'm using it and I suspect this will be attractive to a lot of frustrated JavaScript developers.

It does not matter which banks hold the money or issue <i>loans</i> - Federal <i>or</i> private.  Issuing a loan to a private company (using tax dollars or otherwise) is the opposite of socialism, which tends towards de-privatization.<p>Secondly the author seems to push for socialism based on bank-bailouts.  There is nothing wrong with private banks, but there IS something wrong with bailing them out using government money.  Private enterprise must be able to fail, regardless of how ""big"" it is, in order to represent a properly capitalistic economy.<p>In shorter words, real capitalism = no government bailouts.

They think the regular person in the street cares that ""the man"" can track his purchases in the supermarket, or the beer he bought in a bar. They don't want to pay taxes. They think Cypriotic people will surely flock from shaky banks to an even more shakier currency and put all their live savings in Bitcoin, because it'll be safe.<p>It's so hard to actually get bitcoins, that any ""1 percent"" discounts you get for paying with bitcoin in regular shops or sites just isn't worth it to me. Either enter your CC# and be done in 10 seconds, or go to mtgox and wait 2 weeks until you're verified (hyperboled, but the point stands). I'm assuming less techy people will be of the same mind on this.<p>The reason any non techy person would get bitcoins is as an investment, that's it. They don't care about any of the advantages of bitcoin because cash works just fine for them, and has most of the practical advantages anyway. If they're using it as an investment, they sure as hell won't use it to buy things.",1364728453

The unions such as NEA and SEIU are among the most prolific political donors and most powerful lobbies, and routinely engage in both local and national politics, and any politician who wants to take on them takes huge risk.</i><p>Yes. We call those kind of unions apolitical and apathetic where I am from. They don't represent the workers interests, and they don't involve mass active participation from their members (like unions of old). They just make some union leaders ""political players"" and ""influencers"". I was referring to actual militant and mass-participation (not just mass registration) unions of old.<p>><i>You know that many labor measures - like minimal wages, etc. - were taken - with wide support of unions - to exclude blacks from labor markets, and at the time were openly acknowledged as such?</i><p>No, I know this to be a liberal myth.<p>For one, minimal wages were established all over the world, not only in the US. Including tons of places without blacks (or whites) or racial tensions. People all over the world have argued for, demanded, and still demand, minimal wage laws for reasons having absolutely nothing to do with some US racism issues back in the 19th century.<p>Second, if racism was prevalent in society at large, I wouldn't expect the unions of the time to be immune to that. Unions are made of people. So they could have said the things you quote but that doesn't mean the unions are inherently racist. It just means that unions in a racist society were racist. There are also lots of wonderful examples of collaboration between black and whites, and immigrants of all races and origins, in the US labor movement.<p>If anything, the businessmen and employers of the time were even more racist, because their interests (cheep labor, etc) depended on it. It's for business reasons that the slaves were brought to the US in the first place, after all, and it was done not by poor workers, but by wealthy businessmen and land owners.",1364727773

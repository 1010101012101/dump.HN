Taxes get paid quarterly, so imagine I&#x27;ve already paid them when I get hit with the fine.  Will the fine be discharged in my inevitable bankruptcy?

Our academic catalog management system(ACMS) is easy to use, easy to manage, and easy for students.  Academic catalogs are almost universally awful to use and their quality rarely reflects the quality of the institution that they represent. Smooth Bulletin helps schools put their academic catalog on the web in a way that they can be proud of.  If the school needs help, we’re happy to provide customization and integration services.<p>What sort of feedback am I looking for?<p>- Pricing: I honestly have no idea how to price this.  I understand that colleges have LOTS of money, but are they willing to spend it on a product like this?<p>- Product: Is this a good product?  Valid niche?<p>- Marketing: I need ideas for where to go from here.  I have lots of feature ideas, but what I really need are marketing ideas.  Are there any higher education tech conferences that I could get a booth at? Are adwords a good way to go? Cold calls? Cold emails?<p>- Funding: I&#x27;ve bootstrapped up to this point and will continue to do so, however is it worth pursuing funding for this?<p>- Other forms of learning: I&#x27;m thinking of expanding into corporate learning catalog management.  Maybe government learning stuff too.  Essentially if there is a curriculum for learning, Smooth Bulletin could manage it.  Good idea? Bad idea?<p>Thanks!",1384958665

Overall, I&#x27;m not tempted to buy either device (10+s to wake from sleep seems infuriating; my AppleTV takes about that long and it drives me bonkers).<p>My take on the next gen consoles is that it&#x27;s not clear there will be any winners. The current generation hasn&#x27;t actually been profitable for either Microsoft or Sony, and the economics of the industry have, if anything, gotten worse. (Sure, the market is bigger, but if you&#x27;re selling the platform at a loss hoping to profit on licensing then you need the cost per game to remain steady or go up.)<p>And there&#x27;s the other shoe: iOS / Android / Steam / Linux. E.g. if Apple were to release an iOS console (i.e. AppleTV on steroids) sometime in the next two years they could leave Microsoft and Sony to eat their loss leaders and take a huge chunk of the market away. (In general, Apple&#x27;s 30% cut of games is smaller than what the games companies pay to retailers and platform licensees, and Apple could always lower it if necessary.)<p>Overall I think it&#x27;s kind of a nightmare scenario:<p>1) Long wait since previous generation, so expectations are sky-high.<p>2) Each platform has been hit by at least one scandal -- PS4&#x27;s bricking, Xbox  One pricing model backdown followed by 720p launch titles (WTF?!)<p>3) Neither platform offering elegant out-of-box solutions despite numerous complaints with the previous generation (seriously, every time I launch my PS3 it needs to patch, and the same problem is in the PS4 and Xbox One).<p>4) Underwhelming launch titles.<p>Sony and Microsoft think they can ship a half-baked product and fix it over the next year or two, just like it &quot;worked&quot; for the previous generation (that pretty much lost them both money).",1384958601

Some of the people who have expressed concerns may be:<p>Citizens concerned about government officials overstepping constitutional bounds and lying about it, but not particularly concerned about the practical consequences of the surveillance.<p>Activists for whom NSA surveillance confirms that government  is not on the side of the people, but whose sense of history leads them to the conclusion that if massive FBI files, Jim Crow laws, and lynching did not stop the Civil Rights movement, metadata is unlikely to prevent the arc of history bending towards justice.<p>“Airbus nationalists” in Europe who are, in their heart, more concerned about the fact the EU seems to be incapable of developing a Facebook, Google, Twitter, ect. They may ape the language of their fellow citizens whose privacy concerns are based on Nazi/Stasi/etc. historical experience, but actually view cloud computing as industrial policy struggle.  Video game manufacture is likely not their strategic priority.<p>People with specific consequentialist privacy concerns.  For example, someone who hates Facebook because it has caused something embarrassing to be shared without their truly informed consent. They may be indifferent to the notion that embarrassing information is hidden on a government database, and they may actually welcome and value that Google algorithms leverage their g-mail and search history to serve up more relevant ads.<p>People who once cared, but are so sick of monomaniacs hijacking every HN discussion that they are looking forward to buying an Xbox One simply as a sign of contempt.  They likely also once were vaguely sympathetic to Google Reader users, but now see the product discontinuation as just punishment of tiresome and entitled whiners.<p>You may feel that all of these types of  people are wrongheaded, but change often happens because large groups of loosely affiliated people band together, and rarely because zealots double down and fail to see why anyone might <i>consider</i> a different point of view.",1384958345

Now try finding your dream home for your family in a high demand / low inventory market like SF or NYC. Its really hard, its more than hard. Its frustrating, its awful, it sucks! (Yes, I said it) Why   Why cant you find your dream home through your local MLS site or Zillow?<p>Theres only about 3% of all properties available to you on the open market. Shouldnt this be enough to find your craftsman style, 3 bed, 2 bath home with the white picket fence on that lovely cul-de-sac? The simple answer is NO.<p>We as a society are taught that if you work hard enough you are suppose to get everything you want and need. You WANT that extra bathroom, you NEED the best schools for your children  so why are you made to settle for a home thats only available (that flimsy 3%). Theres another 97% of homes which may be available to you. But how will these homeowners know you exist if you dont tell them.<p>Which brings me to say two statements :
 1.
Homeowners should know how many buyers are looking in their area, what exactly they are looking for and how much money people are willing to pay for their specific property - they can do this by providing a line of contact to perspective buyers.<p>2.
Buyers should have the ability to advertise themselves to homeowners in their interested areas - tell them everything your looking for to find a home; nice and easy! No more waiting around for months or even years for that dream home to come on the market or even worse settling for a property because its available.<p>Thanks to companies like Airbnb and Lyft; we live in a &#x27;sharing economy&#x27; which means we should be able to advertise our needs and wants and be matched up with them.<p>You can make this happen... who&#x27;s with me?",1384958333

But the point of having new developers is that they become experienced developers; a swarm of n00bs is not, in and of itself, valuable. Treating it as such is dangerous, as many, many rescue projects painfully illustrate.",1384957824

The evidence is pretty compelling. There&#x27;s a lot of crashing and burning out there. Is that because nobody is signing the log?<p>No, it&#x27;s because some companies do a really bad job of interviewing and hiring developers. This could be for a few reasons:<p>1. Companies are so hungry to attract developers they make an offer to the first candidate that seems remotely competent, only to see him/her struggle when they get out of the bootcamp and into the trenches of day to day work.<p>2. Companies have clueless people interviewing candidates for technical positions, and just do a bad job evaluating them.<p>For all of those &quot;novices&quot; that these bootcamps and such produce, some will go on to fizzle out, but my guess is some of them are actually talented/hard working enough to stick with it and evolve into competent developers. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s still the responsibility of the company doing the hiring to determine which is which.<p>The need for developers is only going to increase... so yes, we do need those hordes of novices, but with that need comes an increased responsibility to focus your hiring/recruiting efforts.",1384957556

I certainly remember a long time where I felt this way—that calculus was the entire reason for learning mathematics and the rest are a little silly or outdated. It took a long time for me to catch on to why the simple, silly stuff is where <i>all</i> of the fun is.<p>Today, calculus feels boring and dead to me. Obviously useful, but a mere tool instead of something greater. I spend my time thinking about things like topology where I work really hard to think about what it means for things to be close to one another and nothing more.<p>A younger me would not have understood. Which is a little scary.",1436475568

There&#x27;s a certain elegance in fixing the bug, but it has little practical significance. If you&#x27;re processing arrays with a billion or more elements, you need to be doing that in a 64-bit environment. In fact you <i>are</i> in a 64 bit environment, because your data won&#x27;t even fit into a 32 bit address space.<p>End of story.<p>Edit: just to be pedantic, and to forestall arguments, when I say &quot;64-bit environment&quot;, that means pointers, array indexes, etc are all 64 bits.

Bitbucket&#x27;s default looks way better for example, and github&#x27;s is quite good too.<p>My suggestion to make Gitlab fit better into my workflow:<p>* default page/tab for project root should be configurable,  either on per project or per user basis: I&#x27;d like to have the README as default for example, the Activity page by default interests me less.<p>* there should be a tab for issues on the default page, its more important than to see the activity IMHO<p>* you&#x27;ve got the clone URL in an easily accessible place, good!<p>* the Files view is quite similar to Github&#x27;s (good!), but I can&#x27;t figure out how to search (either fulltext or filename)<p>* I don&#x27;t see a button to create a new issue (I&#x27;m not logged in, should I login first? Github has a new issue button that takes you to login)<p>* how do I search in issues (fulltext?)<p>* how do I search for project names, or inside projects/issues globally?<p>* the default project page should somehow highlight or focus on making it easy and obvious the main aspects on how you&#x27;d interact with the project, if all features are shown in equal style it feels somewhat cluttered and overloaded.<p>P.S.: should I open a feature request about these on the gitlab site?",1436475519

At one point, Intel simply came on stage, surprised us with FinFETs and everybody was like: &quot;I guess it&#x27;s FinFET, then.&quot; The idea of FinFETs is actually from the 90s or so. The sole reason why noone did it before is because noone could actually build them at scale (AFAIK, Intel is still the only company that ships FinFETs).<p>Keep in mind that manufacturing is very hard. It is very unlikely that there will be more than incremental steps.

9860621,comment,9859620,9860549,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Alternatively, if the goal here is to stop hedge funds from taking advantage of long-term capital gains, perhaps it would make more sense to cap the <i>amount</i> of gains exempted as long-term and make the rest short-term.  Set a cap well above what the vast majority of individuals would hit, and below what any aggregate fund would hit.  For instance, &quot;long-term capital gains can only be applied to the first $150k of gains per year; gains above that are always taxed at the short-term rate&quot;.<p>> They get the relative burden of taxation shifted off the of other sources of income, including the source they are using to get money to pay for retirement. (The specific effect depends on how that relative shift is used.)<p>You say that as though an increase in taxes here will be used to decrease taxes elsewhere.  That does not match the reality of changes to tax law; tax revenue will simply increase, with no changes to taxes elsewhere.<p>> In any case, if the current favorable treatment of capital is inequitable, there is no entitlement for people to expect it to continue going forward.<p>There is no entitlement for government to apply arbitrary taxes and expect people to bear it, either, without providing a commensurate improvement in value.",1436475344

So you save in not having to duplicate that code as well as being able to change it everywhere rather than having to fix one API at a time.  Okay, sure, maybe you had a library or something that each API used, but this does make managing it very simple and simple is good, especially if you have hundreds or thousands of APIs.<p>In the API Gateway I work with allows you to do authentication within the gateway and then delegate responses to the back end API (which can still have its own security, if you really want it, but usually is just hidden on an internal network).  It works pretty much the same for other things like rate limiting.  It also gives you monitoring for each API, again cutting down on the things you have to add to every single API by encapsulating the function in the gateway.<p>Also, you can separate your internal API and your external APIs.  Maybe you have to always support certain operations to the outside world, but internally you&#x27;d really like to change something.  By having them separate, you can create a policy within the gateway to change how the internal calls are done without changing the interface as far as the outside world is concerned.<p>You can also do various types of conversion (e.g. REST->SOAP) or even more exotic things so that outside devs don&#x27;t have to care just how weird your damned mainframe is or other aspects of your internal architecture that they shouldn&#x27;t know about.<p>The target market is, effectively, anyone who wants to expose internal APIs to the outside world.<p>Source:  I work on an API Gateway and this is how our product works.",1436474661

Definitely needed a framework like that, and it was great.<p>-E.g. don&#x27;t use React, because in these cases it&#x27;s a total Rube Goldberg machine (extra steps to achieve the exact same outcome): Basic web app with some ajax submissions, adding results to DOM type of stuff. Maybe small html fragments cloned, inserted by jQuery. No extra fancy client interactivity.<p>^If people claim you should use React for the latter (undoubtedly some will), they are very likely just people who follow trends to follow trends, or maybe don&#x27;t have a ton of web experience and it&#x27;s one of the few things they&#x27;ve learned and are sticking to. It&#x27;s just so unnecessary (not to mention 100kb+ of overhead, & in my experience comes out to about x3 the amount of code). But yeah, absolutely use React if it&#x27;s anything like the first use case.",1436474479

D. in math from Berkeley, has given it a thumbs up). Thanks for sharing.<p>I really like the overall point of the post that mathematics once known can be forgotten or neglected, and mathematics written up for mathematics journals can be difficult to understand. Professor John Stillwell writes, in the preface to his book <i>Numbers and Geometry</i> (New York: Springer-Verlag, 1998):<p>&quot;What should every aspiring mathematician know? The answer for most of the 20th century has been: calculus. . . . Mathematics today is . . . much more than calculus; and the calculus now taught is, sadly, much less than it used to be. Little by little, calculus has been deprived of the algebra, geometry, and logic it needs to sustain it, until many institutions have had to put it on high-tech life-support systems. A subject struggling to survive is hardly a good introduction to the vigor of real mathematics.<p>&quot;. . . . In the current situation, we need to revive not only calculus, but also algebra, geometry, and the whole idea that mathematics is a rigorous, cumulative discipline in which each mathematician stands on the shoulders of giants.<p>&quot;The best way to teach real mathematics, I believe, is to start deeper down, with the elementary ideas of number and space. Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the &#x27;advanced&#x27; branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.&quot;<p>Stillwell demonstrates what he means about the interconnectedness and depth of &quot;elementary&quot; topics in the rest of his book, which is a delight to read and full of thought-provoking problems.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387982892/</a>",1436473967

Heck, put all of your funds into a Vanguard target-date fund (the laziest of the laziest) and you will do better than Wealthfront, with only 15 min of effort per year to rebalance.<p>The kind of tax loss harvesting Wealthfront does is usually a pseudo-benefit. You&#x27;re usually in a better position just holding until you need distributions for retirement. On paper it sometimes works out, but only when you make assumptions that generally involve timing the market to harvest without loss while avoiding wash sale rules.<p>That said, if you can&#x27;t be trusted or can&#x27;t trust yourself to buy a simple lazy portfolio and hold for decades, then by all means pay the 0.25% annual fee to have someone else take the management keys away from you.

I think they&#x27;re envisioning it as most likely being an install-time process, so that distributed code is still portable but they don&#x27;t have to worry quite so hard about the latency of the specializer. Ahead-of-time specialization will still need to be possible for creating things like bootloaders and OS install media.<p>I think it&#x27;s safe to say that the future will have a lot of fat binaries.",1436472138

To me, UI should be intuitive and never get in your way. I&#x27;m appalled to think that I need to spend time learning what a substructural type system is in order to analyze the complexity of my algorithms. I can verify the correctness of my algorithms just fine (to the extent I need them verified, which usually isn&#x27;t that much, at least not upfront), and so far I have seen zero evidence to support the claim that PFP makes developing software any cheaper. But I see more and more concepts going into abstractions and CH verification that I just can&#x27;t see the justification for such mental overload standing between me and my algorithms. I&#x27;m perfectly happy with a model checker in the very rare cases I need one, and it doesn&#x27;t require any substructural type systems, or even changing my choice of programming language (there are model checkers that work at the Java bytecode level and verify any program targeting the JVM regardless of the language).",1436472126

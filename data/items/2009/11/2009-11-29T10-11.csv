(They sadly lost out to NASA politically.)<p>An Orion exploration could generate money from extra-terrestrial mineral sources inside a not too long time window.<p>Second, consider how much longer the virtual reality thing would take if we were half as fast at speeding up computers (3 years for Moore's law, not 1 1/2). A not unrealistic assumption for a civilization with some other focus.<p>Third, consider if one of the small scale fusion projects (EMC, General Fusion, etc) works.  Or a future idea. Then an Oort cloud would be livable, for a technological civilization.<p>From that, it seems a large fraction of technological civilizations should not have all eggs on one planet/culture before cultural stagnation starts. And the groups further away would be able to see the problem happening to others and have a good chance to do things differently.<p>In the same way, a physics experiment with ""unexpected"" results would need to destroy a whole solar system and not only a planet.<p>The Fermi paradox should have some other answer.",1259492146

Yes, we need DARPA, NSF, &co to fund $10^9 research projects like space elevators or The Internet.

If you know your subject matter, it is not that much work, and the red tape can be well worth a six month budget.  Other than the red tape, which is not THAT bad operationally, the money is literally free.  There are often good opportunities from DoD, in some solicitations.  There's a new solicitation out from someone every few months.  <a href=""http://www.dodsbir.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dodsbir.net/</a>  A Phase I can lead to a Phase II - which can be $1 million or more.

If you have a background full of successful projects but no degree, you can still win by stuffing some MS/PhD's in as advisers.<p>That being said - for some of these it can take six months to hear whether you even won the grant, so this is not a primary funding strategy.  It is a supplementary funding strategy.  Its something to do, then forget about until you hear back.

Moving Wave into Gmail would give it a huge userbase, and partially address the ""email is universal"" problem. They could use MIME multi-part to send both a non-Wave, HTML version of the message, and the Wave version.

2758308,comment,2757778,2758132,9,0,briggsjustin,,,"As the writer of the story, I guess I should answer this.<p>I think the acronym ""SEO"" feels a bit outdated. The problems and strategies involved in SEO are far more involved than it often gets credit for.  There are a number of people who do the name a disservice and do bad SEO.<p>But the type of work I do at Distilled is working on incredibly creative projects.<p>It might include projects like managing domain consolidation across 3 domains comprising of pages in the millions without  allowing for a massive drop in traffic. To solving speed optimization issues, to account for crawl budgets that limit indexation. Or determining IA on large scale sites. Or helping optimize a site running on a 16 year old CMS that wont switch.<p>And in the same day, I may switch gears to brainstorm some of the most popular viral content on the internet.  Then I'll work with a client on their customer service center problems, because it's leading to reputation issues online.<p>Then later that week, I'll be on the phone with the CEO of a cool startup talking through strategic business ideas.<p>I get to help work on strategies that fall well outside the acronym of ""SEO"" that help lead to the success of some great brands.<p>As an ex engineering, math, and science fanatic - I love the problems that force me to just sit in front of a whiteboard for 2 days straight until I come out with a solution I think will work best for a client.<p>I love the complexity of the problems. However, in the industry, I'm more known for ""building links"" which is the aspect that allows me to be creative. Also, my ""hustle"" has made me successful at getting my clients coverage. But in link building, you get to work on projects like data mining and analysis on client data to create interesting content. Then I get to take that same content and pitch it to publications. It's such a dynamic process for one content piece to cover everything from brainstorming concepts, to data analysis, to outreach.<p>So yeah, I love SEO.",1310547582

2758282,comment,2755282,2756315,3,0,iamelgringo,,,"Thanks for the responses.  I have a few follow ups I'd love to get your perspective on.<p><i>+ DRAM is actually much higher on the memory pyramid than SSDs, so MemSQL handily beats MySQL on SSD any day</i><p>DRAM is an order of magnitude slower than SSD's.  It's also an order of magnitude more expensive, however.  You can get a TB of SSD for about $2k, which means 50TB of SSD for $100k, or the price of a single engineer for a year.  Meanwhile, a Quad High Mem EC2 instance (64GB of Memory is around $1,700 a month), or $20k a year.<p>Thoughts?<p><i>+ Putting MySQL on SSD doesn't change the fact that MySQL isn't optimized for SSDs or DRAM; so you're still using b-trees, latching and locking, etc.</i><p>True, but there are still a number of optimizations that can be made.<p>Issues like locking become a problem when IO is slow, and transactions have to wait for locks to clear.  When locks are 3 orders of magnitude faster on SSD's vs spinny disk, those issues tend to fade away.<p><i>+ SSDs have poor write endurance, meaning it has low number of write cycles</i><p>Agreed, SSD's have worse write endurance than RAM.  You should be able to architect around that fairly easily, however.<p>That being said, I spoke with Blekko's CTO, and out of the 700 SSD's they purchased 2 years ago to serve their index off of, they've had 2 drive failures.  Their index is write only.<p><i>+ You would still have to shard your database yourself; while MemSQL helps manage that process</i><p>Not having to shard is a Good Thing(TM).  But, if you can throw 10TB of SSD storage in a server, sharding should be less of an issue unless you're dealing with Google(n) sized data problems, no?  I suspect that 10 TB of DRAM MemSQL would be cost prohibitive.<p><i>+ DRAM is available on the cloud today while it will be some time before SSDs are offered on most public clouds.</i><p>Absolutely correct, but SSD's are rapidly replacing spinning disk in Enterprise data centers.  I suspect that the first VPS service that offers SSD storage is going to rapidly kill the competition because of the insane performance differential.  How long am I going to be willing to pay an extra $10 a month for 1 GB of extra RAM in my VPS when I can purchase an 80 Gig SSD for $120?<p>+++++++++++++++++++++<p>I'm not trying to troll or be difficult.  I'm honestly looking for answers to the in memory / NoSQL / MemSQL vs SSD debate.  I've looked at the issue from a number of different angles, but I keep coming down on the SSD side.  I figured you would have some of the best, most thought out rebuttals to the issues I've been thinking about.<p>But, everybody seems to be using Cloud VPS's because they seem very wary of putting some hardware together and throwing it in a rack.  I suspect that because I've been rolling my own PC builds for more than a decade, I'm probably much more excited about throwing 20 SSD's in a 2 x 8 core server to see what it would do than someone who has purchased Mac laptops for most of their career.  (not flaming, just thinking out loud).<p>I have a theory that a side effect of Apple owning the startup developer market is that developers think of servers as something residing in a cloud to be rented rather than built from parts.  And, because of that, things like NoSQL and non-relational databases have gotten a ton of buzz rather than throwing a _little bit of money at hardware to solve the problem.<p>Thoughts?",1310545987

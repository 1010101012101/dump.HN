I'm tired of bland semi-advice that's watered down to go over well with everybody.",1245412761

To avoid the kind of ""social profiling"" you describe you'd have to make sure that police don't have any incentive to make as much money as possible. Also, I suspect that rich people might sue and thus deter police from doing things like that.",1245412749

If Bill Gates goes to prison, he loses the same amount of time. Expressed in money, he's paying a few million dollars in lost productivity whilst you may only lose the equivalent of a few thousand dollars. I think that's fair.",1245412275

An ex-university friend has approached me with a proposition to do some websites - he works for an IT consultancy that doesnt do web design but has said it is willing to hand off customers who want sites to him (in the region of 2 or 3 a month). It's a good gig and looking over the specs for the first job he has it looks like a reasonable amount of work.<p>He wants to split 50/50 - he brings the clients and does the design work pluss some admin etc. I do the site building and technical consults. Again it seems a fair deal because he can bring the serious clients.<p>Anyone spot a catch? More importantly any advice on how to get set up?<p>Obviously I will want an actual agreement - would a simple partnership (im in the UK_) suffice do you think?<p>Also as I am working remotely (though will be paid a day's travelling per job so I can meet clients face to face initially - I feel this is important :)) does anyone have recommendations for tools to collaborate on these specific projects (I will probably use bitbucket for SCM and ticketing etc. so more in terms of communication & work hour tracking).<p>And finally if your already doing similar work what kind of rate would you expect to be paid for this work (initially we are looking at £25/hr to get initial traction going up to £70/hr as things progress / we get a reputation)? + any other advice :)<p>Cheers peeps :)",1245412126

At US$ 190 total cost of manufacture for the 2, I would risk the wireless free forever subsidy seems to be a substantial part of the unit cost. Would it be a safe bet to estimate the display of the DX to be around US$ 120?<p>So, again, I would be happy with a DX that used wi-fi or my own GSM/3G instead of the US-only cellular network.

I was pining for the days when I could call my travel agent and have an actual human take care of my travel arrangements.

It then becomes a part of my thinking. Similarly, if I'm working on a problem, I often get insight from other activities, including reading.<p>Reading well-written books and essays influences the way I express myself, unconsciously.<p>I also think it keeps the mind supple, to be able to absorb new perspectives. Perhaps even more important, is to be reminded that they are things I don't know, and didn't even suspect (the particular things aren't so important, just <i>feeling</i> of not knowing as much as I thought.)",1245409929

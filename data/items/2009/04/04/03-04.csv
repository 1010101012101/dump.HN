Asserting that crises are cyclical and ""naturally emergent"" doesn't rule out greed and stupidity as causes. It actually doesn't say anything about causes at all.<p>I'd also be wary of concluding that because certain phenomena appear to be cyclical, any similar phenomena must necessarily be an expression of that cycle.",1238817322

Unfortunately, the one thing that is somewhat above this discussion is the idea of assessing job performance itself.<p>The research I'm referencing links hiring metrics to performance reviews. Clearly, there is something to be said that the items measured in performance reviews might be highly suspect as well, and prone to many forms of bias -- so earlier methods that predict these could actually be just self-fulfilling, not actually a good way to find awesome employees in any particular situation. Again, unfortunately, thats a little beyond the scope here, clearly.<p>In addition, I think that people that did well on standardized tests tend to be for their usage in hiring metrics, and those who didnt but consider themselves successful do not. Bias at work.",1238817074

546028,comment,545821,545987,0,0,banned_man,,,"I feel like Lisp's big win over C, Java, etc. is its support for aesthetically pleasing functional programming. Much more of the difference between Lisp and Blub comes from functional programming than from user-defined macros.<p>Macros are cool, but I don't write my own macros very often, especially when working in Clojure, which has great built-in ones. Most of the general-purpose macros implemented in, say, On Lisp have decent analogues built into Clojure or Clojure.Contrib.<p>Python, Ruby, et al haven't necessarily gotten as good as Lisp, academically speaking, but for a lot of purposes, they're good enough.<p>I think that anyone who wants to consider himself a serious hacker needs to learn Ocaml or Haskell, though, in order to gain exposure to what a good static-typing system has to offer.",1238816933

546017,comment,544828,545506,0,0,sho,,,"Like above I didn't make myself clear at all. Let me try again, by your leave.<p>I wasn't claiming you can't tack feature X onto lisp, of course you can, you can implement anything in anything. The point I wanted to make was that ""power"" is not just some object feature bullet points, it's about ease of use and syntax and libraries as well.<p><i>""If you add Traits (library for Mixins) to Smalltalk, it is equivalent to Ruby in power. (1)""</i><p>Only for your definition of ""power"".<p>Yes, everyone loves Ruby's super-flexible objects and mixins etc but that is only the start of the story. Its syntax is terse, intuitive and good-looking. The rubygems packaging system is effective and ubiquitous. Irb is excellent and ""live coding"" techniques are invaluable. To me, these are very much part of the real ""power"" and the main reason I prefer it over, say, Python. You might be able to emulate the object behaviour but it's still ""incomprehensible mess of brackets"" Lisp.<p>You might be able to claim that Lisp is 90% ""homomorphically equivalent"", a phrase I don't think I've heard since Mathematics 2, but who gives a shit? Go ahead and add the last 10% of whatever it is that Ruby has and Lisp doesn't. Now you have just as much power as Ruby? So go ahead and type ""require activerecord"" (don't forget to compile!) and just try to tap into that power. Oops.<p>""Language power"" is not just some reductive theoretical idea of what features a language has, or could implement. It's the whole package, and how you use it. Sure you can add Ruby's features to C. But a better way is to <i>implement Ruby</i> in it.<p>Lisp might well be the infinitely flexible meta-language which can be used to describe all others, but that isn't actually useful in itself, as used today. Lisp may be an incredibly powerful tool for something, but it has little advantage for conventional end-user code, not any more anyway. It's pretty exciting to think where it might end up, though.<p><i>""And one could probably take just about any Lisp and give it the power of the other 10% (like Erlang) with moderate effort.""</i><p>Again, only for your definition of ""power"", which is not what the average programmer who is just interested in getting stuff done is thinking about.",1238815718

Not all of it, but enough to possibly make a difference.<p>The flip-side of this is that if there are people who, due to some or another in-born trait, are unable to cultivate an attitude of continued hunger for knowledge, that is something they need to deal with by not entering into a profession that demands it.

It takes a lot of careful time to think about what makes a great story.  Pay attention to what the press writes about and where they see conflict (always a good source for a story).  Creating your story around how you are going to be a game changer relative to 4 unknown startups vs how you are going to revolutionize a market dominated by google, microsoft, etc.. journalists and press will obviously write the latter.<p>why?  b/c what they care about is driving page views and readers.  some do care about the topic and the story and trade on their reputation for being a deep expert.

546003,comment,545856,545943,0,0,apinstein,,,"You say a lot of things... let me take them a few at a time:<p>On arbitrage - I don't consider this financial crisis to have much to do with arbitrage. I am not sure you understand what arbitrage is; it isn't ANY money-making activity. It's when a middleman exploits transient differences in prices in markets. In any case, I never said arbitrage was evil. However, if the arbiter makes his money by exploiting an externality, then someone is losing. This is simply a notable side-effect.<p>On incentives - I don't buy the line that regulation caused that many warped incentives. Maybe some, but not all. And this would have happened WITHOUT the regs that might have caused some of the incentive anyway. None of the tax policies shifted behavior that significantly. Being able to deduct mortgage interest does differentially favor homeowners, but it doesn't affect the risks involved in becoming a homeowner. At worst it artificially inflates home prices.<p>On Glass-Steagall - I don't know it well, but one very useful effect of it was to compartmentalize risk. As anyone on HN should know; isolating risks in independent buckets drastically reduces the chance of major bad things happening. It's the sheer scale of the crisis that makes it bad; most of this stuff was ultimately pushed by a small handful of banks at the top. It also separated different types of investing which prevented oligopoly situations and group-think from having as big of an effect on the market. It put different companies on opposites sides of investments rather than the same side and probably had the effect of improving real-world due diligence. But I am just WAG'ing here on this one.<p>On bailout - I don't think taxpayers should be subsidizing bond or equity holders in any of these financial companies. Not sure where you got that idea, not from me.<p>On regulation - it's not ironic at all. You are presenting logical fallacy. Just because reg A is stupid doesn't mean regs B-Z are. They are unrelated. I am all for regs that help prevent massive market failures or allow massive externalities to persist over time. In the end, the citizens pay for it in taxes and instability. It is true that more regs would probably dampen some of the GDP upside, but IMHO that's a fine tradeoff compared to the economic havoc of massive recessions.",1238814546

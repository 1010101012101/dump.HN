Like when I move to a new city and don't know anyone, or broke up with a girlfriend, or had a shitty job, or have some looming deadline for work that I have zero interest in.<p>About a month ago, we started having severe problems at the startup I work for. The finances are a total mess and the boss has been irrationally taking it out on a couple other employees who are friends of mine. What's ultimately going to happen is a bunch of people are going to leave en masse, and if I don't go with them, I'm going to be stuck cleaning up the mess they left behind. After learning this, it sort of feels futile to do anything at work, and subsequently my hacker news karma has finally passed 1000! It leaks out into the rest of my life, too. I feel pretty stupid that I quit my old startup to work at this one. I really should be looking for a new job, or working on a startup idea of my own. However, general fear and bummed-outedness has been steering me to instead do stuff like stay up until 4AM reading the entire blog archives of all my favorite female musicians.<p>Maybe a bit too personal and self-helpy, but I haven't ever felt like I was wasting too much time online when everything  else in my life was going smoothly. On the other hand, maybe internet time-wasting is an unavoidable job hazard of a VC who funds a lot of fun projects.",1211072026

By their very nature, start ups can't possibly list things like expected salary or equity because those heavily dependent on what you yourself bring to the table.

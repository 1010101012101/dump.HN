668500,comment,668381,668381,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"The only reason to write in a language like C or Java today (over Python) is speed. And there are a very limited number of applications that require that sort of speed. There's no question that Linux should be written in a low level language, or a high-performance chess bot. But I'm incredulous when I see anyone write a website in even the relatively high-level Java.<p>So, the author is right that we're getting more Pythonic, but he's wrong to say we'll all write in Python some day. Some day, something like Python will be the fast low level language, there will be new slower languages that are easier to use than Python, and C will be a memory. The evolution of programming languages will never end, not in our lifetime certainly, and probably not as long as we walk the earth.<p>I must say though that I pray for more convergence. It annoys me to write code in JavaScript and Python, having to remember subtle differences between the two as small as capitalization of true and False, and tricky pitfalls like the scope of a variable declared in an if block.<p>It does seem an unnecessary burden for me as a web developer to have to know a handful of languages. You can hardly make a website today without knowing HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python/Ruby, and you better know your SQL too. Then, let's talk APIs.",1245664450

While I assume this is just meant to be a funny little quip, it's too offensive to just let slide.<p>First of all, you compare dating women to fishing, as if women where objects to be acquired.  This <i>might</i> be forgivable if there were <i>any</i> merit to the statement, but there is not.<p>Women, as self-aware agents, are quite capable of giving very good advice about dating women, both from self-reflection (knowing what they do and do not like, etc.) and from talking with other women about dating.  Not to mention that some women date other women.<p>I'm not trying to pick on you; I just found this statement to be in poor enough taste that I couldn't in good conscience fail to say something.",1245663560

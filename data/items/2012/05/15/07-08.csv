I have above average intelligence and am willing to work hard. The thing is, I haven't spent the last 3 years of college wisely. I do love computer science and programming, but simply slacked off these last 3 years. A couple of my direct seniors in college got hired by facebook and about 6 of them by Microsoft during campus interviews. I feel guilty for wasting all this time and for not utilising my potential. Many of my friends have been coding on TopCoder and similar websites while I have done nothing... Apart from this, I have quite a load in the upcoming year with my final year project for which my professor results in terms of publication in some top-journal.<p>Anyway,<p>What advise do you have for me? I have about 3-4 months from MS interview and about 8 months from Facebook. Google doesn't come to my campus, but I hope to make it through the online application. Is this sufficient time? What should my study plan be like? I know it's subjective, but how good do I need to be?<p>P.S - I have ordered the CLRS (Introduction to algorithms) & Algorithm Design Manual from Amazon yesterday.",1337068624

When I lived in NYC, traveling on the train during non-peak times was so stressful I avoided it like the plague.  Always late.  Noisy as hell.  Smells like a cesspool.  During rush-hour the train might stop in the middle of a tunnel, and the lights go out, the whole time it is not even air conditioned.  I visited NYC 2 months ago after a few years away, and the floating filth in the tracks was still there of course.  My Japanese travel companion who had never been in NYC before took only two train rides (at non-peak hours) to declare a strong negative impression of the NYC subway.<p>Maybe you live in another NYC where there are no trains?

Think of like twitter, everyone is almost always online thanks to bouncers or irssi+ssh setups and you can query whoever you want or need. They may respond if they see your message and think it deserves an answer.<p>I'd say most of its interest comes from the support channels like #rubyonrails or #python where you basically help people. After a while, you get to know regular users and thus making new connections or even friendships. As an example, I've got friends hanging out in a french sys-admin related channel who sent to me people looking for python training. I made an offer and we later called to them to finalize the order. I'd say such things are a consequence of your genuine participation in channels rather an objective in itself.<p>I use quassel as an IRC client, the core is installed on my personal server, being always connected. I connect from my home or my laptop and always get only what I haven't read thanks to quassel acting a bit like IMAP. I also have a bitlbee setuped in order to act as a gateway to gtalk and hipchat, meaning I got every single possible chat protocol I may use in quassel.<p>I desactivated notifications, which means If I minimize quassel, I won't see anything, letting me focused. After each focused work cycle ( like every 30-45 minutes ) I just check if anything happened there and answers depending its importance and my current priorities. I don't say I'm not available, which may lead in a debate on why I can't answer right know, I just don't answer back until I got prioritized stuff done first.<p>This way I can handle chat with wrecking daily productivity. As opposed to that, phone just trouble my productivity, I almost never answer on my phone except for a few people and use almost exclusively chat to avoid that.",1337068271

When I was contracted to build this I was assured that they were building several other clusters for use as test, QA and prod and that all I had to do was build the dev system and document so thoroughly that the other systems could be built from the documentation. At the time I wasn't yet security cleared so would not be allowed to build the other environments.<p>Some time later (6-8 months) I was called back to help solve a performance related problem. When I arrived I discovered that the dev machine was now production, and that no other machines were built. I would have to do the work on production.<p>Worse though... their backup and failover mechanism wasn't what I'd documented, but involved an identical piece of hardware nearby which was powered off. They hoped to simply turn it on when production failed.<p>Their daily process was to approach the disk array and remove the 1st hot swappable disk from the live machine, and swap it with the 1st disk in the powered off identical system. When the array had rebuilt the first disk, then move the 2nd disk.<p>I am seldom speechless. It was only a critical part of a 2bn project.

Damn, being wrong just cost me a 10x return on my investments I wasn't making.  I better start investing before I lose even more!'<p>I literally remember reading a comment from someone in the late 90's 'Not buying a house 3 years ago has cost me 400,000.'<p>Well, in retrospect, no it didn't, it was just a bubble.<p>The protection against a bubble isn't waiting until it's a long, well-established bubble: the protection against a bubble is having lots of sales and lots of cash stored away.  If you're punished too much after a bubble-pop in your valuation (get priced at a tiny price per earnings) great: you can now buy back your shares and mint money by selling them again when your price to earnings is something reasonable.<p>on the other hand, if you don't have sales, your price to earnings is infinite.

Higher rates during the last decade would have caused stagnation in Germany but would have avoided the complete demolition of some countries. Note that this demolition process was not only beneficial for Germany, but also for bank tycoons in these countries - their direction is now a bunch of billionaires despite whatever happens to their banks now. In these countries 2 full generations basically have had their lives destroyed from being out of the housing and job market chronically, and those with a job will have most of their disposable income confiscated. These are the really important figures usually not told in the BBC, Euronews or Deutsche Welle.<p>And the worst part of it is the ""rescue"" - the rescue consists in ensuring the banks in the most affected countries don't need to sell their massive housing stocks in a firesale. It basically consists in pegging housing prices in these impoverished countries so their average house costs twice the price of a house in an average German city, keeping 30+ year olds (the generation coming out of school during the euro-originated frenzy from last decade) homeless or living with their parents. The rescue basically consists in perpetuating this tragedy: a lost generation, birthrates to the ground (impossible to emancipate), people deprived of a sane life plan and forced to be enslaved for decades. Because that's what happens when you ""so kindly"" inject money to these over-stocked banks. They. Won't. Let. Their. Stocks (housing mostly). Lose. Value. This will only happen when you cannot continue ""helping"", the sooner the better. But this will ultimately happen, thankfully.<p>That's the rescue plan.

This has pushed the renters who used to live there further and further out, or forced their standard of living ever further downward.<p>I disagree with the idea that existing homeowners have some right prevent developers from building tall housing nearby on PRIVATE property.  You own your land, I own mine, and as long as I'm not doing anything toxic, your rights do not extend into my space.  These anti-development policies force people to live far away from their workplace, turning most of the bay area into a massive wasteland of highways and parking lots.<p>A few incredibly lucky and selfish people can deny the right of the many to have the dignity of affordable housing, but it is not just.  It is shameful.<p>As an aside, despite artificially enforced low-density, Berkeley and Palo Alto have depressingly few vibrant public spaces.  Sure there's trees along the street, but most of the parks are just little tiny bits of grass and a few scraggly trees sandwiched between two or three active roads.  You'd think low density might include huge open parks, but no, it is mostly just big houses with private yards and lots of parking lots to deal with how far apart everything is.<p>Contrast: In Tokyo, since there is almost nothing preventing you from doing whatever you like with your own land, there is a wide mix of different housing to choose from, at all different price-points.  I can afford to live smack in the middle of everything, near the biggest park and shopping area, also a few minutes walk from a major train station.

Testing event-based code isn't necessarily <i>that</i> hard (testing is never really easy in a language where you're always in the local IO monad equivalent, though cracking it up into events does make things challenging, especially if you try to take advantage of closures in your handlers, which unfortunately is advantageous in other ways but hurts testability hard) but it doesn't help that the frameworks never seem to ship with the testing support I just specified and I'm always having to bash it together myself, which tends to show a certain... disconnect in expectations between me and the authors.",1337066217

Initially I loved Rails but migrated to Code Igniter cuz it's lightweight and loosely coupled(You don't even need to run with a model if you choose to but it follows the MVC structure quite well). <p>Plus it outperforms Rails in the speed department. It doesn't sport much magic compared to Rails. But that's ok if you're like me and you want to keep looking under the hood and see how stuff runs on CI. And it doesn't constrain you as much if you want to stretch out and really make it run. <p>It actually made PHP fun to learn(if you don't mind the fugly syntax). It also supports Active Record btw.

And if someone was to set up a trusted list of URLs to block and the plugin updated occasionally whole swaves of ads would disappear and not be loaded.<p>Has anyone any stats from their site that show how many people are blocking ads?",1180690582

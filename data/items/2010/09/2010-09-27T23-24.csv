    * AOL is on the verge of acquiring TechCrunch. 
    * The deal is at a sensitive stage and might fall apart yet, but I don’t think so. 
    * Sources familiar with both entities says that the announcement is likely to come onstage at Disrupt, TechCrunch’s flagship conference currently underway in San Francisco.
    * AOL CEO Tim Armstrong is likely to make an appearance at the conference, and perhaps that’s when the announcement is likely to be made. 
    * AOL in the past had acquired Weblogs Inc., the blogging company behind popular sites such as Engadget. Those blogs have helped AOL compensate for steep loss of traffic. The service has been in the market to buy a technology blog, and is rumored to have been linked with other technology blogs.",1285631747

He did not address the fact that funding was not provided but just said that my article was increasing his faith in the US government for choosing not to fund molecular nanotech. As for my authority, I do not say believe me because of my background or my certifications. I provide the logical connections and historical facts which are not dependent upon authority. As for how much I know about molecular nanotechnology. I have lectured at the Singularity university twice on the subject but the nature of the lecture was to provide a review of the latest developments in the field. I show that I am current what is happening by writing 99% of the articles on the website nextbigfuture. There are a few hundred articles on nanotechnology and a few dozen on molecular nanotechnology. I believe that I am qualified as a scientific journalist who covers advanced technology and proposed advanced technology. I had the link to Locklin's site until he would not engage in a reasoned discussion. He did not publish any of my comments on his site and if you look at his article and discussion thread on his site you will see that the level of discussion is one of flamewars. Frankly he just annoys me.<p>As for Smalley. There have been mechanosynthesis experiments which have broken and made covalent bonds. So anyone who claims there is a scientific flaw in the concepts of mechanosynthesis needs to address this evidence. Also, Smalley promised rocking chair carbon nanotubes for transforming the electrical grid. But tens of millions have been spent there and there has not been one commercial watt transmitted with carbon nanotubes. I am aware that there is slow progress but there are huge gaps between what Smalley promised back in 1995 and what has been done. I was also present when Smalley was giving a talk at one of the Foresight conferences and said that within a year he would be creating carbon nanotubes so long that they would be spooled onto a spindle. Meters long. It was about 13 years later that anything approaching that length was produced and it was done by Windel at Cambridge and only for a few strands. Of course Smalley died but it was not Rice University.<p>This is just to show that Smalley (nobel prize winner) and his authority does not make him immune from being wrong. So neither does any authority claimed by Locklin. And I do not expect any authority from me to make a case. I expect facts and logic to make the case.<p>currently there is a project by Philip Moriarty in the UK to try and prove the computational chemistry work of Merkle and Freitas. There has been a delay getting the equipment and the perfectly smooth surface acquired. the equipment took a little over a year and is there now but as of a conversation with Merkle and Freitas a few months ago, they indicated that Moriarty indicated the atomically smooth surface was holding up the main experimentation.",1285631069

They're systems programming languages. When you're writing a kernel or embedded software, having the language mandate some kind of concurrency model at the standards level is nonsensical.<p>I wasn't linking decades to DragonflyBSD, I was saying that the techniques and methods have been known and used for decades.<p>The original point, restated here for clarity is this.<p>Go was supposed to be a new-age systems programming language. Its current design (mandated concurrency model and global GC) preclude that from ever happening without fundamental changes.<p>Rust has a better chance of becoming the next systems programming language.<p>I don't know what your niche or corner of the realm of software is, but I get the feeling you're commenting on a field you have no substantial experience in.<p>It's evident to anybody with any real experience or wisdom concerning software that having choices like concurrency made for you at the language-level narrow the scope of usefulness for that particular language and pretty much precludes it from being a top-grade choice for embedded/systems development.<p>Example:<p>Were it not for the glut of hardware performance and memory capacity improvements in smartphones, Dalvik/java would've been impractical at <i>best</i> on Android. It's still a vastly inferior experience compared to the iPhone, which is obj-c with optional drop-down to C/C++.<p>And don't mention the NDK for Android, it's a bad joke.<p>Bootstrapping a runtime for a language that depends on a particular concurrency model irrespective of the problem at hand is stupid beyond my faculty for describing with words.<p>tl;dr good luck using Go for hard real-time systems.<p>Why do you think C++ achieved popularity so quickly? It was pliable to the demands of the problem being solved just like C at the expense of complexity.",1285630559

Sometimes I'll have a comment where for no reason it gets down-voted almost immediately only to be up-voted back to its baseline (1) later. I realize a lot of people here think down-voting is a way of showing disagreement, but how about the times you get down-voted for asking a question in a thread? It makes no sense! It stifles the conversation and does nothing to further the discussion. It may be taboo to bring this up but sheesh someone should.

1733896,comment,1733236,1733236,0,0,raminf,,,"I've always thought of YC as more of an incubator for young 20-somethings trying to get an idea off the ground. The impression has been fortified by the reported small amounts of 'seed' that is given out. I know a lot of people in older  age brackets (30s-40s-50s) with a family and Silicon Valley mortgage who have great ideas and experience but wouldn't even consider approaching YC.<p>My one suggestion is if you want to expand your age/experience bracket and get these people to apply, you may want to address issues directly relevant to them. One suggestion is to relabel the investment to something more like a 'stipend' and explain clearly that it's not expected to cover salary and life expenses, but only to help defer company expenses. That way, people know that they need to set aside enough savings to cover their family.<p>The other is to spell out clearly the policy of working on outside projects (to bring in some money) during the YC 3-month period. Leaving it ambiguous keeps out people who need a part-time gig to bring in some money but could spend the rest of their waking time working on a cool product.<p>I know people who work as consultants and make $10K-$25K in a month. To these people, the YC 'investment' is more of a deterrent. The main attraction would be to get wired into the network and tap into the experience YC and its alumni can offer. It would be good if you could clarify whether it makes sense for them to apply or not.<p>Overall though, a good write-up with a decent level of detail. Thanks for putting it up.",1285629243

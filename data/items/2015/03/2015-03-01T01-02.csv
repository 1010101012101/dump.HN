9125745,comment,9124792,9125703,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, my favorite chocolate cake ever was vegan (from The Green Planet in Houston, an <i>incredible</i> but now defunct vegan restaurant). But, I&#x27;ve never been able to <i>make</i> one that good. I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done, just that I haven&#x27;t gotten it right yet.<p>Brownies, on the other hand, are a nightmare to veganize, for me. It may have to do with the kind of brownies I like, and it may just be that I&#x27;ve had enough bad luck that now my baking mojo is broken for making brownies. I&#x27;ve tried three batches in pretty quick succession, using quite different seeming recipes, and they all turned out <i>awful</i>; and awful in roughly the same way in all cases. Kinda like overly oily fudge, with some flour mixed in just to make it even more gross. I&#x27;m not sure, honestly. I&#x27;ve not tried it again lately, but will eventually. I love a good brownie. But, I was so disheartened by the first several attempts, that I&#x27;ve been avoiding it.<p>And, I can&#x27;t think of a really good vegan brownie that I&#x27;ve ever eaten, and I know some quite good vegan cooks, and tend to frequent vegan restaurants and bakeries while traveling.",1425175158

9125729,comment,9123702,9124853,0,0,veidr,,,"Since the 1990s, IMAP (an open standard with hundreds of implementations covering virtually all platforms) has allowed you to access all of your mail, from anywhere, on whichever device you want.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use just one IMAP client, you can use many clients, just as you might use several different web browsers or text editors. They all access the same mail store, and the message state (read, flagged, replied to, etc) is synchronized among all the clients (this is what the IMAP protocol is for).<p>On a decently powerful computer, searching is typically faster than any online service, including Gmail (though it depends on the mail client).<p>Thunderbird&#x27;s search is fairly poor. On OS X, I mainly use MailMate and Apple&#x27;s default Mail.app client software. Both of these can search through my 500,000-message email archive (all my personal email in/out since 1995) much faster than any online service I have seen.<p>With a dedicated mail client, you can also have all your mail without being online -- to me, this is essential for working on international flights.<p>Being able to use multiple standards-based clients also lets you avoid keeping all your eggs in one basket. You can use the best client on each platform that suits you.<p>I only ever use Thunderbird on Windows, where there are not many good email clients. OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android all come with better (for my needs, YMMV) email clients than Thunderbird.<p>Finally, IMAP is a real standard with a huge body of work behind it. I look forward to even better standards emerging, e.g. something like JMAP[1] maybe, but for now we do have IMAP, and it solves every single problem that web-based email solves (indeed there are many webmail UIs that give you online browser access to your IMAP email store). But with native clients you also gain several advantages over typical webmail service from Gmail, AOL, Hotmail, etc.<p>Plus no ads.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jmap.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmap.io</a>",1425174655

Having no way to disable it without going into obscure parts of the UI that no normal user (or even normal power-user) is ever likely to find is also a dark pattern.<p>I agree that &quot;Burying opt-out phone home behaviour in nothing but legalese small print is a dark pattern.&quot;  But I think you&#x27;re mis-characterizing this specific instance of the blocklist ping as &quot;covert, opt-out surveillance&quot; and the arguably fairly readable privacy policy as &quot;legalese small print&quot;.<p>Specifically, I think the blocklist feature paragraph is quite good and not weasel-words.  It explains:<p>- Tersely what/when/why Thunderbird does the blocklist ping: &quot;Thunderbird also offers a Blocklist feature.  With this feature, once a day Thunderbird does a regularly scheduled, automatic check to see if you have any harmful add-ons or plug-ins installed.&quot;<p>- What Thunderbird does with that information: &quot;If so, this feature disables add-ons or plug-ins that Mozilla has determined contain known vulnerabilities or major user-facing issues or fatal bugs (e.g., Thunderbird crashes on startup or something causes an endless loop). You may view the current list of Blocklisted items.&quot;<p>- The information included in the blocklist ping: &quot;This feature sends Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including the version of Thunderbird you are using, operating system version, build ID and target, update channel, and your language preference. This feature also sends Potentially Personal Information to Mozilla in the form of your IP address and a cookie.&quot;<p>- What Mozilla does with the information (which is indeed not trivially obvious): &quot;In addition, Mozilla also uses this feature to analyze Thunderbird usage patterns so we may improve our products and services, including planning features and capacity.&quot;<p>- A disclaimer about the lack of UI: &quot;Currently there is no basic user interface to disable the Blocklist feature.&quot;<p>And then we have 2 more sentences:<p>- The link on disabling and why you wouldn&#x27;t want to disable: &quot;This feature can be disabled by following the instructions in this article. Disabling the Blocklist feature is not recommended as it may result in using extensions known to be untrustworthy.&quot;<p>And that was all of it.<p>In regards to the UI, if there had been a discussion about whether we should have a basic UI affordance for disabling the feature (there was not, to my knowledge), I think the bulk of the Thunderbird team would have argued against it because the risk to the user of rogue plugins/extensions was and continues to be serious.  (Plugins probably more than extensions; Thunderbird tends to pick-up all the plugins that Firefox would see and most adware/malware implementors seemed otherwise unconcerned with Thunderbird.)  Now if the checkbox also entirely disabled extensions and plugin loading, that could provide a safe trade-off for the user.  But then we run into the whole &quot;supported configuration problem&quot;.  Every option adds new permutations that can lead to new failures, etc.",1425173348

Several times I have come across people discussing that Merge which is much more powerful the simple upserts, also doesn&#x27;t really mandate the nature of upserts in most databases.<p>Simply a user might expect that upserts always succeed with either an update or insert, and never return an error (except when the consistency model is set high enough).<p>The problem is that many implementations of merge doesn&#x27;t provide that guarantee, unbeknownst to many users. Or they are simpler databases such as sqlite (which doesn&#x27;t provide the same multi-user/transaction performance). Postgres, as they are well known for, want to implement it properly. They know that application developers does not expect that they have to resubmit failed upsert. Aside: they are also working on audit features, which presents a number of implementations difficulties that upserts also does. So some time or later, probably not to far away, we will see upserts in postgres. Proper atomic, performant, nice upserts.",1425173180

It&#x27;s great for getting a prototype up and running quickly, but if you&#x27;re planning on building a big production app, a better longer term strategy would be building an express app from good open source components. (ie using sequelize for ORM). As has been mentioned elsewhere the documentation isn&#x27;t always consistent and you sometimes find that a waterline function in the documentation has been deprecated in the current stable version, so be prepared to get to know the source well.

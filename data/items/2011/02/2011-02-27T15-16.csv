You aren't going to improve from there, and you won't learn anything new (though there's <i>always</i> more to learn, in any field).<p>The harsh self-critique just means that your skills still don't measure up to your taste, and if you find yourself doing great without much trouble, that just means you have really poor taste.",1298822230

What really makes a difference is the specific gear you use (mics, preamps, processors, a/d converters, clocks, etc.).<p>Debating the numbers without discussing the signal chain is somewhat ridiculous. A fantastic (great gear) 16/44 chain will sound a lot better than a crappy 24/192 chain. The concept of a signal chain ""only being as strong as the weakest link"" is of great importance.<p>That is only the tracking side of the equation. Eventually, individual tracks get mixed down. Your summing bus is the flip side, and there is a lengthy debate over mixing in the box (digital summing) vs. analog summing, which can be done with a traditional mixing console, or with the recently invented category of gear known as ""summing boxes.""

I think one of the difficulties in US schools is brought up by the author--we try to teach everyone and we believe in 2nd and 3rd chances.  Many countries begin tracking rather early, so their teachers don't have some of the same special needs issues (I'm not arguing right or wrong here, just fact) that teachers here face.<p>Then, there is the family component. In a number of industrialized countries, education is highly prized and parents are deeply involved in their kids' education.  Here, that is again not necessarily the case in many schools--and there is a limit to how much teachers can do to overcome that.<p>Also, I think that in many other industrialized countries, teachers are respected and paid reasonably compared to other professions.

After the presentation, one of the designers (who apparently already knew about Git) stood up and criticized the presenter for not going deeper into branches and auto-branching.<p>Of course, the presenter intentionally left that topic out, in order to not confuse all those Git newbies.<p>However, the designer argued that this is what would make Git interesting for designers. He said that all this diff/commit/push/pull stuff was boring for designers where a ""diff"" between graphics files is neither readable nor meaningful, and where automatic merges are impossible anyway. But branching has the power to reflect the natural work-flow of a designer who permanently goes back to previous versions in order to try different variants. Reflecting this via ""Save as ..."" (and naming files accordingly) is very cumbersome.<p>Although I personally think this guy overrated the power of branches, this might change once the Git user interfaces becomes simpler to use, more targeted to designers (rather than just software developers) and better integrated into graphical tools like Gimp, Inkscape or even Photoshop.",1298821458

They wrote excellent code, and I was really glad they were on the team since they were part of a very small group of guys who seemed to be the only ones who knew what was going on in terms of our code and the direction it was going in.<p>But they were extremely intimidating to be around. Don't get me wrong, they were very nice guys, but their seemingly immense intellect was scary and humiliating. I regularly felt like a dumbass -- and I was the only one there with a PhD (in astrophysics, no less).<p>Over time, I saw that these two guys regularly got caught up in the minutia of some abstract aspect of a problem, so much so that they became annoying to have around, and were somewhat of a hindrance in the decision-making process. I was surprised to discover that I wasn't the only one to have noticed this. I also noticed that neither of these guys never really seemed to produce anything huge out of their massive intellects, and most of the big jobs were tackled over a long period of time, with a lot of comparatively ""dumb"" guys doing most of the work.<p>Everybody does have their flaws.<p>I suppose what could be taken away from this observation is that you shouldn't waste time comparing yourself to the ""genius"" types. Don't put yourself down because you're not as quick or as all-knowing as someone else. What matters more is that you get stuff done, and that you always desire to improve yourself AND work towards that end. You may not become ""all-knowing"" or develop a huge recall ability, but the other skills that you do possess will get better and better, and you'll be worth more than the motor mouth ""geniuses"" whose ability to talk outshadows their ability to get stuff done.",1298821086

In the early days, all code looked like crap to me.  I thought I could do so much better, and in some cases I could.  But when I finally got to building my own systems, I ran into lots of compromises and loose ends - sometimes unavoidably.  And under the pressure of deadlines, I can't say that I always documented clearly from whence came my spaghetti.<p>I've gained a certain respect for a system that _works_, no matter how ugly.  Only time can shake most of the bugs out, and once they're gone, you try not to put any back in.

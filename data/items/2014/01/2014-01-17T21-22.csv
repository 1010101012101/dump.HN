I had a couple of different pre-ipod mp3 players, including the original 32MB Rio, and the iPod was excellent.  The major thing was the cool design, simple use, and their huge storage capability at the time.  The thing that sucked was always iTunes, and the price.  Everything else about it was fantastic, including the sound quality.<p>Yes, their marketing was brilliant, but it won&#x27;t cause people to buy things they don&#x27;t want in perpetuity.

The human body temperature is ~100F by coincidence, not by design.<p>The Fahrenheit scale has 180 divisions (nice round number, evenly divisible by loads of integers) between the freezing point of water and the boiling point of water (212F-32F=180, for the math challenged).  The 0F point is the equilibrium point of a frigorific mixture of equal parts ammonium chloride, ice, and water.  One can easily produce two reference points for the F scale in a way that <i>isn&#x27;t</i> sensitive to the local pressure using just ice brine (0F) and ice water (32F).  The melting temperature of ice and the equilibrium temperature of the brine mixture are constant on the pressure scales and temperature scales available to metrologists before about the 19th century[1][2].<p>The same can&#x27;t be said for the Celsius scale, which requires either a triple-point cell or a known atmospheric pressure (so that the boiling temperature of water is well-known).<p>Edit: So the close out the point, the Fahrenheit is a unit which is much better matched for the calibration tools and computational methods available around the time it was invented.<p>[1] Maybe a better way to state this sentence is that the temperatures are constant &quot;to within the experimental uncertainty achievable at the time.&quot;<p>[2] It&#x27;s well known to anyone who has ever cooked that water boils at an appreciably different temperature in Denver than in Los Angeles.",1389995324
7078648,comment,7077896,7077896,8,0,tokenadult,,,"&quot;A mutation in the gene that is thought to affect red blood cell production was present in only 9% of the Han population, but was found in 87% of the Tibetan population.&quot;<p>Okay, so according to the news article kindly submitted here, the gene pattern is not invariant in the Tibetan population, nor is it absent from the non-Tibetan population. And this is what we would expect from hundreds of previous studies of human genetics--there is genetic variation within each geographically defined human population, even when the populations are under very strong selection pressure (as here, for this trait). And note too the &quot;thought to affect red blood cell production,&quot; as gene mechanisms are still generally very poorly understood.<p>Way back in the 1970s, I had a student part-time job in the medical school of the University of Minnesota, and one of the physician-professors there then was writing grant applications to try to get to Tibet to study high-altitude adaptations that were presumed to be present in populations that had lived on the high Tibetan Plateau since thousands of years ago. It has taken a long time even to confirm that hypothesis, but already we see that some Tibetans live at high altitude, as their ancestors have for a long time, WITHOUT those gene adaptations. Individual human adaptability is amazing, in many ways even more amazing than the selection pressure on gene assemblages that gives me my white skin (the ancestral human condition was surely dark skin). Human beings can climb Mount Everest without bottled oxygen (please don&#x27;t try this at home) and humans from whatever ancestral region can live in whatever other region of the world, perhaps in discomfort, but can grow and reproduce there. Human adaptability is quite amazing.<p>AFTER EDIT: To answer a question I was asked,<p><i>Are you pushing in the direction of &quot;Tibetans are indistinguishable from Chinese and Tibet is China&quot;?</i><p>No, my answer was not political. (I don&#x27;t have a Free Tibet bumper sticker on my car, as many of the drivers in this state do, but I&#x27;m generally sympathetic with that point of view as to the national sovereignty of historical Tibet, which includes a lot more territory than the current Tibet Autonomous Territory administered by the P.R.C. regime in China.) My statement is biological and VERY general--every genetic study of every geographically defined population in every part of the world finds gene variation in that population, and many of the gene variants found are known to occur in other populations.

A long-time TI employee I used to work with told me TI started doing this for overhead reasons.  TI has a large number of fabs, assembly areas, and buildings that are basically high ceiling, wide open flex space.  These areas all have to be heated or cooled as a whole, and the cost isn&#x27;t much different if you have 2000 people in the building or 200.  Somebody in corporate figured out that the company could actually save money by just giving everyone the days off and shutting down all the equipment instead of trying to get things done short-staffed.

For those running statups, here&#x27;s why I joined, what didn&#x27;t matter and why I left:<p>WHY I JOINED<p>1. Lack of bureaucracy.  Granted, I worked at an exceptionally bureaucratic bank, but I longed for a place where I could just <i>do</i> something without having 10 meetings to ask permission from people who weren&#x27;t qualified to decide if the project was valid or not.  Projects that could have taken months took years.<p>2. Benefits.  The startup not only paid 100% of my health insurance premium, they offered great insurance.  That&#x27;s a big deal in the USA.  I had a child who had a hospital stay.  It cost me $100 out of pocket and would have cost tens of thousands otherwise.  It was like having thousands of dollars added to my salary.<p>3. Relocation.  They paid for movers to pack and ship my goods directly.  I didn&#x27;t have to mess with reimbursement or advances.  If you&#x27;re looking to get the best you can find from across the country, this can be a big deal.<p>3. A new language/challenge.  I had started writing code in Python and loved it.  It was a refreshing change.<p>4. Smart people.  I can honestly say that the startup I worked for had the smartest staff of any place I&#x27;ve worked.  It was intimidating at times, but I learned a lot in a very short period of time.  I ended up touching a lot of parts of the system that I didn&#x27;t have much experience with and it was a huge learning experience that will benefit me for the rest of my career.<p>5. Great hardware.  I felt like I finally had enough horsepower on my development machine to actually do my job.  The default was a well-equipped Mac, but other developers could choose what they needed.<p>6. A great location.  This is less important, but was an attention-getter when they made me their initial pitch.  Santa Monica, across the street from the beach/pier.  I&#x27;m not sure how it could have gotten better.<p>WHAT DIDN&#x27;T MATTER<p>1. The salary.  I actually took a pay <i>cut</i> if you factor in the cost of living.  I don&#x27;t regret that decision.<p>2. Foosball table.  Some people liked playing on a break during some very long hours, but I honestly just didn&#x27;t get it.<p>2. Free food.  They went all-out with the snacks and didn&#x27;t hesitate to order-in food on our frequent late-nighters.  I got fat.<p>WHY I LEFT<p>1.  The hours got way out of control.  I knew there would be overtime, but it became far beyond what I could sustain.  The startup went through a tight spot and we all pitched in to rebuild the site three times in less than a year.  I&#x27;ve heard that the hours have leveled off and sometimes wonder if I shouldn&#x27;t have stayed.<p>TL;DR: Hire the best, give them the tools and environment to get their job done.  Make relocation a no-brainer and health insurance (in the US, at least) best-in-class.  Make salary competitive, but don&#x27;t get in a bidding war with other companies.  Offer the best location you can, and above all, don&#x27;t burn people out.",1389994363

I often find meetups and conferences can be hit-and-miss (though a developer conference may be more useful!), but I agree that connecting with people is good.<p>In the thread on consulting a few days ago a great point came up: if you can translate your skills into value to a business, you might end up having conversations with people they didn&#x27;t know they wanted to have. An example: you can go to a tech meetup and pitch yourself as a full-stack Rails developer, and try to get work from people who know they need Rails developers -- or you can go to a finance meetup and pitch yourself as a solutions builder, and end up getting 10x the revenue from a project that&#x27;s turning a spreadsheet pipeline into a CRUD app.<p>My take on networking, and what&#x27;s been working for me, is to reach out through people you already know. They might not be hiring your skillset, but they might need a solution to a problem. Almost all of the work I&#x27;ve been doing lately has come through intros, and several of those started off as fairly cold relationships. For example, I applied to a startup incubator, whose founder decided I was smart but too early in my idea, so hooked me up with another founder who needed some heavy lifting done on the Android side. Other projects have come through more direct referrals, but almost all have been for startups who are flexible on parameters (including time, remote, etc) and who don&#x27;t even have websites, let alone job ads.",1389993727

Because skilled developers know that once you have built a CRUD app a half dozen times, the work is simple and straightforward with no challenge. This work is called crud work because it is not very desirable by people who look for challenges.<p>On the other hand, it is easy to build these CRUD apps 10 times faster than a developer who has not learned all the ins and outs of such work. CRUD apps happen to be highly useful in most companies, i.e. there is a lot of market demand. Some people like this kind of work just like some people like to work on an assembly line. And it may even be worthwhile to  pay someone a higher salary to churn out apps like this.<p>But that does not make someone a 10x engineer. It just means that they happen to be working in a 10x environment right now. Next year they may be struggling to keep up with iOS developers who are all on their 3rd iOS app.<p>My takeaway is that if a company really needs and wants 10x engineers, they should advertise the narrow details of the job that needs to be done and avoid listing irrelevant stuff like education and all the technologies involved. The ad should say something like Ruby on Rails for over 3 years with at least 10 apps built using MySQL backends.<p>But if you need someone who is creative, can adapt to change and new technology, has experience with certain generic technologies like async servers, then please say that in so many words. And pay them more than average.<p>Because the majority of developers are average developers and they share some characteristics. They have been working with more than one kind of technology. They are good at learning new things. They know how to adapt to new tools and new business requirements. They have used some stuff in the past, but because they have no desire to become 10x well-paid developers using that exact same set of technology, you should not be judging them by matching up lists of acronyms and names.",1389992973

7078398,comment,7077234,7077670,7,0,bigtunacan,,,"drew here has it right. While it is possible to find money on side projects in more mainstream technologies like Java or .NET; it is easier in specialized fields.<p>Depending on where you are targeting geographically those technologies vary a lot; I personally have seen a lot of demand for iOS/Android, but even more demand for Ruby on Rails.  I think that quite a few Ruby on Rails developers left the community and flocked to Node.js as the next shiny thing and that has just made it easier to find Rails contract work.<p>Not only is it easier to find work in a less mainstream technology, but you are able to negotiate better rates since it is more difficult for businesses to locate help. After a certain point you can&#x27;t scale by taking on additional hours; so your hourly rate makes a big difference.<p>And hourly vs fixed rate contracting should be considered. I will negotiate my hourly rate based on term of contract, but under no circumstances will I take fixed rate contracts any longer. Quite a few of my friends in the contracting scene are the same way. I&#x27;ve seen too many times where this just leads to continual &quot;feature creep&quot; and a strong difference in opinions of if scope of work has been expanded beyond the agreed contract (in all cases it was).  I bid a fixed rate contract with a couple of associates against my better judgement. Based on the initial scope of work it should have taken about 3 months. Instead it took over a year and the lead developer on the project walked away making a rate of right around $10/hour.<p>And this point can not be overstated.<p>Network! Network! Network!<p>If you are an introvert you are going to have to get over it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have the raw programming skills of Linus Torvalds or John Carmack; if you can&#x27;t get out there and make connections you aren&#x27;t going to make any money.<p>I am very introverted by nature, but I force myself to regularly attend meetups and conferences; and make a point to connect with new people at those conferences. You need to grow your real social graph; not your Facebook/LinkedIn/etc... Nothing makes the same lasting impression as a firm handshake and 5 minutes of conversation face to face.",1389992755

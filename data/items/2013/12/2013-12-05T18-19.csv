To the author: WELL DONE.<p>The jumps between real mode, v8086/protected mode, and long mode are absolutely mind boggling.<p>Here&#x27;s the best part that I remember from implementing Intel VMX support in a VMM: once you&#x27;ve booted the VMM and are ready to do a VMXON to load a guest, you will realize  you have a problem. Specifically, Intel realized a while ago that &quot;real mode&quot; sucks and is obviously not the &quot;real mode&quot; that actual applications expect to run in, so they introduced v8086 mode in addition to real mode.<p>The problem, of course, is that booting an OS still requires real mode, <i>but you can&#x27;t run a guest in VMX in real mode, only v8086 mode.</i> But all those things that Intel &quot;fixed&quot; in v8086 mode? Yeah they will totally keep you from booting.<p>So you&#x27;re chugging along in v8086 and your guest does something that it should absolutely be able to do and BOOM -- you&#x27;ve faulted.

Science does this.<p>There is a cost for everything. If you have a disease that isn&#x27;t causing any symptoms, do you treat it, even though it will probably never cause symptoms? There is a risk in all treatments, some more than others. There is a study that most prostate cancers don&#x27;t show symptoms, ever and our super sensitive cancer diagnostics tests are causing more harm than good. More diagnostics does not mean more good. That&#x27;s why we no longer do the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test. It finds too many cancers that aren&#x27;t going to cause harm and then people get unneeded treatment that causes side effects.

The poor person who receives a government payout does benefit immediately, but poor people would benefit in the long term if that money had been invested in a job (and wealth) creating venture.  This seems to me a difficult trade-off, and not a clear argument for or against welfare; my criticism of your argument here is that you presuppose an unlikely counter-factual.<p>You say &quot;the poor are much more likely to actually spend that money than the rich are&quot;, but there is no evidence for the idea that poor people are less likely to hoard wealth than the rich.  Rich individuals allocate their wealth to longer-term investments, whereas poorer people spend their money on consumption goods; both of these allocation systems allow the money to circulate in the economy.

6856274,comment,6824061,6826447,1,0,bmelton,,,"Having done it, I can attest that it is indeed very hard to work a government contract to completion, coming in on time and on budget.  It isn&#x27;t impossible, but it is indeed very, very hard, and the general inclination is to fail, through no fault of the contractor.<p>Government workers have interesting employment metrics.  They are, for lack of a more profound term, extremely risk averse.  If you, as a contractor, propose a new solution to an existing problem, you are looked at like a watch practitioner, or perhaps a voodoo doctor.  All claims are treated with a level of skepticism that can only be described as paranoia and sadly, given the general trend on government projects, that isn&#x27;t necessarily unwarranted.<p>Building a website to service a total user base of 30,000 users is, for most of us I&#x27;m sure, pretty easy.  That&#x27;s not exactly a difficult scaling target to hit, and could easily be done on commodity hardware.  However, in implementing something similar, I was forced to order 4 Sun Fire boxes, at a cost of over $10k each, to mitigate concerns of speed.<p>Certificate based SSL is also very easy, but we were coerced into purchasing a dedicated SSL module to offload SSL handling to hardware, to mitigate concerns of security, which were then compounded by anecdotal experience that &quot;ssl is slow&quot;.  So, not only did we have to implement SSL-only for a site with absolutely no public facing endpoint, we had to do so with hardware crypto, that we had to hustle to learn at the last minute -- all reasonable sounding objectives, but compounded with the notion that the contract was a firm-fixed price, bid with different hardware and software SSL, and you can see where the project was trending towards either failure, or a lawsuit after an overrun.<p>The phases of a government contract too, are curious.  It starts with skepticism, in which everybody wants the project to die before implementation because its public failure would make everybody look bad, then, if it&#x27;s somehow able to assuage enough fears to get a go-ahead, you&#x27;re generally assigned a COTR (Contracts Officer) that ostensibly wants the project to succeed, but would happily wager a failure before implementation than a bigger failure post-implementation.<p>Assuming you can get to the point of actually convincing somebody that the project might actually succeed, and then it might actually deliver good results, the exact opposite happens -- EVERYBODY wants to become a stakeholder, so that they can have their names attached to the success.  This has its own faults, because now everybody wants to put their stamp on the project -- which means week-long meetings with various groups of stakeholders all arguing over what image should be used in the page header -- I&#x27;ve had day-long meetings in which the only topic of discussion was &quot;In the picture of the building, the summer photos have too many leaves on the trees, and we can&#x27;t see the building, but in the winter photos, there are too few leaves, making the scenery look dead... how do we fix this?&quot;<p>Assuming your project hasn&#x27;t failed yet, you get to a point where now, all the other contractors in the building hate you, and want you to fail.  In a normal business, that would never be an issue -- but in the government, the DNS changes are handled by company A, while the active directory is managed by company B.  You&#x27;re sitting there, company C that you are, requesting changes from company A and company B -- both of which will happily obey the exact letter of every request, so that they can indicate full compliance, but which are happy to interpret those letters in such a way that set you up for failure, so that if the project is at this point, you&#x27;ve gotten to the level where the <i>idea</i> is sold, and failure can be blamed on the contractor -- YOU! This means that if it fails, Company A and Company B will swoop in with the exact same idea, only they&#x27;ll offer their superior experience and intimate knowledge of the project, its failures, and the existing infrastructure to why the project will succeed in their hands.<p>This should be a blog post -- I&#x27;ll shut up now.",1386269373

Its worth thinking through the causal chain of how your work is used as an engineer, even if you conclude that you are not the proximate cause and therefore do not bear responsibility.<p>I live in the Delaware Valley, an area of the country devastated by engineers. Engineers built communications and automation technology, which has allowed executives to outsource and eliminate jobs far more quickly than people here can get trained for new ones. The human toll of these changes has been higher than drone and surveillance technology combined.<p>Are engineers working in communications and automation the proximate cause of these changes? Maybe or maybe not. But how long or short is the chain of causation? I think its not very deep, not when an automation company might market its technology by mentioning the labor cost savings.

I&#x27;m in the camp that it&#x27;s reasonable to want at least some semblance of equality of outcome though, so this argument resonates with me in a way that it might not to someone who favors a more lassez-faire approach. This probably falls under your &quot;moral need&quot; umbrella.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with your statement about a progressive income tax being economically unjustifiable, especially in the economy that we find ourselves in at the moment (and, if secular stagnation proponents like Larry Summers and Paul Krugman are right, may be the structural norm these days). The current economy is strongly demand constrained, with plenty of money available for investment (corporate profits and cash holdings at record highs), but inadequate consumer demand to justify investments. From this perspective, a progressive transfer of wealth down the income scale makes a lot of sense economically because the poor are much more likely to actually spend that money than the rich are. There&#x27;s also not much good evidence that high end tax rates affect macroeconomic growth as much as people claim - just in the US we&#x27;ve had tax rates all over the map over the past 100 years, and there&#x27;s not much correlation with economic growth. We certainly haven&#x27;t seen any miracles of economic growth for the economy as a whole since 1980 with the long running supply side, deregulation, and low tax experiment. If taxing the rich really has such a strong effect on economic growth and job creation, it&#x27;s hard to see that in the data...<p>Finally, interest on government debt only becomes a long-term problem if the rate is higher than the rate of growth.

ABSOLUTELY</i><p>Initially at least, Zyklon B was an entirely legitimate pesticide/vermicide that had a broad range of uses. The original form contained a powerful warning odorant to alert users of its presence in sub-lethal concentrations.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any claim that the actual production staff knew exactly where or how it was being used, and so would have no real grounds to refuse or quit.  There is evidence that once it was found suitable for killing humans, there was a change in formulation to remove the warning odorant at the direct request of the extermination camp officials.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that alone would be grounds for staff suspicion, as it was apparently passed off as necessity due to wartime material shortages, which to me would seem plausible.<p>The production and distributor firms management, however, knew a lot more about what was going on, and where it was being used.  Founder Tesch & director Weinbacher were both found guilty in a war-crimes tribunal[1], whilst another employee was acquitted.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite so simple a scenario as &#x27;the process engineer for the pesticide vats should have guessed they might be being misused and quit just in case&#x27; that you lay out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/zyklonb.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/zyklonb.htm</a>",1386268321

In the long term, interest will either gradually take over the entire government budget, or an interest rate increase will force the government to default; in either case, borrowing to finance regular spending will eventually fail as a policy.<p>The &#x27;inflation argument&#x27; against welfare policies is flawed as you point out, because it has never been demonstrated that wage increases cause inflation (so called &quot;demand-pull inflation&quot;).  Whether or not some type of government welfare program should exist is an interesting question, and your answer seems to presuppose that the counter-factual is that there would be no social assistance program at all, whereas I would think that private charities would do a better job than the government, while avoiding coercion.

While I got it rendering 3D planets after some work (where I basically had to implement manual rendering code anyway, since the engine didn&#x27;t support the odd use-case of spherical terrain), contorting it to support massive coordinate spaces, huge view ranges, dynamic loading/unloading etc. was just far too messy to even hope to attempt in that engine.<p>After several attempts to cleanly implement a space-scale engine as an extension of an existing engine, I started over from scratch using pure OpenGL (WebGL). And this time, I managed to keep the code reasonably tidy while supporting trillions of stars, planets etc. as I had originally planned [1].<p>Would I have been able to do the same thing in OGRE if I kept trying?

6855932,comment,6854863,6854863,29,0,grellas,,,"Evil behavior, however precisely defined, has been and always will be with us. Technology enhances what we do as human beings and, hence, always has the potential to be applied to ill uses. If someone, then, takes what you develop and applies it for a purpose you never intended in creating it, that is an item beyond your control. Alan Turing - who applied his genius to confer what can only be called immeasurable benefits on society and who used his skills to crack Nazi codes to help end a terrible war - is <i>not</i> ethically responsible for the many consequences inevitably brought into the world simply because computing power can be used to magnify the effects of human evil. Was he (or is any other engineer whose technology is misused) a causal agent in the various bad outcomes we can identify in, for example, the enhanced lethality of weaponry or in the massive spying by governments on their citizenry? In a narrow sense, perhaps yes. When one traces things back up a causal chain, one can theoretically identify every individual actor who made technical innovations that culminated ultimately in a particular bad use of whatever type that afflicts us today. But, though a cause-in-fact, Mr. Turing (and the many engineers who followed him respecting any given facet of computing technology) is not what the lawyers call the &quot;proximate cause&quot; - that is, the immediately enabling agent - of the outcome. Meaning, if you deem it unethical to build bombs, then don&#x27;t do work for a defense contractor helping to build bombs because your every innovation will be immediately applied to a use you deem unethical. The same for working for NSA in developing sophisticated spying technology. Or for whatever other ill use you can identify in society. But, beyond avoiding direct conduct by which you are proximately helping to cause an outcome you deem wrong, you as a technologist basically have no control over how your work may be applied by others and, as the collective results of such work eventually permeate society, your moral responsibility for the indirect results of your work effectively stand at zero. If the operative standard were otherwise, then all innovation would stand frozen altogether because it is always possible to conceive of an ill use for any technology that makes things faster, more powerful, more efficient, etc. Put any such thing into the hands of human actors and <i>some</i> bad results are guaranteed to follow given enough time and opportunity. Thus, unless one is to freeze all productive activity or is to go insane second-guessing how others might pervert that which is being done for good, engineers must perforce ignore tangential ethical implications over which they have no effective control.<p>I think it is fair to say that each of us in our given professions (mine being law) ought to avoid being a proximate cause of something deemed wrong even though technically legal (for example, I would not be a &quot;mob lawyer&quot; even though there are some technically very good lawyers who do that work). But even here that is an individual choice for each actor to make. For engineers, some may see it as a great opportunity to do advanced work in some of the social media companies while others may regard such companies as being engaged in unethical conduct as they at least sometimes use dubious techniques to try corral us as consumers into their tight little worlds. For any given engineer, working for such a company doing such things is a matter of conscience. Some may say yes, others no. The same is true in working for a defense contractor or for the government. Or for any other work that is legal but ethically suspect in the eyes of some but not others. It is your choice and it is your conscience.<p>The author of this piece reflects what I call the bane of associational thinking. He uses the royal &quot;we&quot; to define a group (here, engineers) and then prescribes very broad goals for what &quot;we&quot; &quot;ought&quot; to do. Since all the things described now stand as a matter of private choice over which the &quot;we&quot; group as a whole has no say, then the only way to translate this sort of thing into practical action is to form formal associations, assign things to committees, and then issue a series of prescriptions on what the group members ought to do. That may be fine in terms of the association giving rules that amount to exhortations to do good (who would disagree with that). But, beyond that, do you really want an organized association dictating what today stand as your private choices for your career? Or, worse, do you want such an association to lobby governments to adopt their strictures and give them the force of law? I would think not. How, then, can &quot;we&quot; do better? Of course, the question is always described as difficult and is left for further discussion precisely because it has no real answer apart from acting on individual conscience or apart from the potentially coercive ones of letting some association or government dictate your career choices and opportunities. Perhaps this sort of reasoning is justified as encouraging people to have a heightened conscience about what they do, and in that respect it is fine. But that is really as far as it goes before veering into unacceptable alternatives.<p>Our capacity to do wrong is innate to our nature, as is our capacity to do good. We should not stop trying to do good through our creativity just because others can take what we do and commit wrongs with it. Nor should we feel guilty about what we do as long as we in good conscience can say to ourselves that we are doing something productive and worthwhile and not directly causing harm to others. The &quot;we&quot; issue is in reality much more of an &quot;I&quot; issue and, for that, you should examine what you do carefully and strive for the good regardless of what others may do with it. If you want to exhort others to do better by your standards, then all the better. Just don&#x27;t dictate to them on matters over which people in good conscience may disagree.",1386266744

Most people will consider me an idealist (or a lunatic, if other commenters are to be believed), but I believe that we are on the verge of an unprecedented explosion of commercial innovation.  Consider how long it took for the internet to filter from early adopters to the mainstream, and compare that to the growth of the bitcoin network.

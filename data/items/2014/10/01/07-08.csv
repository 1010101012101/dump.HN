When this happens, the original instance can export environment variables and function definitions into the new instance.[16] Function definitions are exported by encoding them within the environment variable list as variables whose values begin with parentheses (&quot;()&quot;) followed by a function definition. The new instance of Bash, upon starting, scans its environment variable list for values in this format and converts them back into internal functions.</i><p>I had this strange feeling after reading this, that it&#x27;s been long time since people worked with low-level code. It&#x27;s like the difference between method dispatch in C++ and, say, Python. In the latter, it&#x27;s magic, it works and you don&#x27;t care. In the former, it&#x27;s part of basic language knowledge to understand how virtual methods are implemented by a hack involving pointers to arrays of function pointers (aka. vtables).",1412150131

The significance is that there are many more existing, free Java applications than exist on the IPhone and IPad today.

And the author avoids to consider what the JIT does. JIT means that effectively, at the end, the JIT engine produced the <i>native code.</i> The same code your real compiler would produce. All the processing before that phase is just to allow the clumsy &quot;too dynamic&quot; languages to be able to balance between the &quot;do at least something&quot; and &quot;do something fast enough&quot; (the second happens after the &quot;tracing&quot; code detects something is repated often enough. And the code that is actually important has to be run as often as it can).<p>But if you write the code that is from the start less &quot;dynamic,&quot; you can get the quality code without all the engines in between and all the overheads that are incurred.<p>The &quot;asmjs&quot; achieves the speed because it is a protocol which allows the JIT to simply compile the whole big chunk of program to the native code at once, without all the tracing etc. And to have such a code at the first place, you need some less dynamic language, like C, as the source.<p>On another side, the programmers don&#x27;t like to have to be &quot;too specific&quot; but  recently more languages that gain popularity demonstrate that the types can often be inferred in the compilation phase and that such a code can be convenient enough for a lot of developers but fast too.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t think that the future is in PyPy. It exists only because the Python language &quot;specification&quot; (and the reference implementation) is too clumsy to allow clearer type inference. In my opinion, the future is in the type inference and the real compilation, not the clumsy-big-overhead virtual machines. Obviously, the developments that actually move in the direction I like are obviously: asmjs, Swift and Rust. Disclaimer: I know I&#x27;m biased in preferring, whenever possible, the compiled code to the interpreted or the JIT-ed. YMMW.",1412148728

8393217,comment,8389728,8389728,2,0,c3d,,,"A lot of the discussion here has been around Lua, but not around what they do with it.<p>I think that putting yet another language and runtime in the OS kernel is a bad idea. It makes the amount of code to validate much bigger. I much prefer the Mill Computing approach to security, where &quot;everybody works the same&quot; including the kernel (see <a href=""http://millcomputing.com/docs/security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://millcomputing.com/docs/security/</a> if you have not seen it already). That&#x27;s also the idea behind many microkernels.<p>Although the Mill CPU embeds basic mechanisms in the hardware to make it easier, I believe this could be achieved on modern x86 or ARM as well with reasonable performance. You don&#x27;t need privileged instructions to deal with packet routing or CPU throttling, you only need controlled memory access to specific regions of memory (e.g. device registers, buffers, etc). I see no reason why the scripts could not do their work from user-space, with kernel-controlled access to the regions of memory they need to operate. And the overhead in doing that is practically zero (basically, it&#x27;s the cost of the TLB translations, which is paid for every single memory access anyway).<p>Obviously, you also need inter-process and inter-CPU synchro, interrupt handling, etc. But all these are already presented in a virtualised form to user-space.<p>Also, if you want the flexibility of a scripting language, you are willing to forego quite a bit of performance in the process. Is the cost of a user-kernel transition really that relevant in this scenario? And if it is, there are mechanisms to mitigate that cost, e.g. pooling requests, deferring, sending to another CPU, etc.<p>I&#x27;m a bit appalled by the way they measure the overhead (Section 5 of the article). They say that their CPU rethrottling code runs in &quot;only&quot; 8 microseconds. Well, if compared to the rescheduling interval, it may seem small, 8 microseconds in kernel code is actually a lot. It means 1/125 of a regular millisecond tick. All this just to change the frequency of the CPU?<p>In short, I agree with the objectives (making the OS more extensible and more flexible), but the way they did it seems dangerous and under-optimal.",1412148532

Reactions serve as an &quot;alert&quot;, triggering responses, arousing attention, motivating problem-solving and accordingly, reasoned action.  However, in an emergency (e.g., a distinct threat), emotional reactions can be translated directly to action as in &quot;fight or flight&quot; activation.<p>Emotionality becomes problematic when emotional information is not adequately integrated with cognition/rational processing.  If a person can&#x27;t reason about emotion, reactions are more likely to &quot;take over&quot;, and &quot;primitive&quot; (aggressive, &quot;overly emotional&quot;) behaviors occur.<p>&quot;Dysrationalia&quot; or failure of logical thought or problem-solving is too general a phenomenon to have diagnostic specificity.

You chose your degree, you get to choose your classes, and for the core requirements, if the school is decent, you at least have the option of waiting to take it with a different teacher if they are that intolerable.<p>The ability to do tough work that you might not necessarily enjoy but must be done and do that consistently without stopping is exactly the reason companies require them. Of course they also want good talent that will contribute and make them more successful, but a large part of joining a company at first is training on menial tasks, working full time, and working well with others. It doesn&#x27;t so much require that you have knowledge/skill, just the ability to learn the way the company does things, be absorbed into the culture, and be manageable. This also only gets you the smallest salary in the company, but it at least gets you your foot in the door so you can BE mentored and learn from others, just like you are supposed to be learning from your teachers/peers.<p>Many talented and driven people don&#x27;t need that. They can find something that can make money and learn about how to accomplish that all on their own. However, although I am NOT one of those people, I assume that it is a rough road to take by depending solely on this talent. If you can tolerate getting a degree and showing that you can be obedient, you can make it a lot easier on yourself to gain more knowledge, talent, and resources by getting into a company easily.

It just means you won&#x27;t be extra-lucky in finding coworkers of high emotional ability.<p>Personally, I think that focusing on work performance is a refreshing wind against so much folk wisdom hiring.<p>I&#x27;m also not at all surprised that someone was unable to unseat intelligence as a predictor of work performance. That predictor has been solidly established as powerful across a general array of work (better than past relevant work experience!), and scientists are ever on the hunt for a better employment sieve.",1412147293

I did not find an MBA to be particularly helpful in understanding customer behavior, but it&#x27;s definitely valuable in understanding government and corporate behavior.<p>And yes, it&#x27;ll help you understand supply chains/logistics, various process and people optimizations, etc. Think of it like learning algorithms and patterns for solving problems that are commonly found in large human organizations.<p>> Or is it truly impossible to walk into today&#x27;s MBA programs wanting to study business as theoretical and societal constructs, without walking out a professional networker and middle manager?<p>It&#x27;s a degree. Nothing more. However, I would not get an MBA with a goal of middle management as the focus of most programs is on getting you ready for upper management decision making.

8393177,comment,8391804,8392888,1,0,sbisker,,,"I have to disagree here. Folks with failed startups are as diverse as the startups they built (or just as often, struggled to build).<p>The simple reason why is because while a startup is the best place to learn how to start a startup, it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> always the best place to learn how to be an engineer.<p>At least, not the sort of robust engineering (hopefully) done at established companies, where you have to understand existing best practices like code style, continuous deployment and testing, and non-technical conventions like proper code reviews and pager schedules. That sort of rigor isn&#x27;t found in all startups, but some amount of it is a necessity when your primary job is shipping code, lots of it, and not just searching for product market fit.<p>I think it is far more likely that you&#x27;ll get a strong offer for a large corp coming out of another large corp - where you&#x27;ll speak the language and have found at least <i>someone</i> talented to mentor you - than as a typical acqui-hire or founder of an also-ran startup. In fact, many acqui-hire employees themselves have to go through interviews at the acquiring company, finding themselves on the bottom of the pecking order at their new companies - if they even have jobs at all.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t do a startup...just, don&#x27;t do it expecting your Plan B to be a cushy job at Facebook. :)",1412146847

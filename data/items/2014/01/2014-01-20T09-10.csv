In such a situation, the boy will suppress a smile while he innocently exclaims he made a typo, while his friends all giggle innocuously. If you don&#x27;t work with kids, you will not fully understand how the adolescent mind manifests itself in the classroom environment, and how difficult it is to suppress it.

Girls simply don&#x27;t find stupidity that funny, and as an instructor I get pretty sick and tired of it.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last 30 minutes defending myself on HN so I will conclude with this. We are not segregating our classes. We are not trying to shield female students from the realities of the world. We are simply making a business decision to offer an alternative environment for our female students who would otherwise have to deal with awkward situations like the one I just described.

I followed Pidgin&#x27;s devel mailing list for a while. For some reason, when they switched away from SVN several years ago they switched to a very niche DVCS called monotone which, among other oddities, had such a large data format/slow clone process that they had a tarball of the database for download that you had to then use to initialize your local checkout, because actually cloning the database the normal way would take too long. I assume they chose it due to some core developers&#x27; familiarity with it or something. Later, they eventually realized this was a huge barrier to entry for new developers and there was a protracted discussion/flame war about the replacement. One guy in particular, felipec, seemed to spend days writing up long detailed posts about how hg was inferior to git, which were more or less factual, but written in a snarky/condescending tone, and the core developers never took him seriously and made it clear that his input was not welcome. It&#x27;s kind of funny, that guy ended up writing a bunch of hg to git interoperability scripts ostensibly for the sake of proving git&#x27;s superiority, and those are now included in git-contrib.<p>So, yeah, (D)VCS choice is probably a bigger holy war than editor, and getting a project to switch is quite nontrivial. Especially a lot of the projects you&#x27;d want to switch away from some poor DVCS, because they often stick to it for some non-technical reason (eg. bzr seems to be largely a GNU thing).",1390211422

But at the same time I don&#x27;t like when people are calling out initiatives like &quot;more women in tech&quot;. Look, getting a job is tough. It can be luck or qualification. I know someone is going to cite some research studies but at this point, let&#x27;s just say yes we get it, a lot of assholes out there are discriminating women. But in reality, you can&#x27;t stop them by hiring more women. You wish you could just get more women in manager level so that more women can be hired. That&#x27;s not going to happen magically and hoping women managers hire more women is also acting discrimination. I am not comfortable with that kind of initiatives. It is as if I was a broker setting a goal for myself. That&#x27;s just number game, there is nothing we gain from it other than growing the numbers.<p>3. All-girls class is just bad. For one it&#x27;s like containing them, like putting them in a zoo and wait for them to do something amazing and then we pay a visit and cheer them for their accomplishment. Events meant for helping girls to find self-esteem is great but then again, too many is going to do damage because they soon will get attached to these &quot;all-girls&quot; environment. To actually work in the real world, one must accept the flaws and be ready to work with unfriendly people. What is even more frustrating is that we are dogfooding people with the crazy things CS and programming are doing. The ability to code is great, awesome. But coding is just a tool. Like every other tool out there, you can either make something awesome and powerful or something ugly and useless. Knowing how to code doesn&#x27;t make you smarter or special.

And that&#x27;s pretty much stereotyping.<p>What we need is to stop telling girls or any group of people to do XYZ because they are the minority or is having disadvantage. Making exceptions to them isn&#x27;t going to help them. I am Asian (Chinese to be exact) and if 20 years later Asian MD dominates like 80%, do we start another initiative to bring up other ethnicity? If all the ice cream truck drivers are Asians, do we want more diversity? If we think (or because studies have shown...) that girls don&#x27;t end up in tech because they are afraid or because they were told they weren&#x27;t good enough, having all-girl class won&#x27;t solve the problem when they enter the real world either.<p>Teach people about computer and web literacy, about science and engineering, about what people do in their daily jobs. Teach regardless of gender or race. We all deserve to know them and we don&#x27;t need to have special non-profit organizations going after XYZ groups of people. Bring those things into core education.",1390211312

But this has been proven false, at least for audio (which I know better).<p>Some people think they hear left or right by doing some triangulation between the two ears. Nothing more wrong: with only two ear we would not perceive height, and people deaf of one ear certainly do not &quot;hear in 1D&quot;.<p>In fact we localise sound because of<p>- The shape of our ears. (See how complex are the ears of some animals)<p>- Tiny movements of the head.<p>- Past experience (learning) of the shape of reverberation and reflections in common rooms.<p>A full &quot;real&quot; simulation of sound localisation, which has been experimented and works, requires:<p>- Sounds recorded in an anechoic chamber (these are very small and expensive, you won&#x27;t get a philharmonic in it, and playing music in this echo-less room is extremely painful).<p>- Microphone must be perfect, a thing that do not exist.<p>- Synthetic room reflections computed on the fly according to where the listener sits when listening (shape and texture of the room and where are the two ears in the room)<p>- A polar reflection model of the ear shapes of the listener.<p>- An helmet detecting tiny head movements and adjusting all the computation above accordingly.<p>- Perfect earphones inside the ears of the listener.<p>So this all works in theory and has been tested experimentally, but it has not crossed anyone&#x27;s mind that we really need this to enjoy a properly spatialized concerto. We can approximate a soundscape enough with the very crude left-right localization provided by stereophony, and this is quite enough to enjoy good music.<p>It is certainly different for the visual field, but I would bet it will be ressembling in the big strokes: music, movies, books, painting, all these create <i>illusions</i>, automomous worlds that do not need to match reality perfectly.

For everyone else debating this issue: to look at the problem objectively, we have to break down the different clusters of people that need encouragement and support to get into tech/startups in order to see how we measure and fix each cluster:<p>1. American children of any affiliation (race, sex, gender, location) need to learn how to code, because it is the literacy of the future - without it you are left behind in both earnings potential and career choices. To make that happen everyone here can take a step to show a child something cool they can do with code. Get them fired up about expressing their creativity with the tools of tech! For every one child that reminds you of you when you were young, pick three that don&#x27;t, to make things even in the long run.<p>2. Niche groups, previously underrepresented in tech need better representation, because diverse perspectives raise the permutation of potential problems noticed, problems tackled and solutions possible, period. Representation also leads to better mentorship, resources, and an even start for everyone with talent and grit, regardless of background. Once we get a unicorn IPO from each underrepresented group, things will change. If we aren&#x27;t getting those, something is wrong with 1) or 3) or both.<p>3. Existing representatives of underrepresented groups in tech who have the experience and skills to lead and build successful businesses today need to be able to receive the same support and the same proportion of support as regularly represented groups. Nothing more, nothing less. We have yet to see data from anyone about percentage of seed* funded startups out of 1000 applicants from their representative group. That data can easily close this conversation for good or surface a problem that can be addressed next if need be. If there is a real problem here however, teaching children how to code won&#x27;t be the way we need to solve it. This is the only data we have seen and it is not encouraging: <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/11/02/how-female-entrepreneurs-can-get-venture-capital-game/Ahn0XfhG3WABm8Q4uoAq6O/story.html?event=event12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bostonglobe.com/magazine/2013/11/02/how-female-en...</a> .<p>How would you detect or solve for a problem in this cluster?<p>* mentioning seed, since that sample would be most likely to be sufficient to gauge trust in underrepresented groups by investors.

Look at this clojure code:<p>>(derive ::rect ::shape)\n>(derive ::square ::rect)\n> (parents ::rect)\n-> #{:user/shape}\n(ancestors ::square)\n-> #{:user/rect :user/shape}\n(descendants ::shape)\n-> #{:user/rect :user/square}<p>Clojure gives you hierarchy &#x27;À la carte&#x27;. This means that you know longer tie the two things together, it easy in clojure for example to have many diffrent hierarchy that are independent but still dont get in each others way. Modeling the same with objects is hard. Just a example, for often good reasons multiple inheritance is not allowed in most languages, however if you use hierarchy as a domain model and not as programming model you generally want it.<p>2.<p>I agree with the articles point, people should not invent there own langauges for everything, however that is a terrible reason to discard the language for &#x27;large scale&#x27; production use. Every language has features that generally should be avoided, every language make it easy to do the wrong thing.

A movie made in native 3D will always look better than a postproduction kludge like Clash Of The Titans or most things Disney did. I also hate it when 3D is used an excuse for cheap effects like having things fly directly at the viewer or hover in front of them, as that ruins both the credibility of the quality of the effect and the seriousness of how it can be used.<p>When audio was added to movies, people said it ruined them; then colour; 3D is just the next step of that iteration.",1390209235

Fragmentation happens... and that&#x27;s bad for everyone. I rather have people like you upset at me for forcefully upgrading your system than dealing with all the support tickets of <i>&quot;My IE6 and Firefox 3.5 show a blank page during checkout&quot;.</i> There are major advances happening in webdevelopment and they&#x27;d move even faster if webdevs didn&#x27;t have to worry about people who refuse to let go of some old browser.<p>If it&#x27;s an old version of TurboTax, fine. That&#x27;s your thing. It only effects you. But the percentage of different browsers out there has an effect on everyone. It&#x27;s like the way I was holding on to an out-dated at&t SIM card. They mailed me 4 new SIM cards but I refused to upgrade. Eventually, they just cut my service and I had to go into the shop to upgrade. When they&#x27;re trying to support all the cellphones out there and upgrading the infrastructure, they can&#x27;t have people dragging their feet with old SIMs they need to support. There is a very real cost to supporting old SIM cards that don&#x27;t fit into the infrastructure they&#x27;re trying to build out for new phones & SIMs. There is real cost in supporting old web-browsers when technology in web-development is moving ahead in leaps.<p>I stand by what I said; if you think you&#x27;ve solved an issue by staying on an old browser version, you&#x27;ve made a mistake somewhere upstream that needs to be fixed there. If you truly can&#x27;t move forward for some reason - go download some developer/nightly branch and install that. I&#x27;d want that branch to update itself to production path every month though because holding an old browser version is not a valid solution.

I read it through, but I&#x27;m afraid it doesn&#x27;t really present much of a case for... whatever it is Solnit wants to do about housing policy in SF, besides sneer at tech workers.  I found the piece frustratingly long on vague innuendo and ressentiment, and short on arguments about what we ought to value, and how we ought to achieve it.<p>Many of her arguments, such as they are, seem to follow backwards from the desired conclusion that tech workers are awful and their employers, even worse.  For example, consider:<p>> The Google Bus means so many things. It means that the minions of the non-petroleum company most bent on world domination can live in San Francisco but work in Silicon Valley without going through a hair-raising commute by car ... the corporations of Silicon Valley aren’t much interested in improving public transport, and in fact the many corporations providing private transport are undermining the financial basis for the commuter train.<p>Of course, if the companies <i>didn&#x27;t</i> organize shuttle buses, then they&#x27;d be accused of ruining the environment by letting their employees drive nine hours every day.  &quot;How come the most powerful corporations in the world can&#x27;t shell out for a shuttle bus&quot;, you can just imagine the author asking.  Furthermore, suppose Google et al. <i>did</i> lobby California for a fifty mile commuter rail project from SF to SV that serves practically no one but... Google et al.&#x27;s employees.  Headline: Greedy Corporations Buy Off Transit Authority for Tech Nerd Express, Shift Costs to Public.  In general, I&#x27;m a big fan of public transit because I think it&#x27;s a situation where collective action can often improve efficiency.  But arguing that Google is destroying civil society by not &#x27;heightening the contradictions&#x27; in order to get the transit authority to build a railway to nowhere is kind of rich.<p>Solnit&#x27;s discussion of rent control is also pretty amazing.  She punctuates her (completely understandable) complaints about the rental market with astonishment that the textbook unintended consequences of rent control persist despite rent control, never considering that they might be <i>due</i> to rent control.  Prospective tenants supplicating to landlords, live-in couples occupying two units just to lock in tenancy, landlords <i>dis</i>-preferring long-term tenants, the overall lack of response in the housing supply to demand; these are classic symptoms which noted conservative Paul Krugman diagnoses in the article I linked elsewhere in this thread.  If someone wants to write a piece in LRB defending rent control in SF, I&#x27;d sincerely like to read it.  But you have to <i>argue</i> for it, not simply assume the desirability of a policy which is practically unanimously opposed by the people who study it professionally.<p>Finally, although I&#x27;m of mixed mind about whether I even want to indulge this line of thought, I find it pretty stunning that someone with Solnit&#x27;s pedigree (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit#Early_life_and_education"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit#Early_life_and_e...</a>) presumes to speak for the poor and downtrodden, those &quot;more frail&quot;, in a first-person piece called &quot;Diary&quot;.  It&#x27;s the same sort of tenor you find on flyers like this one (<a href=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/3fd37355541474385f8db330e58ebb0f/tumblr_my4qs5jHQq1rb85lvo1_500.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://25.media.tumblr.com/3fd37355541474385f8db330e58ebb0f/...</a>).  The author, who fancies themselves immersed in &quot;poverty, homelessness and death..violence and degradation&quot;, makes it <i>painfully obvious</i> that they have at least one liberal arts degree.<p>From what I&#x27;ve read so far, it seems to me like the &quot;opponents&quot;* of tech workers in the bay area are basically the cultural ancien regime, upset about losing their cool digs and relative status to a bunch of nerds (Solnit is pretty explicit about this).  If that&#x27;s what this is about, I wish they&#x27;d just say it.  And if they&#x27;re genuinely concerned about the legitimately poor<i></i>,<i></i>* they should recommend serious proposals, and would probably have the support of many of the &quot;technocrats&quot; Solnit so despises.  But mixing and matching leaves me short on both pathos and policy.<p>---<p>* I use scare quotes because I still don&#x27;t understand what they want to do about tech workers in SF, except disdain them <i>so hard</i>.  Which, have at it...<p>* * A group that, by the way, has practically zero intersection with the set of people to whom it would occur to hand out passive-aggressive, Flesch-Kincaided-out typeset essays concluding with &quot;GET THE FUCK OUT OF OAKLAND&quot;<p>* * * I also suspect I am less outraged than Solnit is that a man cannot make a living as the almost-Poet-Laureate of San Francisco, and must find a cheaper place.

(There are many very smart people in both fields) However, they are fairly irreplaceable. This is because to be good at finance you need to be both smart and experienced. The only way to get experience is to work in finance for several years, and as a result, the supply of traders is fairly limited. (compared to the demand) Generally, someone who starts finance will not make their firm any money for the first year, but after five years they will be earning their firm a lot of money. The supply of good traders is a lot smaller than the supply of smart people.<p>A second reason why they are compensated so highly is that they are working in a highly leveraged job where the labor cannot be easily be divided between multiple people. This is  similar to how CEO&#x27;s make a lot of money, because being a good CEO produces a lot of value for the company and the position cannot be split between multiple people. (I&#x27;m not trying to imply that traders produce as much value to society as CEO&#x27;s do) Being a marginally better trader will make your firm millions more per year. Good hedge funds have 100-1000 million of assets under management per front-office employee. (For example, D.E. Shaw or Bridgewater Associates)",1390208667

I&#x27;m making more in my first year of tech contracting than a mid-career academic or teacher would make in salary.<p>I&#x27;ve got a male friend working in nursing. I admire his dedication to caring for people, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d switch places. I get to write Python all day, he gets to clean up other people&#x27;s bodily fluids for a dismal salary. We both think we&#x27;ve got the better deal in life because he gets to care for people while I just write dull programmes for computers to make some business more financially successful, and that&#x27;s got no grand overriding meaning unless you are a hardcore capitalist Ayn Rand type.<p>Why is nursing not attractive to men? Because men don&#x27;t care about people? Absolutely not. How about: because of low pay and because gender roles dictate that it&#x27;s not a &quot;manly&quot; thing to do? Indeed, the friend who works in nursing is a campy and effeminate gay man. Which matches the stereotype.<p>The reasons men and women go into particular jobs isn&#x27;t set in stone. There&#x27;s no gene that turns one person into a programmer and another into a nurse. It&#x27;s social conditioning, it&#x27;s stereotypical gender roles, it&#x27;s educational opportunities, it&#x27;s pay and benefits - it&#x27;s a whole bunch of shit we can change.<p>If a woman wants to go into computing, she should be able to without having to deal with stupid nerds-as-the-new-frat-boys brogrammer bullshit, and if guys want to go into nursing, they should be able to do so with their heads held high and without anyone questioning their masculinity or making assumptions about their sexuality.

When burning organic matter, there tend to be many byproducts produced.  Often more harmful than not.  Odds are we didn&#x27;t evolve to breathe them on a constant basis.  If we had, this stuff wouldn&#x27;t give us mouth and lung diseases so much, would it?<p>If we had evolved to tolerate doing this to ourselves, then we wouldn&#x27;t be arguing about this.  IMHO, some people do seem to adapt better to burning things and inhaling them.

Probably not.  People like getting high.  Take that away and what reason is there to smoke?  But I digress...<p>So, to answer your question, &quot;all of the above&quot;.

That is a reflection of his own judgment of stereotypes though, not something innate to adolescent boys.<p>Then his proposed solution is to segregate males and females to facilitate learning.<p>Think about that.<p>Rather than discipline the kids who are acting out, teaching them to act in ways appropriate to civil society, he thinks that <i>segregating boys and girls</i> is the correct play. Even by his own logic, he&#x27;s perpetuating the gender divide. Rather than stop the &quot;pseudo-masculine efforts&quot;, he removes the women from the situation so that said &quot;pseudo-masculine efforts&quot; can continue. It&#x27;s a really, really bizarre &#x27;solution&#x27; when smoothing the gender divide is a stated goal.<p>It&#x27;s akin to a company&#x27;s HR getting complaints from female staff that the male executives are swearing too much or making sexual jokes or _insert_stereotypical_sexist_male_exec_behavior_here_. Rather than addressing the offending behavior, HR chooses to give females the &quot;opportunity&quot; to go have their own meetings down the hall on different days.

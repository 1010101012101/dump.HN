After all, your chances of winning a lottery and of affecting an election are pretty similar. From a financial perspective, playing the lottery is a bad investment. But it's fun and relatively cheap: for the price of a ticket, you buy the right to fantasize how you'd spend the winnings - much as you get to fantasize that your vote will have some impact on policy.""<p>I fantasize that my vote for Bob Barr will throw the election into a tie, creating a giant entertaining mess even bigger than the aftermath of the 2000 election. Also, I will get some warm fuzzies over the next 4 years knowing that I didn't vote for the winner when they inevitably screw up. Lastly, I am a contrarian by nature. I will enjoy being the only one of my friends that did not vote for Barack Obama, much as I enjoy being the only one who does not pray in a church.",1225756626

It would be helpful if you know at least C# or VB.NET and some ideas on how the framework works.\nHave a look on this site below for some examples of apps develop using the framework.\n<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa145791.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa145791.aspx</a><p>Another route, I have met some people who do mobile development in C++ or wxWidgets.

Here are a few reasons:<p>- If you're a hacker, you probably didn't start with market research, you probably started with code, and you already have competition that you just weren't diligent enough to find.  Or the other standard view -- you don't think you're actually competing with the market leaders, because your head is stuck too far in the concept.  But you are and everyone else will see that.<p>- Unless you're funded prior to launching, or have a team with an impressive (startup) track record, nobody in the press cares about your launch.  We got picked up in a couple of German (where we're based) news sites which didn't bring in nearly as many hits as posts here or in my personal (fairly widely syndicated) blog.<p>- Most people when they hear your idea will think that it's dumb.  This is universal.  Practicing making it sound not dumb is much more important than worrying about people copying your (dumb-sounding) idea.  Learning to pitch your idea takes a while.<p>If you've already been funded and developing for a couple years before launch, yeah, then you can make a bit of a splash when you launch.

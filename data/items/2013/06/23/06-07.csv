5926488,comment,5925828,5925828,5,0,roansh,,,"I have just appeared in third year finals in an engineering college, which happens to be in India. So, I know pretty much about the way things work in `Engineering institutes&#x27; in India. \nThe thing is that, in about last 5 years, number of Institutes have grown so fast that one wouldn&#x27;t even imagine. The year I took admission in my College(2010), there were about only two colleges in the district I live, where, now, there&#x27;re 6 colleges now! Most of the politicians   have realized that `there is so much money&#x27; in Engineering institutes! The don&#x27;t give a shit about Education quality.\nHaving really bad score in Entrance exam after 12th grade, I had no option but to take admission in one of such a college.\nSo, what these `leaders&#x27; do, is hire freshers as professors (those who&#x27;re unable to land a job as a programmer). They lack in knowledge/skills. \nNext reason is that, most (almost 99%) of the students who are pursuing degree have their only motive is to - secure their future by having a good job. They don&#x27;t LEARN. They `remember&#x27; things to get a good score. That&#x27;s their sole purpose. Because, they think having good score will give them a good job. \nPeople can&#x27;t LEARN things by just reading several books, they have to USE things that they&#x27;ve read. Just to make sure if they are able to use what they&#x27;ve just read (or learned). \nCurrently there&#x27;re about 80 students in my class. We had to develop a dynamic website as a mini project in the last semester. \nYour people would not believe it, but 99% of the people had it downloaded from Internet (or taken from some former student). Worst thing is, they were only static pages. And even worse is, faculties didn&#x27;t say a thing while demonstrating those projects!!! I assumed the only reason that could happen is the faculties themselves are utterly lacking in knowledge!\nIn second year, I wrote a simple packet sniffer and port scanner in C (again, as a mini-project), the `external&#x27; professor didn&#x27;t even see the code, he waster almost half an hour asking me things about Packer Sniffer (He had no idea about what that is!)\nThe only reason I can think if this unemployment is the quality of Engineers..",1371970569

5926483,comment,5924832,5925304,1,0,mtts,,,"I think you&#x27;re missing the point. A creole language, which English is, after a fashion, is a language that comes about when speakers of different languages come together and come up with something that&#x27;s intelligible to speakers of both languages(1). It is by its very nature simple. Grammatical complexity is very much reduced and the phonology converges on what is pronouncable by all speakers of the new language (and therefore is reduced in complexity as well.<p>Now I&#x27;ll grant you that the differences between Old English and Old French aren&#x27;t that large, which probably accounts to English being relatively complex for a creole language, but if you compare English grammar and phonology to that of related non-creole languages such as German, Danish or French, you&#x27;ll find in English they&#x27;re much, much simpler. Not as simple as in Indonesian/Malay (which jumbles Arabic, Sanskrit and a bunch of Austronesian languages) or Tok Pisin (which jumbles English and a bunch of mutually unrelated Papuan tongues) but at least as Germanic languages go, English is fairly easy to learn.<p>Of course Esperanto is a jumble as well, but it&#x27;s a jumble that is entirely artificial. I&#x27;d argue that a natural creole such as English or Swahili is superior: it&#x27;s developed over dozens of years by a large number of speakers of widely differing skill levels whereas Esperanto was thought up by a small number of highly skilled language experts.<p>I&#x27;ll agree with you that <i>for native speakers of Indo-European langues</i> (like mine, which isn&#x27;t English, by the way), Esperanto is easy to learn and use. But my point is it is not easy to learn for people who aren&#x27;t native speakers of an Indo-European language and that if you&#x27;re going to make these people learn an Indo-European language anyway, you might as well just make it English.<p>(1) technically speaking, that&#x27;s a pidgin, of course. But once the pidgin starts having native speakers, it becomes a creole, so the point still stands<p>edit: typo",1371970457

But when n grows prohibitively large, you have to go with solutions that are less than ideal.<p>My alma mater, thirty years ago, eschewed the traditional college application in favor of a more homebrew approach: since it was a small liberal arts college, it felt that the best way to see if a student was a fit for the college was to place him there for a span of a week or so: meeting with professors, faculty, taking a tour of the place, making sure things &#x27;clicked&#x27;.  He or she took an exam at the end of it, focused less on trying to define the student intellectually and more whether or not they were engaged with the college: there were quizzes on campus trivia (we&#x27;re the second oldest college in the nation, and talk about our history incessantly), open-ended questions about what they liked, et cetera -- all designed to see if the student was really meant to be a part of the college.<p>This worked twofold: it let the admissions faculty see whether or not the student was really taking the experience seriously, and it let the student see whether or not they wanted to take it seriously.<p>(Why no math tests?  When a professor spends a few hours with a prospective student, they can generally deduce whether or not they&#x27;re smart enough to handle the rigor.)<p>Today, such a practice is impossible: the number of applicants has increased by at least 20x.

This is due to a selfish, lazy motivation, because I don&#x27;t want to rapidly alternate between gas and brake.<p>I think there is also a psychological component to seeing bright red brake lights. I want to say it creates a reactive, and often overly reactive response. I imagine lifting a foot off the gas pedal often creates sufficient deceleration without the alarm caused by hitting the brake pedal but many people don&#x27;t drive this way. Maybe we should have two shades, or colors, or a full gradient to indicate level of braking? What if a brake light could indicate current speed?",1371969084
5926445,comment,5925828,5925828,5,0,chunky1994,,,"As a current undergrad from India who chose to seek an education abroad, I probably have a unique perspective on this.<p>1) Yes, most Indians who graduate from their colleges often are lacking quite horrifically in their knowledge as compared to a similar non-Indian counterpart, primarily because the culture within the educational system is largely based around acquiring short term knowledge and then never looking back.<p>While in the Canadian system, I found it quite pleasant that everything is gradually built from what you learn in your first year, the Indian system is modularized and disparate, with large parts of what they learn forgotten in their earlier undergraduate years.<p>2) There is a vast variation between the quality of universities in India, however even the IITs are definitely not the same thing anymore. My father who went to IIT gave me the impression that it was definitely a centre for higher learning, where the students actually seriously thought critically about what they were studying, whereas now (through the descriptions of most of my friends and colleagues), they have been reduced to places where one no longer has such a luxury, as their marks matter more than the actual knowledge they accumulate; this wouldn&#x27;t be much of a problem if the courses actually aligned with real world problems, however the courses deal are largely tangential to real hard work that one might see in academia or industry.<p>3) In contrast to this, American (Or Canadian) universities offer a much more comprehensive education, and while definitely relying more on the initiative of the particular student, they generally encourage independent critical thinking, and don&#x27;t place much emphasis on a number received from a three hour exam. This I think is the crucial difference between graduates of these universities and graduates from Indian universities, those who actually go on to do something important would have had a much harder time in an Indian university than a non-Indian one.<p>I should also probably state for completeness that I am not pursuing and Engineering degree, and I am a physics major, however I don&#x27;t believe that makes much of what I have said irrelevant.",1371969076

I'm sure that the visitors to that site are very different to those who regularly visit HN.  For me (and that's only a single data point) HN provides value that matters to me.  Launchly, on the other hand, doesn't hold any appeal nor interest.<p>IMHO your best way forward is to start a dialogue with those who do visit your site, ask them what they are looking for, etc.  Only then are you in a position to better provide value for your visitors.  It's all to do with <i>Marketing</i>.",1247281017
698766,comment,697847,698032,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I really wish people would comment with downvotes.<p>To clarify: Despite the name, this site applies to all language learning (and in fact all learning). Khatzumoto is a very good writer and has some very good insights. If my comments don't convince you, consider this. He learned Japanese (which I think almost anyone will agree is harder than French) in 18 months. When I say learned, I mean well enough to move to Japan and live and work there full time.<p>All Japanese All The Time is well-known throughout language learning communities and if you take the time to read some of what Khatzumoto has posted, I'm sure you'll be pleased. If not, I'll take a downvote on this too.",1247280907

I'm in Japan. \nSo yeah - real free. On scribd for 1 month only, only in the US and no download. Yawn. People like Lessig and Doctorow have done this better - and I suspect Lessig's Free Culture is more insightful than this paen to segmented pricing models.<p>Note - I'm not advocating free downloads so I can freeload - I'm a prolific buyer of both paper and ebooks (not kindle - since it also is US only - sigh )",1247279968

I don't entirely agree, but it's not all wrong either.<p>----------------<p>Firefox is following the MIME type spec with the sort of excessive zeal for standards documents at the expense of real world practicality that you often get with open source projects.<p>Usually, the MIME type is coming from the web server guessing the file's type, which is not itself reliable, so you've pushed the problem to the server side. [interpolation by jerf: Slavishly following these MIME types is not a valuable thing to do, since the MIME type is not very reliable here.]<p>The end result of this is to ruin the entire value of the MIME type by encouraging people in the <i>real</i> world to serve more content up as text/plain (or even worse, text/html). I just edited /etc/mime.types when I administered a lab, because my users just wanted to see the content without spawning extra processes.<p>I don't know why they don't have a mailcap blacklist; not everyone uses GUI-focused distributions that spew bad values all around /etc in a misguided attempt to be helpful.<p>How would I program this? Always display unknown MIME types that look like text as text, with an infobar at the top giving other options. The infobar idiom is a nice feature and they should use it.<p>-------------------<p>jerf: I do quite like that suggestion. I'd also point out that while deciding whether something is text may be, strictly speaking, undecidable, in practice it's about 98% feasible.",1247278294

698740,comment,698421,698482,0,0,Ennis,,,"""When you ask for credible evidence of illegal actions, no one can point to anything""<p>This isn't true. Taibbi's article justified every claim that was made. I read it twice because it felt more like entertainment journalism than fact the first time through. But that is just his style. He is very personal in his approach. I spent the entire night looking into his claims and allegations because the article was very unexpected - I haven't heard of Goldman conspiracies before. His claims all check out. His conclusions are just that - his - and you are to make your own as a reader.<p>It's a shame he didn't reference everything in his article. But nothing was more than a few Google searches away to verify.<p>So again, yes Goldman did many illegal things in it's past and it got punished for it every time by the government. Taibbi argued that the punishment did not dissuade the firm from further illegal activity. This is true as well. The penalties were all mere fractions of windfall made from the crimes - for the specific instances mentioned by Taibbi. I personally see the Government organizations at fault there - Taibbi says they are stacked with Goldman alumni so you be the judge of who to blame.<p>Megan McArdle says the same thing as you just did - in many more words.<p>""It's not that everything he says is wrong, but the bits that are true aren't interesting, and the bits that are interesting aren't true.""<p>She spent the article attacking Taibbi instead of CLEARLY pointing out which ""interesting bits aren't true."" Even in the comments, she is more concerned with attacking Taibbi.<p>Example:<p>""I don't disagree that the banks need to be taken down about eighteen pegs. But I don't think that Taibbi's the man to do it.""<p>I wish she would tell me why she is right instead of insisting that Taibbi is wrong. In fact I would settle for WHY she thinks Taibbi is wrong. But we get zilch for details.<p>In her words ""I don't think that the message excuses incoherence on the details.""<p>In John Travolta's words, ""Look who's talking..""",1247278183

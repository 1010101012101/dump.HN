2419689,comment,2419504,2419504,4,0,jameskilton,,,"Frankly, if there's one part of RSpec I wish never existed, it's the 'be_' construction. If tests are supposed to be part of the documentation on how to use the code, then in this case Rspec actually hurts you. I've been converting all my be_ usage (except for be_true, be_false, and be_nil) to the following:<p>frood.hoopy?.should be_true\nfrood.knows_where_its_towel_is?.should be_false<p>Now you know exactly how the code works (this is the method name, it returns a boolean), vs:<p>froot.should be_hoopy<p>which requires you to be very familiar with Rspec to know that it will magically add the ""?"" when searching for the method, and the ""be_"" is extraneous to allow ""readability"".<p>Though back to the OP, if you want tests that read like manuals, Rspec is the wrong place to look. Tools exist explicitly for this purpose, namely Cucumber. Code is code, and it's always going to look like code. Any attempts to make it read more like English gets you into the realm of ridiculous verbosity or code explosion as you keep abstracting to give you things that ""read good"".",1302188371

Rather than accept that they've learned a lot, and will do better next time, they'll get an all new group in to do the next one.<p>Of course I, and any other developer reading this, will have huge opinions about how they messed up, and how could _any_ system cost that much in the first place.

Darken wallpaper, windows appear in a miniaturised form of themselves to give you an overview of all open windows.<p>The workspace manager looks just like Mission Control's space selector. In Lion the spaces are shown horizontally at the top of the screen, but both Gnome and Lion show the spaces on the opposite side of the screen to the default dock position. I have to say, the space is used more effectively in Gnome by stacking them vertically.<p>The switches (instead of checkboxes) as visible in the YouTube video embedded (0:04) are <i>clearly</i> inspired by iOS' ON|OFF switches.

I wear that hat in my current company (along with a few others, including planning) and no, there really isn't much depth you can get into with devs without becoming a dev. Most devs (not all) largely disregard customer support and feedback anyway, since support doesn't 'see the big picture' (a less charitable person would say 'because support works with existing products, and we've already covered that now-boring ground' - after all, how many laments do we hear of devs that have to work on 'maintenance' rather than new prod development :).<p>The key point is that even if you're interacting directly with the devs, you're still not really being proactive or learning concrete skills. The job is still pretty much reactive. If you're driven or feel the need to develop, there really isn't much to strive for. You're not the one that gets to figure out code, or create marketing campaigns. There's not really any ongoing feeling of ""<i>I</i> made this!"".

If you're looking for a pep talk, look away now.<p>Let's start with first impressions before I dig into functionality and actual results:<p>1) It needs to look nicer. People who like to cook tend to like things to look appealing, particularly as a $1.99 app.<p>2) Garlic isn't a great example to have as your screen shot - it's not inspiring and it's the sort of thing you have in a draw anyway, not something you pick to make a meal out of. Try something more substantial and interesting - Aubergine / Eggplant say (though the main point below relates to the result for Egg plant).<p>3) Speaking personally, you need a vegetarian flag which culls all meat and fish (or ideally options to remove meat, fish, poultry individually.)<p>All of that is simple to fix and you could possibly do in a day or so (most of which would be tagging things as vegetarian or not).<p>Getting on to the actual results, your main problem is that your data sucks <i>big time</i>, as in unusable, pointless big time in it's current form.<p>Look at the screen shot which shows matches for garlic and includes cornstarch.<p>Huh?<p>Cornstarch is a thickener, it goes with things you want to be thicker, it doesn't go with things you don't want to be thicker. I have no idea why it would or wouldn't go with garlic specifically (especially as garlic is solid and therefore needs no thickening).<p>I'm guessing that you've automatically mined this data but however you've got it you need a human to review it as I suspect that there are things in there you have to cull because they make no sense and undermine the credibility of the rest of the data.<p>Do a search on egg plant and you'll get among the results cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, black and white pepper (too common), salt (ditto), flour, butter and vegetable oil. These are not things you match with an ingredient, they're things you season, prepare or use to cook an ingredient. In terms of what you're doing they're meaningless and should be hidden.<p>Again, that's all easily fixable, you just need to skim the data and pull together an exclude list and edit these out of the results set.<p>But it then lists semi-sweet chocolate chips, banana, raisins and vanilla extract. Now these may go with egg plant and there may be recipes that use both but they're not natural matches (in the way that say tomatoes - not including on the list incidentally - are). The average user is going to look at them and go ""seriously? what am I meant to cook with Egg Plant and Banana"".<p>Fortunately you have a link for that. Sort of. Click on banana in the egg plant results and you get a list of things that go with egg plant and banana (same issues as above) but also a link to recipe puppy for those ingredients. This is good in theory but have you looked at it?<p>Try it. The link is for egg (rather than egg plant) and banana. Not sure if the issue is yours or recipe puppy's (though I think the later - plant is in the URL). Even if it didn't drop the plant, recipe puppy thinks eggplant is one word, you think it's two so they'd never match.<p>But worst of all, recipe puppy seems to do an ""or"" search rather than an ""and"" one. In any case it certainly can't find me these supposed aubergine and banana recipes which means I'm none the wiser as to what I'm meant to be cooking and makes me ask again where the data is from.<p>Sorry to be harsh but I wouldn't be selling this in it's current form, I think you're going to damage your brand if you don't work out some of these issues before it gets out there and if that happens you're in the sort of trouble you can't undo easily.",1302186007

Things like SATAN and HotJava were avant-garde exceptions, and Emacs Lisp was a holdover from another era (and we often used vi instead because it was noticeably faster).<p>Today, I regularly use an email client written mostly in JS, message boards written entirely in Python, a chat client written in Python, a high-performance file transfer program written in Python, a music player written in C#, system monitoring tools (iotop, htop, dstat) written in Python, a version-control system written in Python, and so on.  In 1995, I used an email client written in C, a newsreader written in C talking to a netnews server written in C (although early netnews servers had been partly written in sh, they were rewritten in C for performance), an IRC client written in C, file-transfer programs written in C, music players implemented in hardware, ""top"" written in C, version-control systems written in C (although, again, the first version of CVS was a shell script), and so on.<p>I don't think it's true that ""basic apps were starting to move onto the web"" in 1995.  Web sites that were really programs with HTML user interfaces didn't really start to take off until around 1997, by my recollection.  I joined eBay's AuctionWeb in 1996, but it was quite unusual (and it was promptly rewritten in, I assume, C++, as eBayISAPI.dll).<p>GUIs <i>could</i> be done in Tk, or for that matter PowerBuilder or Visual Basic, but that was thought to be ""for amateurs"".

You can write a lot of very decent code this way and have a little bit of ""the best of both worlds"", and avoid getting into a lot of the admittedly very dark corners and nasty surprises that C++ has to offer...",1302184974

However, from the book link, apparently: <i>The data for this book was obtained by programitally[SIC] examining just under a million publicly available recipes.</i><p>That method of acquiring the data shows in the less useful results. For example, with basil, it includes in the top pairings SALT, GARLIC, ONIONS, BLACK PEPPER. Which, of course, would be found in pretty much any recipe involving basil. Yet, it misses the more classic pairings like mozzarella cheese, eggs, lamb, pizza, etc.<p>My recommendation -- buy ""The Flavor Bible"".",1302184817

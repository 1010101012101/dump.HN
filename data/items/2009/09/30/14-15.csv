852462,comment,852198,852198,0,0,Maro,,,"I'm one of the lead programmers of Keyspace, which is a key-value store. The main strength of Keyspace is the consistent replication, but right now I'll tell you what my experiences are building a web app (real-time search) using Keyspace. In other words, what happened when I drank my own kool-aid.<p>1. Schemaless. This is a half-truth. In reality there is always some kind of schema, otherwise you'd get chaos. What works for us in Keyspace, where everything is a string, is to use ""/"" as a separator convention. So we have keys like:\n""/user/id:001"" => <data><p>More complicated example:<p>""/user/id:001/view/keyword:keyspace/""<p>2. Listing. Since listing happens on a prefix basis in Keyspace (give me everything that starts with ""/user/id:001""), if you just want to get a list of some properties of the user, you have to create the list explicitly, otherwise you'll get all the keys under the user. Eg.<p>""/user/id:001/views/list/keyword:scalien"" => null\n""/user/id:001/views/list/keyword:keyspace"" => null<p>3. If you need to list by property X, you need to create a subtree for it, as above. This sucks if you figure this out at a later point, because you have to programatically parse your existing data and create it, besides adding it to the online code for new items. That's why RDBMSs are so good.<p>4. Backups. No good backup strategy at this point, hot or cold.<p>..<p>So why should anyone put up with this? You have to realize there's lots of hype right now, in reality KV stores should only be used by a small fraction of DB users. If an RDBMS is Java/C++, then a KV store is (can be) Assembly. You have much more control over what's going on. (You can of course get the same control by having a giant key-value table in your RDBMS.) You can put a cache layer in your stack more easily.<p>So you should think of a good KV store as something that you use under certain hi-performance cases, and even then, the KV store should offer some plus over having a giant key-value table in My/Postresql. Usually, that plus is some kind of distribution or replication that usually works. In case of Keyspace it's replication.<p>The other big plus is, as I learned, is that programming in the KV model is <i>much much more</i> natural then having embedded SQL statements in your code. A typical segment in my (Python) code is:<p>users = conn.listkeys(""/user/id:%s/views/"" % user_id)\nfor (...):<p>This is much nicer then having SQL statements, and since you're using a KV store, it can't get more complicated than this.

All I’m saying is: Let someone else decide that. Magazines, editors, agents. They all employ young people making $22,000 a year whose job it is to read through piles of manuscripts and send you back letters telling you that you aren’t good enough yet: LET THEM DO IT. Don’t pre-reject yourself. That’s their job, not yours. Your job is only to write your heart out, and let destiny take care of the rest.""<p>""There are heaps of books out there on How To Get Published. Often people find the information in these books contradictory. My feeling is -- of COURSE the information is contradictory. Because, frankly, nobody knows anything. Nobody can tell you how to succeed at writing (even if they write a book called 'How To Succeed At Writing') because there is no WAY; there are, instead, many ways. Everyone I know who managed to become a writer did it differently. sometimes radically differently.

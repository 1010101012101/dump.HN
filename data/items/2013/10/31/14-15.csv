Because once you become larger you have the same benefits as everyone by being employed by your own company. With that in mind I think unemployment benefits or similar is the wrong way of thinking about it. You aren&#x27;t really unoccupied, you just currently aren&#x27;t getting paid enough for what you do. This is a lot more similar to being a student. So student benefits is probably a better match.

Do you second guess the crypto on your laptop because you might be subject to evil maid or other physical attacks? No, because there is some inherent trust, just like the people who do online banking and shopping.

Maybe someone using it doesn&#x27;t care about the integrity of the instructions delivered; it depends on the case.

Admittedly, I&#x27;m not a hacker, not in the &quot;break into a secure system and take control of it&quot; sense of the word.<p>Today I saw this article (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-reports-nsa-secretly-intercepts-data-links"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/30/google-rep...</a>). I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve seen similar ones recently, from large companies and other countries. When you think about companies like Yahoo and Google, you realize that we are talking about some very, very smart people. These are not easy companies to get into. Their interviews are designed to screen out all but the very best, the most elite programmers. And when you are basically the &quot;go to website&quot; for most of the known world, you spend a LOT of time on things like security, and tracking requests, etc. And let&#x27;s be honest, Google and Yahoo are in the business of tracking other websites - it is their bread and butter. They understand it and know it.<p>So I ask myself - HOW? How did the government manage to find  and acquire programmers so skilled, so elite, that they are even smarter than the Google and Yahoo guys tied together? Moreover, how did they manage to consistently hack them?<p>To my knowledge, there are two main ways to get into a system. The first is what most people assume - that&#x27;s a brute force attack. Find a weakness in the system, exploit that weakness, break in and do what you can before pappa bear catches you and kicks you out. Not a very effective approach for long term information gathering, right? And once done, the exploit is usually addressed.<p>The other way is to get someone &quot;on the inside&quot; to help. Get them hired, and then get them to covertly build a &quot;back door&quot; for them, an easy way in. This too is way easier said than done on so many levels. I don&#x27;t know about you, but there are several guys on my team, and when security changes are made, there are lots of people who are aware of it, and would likely see it. It would be tough for me to build a back door without someone seeing it being checked in. Or able to find it easily, even just &quot;tripping over it&quot;.<p>But I digress. In order to hack Google, Yahoo, France, Germany, yada yada yada, you&#x27;d have to get an inside guy, a super-elite smarter-than-google type of hacker into every one of those places. They&#x27;d have to have elite hackers growing on a farm somewhere if nothing else, and then all the connections everywhere to secretly get them hired and into positions of security and power. HOW???<p>I just don&#x27;t understand. I seems like a unrealistic task to me. Maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a run of the mill engineer however... :)",1383231088

I also don&#x27;t think it very far fetched that the &quot;rights&quot; of prisoners in those prisons are not getting respected at all by (amongst others) German soldiers.<p>So you should only compare German police using torture Police, FBI or DEA or some department like that using torture inside America on American citizens. There I think it&#x27;s much, much less clear that the rate of torture in Germany is higher or lower than the rate used by American law enforcement agencies.

6646825,comment,6646219,6646678,1,0,Pxtl,,,"... I think the movie that came out of Watchmen is pretty much proof of the conjecture that it was unfilmable.  The director tried very hard to be faithful to the original - the changes were minor (some added ultra-violent fight scenes, and changing the nature of the SQUID) but the film that came out just wasn&#x27;t very good.  Some of the cast chewed the scenery a bit harder than was strictly necessary, but no film is going to have <i>perfect</i> acting.  And yet somehow it just was such a mess.  A shame, since I loved Moore&#x27;s book.<p>Watchmen is a book that&#x27;s designed to be read over and over and your own pace, with more to notice each time through.  I think everybody skims the Black Freighter stuff the first time.  Comics are so short that a good re-reading experience is prettymuch intrinsic to separating a decent comic from an excellent one.  That doesn&#x27;t really translate to film, since all the details and layers of the story just make the movie feel too dense.",1383228344

They predominate because I have no other means of getting in touch with them.  The people I hang out with most in person are all Amherst alums in the area; they almost never appear on my FaceBook, because I can talk to them in person.  If I do write something to them online, it's through PlanWorld, which is an Amherst-only social network hosted on an Amherst student organization's computers.<p>There's another group of friends I have: folks from my Harry Potter fandom days.  I'm FaceBook-friends with nearly all of them, but there's little activity between us.  Instead, I talk to them over AIM.  Why put up with the latency of the FaceBook wall when you can communicate instantly?<p>Then there are former coworkers from work that I stay in touch with.  Most of these people don't even <i>have</i> FaceBook accounts, though a couple do.  I use e-mail and LinkedIn to keep in touch with them, or I send them an IM and setup a time to get together for lunch.<p>I think a lot of people that make a big deal about the social graph are Boomers and Gen-Xers that are keen observers of today's ""always connected"" culture, but aren't really participants.  They know that social networking is a huge part of young people's lives, but have no idea just how pervasive it is or how many options people have.  The average American teenager now ""talks"" through phone, text-messaging, FaceBook, MySpace, LiveJournal, e-mail, AIM, and a half-dozen special interest sites.  There've been conversations I've had that were half-verbal and half-AIM, carried on through a mix of typing and talking with the other participant sitting 6 feet away.  The FaceBook social graph is pretty inaccurate when you consider all the options for back-channel communications.",1208451486

166444,comment,149052,150841,0,0,tstorer,,,"""Geeks and males and bloggers need to be characterized, judged and condemned where necessary.""<p>Here is where I believe you're wrong. There is no need to judge and condemn individuals in a web discussion, in fact it's counterproductive. When an argument becomes heated and sparks fly, that heat and fire should be directed at the content of the argument. Otherwise you're just insulting someone, who will then insult you back, and bingo, a typical message-board or blog-comment back-and-forth name-calling session has begun.<p>I agree that it can be necessary to point it out when someone is using tone to leave ""emotional trapdoors for people to respond to,"" but if the way you do it is to attack the person's character rather than by showing that the appeal to emotion is a poor argument, then you're just heading towards a flame war.<p>You say that attitudes such as ""don't feed the trolls"" lead to dull conformity. Don't you think that the dismal sameness of all troll-provoked flame wars is far more dull than an atmosphere of simple courtesy in which people actually listen to each other? I would go further than ""don't feed the trolls""--in any web discussion that has descended into acrimonious personal attacks, one should unilaterally withdraw. You cannot have the last word on the Internet and the smart way to avoid flame wars is to leave them.<p>It's trolls and flamers that are the surest way for a forum discussion to go downhill. The best way to help a forum be interesting and lively is not to remind everyone of ""rules of rhetoric"" or of conduct but to follow them oneself. But many people haven't thought about it in a systematic way, so it can be helpful to read a set of recommendations and apply whichever of them you wish. Publishing such things is not an attempt to control, but to persuade. You may have a beef with the attitude of ""smug nits"" who tell you what to do, but that doesn't mean that their recommendations aren't good ones.",1208448399

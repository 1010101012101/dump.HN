It's being an advocate of users.<p>Ads are by definition someone asking the world, ""who wants what we can provide?"" The value is often for the person asking, rather than the person listening. Most of the time, ads rarely match up the two parties well, and as a result, the company tries its damn hardest to put askers everywhere listeners are listening. The result making for a sub-par user experience.<p>Often times in a company's search for revenue, it forgets about the end-user, and justify unpleasant user experiences with ""Well, we gotta make money somehow."" One can say, ""well, if you don't like it, then leave."" When users have a first chance to do so, they will, and then who will you advertise to?<p>The exception are ads in search, where the person asking (advertiser) is really well matched with the person listening (searcher). Google used restraint when it came to ads. It could have completely blasted the end user with flashy banner ads which were typical when it first started. However, it looked out for basic user value and user experience first. It is possible to serve ads, and have a good user experience.<p>The OP never was against paying for a simplified YouTube. It's not against YouTube making money. But it is against losing sight of the basic value of watching videos. It's like if you once wrote control tower software, and added bells and whistles to the point where you're not able to land planes anymore.<p>Once again, it's advocate for the basic value for the end user. Sometimes, when adding all the new-fangled stuff, we might lose sight of the basic value. That's what he's getting at.",1346532804

4465086,comment,4464095,4465026,3,0,SeoxyS,,,"> So you dislike one magic but you like an other for pretty much no reason at all beyond knowing one and not the other? Consistency not your style?<p>The thing I love about Ruby's magic is that it's not really magic, it's an abstraction of solid fundamentals.<p>There's nothing really magic about ruby's yield, because it's a shortcut for explicitly declaring a closure and calling it. These are real language concepts that are well understood. PHP's yield, however, is a completely new construct. The jumping around does not follow well-understood rules (like calling a function). In ruby's case, that's what it does. It simply executes the function, and calls a closure.<p>In PHP now when you define a function, and then call that function; it may or may not execute the code inside that function, depending on whether later on in the function there's a `yield` keyword. That's <i>insane</i>!<p>Say you can see this in your code editor:<p><pre><code>    public function hello() {
        // a lot of important code
        $myvar = $this->other_cool_function();
        // more code
    }
    public function other_cool_function() {
        echo ""Hello, world!\n"";
    . . .
</code></pre>
You're looking at line 3, the line which calls the other cool function. Looking at this code you'd expect that to print ""Hello, world!"" first, and do some other stuff in the rest of the function. But wait! You didn't notice, 30 lines down the other function, there's a yield keyword, which means that the entire function doesn't ever execute until you start iterating over it",1346532623

For one, this app works perfectly as a web app. If Apple were to start blocking the web I think I might join you and head for another platform but I don't see them doing that.<p>This is not a good argument. Public pressure for apps of this kind will always be relatively low, so other interests will almost always take precedence, which means that states can effectively use their leverage to block undesirable content with minimal consequences.

C is great because it teaches a ton about how computers actually work, and practically forces you to learn CS concepts, without having to go as far as program counters, etc. in assembly. 
Low level networking is great because it teaches how properly architected systems are built in layers that each serve a particular purpose. It also helps tremendously when building systems later on in your career.
You have no idea how many ""programmers"" I have interviewed that can't even write a bubble sort because all they learned was Array.sort(). Starting with C fixes this problem, and sets the stage for proper learning (and appreciation) of high level languages.

The latter statement is pretty clearly false and I don't plan on listing examples to demonstrate that.<p>Going to a ""best-of-best"" school is rarely not in someone's best interest.  I did go to Harvard undergrad and I did not attend YC, but the draw is similar: sure the prestige matters and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, bu the real value is in the people that you live and work with, both peers and mentors.<p>Does giving money help you get into Harvard? I'm sure it does and if that money benefits the undergraduate population more than having someone who is subjectively less deserving in that class is a detriment, then it is in all students' best interest to have the paying member accepted.<p>Regarding the cheating:  It happens and I'm sure it happens at every campus.  I don't think that's what happened to half of this class.  It's a large class, it's probably required for Gov concentrators, and it seems clear that the expectations were not understood by the students or the teaching fellows.  What I DID do a lot of was pool notes in preparation for an exam, and I wouldn't be surprised if that is responsible for a lot of the consistencies in test answers.  Why redefine a term that you have a (""the"") definition for in your notes?  And honestly, I think it's healthy to have varying levels of respect for different material.  If I want to be a physicist, I'm going to really make sure I understand linear algebra.  For the Core class on Chinese history, I'm going to pool notes, cram, and try to scrape an A, because the A means more to me than the knowledge.<p>Sorry to address several topics; I've been reading HN for a while and this is my first comment, so I'm still learning the ropes.",1346531791

But then again, how hard would it have been to add a nicer closure syntax to PHP, instead of creating this mess of a feature?<p>Take this:<p><pre><code>    def each_line_in_file
      f = File.open('hello.txt', 'r')
      while line = f.gets

This is a real-world Ruby example of the feature. The semantics here are clear, each_line is a higher-order function which takes a closure as an arguments, and calls it (yields to it) for each line in the file. Ruby allows the programmer to use the yield keyword to avoid having to declare the closure as an argument (`def each_line(&block)`).<p>The same can even be implemented in PHP as it stands today, although the syntax is quite unsightly:<p><pre><code>    function each_line_in_file($callback) {
        $f = fopen('hello.txt', 'r');
        while (null !== ($line = fgets($f))) {

There are multiple factors:<p>* The battery chemistry is very unforgiving. You overcharge, it gets damaged, you over-discharge, it gets damaged. Same for charge and discharge current. The failure mode? Flammable gasses are released and eventually the whole thing sets itself on fire. And that's a fire you can't extinguish using typical means like water or regular fire extinguishers.<p>* All RC Li-Po batteries use a soft shell. If your model crashes the batteries can and will get crushed, which leads to an internal short-circuit, which eventually starts a fire.<p>* No RC Li-Po batteries incorporate Smart Battery controllers (like in laptop batteries) which could prevent overcharge/over-discharge and over-current conditions.<p>There have been plenty of incidents involving Li-Po fires, including whole houses burning down.<p>And still, the batteries don't change. Li-Po makes perfect sense for RC applications because it has great energy density and allows high discharge current. But to me it looks like some simple safety features could make this technology safe enough that you wouldn't have to treat your batteries like small bombs.<p>As a side-note, I've initially tried to use laptop Li-Ion batteries for my quadcopter. Each motor + propeller unit requires almost 12A @ 11V when at maximum speed - quite typical power requirements for a medium-sized quadcopter. I couldn't get more than 16A out of an older 6 cell battery (voltage was abruptly dropping if trying to draw more, so I guess this was the limit of the cells). I've then tried a new 9 cell battery (which was too heavy anyway). The controller on this battery considers 20A discharge an over-current condition and shuts off the output. So I'm stuck with Li-Po batteries and hoping that they won't set anything on fire.<p>I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with current-technology Li-Po powered vehicles flying around a city without being watched.",1346530416

The law in this matter should be updated to reflect what most people are against. If it isn't, it isn't ever going to be enforceable, just like it isn't enforceable now.<p>(No, I don't think that <i>every</i> law should be brought into line with majority morality.

Everyone is against plagiarism.<p>That's where the law falls down: We have laws against 'copyright infringement', a wonky idea that essentially nobody understands or cares about, but not against plagiarism, which is what most people <i>actually</i> are against and <i>will</i> work to combat.<p>Some people actually think copyright infringement and plagiarism are the same thing, to the extent they believe that proper attribution keeps them on the right side of the law. It does, of course: The right side of the <i>moral</i> law, which is all most people ever really follow.<p>Then you have the few zealots, who try to equate copyright infringement with theft. They might just as well try to claim that it's a violation just like rape is a violation so The Pirate Bay is guilty of rape.

It seems to me that Wolfram Alpha is a classic example of geeks building application that is useful for them but that is irrelevant to the other 99% of the world. And that 99% are the buying customers.\nI tried some usual web search phrases, and for each of them ""Wolfram wasn't sure what to do with my data"". It even suggested some alternative searches, but when I clicked, it still wasn't sure.\nOf course, it was happy to analyse some sinus function for me, but imagine how many people would like that?\nIn my opinion, Wolfram will be an excellent niche search engine for mathematicians, statisticians, and the geeks alike, but nothing near Google in any respect.",1242290003

Of course that could happen to a doctor, too, but overall, I imagine it to be a very upsetting situation if you really feel like you want to see a doctor, but your way is blocked by a nurse.<p>What does the market say anyway? Do people want cheap nurses as an alternative to doctors? If so, I guess it would be fine, just let people choose where they want to go. But that is not necessarily what is happening.

608411,comment,608307,608307,0,0,limmeau,,,"I don't now how much this topic is discussed outside Germany's blogosphere. A short summary on what has happened so far: Germany's federal parliament will be elected in September. Minister Ursula von der Leyen (family, youth) decided to do something about child abuse: the BKA (federal police office) is supposed to compile a daily blacklist of child pornography websites which all ISPs are supposed to block for their customers. Something similar is already deployed in Norway and other states, though usually not with access logs available to the police for prosecution.<p>This met fierce opposition of internet users, who argued that it would be more effective to just have the local police take down the servers and find the child abusers, and that turning the BKA into a censorship office would certainly offer politicians an opportunity to slowly grow the black list to include other illegal sites and, in a second step, sites with opinions.<p>This is currently the hot topic number one in German blogs, and the petition to stop this law is currently the second-most signed petition to the federal parliament (the most-signed petition being one to reduce taxes on gas).",1242288650

There are certain kinds of post (e.g. purely negative criticism/accusations) that I don't want to publish, because they are too easy to write and don't add anything to the conversation, and because I don't want to become known as ""another guy who rants a lot"". However, the main reason I don't publish those is the first one - I don't think they add enough to be worth polluting the internet with them.<p>When submitting articles to this, do remember one thing: It's easy to make waves by flinging accusations and heavy-handed criticism about. It's easy to destroy. Anyone with two brain cells can do it. What's hard is to create something where there was nothing.",1242288517
608408,comment,608182,608182,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is pretty solid reasoning and touches on a lot of good points.  But just as there are people who make the close-minded mistakes he cites, there are also people who are entirely too self-assured in their reliance on scientific data.<p>What makes me skeptical of the (overly) scientific mindset is that quality of life has nothing to do with understanding whatever physical realities we can ascertain by experiment.  I don't think science will ever meet philosophy, because a scientific theory must be falsifiable, and I don't believe that is a property of all truth (why should it be?).  To the contrary, I think the layers of human consciousness are far more subjective, subtle and complex than science will ever be able to tease apart.  Furthermore scientific research can easily makes flip assumptions about the nature of reality without suitable evidence (eg. that consciousness is a by-product of brain activity).  In these cases Philosophy is much more capable of addressing the issue than Science.<p>The problem is that we aren't an external observer of a closed system.  At some point everything we think we know boils down to some common-sense assumptions that are in no way provable.  This makes some people deeply uncomfortable.  Uncomfortable enough that they lash out against any form of mysticism or intuitive knowing.  Sure, the world is full of charlatans and scammers, but then so do we have sham research done on the corporate dime merely to have the appearance of scientific rigor.  It doesn't mean that traditional forms of understanding and wisdom have no place.<p>To the contrary, there is a lot of richness to reality that can't be captured by measurements and control groups.  Honestly I don't need to know the mechanics of every experience in my life.  When people say ""God told me..."" and you get hung up on the person's beliefs and the definition of God you are bound to miss the relevant point.",1242288498

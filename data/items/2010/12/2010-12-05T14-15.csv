Someone who lives in their head a lot may fare better at programming initially, for example.

1971698,comment,1971496,1971673,0,0,alexwestholm,,,"But there are many problems that information sharing just can't solve. Let's take African village X, imbue the population with a shared desire to break free of their government bondage, and give them a very poor infrastructure. Once they stop celebrating their defeat of the government, they're going to have to face issues such as who gets how much water. These things can't be solved by the Internet, and this is basically my original point about competing for resources.<p>I'd also take issue with the idea of the middle class being allied to the poor. Doesn't seem to work that way in the U.S., at least.<p>Don't get me wrong - I wish you were right. A more fair and equal world would undoubtedly be a better place, but I think the probability of that occurring anytime soon is pretty slim. Even if you solve issues like famine, medicine and economic development (which is a pretty gigantic if), something new will take their place as a focal point for competition.<p>EDIT: We could argue this til the cows come home. I think it just comes down to your optimistic view versus my pessimistic view. Only time will tell who's right.",1291561119

1971696,comment,1971006,1971277,0,0,vorace,,,"I worked on a project like this a while back. The heavy regulations eventually broke the whole concept. We had built a system for startups to pitch their businesses, and the investors would have been limited to accredited investors (those with > $1M or who make > $200K/year for two years). They would have bid for startups in a Dutch auction format, like the way Google went public.<p>However, to do this you need to be not just a startup, but an NASD certified ""broker dealer."" This imposes a couple things that software startups aren't good at:<p>1. You need $500K in the bank, just because of regulations. This means you need to raise much more than usual.<p>2. Several founders/early employees need to study for and pass Series 7 exams, which is what you need if you're a stockbroker. At least one person also needs to study for a similar test for brokerage management. Coding + learning to be a stock brokerage was not easy!<p>3. The associated legal costs were extremely high.<p>Kickstarter of course avoids all this by not dealing with any transfer of ownership so they don't need to worry about the government. They just sell access to creative folks, which is a good idea.<p>PS - Angel investors and VCs <i>hate</i> this concept, which makes it much harder to raise money. We brought it in front of all the biggies and were well connected, and each one argued about the personal value of their involvement, which may or may not be true.",1291561073

For any storage array that's a lot of data to write. It doesn't matter if its 0s or something else. Better is to use random data but even so you still have forensic techniques to revert this.<p>You say encryption is complicated but actually as a vendor its implicit in our system. As a customer you just mark the drive upon creation and then its invisible to both you as a customer and the cloud servers that are using the drive. That's really the whole idea, to make security measures that are convenient so people actually use them. Our customers see usually about a 10%-15% performance difference and we've got pretty high storage performance to begin with so it rarely means taking a performance hit compared with other platforms. We also allow multiple drives so users can categorise data by drives for encryption or not. Of course I'm biased regarding performance but the principles stand.<p>The other point of the blog post is to ask; what do other vendors do and do their customers have the ability to find out? Security through obscurity isn't an acceptable approach in the cloud. Everyone needs to be transparent and work to build confidence through solid information and education on how to use the cloud securely and effectively.<p>Kind regards,<p>Patrick",1291559497

1971630,comment,1971588,1971619,0,0,cloudsigma,,,"A lot of the compliance issues come from the mixing of infrastructure and the software and networking layers with many IaaS providers. In our cloud only the customer has root access and file system visibility. Essentially the cloud vendor then needs to demonstrate compliance with physical access and data protection/data leakage areas as employees don't have the ability to view data. This isn't a typical situation and for most clouds that are more like IaaS/PaaS hybrids it opens quite a can of worms.<p>As a Swiss based cloud currently we'd be excluded from many US industry sectors which required domestic hosting. This will change shortly (can't say more) and when it does we'll be working to put in place the necessary coverage/compliance certificates to expand into these sectors.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick",1291558804

If you are tripped, step on the group poorly, lose your breath, get the wind knocked out of you, etc., it behooves you to dive and try to convince the ref to stop the game (often convincing the other team to kick the ball out). While you wouldn't be able to sub immediately either, players try to make their injuries seem more severe to get more recovery time, knowing they'll have to perform in full form when they get up.\nOpen substitution would make it so the players would have to accurately convey to their <i>coaches</i> whether or not they should be substituted.

This wouldn't be very much of a problem if the application weren't openly described by its authors as one whose sole purpose is spying on the phone's user. So why make a big deal out of it!?<p>!! The article makes a big deal of the fact that some applications have requested the same set of permission that some spyware apps have. I can think of no conceivable specific combination of permissions that alone would give much information at all about whether or not an app is spyware. It also makes a big deal of how nine applications can brick the phone without going into any detail about the nominal purpose of these apps (i.e. does it make sense that such an app behaving as described in the market entry for this app should need to brick the phone).<p>! This article seems to imply that one would need any of these permissions to harm the user.

(I could be wrong on this one.)<p>!!! Any app that requests two of the permissions they label as sensitive is marked as suspicious. This means that any app wanting to both access the internet and do any of the following is considered suspicious according to this study:<p>- Access coarse location.<p>- Write to the external storage.<p>- Send an SMS.<p>!

Sure you may have handed it to someone else, but to say it is no longer your data just because it was handed to Facebook is like saying that you no longer have a Social Security Number when you provide it on a form to a bank (for example) or that when you are the victim of identity theft that you literally no longer have an identity.<p>Now, one should probably act as if handing their data to one person was like handing it to the world, but there are obviously limits.

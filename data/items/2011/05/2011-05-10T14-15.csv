They simply won't represent a big enough chunk of the market to seriously threaten the traditional publishers.<p>><i>What will happen though is that some of them will be self-published and more importantly the mid-list will probably be taken over by self-publishers. So as a publisher your portfolio now has a higher percentage of decade-long bets and they have to pan out for you to stay in business.</i><p>Even if all first-time best-sellers go the self-publishing route, they are a small enough segment of best-sellers that their loss will not be crippling to traditional publishers.  All but a very few mid-list authors also go through the same process of growing (except that they plateau before achieving best-seller status), so the traditional publishers won't lose many of them, either.  Even if they <i>did</i> lose all of the mid-list authors, though, I don't think it would hurt the traditional publishers all that much because they don't really make much money from mid-list authors.  Traditional publishing houses keep the mid-list authors onboard because they don't <i>lose</i> money, and because there is always a chance, however slim, that they might someday tranform into best-sellers.  Limiting traditional publishers to nothing but decade-long bets won't really hurt them <i>because that is already where all of their profits are concentrated</i>.  Mid-list authors are just a byproduct of a process designed to occasionally pop out a chart-topping superstar.<p>As self-publishing really takes hold, I think that the career path for a typical mid-list author will look something like this: <i>Start out by selling a (mediocre, money-losing) first book to a traditional publisher.  Show enough potential to get signed for a multi-book deal.  Write enough books to fulfill the contract, never doing poorly enough to be cut loose early, but never making the best-seller list, either.  After fulfilling the contract, transition to self-publishing.</i>  Losing a mid-list author to self-publishing won't really hurt the publishing company, but cutting out the middle-man will help the author immensely.<p>><i>So we do agree that prices will be pushed down?</i><p><i>Mean</i> prices will almost certainly go down, but that doesn't mean that <i>all</i> prices will go down.  I actually think that prices for best-sellers might very well go <i>up</i>: the center of the distribution will move towards lower prices, but the best-selling tail will stretch out far enough to more than make up for that shift.<p>><i>Can we at least agree that self-publishing is a long-term threat for publishing houses? You don't think it will wipe them out, I think that at least the existing ones will get replaced by new firms that understand the new dynamics better.</i><p>It depends on what you mean by ""long-term threat.""  I agree that their profits will be reduced, but reduced profits are not inherently disruptive.  Industries adapt to such changes all of the time, even ones that supposedly can't survive any further reduction in margins.  <i>Some</i> of the traditional publishing companies will almost certainly fail to adapt and go out of business, but others will most likely adapt and survive, possibly even thrive in the new environment.  The only thing that could completely destroy all of the traditional publishers would be if somebody else came along and provided the still-valuable service they currently provide, but more effectively and/or at lower cost.<p>I think that one possible business model would be incubator-style publishers: small teams of editors and marketers who ""invest"" in up-and-coming authors.  A typical contract might be something along the lines of, ""We will edit and market your first book.  You will pay us <i>x</i>% of revenues from any book we edit and market for you.  For the next <i>n</i> years, you will also pay us (<i>x</i>/2)% of revenues from any book we <i>don't</i> edit and market for you, unless you offered us the chance and we declined.""",1305039345

I did it at the time because it was my first go around at starting a business and both of us had no idea what we were doing (basically the ""fear"" element that Mark mentions in this article). Everybody we knew told us not to go 50/50, but we pressed on anyway for lack of any other option.<p>Where it really hurts is in decision making. Things that would take a single founder a few hours or days to mull over can take weeks, months (or even years) to decide. It kills the speed advantage of being a startup. We ended up bringing in a minority partner a couple of years in, but that didn't help since the other two partners were still equal and there was no clear decision maker.<p>There has to be a clear leader, despite equal stakes. In my case, we had an awkward conversation about who should be CEO that went nowhere, and it has hurt us ever since.<p>Mark's post also mentions risk profiles. Right now I am married and have an inexpensive house, but my co-founder has two kids and a new house. Despite best intentions on his part, we have very different risk profiles which impact our decision making.<p>On the flip side, it is great to have the support of someone else there when you're going through the ups and downs of startups.

If you don't like symbols, you don't like math. If you are illiterate in symbols you are illiterate in math.<p>The word is often used imprecisely, though. Because so many real-world problems can be translated into math, there is a temptation to equate ""math"" with ""any problem that can be expressed in math"". Thus you frequently see poetic statements like ""my cat is great at solving differential equations"", or ""music is math because it's all about harmonic series and Fourier analysis"". But these things aren't literally true. You can put a bucket under a flowing faucet, and it will collect all the water, but that isn't really integration. The bucket isn't doing math.<p>And being ignorant of math isn't the same as being stupid. As the OP points out, you can get a lot of quantitative reasoning done without using math. A classic Fun Fact About Math is that it took thousands of years to invent the number zero. And it's true. But that doesn't mean that the ancient Egyptians used to waste hours staring into newly-emptied buckets and baskets in stunned amazement, murmuring ""what on earth is that"" to themselves in Coptic. People understood what ""having no objects"" meant long before there was a <i>symbol</i> for ""the number of objects in an empty basket"". It was the <i>highly abstract symbol</i> ""zero"", and the highly abstract operations involving zero, that had to be invented. [1]<p>It's worthwhile to recognize that interpreting the real world in terms of abstract symbols, and vice versa, is a terribly difficult skill that requires lots of practice. (In my case, I was well through grad school before many bits of physics clicked.) And it's worthwhile to recognize that you can often do without math: You can reason quantitatively without it. Birds do it! Bees do it! But don't pretend that you're doing math unless you are actually doing math. The abstractions <i>are</i> the math.<p>---<p>[1] Or, rather, discovered.

One is everything can be crawled with no way for the site owner to say ""no, please don't crawl this.""<p>The other major one is to legally bar all crawling without express permission.<p>The current de facto world - crawling is OK unless robots.txt says otherwise - is pretty nice. If we want that to be a legal defense in court (""You didn't put up a robots.txt, so my indexing was legal, so you can't sue me.""), which seems useful, then the necessary flipside of that is that violating robots.txt exposes the crawler to liability. That's a tradeoff I'm perfectly willing to accept to allow the web, and necessary services such as indexers and crawlers, to work while still allowing publishers to have some reasonable control over their content distribution.<p>I seem to remember one of the writers at Search Engine Land presenting a nice description of the robots.txt request in contract negotiation terms. Something like this:<p><i>Archiver:</i> ""Are there any limits on what I can archive or index from your site?"" (translation: GET /robots.txt)<p><i>Site:</i> ""Nope."" (translation: 404 Not Found)<p>or<p><i>Site:</i> ""Yep, here they are."" (translation: 200 OK followed by restrictions in robots.txt format)<p>So, by asking for /robots.txt, the crawler can be construed as asking permission to index, and the response setting up the terms of indexing. That seems like a <i>really</i> useful defense and sane compromise in this age of ""indexing so you can drive search users to our content is copyright infringement.""<p>[EDIT: fix formatting]",1305036466

The work/life balance there is much more reasonable.<p>Kill it doing your 40 hours, and no one will have any complaints with you. If you're REALLY passionate about entrepreneurship, you won't be there for more X years anyway (different for each person) so making a 30 year career out of it doesn't really matter.<p>Again, these exist -- just filter through opportunities correctly and stay confident. If you do good work, you shouldn't have any problem finding such a fit.<p>And with these gas prices, a unicorn would be sweet too. I'll google what's available later.",1305036025

I also use Dropbox but that's more for collaboration than backup. I occasionally boot with up with my OSX CD and use Disk Utility to do a complete disk clone of my solid state laptop drive onto the original factory 2.5"" DeathStar drive. My projects live in git and are pushed to GitHub and Email and contacts live at google and sync to my iPhone via their active sync implementation.<p>For my windows machines I used to use Mozy but it does not stay out of the way as well as CrashPlan so if I cared at all about what was on my windows computers anymore I would probably use CrashPlan there as well.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.crashplan.com/consumer/crashplan-plus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.crashplan.com/consumer/crashplan-plus.html</a>",1305036007

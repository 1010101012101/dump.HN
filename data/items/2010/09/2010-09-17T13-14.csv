I'm not saying that there's a market for a ""web-based"" experience - I just think Android already fills that gap.<p>There are very few cases in where having ChromeOS would be superior to a device with Android. Flash? Flash seems to be a processor issue. Android has Flash, and it should get better as mobile chips get more powerful. The whole flash thing may be moot if HTML 5 really takes off.<p>Printing?

1701083,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"Some points:<p>- It's annoying in this day and age to be forced into using the entire MS Stack when I need to work with one specific technology. For example: if I want to test a web app on various versions of IE, I have to run Windows. OK fine, even though IE is the only browser that is tied to one OS, I'll let that go. However, if I want to use the Microsoft-provided free MS Virtual Machine images, I have to run them on Virtual PC despite the fact that I have a perfectly good VMWare installation. On my Mac, this means running windows on VMWare, and then Virtual PC inside that virtual machine. This is insanity. I'm trying to support your product, you should be making it as easy as possible for me. Even Apple ported Safari to Windows. As a developer, this just makes me feel hostile to MS. Another case: MS SQL Server. It's a real bear to connect to it from unix since (last I checked) there are no official drivers. You have to use some unix ODBC open source stuff and it's just not suitable for production work. My organization has a huge SQLServer instance I can't use because the Linux support is brittle. Contrast that with Oracle who has official drivers for practically every OS under the sun. The Windows for everything attitude has got to change. MS is a software company, not a Windows company. I know MS doesn't have a strong history of ""playing nice with others"", but it's sorely needed.<p>- Figure out a way to get corporate IT departments into regular upgrade cycles. The fact that lots of stubborn companies refuse to upgrade because the costs (perceived or real) are high is madness. It's a drag on the whole Microsoft ecosystem and heavily rate-limits the cycle time for new products.<p>- The segmentation of different Windows versions is just silly. There should be one version of Windows and that's it. It's simple for people to understand and it makes licensing a breeze. Artificially creating different versions doesn't really help anyone. Having a server and a desktop version is plenty (since they are genuninely different).<p>- MS needs to really decide how much longer they want to push an OS that is based on Windows/DOS heritage and not unix. I know this is tantamount to heresy inside MS. But if you look objectively at how Apple has used open source and unix, you see they are able to get incredible leverage for their size. Not having do to everything in-house and relying on the broader community is pretty good business for them. It lets them focus on the places where they can add value. At some point, it's not efficient for MS to maintain a parallel universe of ""invented here"" stuff. A proprietary Windows GUI/userspace on top of a unix core (like Mac OS) could really revitalize the whole Windows brand if done properly. It might even draw some geeks back from Mac OS. I became a Mac user because I was tired of dual booting Linux and Windows. I like having first-class email, word processing, photo sharing, etc... but I also want the unix underpinnings for my software development and scientific computing needs. Geeks aren't a big market by themselves, but they really make an impact on the decisions of others.",1284730710

MS has worked on these boring enterprise products for 15 years already, and buying RIM and developing Office is more of the same. I can't foresee any new tech coming from these boring strategies.<p>MS's ceiling for mobile market share is 2nd place. This isn't a bad outcome, but to accomplish this MS needs to keep WP7 locked down (so it can compete with the carrier-garbage versions of Android we see now). Who knows? I don't think they're out to ""win"" consumer mobile; they want to participate in it, pick up good market share, and try to develop brand synergy.<p>Anyway, MS is an enterprise company at their core, so their performance in consumer mobile isn't a big deal.

The main reason for that is I'm simply not the target audience for their flag ship products, but I also want to avoid getting locked into a platform that depends on the whim of a company with vastly different interests from my own. For the same reason I'm increasingly moving away from Apple products. So it would be a bad business decision for Microsoft to change the way their software works for the small minority of users like me.<p>That being said, some of Microsofts products are very solid on a technical level and much better documented than their open source counterparts. My impression of .NET, for example, is very positive, although limited to Mono. It seems like they are moving in the right direction with IE as well and I've heard good things about MSSQL (or whatever it is called these days). They got a lot of credibility for IronPython and IronRuby, too. What happened to IronRuby ruins that good will, though.<p>The problem is that I'm afraid to touch ""the good parts"" that come out of Microsoft for anything beyond playful experimentation. In my opinion, that is a wasted opportunity. With Oracle ruining everything Sun built Microsoft has a great opportunity to eat market share away from Java. Why aren't they donating the IP related to .NET to the Apache Foundation, for example? That would make .NET a viable platform for me (practically, not necessarily technically). Developers used to be forced to work with Microsoft because that was were the market was, but with modern browser technology we don't need them anymore. So the next best thing they can do is make us willing to work with technologies like .NET.<p>One more thing. Ten years ago, when I permanently left their platform, my opinion of Microsoft was bordering on hate. These days I see them, and Google, as one of the more reliable big tech companies, miles ahead of Apple and Oracle. Maybe that has something to do with not being directly exposed to Windows anymore, but I do get the impression that their reputation is improving.<p>P.S. Theoretically, there are a lot of things I would love to see from Microsoft, like donating technologies like DirectX to the Apache Foundation so it would be easier to run games on GNU/Linux or making Windows a thin layer on top of BSD, but I don't realistically expect them to do anything like that.",1284730582

1700998,comment,1700623,1700623,0,0,OmarIsmail,,,"First let me say that I'm a big user of MS technology, I actually one of the few that calls myself an MS fanboy. Xbox owner since 2001, Xbox Live subscriber since 2002, coding in .NET with VS since 2005, Windows machines, etc etc. However I own an iPhone and an iPad. They are the best in class for what they offer.<p>Here's a very very practical idea that MS can implement very soon:
Xbox Live App Store. MS already has 40+ million 360's connected to people's televisions. You have the Indie Game section, and there are some non-games there, but the quality is pretty poor. First off, broaden the scope officially to ""Apps"" and make them a first class citizen in the dashboard. Market the area, support the area. Just look at what Apple is doing with the iTunes app store and iteratively improve upon that. Also, give indy developers access to Kinect libraries ASAP. Essentially with Kinect, you can do to the TV what Apple did to the Phone - made the advanced ""smart"" capabilities accessible to everyone. And open it up to developers in a big way because you don't have the resources to make everything yourself. I really can't stress how cool this would be, and how game changing it would be for the ""set top box"" experience.<p>Here are a few ""big"" ideas that I'd like from MS that are more out there:
1) an all you can eat digital media subscription. I would pay up to $100/month to be able to watch any movie (in HD), play any game (PC or 360), read any book I want to, or listen to any music anytime that I want on any device I want. I don't care to own anything or build up any collections. I just want to be able to consume the media that I want to in a ridiculously convenient way that is actually reasonably affordable.<p>2) Where my physical person is my representation in meatspace, my facebook profile is my representation in cyberspace, my phone should be my representation in digital space. When I walk into a room with my phone every device around me should be aware of my phone and extend my phone's functionality. Let me put it this way: my phone contains a display, speakers, camera, etc. If there is a better display in the room then let me use that display instead of my phone's. If there are better speakers in the space then let me use those speakers instead of the phone's. etc. Essentially ""explode"" the phone's physical device into the surrounding better devices so you effectively have a ""super phone"" wherever you are. And subsequently you ""collapse"" the phone when no such compatible devices are around.<p>3) somehow get rid of bandwidth caps. Fast ubiquitous wireless with no bandwidth caps would be amazing
3b) somehow make the above reasonably priced no matter if you're ""roaming"" in another country or whatever<p>Now for minor complaints:
1) Windows sucks for battery life. OSX is awesome for battery life. This is one of the major reasons why Apple can make decently powerful laptops in a nice form factor.
2) WHY do I have to reboot my computer for every damn little update? It severely impacts my enjoyment of my Windows computers.",1284729389

It's great at doing fancy stuff with data structures in memory, but memory on a single node is all you get.  (Dumping memory to disk improves durability, but does nothing for capacity.)  If you want more cache than that, then you'll have to add your own clustering.  Memcached itself is not any better, actually.  At the very least you'll need to add libketama to consistent-hash across several memcached instances.  Even better would be to use something like Kumofs or Voldemort which provide roughly the same semantics - Kumofs even uses the same protocol - while also handling server-set changes and such transparently.<p>That brings me to the point about whether to implement a separate caching layer at all.  Why?  Is there some known or inevitable performance need that wouldn't be solved by having enough cache on the nodes serving the authoritative data?  If not, then implementing interfaces to two different layers - with all of the consistency problems and impedance mismatches involved - will just be a waste.  My general advice is to never add a tier unless you're absolutely and empirically sure that the pain your gaining won't outweigh the pain you're avoiding.<p>>I also figured I'd need to write some scripts to have nodes join and leave the clusters, mostly calling the Apis built into the components of the stack<p>Writing those scripts can be a significant part of implementing your own cluster infrastructure.  I'm sure we could have an interesting discussion about whether writing those scripts would be easy or hard, but IMO the more pressing question is whether they need to be written at all.  If your storage layer (e.g. BigCouch) already does its own clustering, then you need to do practically nothing at that level.  If you then  keep your front-end servers as stateless as possible (i.e. not storing any persistent/shared data other than in the primary data store) then adding/removing those servers should be a complete no-brainer.  Just give them some addresses and credentials, and boom - no cluster magic necessary.<p>It's not components I'm recommending so much as a pattern that avoids the need for so many components, but I hope it's still useful.

Get rid of .NET. There are people who use it, and some of them actually like it, but it will never become the huge success you thought it would become. This also means Silverlight has to go.

Don't wait for W3C, if it's up to them we will have to wait till 2019 for a complete HTML5 specification.

Make the browser the default UI layer of Windows.

It seems to me that you won't see any netbooks labeled Google - you'll see them marketed as ""Acer"", ""Asus"", or ""Dell"".<p>Focusing on the web experience and printing (to combine your reply to my other comment) seems like a very narrow niche to me. It seems like ChromeOS is trying to position itself between Android and something like Windows 7.<p>Surfing the web and wanting to print is a common use case - but in that example, why would I want a device that does that, but not get a full fledged computer? I can't even install my own apps! Why would I need the capability to print - yet buy a device that pretty much requires me to be online all the time?<p>It just seems very risky to me. Why not add a printing function to Android? Wouldn't it be cool if you could hook up your phone and connect it to a printer and print? Wouldn't Android devices have ""proper"" flash if they had more powerful processors? (which is a function of mobile processors getting more powerful)?",1284728495

Perfect example of the comment upvoted by people searching for approval. Articles from daringfireball.net have <i>zero</i> insight? Biased to extremes? Really?

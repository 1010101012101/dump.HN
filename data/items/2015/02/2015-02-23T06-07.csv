He says that this isn&#x27;t hearing and concludes that this somehow makes it irrelevant. This is ridiculous because it doesn&#x27;t matter HOW it affects perception.

Joking about what is, or isn&#x27;t treasonous, is to my way of thinking in just as much poor taste as joking about sexual orientation or race.</i><p>Honestly, I use to feel the same way as you but.... I&#x27;ve begun to realize that jokes about serious matters is actually one form of communication to spread awareness about an issue, relief some social-stresses and it also serves as social-indicator. Like, if someone were to ask me <i>&quot;When could we consider the problem of racism mostly solved?&quot;</i> My answer would be, <i>&quot;When you stop seeing racist jokes/comments in youtube comments of any vid with minorities in it and when Louis CK&#x27;s racist jokes don&#x27;t make the audience laugh anymore.&quot;</i> The jokes are not the cause of the problem, they&#x27;re the indicator that the problem still exists. btw, same thing for gangsta-rap music. People say it causes problems in the African american community; I say gangsta-rap music is so popular because a lot of African americans can relate to it. Every black person in USA, including myself, can talk about instances of racism endured and/or the struggles in low-income areas of America. When that&#x27;s no longer the case, they&#x27;ll stop buying it then it&#x27;ll stop being made.<p>That said, there&#x27;s definitely a time & a place for those kinds of jokes and it requires some tact to understand where & when it&#x27;s appropriate.",1424674380

However, Superfish was reportedly bundled with other applications as early as 2010. This software intercepts users’ web traffic to provide targeted advertisements.  In order to <i>intercept encrypted connections</i> (those using HTTPS), the software installs a trusted root CA certificate for Superfish. <i>All browser-based encrypted traffic to the Internet is intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted</i> to the user’s browser by the application – <i>a classic man-in-the-middle attack.</i>  Because the certificates used by Superfish are signed by the CA installed by the software, the browser will not display any warnings that the traffic is being tampered with.  Since the private key can easily be recovered from the Superfish software, an attacker can generate a certificate for any website that will be trusted by a system with the Superfish software installed.  <i>This means websites, such as banking and email, can be spoofed without a warning from the browser.&quot;</i><p>(Emphasis added.)",1424674224

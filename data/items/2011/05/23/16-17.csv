IANAC [1], but I believe this has something to do with unused vacation leave being charged as outstanding debt. It's also a way of saving money by shutting down operations at a time when less gets done anyway.<p>Sun, like most companies, did give the option of taking the leave without pay and preserving your vacation time.<p>Maybe that's one option for US companies - <i>pay</i> for two weeks of vacation time, but culturally allow up to six without pay.  Then we'd actually be somewhat more like European countries, but with an option - reduce your salary if you'd like more vacation, but keep working and make more money if that's more your style.<p>I doubt I'll see this happen - first, ""leave without pay"" is unusual in the US, typically done medical conditions where the employee wants to return to the job, but will be forced to leave for long periods of time (pregnancy leave is often handled this way).  Another problem is that it may actually be inefficient - it would create a financial incentive to take minimum vacation time, and a lot of people believe, with some evidence, that workers are less productive this way.<p>[1] IANAAC: I am not an accountant ;)",1306169610

List comprehensions are much easier to read than a multi-line for loop (obviously, though, nesting list comprehensions is A Bad Thing for readability) - they are much simpler. Generators <i>don't</i> add simplicity!? Do you even know <i>why</i> you would use a generator, why does this run:<p><pre><code>    for i in xrange(1, 10000000000000): print i\n</code></pre>\nand this doesn't:<p><pre><code>    for i in range(1, 10000000000000): print i\n</code></pre>\nTo make the range() example run, you <i>have</i> to use generative behavior <i>anyway</i>, in some form or another. Generators are a simple way of expressing that kind of algorithmic behavior.<p>(for the record, this little example is being ran on a machine with 2GB of ram)<p>I know that is a very silly use case for generators, particularly when range() is going to become xrange() anyways - but it is a perfect example of <i>why</i> generative behavior can make things <i>simpler</i>. The trade off is memory vs computation - range() <i>builds the whole list</i> then iterates over it; xrange() <i>generates the next item in the list</i>; use normal list construction when the list is knowably going to be small, use generative behavior when the list is going to be big!<p>Decorators <i>make the language less simple</i>????? A decorator gives you the ability to modify a function/class at <i>runtime</i>. Decorators have made my python code (where they are useful) much much simpler!! Decorators have given me another dimension to follow DRY with!! Decorators do make the <i>implementation</i> more complex but they make the code <i>you write</i> simpler - the trade off is very clear and the cons are almost non-existent.<p>If you think decorators are cool, try picking up Common Lisp or Scheme - Macros will rock your socks off.",1306169393

This isn't just a quantitative difference, it's a revolutionary qualitative difference!<p>Our online infrastructure is <i>broken</i> in ways we're dimly aware of, because it has always been that way.  In the same way that people trying to do business demand network, electric, and roadway infrastructure that once didn't exist, we will someday demand software infrastructure with features that do not exist today.<p>Chief among these will be security features.  If Google plays their cards correctly, they can create an ecosystem that stays ahead of the black-hat hackers.  By correctly incentivizing white-hat hackers, they could expose and patch security holes fast enough to ruin the economics of the black-hats.  This infrastructure will enable Google to make more money, resulting in a virtuous cycle.<p>If the infrastructure can be extended to the server-side, with web app frameworks that receive security updates with equal rapidity, then Google can establish a secure, smoothly running ""toll road"" -- an infrastructure subset relatively free from problems faced by the rest of the net.  That could be worth billions.<p>(We'll know this strategy is winning if/when Microsoft starts doing it too.  Once that happens, we'll be in a new era of computing.)",1306168919

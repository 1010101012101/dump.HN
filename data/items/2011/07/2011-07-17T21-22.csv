2774303,comment,2774001,2774199,11,0,shinratdr,,,"> I feel that Mozilla has made a strategic mistake in switching to a very rapid release schedule.<p>That wasn't the mistake. The mistake was stealing the technical part from Chrome, and not the part that end users love.<p>Trust me, the only reason Chrome's rapid release schedule hasn't garnered this criticism is because 9/10 users couldn't tell you what the current version of Chrome is, much less what it was when they originally installed it.<p>Google, while adopting rapid release, has simultaneously made version numbers irrelevant to anyone except devs and power users. That was the important part. Updates don't matter and they just happen.<p>Mozilla adopted rapid release but kept publicizing each major version like it was a big deal and giving end users ways to opt out other than turning off updates completely. This is a BAD idea.<p>Rapid release needs to come hand in hand with safer, less drastic, and seamless updates. This will never happen until Mozilla overhauls its extensions system because of how deep & old-world it is and how prone extensions are to break during minor updates.<p>It's unfortunate for the NoScript fanatics, but a rapid release schedule simply does not work if you provide this many hesitations. I still see FF3.6 and FF4 everywhere, yet unless the person doesn't run Chrome very often, Chrome is always at 12.x. If it isn't, it will be next time they launch.<p>It's funny, in a way users who clamour for stuff like NoScript are actually putting average users in more danger for their own personal benefit. If Mozilla was allowed to overhaul FF's extension system, updates could be much more seamless and end users would actually end up with the latest version of the program.<p>Instead, we run the gamut from 1.x to 2.x to 3.x to 4.x to 5.x and everything in between. I'm sure anyone who has worked as a desktop tech has somewhat recently encountered a Firefox 1.x/2.x installation here and there, ever catch a Chrome 1? Chrome 3? Chrome 7?

2774267,comment,2773180,2773180,3,0,malandrew,,,"My comments that I posted in the comments on the original blog post, slightly modified:<p>===<p>Quora most certainly does solve a problem: Tacit knowledge extraction<p>I have a question, whose answer may not exist anywhere in written form (e.g. no reference book, no wiki, no manual, no whitepaper, etc.). The answers do however lie in the heads of people, very very smart knowledgable people. Quora has created a system whereby a user with a question can pose it in a forum where those with the answer will see it and feel compelled to answer.<p>Quora is performing tacit knowledge extraction at the macro-level. However, there is no reason that this same problem cant be solve at the institutional level as well, using only a slightly modified version of the solution the Quora team has built.<p>===<p>On the issue of badges and traditional game mechanics, I wholly disagree that Quora needs such features, and I would even argue that it would be a worse product if it did have them. For the most part, the game mechanics you are referring to are almost all behavioral game mechanics, whereby intrinsic motivation is replaced with extrinsic motivation in the form of totems and tokens (badges, mayorships, in-game money, etc.).<p>When you apply extrinsic motivators where intrinsic motivators already exist, you get three results:
(1) An increase in short-to-medium term user engagement, but this comes as a cost of
(2) Losing intrinsic motivators that a difficult to regain once lost, and
(3) A possible loss of contribution quality, because users are now engineering their answers for upvotes and not focusing on answering the original question. Oftentimes these two will be aligned, but not always.<p>The correct type of game mechanics to apply (and that for the most part are already part of Quora in some ways already) are combinatorial game mechanics that dont reward individual achievement, but collaboration and cooperation. These types of game mechanics are far more subtle than the behavioral game mechanics used by companies like Zynga.<p>StackOverflow is unique in that it is largely based on combinatorial game mechanics, with the use of some behavioral game mechanics to guide the user into exploring the webapp. Notice that I said <i></i>exploring<i></i>. As webapps get larger, you need to establish exploration patterns to the app to make sure the user gets the most out of the app. SO uses badges for this. Many other sites use single-use tooltips such as those that can be created with guiders.js. Here they are using extrinsic motivators for a behavior that will only be performed once (exploration by definition is only done once), thus there is no product risk from usurping/deadening the value of intrinsic motivators using extrinsic motivators.<p>There is however one exception on SO where they use behavioral game mechanics to solicit user behavior that should be performed in perpetuity, which is to hand out depth of knowledge badges for contributions to certain topic verticals. There is a serious possible long-term consequence of these badges for tasks in perpetuity, but it may be a long-time before we find out whether the risks outweighs the benefit.<p>For example, SO hands out bronze, silver and gold badges for topic X. This is replacing an intrinsic motivation (helping your fellow developer with the problem; reciprocal altruism) with an extrinsic motivator (bronze/silver/gold badges. A possible consequence of this approach is that some people (how many as a percentage, we dont yet know) may only actively participate in the site until they achieve the badges they want in that vertical as part of their reputation. So the first risk here is the possibility of a drop in topic engagement after the user has achieved all totems for that topic.<p>And example of a better game mechanic, that is typically viewed as traditional game mechanic, but has been implemented in Quora as a combinatorial game mechanic is the notion of a topic leaderboard titled Top Answerers, which I believe is <i></i><i>upvote weighted.</i><i></i>. First, the upvote weighting makes sure that quality of answers is more important than quantity of answers for a topic in determining who is ranked most highly. Second, there are no notifications alerting top answerers that theyve become top answerers. Its not like the user wakes up one day, checks Quora and sees a feed item saying Congratulations, you are now a top answerer for the Javascript topic. Doing so would shift the focus from intrinsic motivation via reciprocal altruism to extrinsic motivation via the fostering of competition among top answerers.<p>Finally, Quoras product management approach of only displaying just enough quantity/quality metrics to the end users prevents misplaced emphasis on competition and PeopleRank. The only places you really see competition metrics in the interface are upvotes on an answer and number of answers in the top answerers leaderboard.<p>I could even be argued that Quora may want to experiment with not listing these two numbers at all. For example, Hacker News recently did away with displaying the number of upvotes alongside topic comments. This removal of competition metric from the interface effectively turns a mixed behavioral/combinatorial game mechanic to a pure combinatorial game mechanic. I forget the exact thread where Paul Graham discussed the benefits of removing upvote count from comments, but the fact that his change has stuck is proof that a combinatorial approach that is subtle and may not look like game mechanics at all to the untrained eye is better than a behavioral approach that rewards undesirable behavior.<p>===<p>Ultimately, Quora is fun for people who would rank highly on high-need-for-cognition. Thats its target audience. It does not and would not want to modify the product to target people with a low need for cognition, since doing so would reduce contribution quality and drive away the users who have a high need for cognition and contribute heavily.<p>References:

However, feed utility is not a problem unique to Quora. Twitter and Facebook both suffer from feed utility issues due to signal to noise ratios in the feeds. This is one of the biggest problems in social network design and each social network, by virtue of catering to a different audience with different needs will have to find their own solutions to improve signal-to-noise. I know, Im working on a startup with a feed with a very focused task and all feed improvements revolve around serving the needs associated with that one task. (FYI Were not in stealth, since if you know me personally, Ill gladly share it with you, but Im not about to post our product design on the web just yet.)<p>On this last problem it may be interesting to have two feeds. A feed of all the stuff I like and find interesting via follows of people and topics. This is the serendipitous, consumption focused feed. And a second feed that includes all the topics that the user contributes most often to. This second feed should help solid contributors get back to contributing instead of having their time sucked up with consumption of all sorts of useful and useless knowledge.",1310938725

A better way to market yourself may be to go out and actually shake hands with people. There is only one problem: getting someone to agree to a face to face meeting carries a higher opportunity cost for them than spending a few minutes reading your blog, so you are less likely to get agreement there.<p>When you combine that fact with the large number of unemployed individuals in traditional industries who would love to get face time with an important person in their industry, it's just not a good idea for a manager, HR guy, or other decision-making individual at a company to agree to meet with each individual who requests a meeting.<p>The basic problem in some older industries is essentially that a person can only demonstrate their skills within the context of a (sometimes large) company. A web developer or a designer can create a website or a blog and show the world how good they are, but a welder or a wind tunnel technician doesn't have the same opportunity. And hiring someone (especially at a large company) can be very expensive with all the benefits, training, and time spent acclimating the new hire to the company and its culture.

At this rate, I might as well just dump Firefox and work inside Chrome.<p>Mozilla needs to slow the hell down and let Extension developers catch up.",1310936938

If you delete their account but keep a log that the account was deleted at the request of email address 'x' mailing you from IP address 'y' and that that user had at the time of deletion logged a grand total of 64 hours on your service over a period of 90 days then that's just fine as far as I read the law.<p>Yes, there is a cost to keeping a free service alive post shutdown. And you probably should factor that cost in to your business plan when you start.  And if maintaining a service in such a way that users can get their data out post shutdown (and possibly a migratory service or a deal with 'web.archive.org' to archive the site, which, ironically may be in violation of several countries' laws) is too expensive then you can wonder if that service is viable to begin with. Typically those costs are a very small fraction of what it would cost to run a service in an active mode.<p>I currently host 3 projects that are officially 'dead', their creators no longer felt that they were going to spend another dime on them and I feel that to do right by the users the small amount of money that it takes to 'keep the lights on' is far outweighed by the benefit to the users.",1310936929

2774196,comment,2772941,2773314,2,0,pgroves,,,"For any new technology (here, the example is social media), there is a natural evolution from closed to open standards. Early on, lots of proprietary code is modified as quickly as possible to see what works well in practice. Some companies win, some lose. An industry group trying to decide what to put in a standard is pointless b/c it's all hypothetical what features will survive the test of time.<p>Eventually, however, an open standards organization should come in and say ""these are the standard features, let's encapsulate them in an open standard that everyone uses."" This has been proven to be a very healthy way to get to an open standard that really works well in practice.<p>In 2011, I believe social media is ready to move to an open standard. The last five to ten years has seen a lot of technology built and verified by trial and error. There certainly has been enough capital investment in social media systems. The basics of what Facebook and Twitter do are a very good start. Something like OStatus can define the basics of what social media is by looking at what really works, which would not have been possible even a few years ago.<p>This is why I'm disappointed in google+. The social media industry is at the point in it's life cycle that it can move to an open standard. Google was in a unique position to ram it through all at once. Instead, they decided to make yet another closed system with minor improvements over the existing competitors. They may win lots of users in the short term but a bigger shift to open standards is coming, but now we have to wait longer for it.",1310936895

Even when there isn't, I think there is some clear standard of fairness (individuals get paid first, including refunding prepaid customer funds, and convertible notes get paid last.  Vendors who have already provided service should probably get paid before continuing to pay on things like the balance of long-term leases; there are legal standards and best practice for all of this, although it probably varies by jurisdiction).<p>The only really bad thing is burning unknowing employees, especially after misleading them about finances.",1310936500

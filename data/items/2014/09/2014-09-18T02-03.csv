8333441,comment,8331381,8332663,1,0,devonkim,,,"As both a developer and admin, it&#x27;s a little hard for me to not think across the aisle. However, I can think of developers that basically refused to think outside their solo - they tend to fit the type of person that really doesn&#x27;t like to go too far outside the bounds of their workday tasks. Not saying that everyone is this way, but you wouldn&#x27;t ask John Carmack to try to think about continuous integration and deployment stuff while he&#x27;s stuck reading physics books and reading a bunch of papers, would you? Yes, good devs tend to have the curiosity and, more importantly, the concern to think beyond just their immediate day to day concerns of hyper focus and in-depth knowledge.<p>Sometimes you just need to hire more people or ask the rest of the team to accommodate someone that&#x27;s that one random oddball. A management book I read mentioned Phil Knight talking about how the Bulls had room for one Dennis Rodman and only one, and made it clear that nobody else can pull the stunts he does without disrupting the harmony.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between a dev that does something a bit out of ignorance and one out of indignance.<p>Some companies have developers spend some time in SRE (I believe Google practices this sometimes) so they can gain some insight, but it may not be the best idea for a lot of orgs. It&#x27;s part of why most orgs that do some form of devops well tend to remove a lot of concerns off the table by using stuff like AWS. Meanwhile, silozation helps people maintain some sanity and focus in larger orgs where there&#x27;s so much BS work on top of your technical duties.<p>Sometimes the culture is short-sighted and people are at odds with goals though. I&#x27;ve been penalized by managers and peers for not paying enough attention to my dev duties (which were pretty meh) when I was busy helping support and sales help bring in and retain $2 million in accounts that they later named me on calls as their informal engineering MVP.<p>But really, being aware of what other people care about in their job is a contentious issue that I mostly think boils down to personality and general ideas of teamwork.",1411008940

8333423,comment,8331381,8332635,6,0,vinceguidry,,,"> I confess I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d apply this to developers. They pass fizzbuzz, OK - what do you do next?<p>I know what I would do, just have a 10 minute conversation with them about technology. I can easily figure out just where a person is in regards to their development as a programmer just by listening to them talk about what they&#x27;re paying attention to in the tech landscape. If they don&#x27;t blink when I mention Hacker News, I know they&#x27;re on the right track. Do they know what Go is, or Haskell? Do they have an opinion about Node.js?<p>These criteria are intended to gauge motivation and enthusiasm in the absence of an impressive track record. If they&#x27;re capable but not highly motivated, then that&#x27;s fine so long as you&#x27;re only hiring them to do stuff inside their comfort zone. We have a Microsoft guy just like that. If they&#x27;re motivated but not capable, then with coaching they&#x27;ll be able to do anything. The best way to discover someone&#x27;s motivation is to get a gander at what they&#x27;re thinking about when they aren&#x27;t working.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for someone who is motivated <i>and</i> capable, you can eventually find someone like that, but you&#x27;ll have a hell of a time keeping them. Developers have so many options these days that you need to have at least 3 of: competitive salary, decent perks, fun work environment, a glamorous field; in order to hold on to them for longer than a year.<p>Most companies are lucky to manage one, if they&#x27;re very lucky two. Since salary is often the easiest thing to manipulate and honestly the most important to the employee, err on the side of paying too much. It&#x27;s expensive but not having competent developers is far more expensive.",1411008600

8333416,comment,8333258,8333308,29,0,pookieinc,,,"Interesting you mark this section of it, this part also stood out to me.<p>As a longtime Apple iPhone lover, I switched over to Google Nexus 5 around 6-8 months ago and with it, I decided to try and be as open as possible with my data. This means that I opted into allowing Google to read my mail, save my Chrome searches (and start using Chrome), saving my notes in Google Keep, and then regurgitate all that information back to me on my Google dashboard. I thought to myself: &quot;Once the next iPhone comes, I&#x27;ll determine if I should go back.&quot;<p>At first, it was striking that one day I booked a flight and then about two weeks later, my dashboard mentioned to me that I should leave 40 minutes early for my flight because of a traffic accident. It knew my flight information, when I should leave, and routes to the airport. I followed Google&#x27;s suggestion and made it to the airport on time, taking an alternate route Google displayed for me. Once I landed, Google updated my dashboard about the currency exchange, surrounding events, restaurant reviews, foreign news, and more... it &quot;knew&quot; I wasn&#x27;t home anymore, but across the world. It was initially strange, but with more trips and more experiences, I grew to like that Google could give me handy data.<p>Another strange thing, when reading my mail, it would point out words like &quot;... On Saturday, Sept. 4...&quot;, then ask me if I wanted to save it to my calendar. Small touches like this grew on me and kept my life in sync.<p>Now, having spent many months with the phone and with the release of iPhone 6, I&#x27;ve come at a crossroads in trying to find out how &quot;okay&quot; I am with giving Google my data. I wonder to myself, &quot;how can Google use this data against me&quot; and come up short. There are things I wish to be private and for those things, they are rare and I use the appropriate channels (Incognito Mode, other email accounts, etc.), but those are much more rare than the typical. It does sometimes bother me that ads show my interests, but other times, I&#x27;ve actually found it surprisingly useful and it has led me to learning about other products available.<p>I suppose for Apple to release this comment, I agree on the one hand and can see their point, but I wonder... Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have certain services available to you, if that means giving some information out.",1411008418

But I&#x27;m not going to stoop so low as to use logical fallacies, because I&#x27;m confident that I&#x27;m on the right side of this particular disagreement. You don&#x27;t seem to be. It&#x27;s worth noting your entire argument is an appeal to authority or a personal attack.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, though, I think that it&#x27;s positive for the NIMH to move away from DSM guidelines for research, because research should inform the DSM, not the other way around. Further, the DSM and mental health as a whole has been trending towards cultural models of mental illness rather than authoritarian mindsets that attempt to proscribe rather than describe.<p>Ironically, the main reason for doing so is the backlash the psychology community suffered from the categorization of homosexuality and gender identity disorder. This is why modern mental illness diagnosis requires an interference with life functioning, as decided by the patient, not the medical establishment. I think this is generally the right way for the community to go in, for a couple of reasons.<p>For one, very few mental illnesses will have an empirically detectable &quot;cause&quot; aside from some combination of experiences. It&#x27;s not clear by any stretch that all mental illnesses have even a biological component. The (empirically detectable) success of cognitive-behavioral therapy seems to indicate that since minds can be built in any number of ways, they can also be broken and need repair purely using their own mechanisms.<p>If someone has PTSD because they were sexually assaulted, it&#x27;s not clear to me that you could ever say with empirical validity (beyond what the DSM already provides you) that they have any disorder. You could be neurologically reductionist, but even if that&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s several years off before that&#x27;s an effective diagnostic mechanism, and even then the original cause of the disorder is far removed from the person&#x27;s life, leaving only... the symptoms.<p>Second, disregarding the subjective distress of the patient is the path towards medicalization of abnormality, just as happened with homosexuality, hysteric personality disorder, etc.. In the extreme cases, legal structures exist to determine if a person is not responsible for themselves. At the end of the day, mental health is inherently socially constructed rather than objective, and you&#x27;re never going to be able to bottom out to something objective.<p>To say that the DSM is devoid of scientific context is simply false; the DSM is written by scientists, based on all available scientific research available at present. It evolves, like everything else does. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any better way to resolve disagreements among scientists than by voting; it&#x27;s worth noting that medicine as a whole merely allows individual practitioners to make their own judgments as opposed to regulating the field, which is a definite trade-off without a clear winner.",1411006141

However, this type of analysis requires a very efficient tracer. We will provide updates on the latter in an upcoming post.<p>2) The speed and efficiency of backtrace generation can affect recovery times. It&#x27;s far more than 50ms for a lot of server-side or embedded applications.<p>3) Large programs today cannot be debugged feasibly (as in, good luck in generating a detailed crash report, your system will likely not have the resources), especially if they&#x27;re time sensitive as well (tracing is the typical approach there). There are engineers out there who have to spend hours just to extract a small memory dump from a single thread.<p>4) Certain classes of bugs are best observed over time and minimizing jitter is important (more on that later as we unveil some features of the advanced tracer and user interface).<p>Less intrusive real-time profiling is interesting to us, but currently only in the context of state leading to a fatal bug (this also includes bugs that involve hanging such as an infinite loop).

However, I&#x27;ve lurked here long enough to realize that there is indeed a hive mind approach to conversations, and once a certain set of commenters starts in, the rest of the crowd follows.<p>My initial post had been voted up several times before the actual FUD on the part of other commenters started, then came the downvote brigade all because the first few replies to me assumed that I didn&#x27;t validate sources in Slackware builds, hence my opinion was worthless and wrong. By the time I corrected that oversight, the horde had already marched through and nothing I could say from there would change any minds, no matter how rational it was. At one point someone actually tried to say that I was wrong because the author&#x27;s sources could be poisoned. The fact that that means both the sources I&#x27;d grab for a manual build and the sources the apt package maintainer would grab were equally poisoned was lost on that commenter. Logic flew out the window in the rush to prove me wrong.<p>I know I&#x27;ll get downvoted to hell for this but I honestly don&#x27;t give a shit.

Then they say that they don&#x27;t want people who are applying for just any job. That&#x27;s just ridiculous because that&#x27;s exactly what they&#x27;re getting. Instead of weeding them out (and why would you?) you&#x27;re targeting the exact group you&#x27;re trying to weed out. Stupid.",1411006013

It is considered to be the top public high school in the city.<p>Anyways, its computer science program is literally one of the best in the country. Currently, every high school student there learns how to use HTML, Python, and Javascript. Those who want to continue their education are able to take an Advanced Placement Java course and then later on three courses:<p>a Graphics programming class where we learn algorithms for creating 3D objects\na Systems level programming class where we learn C\nand a Software Development class where we learn web development and databases and pretty much everything about software.<p>I&#x27;m actually a Stuyvesant graduate of 2014 and I can say that if it weren&#x27;t for Stuyvesant & Zamansky, I would not have been confident enough to teach myself so many things about programming and work towards my dreams.

I&#x27;ll leave the research part to fine people like you.<p>As for benchmarks, I&#x27;ve seen differences at different sample sizes during training. The model seems to do better with more training examples. Though that increases the number of features and the dimension of the vectors when calculating cosine similarity.

Because code is generally designed to be accessed as linear text without hyperlinking facilities, the identification of the range is usually something that the reader has to interpret by applying (sometimes language specific) conventions relating to code formatting, indentation, and the precise placement of comments, and there are a limited set of kinds of spans that conventions cover (e.g., a span that starts in one block but extends to include the following part of the containing block doesn&#x27;t have a good layout convention to indicate that a comment goes with it.)<p>Genius-style annotations, because they aren&#x27;t limited to conventions that work in a strict linear text medium, can easily refer to arbitrary spans of content.",1428446906

For sure, it&#x27;s healthy for the organization to help their employees (often the more senior and experienced) achieve their life goals of starting a family.<p>But should startups be required to do the same? Is it discrimination if they don&#x27;t? This is where it gets blurry.<p>Let&#x27;s say me and a friend start working on something. Someone is being considered as a potential co-founder. During the vetting period, I learn that they are about to become a parent, and will need certain logistical allowances for the next 6-18 months. I decide to pass on this person - at this stage in the company (very early), everyone needs to be able to hustle long hours. I can&#x27;t risk having a cofounder not put in the sweat. Dead weight kills startups. So to me passing seems fair.<p>Keep in mind I didn&#x27;t even mention if the company was incorporated; if it wasn&#x27;t, surely you can&#x27;t call this &quot;discrimination&quot; in a legal sense. Two guys just decided not to partner with a third person. If it was just incorporated yesterday and I make this decision, do things realistically change? The company is at pretty much the same point - 2 people who need more that can work long, hard hours.<p>But what if we&#x27;re now 5 people and one key employee stops pulling their weight because of family obligations? I don&#x27;t have the resources to support them in this manner, so I either have to let them go or keep on the dead weight. The first option reads like &quot;discrimination&quot;, while the second seriously messes up my startup (imagine I could replace him with a similar skillset person).<p>And you could think of the same scenario at 10 people, 15, 30, 50, 100, etc.<p>As final food for thought,<p>> The American workplace has always prized people who prioritize work over family, and European countries have long had more generous policies for working parents. But in the last two decades, that gap has widened significantly. Other developed countries have expanded benefits like paid parental leave and child care, while the United States has not.<p>Yes, but who&#x27;s leading the world in technological growth? Certainly I can&#x27;t claim causation either way, but simple logic implies that more work means more growth and tech.<p>Scanning through the comments, it seems like the readership here would rather re-balance this in favor of more benefits and less work (thus meaning less growth and tech). Remember you don&#x27;t get to have all of both.<p>So that&#x27;s great and all, but are you justified in trying to impose this upon Silicon Valley? SV started like this because a bunch of people with the opposite opinions got together so they could work hard and drive progress as much as possible - sacrificing in the process. Should they leave, or should you? I suppose the answer is to vote for the political representatives that support your world view.<p>However, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;d be a bad thing, on a moral level, to enact policy against the SV hard work culture. I worry that too much lobbying will result in restricted options for employers and entrepreneurs which would ultimately drive progress down. I believe technological progress is a moral issue; we need our high-performers and hard-workers to cure diseases, combat food scarcity, create better hardware, etc. And we need a place where they can congregate.",1428446807

What you&#x27;re missing is the fact that only an enlightened being knows how to make others be enlightened and only an enlightened being can give a teaching which can be practiced in order to obtain enlightenment.<p>Let&#x27;s say you want to learn how to fix cars… how can you learn such a thing? There are only two possible sources of the necessary information. One of them is much faster: learn from mechanics. The second one is not usually possible for ordinary people to undergo: learn from the world. In both cases, you&#x27;ll be looking at the principle and problems concerning cars.<p>Is it possible to learn how to fix cars from people who /only/ like cars but do not know anything about them? No. The best they can do is encourage you to find someone who really does know about how cars work and what kinds of problems and causes of problems they have. But encouragement from those who do not know anything is not an essential cause for enlightening oneself. If it were, wouldn&#x27;t we have more than just one or two enlightened masters in our history? Please note my usage of the term, &quot;cause&quot;.<p>To me, it&#x27;s quite clear that people hear what they want. There were different types of people that had interest in Buddha while he was alive, but few of them were genuinely interested in his teaching, itself. Most people had their own, individual aims for associating with him, like curing their diseases or becoming wealthier.<p>You suppose that those who adhere to religions might know perhaps a small percentage about enlightenment. But if they did, they would be able to tell me what the basic teaching of the enlightened being is. That&#x27;s like learning the number 1 when you start learning math. But the reality is that the only answers they can give are those they read in books written by others who are not enlightened. It&#x27;s hard for you to believe me unless you travel with me and meet people. Unfortunately, if you have no intention to confirm the veracity of my words, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be interested in judging those cases with your own eyes either.<p>> But this warning has been transmitted -- through religions. And clearly this warning is a teaching that must be viewed as useful for enlightenment.<p>Have you ever heard of the telephone game? If not, have you ever tried to make photocopies of a photocopy? The fidelity of the signal degrades due to the inclusion of noise.<p>The level of any monks and religious adherents has not been high enough to preserve the quality of truth which was in the teaching of the real enlightened being. As a matter of fact, most of the teachings have been completely changed, and intentionally so.<p>In reality, spiritual teachings are rather like food for the consciousness. A fresh apple is quite nourishing, no? (Well, it used to be, a hundred years ago!) But if the apple goes bad, to eat it would be quite bad for you. Like eating a poisonous substance. Similarly, learning and practicing the deteriorated teachings will damage your consciousness. Perhaps if you&#x27;ve got quite a strong will, it will take up to a year. But those of weaker will fall into danger much more quickly upon contact.<p>So the problem is not that a person of sound spirit can&#x27;t recognize that a rotten apple probably used to be a fresh apple and can then have a fair opportunity to judge whether or not they want to eat it. The problem is that a person of sound spirit can be harmed into losing their own consciousness through contact with religious teachings and they are not informed that such things are even bad for them. If you have a connection with religious teachings that claim to be about enlightenment, it is a direct cause to damage your ability to see and transmit the truth. They make you go in the exact opposite way of enlightening yourself and only generate more bad &#x27;karma&#x27;, rather than diminishing the influence of that karma. But it is absolutely imperative to be able to stop your karma in order to achieve an enlightenment, because you cannot enter samadhi if your karma can act. Its habit is to control you. Just because you do not want to have bad karma doesn&#x27;t mean that it will disappear. Karma can only be suppressed by correctly learning and making yourself aware of &#x27;what is&#x27; at all times. It cannot be suppressed by an escape into fantasy, nor by making attempts not to think about anything, regardless of how temporarily peaceful you feel after having done so. It constitutes an intentional lie on the part of monks that they leave out the result of practicing meditation when they borrow Buddha&#x27;s name and teach meditation to others. Suppose that a living Buddha came to the world? Those who would be the most afraid of him are the monks. But they&#x27;re comfortable with a Buddha&#x27;s statue within their temple because a dead Buddha doesn&#x27;t speak, and cannot make any critique of their behavior. He just smiles at them. This only reinforces and is interpreted of encouragement of their hypocrisy.<p>I mention modern Buddhism as an example. I hope that you can catch my meaning through the example, so that, suppose you&#x27;re really interested, you can apply it to other cases which you think may exist in the world and check for yourself whether they do or do not have the same fundamental kind of problems.<p>> A stronger form of this -- that the things that must be understood for enlightenment cannot be properly transmitted -- is also a religious teaching. (see, e.g., the opening of the Tao Te Ching.)<p>I&#x27;m sorry to say that I can&#x27;t verify whether Lao-tzu actually said or meant that. I would need his exact words, or closer to them, in order to check. But to tell you the truth, it&#x27;s not the case that the things for understanding enlightenment can&#x27;t be properly transmitted, as you have suggested.<p>It&#x27;s quite simple for me to do it. I can prove it anytime, on the spot. However, even if I tell you the truth or teachings about enlightenment right here, can you understand them? Only a truthful person can recognize and understand the truth. Those who are untruthful don&#x27;t want the truth revealed.<p>Have you heard of Lao-tzu&#x27;s explanation on the three levels of people? He said that their level of cultivation of virtue can be seen through how they react when they hear the truth. Only those of a high level of cultivation of virtue react with delight when they hear the truth and try quite a lot to put it to practice. Those of the middle level seem to understand, but as a result, they don&#x27;t really apply it. Meanwhile, those of low level can only ridicule the truth.",1428446778

ML is not completely ideal (because it&#x27;s not that compute-intensive), but MC simulations often are.  Most things are <i>not</i> ideal for GPUs, especially since it&#x27;s often not obvious how to nicely scale across GPUs.  MPI&#x27;s strongest point is that it lets you take very good advantage of any topology of general-purpose computers: multicore, NUMA, distributed-memory.  Models that emphasize data-parallel programming (co-array fortran, etc) suit GPUs much better.  But nothing is going to change the fact that GPU registers are much faster than GPU (card) memory, which is faster than any possible interconnect.",1428444331

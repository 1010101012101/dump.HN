His claim is a blatantly dishonest one.<p>> In reality, those in the best position to make money take all they can get, with no scruples about their working-class victims, because taking, in the minds of the rich, serves as a model for success.<p>It's deceptive to simply say ""paying less taxes"" == ""taking.""<p>It's true that if corporations pay low taxes, it's not fair for the middle class and small businesses to pay high taxes. But why jump to the conclusion that we need to raise corporate taxes, instead of lower everyone's taxes? (I'll leave answering that question as an exercise for the reader.)<p>Why are Paul Buchheit's ideas about how to spend _my_ money, more valid than my own?

It's not as trivial as it seems though, since it will require running additional XMPP server on the pod. Another option is to allow using external XMPP accounts for the web UI.<p>Having a chat is not really the highest priority, since there are tons of federated XMPP servers around already, and standalone XMPP clients that are light years better and feature rich than any possible web UI.

There is too much horse shit to respond to, so here are just three points from the first few paragraphs.<p>-----
Perhaps Ayn Rand never anticipated the impact of unregulated greed on a productive middle class.
-----<p>Rand observed that regulations are created by the financially and politically powerful to restrain and oppress the individuals trying to improve their lot in life and change the world. Also, we live in a very heavily regulated economy, leftist delusions of persecution not withstanding.<p>-----
Ayn Rands philosophy suggests that average working people are takers.
-----<p>No, Objectivism suggests no such thing. In fact, in the opening scenes of Atlas Shrugged, the character Eddie Willers admires a bus that is being ""expertly driven"". Under Objectivist philosophy, you are virtuous when you put forth the best within yourself. A plumber can be, and often is, more morally virtuous than a CEO.<p>""Takers"" or ""moochers"" are not ""working people"". They are individuals who, through coercion or deception, consume more than they produce.<p>-----
Perhaps she never understood the fairness of tax money for public research and infrastructure and security, all of which have contributed to the success of big business.
-----<p>You are right, she didn't understand the fairness of the coercive taking of money from one set of people who's only crime is to produce value, only to hand that money over to another set of people whose only claim is that they need it. Atlas Shrugged, through numerous sub-plots and character development, explain how Rand is staunchly opposed to corporate welfare. Also, Rand is not an advocate of ""big business"", and nearly all of the villains in Atlas Shrugged are CEOs.",1369018557

We already know things like whole milk better provides satiation and sateity than skim milk, and children that drink whole milk actaully have less obesity than skim milk drinkers.<p>If we just measured and labeled foods with a sateity/satiation index (what we really care about), then people would actually have a chance to pick better foods.  Right now it is damn near impossible to determine if eating eggs and bacon for breakfast is more likely to drive over eating vs cereal.  It can be measured, but we just don't do it.",1369015468

Government advice and regulation about healthy eating has likely been a contributing factor to a huge explosion in chronic disease. Enough is enough, improve and expand mandatory food labeling and stay out of the rest.<p>Meanwhile, no one should market anything to kids, if you really think about it.",1369015432
5735416,comment,5732872,5734773,1,0,ntrepid8,,,"Ha, this was one of my prior ""failures"" but being an introvert is not a ""failure"" per se.  Shortlisted was designed to consume any information an organization had about an employee plus a 1 to 10 rating about the value of each employee to the organization.<p>The algorithm would then perform a step-wise regression on all the data and ""distil"" it down to a model of attributes that correlate with performance to that specific business, not in general.  So being an introvert might be great for some business cases but may not correlate well with success in every case.<p>After the model was built, the second step in Shortlisted is to take another huge chunk of data and look for new employees that had attributes that correlate well with success for the business.<p>So a typical use case might be your company hires 10 engineers out of college per year.  Out of those ten you can rank them in approximately highest to lowest in terms of value to the company.  Shortlisted takes everything you know about those 10 (plus any from previous years, it really takes about 30 data points to produce meaningful results) and searches the University for more people like the most valuable employees and tries to avoid people like the least valuable.<p>Our goal was to help job seekers avoid situations that not going to be a good fit, and help employers find new hires that had a high likely hood of success.",1369015426

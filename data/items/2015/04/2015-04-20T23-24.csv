The real question is what happens when you deference a null pointer with &#x27;->&#x27;.  He doesn&#x27;t show us what the spec says on that, meaning there&#x27;s a gap in his logic, leaving the quoted sentence in bold unsupported.  I don&#x27;t know but would bet that bolded sentence isn&#x27;t even necessary.  The undefinedness probably comes from the silence of the spec on what happens when you dereference a null pointer with &#x27;->&#x27;.<p>As he showed, a null pointer cannot point to any object, and since a lvalue that does not designate an object gives undefined behavior, saying &#x27;* podhd&#x27; would clearly give undefined behavior when &#x27;podhd&#x27; is a null pointer.<p>However, instead of &#x27;* podhd&#x27; evaluating to a non-existant object, we have &#x27;podhd->line6&#x27; asking for the object some particular offset from a non-existant object.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that a sufficiently insane spec might actually define such an operation.<p>What the spec says on that point is the key.  That&#x27;s where the undefinedness must come from, but he doesn&#x27;t talk about it or quote from the spec on &#x27;->&#x27;.  He just assumes it, which leaves his original point unproven, even if it is correct.<p>So why would anybody want to define legal behavior for dereferencing a null pointer with &#x27;->&#x27;?  Well, some people start college funds for children who have yet to be conceived.  If non-existant people can have account balances, why can&#x27;t non-existant objects have properties?

9411536,comment,9409794,9410149,0,0,benjaminmhaley,,,"> why many middle eastern countries generate so many young angry jihadists<p>This is akin to wondering why Europeans generated so many young angry crusaders. The term jihadists denotes a religion and a region. Its associated with Middle Eastern countries by definition. Angry young militants from other religions and regions are given different names.<p>If we look at objective measurements of violence, like murder rate by country [1], we can see that the Middle East is not particularly violent, rather its on par with America. It is harder to find meaningful information on militarism. We do know that the Middle East was host to 3 of the 4 world conflicts that killed more than 10,000 people in 2014 [2]. All of these conflicts have included significant foreign and local involvement. Their causes are complex. In my opinion, they are driven by a desire to control the world&#x27;s most valuable  resource (Oil!) not by cultural factors.<p>Finally, it is worth noting that Americans use the word Jihad to mean holy war, but in the Middle East the word does not have the same violent meaning [3].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intention...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflict...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad#Current_usage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihad#Current_usage</a>",1429573986

Reads from it are memory mapped, but writes generally require feeding peripheral registers with commands, hence the latency sensitive read-modify-write. Some ARM microcontrollers do have more direct methods though, some of Freescale&#x27;s Kinetis range have a feature called EzPort, where you hold a pin low on boot and it pretends to be SPI flash instead, and tiny 8 bit micros like the AVR all have something similar as full JTAG would be too big for them.<p>>If so you likely know this but you have to load the FPGA with a program to load the flash with the program you want the FPGA to load on reboot. Each of these programs have to be compiled and tested per chip.<p>Yeah, this is what I meant by having code run on the &quot;target&quot;, this being the microcontroller you are programming. You are right in thinking this means the JTAG dongle no longer needs to know how to program flash itself, but it still needs to code to load in and instructions on how to do it (setting up clocks etc), which are also very platform specific. You could do the same for external flash, but its often easier just to connect to it directly and bypass the microcontroller.<p>Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions.",1429573611

I&#x27;m not sure what ChuckMcM was trying to argue.  I don&#x27;t know of any big companies that care whether or not the toolchain/devices are open source.  They just want a way to get their design into the world.  What we (users of FPGAs) care about is price; the toolchains are sufficient (though yes, cruddy in various ways).<p>And to be honest, this conversation about the FPGA (and ASIC) toolchains being closed sources crops up again and again.  They&#x27;re closed source not because Altera/Xilinx/Microsemi need to keep secrets.  They already know eachother&#x27;s &quot;secrets&quot;, and the FPGAs themselves are rather trivial devices.  They&#x27;re closed source not because users want them to be; again they couldn&#x27;t care less.  They&#x27;re closed source because the userbase is absolutely tiny.  A small userbase means we will only ever see tools that are sufficient.  There is no benefit to Altera/Xilinx/Microsemi to put in extra time and effort open sourcing their work.  And honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t want them to.  I&#x27;d rather their time and resources go into continuing to drive the price down and features up (as does every other company).<p>Not that I don&#x27;t think opensource toolchains/devices wouldn&#x27;t be great.

You assume that black prisoners serving time for drug convictions are disproportionately punished.<p>In reality, as widely documented, drug busts are often the only way to get a violent person off the streets.  It&#x27;s not &quot;justice&quot; per se, since they&#x27;re sometimes punished for the lesser crime, but police typically know who the bad guys are in their neighborhood, who the likely murderer or rapist is, who&#x27;s breaking and entering, but it&#x27;s not all that easy to apprehend someone and get a conviction.  And if they don&#x27;t get a conviction, there&#x27;s the risk of double jeopardy -- can&#x27;t be prosecuted for the same thing twice.  So sometimes it&#x27;s more expedient to get them off the streets on a lesser charge such as possession.<p>If you explore the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (bjs.gov) you will discover some startling and depressing facts.  About half of the roughly 16,000 gun homicides per year are committed by black males 16-39, and most of their victims are also black.  What takes so many black males out of society can be explained by this type of statistic -- gang bangers fighting it out in the ghettos.  (Hispanics are also disproportionately represented, but not as highly as blacks.)  By contrast, the majority of white deaths from guns are suicides.<p>Indeed if it weren&#x27;t for this tragically high violence among Blacks, guns would hardly be considered a political hot potato issue in the U.S. because per capita violence would be about on par with Canada and Western Europe.<p>Then of course there are many other crimes of violence and property -- robberies, muggings, rapes, B&E, shoplifting, etc., that snare black youth in the legal system for years.<p>The U.S. has a socio-economic problem with the African-American population that has not alleviated, 50 years after the Civil Rights Act that emancipated Black people, gave them the power of the vote, moved the country toward greater protection of minority rights, and opened the legislative door to quotas and affirmative action to try to uplift the black population economically.<p>Obviously, there is still racism in modern day U.S. society, but it is almost more notable by its infrequence, e.g. the headlines that happen every time a white cop shoots a black suspect, a tiny fraction of overall shootings yet given disproportionate attention by society because of residual outrage at the casual profiling and brutality from an earlier era.<p>What can be done?  In my opinion, economic development would help to alleviate these problems more than almost any other solution that&#x27;s been tried.  I would focus on ghetto areas, both black and Hispanic, and designate them as &quot;special economic zones&quot; that would have greatly reduced taxation and regulation, similar to what&#x27;s been successfully done in China and other developing areas.  For example, an entrepreneur would be able to establish a factory in an SEZ with minimal EPA scrutiny and minimal paperwork, something that normally would take months or years, with all sorts of NIMBY lawsuits and red tape.<p>Get people working real jobs, get them on a path to middle class prosperity, and their children will see a way out of the hopelessness and despair that characterize the ghettos.",1429572742

9411375,comment,9407353,9411263,0,0,gecko,,,"So, let me cover three different things here: my attitude on Smalltalk the language; my thoughts on Seaside; and what would push you further into the Smalltalk camp. Last one first.<p>Smalltalk shines when you go native and really buy the idea that the Smalltalk IDE is going to be your one-stop shop for everything.  I personally find that this happens naturally when I&#x27;m doing really rapid prototyping. Nowadays, I&#x27;m a fairly passionate strong typing proponent in general, and I generally find myself happier languages like Rust, TypeScript, F#, and Kotlin than in languages like Python, Ruby, Io, or JavaScript.  But when I&#x27;m not entirely sure what I&#x27;m doing yet, when I&#x27;m exploring a space or trying to figure out how something ought to work, then I find that the power of Smalltalk&#x27;s introspection, and the flexibility afforded by the browser, debugger, rewriting tool, and metaobejct protocol (similar to but different from Common Lisp&#x27;s) more than make up for the loss of safety. So if you were going to play with it in order to get hooked, I&#x27;d suggest doing it in an area where you&#x27;re not quite sure what you&#x27;re doing yet. Maybe Cryptopals or something where you&#x27;re out of your element.<p>That all said, the strength of the tooling results in some odd patterns in Smalltalk that I am increasingly thinking are bad decisions. For example, there are no case or match statements. Instead, you&#x27;re expected to make all the objects that you would be switching on all implement some method (maybe e.g. #handle:), and then you unconditionally call that method and rely on the object&#x27;s differing behavior to cover the match statement. But that means that you&#x27;re suddenly unclear who all can actually be affected by a given line of code. The tooling helps, but it&#x27;s annoying.<p>The language also shows its age in some other ways. There&#x27;s not a real concept of immutability, for example, and the only real literals are numbers, strings, and arrays. (Pharo kind of skirts this issue by having an #asDictionary method on their runtime arrays that converts an association list to a hash table, but it&#x27;s quite ugly for nested structures.) The threading story is green threads only. With all variables being private and no macros, there&#x27;s a fair amount of boilerplate that shows up (although, like a modern Java IDE, Pharo&#x27;s IDE can write the setters and getters for you) (I&#x27;ll also confess to not being sure how the new slots system impacts this, so this may no longer be an issue.) In the real world, for production code, I don&#x27;t think these have to all be <i>issues</i>, but they keep Smalltalk from being my general go-to language.<p>That leaves your question about Seaside. I love prototyping in Seaside (see above) because it lets me basically ignore JavaScript and still code a fully stateful website, but I don&#x27;t personally actually like designing server-local stateful web services these days. I&#x27;d personally probably use Teapot (a Sinatra/Flask/Dropwizard-like REST server) and a straight single-page JavaScript app (or maybe Amber, if I wanted to use Smalltalk all the way down) instead. I think Seaside was an absolutely amazing idea when it came out, and I have a very high opinion of its quality, but I don&#x27;t honestly think it&#x27;s a great way to design services these days.",1429571236

Software written as part of scientific inquiry is frequently worthless and uninteresting after the questions being examined have been answered.",1429570879

Caught me out - I was trying to use an open source design someone else had created with Synplify, and it used a Grey-code state machine to cross between two clock domains. Xilinx&#x27;s synthesis tool replaced it with a one-hot state machine which was not safe for this purpose and worked for a while then randomly wedged itself. To be fair, the synthesis log did mention this in amongst the huge pile of other messages.",1429570878

This was already old technology, then - we had a Windows 95 machine at home - but I didn't care. It was <i>MY</i> computer and, with the help of a few yellowed books and the first two volumes of INPUT magazine, I could make it do what I wanted!<p>I think that this was a very powerful introduction to programming - a good few years of PEEKing and POKEing and dipping into assembly every now and again is perhaps the most natural way to develop intuitive ideas as to how computers work and, although BASIC is frowned upon, it's always good to find out <i>why</i> the hard way! A lot of these ideas sound scary now, but on a small machine a kid can really go wild with them, and that freedom can be the best learning tool of them all.<p>And another plus with this plan - the kid gets a cool new gizmo. ;)",1241355591

I'm an elementary teacher and currently teaching children about decimal places and place value. I try to use real world examples to teach maths whenever possible but I can't think of any using 3 decimal places that would be relevant to such young children (aged 8-9).<p>any ideas?",1241354907
590807,comment,586782,590579,0,0,weavejester,,,"No, but I'd rather have a fast ugly car than a slow pretty one.<p>I think I disagree with you on two points. I place a higher emphasis on efficiency than I do aesthetics; I want a language that allows me to do things quickly. I also have a slightly different idea of programming language beauty than you do. I like languages that have an small but expressive syntax and a concise core library. Clojure fits that definition better than any other Lisp I've found, so from my point of view, it's the most beautiful Lisp as well as the most practical.<p>But aesthetics are subjective, which is why I dislike arguments about them. I don't particularly care what language a library function is written in, just so long as it integrates elegantly with the language I'm working in. You might think that using external libraries is aesthetically displeasing, but that's a subjective opinion.<p>What I am interested in discussing are technical details about a language, as they are entirely objective. We can discuss whether a particular language produces more concise code than another, and come up with examples to prove it. I like those sorts of discussions, because even if I don't agree, I'll always come away with a better understanding of the favoured language of the other guy.<p>By contrast, arguments over aesthetics just seem pointless, as neither participant will learn anything or change their view.",1241353984
590806,comment,590615,590615,0,0,noss,,,"At that age I had started programming BASIC on my C64 a year earlier, copying the examples from a book targeted at adults and written in a language I did not know (english). [Only slightly bragging, but here is what i want to say:]<p>The teaching material does not have to be all that pedagogical, but the motivation make the computer do something needs to be there.<p>In this day and age, I think that the absolutely best environment is to make dynamic web pages.  By just outputting a few rows of text you can see a result page and imagine having it online for friends to use. One can also create dynamic pictures.<p>I used my knowledge of BASIC around that time to write training programs in multiplication, addition, and when English classes started, word translations. That is, I made semi-realistic solutions to problems I had, and the resulting program was used by me (and also friends once you could compete in score points).",1241353892

590804,comment,590539,590775,0,0,zhyder,,,"That would be an SR flop, which -like the JK one- is taught in academia but hardly (if ever) used in industry. I was referring to the edge-triggered D flop; it can also be built from gates but it should be a primitive element. If the object was to have the minimum number of primitive elements in the library, you'd need only a NAND or a NOR gate.",1241353348
590803,comment,590763,590763,0,0,alexkearns,,,"I couldn't disagree more with the central point of the article: that newbies should only ask for help from expert programmers as a last resort.<p>An expert may be able to solve an issue in seconds that a might stump a newbie for weeks. Moreover, a newbie will learn much quicker if given guidance from an expert than if left to their own devices.<p>I have been in both situations, learning from experts and sharing my expertise with newbies. I have always been happy to help out others and have certainly been shown the same helpfulness by people more expert than me.",1241353333

Like Logo, the kid can make things happen nearly immediately, but since ActionScript has a syntax that is similar to ""real"" languages in common use, the habits gained are more directly transferable to other projects later on.

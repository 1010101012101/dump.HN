If you are using Cloud Foundry, I&#x27;d still suggest the whole company stick with one language, one deployment infrastructure etc.<p>To be clear, if you&#x27;re google I&#x27;m not suggesting the entire company all be forced to use one language or something.  In that case your company is likely working on products that are different enough that it makes sense to do away with some global optimization.  Some judgment is obviously required.

I love this poem so much that even hearing it in a VW ad didn&#x27;t diminish it. It&#x27;s quite long, but the beginning is my favorite part:<p><pre><code>  To begin at the beginning:\n\n  It is Spring, moonless night in the small town, starless and bible-\n  black, the cobblestreets silent and the hunched, courters&#x27;-and- \n  rabbits&#x27; wood limping invisible down to the sloeblack, slow, black, \n  crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea. \n\n  The houses are blind as moles (though moles see fine to-night in the \n  snouting, velvet dingles) or blind as Captain Cat there in the muffled \n  middle by the pump and the town clock, the shops in mourning, the \n  Welfare Hall in widows&#x27; weeds. And all the people of the lulled and \n  dumbfound town are sleeping now.\n\n  Hush, the babies are sleeping, the farmers, the fishers, the tradesmen \n  and pensioners, cobbler, schoolteacher, postman and publican, the \n  undertaker and the fancy woman, drunkard, dressmaker, preacher, \\n  policeman, the webfoot cocklewomen and the tidy wives. Young girls lie \n  bedded soft or glide in their dreams, with rings and trousseaux, \n  bridesmaided by glow-worms down the aisles of the organplaying wood. \n\n  The boys are dreaming wicked or of the bucking ranches of the night and \n  the jollyrogered sea. And the anthracite statues of the horses sleep in  \n  the fields, and the cows in the byres, and the dogs in the wet-nosed \n  yards; and the cats nap in the slant corners or lope sly, streaking and \n  needling, on the one cloud of the roofs.\n\n  You can hear the dew falling, and the hushed town breathing.\n\n  Only your eyes are unclosed to see the black and folded town fast, and slow, asleep.\n\n  And you alone can hear the invisible starfall, the darkest-before- dawn \n  minutely dewgrazed stir of the black, dab-filled sea where the \n  Arethusa, the Curlew and the Skylark, Zanzibar, Rhiannon, the Rover, \n  the Cormorant, and the Star of Wales tilt and ride.\n\n  Listen. It is night moving in the streets, the processional salt slow \n  musical wind in Coronation Street and Cockle Row, it is the grass \n  growing on Llareggub Hill, dewfall, starfall, the sleep of birds in \n  Milk Wood.\n\n  Listen. It is night in the chill, squat chapel, hymning in bonnet and \n  brooch and bombazine black, butterfly choker and bootlace bow, coughing \n  like nannygoats, suckling mintoes, fortywinking hallelujah; night in \n  the four-ale, quiet as a domino; in Ocky Milkman&#x27;s lofts like a mouse \n  with gloves; in Dai Bread&#x27;s bakery flying like black flour. \n\n  It is to-night in Donkey Street, trotting silent, with seaweed on its \n  hooves, along the cockled cobbles, past curtained fernpot, text and \n  trinket, harmonium, holy dresser, watercolours done by hand, china dog \n  and rosy tin teacaddy. It is night neddying among the snuggeries of \n  babies.</code></pre>",1427766668

9293864,comment,9289612,9291419,0,0,pdonis,,,"<i>> You print 100, you owe 110 counting interest.</i><p>Um, no. I agree that printing money has bad side effects, but this is not one of them.<p>Here&#x27;s a better way of looking at it. You currently have a money supply of 1000. That money supply is matched up to 1000 units of goods and services. Assuming this situation has been stable for a while, there will be some set of equilibrium prices.<p>Now you print 100. The total money supply is now 1100. But the supply of goods and services has not changed. So the first order effect is to raise prices, since you have 1100 units of money but only 1000 units of goods and services, so the previous set of prices is no longer in equilibrium. (Plus, whoever got the 100 that you printed got to spend it first, so they got the advantage of the lower prices; in other words, printing money is a way of favoring some economic actors over others.)<p>But there is also a second-order effect--at least there is according to Keynesians. If you print money, that makes people <i>think</i> there are more goods and services--i.e., that the economy is growing. So they are more willing to take economic risks--hence growing the economy. So, according to Keynesians, if you print just the right amount of money, you can stimulate just enough growth to match up with the money you printed. In the above example, if we suppose that the 100 units of money printed stimulated just enough growth to increase the supply of goods and services to 1100 units, then 100 units was the right amount of money to print to keep prices stable.<p>Nowhere in any of this is there any &quot;interest&quot; on the additional money printed. That&#x27;s not the bad side effect. The bad side effect is that, in reality, the amount of money printed is never just the &quot;right&quot; amount to stimulate the matching amount of economic growth. It&#x27;s not even clear if printing money can be counted on to stimulate economic growth at all: the Fed has been printing money at a snappy pace for a number of years now, and they are still saying the economy is stagnant.<p>(It&#x27;s true that prices have not gone up very much, at least if you believe the CPI numbers; but that&#x27;s because banks aren&#x27;t lending the money that&#x27;s being printed--they&#x27;re hoarding it in their cash balances, because they don&#x27;t want to be caught short if there&#x27;s a downturn. So the actual money supply, the supply that affects the prices you and I pay for ordinary items, is considerably smaller than the total amount of money that&#x27;s been printed.)",1427765576

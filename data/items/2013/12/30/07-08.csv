Living in Monaco may be a way to dodge taxes on advertising income if they do endorsement deals, though.<p>Also things are more complicated for French citizens in particular, because Monaco and France have a tax treaty (dating to the 1960s) aimed at making it harder for French citizens and companies to use Monaco as a tax haven. Essentially Monaco agrees to tax French people/entities at the current French tax rates, rather than the usual Monaco rates, in a range of situations that fit the heuristic of using Monaco as an address of convenience (vs. bona-fide living / doing business there).",1388390081

Virtually all of plan9&#x27;s system services are exposed as filesystem servers (<a href""http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/man/4/INDEX.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/man/4/INDEX.html</a>). Some of these may astonish you - a windowing system, a FTP client, an SSH server, an authentication agent... Overall, the system is much simpler than PSDrive - PSDrive providers are full-fledged .NET objects, plan9 FS are just directory structure plus text files. Yet they achieve roughly the same thing. (Actually plan 9 does more, but I believe in principle PSDrive can be used to do these as well.)<p>Similar things (exposing system service as fs) is actually possible in Linux or BSD, with FUSE. You can actually wrap utilities and expose them as file servers, and there has been some limited success. But as long as upstream utilities are not adopting the FS as the <i>primary</i> API (which is unlikely), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really going to take off.",1388389638

Football stars may play for other teams, and celebrities may decline French endorsement deals. Corporations in France pay all of those people high salaries because of their value on the international labor market for their respective positions. By effectively reducing that rate, France forces those corporations to either increase salary significantly or lose  some future prospects. Football teams, large corporations, and brands may all decline to raise salaries, and thereby France may see a reduction in culture (brands, football) and FDI (loss of foreign interest in investment).",1388389589

I didn&#x27;t intend to conflate sparse files with file-based disk images, but I was trying to convey that there can be a difference between the logical data of a disk image and the physical data, and that deferred zeroing is the default and the expectation of developers and sysadmins. Images can be sparse and/or file-based, as the features are orthogonal, if cross-cutting.<p>More importantly, you clarify that RZAT is a necessary feature for what I&#x27;m mentioning to work properly. You&#x27;re right. They should both be ensuring the blocks served to customer VMs are zeroed on use <i>and</i> ensure that they are appropriately running TRIM commands to ensure maximum performance from their hardware. Not all SSDs perform RZAT, and it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad idea for the host to ensure the device is logically zeroed for the VM anyway.<p>DigitalOcean could easily switch to doing both, or at least guaranteeing the former by creating new logical disks for customers as every other vendor does. If, as they have blogged about in the past, they are directly mapping virtualized disks to the host&#x27;s LVM volumes, they are unnecessarily complicating their hosting set up and making their host configuration more brittle. With thin-provisioned/sparsely-allocated or with file-based virtual disk images, they can more flexibly deploy VMs with different disk sizes with minimal changes in host configuration.<p>Alternatively they could trivially ensure that even forensic tools would have a very difficult time erasing volumes by enabling dm-crypt on top of LVM, and resetting the key every time a virtual machine is deleted. This could reduce performance on some SSDs (particularly SandForce based models) but would allow minimal changes to their configuration to ensure deleted data is unrecoverable.",1388388597

File-based disk images don&#x27;t leak data when they&#x27;re deleted because the filesystems those images live on ensure that (non-privileged) users can&#x27;t get at data from deleted files.  Sparse images can be smaller than the data they contain because...well, they&#x27;re sparse images.  They&#x27;re files with holes in them, and the filesystem automagically turns those holes into zeroes on read.<p>Now, about Trim...  Trim is only an advisory command.  You tell the disk, &quot;I&#x27;m not using these LBAs anymore, so feel free to do whatever with them.&quot;  The disk has the option to completely ignore your Trim command, and even if it does mark those LBAs as unused in whatever LBA->NAND mapping table it uses internally, the disk can also continue returning the old data on reads of those LBAs if it wants to.  There <i>are</i> disks that make the guarantee that Trim&#x27;d LBAs will always read back zeroes until written again (an ATA feature called Read Zero After Trim), but I&#x27;m guessing DigitalOcean isn&#x27;t using SSDs that support RZAT since that&#x27;s generally only found on more expensive SSDs, like Intel&#x27;s DC S3700.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that Trim isn&#x27;t guaranteed to do what you think it does.  Unless the disk supports RZAT, the only way you can guarantee that the disk won&#x27;t return old data in response to a read command is to write zeroes over that block.<p>If you&#x27;re a VM provider and can&#x27;t count on Trim doing what you want it to (reading back zeroes on Trim&#x27;d LBAs) because your drives don&#x27;t support RZAT and you don&#x27;t want zero out partitions at creation or destruction time, the right thing to do is encrypt every partition with its own randomly generated key at creation, then destroy the key when the partition is destroyed.  Users will see random data soup on their shiny new block devices, which isn&#x27;t as nice as seeing a zeroed out block device but is still nicer than seeing some other user&#x27;s raw data.  (Also note that doing this doesn&#x27;t stop you from also issuing a Trim for a partition when destroying it so the SSD gains some breathing room.)",1388387176

5686514,comment,5682971,5684778,2,0,beat,,,"I don't roll my eyes at new tech, but I do roll my eyes at the idea that new tech can fundamentally solve problems, because the hard problems aren't language problems. I do, however, roll my eyes at using crufty old tech for new projects when better tech is available. I dayjob in the enterprise Java world, but I'm working on a startup at home. I'm still not quite settled on all my tools for the startup code, but I'm definitely settled on the 12 Factor App approach (<a href=""http://www.12factor.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.12factor.net</a>), and it's led me to the conclusion that mainstream enterprise middleware as expressed in J2EE is fundamentally wrong. Application servers are an inherently bad idea.<p>That said, my own coding is currently leaning toward Node.js for server stuff. I'm using Neo4j for data and it turns problems right on their ear - for my space (not all spaces), it's a million times better than relational and a thousand times better than document databases. So I'm looking for languages/frameworks that make my particular use of Neo4j more graceful. Started with Rails, but gave it up as the ActiveRecord ORM is kind of Neo4j-hostile in practice. I expect this is true of most ORM solutions (hence the R, for ""relational""), so maybe I can make it better in a lighter-weight system.<p>At any rate, there are no silver bullets, but plenty of wooden ones. I lump PHP in that category. If there's an existing PHP app, then by all means maintain it, but don't use it for new projects!",1368197967

I considered splitting into pieces, but I also wanted the first part to have some pretty specific results in it.<p>Re: specifics on what it's learning: The short answer is <i>no one knows</i>.  It's actually an active area of research, and while there are some methods for vision problems to visualize the sensitivity of feature detectors (they end up looking like faces, for example), it's harder to make sense of other types of data.<p>In general, an RNN is learning 2 things: 1) a function to transform the data at a static level (so, in this case, one day of trading) and 2) a function to transform that learned representation/state across time in a way that reflects the dynamics found in the data.<p>One of the reasons I built ersatz is because I wanted more rapid experiment results.  Now that I've got that, I'm just beginning to scratch the surface on what's possible.  Now that the machinery is in place, we're building out better tools for analyzing the data and what the predictions have to do with it. I share your general concerns re: all of that--which is why I've decided to stick to startups instead of day trading myself.  Think of this post as more of a toy example/demonstration, albeit a promising one.<p>Re: a forum--yeah, that's a good idea, we will do that.",1368197492

I thought he was just having trouble getting over an ex for some reason, because him being depressed didn't make sense.<p>The thing that finally convinced me, and ONLY in retrospect, was hearing the full story about him and our best girlfriend during that time. This girl is, pardon my objectification, an 11/10 in every way. Everyone we know is in love with her, and with good reason. It turns out, for a large portion of the time my friend was depressed, she tried really, really hard to date and/or have sex with him, and he repeatedly turned her down every time. He'd been attracted to, and probably in love with, her since I can remember and still is, making hearing that this went on for YEARS shocking to me. But both sides confirm: it happened.<p>It turns out, her wanting him made him feel like she was playing a joke. ""How could she possibly want to have sex with me, or like me in any way? Here's the answer: she doesn't. She's playing a joke on me, and I don't fucking care for it"" he says was his inner-monologue at the time.<p>We still look back and just marvel about that time, because it was so bizarrely different the reality we've lived in all the other days of our lives.",1368197432

I appreciate the criticism.<p>I'm aware of the huge gaps, and I've had low-priority goals to fill them in. The reason is because my blog is not intended to be a replacement for a standard education, but rather a place for me to explore and write about the stuff that I personally find cool. Usually this means I find an interesting application first, and figure out what background information I should present (admittedly tersely) to support it.<p>Algorithmic techniques are fine and dandy (I do talk about dynamic programming a few times when it invariably comes up in my applications posts), but more often than not I'm simply bored by the standard algorithms lessons and I believe there's a bigger lack of mathematics background in my audience than algorithmic background. Everyone likely knows (at least vaguely) what a hash table is and what it's for, but asking about a group is more likely to receive blank stares, despite the awesome applications to cryptography.<p>Though I may be wrong about my audience. I have no way of measuring that except to see what sorts of news sites it shows up on; so far no professional mathematicians have seemed to care except to say the equivalent of ""that's a cute hobby.""<p>That being said, I do intend to focus more on graph theory in the future. My own research is taking me more into random graphs, randomized algorithm analysis, and related topics.

Otherwise they'll be beaten by a new company that isn't tied down by self-induced paralysis. The government has no such incentive to do so. When faced with a choice between saving fifty billion dollars and having the <i>assurance</i> that everything is hunky-dory, the government will spend the fifty billion dollars without a second thought.<p>One of my duties, along with being a radio technician, is ordering replacement parts for the systems that we work on. Some of the stuff is expensive and reasonably so - for example, a circuit board with $200 bucks in components is $20,000 because it has to be professionally made and is basically a one-of-a-kind part. The supplier has to charge that just to recoup the costs of retooling. We accept this because we need very reliable parts on radar systems and are willing to pay for the assurance that these parts will be good.<p>On the other hand, I just ordered an audio cable through the FAA. Simple two-wire audio cable... $333.45. I could've bought the exact same thing from Radioshack for five bucks. Or Monoprice for one dollar.<p>At one point, Raytheon told us that we were not allowed to do any intermediate-level maintenance (anything involving fixing circuit cards) on their stuff. We were expected to send the bad cards to them, and they would give us  replacements and bill us for $10,000 each. The chief warrant officer laughed, said ""Fuuuck no,"" and told us that if we could easily fix it, do so.<p>Raytheon realized we weren't sending them any circuit cards and called the commanding general to get him relieved. He didn't get fired, but we started sending the cards to them for broken 2-cent resistors. For ten grand each. Same thing with $30,000 power supplies, etc.<p>Right now, the government has declared that getting office supplies from Staples is horrible. We're supposed to get them from Servmart, which sells them for five times the price... or more.

I describe my experiences with depression above, so I won't repeat them here, but I'm convinced that the only ""cure"" is finding a way to disrupt this feedback loop. Like others suggest sometimes it's drugs, sometimes it's traditional psychotherapy. Believe it or not there's been a lot of recent success with shock therapy treatments for various forms of deep depression - I'd assume because it disrupts this thought model.<p>""What I cannot create I do not understand."" \n-Feynman<p>Personally I think we won't fully understand depression and other ""thought model"" problems until we have an accurate general model of thought processes in the brain and the ability to manipulate them.

5686292,comment,5684773,5685915,13,0,Millennium,,,"The problem with what we call depression is not the depressive mode of thought, per se. The problem is that this mode of thought gets out of control.<p>The depressive mode of thought is a tool, and an important one. The brutal honesty of this way of thinking allows you to analyze situations more clearly, and in so doing, it allows you to make better decisions. Being able to enter this mode of thought was likely an important step in human evolution, and we all do it from time to time, even those of us who are not ""depressed"".<p>But like most tools, the depressive mode of thought can be dangerous. That same brutal honesty, applied to one's self, does not end well: our human imperfections basically guarantee that such analysis will tear at the psyche in ways that little else can.<p>It is said that we should not judge others because ""you weren't there; you don't know."" But that doesn't work when you apply it to yourself, because you were there; you do know. And so you analyze yourself, and your judgment inevitably comes out wanting. The next question is obvious: what should you do about that? Only there's usually not enough data to answer that question, so an obvious intermediate step emerges: more analysis. And so the spiral continues.<p>This makes the ability to leave the depressive mode of thought just as important, from an evolutionary and health standpoint, as the ability to enter it. Pick up the tool, use it as needed, and put it down again. What we call ""depression"" is essentially what happens when you can't put it down.<p>You can probably see where I'm going with this. I think we're going about treating depression the wrong way. We try to take the edge off the mode of thought, when we should really be targeting the mechanisms that let people go into and out of it. Those mechanisms, unfortunately, are poorly-understood today.<p>There's also very likely to be an extremely delicate balance: you have to let people out while also allowing them back in, lest some kind of ""antidepression"" take hold where they can no longer pick up the tool. I don't know what such a thing would be like; it's possible that we already know it, but under another name that might or might not be linked to what we currently call depression.",1368195447

With 10,000 people all following this same path, the author would ""only"" get $1600. Readership is likely to drop off exponentially after the initial publicity. Publishing two  articles of similar quality per month would get the author a nice living wage; not too bad, but only if they can reach an audience of 10,000 interested readers who are in on this compensation system. Slim chance.<p>Perhaps it works as a supplementary reward system. Another question: does this incentivize the right things? Will such metrics lead to longer articles which aren't necessarily interesting to read, but just take a long time? Does it disincentivize quality in any way?<p>More questions: how much would people be willing to contribute$10 per month? $30 per month? How is it distributedmanually or automatically, by time or by rating? Is the small bit better than nothing? Does this incentivize people to a) produce good content, or b) pay for its consumption? Would people voluntarily buy into this system, or does it need to be a restrictive thing where only contributors can read articles?<p>Just thinking.",1368194415

I don't think anyone that is pushing for meaningful change thinks the job is done.<p>Obama's win was hard fought.  Despite how electoral math works, I do not consider his victory a landslide.  The popular vote spread is around 6 points.  That is not a big margin.<p>I am from south Georgia.  I know black-white racism all too well.  Despite the fact that Georgia went to McCain, this was an historic win and I think it should be celebrated and the momentum should continue.",1225994385

Both skiing (and snowboarding, which tends to have a bad reputation among older folk, sometimes for good reason) are something that everyone should experience at some point in their life. Going 6 to 8 hours without seeing a computer screen, just you and the snow, is amazing. Those who haven't tried it - I strongly suggest you do! If you want fast results, try snowboarding. Snowboarding tends to be faster to learn initially, and harder to improve once you're good, while skiing is rather difficult at first but then is easier once you're past a certain point.<p>Disclaimer: These are, of course, just my opinions. I've been skiing for 10 or 11 years and snowboarding for 4 or 5 years.",1225993235

355903,comment,355627,355804,0,0,chmike,,,"Be careful with this method. I've heard a story of a German entrepreneur who built a valuable business around a web service and was bought. He wanted more money than the buyer could give so they agree that he would get a significant amount of the value as shares. There was much more share value than money because the seller was confident in the business model. Then the bubble 2000 exploded and the shares lost all their value. But wait, the worst is yet to come.<p>The next year the IRS claimed the taxes on the transaction and refused to take in account the loss of share value. SOo the seller had to borrow to pay the IRS and pays it back by working for the buyer !<p>The lesson I learned is to think twice in getting payed with shares or revenue promise.<p>Today the economy is really uncertain, so watch out for this kind of accident.<p>It also depends on the business and the expected long term stability of your business.

I have never in my life felt like exercise has made me feel that way.</i><p>The diet and exercise comment isn't like the Amazon suggestions of the type ""If you love being healthy you'll also enjoy good diet and regular exercise"", it's more about reminding you that, as far as weight is concerned, it's more or less simple accounting: deposits without caloric withdrawls = increased balance.<p>I understand that it's frustrating to hear this message all of the time (especially if you are unsuccessful at meeting your weight goals or don't like exercise), but nobody's implying that it's going to be fun, just that it's how the numbers work.<p>Furthermore, there's more benefit to exercise than burning excess calories, which is why credible dietitians and doctors don't just say to eat less: there are innumerable cardiovascular and muscular benefits; maybe not so important at 25, but definitely something that can make a difference between a youthful and a pre-elderly 50 year old.<p>Disclosure: I don't do any of this stuff.

That's ludicrous. All you've done is drive up the price of bread for everyone.<p>The other issue is the fact that the gourmet bread maker may actually only be in existence <i>because</i> shit bread is the commodity.

478478,comment,478360,478468,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""In what sense does mainstream science (whatever that means) reject Darwin's theory of natural selection?""<p>Darwin basically said that species compete for scarce resources, and the organisms that are the best at competing win. This is entirely wrong.<p>In reality, the organisms that are the best adapted for their niche win-- almost always because they are the best at cooperating, not competing. (With a few salient exceptions such as the deer locking horns on the discovery channel, which make for good TV.) This was Wallace's theory, which was rejected because Wallace was a social reformer who took shots at the aristocracy. Whereas Darwin was a well connected socialite, and his model was favored by the aristocracy because it provided a justification for oppressing the masses. When you embrace Darwin, you're not embracing science, you're embracing fascism.<p>Some quotes on this from Alfie Kohn's book No Contest:<p>Pter Kropotkin: ""Competition [...] is limited among animals to exception periods. [...] Better conditions are created by the elimination of competition by means of mutual aid and mutual support. [...] ""Don't Compete"" -- competition is always injurious to the species, and you have plenty of resources to avoid it!"" That is the tendency of nature, not always realized in full, but always present. That is the watchword which comes to us from the bush, the forest, the river, the ocean. ""Therefore combine -- practice mutual aid!"" That is what nature teaches us."" -- Mutual Aid, 1902<p>Marvin Bates: ""This competition, this 'struggle,' is a superficial thing, superimposed on an essential mutual dependence. The basic theme in nature is cooperation rather than competition -- a cooperation that has become so all-pervasive, so completely integrated, that it is difficult to untwine and follow out the separate strands.""<p>""Not only do animals seek to avoid competition, but their behavior is overwhelmingly characterized by its opposite -- cooperation.""<p>""If biologists have been saying this ever since Darwin, why does this seem so surprising to us? First, cooperation is ""not always easy to see, whereas competition can be readily observed."" Quite frankly, the bird sitting in the hippopotomus's back just doesn't make good television compared to two deer locking antlers or the bear catching the salmon as it tries to jump up the waterfall.""<p>""Second, the metaphor of ""survival of the fittest"" suggests a type of combat, since warfare and struggle is such a salient feature of the human species.""<p>John Taylor Gatto's new book, Weapons of Mass Instruction, talks extensively about this as well. Even this week's NYT give Wallace a nod:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/science/10essa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/science/10essa.html</a>",1234450791

But there were also guys selling insurance on those mortgages (in the form of CDOs).  Let's think about them for a minute.<p>Suppose you start a small company to sell earthquake insurance to people in California.  You make a lot of money, more and more as the years go by with no earthquake. When the earthquake comes, you can't pay the policy holders. Should the government bail you out? Is it just too bad for the policy holders? Or did you commit fraud?<p>I don't like regulation but fraudulent activity should be illegal.

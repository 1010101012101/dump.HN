2356128,comment,2354531,2355405,0,0,vilhelm_s,,,"But Bob Harper really makes two points, and Simon Marlow's article only covers one of them. The fist point is that parallel functional languages makes it possible to write correct parallel programs easily, by not exposing any nondeterminism to the programmer. The second point is that for such a language it's particularly easy to describe what the running time of the program will be, by talking about the depth and work of a computation.<p>Of course, the reason Marlow doesn't make that point is that it's not true for Haskell! In ML, the work involved in computing f(g(1)) is the work of computing g plus the work of computing f. But in Haskell that's not true, since if f doesn't use it's argument, g will never run.",1300823553

2356122,comment,2354531,2355089,0,0,kragen,,,"Quicksort takes O(N log N) time when comparing two keys is constant time.  But as N → ∞, if your keys continue to have a fixed number of bits, you're going to have a lot of duplicate keys. (Consider sorting four billion 8-bit bytes.)  In that case you can do better than Quicksort; you can simply partition the data in O(N) time among the unique keys, then sort the keys in O(1) time, then concatenate the partitions in O(N) time.<p>So if you have to have unique keys, each comparison is going to take O(log N) time instead of O(1) time, so the overall algorithm takes O(N log² N) time.  On the other hand, this is somewhat of a theoretical consideration if your keys are more than about 4–6 bytes long in the first place, since it's not very practical to store 2⁴⁸ records.  But 2⁴⁸ is a long way from ∞, and if you're going to fudge by treating the theoretical factor of log N as constant, you might as well claim that Quicksort is O(N) with a constant of, say, less than 100 comparisons per key.<p>I don't know anything about analyzing <i>parallel</i> quicksort, but maybe this key-comparison-time factor explains it? Because it seems like key comparisons would pretty much have to be serialized on Quicksort's critical path, no?",1300823476

This is the attitude I find fairly pervasive(especially on HN) and personally objectionable.<p>I understand that you find that belief ""objectionable"" and ""pervasive"". Have you considered the possibility that it might be correct?  Because you have failed to present any arguments against it.<p>There's a pretty strong empirical argument <i>for</i> it, just from the observed populations, but there are also theoretical reasons to believe it:<p>• People who only program at work, and on closed-source projects, only ever get feedback on their programming within the context of work, from the other people who work at the same company, probably on the same project.  Most projects and many companies are staffed entirely with bad programmers, so it's very likely that you'll never get a good programmer to look at your code that way, so you'll never get mentorship; you'll have to learn everything about programming by trial and error, which would take many lifetimes.  At many companies, it's even worse than that — there's no code review.<p>• People who practice a skill 80 hours a week improve much faster than people who only practice it 40 hours a week.  Many people don't even have the opportunity to program for anything <i>close</i> to 40 hours a week at work.<p>• People who practice something because they must, rather than because they love it, will never improve beyond the minimal level of competency demanded of them, because that takes further effort.<p>Now, there's a limit to how much you can productively practice a skill, and maybe you have a job where Rob Pike vets your checkins and that will suck up as much effort as you can manage to throw at it.

From what I remember of Blu-ray disc authoring, content has a tag for the firmware version it expects to see, but can be set to Require or Warn if it finds an older version present - 90% of the time Warn is more appropriate because while the disc author's firmware may be more recent the content doesn't necessarily depend on any features in that version.<p>I'm curious about whether these were all from the same studio or finishing house (a lot of video publishers outsource the disc authoring to a specialist company, if you are the sort of person who likes to sit through credits you'll see them come up at the very end). Chances are the publishers are not even aware of this problem, since it's not in their interest to make stuff unplayable if it doesn't have to be. Most producers are rather technophobic. I'm sort of curious about which titles were involved, but although I know some people in Hollywood it's unlikely that I'll be able to track down an answer about this.<p><i>Plug it into the network (because I learned that if I leave it plugged in the discs spend 30-45 minutes downloading crap over the network that I have no interest in watching)</i><p>It seems to me that your real complaint is that the extra features offered my most movie studios are not that great in terms of content.

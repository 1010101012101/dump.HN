It is a problem that needs a solution and your solution may have ended up being a multi million dollar idea which would have given you both great success.

AFAIK, there isn't a fantastic consumer-oriented (or even prosumer-oriented) solution in the market.<p>I'm actually surprised that Apple hasn't tried to address this problem, as an adjunct to its video editing software and its cloud service.

But the idea could make sense for a startup.<p>I imagine you could position this tool to videographers, sure, but also to the growing number of people trying to turn semi-pro at YouTube and other video sites.

It is now only backed by the 'idea' that someone will exchange their goods or services in the future for the paper you hold - or the full faith and credit of the USG if you prefer. The value of the USD is only in the prices placed on the goods. If someone refuses to trade an item with you for your USD then what value is the dollar? If you also read up on Triffin's Dilemma, you will understand why the US must run a perpetual trade deficit - to provide lubricating dollars for world trade.

Always dumb down your language. Not necessarily 2nd grade English, but definitely avoid words like ""multi-dimensional representation"" and concepts like ""binary or linear"". Most educated people know what you mean by this, but it adds an extra level of unnecessary complexity to your pitch. I shouldn't have to think about what you mean by ""binary taste systems"". When you give me a two-sentence description of your company, I should know <i>instantly</i> what you do.<p>2. Once you've simplified your language, work on describing <i>what you do</i> in as straightforward terms as possible. There was a good article on HN a couple days ago about applying to HN; in it they nailed how to describe something like Google:<p><i>Google is a website. A user comes to the website and sees and text box and a submit button. He types in words into the text box and clicks on the button. Google then shows him a list of websites that contain the words he just typed in.</i><p><a href=""http://www.acunote.com/blog/2012/10/y-combinator-application-insiders-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acunote.com/blog/2012/10/y-combinator-application...</a><p>Notice how it doesn't take for granted that the person knows what a ""search engine"" is. Obviously in this day and age, everyone knows what a search engine is. But they didn't 5-10 years ago. Today, everyone might not know what you mean by 
""a matrix that helps make predictions"" or a ""multi-dimensional representation of people's tastes"".<p>3. Now that you've described what you do in as simple terms as possible, tell me<p>a) why this is a problem and

I could imagine less scrupulous administrators on strict SLAs disabling this and letting it fail in a way that is silent to the end user to avoid downtime.

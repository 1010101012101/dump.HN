6553566,comment,6551374,6551374,1,0,Anechoic,,,"I get the message that Carey was trying to convey but I disagree strongly. I went to MIT in the 1990&#x27;s. One kid in our dorm killed himself. A group of friends and I had to convince another student to not kill herself. The problem has been so endemic that the Boston Glove wrote a series of articles about it. From what I can tell, similar &quot;elite&quot; universities have their own suicide problems.<p>A lot of this stems from the fact that these freshmen students are 15-18 year-old <i>kids</i> who are facing a really competitive atmosphere, mot to mention being away from home on an extended basis, for the first time. They attend with the hopes and wishes of family, friends and teachers back home and they are fully aware of the financial sacrifices that it took to get them to college. When they get that first &#x27;C&#x27; or even a &#x27;D&#x27; or &#x27;F&#x27; it&#x27;s very easy to look on yourself as a failure - and suicide looks like an easy way out for some.<p>These students <i>don&#x27;t</i> think they deserve to be there, where the opposite is true. That&#x27;s why these universities try to drill in the positive message. As WA wrote, the real world will make itself known in due time, laying a guilt trip on kids as soon as they arrive is not the way to go. At graduation, sure tell them to give back. But as incoming freshmen, the priority should be helping them succeed.",1381849101

All insurance plans got more expensive to maintain under the hood due to things like the 3:1 pricing restriction. As a result, some people whose plans &quot;met the minimum&quot; in terms of what they covered are losing coverage because their employers can&#x27;t afford it any more. Employers are dropping domestic partner coverage and forcing part-timers who would have been covered to drop their hours so they aren&#x27;t anymore - that stuff would even affect people who had plans that &quot;meet the minimum&quot; in terms of benefits.<p>> Waschura&#x27;s case would seem to be an outlier.<p>The 3:1 restriction makes healthcare plans significantly more expensive for pretty much anybody under 50. If you&#x27;re under 50, relatively healthy, and making enough that the subsidies don&#x27;t seriously kick in, you&#x27;re probably in the same boat as Waschura (though the specific numbers will vary). Which is a hell of a lot of people, not just a few &quot;outliers&quot;.",1381849028

The fact that they live in Palo Alto is the only thing that makes them eligible for the quality education that school district offers. For many of these (primarily low-income Latino) residents, a PA education is probably their best and only shot at breaking out of the cycle of poverty. And the landlord is going to end that so he can have $30MM instead of $15MM, and so that yet another developer can build yet another luxury apartment complex. Hey, it&#x27;s their right as property owners--but I hope they can sleep at night.<p>The broader problem is how, at least in California (and probably the whole USA), access to adequate education depends on a family&#x27;s ability to afford to live in a wealthy/expensive city. This is the real social injustice here--a quality K-12 education shouldn&#x27;t be a luxury that only the few can afford.",1381849020

6553506,comment,6551278,6552422,2,0,VLM,,,"As an intellectual exercise this is Exactly how your lathe was originally created, minus the zombie apocalypse.<p>Even if you abstract out segments (I&#x27;ll just buy screws from a screwmaker) that doesn&#x27;t mean the screwmaker doesn&#x27;t avoid doing the work.  Someone got to make the machine that made the screws.  Or the machine that made the machine that made the screws.<p>Eventually you start thinking about mining engineering problems which is also fun, in conventional definition and DF.<p>More importantly this is exactly how a design engineer thinks.  Exactly.  I want a IC fabrication thingy.  Well that would need X, Y, and Z, each of which need... and you quit designing small parts when mass production makes it impractical to make your own SHCS to assemble the parts.  And if the math shows you&#x27;re better off bolting a COTS subassembly on, you do it instead of making the parts, or you&#x27;re better off making your own leadscrew threads you do that.  But fundamentally for the first steps its the same.<p>The other thing is supply chains rarely fail completely but partially fail every day.  You may need to replace the ball bearing in the headstock of your lathe and the replacement may no longer be COTS.  Turn out bodging a different bearing might be a wise idea.  You just never know in advance if you&#x27;ll be rigging up your own babbit bearing or creating your own half-nut, so what not think about the whole thing.<p>As an OCD fixation it could get annoying, but for bored daydreams it beats watching Oprah reruns on TV.",1381848647

Some teachers are enthusiastic and willing to spend their own time to develop and implement these modern* ideas about learning, but in the end, one way or another, they have to conform to the traditional educational system. If it isn&#x27;t for management that presses for better test results, parents that want good grades, children that cannot take to the new way (for whatever reason) it is the seemingly incommensurability of these ideas with the traditional norm for education that leads to a watering down of the ideas and a feeling of hopelessness about it all.<p>What many don&#x27;t understand is the enormous difference between the learning of the one child (your child) and the education of a nation. Try institutionalizing these &quot;almost logical&quot; ideas about learning for nation-wide implementation for a reasonable price and see what happens. I think it is possible to implement these ideas, but that means that we as a nation have to make hard choices. At the moment, we choose to fund education for all and learning for all be damned.<p>*: Every couple of decades these ideas or similar ideas seem to be renvented by a new generation ...",1381848568

seen a good fraction of some of 
their best work, and it&#x27;s not 
too difficult.  E.g., to me, Ng
is out in la-la land.  Diaconis
is not too difficult but much,
much better than Ng.  Then some 
of the best
are Royden, Luenberger, and Chung,
but none of their books should be
regarded as needing some super
human effort -- they are all very
clear writers.<p>For Stanford &#x27;computer science&#x27;, 
mostly f&#x27;get about that; maybe
in 50 years it will have some
significant content.<p>The speech was insulting BS.<p>A lot of HS students work their
tails off trying to get into 
places such as Stanford; sad
situation.  E.g., they take AP
calculus.  Total bummer.  F&#x27;get
about AP calculus because the
people who wrote that material
didn&#x27;t understand calculus very
well.  Instead, just get a good
college calculus book and dig in,
that is, study the material and
examples and then work the exercises
until understand them and the 
material well.  Work from more than
one famous book.  There are highly
polished college calculus texts 
going back at least 50 years and
no shortages.  Working through
a good college calculus book is
not difficult and great fun.  All
the angst over AP calculus is just
make-work, junk-think, busy-work
sadism to hurt high school students
by trying to make difficult something that 
should be fun.<p>High schools and that Stanford 
admissions guy just like to beat up
on HS students.  Bummer.<p>Me?  I never took freshman calculus!
Instead, the college where I did my
freshman year was not very good and
forced me into a math course beneath
what I&#x27;d done in my relatively good
HS.  So, a girl in the class told
me when the tests were; I showed up
for those; and meanwhile I got a good
calculus book and dug in.  For my
sophomore year I went to a much
better college, started on their
relatively good sophomore calculus
(same text then used at Harvard),
did well, got &quot;Honors in Mathematics&quot;
and 800 on my Math GRE.  Yup,
never took freshman calculus.  Well,
HS students can do the same:  Just
get a good, standard, popular, 
recognized calculus book and dig in.
Then f&#x27;get about AP calculus and
either just skip calculus in college
or just show up for the tests and
move on to, say, linear algebra
(say, one of Noble, Nearing, Hoffman and Kunze, or
Strang, and, finally,
Halmos), theoretical advanced
calculus, applied advanced calculus,
ordinary differential equations,
elementary probability and statistics
(race through it and don&#x27;t take it
seriously since will see it all
again with much higher quality),
measure theory and functional
analysis, probability and stochastic
processes, mathematical statistics,
etc.  Pick a real problem, do some
research, get a Ph.D. in engineering,
then write software for a startup!",1381848318

Trust me, on CP/M and TRSDOS and all that on microcomputers we had perfectly good advanced multipass macro assemblers, even (K+R) C compilers, pascal, forth, basic, even some fortran and cobol implementations.  In the 60s there were people toggling in the RIM boot loader on their PDP-8 in machine language but not understanding any of it other than an exercise in manual dexterity, to use RIM to load BASIC to actually do stuff in BASIC.  For actual machine coders I think you have to go a step or two earlier... IBMs peculiar BCD mainframes in the transistor era and stuff like that.  Of course even they had autocoder and RPG for &quot;real&quot; work...<p>Secondly he calls them legions as a turn of phrase but even that is unlikely.  Tens of thousands sounds about an order of magnitude too high for the 70s and early 80s.  A thousand is probably about right and most of them were debugging assemblers and/or debugging debuggers and symbolic disassemblers and/or cracking copy protection, hand machine coding as an annoyance rather than by choice as the best tool for the job.<p>Finally to this very day you can find people perfectly content to toggle in PDP-8 machine language on a real front panel or 1802 or 8080 code in octal on a H-8 or look at and understand a hex dump about to be slipstreamed into a FPGA&#x27;s memory for a soft core processor.  And guess how many of us there are today... maybe ten thousand... The fact that the percentage has dropped because since then there were added 1M ruby programming CRUD app writing devs in the denominator of the percentage means very little WRT the quantity of the numerator of the percentage or even its growth rate.<p>And we know each other, and we talk with each other, and work on projects together.  Not on HN.  You want to talk about manual metal lathes and milling machines you go to the HSM BBS online not reddit.  You want to look at a repo of FPGA code you go to opencores.org not github.  You want to build a machine language front panel for a 1802 in late 2013 you google for lee harts 1802 membership card kit (I have one and it works quite well) not by searching at best buy.  The inability of outsiders to successfully very casually google a group does not in any way imply a problem inside a group.<p>&quot;becoming almost impossible to find anyone who is capable&quot;<p>This is an echo of the H1B argument / STEM crisis claiming we are in immanent danger because we can&#x27;t find any capable coders (willing to work for $7.25/hr or equivalent less on salary).  You want someone to write a BIOS or write an ethernet driver, we&#x27;re here.  Its not our problem that you can&#x27;t find anyone to work for $25K/yr, put up a reasonable offer and we&#x27;ll come out of the woodwork.  Some MBA&#x27;s inability to provide a reasonable salary hardly proves our non-existence.  It would be hilarious to settle religious arguments about the existence or non-existence of ... that way.  I find there is an extreme shortage of MBAs willing to work for $7.25/hr in the mail room, so we need to import a couple million to maintain economic dominance, otherwise we&#x27;ll run out of MBAs and have no one left to screw stuff up or whatever.<p>I would imagine for an english speaker its pretty hard to google for people speaking German.

This impedes comprehension, and invites mistakes.<p>I&#x27;ve also used this other GUI-driven code generation system, and that had serious issues too.  It has this hilarious graphical view of all the components, showing how they are connected to each other.  However, due to the limited size of the window, it will just stack all the components almost on top of each other.  If you started the laborious process to move them around to see what is going on, your layout would not be saved.<p>So, anyway, a modest proposal: Figure out how to display an existing programming language (maybe a simple one like Lua) with a graphical view.

Go without saying, but need to be said anyway:<p><pre><code>  - Real businesses have customers
  - It gets harder, not easier
  - Investors are normal people too
</code></pre>
2. Interesting observation:<p><pre><code>  - Being committed in the face of contrary evidence can sometimes be a game-maker. Generally though its just stupid.
  - Even very successful people frequently misunderstand their own success
  - There is no one thing that makes a company work.
</code></pre>
3. Sound important, but really aren&#x27;t:<p><pre><code>  - Everyone is basically scared of everyone else at first
  - Bring a notebook; dont take notes on your phone. People think you are tweeting or something.
  - People without life responsibility (kids, wife, etc) are at a serious advantage in the beginning stages
  - Every guy has thought about starting a dating site
</code></pre>
4. Insightful:<p><pre><code>  - If it seems hard but important and you try to outsource it, you&#x27;ll probably get screwed. Potentially for a long time.
  - The more stability the rest of your life has, the easier itll be to deal with the massive instability of a startup
  - Small problems between team members will become big problems given time
  - Stop dancing around the thing and say the thing (I love this one.)

If you <i>know</i> someone has a preexisting condition that is (statistically) going to cost more than the maximum premiums you can charge, then cost shifting of some sort <i>must</i> occur.<p>And it becomes a healthcare + insurance policy, the latter protecting against the true <i>risks</i>, like an unrelated auto accident or illness.  I.e. the now outlawed high deductible &quot;major medical&quot; plans that covered catastrophic costs but expected you to pay out of pocket for the rest.<p>Which of course is another reason healthcare has gotten so expensive and opaque, when a third party pays most everything.  Your eyes may go wide at the total 6 figure cost of a major procedure, but since you&#x27;re only paying a relatively small copay....",1381846091

The author must advise because there&#x27;s no certainty that if they just showed you what they knew you would arrive in the same place as they.<p>Mathematics does a lot of telling too, but the best books don&#x27;t need to as much. They just present things and let you fill in the missing details. It&#x27;s almost-but-not-quite the confidence of fiction, where a good author shows and doesn&#x27;t tell because the things they&#x27;re trying to share are just too large to be simply explained.<p>I&#x27;ve also found the best CS books don&#x27;t have to tell. I was recently reading the Reasoned Schemer and I immediately came to love the style they wrote it in. The author and the &quot;reader&quot; are just exploring something together at whatever rate makes sense. It&#x27;s one of the few CS books I&#x27;d want to read over again.",1381846048

Some things do not.  Many things lend themselves to a series of graphical representations.  The vast majority of things benefit from both graphical representations <i>and</i> textual elaborations.<p>One of the things I wish programming tools offered, was a way to &quot;zoom in&quot; details wise on a solution.  More than just offering an outline, I want there to be some sort of representation of how things went from conception to realization.  Consider, the story boards for movies/games.  Those story boards are lost in the final product.  Worse, when you are looking at a piece of code, you don&#x27;t really see the &quot;why&quot; of what it was made for.<p>Sure, you get some of this with descriptive names, but that really doesn&#x27;t help with what I&#x27;m wanting to say here.  An example, that I really want to explore some more is graphviz.  It can go from text to graphics.  This process is fairly static, though.  If it doesn&#x27;t turn out how you want it, you have to edit the text and fire it again.  I want something that can possibly go from text, to initial graphics where I manipulate it some more, to final representation all in a repeatable way.  (I think this is possible, but I am not familiar with the toolchain.)<p>More, there is no reason I shouldn&#x27;t be able to start from graphics, go to a textual details portion, at varying levels of detail, make edits, and view what effect they have in the viewer.<p>Imagine, something similar to developer tools in chrome/firefox, where in addition to being able to look over at the boxmodel for details, you can physically move elements around.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m a bit of a heretic.

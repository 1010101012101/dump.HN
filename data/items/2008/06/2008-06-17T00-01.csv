219267,comment,218845,218845,0,0,vlad,,,"I think that counts corporate developers, and corporations are not switching to Vista yet.  And anything you write for XP will port to Vista, so there is no reason to target Vista specifically.  To port to Vista, you may have to add a manifest file to your software and possibly rewrite some parts like installer scripts, rethink some of the flow of the program due to user prompts that might popup and scare the user, and update documentation to warn users.  But developers had the same problem of having to test in Windows XP separately from Windows 2000 and Windows 98 when XP came out.<p>Microsoft's own latest software remains compatible with Windows XP, and while Vista is one extra operating system you will have to test for, Virtual Machines let you run multiple operating systems on one computer.<p>That's not to say I miss my Vista system that I ditched for my mac. :)",1213663923

As such, going fully suited is the best policy, but feel free to customize it a bit.. a slightly informal tie, a quirky jacket, perhaps. You need to look like you've made an effort.<p>Once you're in and they get a good first impression, then lead with your personality. If you're an interesting person but you don't get the job because you're dressed too formally, you clearly didn't use your personality.. because while first impressions can be made by dress, the impression made ten minutes into an interview should have been driven 99% by the PERSONALITY of the interviewee.<p>Use the suit to get the first impression, use your personality for the rest.",1213663873

219259,comment,218828,218828,0,0,rms,,,"The rule I typically follow is to go one level of dress beyond whatever the typical dress for the company is. So if it is a startup where people would normally wear geeky black shirts with witty sayings on them, wear jeans and a polo shirt or a dress shirt, or even no-tie business casual at your discretion.<p>If the dress is normally no-tie business casual, wear business casual with a tie or a suit if that makes you feel comfortable. You definitely don't have to wear a suit for an engineering interview, you can wear a shirt and tie and no jacket.<p>So I would ask the HR person who scheduled your interview what people/the boss normally wear to work, then go one level higher in dressiness where one level higher is a fluid concept based on your personal comfort level.",1213663289

We make them all the time. But making a spelling mistake on a job application is the one place you shouldn’t be making a spelling mistake.

It wouldn’t make sense to share a resume with someone we’re considering if we haven’t hired them yet. Someone could lose their current job that way.

Perhaps a similar model of collective peer review could be applied to the work place. It might address some of the injustices that Joel mentioned, such as the strategic thinker whose insights weren't recognized by management, but valued by his peers.

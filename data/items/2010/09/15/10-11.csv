1693872,comment,1693734,1693734,0,0,baddspellar,,,"Effectively they're rewarding employees for interviewing with other companies. What about the equally-valuable employees who are very happy with their jobs and don't choose to interview? Won't they become a little less happy, once they know they're making less than the guy who was a little unhappy and chose to interview?<p>I've spent quite a bit of time as a manager at some larger tech companies. We'd monitor turnover and adjust our compensation policies, and other policies that affected satisfaction, across the board if there was an increasing trend in turnover. Sure, we'd make a diving catch every once in a while when we didn't keep a close enough eye on one of our top developer's satisfaction. In those cases we'd still look at our overall package.<p>When we made adjustments, the really good, happy engineers were even happier when they got nice raises without even asking for one. Now, by across the board, I don't mean that every engineer gets a good raise. That's because as a company gets larger, they get more and more mediocre engineers. The article doesn't say that Google gives big counter offers to every engineer. I assume Google is smart enough not to do that. It's not possible that all of their engineers are really good. Sometimes good-bye is good riddance.",1284548362

1693842,comment,1687974,1688253,0,0,powatom,,,"I agree absolutely with this. A bad hiring process is responsible for so many problems that companies have. Lots of places which 'require' <insert trendy language / framework> experience hire someone who ends up being in way over their head because they have no real programming ability, just 'knowledge'. Tons of people 'know' how to play a guitar, right? It doesn't mean they're any bloody good at it. Someone who can play a guitar WELL, can probably also play a bunch of instruments, and I'm willing to bet that they'll be able to pick them up fairly quickly too. So they can't play a keyboard right now - I'd put money on it that they'll pick it up pretty quickly if they have to.<p>The problem companies face is that the real traits of good developers are difficult to evaluate in the interview process. This is why tests (both generic programming tasks and a few 'real-world' problems) during the interview are important. Yes, I hate having to do them, but I recognise their importance. I'm very wary of an interview for a development position that doesn't involve a test at some point.<p>People hiring for development positions: languages (particularly the new trendy ones) aren't particularly important - a good developer will be able to learn enough in a short time to essentially hit the ground running. Hiring a bad developer who knows (or at least manages to convince you that they know) your favourite language / framework is going to cause you endless headaches.",1284547240

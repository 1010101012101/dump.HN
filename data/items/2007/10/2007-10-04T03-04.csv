More to the point, never act like you <i>own</i> another human being and are somehow <i>wronged</i> by someone making them an offer, the same would apply to a girlfriend.  <p>Fair game is exactly the right phrase, in business offering anyone <i>more</i> money or a better opportunity is <i>always</i> fair game, hell, that is the damn game.  Want to keep your talent, then make sure you give them a fair deal and don't begrudge them a better deal than you can offer should it come along.<p>It's unbelievably arrogant to continually refer to someone as <i>my hacker</i> in such a possessive manner, you may as well be saying <i>my ignorant slave</i>.  That hacker is likely much smarter than you are, give him some respect and stop talking about him like property.<p>No one is ever <i>stolen</i> in an adult relationship, only children think that, adults <i>leave</i>, there's a world of difference.",1191468353

But say you wanted to say something in a search result or your menu pane was missing something...would  it all be routed through that one small link at the top of the page? I guess I'm going for how can I integrate it to be part of the user experience.",1191467673

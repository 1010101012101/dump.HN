152679,comment,152428,152496,0,0,raganwald,,,"I used to make and sell software for classified ad management, including personals. There is a loose code of ethics for newspapers: they will post ""filler"" ads if there aren't enough paying customers, however they never pretend to contact a customer and they maintain custoemr privacy.<p>For example, one client had filler adverts in their personals section. There was a box number for snail mail replies, and their strict policy was that all replies to the fictitious ads were shredded unopened and unread.<p>Just an anecdote, no opinion on what is and is not legitimate business...",1207101392

152677,comment,152656,152656,0,0,fortes,,,"Practice as much as you can, in front of people whenever possible. All it takes is 3-4 smart people to come up with at least 80% of the questions you'll encounter. Know those, and you'll be way ahead of most speakers.<p>For the main talk, I found it also helps to write out a full transcript of my talk -- even though I usually don't follow it, it forces me to organize something coherently, and gives me something I can easily send to others for review.<p>Best of luck, and enjoy Italy!",1207101283

I started to write a comment saying in essence, ""So what if Paul is writing under a nom de plume, there are good reasons for doing so...""<p>One of the good examples that came immediately to mind was Richard Gabriel. So I Googled ""Worse Is Better"" and copied that exact paragraph to insert as a quotation to support my point.<p>Then I read what I had just pasted and the light went on...",1207100958

152671,comment,151637,151829,0,0,hooande,,,"I would love to get into a lengthy discussion about why the One True Editor is superior to vi, but I have a feeling that it would just degenerate into a flame war. vi does have an advantage in that it comes standard on most unix servers, while emacs requires a long (but relatively painless) install.<p>Let's just say that in terms of power the two are about equal. I think emacs has an edge in the macros/functions department but vi isn't far behind. It's probably also fair to say that either one of them are probably better than a Windows based IDE if you're working with open source software (ruby, php, perl etc).",1207100151

It is very difficult to get right and it is highly unlikely that those problems will be solved completely within the next 18 months.<p>They could double the transistor count now by running the algorithm on a better DSP or Cell processor.",1207099532

They can ""ask"" specific questions that you're already prepared to answer confidently (no one else in the audience knows who they are).  This keeps you in a better frame of mind to deal with the rest of the audience's tough questions.",1207098690

Practice answering asshole, condescending questions meant to trip you up. Practice off-the-wall/off-topic questions, just plain hard technical questions, etc etc. I did this with my research professor before my first talk and it really paid off -- I got a really condescending question and managed to deflect it and get some laughs too.<p>Basically, just practice :)",1207098628

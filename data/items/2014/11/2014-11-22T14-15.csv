8645631,comment,8644175,8644747,0,0,Bahamut,,,"To add some more details - being a good manager can be a delicate dance.  When you are a manager, you start to become responsible for high level tasks that have huge impact to a company.  However, if you micromanage too much, you create an awful culture of fear and hamper developer productivity.<p>So how do you inspire developers to execute in a timeframe dictated by others?  You have to be a leader who inspires the engineers to complete the task, even if it requires putting in extra hours.  This means setting the example, looking out for your engineers&#x27; welfare, being able to provide answers and not problems, and being someone who can be easily approached.<p>The moment something goes wrong, the burden is on the manager to make the right decision - the wrong decision can have negative ramifications over months, if not years.  The moment you micromanage, something is broken in your process, or with the people involved.<p>I recently had to start wearing a technical lead & director hat - the intense pressure of the startup world bore down on my whole team in order to get a working product in order from scratch in about 1 1/2 months of coding.  The resources became scarce since the technical lead got sick & had a family death, while two other senior engineers had babies in the time period.  It then was left to two junior developers and me to do the lion&#x27;s share of work until the other engineers could get back to work.  I let the junior engineers work mostly normal hours (until close to our deadline) - I ended up taking the burden largely on myself, with mostly 75 hour weeks (even after the other engineers were back as well).  During regular hours, I did some work, but was more focused on mentorship and any tasks that were blockers.  The early and late hours were when I busted out complex code.<p>At the engineering level, good management shows as incredibly important, especially for startups.  Pressure deadlines on engineers are taxing for all - good management by top level engineers is vital for preventing burnout in everyone else, which can make it easy for people to decide to leave a company, especially when compounded by salary that does not match what the free market has to offer.",1416667915

8645606,comment,8645188,8645188,0,0,DCKing,,,"The most intriguing part of FreeBSD (any BSD really) from an outsider&#x27;s perspective I find the fact that &quot;the FreeBSD project&quot; has a bigger, more directed scope than &quot;the Linux project&quot; or &quot;the GNU project&quot;. It&#x27;s a kernel and userland all in one, and they can actually <i>decide</i> to focus more on unity of configuration files and mobility. I get the impression that you cannot decide that as efficiently on Linux at all.<p>People often say &quot;Linux is all about choice&quot; as if it&#x27;s a good thing [1]. I think this overwhelming focus on choice really is what&#x27;s so frustrating about Linux and its community. If needs aren&#x27;t being catered to, or if there are disagreements, the amount of vitriol that gets thrown around is despicable. The systemd controversy is so terribly shameful, but lo and behold: FreeBSD now seems to be envious of it (or at least some of its aspects). Gnome 3 is widely regarded [2] as the best, well-integrated desktop environment Linux has ever had, and look at the amount of vitriol <i>that</i> got for having a direction and making choices for the user. I personally think that the level of integration systemd and Gnome 3 are attempting to pioneer make Linux far more attractive than ever, but the Linux community really alienates me with its attitude towards that. With this attitude, desktop Linux mostly remains a patched together collection of software. The rough edges of this patchwork are still far more apparent on even the best regarded distros when compared to OS X or Windows or even Android.<p>It&#x27;s a shame FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t maintain an integrated or official graphical interface. Since it uses the same not-so-well integrated desktops as Linux does, it unfortunately means that using FreeBSD is only a minor improvement over Linux for me in daily use [3]. That means I&#x27;ll just leave it to Apple to build me a well-working and well-integrated operating system. If an operating system project or vendor makes choices for me, I consider that a big advantage most of the time. If a project can actually take on a proper direction like this presentation suggests, that is a big selling point to me.<p>[1]: I know what the good things about choice are, I&#x27;m trying to make a point.<p>[2]: Widely regarded does not mean &quot;universally regarded&quot; or even &quot;regarded as such by the majority&quot;.<p>[3]: Ignoring the problem that FreeBSD doesn&#x27;t have the level of driver or application support that Linux has.",1416667424

(Being too rigid here makes the syntax very unfun for humans to write.)<p>Once parsed, element-style (first proxy node) or attribute-style (second proxy node) become identical nodes and are treated the same (but with a flag in case you want to write out a modified file): they are fully interchangeable, so no attribute vs element debates, just use what works best for readability. (This really is critical. Some document types would be ten times as long without attribute-style nodes.)<p>The syntax has no entities. <i>foo=&quot;data&quot;</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need quotes or newlines. <i>foo:</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need a newline. <i>foo\n:data\n:data</i> can capture any data that doesn&#x27;t need binary. <i>foo\n:base64\n:base64</i> can capture absolutely anything.<p>Node names must be [A-Za-z0-9-.]{1,}, and are case-sensitive. The same node name can appear multiple times at any level, even at the root level. Ambiguity is resolved by the order of appearance for each node.<p>The data values of nodes are completely unparsed by the markup. The syntax knows no difference between strings, integers, floats, booleans, binary data, arrays, etc. The application parses the text however it wants. The library adds some convenience functions (.text() to strip surrounding whitespace, .integer() to get a number, .boolean() to decode true/yes/on vs false/no/off, etc.)<p>File format is mandatory UTF-8 (no BOM.) Preferred line feeds are &#x27;\n&#x27;, but &#x27;\r\n&#x27; is also permitted because Microsoft.<p>The implementation in C is about 8KB. Since everything has a marker, allocations are not necessary for the node names/values (but you will need to allocate the tree structure, obviously.) There&#x27;s an accompanying path query syntax (ala XPath) that&#x27;s another 6KB of code or so.<p>(All the edge cases are well-defined (mismatched indentation, mixing multi-line and child nodes, etc), but the post is getting a bit long.)<p>This was the best I could do at minimalism. Removing any functionality it has results in ruling out many use cases.",1416666832

Or, if they are, they are for a symbolic lambda calculus program.<p>The problem with this kind of papers is that they are for a hypothetic programming language based on lambda calculus. In Ruby we have objects, instance variables and blocks. We have inheritance and modules. It&#x27;s hard to make a 1-1 mapping between the paper and the real language. This is why Matz said (if I remember correctly) that the algorithm would need to be adapted to an object oriented language like Ruby (so you can imagine, the paper doesn&#x27;t even deal with objects, probably just functions!).<p>Before developing Crystal we read some papers, but all of them were pretty limited (they only dealt with primitive types like int and float). We had to think of a new algorithm that adapted well to all of the language features. And the algorithm is very specific to the language, which is something good because we can make it optimal, instead of for a general language.<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe the algorithm in detail. We&#x27;ll eventually do so in blog posts.",1416666441

There already are <i>de facto</i> event engines for certain areas like device hotplugging (formerly HAL and now udev on Linux, devd on FreeBSD), whereas for a lot of other events in Linux software a typical way is to subscribe on an application&#x27;s D-Bus interface and wait for signals.<p>Indeed, OS X&#x27;s notify API looks precisely like a message queue from my brief observations.<p>But then there&#x27;s certain events and classes of events (such as &quot;network is up/network is down&quot;) that could have literally over a dozen meanings.

8645557,comment,8622003,8643408,0,0,wpietri,,,"I agree that it is reasonable for people to disagree with their company being characterized as misogynistic. However, I continue to believe that responding to reasonable accusations of sexism by spinning elaborate fantasies of revenge against a woman could reasonably be taken as further evidence of sexism. (I also believe that it&#x27;s deeply improper to try to keep journalists from journalism: the First Amendment includes press because they are a foundational part of a functioning democracy. But that&#x27;s mostly beside the point here.)<p>Do I believe that one can in good faith believe that current concerns about sexism are a witch hunt? (Note that &quot;hysteria&quot; is an unfortunate word choice here in that it was an imaginary disease used to smear women for centuries, and the name itself is rooted in the notion that having lady parts makes you crazy.) Sure, I guess. In the same sense that I think one can have a good-faith belief that anthropogenic climate change isn&#x27;t real. In both cases I think some are consciously acting in bad faith. But I think the bulk just don&#x27;t know enough about the topic to have a valid opinion, so they run with the one that&#x27;s politically and/or personally convenient for them to have.<p>As a guy, I get it: the shift from thousands of years of male domination to something more equitable feels like a loss. We quite literally didn&#x27;t have to think about how women would take things. Now suddenly our speech and actions are having consequences they didn&#x27;t used to have. It&#x27;s easy to feel that we get in trouble for saying &quot;normal&quot; things. But it didn&#x27;t work the other way: women always had to be conscious of how men would take what they said.<p>The system of beliefs and behaviors that punished women for speaking up and speaking out is on the wane, but as we see with Kathy Sierra, it&#x27;s still powerful. Until it&#x27;s destroyed, I think everybody has an obligation to help end it, or at least stay out of the way. And when people do things that look a lot like supporting and continuing that system (as Michael did here) they should not be surprised when people do not look charitably upon that.",1416665158

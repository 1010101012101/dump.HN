The costs of building rails and running a train are called fixed costs...cost per rider is inverse to the number of riders. That means that with higher ridership, cost per person decreases.<p>Don't believe me? The Calgary CTrain has costs not much different than TRAX. Operating costs, including depreciation, are $0.30 per rider...making the system profitable enough to subsidize the more suburban bus system. Why? Because they have 5x the ridership.<p>Don't be obtuse.",1359007166

So OF COURSE you would use a shell script wrapping sed etc. to implement these functions.<p>But guess what? To handle all of those options at the command line would still take a pretty large fraction of 173 lines of code, if you added in an equivalent level of parameter checking and option handling.<p>And if you want to make MY eyes bleed, hand me a file with ~150 lines of logic in shell script that spawns cryptic command lines. Despite not REALLY knowing JavaScript, I would much prefer to maintain the JavaScript than a shell script with the above commands.",1359007163
5107769,comment,5107264,5107264,62,0,robomartin,,,"Looking back at my work over the years, I can probably say that the ugliest and shittiest code has always made me the most money.  Why?  End-users couldn't care less what the code looks like.  If you are faced with an opportunity you write an ugly glued-together MVP, show it and get it working.  It was only after making money that the code got cleaned-up and polished.<p>The same is the case with ""temporary"" tools that you write here and there.  Ugly piles of smelly manure until you decide to clean them up.<p>Of course, as you gain experience you can write less ""smelly"" code from the very start, that's only to be expected.<p>I can also probably say with almost absolute certainty that projects where I took the approach of writing a ""Monument to Computer Science"" almost never made me any money.<p>I find that for some people programming can be very personal.  Criticism can really affect them.  Perhaps this is also something that you get past with experience.  And, while I always strive to write good, clean and efficient code, I, personally, realized a long time ago that the very first priority is to put food on the table and grow the business or support the growth of the company where you are employed.<p>People who get off on criticizing others for anything (not just their code but anything at all) are, regardless of their standing within their community, simply despicable.<p>A lot of these people are also cowards.  Not saying that these guys are.  I don't know them. But I'll bet they would not stand in front of a real crowd of people (you know, they kind that you can touch and see) with Heather in the same room and make those comments.  Why is it that some people might have restraint and manners in public but can turn into perfect assholes behind a keyboard?<p>This is one of those ""You can't un-ring a bell"" situations.<p>The other one I like is the equating of such acts to tearing open a pillow full of feathers atop a mountain.  To undo your actions you have to go to every corner of that mountain and gather all the feathers.  In other words, it's very easy to utter just a few nasty words and cause someone pain and even harm.  It is orders of magnitude harder to undo that.<p>In my opinion, an apology simply isn't enough.  I don't know what might constitute equitable reparations, but apologies in blogs are just too easy.  The author sleeps well at night while the victim still has to deal with the feathers spread all over the mountain that is the Internet.<p>N.B: It is important to note that Corey did reach out to Heather personally (see his post on this thread).  This, of course, makes him a gentlemen and I am sure Heather feels much better.  Nothing beats real one-on-one human contact.  Bravo.",1359007148

That skill set might have been worth atleast $120K to Palm. So Palm decides to hire him giving him a decent raise to join ( a good incentive to join). Lets say Palm gives him $120K. Now Apple which secretly knows that the engineer is worth a lot more to Apple will have to throw in more than  Palm, say they will have to offer 150K$ to draw him back. Palm might again counter offer and this kind of bidding might go on until the Engineer get his true value(In a way market is deciding the engineer's worth) - But what is happening here is that Steve Jobs is kind of colluding with Palm to ""fix the price"" of the Engineer without market deciding so! There by saving/making a boatload of cash (money saved is money earned)!\nSure, what I am saying is probably not the book definition of price fixing, but I would think that the motive/sentiment is very similar!",1359007096

I did play many of the classic games of the early 90s (original sim city, red baron, panzer general, doom, wing commander, x-wing/tie fighter), but ones from the 80s are kind of beyond my scope, even for an avid PC gamer like me. I could play them now, but not sure if I would be able to appreciate them on quite the same level with the same magic they had when they came out.<p>I do have one question though for the sake of curiousity. Did you ever lament or rage at the state of pc games in the 90s compared to those in the 80s? Your reply kind of hints at it, but was not sure what your actual point was for sure.

Most people from other languages hear that it is javascript and scoff without digging into the source or into libuv.  As a platform it made a certain set of trade offs which make it ideal for certain use cases, but some zealots see it as a panacea and suggest using node for everything under the sun.

Peppersprayers with chemical encoding to identify assailants uniquely.  Weapons that can only be used by one person.<p>The problem is these are NEW weapons and they do not in any way reduce the current supply of weapons.  The current supply of weaponry is deadly, cheap, easily available, and apparently, no law can be created to reduce or inhibit the current supply.  Under those circumstances, adoption of any new tech will be tiny and unimportant.<p>Gun violence is a political problem, not a technological one.

Unauthorized use is prosecuted, the clear expectation is that these may only be used in the same condition that a firearm could be used (keep in mind that these devices are usually not only firearms in the legal sense, but are also NFA-regulated due to caliber and/or barrel length).<p>I would go as far and say that they may only be used on students who are armed (but not necessarily with a firearm).  Now that might have the opposite effect is that they will be less likely to use them in a genuine scenario -- however, merely shattering the glass and grabbing one would alert other teachers (this would be another cost against teachers using them to break up a fight). So exact laws are tricky, but not improbable to device (much like there are regulations on when teachers may or may not physically restrain students).<p>Plus there's also a few other things: if you genuinely ever want to use a less than lethal weapon (or _any_ weapon) on a elementary child to break up a fight, some kind of psycho-metric testing should have stopped you from becoming a teacher in the first place :-)  On the other hand, in high school or middle school, a fight (or other non-deadly confrontation) can be broken up by, e.g., P.E. or wrestling coaches (they will be slower to engage, but this isn't a life and death situation).",1359006760

That seems such a small thing. ""Everything else they do...."" must be so important. I don't think it is. I think the most important thing is that when developing in the IDE I have a reasonable certainty that when it builds on the CI server that its going to do the same thing. The next most important thing is that our team can develop using the IDE each prefers (or vim if they want). Maven is the only ""project description"" that is understood by every IDE and also runs from the command line.<p>""Everything else they do with command line calls, just like Ant"".<p>Not so. For example, both eclipse and IntelliJ, when faced with a merge-war project, will set up a project definition that provides the same behavior as running maven, but without running maven. Modifying a resource in the common war project causes that file to be deployed to any running targets. Its instantaneous and automatic. Its the difference between an <i>Integrated Development Environment</i> and a text editor.<p>Everything else, don't use maven. Maven is a tool for building java.<p>Our tools for deployment make maven look like ""hello world"". I wouldn't use maven to deploy. Likewise for submitting code to anything. I use maven to build deployable targets from java and to upload them to a repo. End of story.<p>Basically, if it hurts when you do that, don't do that. I use bash on my build server. Somewhere in the middle, bash runs maven.<p>So how would I handle generating some code from another format? Depends what it is. One fellow said reading from a database for example. Well before I ran maven, I'd run the program that generated the java files, and then I'd check those files into source control so that we know what exactly got built. Then I'd run maven. If it was generating java from a text file, I'd probably have it as an Ant task in my IDE, and whatever got generated, I'd check that in too. Sometimes I've gone as far as to write an IDE plugin that builds the file automatically.<p>Checking in generated files? Isn't that an excuse? Well, no, not if you want to guarantee to be able to build it in 18 months time.

Further, the language doesn't have the cleanest history in terms of design, so in a project with multiple people on it, you are leveraging coding guidelines, linters, and the like to have any real consistency.<p>A colleague raised an interesting question which I will paraphrase -- given the desire to build a project that exposes webservices from the ground up, what language would you choose?<p>My first response was, it depends on the platform.  If you are using Azure, for instance, C# is the first class candidate, Node and other languages are tier 2/3.  EC2, sky is the limit. Heroku, probably start with Ruby.  If all things were equal, I would personally choose Python over Javascript.<p>Python and Twisted give a lot of the same benefits as Node in terms of async development.  Python is more consistent and has a more mature (and featureful) standard library.  Node and modules are plentiful, but a lot (even socket.io) still show some signs of being young.<p>For me, the choice is - right tool for the platform, group, and project you are working on.

You seem to imply that the cost is outrageous to expect people to pay, and I'd agree, yet the irony is that few things are as insanely subsidized as FrontRunner and TRAX (Utah's light rail system). TRAX has a per rider subsidy, if you factor in construction cost and maintenance, of 6-7 dollars. So if the people were actually paying full price for just ridding the light rail they'd be dishing out about 22 dollars for a two way trip. If they were smart they'd never have built light rail, but rather have taken that same money and quadrupled the whole bus system in Utah to actually give us a transit system that was actually responsive to the transit needs of our population. They would have moved more people, displaced more cars, and not have an absurdly 'tightly coupled' infrastructure where a single technological failure shuts down entire valley transit lines. But people see electrical trains, feel and see a smooth ride that can accelerate really fast and, to the best of their discernment isn't 'dirty'. And since they're protected from the real cost of the system they have illusions about it's capacity to cure traffic woes and save the planet. Never mind that when Utah was growing full tilt the number of new cars on it's roads replaced what TRAX's entire network managed to replace after  hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.<p>Here's another interesting fact. When I looked into Front Runner's costs (which relative to other faster trains is relatively inexpensive) and did the math to spread it over the population for whom it was moving their commute off the road and found that the costs equated to over 50,000 dollars per rider. That's to say that we could have bought everyone a nice hybrid and we would have done likely a better job for the environment, for less money, and not have had to extend a rather limited and fragile infrastructure.<p>Trains make no sense, not even in Japan nor Europe. Look at the actual numbers, whether it's the fiscal costs or the total environmental costs of the system and it's support systems compared to their equivalents in a trainless world.",1359005156

They would be strictly licensed and regulated by first responders, much like public defibrillators are.<p>While I found NRA's idea of arming teachers to be (let's be honest here, and I say this a strong second amendment supporter) absolutely nuts -- several people have circulated the idea of providing less than lethal weapons to teachers and administrators. I think most teachers (or most people in general) are not keen in owning a firearm, do not have the time to go through the training to use a firearm effectively in a high-stress scenario.<p>However (and this idea isn't original to me, I've seen it suggested elsewhere online) provide a modified than lethal weapon (e.g., a carbine length taser) in each classroom -- hidden behind glass door much like a fire extinguisher or a defibrillator would be. They would be given training in using this weapon to stop (or slow down) an opponent and there would be strict rules to ensure it cannot be used for any other purpose (e.g., it would have ""drive-stun"" capability removed and be limited to only a few rounds). Shattering the glass in any classroom would immediately set of alarms in all classrooms (giving other teachers time guide children to safety) and cause first responders to come (irrespective of time or day).<p>While mass shootings do not represent most of gun violence, they are especially unnerving. Generally, however:<p>1) Mass shootings are usually murder-suicide. Suicide here is either a primary (with murder being secondary) goal or a way of escaping retribution. If, on the other hand, the perpetrator knows they are more likely to be simply disabled and then arrested and thrown in prison, this creates further deterrence: it now makes more sense not to go through with the plan, to surrender right away before committing any violence.<p>Sentencing guidelines could reflect it: attempted school shooters who surrendered without firing a shot would receiving more lenient sentencing (but the case itself would be sealed, put on a gag order to prevent those seeking notoriety from making attempts), those are arrested by force would receive far stricter sentencing than those surrender voluntarily (idea being surrender voluntarily/commit no further crime crime < captured by force/commit no further crime < surrender voluntarily/commit further crimes < surrender by force/commit further crime).<p>Essentially the goal would be to sent two messages:<p>I) If you are suicidal, you're far more likely to fail, be captured, and have your life made much worse (on top of what ever is ailing you) if you try to ""take others with you""<p>II) It is very difficult to escape retribution in a mass shooting, so the best strategy would be to either not attempt a mass shooting or to peacefully surrender without firing a shot.<p>2) Contrary to popular belief, mass shootings are not always in explici ""gun free"" zones (Giffords shooting, Portland Mall shooting, possibly the Aurora shooting) -- and usually a single armed guard or a CCW license holder might be there but wasn't be able to do much.<p>However, several shootings have been ended early by multiple unarmed individuals tackling a disoriented perpetrator. Obviously it is not expected for elementary school teachers to be able to tackle an assailant, yet this approach has the advantage that now there are multiple individuals (teachers in different classrooms) armed with less than lethal (which by no means means ""non-lethal"") tools that significant amplify their own physical ability and can disorient the assailant even without directly hitting the assailant (i.e., one volunteer using the weapon now makes the assailant more susceptible to additional uses of the weapon).<p>3) The less than lethal weapon should be designed with the purpose of making an otherwise untrained individual (with no firearms experience) not only able to incapacitate an assailant, but to also make them feel confident that they are able to.<p>That is why I think a ""carbine/shotgun-length taser"" might be better approach here than a hand-held tool: it would be easier to aim, look like a more menacing weapon, and fit a wider variety of individuals.<p>4) (Added this later) Teachers, guards, other volunteers have a ""homeground advantage here"" vis. an intruder. This would be more effective than a passer-by CCW holder in a mall.<p>5) (Also added later) Less than lethal weapon have less chance of causing serious damage to bystanders or those using the weapons.",1359004776

This would be a strange problem for someone not involved in the firearms industry directly to tackle.<p>If you were to include suicide, which accounts for the majority of fatal gunshots, I submit that there doesn't appear to be much if any correlation between suicide rates and access to firearms internationally. I'd certainly try to keep a suicidal friend away from firearms, but it's just not that hard to find a quick and reliably way to end one's life. Suicide prevention probably shouldn't focus on methods of suicide.<p>If you're talking about reducing gun <i>crime</i>, I actually do have an idea. Right now, very few people who fail NICS background checks are prosecuted, yet many of them have committed a felony by lying on the background check form they're required to fill out when buying a gun from a dealer. If it's due to criminal history, the police should show up to deliver the news about the failure in person - and arrest the buyer.

Yes, ""replace"" is better English, but that would make ""replaceFile"" misleading  it's not the file that's being replaced at all, but regex matches within the file. To get clarity you'd need something like ""replaceMatchesInFile"", and that is quite a bit longer. Moreover, it's generic. When your program has a specific and unique technical concept, it's better to give that concept a specific and unique name and use that name consistently everywhere. (Best of all is when the name is lexically unique so you can grep it to obtain every single instance of the concept in your program. That property is so valuable that it deserves to have an essay written about it.) Generic English words are not always an advantage in code. As a program grows, they're likely to appear in more and more (unrelated) places, which makes them less and less valuable for conveying the program's key semantics.<p>""Replacize"" is one of a zillion ways to get the desired effect, but it does it well and with style, and I like it. More than that, it's the one thing in the script that gives it conceptual unity. If you highlight ""replacize"" in your browser and jump between the various occurrences, the structure of the program immediately leaps out.<p>This kind of terminological pidgin, unique to a given program, can be very helpful in making code clear without making it verbose. The trick is to make sure that each such term has exactly one well-defined meaning and that it's used consistently everywhere that it applies. Eric Evans has called this the ""ubiquitous language"" of a program. The current script is tiny, of course, but if I see a programmer taking that degree of care with their writing anywhere, it's a stroke in their favor.<p>The thing in there that makes my eyes water, if not bleed, is the unfortunate duplication between the async and sync versions of the logic. But that is hardly the script's fault. It would have to be rectified at the level of the language and/or platform; little can be done about it in a program like this. Error handling too.",1359004733

One thing that drives me nuts about these superficial looks at this is that the inversion would happen to us even if we shut down the refineries and stopped driving. In fact Utah air quality has been steadily improving even while our geography remains the same and our population rises and the number of cars on the road go up.<p>Stories like this are so easy to take out of context. We have the single largest pollution producing facility, the Bingham Mine/Smelting facilities. Yet when that's reported I don't see people mention that it produces the cleanest copper, environmentally speaking, of any other facility on the planet.<p>Happily we're not burning coal to keep our homes warm any more, but back when we did Utah's air was far dirtier.<p>I worked for a time as housekeeping in the Salt Lake Temple and the stories I heard were almost legendary of the kind of cleaning they'd have to do in there back when coal burning was THE way to heat homes in the winter.<p>But good reporting, in terms of getting readership up and people turning their heads, demands things get taken out of context.<p>And for those people big on Public Transit they need to know that it's all a placebo. It's not actually better for the environment. Just because you don't see smoke coming out of the actual car you're ridding in doesn't mean it's not being pumped out somewhere else down the line, and to add to that you need to realize all the pollution incidental to building and maintaining the infrastructure of whatever your chosen transit option is. Many also don't realize that in a place as sparsely populated as Utah (speaking here relative to actual big cities) public transit is even more illusory. Presently, for example, I'm here in Lima Peru. If there's ever a city that embraced public transit it's Lima. Yet for significant portions of the day a great many busses and combis and all types of public transit run relatively empty. Yes, commutes and weekends the economies of mass transit seem dead obvious, but don't fall for confirmation bias, if your public transit is available all day long then any benefits you get from packing busses or trains full at commute time has to be balanced out from the costs, fiscal and pollution and energy consumption wise, from the whole of the cycle. And if you bleed a lot of advantages in a city like Lima, Salt Lake doesn't have a prayer. I'd wager good money that public transit is lucky to break even with cars when it comes to pollution produced per transit cycle- if fiscal price is any indicator of impact on energy use and pollution production from any and all corners of the full life cycle of things.",1359004011

5107491,comment,5106767,5106767,87,0,mrb,,,"Heather, I agree that people are unnecessarily rude to you. Don't sob. Your code shows you are already a more capable programmer than most of the ones I interview. No one has given you a clear answer as to why your code is reinventing the wheel, so allow me to do it politely. I took every single example from your README, and show you below how everything can be reimplemented with sed -r (nice extended regex syntax, mostly like js regexs), and find/xargs:<p><pre><code>  replace 'var' 'let' *\n  sed -ri 's,var,let,g' *\n \n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r\n  find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\n \n  replace 'var' 'let' test/file1.js test/file2.js\n  sed -ri 's,var,let,g' test/file1.js test/file2.js\n \n  replace '(\w+)_(\w+)' '$1-$2' *\n  sed -ri 's,(\w+)_(\w+),\1-\2,g' *\n \n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --include=""*.js""\n  find . -type f -name '*.js' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\n \n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --exclude=""*.min.js,*.py""\n  find . -type f ! -name '*.min.js' ! -name '*.py' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -ri 's,var,let,g'\n \n  replace 'var' 'let' . -r --preview\n  find . -type f -exec sh -c ""echo == {}; sed -r 's,var,let,g' {}"" \;\n  (not sure if --preview does exactly that, I echo the filename followed by the modified content)\n</code></pre>\nThere is only one case that justifies reimplementing things: if your tool has the requirement of supporting the <i>exact</i> js regex syntax, then yes you did the right thing to reimplement this in js. I have run into similar situations myself. One time I had to support Perl regexs, and I started by simply using Python's standard regex module, thinking that it would work because both Perl and Python use PCRE. Well as it turned out the regexs I encountered used some advanced features (such as negative/postive look-behind/look-ahead, etc) that Python's regex module plainly did not suppport. So I ended up rewriting part of my implementation in Perl.<p>Edit: I spoke too fast. As a commenter pointed out, other legitimate cases for reimplementing this in js would be when you can't afford to or don't want to fork a process to run find/xargs/sed. It sounds like you were running the tool from the command line, so I didn't think that would be your situation.<p>Edit 2: Yes, the exercise of reinventing the wheel is also useful for learning... I am not going to argue that.<p>Edit 3: If you care about <i>simplicity</i>, I would personally rather write a small shell script wrapping find/xargs/sed and hiding their arcane options, as opposed to writing 173 lines of js.",1359003686

I'm in the middle of the long task of writing a clear, substantive criticism of them, but why they were bad choices is quite subtle, though it has large implications. That and Ruby has a culture of little or no documentation, even of the standard library, no attempt at consistency in APIs, even for something as basic as different kinds of network socket, and a community with rather more noise and rather less experience than makes me comfortable.",1359003658

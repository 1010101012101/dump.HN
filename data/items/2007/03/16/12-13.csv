Esber owed his fortune to the developers of third-party dBASE products who took his usability-deficient product and created applications that people could actually operate. This didn't stop him embarking on an RIAA-style litigation campaign. At a Software Publish Association conference, Esber declared to a group of dBASE developers ""Make my day!"" while threatening to sue anybody who dared build a dBASE-compatible product.""<p>( <a href=""http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=58"">http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=58</a> )<p>There was a time when there were dozens and dozens of companies who primarily added functionality to Ashton Tate's product, rather than competing with Ashton Tate.",1174049957

It reminded me of the Joel Spolsky article, or was it his interview on Venture Voice -- anyway, he talked about Quattro Pro coming out with a much cheaper price than Excel. Spolsky worried about what that would do to Excel. The business guy said not to worry; we just beat them.<p>If your competitor is paying for customers in this era of free, than I wonder if this scenario is the equivalent. I wonder how the Live dev team is feeling about this. Do they now know what it feels like to be on the Quattro Pro team before their product shrank to single-digit market share?",1174047179

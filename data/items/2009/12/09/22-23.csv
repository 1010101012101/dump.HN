But unless I totally misunderstand Schmidt's comments, Schmidt is not suggesting people should not make love to their wives, for example, but rather, that if you are going to do something that you don't want the government to know about you, you shouldn't give it to someone that is legally obligated to tell the government about it if they ask.<p>Regardless of how Google feels about privacy, it's unreasonable to expect them to martyr themselves for our sakes when the Department of Justice or the FBI knock on their door with a subpoena. The way to protect your privacy is to not tell people things you don't want them to know(or to use Tor or the like).<p>Edit: fixed a minor typo",1260399470

Everyone knows what it is like to say something, but mean something else. Everyone knows what it is like to have to clarify what you just said. People who speak publicly, as part of their job, make far fewer errors than us ""normal"" folk, but they still make errors. When they make a single error, it is perfectly acceptable to raise an eyebrow, but it is almost never acceptable to sound an alarm. Having seen Schmidt speak, both on video and in person, I have no doubt that he'd respond much better to a polite request for clarification than a misguided angry letter.<p>EDIT: And I don't even think he made that much of an error! The full quote was:<p>""I think judgment matters. If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.

It goes like this: the best solution to a complex problem is a simple one, and if the problem is so complex that I can't understand it in ten minutes, then it isn't worth my time.<p>So, for example, rather than taking the time to absorb the myriad complexities of climatology, and rather than reading the emails ourselves and analyzing their content and context, we instead take the ""simpler"" solution, the shortcut: we say, these emails are evidence of what I always believed all along, that the entire field of climatology is a hoax.<p>And really, that's a beautifully simplistic explanation for a very complicated field. Rather than needing to understand the field, it's much simpler to just say, this thing is a global conspiracy, and then move on to the next simple solution to a complex problem.<p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but the inconsistencies in claims and data that people love to point to are actually things that have explanations, that can be understood -- if someone takes the time and effort to do it.<p>It's really rather like the Monty Hall Problem.

Would that necessarily result in free public healthcare? It's a perfectly reasonable (yet unpopular view) to think that helping other people means doing the things that result in the greater, longer-term good, and that might mean make life miserable. Humanity that struggles is humanity that innovates, adapts, and evolves. Humanity that stagnates does not. There is a very good case to be made for inaction.<p>It's also quite ludicrous to think that, given the inclination to take some sort of direct action in my fellow man's affairs that _you_ get to define what the appropriate sort of action might be. Perhaps instead of a free doctor, I feel that a cash stipend might be best, where the recipient gets to choose how it is spent. Or, perhaps because I think poor people have poor spending habits, I choose to provide free shelter. To even start thinking along the lines that one solution would fit all problems is to engage in the most wide over-generalizations. And to think that you (or anybody else) gets to decide what this one solution would be and basically try to shame everybody else into accepting this one answer is a non-starter. Reasonable people are going to tell you to go jump in a lake.<p>Finally, it's completely disconnected to think that my actions have a direct result on other people's lives. People have a dignity and respect that is part of who they are, foibles and all. My writing a check doesn't make a person into a better one, doesn't necessarily improve their life, and might actually make their problems worse. People are who they are. Even when I'm committed to action, even when I've decided to take direct action, even when I think I know what the best action is, I take action because it is the right thing to do for <i>me</i>, not because I'm expecting some sort of miracle result from it.<p>Having said that, I think there is a strong moral case for some sort of catastrophic health insurance -- mainly because people cannot be allowed to forfeit their life savings because they had the misfortune to die from expensive diseases.

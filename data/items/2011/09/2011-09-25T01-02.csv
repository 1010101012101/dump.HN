After all, this mindset took root in the western hemisphere during the time of Reagan and Thatcher (read, 80's) and the Horatio Alger myth remains extremely attractive to the temporarily embarrassed millionaires which keep cutting themselves by voting the right - at least the non-progressive part (is there such a thing as a progressive right?) - into power.<p>[As an Asian, this myth is actually far stronger in this emerging, newly industrializing region.

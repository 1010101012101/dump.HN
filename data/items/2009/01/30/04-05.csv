457722,comment,456471,457650,0,0,matt1,,,"Very good observations.<p>- I'm not sure what the best way to show the price is. I played with having it big and bold on the registration page but couldn't get it to look right. In an effort to learn how to do it better, I've been taking photos of price tags at Walmart, the mall, etc and have got some good ideas in mind on how to make it better. There's definitely an art to it...<p>- The search does do substrings. No auto-acronyming (not sure what that is). No regex, as I don't think most people would use it.<p>- $14.99 vs $9.99... its tough. I figure I'll start higher and drop lower eventually if it seems necessary. It's easier to lower your price than to raise it.<p>- Inventory... most people haven't scanned past the first few pages. I'll need to find a way to make this easier.",1233291366

457700,comment,457499,457641,0,0,unalone,,,"I'm not one for over-the-top problem solving. I can when I want to, but my natural inclination is to only solve the problems that I feel really matter, and to leave the rest to other people. My primary aims are ending paradigms, I guess. I like shattering the way other people think, having people see things in new lights. I like the same reaction in me. And that's something that art and art alone can do. I'm not mystical about it: I just care about that idea of the artistic statement, sort of a declaration of intent. So that's what I focus on.<p>Beyond that, however, Finnegans Wake is just the most incredible piece of art I've ever seen. If you like solving puzzles, <i>that's</i> a book for you. It's the hardest book on the planet, and it's beautiful. A single sentence in that book blows away most literature I've read, period. Understanding it in its entirety is near-impossible. That's why I'd take that over the billion dollars.<p>(Mind you, I'd take a billion dollars over most other things. I like earning money a lot.)",1233290075

I see the value of going to law school to get a law degree and help in passing the bar, but I don't see the value in taking English if you plan to get a career out of it... unless perhaps you desire to teach English.<p>I mean I'm working to become a novelist, and the best advice I ever saw was to find something that interests you and then write about it. I mean all my favorite writers come from such bizarre fields like a ESA scientists, Cops, Soldiers, Forensic Investigators, Physicists, Economists, Mathematicians, etc. Not a single one (that I'm aware of) even touched English, yet all are full time writers.<p>I mean a perfect example of this is Cory Doctorow. He dropped out of four universities, became an electronics right activist and worked for the EFF before quitting and becoming a full-time writer. No degree in english, no creative writing in university.<p>IMO I see this happening in IT. The classic path to money was joining the economic elite, however 2/3 of the biggest names in IT never graduated university.

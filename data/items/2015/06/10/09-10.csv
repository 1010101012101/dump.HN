A good exercise in understanding the complexity is writing a simple syntax highlighting code viewer with native controls (not HTML) and see how much memory/CPU cycles your implementation uses for a 2MB file.<p>Tons of optimization needs to happen - for example, as far as I know very little information about lines that aren&#x27;t visible is kept in memory in Visual Studio - so called &quot;virtual lines.&quot; I&#x27;m sure other more mature code editors have this type of optimization as well. From a native perspective this type of optimization isn&#x27;t a complete nightmare to implement (although it&#x27;s hard if you consider code folding), however, imagine trying to do it in HTML. The browser is still going too do all the reflow etc. for the lines that aren&#x27;t even visible, eating up CPU cycles and memory.<p>Even merely syntax highlighting is a problem.

I do not think, that you buy status symbols to move to an upper class, I think they are uniforms to identify yourself within your own class and move to the top of it.<p>Excessive manicure, hair extensions etc. are expensive but seem like a stupid investment. They (in my mind, subjectively) lower your social status, because they are uniforms of the lower class.<p>Moving one class up, a big car is expensive, but you still will not be accepted in the (upper) middle class if you do not have a proper job or you wear a uniform of the lower class. The question arises whether your house is paid of or not and why you bought that car if it is not<p>The farther up you rise in the Bildungsbürgertum [0], the more subtle the indicators get: Do you use foreign words, that indicate your French/Latin language education? Which instruments do your children play? Do your children play football (soccer) or tennis?<p>The point of these status indicators is, that you can not fake them easily. You can not pay of your house if you do not have a proper paying job. You have to get a certain education to show of certain skills. If you have these things you already belong to the respective class.<p>Edit: Wanted to add one more thing: My most favourite social status indicator is the number of children. It seems to me, that having more than 3 children is an indicator of either the lower class, because the marginal costs of an additional child are mostly paid by the state, or the upper class, because you they can handle the marginal costs on their own again. The middle class often does not want to pay these costs.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsb%C3%BCrgertum"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsb%C3%BCrgertum</a>",1433927864

You can&#x27;t glean anything much of value from a face-to-face interview with a software developer; at least, it can range from the fact they either can&#x27;t answer questions, or they can answer them perfectly with all the right idioms and (language)-speak. Doesn&#x27;t really help to determine whether they&#x27;d be a valuable asset I don&#x27;t think (well, the former you can dismiss, but the latter you can&#x27;t rely on solely). Of course, there&#x27;s a lot more you&#x27;ll get from the interview related to interpersonal skills etc.<p>I think a coding test is vital... that&#x27;s the first step in filtering out the ones that can talk the talk versus people that can write nice code. I had to conduct interviews for a team in another country at one stage, and I had (supposed) PhD students that couldn&#x27;t write a Hello World in the language of choice. Had they have been selected just on their resumes, they would&#x27;ve got in easily.<p>Then beyond that, there are fast learners that can pick up anything given a bit of time and become the leaders in the group, then there are people that can&#x27;t. Interviews I don&#x27;t think will find the former.<p>Then at times these people will get thrown together on teams and you wonder why there&#x27;s friction... because you&#x27;ve hired some people that aren&#x27;t helpful, and the others in the team know they&#x27;ll have to carry them. For expensive jobs, I think its worth taking the time to do a few rounds, provide some good coding challenges, and not to be <i>too</i> pedantic about things if you think the candidate has the experience to pick things up despite not having learnt the latest * framework (of which we seem to get new ones every day).",1433927391

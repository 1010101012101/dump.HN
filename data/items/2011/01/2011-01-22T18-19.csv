I got B and C on physics, so nothing for that. 
I don't learn every little fact, I usually learn what I think is most likely to be on the exam and focus on it.
I go through the process of figuring out the key material by paying attention to teacher when it is announced what will be on the exam. During the class, the teacher would spend more time on certain concepts than others because they are likely to be the key concepts.<p>I tend to go over the course's lecture notes and write a condensed version for myself. I tend to write in my own words because then I can better understand it. When you have to summarize the content well, you have to be able to understand it. If you try to half-ass it, you will pay for it later, so I am assuming that you are willing to spend the time to study and do it right. Once you understand the concept, then it comes down to memorization. If you have the time, doing some application would help. That is why there are physics lab. For CS, we have our computers to write out the needleman-wunsch algorithm and try it out, if hand-simulation is not enough to learn the concept.
For math, you will need to solve the equations, right the proof, draw the graph and trace out the algorithm.
For english, you would go through examples in the book.<p>The best situation is when the teacher provides a sample exam, which has same problems as the final exam, but the variables are different. Then you would just try to re-do sample exam.<p>I also like to go over the homeworks and make sure I understnad why I was made to do them and what I learned from them.",1295721143

Here's the process I used to get that mms URL:<p>Using Opera, follow the link from the Franz site to the GotoMeeting site.  Then, set Opera to ""Mask as Internet Explorer"" in the ""Edit Site Preferences"" dialog that you can access by right-clicking on the background of the site you want to edit preferences for.  After that, you may need to reload the GotoMeeting site (or maybe even clear your cookies and reload).<p>The above procedure should hopefully keep GotoMeeting from noticing that you're not using Internet Explorer.  The same procedure can be used on other sites that complain about your using an ""incompatible"" browser.<p>Anyway, next you should be able to fill out the registration form and then you should see a button called ""View Recorded Webinar"".  When you click that button in Opera, you should be prompted to save a certain long-named "".asx"" file.  Save it as any name you like.  Let's say you saved it as ""foo.asx"".<p>Then you should be able to play that file directly in mplayer by typing:<p><pre><code>  mplayer -playlist foo.asx
</code></pre>
Or, if you look inside that file (using cat or less) you should see the mms URL that I mentioned above.<p>That's it!<p>If any content providers happen to be reading this, please make your videos directly and simply downloadable as .mp4 or .avi or .wmv or .ogv videos, instead of making users jump through ridiculous hoops like this when they can't or don't want to use your streaming technology.",1295719450

You seem to prefer ignoring the data we have, with the post-hoc justification that it isn't perfect in every way. Do you do this when the data supports your preconceived notions as well?<p>As for the ""cognitive dissonance"", your definition of hardworking is circular:<p>Hardworking: (adj) <i>industrious</i>, tireless, untiring (characterized by hard work and perseverance)<p>Industrious: (adj) <i>hardworking</i>, industrious, tireless, untiring (characterized by hard work and perseverance)<p>In a fact based discussion, one usually needs to construct a more precise definition of colloquial terms. There is no effective procedure for determining whether individual X is hardworking by the dictionary definition, and thus we cannot count the number of hardworking people. I constructed a definition which a) is measurable and b) which roughly agrees with my intuitive notion of what ""hardworking"" means. If you don't like it, replace ""hardworking"" with ""Category H"" in my previous post.<p>Sorry if my attempts at precision and use of facts interfere with your desire to confuse things and revert back to your preconceived notions.",1295719355

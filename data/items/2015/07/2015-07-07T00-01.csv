9843053,comment,9838196,9840872,0,0,amatsukawa,,,"2 cents from someone who took CS61A in scheme and had a hand in creating the new python version of the course and subsequently was a TA for the class for a few semesters on this debate:<p>In any class of reasonable difficulty/usefulness, there will be students who do great, ones that do okay, and ones that struggle. What we should aim to do as the very first intro course is to help as many of those people from all of those groups to do as well as possible in their future classes/careers.<p>For the great students, I actually believe we did them a disservice. CS61A in scheme was truly beautiful. It was amazing, given how simple the language was, how much you could achieve. All pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. Trying to do the course in python, on the other hand, we had to compromise a little bit. We didn&#x27;t want to just teach the exact same content in a different language. We wanted to teach the &quot;Pythononic&quot; way of doing things. To give a few examples:
- The first 1/3 of CS61A in scheme had no mutation. That is almost impossible in Python to do, and is not the way the language is used in industry. I personally believe functional programming and immutability is The-Way to program, so I see this as a huge loss.
- We teach recursive lists (linked lists) in order to teach recursion, but I feel like having both the default Python mutable lists (which are array lists) and linked lists is confusing to students, since we do not teach their performance tradeoffs (that is in 61B). 
- Mutual recursion was almost useless to teach. Where it was most commonly used in Scheme, you achieve the similar thing using list comprehensions in Python (the language feature essentially took away your need to construct the list in a recursive fashion). 
- The very interesting bits of the old class about metacircular evaluators, we simply could not do in Python.
- Python also has tons of quirks (magic methods, for instance) and lost some of the elegance we saw in scheme.<p>But for the okay and struggling students - 70-80 percentile and below, the students who understand <i>most</i> of the material, but perhaps fail to grasp some of the more complex concepts - I think Python was the correct way to go for a few reasons:
- It is a much more commonly used language. It sets you up to go for internships, research, hackathons, whatever you please, straight from what you learned in class.
- The language is way more similar to Java, which allows students to translate what they learned easier to the next course in the series, CS61B.
- 80% of the material hasn&#x27;t changed but you&#x27;ve gained the above benefits. Remember, we are talking about students who probably would have struggled to grasp those last 20% anyway (maybe they are completely new to programming and they already have their hands full with the 80% to begin with).<p>I think therein lies the difference in opinion. If you took CS61A in scheme and understood it very well, then you don&#x27;t understand the change. If you understood the intricacies of what was taught in CS61A, you will find it very easy to generalize those concepts to new languages - and new concepts. In fact, you will find that much of what you learn in the rest of your undergrad career will be &quot;CS61A review&quot;. However, for students who may not have had the CS maturity or time to grasp all the concepts, they find that the Python course is much more useful.",1436230670

I don&#x27;t think we can say whether this character is Han, Zhuang, Hui, or necessarily any specific race that happens to exist primarily within the borders of what we call the nation of China.<p>Seems to me that character is more making fun of the culture of a nation than of a single ethnic group (or even some set of ethnic groups). If they had a character that made fun of, say, British culture, would that be OK with you? Or only if the character was white? (Which would seem awfully racist to me.)<p>Or is it only safe to satirize culture if the subject of the satire has ethnic roots in the Caucuses?<p>Or is it not about ethnicity, but appearance? Is it enough if they merely appear white? Because that opens the comedic landscape far beyond the Caucasus. Can we satirize Mexican culture, provided we limit it to Mexicans of European descent? (Again, how racist is that?)<p>There are some real battles worth fighting, but this really seems like a cosmetic one to me, no matter how much you think it &quot;smells like racism.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s like some people have a sense of indignation that&#x27;s only tuned to detect a few things, and throw any sense of nuance or concept of false-positives out the window.",1436230380

You become worth $40 billion by ripping off the people who work for you.</i><p>This is obviously false -- the sheer number of startups and companies that die by ripping off (and hence pissing off) their employees and customers is staggering. In the case of Uber, the main source of complaints is not the drivers or customers... it&#x27;s Uber&#x27;s competition, such as the Taxi coops this article describes in glowing terms. (#include the french riots)<p>The only driver complaints I&#x27;m aware of basically stem from the interest misalignment caused by Uber&#x27;s taking a 20% commission from drivers rather than X% after estimated driver expenses. This led to the recent price cuts looking a whole lot better to Uber (who directly profited from the increased usage) than it did to the drivers (who now have a much lower profit-per-faire)... but given that driver income is still effectively 2x the minimum wage I still have a hard time considering this &quot;evil&quot; in any traditional sense.<p><i>> The efficiency gains of connecting workers to customers via the internet applications will drive down prices and thus incomes, while the new profits created will all get sucked up by the small group of Silicon Valley companies that created the platforms, along with their shareholders.</i><p>AND consumers (who collectively are profiting the most here). For example, eBay did make the founders wealthy, but it&#x27;s ludicrous to claim they somehow sucked all the wealth away from everyone else. Business isn&#x27;t zero sum, and easy access to cheap used electronics (or access to ubiquitous high quality low cost rides) is being ignored in this analysis.<p>Okay, I think that&#x27;s all I can take.

9843000,comment,9842784,9842784,0,0,rayiner,,,"> Another complaint is more subtle, but more frightening: that these technologies are exacerbating inequality and driving us towards a &quot;servant&quot; economy, where large pools of poorly paid and economically insecure workers will spend their lives providing all manner of petty services for the well-heeled elite.<p>This is my biggest fear. When my family lived in Bangladesh, we had a cook, maids, and a full time nanny for me even though my mom didn&#x27;t work. My dad once sent the nanny out with some money to buy a pack of cigarettes, and he came home empty handed because he couldn&#x27;t bear to pay a whole day&#x27;s wage for a pack of cigarettes (my dad went through two packs a day at the time). The value of human labor is just incredibly low over there (or at least was 25 years ago).<p>That kind of society is a travesty. You don&#x27;t want that here. Maybe it won&#x27;t come to pass. I hope it doesn&#x27;t. But matter how gung-ho you are about the sharing economy or how much faith you have in the market, you should at least fear that potential outcome.",1436229932

Why would you charge customers who <i>need money</i> as opposed to those who want to <i>invest</i>? Pbobaly because all your customers are of the first type.",1197225693

87494,comment,87392,87392,0,0,jawngee,,,"It's all about smoking the right blend at the right amount.  Varying strains have different properties when imbued, so you have to choose carefully and not go overboard.  You need to know what your smoking, the amounts by which to smoke it, etc.<p>I'd say that 90% of my staff smokes on the regular.  I find the cognitive dissonance helps me abstract problems out much more quickly, as well as increases concentration and thoroughness when tackling an issue.  I understand this is the opposite response one would naturally assume to occur, but it really is about what you are smoking and how much.  If you smoke so much that you suffer from a round of derealization, then it's going to dampen your output.  Also, it's about how regularly you smoke as well.  The more you do it, the more skill you have in dealing with the high itself.  If you don't smoke weed regularly, social or otherwise, the less capable you will be of being functional on it.<p>Naturally, it's not something I'd recommend doing every day, but it's certainly helped us more than hurt us at our particular company.<p>There are some negatives, but for me, the positives of smoking and coding far outweigh the negatives.<p>YMMV.",1197225089

When I write code and am entirely awake, I often get bored or distracted, or keep trying to rethink ways to solve the problem better.<p>I definitely can't code after a beer.",1197224668

87487,comment,87392,87392,0,0,jey,,,"It worked for me when I wrote GCC-CIL, and that was one of my most productive periods ever. I worked a 40 hour/wk job at a research lab and hacked on GCC-CIL on evenings and weekends, progressing so quickly that it freaked out my mentor. But this data point really means nothing... it's probably just an indication that you have to be either drugged or insane to hack GCC's internals without vomiting.<p>Overall, I don't recommend it. Do it every once in a while and you might have some cool ideas, but I bet you'll spend most of your time giggling and watching The Simpsons. I have not experimentally confirmed this, but apparently proper use of hallucinogens is the way to go for broadening perspective  and etc. I'm personally interested in learning meditation techniques and seeing what sorts of effects that can have on the mind.",1197223945

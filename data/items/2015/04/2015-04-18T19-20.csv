After my first few years of college, I still had no social network and very few friends. After rushing a fraternity, I became part of an ultra-inclusive group and made friends and bonds that have lasted the rest of my life.<p>Don&#x27;t rush a fraternity or sorority for the connections - you&#x27;ll be sorely disappointed when you find out 95% of the other members are just normal people from a normal background.

Parent comment is serious, they&#x27;re a huge time sink - especially during your pledging semester.<p>Do rush a fraternity/sorority if you want a head start in social/management experience.

I think that human experience and emotions are complex, and that for various reasons, extremes of unhappiness may result in these symptoms.<p>Is this even meaningful? What you&#x27;re saying is &#x27;emotions are complex so feeling X might just be a more extreme version of Y even though it sometimes shares no properties with Y whatsoever&#x27; - doesn&#x27;t that mean I can now say any experience is just an extreme version of any other?<p>Schizophrenia is really a lot like extreme happiness! You have any problem with that?<p>>On the contrary, I don&#x27;t see why we need to put things into special categories in order to respect people&#x27;s problems and properly judge their seriousness.<p>I didn&#x27;t say put them in &#x27;special categories&#x27; (most of the &#x27;mainstream&#x27; attitude I experience is that I&#x27;m full of shit and should pull myself together, by the way), I said be careful and don&#x27;t just speculate as if it were a folly in a public place like this, since you risk coming off like you&#x27;re downplaying it. You can categorise however you like, but _back it up_ and have a little compassion. This isn&#x27;t a programming language pissing match.<p>Saying severe depression is a more extreme sadness potentially implies you should do some lovely happy nice things to fix it like you can with milder sadness - much like the usual bullshit I hear about how if only I did more exercise it&#x27;d all be fixed and really you can fix it if you just put some effort in! Never mind that the lead PT of the biggest fitness brand in the UK jumped off a cliff, or that many people with seemingly great lives have committed suicide...<p>Saying something is just more of something else, implies that usual fixes apply, just you need to do more.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you think any of this, but that you need to tread carefully - these are actually I think (and experience) most people&#x27;s views anyway, even if they don&#x27;t want to say it, so both for depressives and those who might interact with them, you&#x27;re potentially doing harm - is you waxing philosophical of more value than that potential harm?",1429386632

Whether or not depression is physical, <i>thinking</i> that depression is physical has a tangible effect on the condition itself, one that this author and I would argue is sometimes (though not always!) negative.<p>However, it is in the interest of pharmaceutical companies that it be thought of as purely physical, with purely physical treatments.  And it can be argued that this mode of treatment, and this mental model in the minds of the sufferers is self-reinforcing.  Because it is presented as a physiological ill, depressed persons see it as such, and eschew or don&#x27;t fully invest themselves in alternative solutions, which make them not work.<p>The sum of all of this is that depression is one of the few diseases that is actually itself shaped by the marketing of its treatments.

This time, he visited the Macintosh offices at Texaco Towers to show off his brand new oval routines, which were implemented using a really clever algorithm.<p>Bill had added new code to QuickDraw (which was still called LisaGraf at this point) to draw circles and ovals very quickly. That was a bit hard to do on the Macintosh, since the math for circles usually involved taking square roots, and the 68000 processor in the Lisa and Macintosh didn&#x27;t support floating point operations. But Bill had come up with a clever way to do the circle calculation that only used addition and subtraction, not even multiplication or division, which the 68000 could do, but was kind of slow at.<p>Bill&#x27;s technique used the fact the sum of a sequence of odd numbers is always the next perfect square (For example, 1 + 3 = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, etc). So he could figure out when to bump the dependent coordinate value by iterating in a loop until a threshold was exceeded. This allowed QuickDraw to draw ovals very quickly.<p>Bill fired up his demo and it quickly filled the Lisa screen with randomly-sized ovals, faster than you thought was possible. But something was bothering Steve Jobs. &quot;Well, circles and ovals are good, but how about drawing rectangles with rounded corners? Can we do that now, too?&quot;<p>&quot;No, there&#x27;s no way to do that. In fact it would be really hard to do, and I don&#x27;t think we really need it&quot;. I think Bill was a little miffed that Steve wasn&#x27;t raving over the fast ovals and still wanted more.<p>Steve suddenly got more intense. &quot;Rectangles with rounded corners are everywhere! Just look around this room!&quot;. And sure enough, there were lots of them, like the whiteboard and some of the desks and tables. Then he pointed out the window. &quot;And look outside, there&#x27;s even more, practically everywhere you look!&quot;. He even persuaded Bill to take a quick walk around the block with him, pointing out every rectangle with rounded corners that he could find.<p>When Steve and Bill passed a no-parking sign with rounded corners, it did the trick. &quot;OK, I give up&quot;, Bill pleaded. &quot;I&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s as hard as I thought.&quot; He went back home to work on it.<p>Bill returned to Texaco Towers the following afternoon, with a big smile on his face. His demo was now drawing rectangles with beautifully rounded corners blisteringly fast, almost at the speed of plain rectangles. When he added the code to LisaGraf, he named the new primitive &quot;RoundRects&quot;. Over the next few months, roundrects worked their way into various parts of the user interface, and soon became indispensable.<p><a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Round_Rects_Are_E...</a>",1429385846

9400704,comment,9400696,9400696,0,0,mudil,,,"Full Text:<p>Imagine a land where the most highly educated citizens work for a pittance. Where the local lord treats them more or less as he pleases because the supply of workers is greater than the work available. Where the nobles enjoy lives of relative ease and comfort while the people who do most of the work struggle to make ends meet.<p>These aren’t the sans-culottes of late 18th-century France. We’re talking about the modern American university. Specifically, Harvard—at least if you believe the complaints by the graduate students trying to unionize there. They have a case, too, even if their solution isn’t the cure they think it is. Even taking into account the value of the tuition relief that grad students receive in exchange for the teaching and research they do, their low pay and limited benefits are all too real.<p>These grad students (and part-time adjuncts) carry much of the teaching load at universities for one reason: They are cheaper. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, at Harvard the average professor’s salary is $205,000. Grad students get a fraction of this, and the glut of Ph.D.s means most will never find the professorships they seek.<p>Public universities are covered by state labor laws, and some have unionized. Private universities come under the National Labor Relations Act. They have been able to resist unionization because the National Labor Relations Board ruled in 2004 in a case involving Brown University that grad students are “primarily students,” not employees.<p>That may change. President Obama’s NLRB is a wholly owned subsidiary of organized labor. Last month the board agreed to hear a petition by graduate students at Columbia University that challenges the 2004 decision. The Columbia students want to join the United Auto Workers, and they’re seeking an NLRB ruling like the one last year that Northwestern football players can unionize because they’re employees more than student-athletes.<p>The universities argue that unionization would make the nature of their relationship with students adversarial. They too have a case. Most of America’s top universities aren’t unionized. So the schools have valid concern about elevating union interests over academic merit. Meanwhile, NYU is a rare private university that has voluntarily recognized a grad-student union.<p>But none of this lets academe off the hook. For one thing, the universities contribute to a glut of Ph.D.s by admitting students who take out loans (some 40% of the $1 trillion in student debt is for graduate school) even when they know few will ever work as full professors. By admitting them into graduate programs, the schools in effect are producing for themselves a low-paid work force.<p>“To put it crudely, they are hiring their own serfs,” says Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economist who runs the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. He says it’s “as much a moral issue as an economic one.” A university truly devoted to the well-being of its students would be more honest to grad students about the dismal job prospects for Ph.D.s—and more candid to undergrads about their actual instructors.<p>Unionization isn’t the best solution for grad students or universities. Mr. Vedder has a better idea when he suggests that universities accept some responsibility for defaults on student loans or pick up some of the tab for students who can’t find jobs after graduation.<p>All of which is worth keeping in mind next time you hear university officials lecture America about corporate greed or the wages of garment workers in Guatemala.",1429385180

While not an in-depth tome by any means on depression, treatment, or evolutionary origin, the book is a wonderful first step for those who wish to better understand the illness from a scientific viewpoint.

(beyond the simple two hot ends next to each other).<p>From a 3D printer perspective they are under powered and over priced, which has never been a position of strength for any product to build brand.<p>So its sad to see them fade but not unexpected.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ff3dp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ff3dp.com/</a><p>[2] Replicator/Dual clone -- <a href=""http://www.ff3dp.com/#!product/prd2/1102918641/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ff3dp.com/#!product/prd2/1102918641/</a>",1429383815

For me, the book made many good cases that there is something deeper and quite simple about all storytelling, without ever specifically defining it. I guess that is why storytelling is still such an interesting practice.",1429383735

There&#x27;s a chicken-and-egg problem, though, where I live in a city that I doubt will get a host spontaneously (Amarillo, TX) but I&#x27;d want to attend one of these to get a feel for it before I&#x27;m willing to host one myself. I wonder if there&#x27;s an opportunity there, to have a sort of &quot;training materials&quot; that can better bootstrap a host in this kind of situation.",1429383677

With a territory of just 7 km^2 and with almost nothing at all already done (no people, no economy, no buildings, no services…) it pretty much seems as an utopic idea and like the country won&#x27;t last too much. Just hope they get some progress soon…",1429383611

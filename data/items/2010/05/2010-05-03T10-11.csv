No sane company wants to be dependent on others.<p>As for them choosing h.264 - that's simple too - h.264 is open standard (as in, no single company or other entity has the ability to change it at some random point in some random way) and is widely used already (i.e. there is a lot of software and hardware support).

This critical addition to Monitis’ already revolutionary toolkit enables users to not only monitor their servers, but immediately fix them, as well.<p>Available free within Monitis’ all-in-one suite of tools, the new SSH/Telnet Server Management Tool is activated when users click on the SSH/Telnet icon.  This opens a telnet screen, which enables users to access a given server and perform server management functions like restarting applications and cleaning storage.
Lightweight and available from any web browser, Monitis’ new SSH/Telnet Server Management Tool opens SSH/Telnet access to any device connected to the internet.  Besides supporting ANSI formatting and enabling file uploads via SCP, the tool is especially useful when users setup Cloud monitoring.  The auto-login feature means there is no need to remember logins and IP addresses – routine hassles that are inconvenient and drain time and productivity from IT managers’ already overloaded schedules.  
Monitis already offers platform-independent monitoring of public and private clouds (like Amazon’s EC2 or Rackspace’s cloud), and provides lists of running instances.  With its new SSH/Telnet Server Management Tool, Monitis users now only need to click on an instance and open automatically logged-in terminal access to that particular service.  This significantly reduces the time required to fix problems and ultimately leads to better up-time. 
According to Monitis’ Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan, “Monitis’ new SSH/Telnet Server Management Tool changes the game.  It helps IT managers move from monitoring problems to fixing them in one-click.  It further reinforces our mission of helping the world’s IT managers save massive amounts of time.”",1272881103

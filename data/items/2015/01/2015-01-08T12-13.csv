With GeoCities, they removed the need for a user to figure out hosting, running a server and purchasing a domain name (very expensive at the time). However, with GeoCities, you still needed to know how to write HTML/CSS/JS and use FTP. MySpace took it a step further from that point and did most of the HTML/CSS leg work but allowed for some minor alterations. Facebook took it even further and basically said, &quot;we&#x27;ll do all the leg work for you, all you need to do is type in a thought or upload a picture.&quot;",1420721902

Juvenile phrases about how anyone suffering these days deserves their fate. &quot;Why didn&#x27;t they just learn JavaScript!?&quot;.<p>Oh, but if it&#x27;s the poor and blue collar there will be some pity for their fate, barely masked contempt for the unwashed masses. But the middle class? Eviscerated and this forum spits on their grave. The story goes that they squandered their privileged position in the world.<p>No one can write a proper response. No one can address the content in the author&#x27;s essay because there is no respect nor understanding for what has been written. Like frothing lobotomized acolytes of McLuhan the only mantra is that the &quot;median is the only message&quot;.<p>Human subjectivity is reduced to a cold bowl of porridge. Everyone&#x27;s opinions are equally dismissible. The only thing that matters is what can be quantified. The size of one&#x27;s paycheck takes precedence. Further irony is that everyone thinks they are &quot;creatives&quot; and better than those mongrels in finance or law. This is just our generations version of the Wolf of Wall Street but in the lambs clothes of the globally cultured. &quot;We teach people to code so they can better their economic stature and increase their quantifiable measurements and therefor become a better and happier person!&quot;.<p>Downvotes and upvotes... those ARE part of the problem! They destroy dialog. It turns what could be healthy discussion in an American Idol like popularity contest. &quot;Vote next week for your favorite asshole!&quot;. You think it is an ethical device? Have you ever noticed that tptacek, the holder of the most &quot;karma&quot; on HN is basically a troll? My language is in no way more inflammatory than his. He&#x27;s just got the foot soldiers to put people in their place.<p>All that these things do is turn forums in to an echo chamber. The other approach is to use active moderation to get rid of the trolls. But that&#x27;s not the agenda. That&#x27;s not the belief. The church of quantification must attempt to remove all subjective and therefor inefficient human biases.<p>Label them &quot;gatekeepers&quot; and convince the world you&#x27;re doing it a service when you instead shift the power to secretive algorithms that are controlled by a small cabal of wealthy elites.<p>DOWNVOTE THIS!<p><pre><code>  ....................../´¯/)

8856141,comment,8856043,8856043,0,0,junto,,,"Site seems a bit slow, so here&#x27;s the abstract:<p>Abstract<p>Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment are advised to increase food intake to overcome the therapy-induced side effects, and weight loss. Dietary restriction is known to slow down the aging process and hence reduce age-related diseases such as cancer. Fasting or short-term starvation is more effective than dietary restriction to prevent cancer growth since starved cells switch off signals for growth and reproduction and enter a protective mode, while cancer cells, being mutated, are not sensitized by any external growth signals and are not protected against any stress. This phenomenon is known as differential stress resistance (DSR). Nutrient signaling pathways involving growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis and its downstream effectors, play a key role in DSR in response to starvation controlling the other cell maintenance systems, such as autophagy and apoptosis, that are related to the tumorigenesis. Yeast cells lacking these effectors are better protected against oxidative stress compared to normal cells. In the same way, starvation protects many cell lines and mice against high-dose chemotherapeutic drugs. According to a series of studies, fasting results in overall reduction in chemotherapy side effects in cancer patients. Data shows that starvation-dependent differential chemotherapy is safe, feasible and effective in cancer treatment, but the possible side effects of starvation limit its efficacy. However, further studies and clinical trials may result in its implementation in cancer treatment.<p>Keywords: Starvation; Dietary restriction; Differential stress resistance; Differential chemotherapy; Nutrient-signaling pathways.",1420721426

There are vessels with cranes on them, those are usually not full container ships but more like vessels which mostly handle trucks+cars plus occasional container or breakbulk cargo.<p>The latest terminal in Rotterdam has switched to working remotely with camera&#x27;s because it has become impossible to put anyone on a crane, see e.g. following video.

8856021,comment,8855421,8855421,0,0,amelius,,,"Search has imho become too much of both a privacy intrusion, and at the same time too much of a market determinant. I think the following has to happen.<p>(Just thinking out loud).<p>- Search has to be made into a replaceable service, or a commodity. This means that one could easily switch search providers without any other noticeable difference (to the user) than a difference in search results.<p>- This means that search engines should be stripped of their user-interface.<p>- Search engines should &quot;be&quot; simply APIs that browsers can hook into.
An advantage of this, is that search engines could be denied the use of scripting, which disables the possibility of user tracking through &quot;device fingerprinting&quot;.<p>- Of course, if desired, the user could enable personalization. Personalization could be handled like it is now (through user tracking). But we could invent an API that reveals only a user&#x27;s interests to a search agent. For example, you could reveal that you are researcher or a programmer, interested in technology, and certain programming languages, and you could list a set of webpages that you use regularly.<p>- Of course, different profiles could be used for different searches.<p>I imagine that the privacy-aware engines like DDG could start with the development and implementation of these protocols, and cooperate with e.g. mozilla for a base client implementation.",1420718744

If you tilt it so much the &quot;Y&quot; axis becomes paralel to the X axis, then you lost something.<p>Instead of &quot;orthogonal&quot; what you need is a mathematical property called independence (as in linearly independent) that basically means &quot;not redundant to express a space&quot;",1420718738

8856018,comment,8855502,8855502,0,0,72deluxe,,,"Cisco sell a Wireless LAN controller, which can send disconnect packets to &quot;rogue&quot; APs that get set up, rendering them useless. This is particularly important at events where the airspace is severely cramped, such as big arena events, racing, horse racing etc. where the myriad of APs to provide coverage of free wifi to pundits would have to compete with these other APs. In a severely crammed airspace, this would help to encourage the other AP providers to turn their boxes off.<p>And getting a mobile telephone call in such events is even trickier, given that 50,000 people are in one space and the masts to serve them are oversubscribed. If they all suddenly want to place bets or browse the web, that&#x27;s incredibly difficult to provide on the mast, so providers will set up additional masts for big events (like the big horse-racing events here in the UK). That&#x27;s why they provide free wifi too, and having other APs set up and attempting to provide wifi over the airspace doesn&#x27;t really help.<p>I wonder if Marriott hotels have the same approach in order to provide better wifi coverage? I have been in numerous hotels where the wifi coverage was great if you&#x27;re sat in the bar but abysmal if you&#x27;re down the other end of the building (where the hotels here in the UK are large old buildings with thick walls, very tricky for wifi).<p>Irritating if you&#x27;re trying to use your phone to provide wifi to your laptop in order SSH to your own box at home or to get content via your mobile (which might be faster than their Internet access in some cases). I suppose you could just use a Bluetooth PAN instead (and it uses less power!)",1420718670

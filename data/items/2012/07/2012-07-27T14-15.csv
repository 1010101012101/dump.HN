Cara Tradisional Mengobati Asam Urat dengan Ace maxs memang menjadi pilihan yang tepat. Walupun di bilang obat tradisional ace maxs diproses dengan sangat modern. Karena pengolahan ace maxs di dukung dengan teknologi canggih, hal ini dibuktikan karena demi menjaga keaslian mutu dan bahan baku yang terkandung dalam komposisi tersebut.<p>Ace Maxs yang terbuat dari kulit manggis dan daun sirsak bisa mengobati asam urat dengan tuntas dan aman, mengapa? Ini karena kandungan berbagai senyawa yang ada di dalamnya. Kulit manggis yang menghasilkan warna merah keunguan, dan amat sulit dibersihkan. Karena mengandung tanin, resin, dan crystallizable mangostine (C20H22O5), yang mudah larut dalam alkohol atau ether, tidak larut dalam air. Kulit manggis amat berkhasiat untuk membuang asam urat di dalam tubuh. Selain itu kandungan xanthone di dalam kulit manggis memiliki sifat sebagai antiperadangan dan bisa meredakan nyeri.
Kandungan senyawa tannin, fitosterol, caoksalat, dan alkaloid murisine dalam daun sirsak dipercaya mampu mengatasi asam urat. Sirsak juga memiliki efek diuretic (peluruh kencing) yang membuat sekresi asam urat melalui urine dapat berjalan lancer. Daun sirsak memiliki sifat anti-inflamasi (menekan peradangan) serta meredakan rasa nyeri yang timbul akibat terbentuknya kristal-kristal asam urat.",1343400904

I'd like to see more ways to interact and make the knowledge part of one's own experiences rather than as received truth (something Polanyi got mostly right in his Personal Knowledge book). Of course I'm instantly suspicious of any technique or product that tries to oversell its ability to teach concepts faster with better retention, and even more suspicious when it tries to sell itself as ""it's so fun the user won't even realize they are learning!"" That said, I can see benefits of various systems over both doing nothing and the status quo. Tools like Anki for instance work well, if used. The advice some programming texts give to manually type the programs also has obvious benefits, basically a subset of techniques that train the mind to follow and notice common actions. (There was an app linked on HN a few weeks ago that replicates the motions of solving algebra problems without actually doing any algebra, I can see how ""eliminating two like things from both sides"" feeling ""okay"" may help some people a little.) Khan has mentioned that he has offline students watch lecture videos as homework and do problems or answer questions during classroom time, the opposite of the traditional school, I can see its benefits over the traditional method too for classes where information is typically transferred via lecture.<p>What things like KA, AcademicEarth, and Wikipedia all have in common though is that they change the utility function of learning. That is, when they're not being used as crutches to get through the traditional schools. Students can learn what they want, when they want, stress-free. The classical model is ""pass the tests with scores above this threshold or die."" (Not literally of course.) It encourages cramming and forgetting. Cumulative testing doesn't help because the course only lasts maximally 9 months (with a big break in the middle), and at higher levels only 3-4 months. Sometimes it's even just one term rather than a full semester. It's not enough. Add in repetition of the <i>wrong things</i> (it's always the <i>most basic</i> things that get repeated endlessly when they're the easiest things to remember!), poor communication between professors of what they actually cover, poor communication between student and professor of what the student actually understands, fixed deadlines, anxiety over money (whether living expenses or paying $1500 for a dumb class), anxiety over spending X hours of your life for a useless class/assignment, <i>retaking</i> the entirety of a class instead of focusing on what you're missing specifically, being forced to take classes one has no interest or skill in, being exposed to one resource, <i>et cetera</i>, it's amazing the classical system works at all.",1343400440

There is nothing good I can say about Gnome3...  trying to use it was painful in about every way I could imagine.  Nothing works the way I expect, and nothing was intuitive at all.<p>KDE, on the other hand, has been a pleasant surprise.  I'd dabbled with it 10+ years ago, but never made the permanent switch... and given that they had gone through their own ""change everything and piss off all the users"" thing a while back, I wasn't sure what to expect.

It took a few minutes to figure out some of the new approaches they've adopted but - by and large - a little trail and error, some exploration, and intuition, and I was back to productive work almost immediately.<p>I have no hard feelings towards the Gnome team or anything, but they're just trying to go in a direction that I'm not interested in.

It would be very expensive to rewire the home with fiber or even ethernet.  Presumably if Google was building a CDN they wouldn't want to be reliant on standard wiring in their customers' homes.  Also that sleek-looking TV box would probably have to be much larger if it doubled as an ONT (the one in my basement is huge).  Seems a little impractical if my assumptions are correct.<p>Edit: I don't mean to dismiss your idea about the value of Google reserving some space on the disk for their own purposes.  Cable & satellite operators already do that today.  Technology exists for example that allows the operators to cache household-targeted TV ads on the disk.

Especially, mathematics is much too important to be left to the United States public school system in its current condition.<p>I was just rereading The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World's Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom (1999) the other day. It reminded me of facts I had already learned from other sources, including living overseas for two three-year stays in east Asia.<p>""Readers who are parents will know that there are differences among American teachers; they might even have fought to move their child from one teacher's class into another teacher's class. Our point is that these differences, which appear so large within our culture, are dwarfed by the gap in general methods of teaching that exist across cultures. We are not talking about gaps in teachers' competence but about a gap in teaching methods."" p. x<p>""When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country's lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons--that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons. They allow us to detect the underlying commonalities that define particular systems of teaching, commonalities that otherwise hide in the background."" p. 77<p>Plenty of authors, including some who should be better known and mentioned more often by the co-authors of the article Colin kindly submitted here, have had plenty of thoughtful things to say about ways in which United States mathematical education could improve.<p>In February 2012, Annie Keeghan wrote a blog post, ""Afraid of Your Child's Math Textbook? You Should Be,""<p><a href=""http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_of_your_childs_math_textbook_you_should_be"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_o...</a><p>in which she described the current process publishers follow in the United States to produce new mathematics textbook. Low bids for writing, rushed deadlines, and no one with a strong mathematical background reviewing the books results in school textbooks that are not useful for learning mathematics. Moreover, although all new textbook series in the United States are likely to claim that they ""expose"" students to the Common Core standards, they are not usually designed carefully to develop mathematical understanding according to any set of standards.<p>In a January 2012 lecture,<p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf</a><p>Professor Hung-hsi Wu of UC Berkeley points out a problem of fraction addition from the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey project. On page 39 of his presentation handout (numbered in the .PDF of his lecture notes as page 38), he shows the fraction addition problem<p>12/13 + 7/8<p>for which eighth grade students were not even required to give a numerically exact answer, but only an estimate of the correct answer to the nearest natural number from five answer choices. Even at that, very few students chose the correct answer.<p>Patricia Clark Kenschaft, professor of mathematics at Montclair State University in New Jersey, reported in her article ""Racial Equity Requires Teaching Elementary School Teachers More Mathematics"" in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>about elementary teachers' knowledge of mathematics in New Jersey:<p>""The teachers are eager and able to learn. I vividly remember one summer class when I taught why the multiplication algorithm works for two-digit numbers using  base ten blocks. I have no difficulty doing this with third graders, but this particular class was all elementary school teachers. At the end of the half hour, one third-grade teacher raised her hand. 'Why wasnt I told this secret before?' she demanded. It was one of those rare speechless moments for Pat Kenschaft. In the quiet that ensued, the teacher stood up.<p>""'Did you know this secret before?' she asked the person nearest her. She shook her head. 'Did you know this secret before?' the inquirer persisted, walking around the class. 'Did you know this secret before?' she kept asking. Everyone shook her or his head. She whirled around and looked at me with fury in her eyes. 'Why wasnt I taught this before?  Ive been teaching third grade for thirty years. If I had been taught this thirty years ago, I could have been such a better teacher!!!'""<p>A discussion of the Common Core Standards in Mathematics, ""The Common Core Math StandardsAre they a step forward or backward?""<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/the-common-core-math-standards/</a><p>gets into further details of how mathematicians look at the general school curriculum in the United States. It is not the worst curriculum possible, and survivors of the system often have access to outside resources to supplement school lessons, but the public school instruction in mathematics in the United States still shows plenty of room for improvement.<p>After edit: I was asked in a reply what I think about the essay ""Lockhart's Lament."" I think it is an interesting read, but less practical for reforming mathematics education than I had hoped. (I say the same in general about articles by Keith Devlin, the mathematician who popularized Lockhart's Lament.) To reform education, it is important to be relentlessly empirical, and look again and again and again at the best practices of the highest-achieving countries. That's why I prefer several of the links I submitted to Lockhart's interesting essay as policy guidance for United States parents, taxpayers, and learners.<p>Another edit: HN user danso just kindly posted<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4301758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4301758</a><p>a link to a response by Sal Khan in the same Washington Post op-ed column about education.

If you have, eg a switch with 10 1Gb ports[1], and 1 1Gb uplink, and 4 of those are doing something intensive enough to saturate that uplink, someone who requests say, a full download of the gmail client, then it could go strictly across the switch to  one of the other 6 local google boxes that has a cache of that, and at a lower latency and impact on other people than going to through the uplink to the nearest cache.<p>Now, this could also be done in the switch closet, you are right. However, since this would have to also go through either the uplink, or every switch would need a port dedicated to a cache network/box, it would start getting expensive at switching points. Each would start looking like a mini-data (micro? nano?) center. At that point, you could just eat that cost, or say ""what are alternatives that cost the same or less in capex and opex?"" Perhaps with Google's network-fu, they have solved similar problems in data centers already, and said ""we can use our caching/routing stuff here, and put a small capex increase each customer box, which we also need no matter what, and decrease switching point capex, and since it is a simpler network, reduce opex too"".<p>Essentially, it is a similar problem to the one bittorrent solves, just at a different scale/locality. It also starts to look like solutions some vendors/ISPs looked into at one point for bittorrent - instead of stopping bittorrent, keep a map of local people seeing segments and reroute requests for those segments to the local network rather than across the uplink.<p>[1] assume a decent switch with a full mesh backplane.

I wrote a blog post about this a while back: <a href=""http://cyclicreality.com/post/26719449459/why-khan-academy-is-great"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyclicreality.com/post/26719449459/why-khan-academy-i...</a><p>The hype may be too much.

Like when your weekend is Wednesday and Thursday, then you can't spend your weekends with your normal working wife and your school children. Also, when you drink beer on your desk and don't push yourself through unproductive times, you will never get anything done. And who pays the bills then?\nAlso children always have a hard time understanding that the father, always being home, has times where he is working - not available - and times where you can go and talk to him. I NEVER got that as a child. For the child that also doesn't feel like dad is home more often, but that he spends less time with them then he could.\nI could tell you so much more annoying things, without even working as an Indie and just being 25 years old (so having not much life experience myself).<p>That is why I am quite disappointed that you write an analysis of your job without being able to weigh pros and cons.

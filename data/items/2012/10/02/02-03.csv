Since 2000, the US money supply has increased from about $600 billion to about $2.6 trillion.  That is a 300% increase in the amount of USD around - it's little wonder that a barrel of oil has tripled in value as well over the same period for that same currency.<p>The truth is that gas prices, adjusted for inflation, are about the same as they were 30 years ago.  It's just a shame that most people can't adjust their income to inflation easily, and so see their gasoline bill eating up more of their disposable income than they would like.<p>So next time you shake your fist at the oil companies for gouging you, remember to shake the other fist at the Federal Reserve for devaluing your currency.

They're my favorite data structure, maybe.<p>A story:<p>Back in the 70s it appeared that every major state university had to do their own version of PL/1. At the University of Maryland it was called PL/UM. I don't know why, maybe it was a testosterone thing (""IBM took a zillion man-years to write PL/1, but look what WE did with three starving grad students, a half-soused half-professor and a keypunch operator!"") (Yeah, another version of PL/1, and that doesn't necessarily make the world a better place. Anyway --)<p>PLUM was notorious for being slow (I don't know about bugs, but they were probably there, too), and it was pretty common for students using PLUM to have to grovel for more seconds of CPU time.<p>Five or six years into PLUM's use as a student language, someone discovered that all of the symbols were being hashed into the same bucket.<p>PLUM got amazingly fast (well, faster, at least) after that. But by then anyone with a clue had managed to scam an account on one of the bsd Vaxen and write their stuff in C.<p>Don't take hash tables on faith. Measure, measure, measure.",1349145927

It keeps track of all your bills, reminds you when the due dates are coming up, notifies you of unusually high charges, and connects to over 4400 financial institutions to pull in exact billing amounts and let you pay bills from up to 10 different bank accounts. They'll print and mail the checks for you if you don't want to or can't pay electronically.<p>The only thing it doesn't do is know the exact amount due for non-participating companies. Since you are afraid of automatic payments (and 100x mistake scenarios about as likely as winning the lottery), you'll be reviewing your bills manually anyway, so typing in a bill amount once or twice a month doesn't seem like such an inconvenience that it'd be valuable enough to get all the ISPs and utilities to participate.<p>That's about as good as you'll ever get. Getting every little landlord, every township/city water and sewer company, every trash collector, etc. to connect to some service to push customer bills to it is impossible.

Take the burden off your shoulders and clear your head. After getting some peace in your mind, you can take action:<p>The first thing you have to do is to tell your client/boss, without all the computer-techy talk, the situation you're in and how it's going to actually affect them. Clients get pissed off not because things don't ""work"" or the user experience is ""broken"". Clients get pissed off because they <i>expected</i> them to ""work"" and the experience is ""nice"". Clients have <i>expectations</i>, and most of the time (for non-techie clients), they have unrealistic expectations. Set their expectation and make them understand the ramifications of having ONE guy working on such a massive undertaking under your specific circumstances.<p>After you do this you'll find that it's much easier to breathe in and actually work. In goodwill, they will set aside time and plan things to actually help you, because they know in the end it will help them.<p>Next steps are usual dev protocols:<p>1. Get it in version control with a dead simple bug/issue tracking system.<p>2. Always write good commit comments.<p>3. As for documentation, do it incrementally. Write small bits each time you work with the app, or each time you deal with your build/deployment process. It will compile into good documentation later on. If possible get your documentation into version control as well.<p>I highly recommend that you do these things and produce a consistent flow of routines in your work before getting other people to help code with you. It doesn't help when you have another person sitting around burning precious time figuring out things as he goes along the way. On-boarding them without those 3 things listed will be hard, and it will put off a good amount of time from things that actually need attention.<p>If you're implementing Agile on a personal level, make sure other people are on-boarded with it.<p>You'll find that adding people will be much easier. The cost of logistics regarding adding additional team members rises higher than expected if the development workflow and environment isn't established. You'll burn time on-boarding good developers, you'll burn even more time on-boarding mediocre developers (I've personally experienced this in my previous work).<p>Hope this helps.",1349144961

I'm a bit surprised to see it here.<p>It claims that it's a myth that ""trees are better"" than hash tables and just describes trees as better for ""finding inexact matches"", as in the example ""finding all names that begin with B"".  That's too vague.  It's misleading because:<p>1. Trees can't just answer any random vague questions, such as ""Find all names that have a P anywhere"".  That doesn't really describe the advantages of trees.  I think a more accurate formulation would be ""iterating over a range of values"" or ""finding values based on some ordering"" (eg. find the smallest element bigger than X).  Or for walking the entire contents in some predefined order.  Sure, this is not an article about trees, but it doesn't take more than two sentences to describe that in a much better manner.<p>2. For any of the former query patterns, trees <i>are</i> actually much better than hash tables.  That's definitely not a myth, which this article would sorta have you believe.<p>> Chained hash tables are a very good idea. Problem solved.<p>Wrong.  If you don't resize your hash table, the complexity of accesses <i>will</i> degrade linearly as it exceeds its size.  If your hash uses, say, 100 buckets each with a linked lists and stores N > 100 values, an access has complexity O(N) (sure, O(N/100) in the best case (assuming perfect spread of hash keys), but that's really O(N)).<p>Finally, ""The worst case is terrible"" myth part seems somewhat naive.  I think it should at least mention the idea of hash table collision DOS attacks.  ""This doesn't happen in practice"" unless there's some attacker out to get you by triggering that.  There's plenty of examples of that happening in practice, of systems vulnerable to that.

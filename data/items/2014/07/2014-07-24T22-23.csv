Diversity in language design, in the implementation of new languages, and even in the extension of currently popular languages, is a good thing (TM).  It means being able to learn a new approach or technique (anonymous functions, monads, templates, erlang-esque pattern matching, etc) and be able to integrate it into the projects you&#x27;ve already spent 5 years of your life on.<p>(edit: missing comma)",1406242787

You should go in investing with long haul mindset. You can&#x27;t be right all the time in making your calls so consistency in investing pays.

8082836,comment,8081556,8081556,1,0,Jach,,,"Alternatively... Since the government forces me to bring my vehicle to one of their locations every other year for emissions testing, have them install a speed control unit with a beacon to communicate with other cars. (Yes it will be harder to install on some cars than others -- even just the beacon would be valuable.) Over the course of five years, retrofit every vehicle with a beacon and have it already installed on new cars, have severe penalties for vehicles caught driving around not broadcasting their signal, and now everyone can have a bit more automation in their automobiles since the systems will enforce safe merge gaps and other nice things like computer-enforced speed limits. Plus it prepares everyone for a fully automated experience that can come sometime in the 2020s.<p>I can dream right?",1406242736

I&#x27;m not a HN regular, but I&#x27;ve been following this thread all day because I have a friend who worked at Amicus, and several others who have worked with their software. I know there are always many sides to any story. I wasn&#x27;t there, just like most of you weren&#x27;t there, but all I can say is Seth&#x27;s version of this story does NOT fit with what I&#x27;ve heard, and everything I&#x27;ve heard has been from honest, cool people who - unlike Seth - don&#x27;t have a history of lying about really important shit.<p>Seth absolutely deserves to have a forum to tell his version of the story, but I find it more than a little annoying that after everything he&#x27;s done, he&#x27;s still able to leverage his position as a YC Founder to ensure that his version of the story gets more attention than anyone else&#x27;s.<p>Based on everything I&#x27;ve heard, I&#x27;d say this post is essentially about admitting to lesser crimes so the world forgives him before we even know what he really did or did not do.<p>I&#x27;d urge the media powers that be to try and get some former employees, investors,customers, etc., on the record.

Anybody (here or elsewhere) would have made the same decision.. Their fault is that they waited as long as they did.<p>Google+ also makes some sense because it does tie services like GDrive, blogs, photos, docs, videos (youtube), and chat together. The problem there was that they got spooked by Facebook and tried to copy it exactly (e.g. the real name policy, which was always stupid but they did it because facebook did it).

But I&#x27;ve also heard of Mother Teresa. My knowing even good things about a person doesn&#x27;t necessarily impact how good of a person they actually were. I remember reading books as a kid with Mother Teresa in them as a totally sanctified figure, but what Christopher Hitchens says about her is probably true, and so she&#x27;s not worth the respect that I gained for her and carried with me for so long.<p>I think it is an astute observation.

I wonder if it&#x27;s a common occurrence or if this is an outlier situation.<p>There is way too much capital chasing too few opportunities today. The bar for who and what gets funded at seed stage is extremely low. Social proof and accelerator cred clearly often substitute for due diligence.<p>Exacerbating this is the prevalence of party rounds in which lots of investors put in relatively small chunks of capital. For obvious reasons, if you&#x27;re raising a $6 million Series A from two or three name firms on Sand Hill Road, you&#x27;re probably going to be subjected to a lot more scrutiny than if you&#x27;re raising a $3 million round from a group that consists of upwards of 10 angels and/or super angel funds. In the latter scenario, the amount invested per investor tends to be so small that none of the participants have a real incentive to perform rigorous due diligence, which costs money and takes time.<p>According to CB, 15 investors participated in Amicus&#x27; $3.2 million round in 2012.",1406242038

You&#x27;re projecting this as black and white, but in reality performance is a curve and the company&#x27;s economic context determines where that curve ends. Companies growing rapidly hardly ever fire. Companies faced with a squeeze (and perhaps a shortage of profitable work) will be willing to move higher and higher up the performance curve.<p>Your platitudes about morale are simply untrue. I mentioned before specific peers as counter-examples, so let&#x27;s also name the company: Netflix has a policy of firing people who aren&#x27;t top-level performers. It&#x27;s flatly impossible to make these kinds of determinations reliably before a hire -- the ONLY way to maintain a team of A-level players is to fire people who you&#x27;ve hired and who turn out not to perform.<p>This is not theory, this is fact in practice. It works great. People who don&#x27;t make it don&#x27;t like it -- and that&#x27;s largely unimportant. People who actually are A-level performers love it.

Airports often a bit more due to people carrying bags.<p>It&#x27;s also the fact that a Smart car takes up the same space in a parking garage as an original Hummer. I&#x27;ve been in a Costco parking lot where someone in a Mini has parked over the line into the opposing space (overlapping on the front not the sides). I drive an F150 so I pulled tight on him and bumped him and the parking gear rolled me an inch away. I didn&#x27;t grab much (I think it was pop, water and hotdogs/burgers for a party) and got out while he was still loading his car. I dropped my tailgate and started throwing the cases in (and pushing against the tailgate) so that my truck rocked and hit his car. The guy said &quot;Hey buddy, you&#x27;re hitting my car.&quot; I walk around, look at the fronts of the vehicle, take a picture with my phone (my trucks a company vehicle so we get targeted by all sorts of morons who think we punctured their tire) and I said &quot;I don&#x27;t know, it looks like you hit me. I&#x27;m well within my space.&quot;<p>The TL;DR: to that was &quot;People are idiots who can&#x27;t park small cars in big spaces&quot; so I&#x27;m quite confident parking efficiency can be increased dramatically by decreasing wasted parking space.<p>You can also presumably halve the amount of driving lanes required. If only 3 robots serve the entire complex there should be enough routes to never run into them having to travel the same lane at once. That alone could likely increase efficiency dramatically; if a lane is wide enough to drive in, it&#x27;s wide enough to park a car in, and by a guesstimate with no room between vehicles you could likely pack 3 vehicles wide in the width of 2 driving lanes.<p>You also mention packing the cars in. If the software has access to boarding times, and return times then they could presumably pack vehicles in 5 deep or more. You could have a parking space 10 vehicles deep, if you&#x27;ve got lane access on either side you put the cars in ordered by arrival time. Row 1 gets in at 3pm, row 2 gets in at 3:30pm, etc. and you just unload from the opposing side.<p>If you made an entire parking lot structure accessible this way, you could presumably increase parking efficiency well beyond a 50% increase with the reduction of all driving lanes.",1406239388

A lot of them really do come from these &quot;common novice mistakes&quot;. The authors are taking very superficial views of complexity theory and physics against the advice of researchers in those fields. This particular one hasn&#x27;t, but a lot of them have incredibly bad and egotistical attitudes. I think researchers see this as incredibly insulting, ignorant, and a severe lack of humility.

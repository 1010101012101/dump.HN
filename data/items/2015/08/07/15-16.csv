But generally I think more effort should be placed on slowly getting a kitten acclimated to the outside world than something like this.  I&#x27;ve done it with all my cats, basically starting to let them outside around the time they are neutered.<p>The kitten will naturally take a very cautious approach as they slowly explore their environment. It&#x27;s actually fascinating to watch as they slowly gain more confidence and move farther into the brush and edges of your yard/property (provided you have the space).  Eventually getting into tree&#x27;s and exploring up as well as out.<p>They are happier, they are healthier and they live longer.  My first cat that I raised this way lived until 18.",1438963136

This is simply because actually governing the robots is exponentially harder than anything else, and a robot that does not know where it is on the field, where the ball is or is unable to move is also useless - no matter what advanced tactic you decide to deploy. And these are REALLY hard problems!<p>Other problems are: understand which side of the field is actually yours (it&#x27;s not uncommon to do autogoals, since the field is visually symmetrical), how to understand where you are after a referee repositions you, how to distinguish friendly robots from adversaries, not fall down every five seconds.<p>And still the game is driven by simple hardware physics: the robots engines tend to overheat very often, which basically results in the robots &quot;melting&quot; on themselves since they can&#x27;t support their weight for very long. And there how much money a team has to spend comes into play heavily..<p>So to get back at your questions, not much.

10023167,comment,10021376,10022697,0,0,ronjouch,,,"> None of these uses requires the ability to play quake3 inside firefox, or are really applications inside a webpage.<p>Maybe, for now. But WebRTC/WebSockets have a value proposal for real-time interaction in collaborative office suites. Canvas/WebGL have one for performance in authoring tools and for articles illustrations. Documents are readable in your default serif/sans-serif set, but WebFonts are a good designer/author tool just like fonts are in print. Etc... Renouncing this added value because each new feature increases the attack surface sounds like throwing the baby with the bathwater.<p>> I&#x27;m just disappointed in the defeatist attitude of browser vendors and expert users: the idea of having a browser safe mode that you can lock down doesn&#x27;t strike me as such an impossiblity and it would give some incentive to developers to put their act together.<p>Two thoughts:<p>1. Such a &quot;Safe mode&quot; disabling features presents high risks of breaking tons of sites, leaving non-expert users in the dark, and these users are the most likely to be clueless about what&#x27;s wrong and may just switch to another browser.\nIn the case of JavaScript, Firefox is actually going the opposite way of what you want, by making it <i>harder</i> to disable it [1]. The closest to your wish with Firefox is probably to use their LTS version, ESR, where the dust settled for a little while more (but which ironically, <i>was</i> affected by today&#x27;s exploit ^^).<p>2. Can what you are proposing be a &quot;mode&quot;? Take the &quot;Reader View&quot; mode of recent Firefox builds, proposing a Readability-like mode streamlining long reads: this one is clearly a _mode_, you click on it, the text turns big, page gets sepia, side content disappears, you know you&#x27;re in it and you&#x27;re not going to constantly browse with it. But would you alternate between &quot;default&quot; mode and &quot;Safe&quot; mode? What a terrible choice to make, you would certainly stay on &quot;Safe&quot; mode, and at this point it becomes transparent that the browser constantly altering content, deepening cluelessness for non-expert users in case of breakage.<p>2.1. EDIT this reminds me a lot of Polaris tracking protection [2], a project/feature of recent Firefox builds to block http requests of trackers, for privacy. I use the feature, and even I, a moderately &quot;expert&quot; user, was left puzzled when it blocked all the images an article (can&#x27;t recover it, it was a Russian article/domain of a photographer exploring the remnants of a space shuttle launch military site). Anyway, Polaris had the images domain in its blacklist and blocked them. Glancing at the console, I saw Polaris blocking and disabled the time of a page refresh. But how to handle this simply for non-expert users? This is tough to implement, and directly opposes the &quot;don&#x27;t break userland&quot; equivalent of the web.<p>[1] <a href=""http://limi.net/checkboxes-that-kill/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://limi.net/checkboxes-that-kill/</a> , <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873709"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=873709</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968237"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5968237</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Polaris#Tracking_protection"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Polaris#Tracking_protection</a>",1438962791

There is a historical, evolutionary reason for things to be the way they are. The status-quo however is path dependent, and great innovation happens when we figure out the implied assumptions that were path dependent, but are no longer true.<p>The Tyranny of Structurelessness has been brought up here multiple times, but it is still a good reminder for the brave ones pushing boundaries:<p>&quot;For everyone to have the opportunity to be involved in a given group and to participate in its activities the structure must be explicit, not implicit. The rules of decision-making must be open and available to everyone, and this can happen only if they are formalized. This is not to say that formalization of a structure of a group will destroy the informal structure. It usually doesn&#x27;t. But it does hinder the informal structure from having predominant control and make available some means of attacking it if the people involved are not at least responsible to the needs of the group at large. &quot;Structurelessness&quot; is organizationally impossible. We cannot decide whether to have a structured or structureless group, only whether or not to have a formally structured one. Therefore the word will not be used any longer except to refer to the idea it represents. Unstructured will refer to those groups which have not been deliberately structured in a particular manner. Structured will refer to those which have. A Structured group always has formal structure, and may also have an informal, or covert, structure. It is this informal structure, particularly in Unstructured groups, which forms the basis for elites.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm</a>",1438962770

Couple it with a JS client-side library that mimics Django&#x27;s Model and Field APIs, while keeping the best parts from Ember.js (Handlebars/Emblem templates, Components with Actions for template events, Router, and Routes), plus glue code to make the whole thing seamless, real-time, and with an isomorphic feel.<p>If nobody does it, I plan to study compilers with the express goal of attempting it myself.<p>Edit: To clarify, I already know a decent amount of Python and JS/CoffeeScript. The problem is not in learning multiple languages, but in the amount of duplicated logic (especially in the model layer) that could be eliminated via shared code when you write in a single language.",1438962517

Refreshbox is a destination platform which enables people to subscribe or create a 5-link-collection newsletter consisting their weekly professional best read (curate content). It&#x27;s a newsletter platform (not just a tool like mailchimp) and it&#x27;s important for us that it will be a two way street newsletter. The most important things for our curators, those who launched their own newsletters, are subscribers and engagement with their subscribers. When a subscriber gets a newsletter he can: \n1. rate and comment on the newsletter\n2. comment on the links.\n3. Open and click rate.\nThere is a notification sent to the curator when one of these happen. \nMy question to you is: what additional ideas do you have to create engagement between the curators and subscribers? Try to think out of the box. An idea I had is to give subscribers an option to donate to an organization related to the domain of the newsletter if they liked the links they got. That way the curator can see how much money people donated because of the links he curated. Maybe it&#x27;s not the best idea...what are your ides? Thanks a lot!",1438962432

Your comment is premised on the assumption that what you see in newspapers is representative of nutritional science. Like most research, the objective is seldom to immediately impact human health (exceptions: CDC, pharma companies, infectious disease researchers and others do that kind of stuff). Influencing human health outcomes is the hopeful eventual goal of most health-related research, but individual studies and projects are not designed to be end-all conclusions. I&#x27;d be suspicious of studies that claim this. But, read the quote by a co-author on that article. Each research project is designed to fit as a piece of puzzle into the larger picture. If you read the article, the Harvard public health professor puts it best:<p>> “We need more evidence, especially from clinical trials, to further verify these findings,” said a co-author, Dr. Lu Qi, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “and we are looking forward to seeing data from other populations.”",1438962348

An existing open source project (or even perhaps an exiting proprietary product) is likely to think of its users as &quot;those people who currently use the product&quot;, while a startup building a product to be sold to a future larger userbase is going to think of them more broadly. The problem with this is that the former is subject to selection bias. All the people who are currently using the product are by selection, those who have the patience to deal with its&#x27; usability warts.<p>Therefore, if an outsider to a project wants to make a change in favor of usability, they have a much harder time overcoming the objection that changing the code might break things.<p>The same is true on a second level: All of the existing developers of a project are those who are by selection already comfortable with both the development process and the resulting product. If someone wants to join, they have to already be familiar with how the project is structured and how it does things. They probably have to already be comfortable with this. Someone who hates working on projects without automated testing is very unlikely to join such a project and then convince the team to adopt automated testing.<p>Of course, you can&#x27;t just let random new people come into a project without pushing back on them; Often their ideas are genuinely bad ideas which come from a lack of understanding & context.",1438962339

Under a day in some cases.<p>- Not every attack coming physically from China/Russia is from the governments in those countries. A lot of lone blackhats exist all over the world, it is insane to assume it is different there. Just as when you see an attack from the US, it MIGHT be the USG, or it MIGHT just be a lone wolf or wolves. People could also be using endpoints located in China/Russia to hide their true origin.<p>- Due to the way the internet works anyone with some skill can hide their true origin pretty well. We&#x27;re meant to believe that Chinese/Russian hackers are this uber threat, but at the same time that they lack the 101s of hiding their identity and location. Seems contradictory.<p>As to why the US blames China and Russia for &quot;hacking&quot; I believe they have two motives (as an over-simplification):<p>- They can paint these hacks as being highly sophisticated, and therefore avoid the implication that the break-ins are primarily due to incompetence or neglect within the USG (which is almost always the case).<p>- Keeping Russia/China/NK/Iran/etc on a constant &quot;war footing&quot; with the US public seems like standard operating procedure. I guess &quot;just in case&quot; war broke out, half of the PR is already done. Watching the NBC Nightly news in the US is very similar to watching Russia Today in, well, Russia.",1438961400

Recent college graduate here.<p>Did a lot of hacking for a couple years back in the early 2000s as a kid in PHP, Perl, etc. before losing interest. Recently graduated with an unrelated non-STEM degree, turned down an investment banking job because I didn&#x27;t enjoy it much, and thought of recapturing the excitement of my early hacking days. So I taught myself Rails, etc. and am a dev at a web app startup.<p>And I find it pretty boring. I find that it suits the other devs pretty well as they just genuinely enjoy writing code and scaling backends. Me, I&#x27;m more of a big picture guy, and all I keep thinking is what we&#x27;re doing here has been done hundreds if not thousands of times. I&#x27;m realizing now that I enjoyed my days hacking as a kid because it was all  somewhat new and pretty fucking hard to figure out without all the immense resources at our disposal today.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s possible to recapture this experience, and how. I&#x27;m pretty unmotivated by money at this point, so I would gladly take a paycut to do it. I keep coming across &quot;deep learning&quot; and &quot;CRISPR.&quot; Is this the cutting edge?

Second, even at a classical physics level non-linear systems with very similar starting points can have very different final states.  As a practical matter that means even if the rules are deterministic, you cannot predict with 100% accuracy what the outcome will be.<p>So we have a complex non-linear system (your genes) and a very very complex non-linear system (the environment) that make a very complex non-linear system (your brain).  Because we have all of these complex non-linear system interacting together, we cannot determine what will happen in any practical sense.  We can probably make some observations that will generally hold about some decisions a human brain will make (e.g. it&#x27;s been a few hours, it will be hungry and decide to eat), but these are more probabilistic rather than 100% concrete deterministic rules.<p>0: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem</a>",1438960575

Keep in mind that while your Gemfile lists only three gems (with varying degrees of version strictness), your application depends on dozens of gems, once you take into consideration all of the implicit requirements of the gems you depend on.<p>This is important: the Gemfile.lock makes your application a single package of both your own code and the third-party code it ran the last time you know for sure that everything worked.

While that&#x27;s a little embarrassing to admit, it&#x27;s also typical user behavior. Users don&#x27;t read; they scan. I did what a typical user would do: I scanned the copy and looked for the clicky-bit, and then I clicked it.<p>From there, I&#x27;m presented with a page dominated by two images. I tried to figure out what the hell I&#x27;m supposed to do.<p>Hrm... I see two obvious clicky-bits on this page: Agency and Porn buttons. The image over the Agency button looks pretty agency, and the image over the Porn button looks pretty porny.<p>What the hell am I supposed to discern here? Maybe I&#x27;m supposed to figure out which one is an actual image used by an agency or in a porn film.<p>I click my first answer.<p>Aaaaah geeze.<p>Fortunately, I&#x27;m on my free time and my wife has a sense of humor. She asks me to please close the door while baitin&#x27;.<p>&quot;Fuck this, this isn&#x27;t any fun,&quot; I think. And I close the window.<p>I drop a comment warning other HN users that they&#x27;re going to be porn-audio-bombed by the site and move on.<p>A couple of days later, I notice that I&#x27;ve collected a few karma points and check my profile page to see what sage advice was deemed useful by the HN crowd. Heh, it was just my warning label and a swipe I took at Rob Reinhart that boosted my score.<p>I revisit the agencyorporn.com link, this time prepared for what awaits me.<p>Headphones? Check.<p>Smart kid who always reads directions attitude? Check.<p>Click!<p>Reading...<p>&quot;Guess which of these tantalizing <i>names</i> belong...&quot;<p>Names!? Wait, there&#x27;s text on the pages?<p>I click the Start button for the second time in my life and I see what is clearly a camera and a dildo. Mkay, where&#x27;s the &quot;name&quot;? I start at what I think is the top (the border of the two contrasting colors). Nope.<p>I really take a step back and start at the <i>actual</i> top. Holy shit, there it is. It&#x27;s been staring me in the face the whole time! The text at the very top of the page is what I&#x27;m supposed to evaluate.<p>I try a few and quickly get bored with the concept (sorry). The audio also seems like it&#x27;s leveled to be pretty loud. I&#x27;m kind of put off by the whole experience and I exit.<p>That&#x27;s my experience as a user. As a product guy, my feedback would be this:<p>Users don&#x27;t read.<p>If I&#x27;m supposed to focus on something, please make it the center of focus.<p>Users don&#x27;t read!<p>Use visual hierarchy to communicate importance.<p>On the landing page, what is the most important element? Users are drawn to imagery before text, so the most important element on the screen is the image of the woman to the right. Secondarily, my eye was drawn to the Agency or Porn logo, then the start button. The instructions are the fourth most important thing on the page, visually. It&#x27;s not clear that they are instructions. IMO, they should be labeled as such. The fact that they started with what appears to be a rhetorical question caused me to evaluate the text as a &quot;blurb&quot; (marketing copy), so I ignored it. My mind jumped directly to, &quot;I&#x27;m already sold, give me the game!&quot;<p>In the game interface, the visual hierarchy is out of whack as well. The item I&#x27;m supposed to evaluate is <i>outside</i> the visual grouping of all the game control elements. It looks like a page title, not a game element. Visually, the most important parts of the page are the two giant images. These images communicate (reinforce, really) the function of the buttons for &quot;Agency&quot; or &quot;Porn&quot;. They are supporting elements, not primary elements. The &quot;name&quot; I&#x27;m supposed to evaluate should be the most important item on the screen.",1438960147

All of our devs are having trouble visually locating comments in diffs. We&#x27;re always scrolling through the left-side menu looking for the issues tab. It&#x27;s hard to visually differentiate between items like comments in merge requests. Our eyes just can&#x27;t find and follow things. Even BitBucket looks better.<p>We&#x27;re working hard on this and focus more and more of our development capacity to this.<p>> - GitLab-CI has poor documentation on runners, and a rather buggy test runner registration process that doesn&#x27;t provide any debugging output and produces false positives quite often.<p>There are a lot of improvements coming in this field. Especially the integration and setup of runners is going to be easier. We&#x27;re hoping to make this a zero-step setup thing.\nSame with documentation. Our new GitLab CI maintainer Kamil has been spending a lot of time on writing documentation.<p>> - GitLab-CI has no unconditional cleanup directive, like CircleCI does... but if you&#x27;re re-using a test runner instead of tearing down the server each time, unconditional cleanup is the one thing you need. And no, the Docker executor doesn&#x27;t solve this because we don&#x27;t want to test our Docker containers inside Docker.<p>This is interesting, I&#x27;m passing it onto Kamil.<p>> - CI is based on commit IDs. You can&#x27;t run particular CI events on merge requests. For example, this means no way to run integration tests on merge requests.<p>This is be interesting to look at. I&#x27;m not sure whether we have something like this in the planning, but I&#x27;m taking note.<p>> - Typography could be improved. When you&#x27;re looking at the issues page all day, this is quite noticeable.<p>We&#x27;re worried about adding page load by including typefaces. We might change our minds on this. What OS are you using?\nWould Roboto work, for instance?<p>> - Slack integration is not great; it dumps links to &quot;GitLab Enterprise Edition&quot; instead of useful commit/changeset stuff like GitHub does.<p>We welcome contributions to improve it. This is not a focus at the moment, but considering the popularity of Slack, we can definitely have a look at this.",1438959661

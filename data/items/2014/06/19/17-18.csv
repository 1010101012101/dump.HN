7917380,comment,7915848,7915848,2,0,anon4,,,"I&#x27;m generally a fan of currying, but specifically when used with javascript, I think it can be problematic. The default behaviour of any function when called with fewer arguments than specified is to set named arguments to undefined. Meaning, functions in javascript always take any number of arguments and changing that default behaviour is confusing. There is also the matter of the &quot;this&quot; parameter.<p>I think that using the .bind() method on functions is the right approach. It will lead to less surprising behaviour in the context of javascript.",1403200704

Even a line like, &quot;Under $x/hour.&quot; would be useful.<p>2. The blog post says that the memory and compute types have no disk. This confused me at first, but then I saw on <a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/onmetal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/onmetal/</a> that they have 32GB boot drives. You might want to add that to the comparison table in the blog post.<p>3. Has any thought been given to letting users provision OnMetal servers in specific cabinets? Sometimes users want to have servers next to each other for better network connectivity. Other times, they want them in different cabinets for increased reliability.<p>Lastly, kudos to Rackspace for building this. Most people don&#x27;t realize how virtualization can hurt performance.

At the root of your project type `npm explore foo` and press enter and you&#x27;ll be in a shell exploring the foo module.

Or if you want to go down the rabbit hole to a dependency of foo called bar, type `npm explore bar` and press enter.<p>`npm explore` is a great way to explore things and navigate to the dependencies used by the dependency you want to investigate.

If English is your first language, even better.<p>The problem with getting a job in Sweden, which can be surprisingly hard is because a) worker protection laws are strong, bordering ridiculous. You can literally not fire the worst person on your team and hire someone else. b) salaries are comparably flat with high entry level salaries. Due to strong unions and high taxes on work, minimum wages are high ($10-20 depending on sector) and the minimum cost for hiring  someone could be 50% higher including fees/taxes. This means there are no cheap employees. Together with generous benefit systems, the equilibrium unemployment is high, so there will always be a pool of people speaking Swedish that can take the job you are after. For unskilled immigrants without good English skills, this is a huge obstacle, there are thousands of people that literally cannot &quot;produce&quot; value that matches the cost of employing them. On the positive side, once you <i>have</i> a full time job, you can provide for a family, without working a second job or more than 40h/week.<p>For skilled and/or English speaking immigrants, coming here shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.",1403200302

The email started out mentioning posts of mine on HN (met the first criteria, proof-of-work) and how their company was using that technology, which was effective and hooked me into reading the email and not immediately deleting it; but then went into a paragraph describing their company (didn&#x27;t meet the second, describing what your company does).  It did come from their CEO (so, met the third).  Up to now, not too bad, although it was a little long and so starts to violate the guideline about length.<p>The difference came at the end of the email, where instead of outreaching for me directly, the CEO was looking for my help in filling two engineering positions they have.  It wasn&#x27;t couched as &quot;we&#x27;re interested in you and possibly someone else if you know anyone,&quot; it was &quot;I&#x27;m looking for your help in filling these positions.&quot;  I had a slight negative reaction to this - why should I help you with your recruiting, when I&#x27;m not involved in what you&#x27;re doing?  (I should point out that I&#x27;m not really the target audience for the type of person they&#x27;re looking for, either) I wish this company all the best, but I don&#x27;t feel like I need to help with their recruiting.  I haven&#x27;t replied back to the guy and probably won&#x27;t do anything else with it. (although he&#x27;ll see this post, which I&#x27;m obviously ok with)<p>The other wrinkle was (and this is really minor), in the &#x27;proof-of-work&#x27; section, he mentioned seeing a post of mine about OCaml.  This threw me for a minute, as I haven&#x27;t written anything on HN specifically about OCaml and I&#x27;m not even an OCaml programmer or involved in that community.  Closest I could find was a post I made about type theory, on a story about OCaml, where I said &quot;well, this isn&#x27;t OCaml, but...&quot;  It probably impacted my overall feeling about the cold email in a negative way.<p>edit: I will say that I did get a cold email once from a Google recruiter, and he pretty much followed Stripe&#x27;s guide.  He got a positive response from me, including a good follow-up phone conversation.  I wasn&#x27;t willing to move to California though so that ended things pretty quickly, but I did appreciate the guy&#x27;s effort.",1403200089
7917322,comment,7916961,7916961,10,0,danieldk,,,"The article takes a very weird turn:<p><i>If we need extra information about the words, we can use an additional data structure along with the MA-FSA. We can store it in a hash table.</i><p>This is not necessary at all, since an acyclic finite state automaton can be used as a perfect hash function. If you sum the right language cardinalities of the transitions followed, you get a unique hash code (1..n, where n is the number of strings in the automaton). For efficiency, you can precompute the cardinalities in the transitions or states. You can then use a normal array for whatever data you want to associate with a word.<p>With respect to parts 1 & 2 of the series, one can construct a Levenshtein automaton for a given word in linear time[1]. Such an automaton matches any string within the given edit distance of the word. You can then compute the intersection (language) of the Levenshtein automaton and the dictionary automaton to get all words within the given edit distance.<p>(Another approach would be to make the dictionary a transducer that returns the words within the given edit distance. I tried this once, but the resulting automaton would be too large for realistic dictionaries.)<p>I wrote a Java library for dictionary automata, perfect hash automata, and Levenshtein automata. It also provides immutable Map containers for String keys, that store strings in an automaton and uses a flat array to store values:<p><a href=""https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danieldk/dictomaton</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://csi.ufs.ac.za/resres/files/Schultz.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csi.ufs.ac.za/resres/files/Schultz.pdf</a>",1403200081

One of my friends worked at Xilinx for 15 years and understood this all too well. He felt the leading cause of the problem was that the tools group was a P&L center, they needed to turn a profit in order to exist. They got that profit by charging high prices for the tools and high prices for support. His argument was that &#x27;easier&#x27; tools cut into support revenue. When I&#x27;ve had high level (E-level, but not C-level) discussions with Xilinx and Altera there has been a lot of acknowledgement about the &#x27;difficulty of getting up to speed&#x27; on the tool chain and many free hours of consulting are offered. From a business engagement point of view, making hard to use tools and then &quot;giving away&quot; thousands of dollars of free consulting to the customer to gain their support seems to work well. The customer feels supported, and stops wondering why if the have consultants around for free those consultants wouldn&#x27;t just make the tools more straight forward to use and available on a wider variety of platforms.<p>But the biggest thing has always been intellectual property. You buy an STM32F4 and it has an Ethernet Mac on it (using Synopsis IP as evidenced by the note in the documentation), you pay $8 for the microprocessor, work around the bugs, and get it running. If you buy an FPGA, lets say a Spartan 3E, you pay $18 for the chip, and if you want to use that Synopsis Ethernet MAC?[1] $25,000 for the HDL source to add to our project $10,000 if you are ok with just the EDIF output which can be fed into a place-and-route back end.

7917251,comment,7915793,7915793,13,0,malandrew,,,"The biggest question mark in this whole thing is how they are going to raise the level of discourse around articles via smart moderation features. News sites are often a race to the bottom in terms of comment quality where all the trolls kill off any meaningful discourse.<p>A while ago when this very problem for news sites was discussed on an HN thread, someone posted a pertinent question &quot;Why should the discussion of an article occur in the same place as the article itself?&quot;. The point that person was making is that all the aggregator sites like HN and Reddit for example, have done a good job providing a forum for commenting on content posted elsewhere (like the NYTimes and WaPo). With that in mind, how would one turn this splintering into manageable communities into a feature. There needs to be a way where there is automatic segmenting based on quality of commentary. Maybe like a Major leagues, minor leagues and troll leagues, where there are two or three simultaneous threads going on. People who&#x27;ve never commented before and have no karma end up in the minor leagues by default. If they get upvoted enough their, their comments go to the major leagues. Likewise, if their comments get downvoted enough it ends up in the troll leagues, where the trolls can quibble among one another.<p>The hardest part is going to be establishing a culture that reinforces high quality content like here on HN. I can&#x27;t even begin to see how you build something like that overnight. It takes weeks to months of slow stable growth with really good people to establish a high quality commentary culture that is self policing without using their moderation powers for censorship. I have no earthly idea how you create a feature that promotes the same in a community where hundreds to thousands of commenters are going to show up on day one. Maybe you could launch the comment system as a private beta feature where entry into the private beta is based on posting a really high quality comment and that good enough comments get inducted into the thread so that current private beta people can comment. Once you&#x27;ve posted enough such high quality comments, you get general access to participate. Then, like on HN, you eventually earn the right to upvote comments and one day, with enough points, the right to downvote comments.",1403199196

If someone&#x27;s gone to the effort of looking into my work in detail I&#x27;ll normally repay the kindness by replying.<p>Case in point, a few months ago Udacity sent me an e-mail which went in some detail about a blog post I&#x27;d written, some of my Stack Overflow answers...it was pretty clear the person writing had actually taken the time to <i>read</i> some of my stuff, so even though I wasn&#x27;t looking at the time I wrote back to thank them.<p>As other people have pointed out, this also works the other way round.

7917122,comment,7916160,7916979,9,0,gbhn,,,"I have a tangentially related question: has there been any thought given to raising patent validity standards around teachability? A big constitutional point of a patent is to teach someone &quot;skilled in the art&quot; how to replicated the subject matter of the patent. That&#x27;s typically intepreted as &quot;can you pay an expert witness to claim the patent teaches them to construct the claimed infringement,&quot; which is, of course, always true. But to me, this seems like fertile ground for the defense, and ought to be a negative test: can the defense find an expert witness to say that the patent is too vague, unspecific, or abstract to teach them to construct the claimed infringement.<p>Is this approach ever tried in these cases? It seems to me that the more convoluted and abstract the patent (which seems to be the point of many of these patents explicitly written to try and reach as broad as possible), the more juries will tend to identify with the expert saying &quot;I can&#x27;t  make heads or tails of this thing&quot; and invalidate bad patents as simply failing to adequately teach the construction of the infringement claim.",1403197481

Of course, there have to be <i>far</i> more edge cases to handle all this tuple twiddling.<p>---<p>Really, I think it&#x27;s pretty meaningful to blur the distinction between &quot;curry (once)&quot; and &quot;curry repeatedly along with tuple reassociation&quot;.

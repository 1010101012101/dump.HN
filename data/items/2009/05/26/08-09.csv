626435,comment,626092,626092,0,0,patio11,,,"Something just warms the cockles of my blackened geeky heart to see that.  Its... tactile?  Like the Japanese commuter trains, which run on a accurate-to-15-seconds schedule that drives one of the world's biggest economies and has catastrophic consequences for failure.<p>So are the trains kept in sync with the schedule by their onboard computers or radio signals from an atomic clock or NTP servers over wireless?  No.  They are actually kept in sync by <i>windable gold clockwork watches</i>, which each conductor keeps with him and places in a special gold clockwork watchholder on the dashboard of his modern technological marvel.<p>Its partially for historical reasons and partially for aesthetic sensibilities, although I know at least one Japanese railroad engineer who says it is a safety feature.  I think that is largely a justification so that he doesn't have to say ""We sync the trains with gold clockwork watches because we wanted to sync the trains with gold clockwork watches, as trains were meant to be synced!""",1243327364

I find it unbelievable that so many people haven't figured this out yet. If you can't stand being disconnected for the length of the film then watch it at home.",1243327110

I find the two cities nothing alike and off the top of my head could think of about 40 more salient differences. The most salient being: in one of those cities everyone speaks French, and the other one... they do not.",1243326547

There SHOULD be privacy controls.<p>I was only disagreeing with the OP that all contact information should be ""not required"" at all.<p>My take is: Yes, collect the contact information (and as much as feasible, ensure it is valid) but also provide options to make it private to an extent (perhaps have at least one public email (protected from spam bots obviously) while making the rest of the info private and available only through a court order etc)<p>As you can see, I also have extreme parentheses usage syndrome ;)",1243326147

626417,comment,626380,626380,0,0,thristian,,,"I watched this video a week or so ago (it was linked in a Tell Me Which Google Tech Talks Are Good To Watch thread) and I was impressed at how well-reasoned his points were, how poorly Java has lived up to them since 1998 when the talk was recorded (still no operator overloading!) and how many subsequent languages have followed his guidelines for growth, either deliberately or as parallel evolution.<p>For example, although Python's syntax isn't extensible to the extent that Scheme or Lisp are, Python's Decimal class is still fairly transparently interoperable with built-in numeric classes. Other parts of the interpreter, such as object instances, classes and modules are built out of exactly the same dict objects that normal scripts use, which makes it easy to build new language features that feel like part of the base language.",1243325925

The Mayo Clinic is the best managed medical institution in the country.  There are books written about it's management (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Management-Lessons-Mayo-Clinic-Organizations/dp/0071590730/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1243324775&sr=8-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Management-Lessons-Mayo-Clinic-Organiz...</a>).

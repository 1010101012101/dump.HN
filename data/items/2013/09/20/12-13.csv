Dispensing charity on the local level, rather than the federal, reduces fraud and gets the funds directly in the hands that need it most. And there is a lot of fraud in the food stamp program.<p>2. One of the biggest problems the US is facing currently is the inability to pay for entitlement programs. The federal government is borrowing furiously to cover these programs. Unless they get a handle on things, after enough borrowing, the dollar will simply collapse. The poor will be hardest hit by this.<p>3. Food stamps are essentially cash. Even when spent properly, they&#x27;re usually spent on processed poor quality food because that&#x27;s the cheapest stuff around. Take the funds and spend them at soup kitchens that can leverage their purchasing power and buy high quality fresh food at a discount.<p>4. Any entitlement programs reduces the incentive to work and become self-sufficient. As much as this makes you cringe, it is true nevertheless.<p>5. Having been on food stamps myself, I can tell you right off the bat, it&#x27;s absolutely degrading. At the time, they didn&#x27;t use any kind of cards, you had actual food stamps. There you are, paying with stamps, while everybody else pays with cash. It&#x27;s like wearing a sign saying &quot;look at me, I&#x27;m poor!&quot; and it&#x27;s humiliating. A more discrete way of distributing help would be far more humane.<p>How about a discussion, rather than this echo chamber?",1379681159

If you criticize someone, then in fact you exhibit the trait of <i>criticizing</i>. But you&#x27;ll notice I didn&#x27;t use the term &quot;criticizer&quot;, so it&#x27;s a moot point.<p>> What does fault even mean?<p>In the context of what I wrote, it was not the author who caused the nastiness. He went to a park with a typewriter. People made horrible comments about him. Many people said they hated him.

Not sure how to spell it out more clearly.<p>As someone else has already pointed out, your examples aren&#x27;t relevant to this article.

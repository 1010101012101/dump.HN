Trevor Eckhart claimed CIQ was a ""rootkit"", and they freaked out and threatened to sue him.<p>Naturally, everyone now assumes that CarrierIQ is evil, since suing security researchers is almost invariably an evil thing to do.<p>People are paying less attention to the fact that CarrierIQ subsequently issued a <i>formal apology</i> to Trevor (from experience: companies stung by security researchers virtually never do this; they just back off quietly), and that nobody has really refuted CIQ's claims about what their software does.<p>The ""there's this evil big brother company nobody has ever heard of that a security researcher found out and got sued over"" narrative is a lot more fun than the banal reality, so that's what we're all going to run with.<p>It's also a little amusing to see people wigging out over the privacy of their SMS messages. Their SMS messages have no privacy. The carriers see and log <i>all</i> of them. Lord only knows what other tools they have on their network explicitly for the purpose of mining data out of those messages.",1322794737

Indeed, historically, monopolies seem to have required government intervention to be dismantled (Standard Oil, AT&T, etc), though perhaps that's simply defining monopolies as those entities that the government dismantled as such.<p>Regardless, I think this is one of the two “silver bullet”-style myths that likes to float around the area of government regulation: one, that less regulation is always better, the other, that more regulation is always better.

First off, this reads like an editorial. We want facts, not spin and their extremely biased writing takes their credibility from wherever it is to far lower now. Orwell's World? Maybe. But let me decide that and don't try to plant the idea. I think an organization that would spin this as anti-government propaganda is just as bad as the some of the things they're opposed to. Give me facts and let me decided - don't throw in opinions to guide me to the ""correct"" view.<p>2. I couldn't read every brochure nor do I want to but the brochures and videos I saw weren't all that evil. At least not as evil as they want me to believe. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be spied on and I do see the potential for abuse but the brochures here are things I can get by myself. The HP brochure, the Hacker Team video, and others aren't hiding in some dark government lab. They're out there trying to sell this stuff to the right people! I don't come across it because I have no need for it nor am I interested in it. But anyway, they're pretty quiet about selling this stuff but they do know how to get heard by the right people. That doesn't mean it's a secret. They don't make secret brochures for spy products if their products and services are supposed to be considered sensitive information like wiki leaks wants us to believe.<p>3. Don't we all know about this? It really isn't a secret anymore that there are companies creating software and hardware specifically meant to take over devices and spy on people. We hope it doesn't happen to us but we know it sometimes does. That sucks. We should know. We should make a fuss and we do. But wiki leaks isn't sharing anything groundbreaking here. We all know about Carrier IQ, right? Maybe CarrierIQ is a little more benign but then we also know about the cyber attack on Iranian nuclear program via Stuxnet so we all know it goes on, already know the abuse potential, and already know about some but not all abuses. Nothing earth shattering again.<p>4. This could have come off as a jumping off point for discussing the seriousness of the problem in terms of how we can spot and stop the general public from being spied on but instead they just created tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist fodder. I know it did spark some constructive discussion but I'll be damned if it didn't sound like the stuff you can find on anti GWB sites or ""Obama is a member of the Skull and Bones, hey look at the secret symbols on a dollar bill"" type sites.<p>Also, I want to see The sources for where they got the information on these spy products being used in Egypt and Lybia. If its there then it's hard to find. And the site needs a better layout. Nothing fancy, just make it easier to navigate and read.<p>I think WikiLeaks took what could have been a great jumping off point for debate and made it into a joke with their very generous helping of spin and what seems to be an antiestablishment agenda just for the sake of having an antiestablishment agenda.",1322791469

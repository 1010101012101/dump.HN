I personally have a thing for beautiful hardware and industrial design. Apple fits that bill but there are lots of other companies that have done some brilliant hardware design that stand out.

We ran through those until we had a short list of names we liked.  Of course most addresses were taken, but we didn't stop there, we made the effort to contact the current owners. Which required a /whois + some creative googling.<p>We actually found one owner who said he might be willing to sell it, but he didn't have a clue how to transfer it or even price it.  We walked him through the process and he even offered it to us at a fraction of the assessed value because he said, ""that price was just too much!""<p>We were thrilled when we landed <a href=""http://realphotography.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realphotography.com</a>",1204573983

It would need approval from people not familiar with OSS.\nMay be the model is to do it, thru consulting. For example, start working in Ruport, then advertise your self as a Ruport consultant, find some customers that are willing to pay for support or consulting, as you are able to charge for it, you can spend more time working in the project. I think several people have been able to do it. Companies are used to pay for support or consulting, they are not used to pay for something that is already free.<p>Some companies have been able to do it with great success. SpringOne, JBoss, JGoodies come to my mind.",1204573354

In general, processes with known static completion conditions and stable progress are not good candidates â€“ standard progress bars can visualize these effectively and accurately.

""Real"" optimization is useless if it doesn't optimize the practical uses of the system.  After all, computers are <i>tools</i>.  Objective optimization doesn't make them better tools, since it doesn't make them any more effective when they're being used by people.  Perceived optimization, on the other hand, allows people to better use their computer.<p>As the maxim goes: ""Use better tools.""

128231,comment,126982,126982,0,0,phaedrus,,,"The article has a pretty good explanation of night owls vs. morning people, namely that the real reason people are one or the other is not the time of day they prefer, but that the night owl has a circadian rhythm that is longer than a 24 hour day, so they get out of sync and go to bed later and later until it bumps against the time they have to get up for work!  Reading that is a personal vindication for me because I've said for years, and no one would believe me, that I run on a 28 hour rhythm.  When I have no other commitments (like during the summer when I was still in high school) my sleep schedule would wrap around and around the clock.  I believe I have an unusually long circadian rhythm compared to the norm, so going to bed at the same time just doesn't work for me; what actually happens is that throughout the week I get progressively less sleep until I crash and sleep all day, resetting the cycle.",1204571509

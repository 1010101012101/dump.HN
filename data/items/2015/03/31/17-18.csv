9298484,comment,9295606,9298204,0,0,exelius,,,"This is the difference between macroeconomics and microeconomics. Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole using a set of very broad principles, while microeconomics looks at smaller segments with their own domain-specific rules.<p>Education: There is an artificial restriction on the number of &quot;good&quot; universities. As demand for Ivy League schools increases, supply does not, so people are willing to pay more and more for it. It takes many years to build up a school&#x27;s reputation. Also, the US Government guarantees student loans, so while the financial system would normally correct this by appropriately incorporating risk when issuing loans to students attending sub-par schools, they do not in this case. But some pull-back is happening; specifically with law schools.<p>Housing: This is a relatively recent issue, but essentially it&#x27;s the same thing as education: there are only so many &quot;desirable&quot; places to live, but an increasing demand for them. The supply of housing in popular areas can&#x27;t increase as quickly as demand; it can take a decade or more just to acquire the land to build a dense multi-family structure on top of a block of row homes. The bay area also has a lot of problems in that it tries to protect existing communities by making it pretty difficult to build anything, which ultimately just drives up the price of housing. NYC has other issues because globally, wealthy people see it as a status symbol to have an apartment in Manhattan and London. They buy it as an investment and often don&#x27;t use it, but this prices out people who live in the area.<p>Health Care: This is a whole other subject; pricing in health care is largely NOT driven by supply and demand. It&#x27;s closer to extortion; if I tell you that you&#x27;re going to die or be disabled unless you pay me $50,000; you&#x27;re going to pay me. Congress has shown little appetite to actually fix the problem: there are too many middlemen with opaque pricing, and consumers will pay whatever they have to when it comes to their health. Prices will continue to rise until people start to demand action.",1427824574

A big chunk of the cost &quot;increase&quot; can be attributed to actually paying the cost of externalities (i.e. the costs of coal-burning to others is not reflected in the price).<p>You are right though, it does make the claim that &quot;energy prices are going relentlessly hard&quot; odd without further context; presumably he was talking about a more apples-to-apples comparison of how each type of energy is dropping in price (oil prices dropping, renewables getting cheaper), but that the mix is shifting towards types of energy that are more expensive (and have less externalities) so _residential_ energy prices reflect more of the cost.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-power-prices-20140426-story.html#page=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-power-prices-20140426-st...</a>",1427824538

But you do have a point.<p>There&#x27;s a washing detergent I usually buy because it tends to be cheap and does the job well. But this weekend in my local supermarket it seemed more expensive than usual and another similar one was on sale. I figured I&#x27;d take a look - turns out they&#x27;re both owned by procter&gamble, their ingredients are identical and they claim to do exactly the same thing with the same amount of liquid. My assumption is they&#x27;re bottled from the same vat, they&#x27;re certainly interchangeable for me.<p>I&#x27;m not saying go analyse every product on the shelves instead of just picking up whatever, but if you&#x27;re not in a rush it&#x27;s worth checking special offers if they&#x27;re really similar to what you were going to buy.<p>And it&#x27;s definitely worth being aware of the megacorporations that own the brands on the supermarket shelves - most of the well known brands are owned by a few umbrella organisations and not really competing at a high level.<p>I doubt this is a surprise to anyone, but as a couple of examples PG [0] own BOSS Black, Christina Aguilera, Hugo and Old Spice fragrances; as well as Bold, Daz, Fairy, Flash and Lenor detergents.

I&#x27;ve been in both categories and although I&#x27;ve only been in the game for a few years, I&#x27;ve learned the pitfalls of the &quot;fresh grad&quot; approach.<p>The author is right in considering sales &quot;Mission Critical&quot; for startups and other small businesses looking to grow and then goes on to explain the various ways in which an open or ineffective sales position will damage the position of the company. Despite that display of wisdom, they advocate a &quot;fresh grad&quot; approach which is just about the fastest way to ensure high turnover and low productivity. Every salesperson has to start somewhere and a fresh graduate with a sales personality and love for the job often be the best kind of salesperson for this kind of role for the reasons stated by the author. The problem is that candidates can&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll like the world of sales until they&#x27;ve lived in it. Even if they have an amazing ability to filter out applicants without &quot;the right stuff&quot;, they&#x27;ll still end up with a high % of new reps that just don&#x27;t like the responsibilities of their role.<p>That can manifest itself in a lack of interest for the industry (boy did I hate copiers, talk about a dead-end market), a lack of interest in the product (some people love sales but hate selling intangibles like services), a mismatch in the selling style required by the market (relationship vs. technical), or a preference for stable income (depends on compensation structure but sales can be very feast or famine).<p>The company I work for now faced this issue and we&#x27;ve had incredible success stemming from the switch to the strategy of hiring young reps with a few years of experience. We&#x27;re all &quot;fresh&quot; enough to go after new business with enthusiasm but we were also a known quantity in that we had all proven that we would stick it out in sales. Prior to this switch, we had 50% turnover for all the reasons stated above (some reps wanted to sell tangible products, others wanted a relationship sales style, others wanted a guaranteed salary, and other realized marketing or operations was a better fit for their personality) but none of the &quot;new group&quot; has left in the past 12 months and I doubt anyone will for a while.<p>The post-2008 stagnation has created climate with a lot of talented reps stuck near the bottom of the ladder. Offer them the next rung or an honest path toward advancement and they&#x27;ll jump over in a heartbeat. Let the churn n&#x27; burn companies (ADP, Cintas, office equipment dealers/manufacturers) do the hard work of weeding out the fresh grads that won&#x27;t cut it or don&#x27;t want in. You avoid the biggest risks and although you&#x27;ll have to pay more, you&#x27;ll be more confident that you&#x27;re getting value out of that &quot;Mission Critical&quot; sales position.",1427823485

However, if they successfully inflate away some significant percentage of the value of the USD, the nominal debt remains the same but it becomes lighter in real terms.<p>Pippa Malmgren - correctly, I think - describes this inflating away the value of the currency (and by extension, all outstanding debts) as just another form of default, and one that has been used many times in history.  It&#x27;s just more stealthy than saying &quot;we can&#x27;t pay, so we won&#x27;t pay&quot; or something similar[0].<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBU59sY2erA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBU59sY2erA</a>",1427823450

We&#x27;ve always talked about the wavefunction collapsing but never been able to describe the onotology of collapse. Non-locality seemed for a time to explain why that is so: because collapse happened non-locally, it could happily violate the law of non-contradiction from the viewpoint of a Lorentz-invariant observer.<p>The alternative to collapse is decoherence due to entanglement with a heat bath. There are still unexplained issues with this, in my view, but that may simply be because I don&#x27;t fully understand how the ontology of the classical world is constructed by this process, or why once that ontology is constructed the beings that are governed by its laws are only capable of being aware of the foundations via the most indirect kind of inference.<p>In any case, this experiment shows some of the power of &quot;entanglement&quot; vs &quot;collapse&quot; as an account of measurement. If &quot;collapse&quot; is a short-hand for measurements that involve &quot;entanglement with a heat bath&quot; then it is possible perform a measurement that involves entangling part of a wavefunction with a coherent signal (the local oscillator in a homodyne detector) without doing to it what we would call &quot;collapse&quot;.

(Chrome isn&#x27;t one of them, despite its mention in these posts -- since Chrome 37 it has done proper DPI scaling on Windows, and that release has been out for quite a while now).<p>Photoshop (since it was also mentioned) has very limited support for real scaling (beyond the OS&#x27;s default of render as if on a low-dpi screen and then bitmap scale the UI up, which looks horrible, especially when combined with an app you are using to do precise bitmap editing) -- the only meaningful option it gives you is to scale everything in the UI up 200%, which is better than nothing (and what I have to do on my 3840x2160 Toshiba laptop to get a usable UI), but not a really flexible solution and even this is considered an &quot;expirmental feature&quot; in the very latest version.<p>Adobe Lightroom, on the other hand, has effortless scaling and just works great on screens at any DPI.<p>The point being there is plenty of support in the OS for apps that effectively scale, it is just that there are a lot of Win32 legacy apps out there which would require a near rewrite of the UI layer to scale well, it is by no means something the OS handles for you automatically (beyond the clumsy bitmap scaling default) if your code targets the older UI APIs, and there are (still) plenty of gotchas you do actually run into when running Windows apps on high DPI screens, though things are certainly improving in this regard.",1427823284

I think the core idea is actually pretty good- a seamless way to remember to get stuff you need at the time you realize you need it. One of the major pain points for shoppers is keeping track of all the crap you need at the time you are at the store. If you could continuously add to the list and then the grocery stores had some kind of integration with their loyalty program so it knew when you had purchased what was on your list and automatically removed it, that would be a huge time-saver. Even if it just synced to a todo list, that would be really nice.<p>However, there are two things that I think would prevent this from becoming a game-changer for Amazon. First, most shoppers are extraordinarily price-sensitive when it comes to household goods. Wal-Mart is a $270 billion company precisely because of this. Most people like to comparison shop based largely on price. If the concept of price is completely hidden from view until after the purchase is made, you are trading transparency for ease-of-use. There is certainly a market for this, but not the largest share of it.<p>Second, as long as there are other things that shoppers have to get at the grocery (namely, groceries), I believe that most will opt to wait until they go next time since they have to go anyway. This product doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of instant-gratification and having the product at the time you need it, it just makes it a little easier to order it when you need it.",1427823153

That is -- the things that real people actually need!  I don&#x27;t care about the cost of cell phones and TVs and so forth.  Or even gas (for me).  Those are a drop in the bucket.<p>Education: I graduated in 2001 from an Ivy League university.  It cost $32K a year as far as I remember.  The same thing costs $50K or so now?  That&#x27;s a pretty astounding increase in such a short time.<p>Housing: Obviously situations are different throughout the country, but in the wealthier areas like NYC and the Bay Area housing prices seems out of control.  I feel like housing prices aren&#x27;t falling in the US in general besides economically distressed places like Detroit, but I could be wrong.<p>Health care: Costs also seem to be rising quickly, but admittedly that is probably because health care is generally much better than it was 50 years ago and people will pay anything to survive, and they are surviving in greater rates (e.g. compare Iraq veterans to veterans of previous wars.)<p>Sure all of these are just anecdotes.

9298185,comment,9296617,9297568,0,0,btreecat,,,"Well we never were a Java shop, and we already had a lot of python in play so awkwardly enough I settled on web2py for the time being. We happen to have some legacy code that is just easier to incorporate than rewrite which did lead to some of the initial decisions to use groovy/grails.<p>Some other devs had taken Django on a tour back in it&#x27;s 1.1-1.2 days and hated it so I was pushed to look at something else. Did not care for Pyramid and didn&#x27;t have the time to &quot;do it all&quot; with flask so I settled on web2py.<p>Turns out to have been a great choice for us so far. The framework is still bloated by comparison, so I don&#x27;t like it when what we should be building is really an API.<p>However not having a plugin dictate what version of jQuery I am using has been a boon for fronted productivity.<p>To more directly address my issue with the plugin system, another commenter said it well &quot;With Grails by comparison you&#x27;re more likely to find plugins that haven&#x27;t been updated in years and be constantly fighting dependency conflicts. At least that was my experience.&quot;<p>This mirrors my exact experience on several projects I started and maintained. I just assumed it was because I didn&#x27;t know how to use grail well. Then I inherited a medium sized code base from some developers who were born and bread java EE devs and _love_ groovy and grails and seemed to always know the &quot;right way.&quot;<p>Only problem was, once I started following the code, it was all just java in groovy syntax and just as crusty and hard to update to new versions.<p>I eventually gave up following groovy releases and just froze all my projects on the 2.3.x line. I was spending more time every week upgrading plugins and fixing issues that never existed before upgrade (like broken JSON and XML parsing).<p>When it comes to an ORM, I often just try to avoid it unless I am dealing with an application that has data that I know will be very regular and work well as a spread sheet in a simpler context. Anything more complex and I just research it online or start poking my DBA&#x27;s for proper design/access patterns. This again leads me to why I like web2py, the DAL is very similar to SQLAlchemy&#x27;s core design. Just a simple abstraction layer for generating queries and maintaining connections/pooling.<p>We have talked about vert.x, and it seems promising. My reservation is that I am still not a fan of groovy, Jython is not version 2.7 yet, and I don&#x27;t know scala or want the verbosity of java. So it just is not my first choice although certainly seems promising.<p>I am tinkering with flask as well. I don&#x27;t mind the more DIY approach but having to stitch _so many_ things together just for basic functionality makes me glad I am keeping it for my pluggable API idea which hopefully will replace the DB calls in all our grails applications with API calls to the flask app. But that is another story.<p>TL;DR<p>Have yet to settle on a single replacement although web2py is serving nicely at the time being. Our primary concerns are ease of maintenance and number of DB drivers supported which is why Java/groovy based framework seemed to make sense at the time but python based framework and tools make more sense now.<p>Additionally, Node JS DB support is still pretty iffy, No one here likes using PHP or want&#x27;s to deploy more of it than they have to, Scala is out because Groovy, C# is already used else where but not the best fit for our web-apps and automation, no one here knows more Ruby than what is required to write Puppet modules, Go isn&#x27;t bad but can&#x27;t be used to build a pluggable system AFAIK, one one person knows Perl.",1427822778

People equidistant from that location can communicate instantaneously. Alice modulates the wave function collapse by either taking a measurement or not. Say measuring indicates a 1 and non-measurement indicates a 0. Bob over at the other end uses his ability to distinguish a collapsed wave function from a non-collapsed one to get 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s out the other end. Because the measurement induced wave function collapse is instantaneous this will be faster than light communication. Bob can tell weather Alice is measuring or not, right now.<p>I stand by my assertion that physicists can not tell the difference. I&#x27;ll also add that the reason is that there is no difference.

There is a bit of a description of it here that might be useful: <a href=""http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2012-5/articlesu3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2012-5/arti...</a> That said, this is my take, which is mostly me trying to wrap my head around the problem, so take it all with a grain of salt.<p>The idea is that Alice mixes the (weak) signal photon stream in her lab with a (strong) &quot;local oscillator&quot; of the same frequency (that is the &quot;homo&quot; in &quot;homodyne&quot;) and uses the interference between them to perform measurements on the signal without doing photon counting on it, which when combined with Bob&#x27;s measurements on the other part of the signal photon wavefunction can demonstrate non-local effects. It is important, as always in &quot;spooky-actions-at-a-distance&quot; experiments to emphasize that nothing Bob sees can be used to infer what Alice measures or vice versa: there is no possibility of faster-than-light communication, and it is only when the measurements are combined after the fact that the non-locality becomes manifest.<p>Homodyne measurement seems to be the key thing that makes measurements on single photons possible, and this may be one of those cases where the notion of &quot;collapse&quot; breaks down in favour of &quot;entanglement&quot;: the part of the signal wavefunction in Alice&#x27;s detector doesn&#x27;t collapse, it just gets entangled with the local oscillator, and because everything is still coherent her results can still be combined with results from the wave function components in Bob&#x27;s lab. Entanglement with a heat bath emulates collapse; entanglement with a coherent local oscillator does not. [I&#x27;m still agnostic on the claim &quot;entanglement solves the measurement problem&quot; because I don&#x27;t think it properly answers the question &quot;why is there a classical world at all?&quot;, but that may be just me.]<p>There are a number of loopholes in previous experiments that this closes. I&#x27;m pretty sure it closes all detection efficiency loopholes, and there is a subtle critique of Aspect&#x27;s experiments regarding the timing of the two-photon cascade that this makes irrelevant. There is a small (and in my view fairly implausible) literature on timing and photon-pair-identification issues that goes after two-photon experiments, and this work is not subject to any of these criticisms. I&#x27;m not sure how Joy Christian&#x27;s work on Clifford algebras would be applied to this experiment either, although I expect they will have something to say about it.",1427822121

To date, this process includes a wage increase in the form of a &quot;raise&quot;.

To change this, the compensation system would need to be changed or employment severely reduced.<p>2) Central Banks: Most central bankers will use all their tools (in the form of monetary fiscal policy) to prevent long-term deflation.

These are tests that you know are supposed to pass, but which serve to double-check the assumptions in the code. (I use coverage testing to make sure that blue tests actually run; otherwise it&#x27;s possible in some languages for a test to be shadowed by another test with the same name.)<p>Neither the original Martin implementation nor this one spend time analyzing the code for failure cases. For example, this function takes an i64, but the only justification is &#x27;I do indeed want the function to take 1 integer parameter&#x27;. If the input were 2^63-25 then it would take a very long time to very that it&#x27;s a prime number.<p>In this case, but also with Martin&#x27;s original case, the worst-case time is O(N):<p><pre><code>    while num != 1 {\n        for i in 2..num + 1 {\n            if num % i == 0 {\n                result.push(i);\n                num = num / i;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n</code></pre>\n(Also, I think there&#x27;s an overflow if &#x27;num&#x27; is at the maximum value for i64.)<p>The temptation should not be to assume you know what you are doing. The first step should have been to better quantify the input range. Otherwise, why choose an i64 instead of an i32 or even i8? Why not put a hard limit of, say, 1 million?<p>One hand-wavy answer is to say that the solution given is good enough. The problem is, this means that TDD doesn&#x27;t have a mechanism for identifying and resolving ambiguities in the spec. Either they have to be identified before hand (&quot;big design up front&quot;) or afterwards and entail possible code changes (&quot;test-last design&quot;).<p>Another is to argue that no one expects prime factorization to be fast.

Prime factorization algorithms are well understood:<p><pre><code>    # pyecm from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyecm/\n    #  via http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23708035/most-efficient-way-to-find-all-factors-with-gmpy2-or-gmp\n    >>> import time\n    >>> if 1:\n    ...   t1 = time.time()\n    ...   print(list(pyecm.factors(2**63-25, False, True, 10, 1)))\n    ...   t2 = time.time()\n    ...   print(t2-t1)\n    ... \n    [mpz(9223372036854775783)]\n    0.00698018074036\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s certainly hard to get that performance, but you should know your limitations, not ignore them.<p>I have reviewed a half-dozen prime kata implementations.

Debt can&#x27;t increase faster than the economy indefinitely because it becomes impossible to pay back. But it had been increasing in that fashion for quite some time before the financial crisis. We&#x27;re now living in a world where debt isn&#x27;t growing at those fast rates, and central banks have been trying to keep the economy going without it.<p>Central banks have kept the economy going by buying low-risk assets with new money, which makes the value of assets in general go up. They&#x27;ve also set interest rates to zero, which makes it attractive to borrow money. Asset holders feel richer and spend more money than they would otherwise. Investment opportunities become more attractive because it&#x27;s cheaper to borrow money to take advantage of those opportunities. We get economic growth. These were reasonable actions for our central banks to take.<p>But eventually, the actions of our central banks will need to be reversed. Low interest rates and quantitative easing in perpetuity will eventually cause inflation when the economy gets healthier, or asset prices will get too high for people to continue to expect future gains. This is why the Fed is planning on raising interest rates this year. The problem is that raising interest rates will cause people to stop expecting higher asset prices as well, and they will sell.<p>Deflation in the long run is something to worry about, but it&#x27;s strange for me to hear long term worries when we have more serious short term worries. How do you stop our extraordinary monetary policies without dramatically popping the asset bubble and causing the problems that our policies have been avoiding for six years?",1427821907

The blimp itself was neutrally buoyant and had four wing-like rotors with propellers at the end; the whole unit spun slowly.

They were out field testing it, which is why we stopped by and chatted for a couple hours (yes, I am the son of engineers).<p>Picture a cross between a blimp and a Triebflügeljäger.<p>I heard they went out of business before getting it into production and I can&#x27;t seem to find any relevant information on Google.

I can&#x27;t tell you what brand of paper towels I normally buy, but if I always bought them through my &quot;Bounty&quot; button, I would always buy Bounty paper towels instead of whatever is on sale at the store.<p>I doubt this button connects to Wi-Fi directly - that&#x27;s too much hassle (and too power-hungry).

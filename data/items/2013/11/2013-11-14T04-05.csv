6730578,comment,6727395,6730307,2,0,001sky,,,"This is a great point, and for advertisers it seems absolutely correct. In part because the purpose of the use and her mindset and the advertisers are in synch. Perhaps somewhat similar is linkedin (now worth ~$20B). FB, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter have emerged to be far more disruptive socially as communications platforms. This puts advertsing and the user experience at something of a conflict in terms of functionality (& ignoring here the privacy/data collection debate, which is a different issue). So the reason snapchat is &#x27;hot&#x27; right now to FB and VCs is this disruptive potential to entities with deep pockets.<p>What is interesting, IMHO, is to see if the network effect is really critical, or if the service can be repicated by a thrid party. What I think we will see soon is that people will maintain a network on one site and not necessarily use it; they will turn to other platforms to communicate on an ad-hoc basis. The ad-hoc platforms will have significant value, but wheras instagram and twitter were additional platforms for audience aggregation, the next wave will be service layers where you communicate to your network by &quot;porting over&quot; your contact base, as needed. The only reason I&#x27;m bothering to ramble on is that I&#x27;m not sure FB wins the game buy buying out SnapChat. That worked for instagram, which had a sticky network and people didn&#x27;t leave it. For SnapChat, the whole premise is LNT...so why feel stuck to it? Once FB owns it they will track the hell out of everyone using it, so the LNT value prop dies. But the demand will surely remain if the service can be cloned.",1384404327

If the current rates reached their ultimate conclusion, the power companies would have to make massive, massive investments in storage systems capable of buffering months worth of demand, as their net revenues trend towards $0.",1384404302

6730571,comment,6726433,6726433,1,0,graycat,,,"The actual sense of the title of this
thread is just not true.  My experience
is that plenty of information technology (IT)
VCs are plenty eager to talk seriously
without any introduction except an e-mail
from a startup founder.<p>What I learned, to my great surprise, is
that apparently the VCs are under some quite
severe constraints.  So, they are forced,
from whatever, to ignore essentially everything
about a project I learned doing projects 
in business, academic research, and for the
US DoD.<p>Instead, for an IT project they
want to see, as about the second thing,
some running software.  That there might be
a lot of crucial work before such software,
work that makes the software itself trivial,
just is not in their experience and is nearly
always way beyond their nearly always
rather meager technical backgrounds.<p>So, for the
running software, they want to &quot;play with it&quot;,
likely essentially to look at the user interface
(UI) and estimate how well many users will like it.<p>For more, they want to see some forms of
&#x27;traction&#x27; which apparently they use as a
surrogate for accounting data traditional in
commercial bank lending or private equity
investing.<p>For a deeper look, they like simplistic
&#x27;patterns&#x27; based on past history
of IT VC taken fairly narrowly.
So,
they have a fundamental problem seeing
or evaluating something that is really
new, even if, say, the US DoD problem
sponsors could see the power and value.<p>So, I have a list of 40+ VCs eager to
&quot;play with&quot; my software when it goes live.
I got an introduction to none of them and
for each of them just sent e-mail.  They
responded with e-mail and at least one
phone conversation.  They are impressed
enough with the &#x27;market&#x27;, the &#x27;technology&#x27;
to the (meager) extent they and 
value it, and the goals.  Then they just
want to see it working, hopefully also
with &#x27;traction&#x27;.  How much?  One VC
firm said 100,000 unique users a month.
With my site that might be $12,800
a month in revenue at which time,
with my low &#x27;burn rate&#x27; of
a sole proprietor solo founder,
I should be on a nice path of &#x27;organic&#x27;
growth and still 100% owner.<p>Yes, my situation is not &#x27;standard&#x27;,
but neither are successes in the VC
business.<p>The VCs need to learn how
to look at and reliably evaluate work
that is new, typically just on paper;
US research academics and high end
US DoD problem sponsors can;
VCs cannot.  So far maybe that lapse
has not much hurt them.  But, generally,
gotta tell you, the VCs are way, way
behind the <i>leading edge</i> of US
science, technology, and entrepreneurship.",1384404197

Stacks of backpropagating  perceptrons with the ancient logistic regression on top - now with more stacking! This makes sense.<p>Machine learning is really just a form of non-human scripting. After all, every ML system running on a PC is either Turing equivalent or less. An analogy would be something that tries to generate the minimal set of regular expressions (that match non deterministically) which cover given examples. The advantage of an ML model vs a collection of regexes is many interesting problems are vulnerable to calculus (optimize) or counting (probability, integration etc.)<p>So like good notation, the stacking allows more complicated things to be said more compactly.

Great experience, by the way.<p>I will summarize this process from a Top-Down approach, in case you&#x27;re a CS major. (Note that engineering is Bottom-Up!)<p>- C/C++ gets converted into Assembly Language.<p>- Assembly Language gets converted into bytes.
(One or more bytes encode each machine instruction and data)<p>- Each machine instruction takes multiple clock cycles to execute.<p>- On each clock cycle, a &quot;microcode&quot; (a.k.a. Register Transfer Language) moves data around.
(The order in which data are moved from one register to another is controlled by a Finite State Machine.)<p>- Each finite state machine is composed of sequential circuits and combinational circuits: multiplexers, decoders, etc.<p>- Each sequential circuit is composed of some type of memory element : flip-flops, latches, etc.
(Sequential circuits can be static, quasi-static, or dynamic. In all cases, they are composed of combinational logic with feed-back.)<p>- Combinational logic is composed of CMOS (MOSFET) transistors. In the past, we used BJTs... and they&#x27;re actually making a comeback.<p>- Transistors are arranged in such a way as to perform logic equations: Inverter, NAND, NOR, etc.
(Look up a CMOS Inverter to know what I&#x27;m talking about.)<p>Pretty easy, right!?!<p>I want to encourage you to look at the following references, in order.<p>(1) CMOS Digital Integrated Circuits by Kang and Leblebici --the best digital VLSI book ever
	(2) Digital Logic Circuit Analysis & Design by Nelson et al. --tough book on digital logic, but pretty good
	(3) Computer System Architecture by Morris Mano --works its way up from logic design (K-maps, etc.) to state machines to assembly language<p>And now, I&#x27;m going to through a curve ball at you: Any algorithm you can implement in software, you can also implement in hardware.<p>How is this possible? Hint: Think of Finite State Machines.
And then look into ASIC and FPGA design of digital filters and digital control systems.",1384403640

5021215,story,,,1,1,abhpdk,"Ask HN: Is this a good scenario to use node.js?",,"A couple of my friends and me are planning to make a time tracking web application. Between us we have experience in Java, C++, Django and Backbone.js, though we have never made any full fledged commercial application. This is our first real project and we wanted a bit more clarity before learning nodejs.<p>More about the app:<p>Users will use this application through out the day to log various tasks (sort of like a task management application)
,track the time spent on these tasks (time tracking).
Users do not interact with each other's tasks.We expect users to use this app continuously throughout the day.<p>So we want the app to have high Performance. We also foresee making native mobile applications (ios & Android) in the future, which can work with the same API used for the web. JSON and javascript are very appealing due to this. We also don't want to re-write code on the client and server.<p>I have already checked out this answer: How to decide when to use NodeJS? but would really like some more clarity.<p>Is node.js a good fit for this scenario? What advantages would it have over, say Django+Backbone.js?<p>Also at SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14197870/is-this-a-good-scenario-for-using-nodejs/14198179",1357570772

Only half way done with cs50x at the moment but 6.00x is over other than the final exam.<p>I feel like cs50x explains the ""hows"" and ""whys"" in much more detail, mainly because we're dealing with a lower level language.<p>For example, I know exactly what's happening on the stack now and what role the heap plays and how to balance my data between the 2 to tweak the performance and make trade offs. You don't learn this stuff on MIT's course.<p>Also MIT's course spent half the semester running simulations and dealing with statistics using pylab.

The most you could hope for is enough woman wearing them so that they have a deterrent effect on would-be rapists.  But if enough people hear about them, and the rapists know to expect them, what's to stop the rapist from simply removing it?  I would also expect that if the condom functioned as expected, it would mostly just serve to enrage the rapist and make it more likely for him to escalate the level of violence.<p>On a more emotional level: the woman still gets raped.  What's more, she has to ritually insert an object that only works if she does get raped.  I can't imagine that being good for one's psyche.<p>Which is not to say we shouldn't search for interesting solutions wherever we can find them.  But I'm very skeptical that some gadget is going to solve this problem.<p>Protesting and agitating for social change is probably the most effective route that's available right now.

Last.FM's database is pretty extensive and even relatively obscure artists can often be found, but sometimes you will run into one that isn't there. Multiple and alternative sources of music knowledge is definitely something we're considering especially for more obscure artists that Last.FM might not have. That being said, the search can be fickle, so if you enter half of a name it might show no results but if you enter the full name it might show up, so there's a chance that you could be tricked into thinking an artist isn't there when it is.<p>The ability to remove what's coming up next preemptively is a good idea.

There's no good reason to be adding a date variable to your method signature just to make everything functional. Because you then have to declare and initialize that variable extra times.<p>Exactly, and that's why DI is useful: it forces you to make a distinction between dependencies and real parameters. You really want your method signature to only accept parameters that are going to change throughout the life of your application while being injected with the dependencies it needs. Something like:<p><pre><code>    @Inject
    private Database db;
    
    public void updateName(String id, String name) {
      User u = db.find(id);
      u.setName(name);

The consumer simply receives a reference to an IArticleService and uses it, while the constructor of the service knows how to wire things up and hand out service references to consumers that need it so that the consumers don't need to know how to do the wiring up;  this is precisely what a dependency injection engine does.<p>It's the difference between you walking to a Post Office and saying ""mail(this envelope)"" and you saying ""mail(this envelope, put it into truck x, route it via [A, B, C, D], find it in the corner of truck D weeks later and route it through E, give it to Alice to give to Bob to place it in the customer's post office box)"".

5021137,comment,5017486,5020068,1,0,IamBren,,,"I agree with you on needing evidence, and as I said before, he references every claim in his books, in his newsletters, and even on his blog. As to whether they are solid references, I don't know. Most of them are from medical journals and studies I don't have access to.<p>But either way, who benefits? His entire plain consists of cutting out things like salt, sugar and added fats, and only eating vegetables, fruits, nuts, beans and seeds in some order (as a very basic summary). What does he have to gain aside from maybe selling a book? Once you know the plan most people need nothing else from him.<p>As to your lone voice claim, I haven't seen that. He works with several doctors, nutritionists, and researchers (NOT just Oz) and seems to have a thriving medical practice that has helped thousands of people.<p>As to the rest of your concerns:<p>1. What courses? I've never seen him sell any courses, unless you mean site membership, which is optional and for support only if you need it. Unless he has stock in all the major produce growers of the world, I'm not sure what he truly has to sell once a person buys the book and follows his plan. Everything else (like supplements) is optional and for support only if you need it.<p>2. $7 one time, not monthly. I'm puzzled why why these aren't free too. Like I said, he references every one of his claims, if you're into that. There are hundreds of references to various medical journals, papers, studies, etc. in his book Eat To Live, for example.<p>3. I think he uses H = N/C not as a true math equation, but as more of a shortcut to help people remember to get as many nutrients per calorie as they can (which is fundamental to his plan). I'm surprised you and others are getting hung up on this (and with such ridicule) without even bothering to understand it in context.<p>4. True, but what's his incentive? To sell more produce? He doesn't sell a miracle cure, and I can tell you right now that eating the way he wants you to eat is certainly not simple for me and many others. One thing I've noticed is that the bulk of people coming to him seem to be those (like me) who have spent years in pain due to ""incurable"" diseases, or people who have already had multiple bypass surgeries and everything else, and are sent home to prepare for death. It seems suffering provides extreme motivation.<p>5. I can't disagree with you on this one.<p>I can understand your skepticism a little, but it's not as if his website is a long form sales letter with javascript BUT WAIT popups when you try to exit it. Isn't one function of a website, I would say the primary function even, to market something? He markets his ideas and sells <i>optional</i> products for the benefit of his patients. What's shady about that? No miracle cure diets, pills, ""free reports"", etc. No long form sales letters.<p>I'd just hate for people to live a life of pain and suffering believing ""inflammation in the colon has nothing to do with what is eaten"" when it probably does, and when something can be done about it that doesn't necessarily involve their colon being removed and/or an early death.",1357569846

I think you're right, and part of the problem here is the time example clouding people's judgement. The fact that we as humans experience time as a continuous global phenomenon is irrelevant from a software engineering perspective. The current time is data no different from any other data.<p>It's not even difficult to think of an example of your point about the assumption quickly becoming false.

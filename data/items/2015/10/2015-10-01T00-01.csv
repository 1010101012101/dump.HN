So rather than blocking ads outright, EFF’s aim has been to incentivize better behavior by advertising companies. ... Adzerk provides ad serving infrastructure to Reddit, BitTorrent, and a number of other high profile sites.  They will be offering the ability for any publisher using their platform to serve ads that respect Do Not Track requests.  If publishers choose to deploy such ads, they will not be blocked by default by Adblock, Disconnect, Privacy Badger or other coalition members.&quot;</i><p>So that&#x27;s the EFF selling out. Ad spam is fine, as long as the ad spammer claims to comply with some privacy policies, and ad blockers shouldn&#x27;t block EFF-approved spam.

Sure enough, in civilized countries like Germany, or Sweden, or Denmark, college isn&#x27;t thought off as a significant expense that requires ROI calculations because it is free. That&#x27;s how it should be, given that the market does not understand the value of education.<p>It is only in this corporate-run hyper-capitalistic country that we&#x27;re having this ridiculous conversation.

Personally, I&#x27;m of the opinion that all beverages should be basically sold in three sizes: a small refillable &quot;I&#x27;m in a hurry&quot; travel size (say, 0.5 - 1L), a standard refillable daily-use container (say, 2 - 2.5L) and a refillable family container (say, 5L). Additionally, there should be an option to refill your bottle. It could be even metered by 1ml or something. The pre-bottled versions should be adequately more expensive - taxed with a recycling fee, and then taxed <i>again</i> with a &quot;we know you ain&#x27;t gonna recycle anyway&quot; pollution fee.<p>I think pretty much every kind of food stuff that you buy regularly - things like ketchup, or oil, or spices, or pickles, etc. - should be available this way.<p>Because if you step outside your daily routine and look at the shopping experience, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s absolutely ridiculous how much packaging you buy and throw away all the time, week after week. If you know that you&#x27;re using, say, a 500ml of ketchup every week, you should be able to get a 2L bottle and refill it once a month instead of having to buy and throw away 6 bottles a month like you do today. Now take that and multiply it by all the other things you use like this - sauces, sodas, etc., then multiply by the first-world population (say, ~1B) and divide by average family size (say, 3), and you&#x27;ll get <i>billions</i> of bottles going straight to landfill every month. This is just wrong.<p>The absolutely worst offenders are catering companies, who far too often think: &quot;hey, we don&#x27;t know exactly how much people will want to drink, so let&#x27;s go for the least common value and buy a hundred thousand 0.5L bottles&quot;. Or the standard catering/hotel stacking mug size which ensures your guests will waste a lot of bagged tea trying to quench their thirst.<p>The second worst is bottled water. Especially in big cities, where municipal water is often cleaner than the supermarket one, buying bottled water is pure insanity - and yet people keep doing it all the time.",1443661007

I argue (and I know it&#x27;s arguable) that it&#x27;s always a positive. To some degree I think the market agrees with this and, without a clear answer to &quot;what is a good education worth,&quot; has <i>overvalued</i> (or rather, overpriced) the unmeasurable intangible results of a college education, which is one of our problems.<p>Second, I completely disagree that the modern undergraduate university accomplishes neither of these things. It is obscenely expensive (needs correction), but it is not &quot;grotesque,&quot; it is not &quot;hyper-social&quot; in the derogatory sense (simply diversely social, which is neutral/positive), it is not a &quot;playground&quot; other than the type that nurtures minds and enhances opportunities for learning, it is not &quot;cookie cutter&quot; except in the sense of being an effective and repeatable system.<p>The university deserves to survive, it deserves to flourish, and it is an institution deserving respect for the effect it has had and will continue to have on the rise of civilization and the improvement of society.<p>Because it is both difficult to measure and easy to understand such an enormous impact, universities have become expensive. That is regrettable and needs recalibration from a more powerful entity (public universities have it right, but they rightfully need support from society). But don&#x27;t think for a second that the castration of the university to an austere intellectualized minority luxury is the way forward for the institution of higher learning or for society itself.<p>As civilization becomes more complex and more difficult to comprehend, we will only need more and better universities, and ones that continue in the tradition of the liberal arts—that we may continue to be human in the face of ever greater inhumanity. Save us all if we are required to measure that.",1443661001

10308553,comment,10308142,10308142,0,0,simcop2387,,,"I actually had a similar incident with memory loss some years ago.  It wasn&#x27;t because of a tumor but from severe central sleep apnea, that as near as I&#x27;ve ever been able to figure out had been going on for about a decade and was taking a significant toll on my body and brain.  The way he describes the memories coming back to him is much more eloquently put than I&#x27;ve ever been able to manage.  I hadn&#x27;t hit a point where I had lost the ability to reason, but it sounds like the memory loss was comparable.  There was a period of about 2-3 years where I just hadn&#x27;t been able to recall much that happened recently or long ago.  I wasn&#x27;t quite as fortunate (I think) as him with the recovery of memory, there are still people and relationships that I don&#x27;t fully recall and likely never will at this point, but the things that did come back came back in that same kind of jumbled B before A kind of way.  It was incredibly frightening for the first few months like that because memories would just pop into place and I&#x27;d realize that I didn&#x27;t recall them before and feel like I just wasn&#x27;t me during that time, I was some incomplete version of myself and had no idea that I was missing parts of myself.  It&#x27;s an incredible experience to get those things back but it&#x27;s awfully frightening looking back onto the times when they weren&#x27;t there and not being able to help the thought that a large part of you just wasn&#x27;t there for years at a time, and if you&#x27;re really the person that was there before, during, and after the whole thing.  That did lead to a good deal of depression for myself during some of that, after realizing things that I did that just didn&#x27;t look or sound like me because of everything I was missing.  It sounds like he had a lot of help from his friends and family which was tremendous in getting him to this point.  I also likely wouldn&#x27;t have fared nearly as well without mine.",1443660982

I was a liberal arts major (Religious Studies) and through a winding path ended up becoming a programmer. I knew at the time that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do much with my degree, but sometimes people pick degrees because of things besides career options and earnings potential -- and I would argue that these decisions can still be classified as perfectly rational at the time. I thought I&#x27;d work any sort of job to pay off my thankfully small student loans and then become a monk, but life turned out differently. Now you might say that my story is an unusual exception, but I think that similar thoughts (minus monasticism) drive the hearts of most liberal arts majors.<p>We need to consider that in the current educational system we are asking young people who are in the midst of trying to understand the world and their place in it to make a decision that very few are equipped to decide, but which they generally cannot delay, and with which they will incur great cost. And the effects of making this decision will last their entire life -- I myself know that it&#x27;s possible to &quot;pivot&quot;, but extremely difficult to do so.<p>Furthermore, there&#x27;s no guarantee that a job even awaits those who pursue high paying degrees. For anyone who graduated in 2008, those with degrees in finance or MBAs will suffer the consequences of ill timing the rest of their life. Likewise with those who graduated with CS degrees during the dot com crash, or with advanced degrees focused on AI during the AI Winter. Sometimes things completely beyond our control result in what seemed like a prudent decision falling apart.<p>So my point is that our current educational structure is not well suited towards producing people who are resilient to disruption. And I mean disruption in a few senses: graduating when the market for their skills crashes, studying for a decade to get a degree in something that is beginning to be replaced by automation (I know one M.D. in a particular field who is preparing for this), and so on. It of course takes some time to acquire the skills to perform any particular job, and it might be unrealistic to expect someone with a family to even have the time to work and retrain at the same time. I know places like Udacity have things like &quot;nanodegrees&quot; and Coursera has certificates and whatnot, but I remain unconvinced that there are enough, say, web development jobs to meet the demands of both the unemployed and the recently graduated. And once there are too many web developers, what will they retrain to (and what will be the mobility and growth potential of us current developers)?<p>My comment is starting to turn into a blog post, so I&#x27;ll try to wrap it up now. Ultimately I think that disruptive forces -- whether economic, automation-driven, or something else -- will only increase over time, and will exacerbate the already existing problems, causing significant social upheaval because we do not equip people to function in such an environment, but rather try to train them for their lifelong job, which is a thing that no longer exists. And I guess that I just ended up stating one of the motivations behind a liberal arts education (as opposed to something like a trade school where you generally focus upon one particular set of job skills) without even intending to end up here: it&#x27;s not necessarily that you need to know art history or music theory in particular, but that in expanding the scope of your intellect and the modes of thought you are capable of, you will be much better prepared to learn what you do need to learn and to think critically about it.",1443659930

    >> b = a
    => {:a=>5}
    >> a[:a] = 10
    => 10
    >> b
    => {:a=>10}

and now Elixir:<p><pre><code>    bash>> iex

    %{a: 5}
    iex(2)> b = a

    iex(3)> a = %{a | a: 10} # updates a mapping
    %{a: 10}

Is that career goal realistic, or will you just end up another depressed burnout? Plus most graduates won&#x27;t be able to invest $20,000 per year starting at 22, that&#x27;s highly optimistic, and most people who don&#x27;t go to college won&#x27;t have absolutely zero lifetime earnings either.<p>The opportunity cost of time spent attending schools you don&#x27;t enjoy versus doing other things with the &quot;best years of your life&quot; is another factor, too.",1443659838

The reason is when I hand graded, it would take easily hours to finish grading everything. Likewise, students would submit code they copy/pasted from the internet and wouldn&#x27;t compile. After 5 minutes of debugging their code, it begins eating into my overall grading time. Likewise, what percentage should I give them on code that doesn&#x27;t compile? Now, I say a flat &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t compile, the best you get is 20% for proper formatting&quot;.<p>In the first few weeks, I use JUnit and System Rules (I am currently build Python unit tests) to let them only work via the main method. Once we introduce methods, I show them how I call them via my tests.<p>I have also started implementing typing exercises into my weekly work, so students can get a feel before getting thrown to the wolves on the week&#x27;s assignments. If I head to PyCon next year, I hope to present on whether it was successful or not.<p>I am looking to automate grading ala Open edX style submissions, as the biggest problem I have is not being able to give students a grade/notes until around Friday when I grade.<p>One trick I do is lecture all of Monday (2 hour class) and then let them work on their assignment for the week on Wednesday (3 hours). Most students don&#x27;t realize how much time outside of class needs to be spent in the initial semesters of programming. I use that lab time to let them work and act as a helpful tool if they have questions. For example, this week, we&#x27;d gone over building Objects, but the idea of constructors are still shaky to some people. Today, when they were working on their labs, I spent some time with the 1-2 students that needed a little extra help understanding the work to get everything.",1443658694

It all costs money -- maintenance, insurance, expansion, lawyers, advertising, marketing -- money, money, money.  That&#x27;s what has done in the American university system.

This means that a large country could do extremely well, provided it covered the important urban locations. It obviously still takes more effort on the part of the operators to provide this coverage in a large country, but we&#x27;re less affected by this problem than more traditional geographic coverage approaches.<p>Although, that said, I think it could still be interesting and it&#x27;s definitely feedback we&#x27;ll take on board for next time.

Three of the five biggest investment banks in the USA either went bankrupt or were sold off for pennies on their previous value. Fannie and Freddie were essentially bankrupted.<p>These companies share holders were wiped out. That&#x27;s exactly what happens with other businesses in bankruptcy. Well, other than Bear and Merrill stockholders getting a small percent instead of zero.  That was a necessity because an investment bank really can&#x27;t operate through a traditional Chaper 11 bankruptcy.<p>So if you own a bank, you can&#x27;t be confident that you&#x27;ll get bailed out when you fuck up on a grand scale.<p>But there is an issue of industry wide fuck ups and their effect on everyone else. Banks have a very unique feature in that when their competitors falter, they falter with them. In 2008, you have banks with no exposure to the toxic assets having huge issues with liquidity.<p>The bail outs may cause moral hazard for that sort of counter-party risk. For example, if you are Goldman Sachs maybe you don&#x27;t ask too many questions about AIG insurance because you figure the government will make good on it either way.<p>This is a very complicated issue.",1443657736

Let us consider just two massive obstacles, the second of which will have even larger and more far reaching ethical implications than the ones discussed in this article.<p>1) Durable cybernetics implants. Have you ever seen the margin of an open wound needed to run the wires for the datarates needed to send or receive neural signals? I have, they are nasty, nasty things that only the severely disabled would start to consider. Our materials science knowledge here (cerebral spinal fluid is basically like ocean water, corrosive as all hell) is at least 10 or 15 years away from basic things. Our knowledge of how to get data in and out without wires at sufficiently high bandwidth is also at least 15 years. Preventing gliosis that blocks any electrodes from sending and receiving after a year? Not even going to speculate on that one. And this only names a tiny fraction of the issues here.<p>2) Effective human viral vectors or other gene delivery methods. Unless you are planning to genetically engineer humans to have channelrhodopsins (actually might be more viable in the short run) you have to get the genes for these things in there. I know of a couple studies looking at viral injections for gene therapy in Alzheimer&#x27;s patients, transfection rates are exceptionally low because most of our best viruses for animal work suck in humans since we already have an immune response to them. Like with point 1 also have to crack someone&#x27;s head open, which is a gigantic risk to the point where if someone wanted a channelrhodopsined super soldier they&#x27;d do the injection before training (at which point human genetic engineering would be more effective anyway).<p>tl;dr Absurdly premature to worry about this and there will probably be better and more fundamentally disturbing ways of accomplishing the same things. Hell, stick with the tried and true Amphetamine if you want results. Also don&#x27;t worry about Hyperion Ouster style interrogation techniques being employed any time in the remotely foreseeable future.<p>Fun thought: aren&#x27;t human beings biological weapons?",1443657686

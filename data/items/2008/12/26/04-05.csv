The fact that so many donors bitch about frankly miniscule CEO compensation proves that the majority of them are not in it to improve the world -- or at least that there are other things they want out of their donation.",1230267176

409957,comment,409696,409877,0,0,whacked_new,,,"If the conclusion is based on that thread, then, I think neither did that thread establish that conclusion, nor is that sentiment very strong, although I also feel like this is a polar issue. Disclaimer: I err on the ""critical period"" side of the debate. I also don't take an absolute stance (as in, there exists a time T where when age > T, native proficiency is impossible. I think it is a continuum of rates, but it drops fast and irreversibly. I also think there really hasn't been anything strong on the other side of the argument, so take my bias however you will).<p>A very simple scenario here with somewhat related background: take absolute pitch for example. I don't think anybody would argue that absolute pitch cannot be acquired, if you are an adult, don't have it already, and set out to acquire it. Some people can achieve it to some degree, but the phenomenon of AP, strictly speaking, is entirely unlike what these people train themselves to do.<p>There are clear neural signatures associated with people with ""true"" AP, and to this extent the most likely explanation is that a combination of early training, and biological predisposition, are important factors in AP development. The literature seems to point to 7 years as about the ""cutoff"" for the ""critical point.""<p>Now the thought experiment. It is possible to invent a language that <i>requires</i> AP: we would encode special meanings to certain frequency classes. (this is not at all a stretch, given the existence of several whistle languages). Then, if you pass the critical point of AP acquisition, there is no chance of you learning this language.<p>Okay, maybe that was extreme, but as we relax the constraints bit by bit (like how rigid the frequency classes are defined), we can create languages that require different degrees of AP ability. In this thought experiment, I would expect a readily observable critical period effect.<p>Suppose this all follows through -- then, these languages <i>must</i> be learned as children.",1230266557

409952,comment,409659,409914,0,0,tdavis,,,"Well, I have a tendency to be naturally adverse to anything that is incredibly hyped, so that should frame it. However, I have many complaints with the language itself and things surrounding it, so here I go, in no particular order:<p>- I don't like the overall community. That is not to say I do not like Ruby hackers, period -- a number of my friends fall into the category. However, I do not like the general holier-than-thou attitude that much of the community takes and the fact that they seem to spend more time talking about how fucking awesome Ruby is than they spend actually writing code. In many ways the community is young and I believe it has a lot of maturing to do. Once again, this obviously does not apply to <i>everyone</i>, but one of the most important attributes of a programming language (at least to me) is its community on the whole.<p>- I don't give a damn how ""cool"" a language is and this seems to be not only a general argument for it, but also a method by which many tutorials and other literature explain or introduce the language.<p>- I am of the opinion that Ruby is far more ad-hoc than it is elegant, and I think many are simply confusing the two. Sometimes you need (), sometimes you don't. Some people think the lack of ""unnecessary"" parenthesis makes the language more elegant, I just say it makes it harder to determine if something is an attribute or a method, for example. I don't believe there should be 50 different ways to do the same thing; there should be a couple different ways and one of them should almost always be considered ""the best"".<p>- What's intuitive for one person may not be so for another; it's not a universal thing and as such I do not find the language as intuitive as hyped. For instance, I find the following completely unintuitive:<p><pre><code>    ['list',...]. each { |food| print( food.capitalize ) }\n</code></pre>\nWhy? Because it looks nothing like a standard <i>for</i> loop. In Python, I can do a similar one-line loop over a list, but the syntax is far more intuitive <i>to me</i> because it <i>looks</i> like a loop:<p><pre><code>    for food in [...]: print food.capitalize()\n</code></pre>\nThere are class variables and instance variables and constants and globals and you define one of them using <i>@@</i> and <i>CapFirst</i> for another and... it just feels like a cluster-fuck to me.<p>- Despite all the Ruby community hand-waving about how ""Ruby can't scale is a myth"" and so forth, the fact remains that it is a (relatively speaking) young language which has many significant shortcomings -- shortcomings that even its own creator acknowledges. Except, many try to ignore these when they shouldn't.<p>Do I think Ruby has nothing going for it? No. Do I think it has no hope of improving and growing? No. I do, however, believe that it has a <i>lot</i> of growing, improving, and maturing to do before it is even half as godlike as so many feel it is (or just feel they need to <i>say</i> it is). That being said, I don't think I will ever use Ruby -- for these and other reasons (this is already too long). I imagine I will at least be <i>civil</i> towards it... eventually ;)",1230266040

409940,comment,409467,409467,0,0,thinkzig,,,"A few other tips to add here beyond the other great ones already mentioned.  I had to learn about these the hard way.<p>1.) Massage.<p>You may not think it's the manliest thing ever, but if you can afford it you should find a good local masseuse and get yourself an hour session.  Even if you go once and never go again, you'll get an education in just how kinked up your back and shoulders probably are.<p>I tweaked my back lifting a lawn mower out of my car a couple years ago and didn't think much of it at the time.  Over the next few weeks I started to have all kinds of shoulder problems and other various pain to the point where my arms were getting tingly and I couldn't sit and code for more than 30 minutes at a time.<p>Long story short, I went through a few doctors before I finally just decided to see a masseuse and see if it helped.  I was lucky to find someone that knew what they were doing and helped get me straightened out.   It took about 5 sessions over 5 weeks, but I've never had problems since.<p>2.)  Trigger points.<p>Learn what they are and how you can fix them.  This was my problem that the masseuse turned me on to.  Trigger points are essentially little micro-knots in your muscle fibers that can add up to cause big problems for you.  For me, lifting that mower was really just the straw that broke the camel's back.  It just exacerbated all the trigger point problems I'd been creating over years of coding and not stretching out my back and shoulders properly.<p>If you know where the common trigger points creep up and how to get rid of them you can save yourself a lot of pain and downtime (not to mention massage bills).<p>Buy these two things: The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Treatment/dp/1572243759/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1230263929&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Point-Therapy-Workbook-Self-Tr...</a>) and a TheraCane (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Thera-Cane-Theracane-TheraCane/dp/B0007YZ1BM/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=hpc&qid=1230263980&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Thera-Cane-Theracane-TheraCane/dp/B000...</a>)<p>The book will show you how to identify and treat the trigger points all over your body, and the TheraCane will help you reach the places on your back that you can't reach yourself.<p>3.) Yoga.<p>Once you get all your issues straightened out, yoga and/or a good daily stretching regimen can help keep you kink free.<p>Hopefully some of this advice is helpful.  I was really messed up for a while until I figured all this out.  Again, echoing what others have said, please take care of your body.  It's the only one you have.",1230264403

8728623,comment,8724727,8727185,0,0,Ultimatt,,,"You wont get many opinions of people&#x27;s experience of Perl6 from Hacker News. Just a lot of rage and assumptions it&#x27;s somehow just like Perl5, which it&#x27;s not. There are only a few of us (tens, maybe a hundred very quiet people) actually writing it daily. With no official &quot;released&quot; 6.0.0 version it&#x27;s not supported that well by Linux distros yet either. Like if you install Rakudo on Debian stable right now it would be about two years out of date iirc. In the last two years a custom Perl6 VM was written with a JIT compiler and tonnes of concurrency stuff was added! You can however easily install it yourself and keep up to date with rakudobrew <a href=""http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/day-2-rakudobrew/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/2014/12/02/day-2-rakudobrew...</a><p>My $0.02 is you&#x27;d mostly want to learn Perl6 if you were after something like Ruby but perhaps with more room to express yourself and form a community and build new technologies. At least I really love the language and find it very expressive and intuitive to use and it has a lot of features useful for doing Bioinformatics built in (something I&#x27;m going to add to the P6 advent calendar on the 15th Dec). The extra level of detail ten years of design puts into a language like all the funky features working together and being consistent helps a lot. So much of the cooler expressive/functional stuff in Python feels out of place like lambda and list comprehensions. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I wouldn&#x27;t write anything /that/ complicated or important using Python lambda or list comprehensions. They just don&#x27;t play that well with the surrounding code you will have to write in a different style. I can&#x27;t attest to Ruby since I don&#x27;t know it well. I felt it was quite close to Perl and I&#x27;d be better placed learning Python instead, especially for a job writing code that wasn&#x27;t for the web.",1418209044

However my gut instinct is that self similarity mean shorter code (dna) shorter dna (protein chains) take less energy to copy thus gives you a survival advantage (often survival for plants means getting set up and leaves out fast).

8728617,comment,8727947,8728432,0,0,lnanek2,,,"Taxis in the SF bay area have always been a joke. The few times I&#x27;ve called them they often say they have no drivers in the area, or they claim they will send the driver but he never shows up, or they send one and it takes an hour. Hailing one in the street like NYC has never worked for me. There is no penalty to a driver if he picks someone up on the street before he gets to you, so they usually don&#x27;t get to you. In Uber their rating would drop and eventually they would get fired. Not to mention Uber lets you order the cab without a call detecting your location, watch the car come to you on the map, communicate with the driver the entire time, and handles all the payment. So the innovation over taxis is enormous.",1418208930

Microprocessors can be used to generate fractals simply because they can execute the generation rules of a fractal, but you could could likewise generate them with anything which can perform a specific affine transformation, for instance a copy machine. An affine transformation is simply a linear transformation together with a translation, for fractals the linear transformation would typically be a scaling composed with a rotation.

I could share a hash with you, and from the command line you could simply type &quot;fetch L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI&quot; just as you&#x27;d use wget.<p>This would be a hash of an index file that describes the data, broken into small chunks. Now your client goes back onto the network and finds the cheapest way to retrieve all these chunks. You could set a default, &quot;5 cents per GB&quot; that you&#x27;re willing to pay.<p>Servers could monitor the network and see what&#x27;s being requested often, and pay to download (and re-serve) these chunks themselves in the hopes of profiting. When files become rare, servers could charge a premium.<p>Bitcoin is not a micropayment system, so paying per chunk would be expensive. You could pre-pay, say 1GB at a time at first, and slowly build up a trusted reputation where you only pay afterwards (by reusing a bitcoin address as your &quot;identity&quot; that you always send from). You&#x27;d work out a &quot;contract&quot; (signed with your sending address), give it to the server, and if you skip out on paying they could use it as proof of nonpayment which they would share with other servers. (Maybe all servers have a blacklist file they share for free). They could try to send you bogus data, but since you can verify by-the-chunk you wouldn&#x27;t request more chunks from them once you&#x27;ve received a piece that fails a hash.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got this network in place, you could build any of the things the author in this link is describing. My hope, a Usenet 2.0 style protocol. The whole thing is very exciting. But first you need a simple, generic, data-for-bitcoin network.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve seen so far in the bitcoin/storage area (maidsafe, storj) sounds overly complicated and downright scammy. I don&#x27;t want to back up my data to a p2p network. I don&#x27;t want to have to purchase a new altcoin to use your network.

So I&#x27;m a drug runner and it&#x27;s illegal for me to take your money and point you to the guy at the other side of the street who has your stuff, but it&#x27;s OK when I give you a piece of paper with a map to a rock under which is another paper with a phone nr which you need to call that will then tell you to walk to the other side of the street?<p>Or let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m an electrician who wires indoor marihuana plantations. That is illegal. Do you think it would be OK to stand next to some other guy and tell him what switch to connect to which socket and which tools to use to strip the wire? &#x27;Oh your honor I was just distributing <i>instructions</i> on how to build a plantation, not doing it!&#x27;. You might want to prepare your diddly hole when you rely on such argumentation as a legal defense.<p>Again: INTENT MATTERS. When something is done with enough proximity to actual illegal actions, that &#x27;something&#x27; is quite likely also illegal and punishable. Which is why Uncle Fester is a free man and Kim Dotcom isn&#x27;t (well only barely).",1418205654

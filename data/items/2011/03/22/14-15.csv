Sexism is rampant.  BUT they want mothers to have babies, so they figured out how to make that happen.<p>The system isn't perfect by a long shot, and it's not always ideal to have the state raise your kids as much as tends to happen here, but it's certainly quite successful: the birth rate is about 2 births per woman and slowly <i>rising</i>.",1300805910

Even though there aren't any Regular Expressions for attribute matching, It actually lets you do some nice conditioning. Consider this:<p><pre><code>  article a[href^=”http”]:not([href*=""yourdomain.com/""]) {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis will match all links within an article that begin with http, but don't contain your domain name. Essentially those are external links, with the exception of maybe http://facebook.com/yourdomain.com/ and alike.<p>If you're certain that all your links will rewrite to and absolute path with the www subdomain through unencrypted http protocol, you can even match more efficiently:<p><pre><code>  article a {\n    external-link: style;\n  }\n\n  article a[href^=""http://www.yourdomain.com""] {\n    your-link: style;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nFor matching all links that don't contain your domain name (mailto, skype) and so on:<p><pre><code>  a[href*="":""]:not([href*=""yourdomain.com])\n</code></pre>\nHowever, make sure you narrow that selector down to the specific piece of content where you want outbound links marked, as it will probably match javascript: links. But you should make sure those have a fallback url and behave with JavaScript anyway.<p>Hope this turns a few JavaScript lines into CSS for you.<p>Cheers!\nLinks and tips at: http://twitter.com/some1else",1300804056

Some seasoned UNIX users don't like that. Development is active, as per my [1]<p>I don't run Plan 9 proper (yet); instead a POSIX port of some of its goodies: the Plan 9 from Userspace [2]. Works on virtually any POSIX OS.<p>In short, Acme fits me. Fast for common tasks (text navigation and mangling), powerful for ad-hoc text processing.<p>Acme is a bit of an oddball in UNIX land: strictly a GUI (requires a mouse with three buttons) blended with power of CLI tools and regular expressions. A good deal of text transformations happens via command language derived from sed (should be familiar to any Vi user). If you want to indent a block of text, you select it first and execute Edit s,^,    ,g. Alternatively you can indicate the text with regular expressions.<p>A lot more happens via the good old UNIX pipe -- you can transform text, send as standard input and inject from standard output of a pipeline.<p>The Bell Labs guys figured some operations on text are done quicker using mouse. Cut/Paste are mouse chords. There is no separate `Copy' -- Cut & Paste back in place is quick enough. You can indicate place (or range) in file via regular expression, but you can indicate it by mouse -- often faster.<p>Acme yields to scripting very well. A script `learns' of the window (probably a file or directory pathname) it was launched from via the `$%' env variable and often operates on it. Programs are free to open new and modify existing Acme windows via simple `API' consisting of a bunch of files and directories. For me, a few scripts tailored for current project work better than a generic IDE. Any output appears back in Acme, which bodes well with the following:<p>Acme considers any text a potential hyperlink -- including directory listings and output of any program. Right-click on file name opens the file, on <i>file:line</i> expression opens file at that line etc. Also available <i>file:/regular-expression</i>; you can define more via plumber configuration. In general, clicking on a word causes it to be sent to plumber [3] and interpreted according to text processing rules & existence of files; an URL launches a browser, a man(1) indicator opens manpage etc. If nothing useful can be opened, the text is simply searched for in the current window. To navigate directory/file tree, you click on the names you want to go to.<p>A middle click executes commands. A dozen of built-in commands are recognized, all else is passed to shell. It's customary to prepare short snippets of shell code in place and execute them with middle click. Possibly appending arguments via a mouse chord.<p>Acme is a second iteration of GUI editor by Rob Pike; first is Sam [4]. They have a lot in common, especially the comman language.<p>----<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2350204"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2350204</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://swtch.com/plan9port/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/plan9port/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumber_(program)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumber_(program)</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_(text_editor)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_(text_editor)</a><p>----<p>And btw., what's `soapdog'? ;-)",1300804020

Perhaps the reason they don't sound like experts to younger folks is because they've become experts in a field we don't care about: how to view life once you have the proper perspective. After a certain point, how many lines of code or how fast your site can scale takes a back seat to how to lower your blood pressure and how to maximize your enjoyment from ""simple"" pleasure like family and food.",1300802746

All news sources have bias, but the way that Al Jazeera is being upheld as a beacon of truth and light is a little disingenuous. I admit my own bias against them for acting as the mouthpiece of bin Laden by airing his tapes. I know there are those that feel this is a journalistic responsibility, but, then again, I don't think the New York Times should have published the Unabomber's letter either.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.cjr.org/the_water_cooler/dave_marash_why_i_quit.php?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cjr.org/the_water_cooler/dave_marash_why_i_quit.p...</a>",1300802745

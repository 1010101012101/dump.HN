The way child porn is defined, I do not necessarily abhor it.  One 17-year-old in a legal relationship [in case anyone out there thinks age of consent is 18 everywhere, google age of consent; you're in for a shock], taking nude photos of him/herself and sending them to his/her partner, is classified as ""child porn"" under current federal law.<p>The average person, hearing ""child porn"", conjures images of minors being abducted and abused in some basement, or being abused by relatives.  If only child porn laws were tailored that narrowly.<p>(I completely agree with the main premise of the article, but this bill is hardly a new phenomenon.  Pedophilia (technically pre-pubescent minors), ephebophilia (post-pubescent minors) and/or child porn has been one of the four horsemen of the infocalypse[1] for many years.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalypse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Infocalyps...</a>",1312304341

2837795,comment,2837120,2837531,4,0,pavlov,,,"The big difference is that Hype and Edge use CSS properties for animation. The image composition is built up from <div> elements whose style properties are modified by JavaScript. This means the animation capabilities are limited to those properties that can be expressed using CSS -- although this is not such a bad limitation at all, because CSS3 is now so powerful and starting to be widely supported.<p>Radi operates on a lower level to render its animations in HTML. Layers in Radi don't directly become <div> elements in the output; instead, the layer content is rendered either within <canvas> or <video> elements. You can use both together, for example using canvas to overlay some dynamic graphics context on top of a video.<p>To me, the capability to render content seamlessly to either video or canvas is the most unique thing about Radi. Although I'm still not quite sure how to express that as a benefit to the user, rather than a tech-spec curiosity... :)<p>(It's possible to do some limited CSS animation in Radi as well. There's a concept called ""timeline events"" that can be used to animate top-level element properties, so you can also use this model of animation on top of the canvas/video rendering... But it's currently limited to opacity only, so this feature is very much in its infancy.)",1312304317

For a small app, one of my test suites takes about a minute for 100 tests.  That's crazy!<p>This author seems to suggest persistence is the issue, but that doesn't make any sense to me.  A disk hit is like, what, 10ms?  Even if every one of my tests hit the DB once, and if there was no caching, that still would only be 1s.  If I set the development database to be an in-memory SQLite, would that magically speed up my tests 100%?  (I kind of doubt it.)<p>When I run rake tests, there seems to be some super long delay on the rake part, and not on the test part.  Is the slow test speed related to loading and unloading the code in development (which apparently 1.9.2 is slow at)?  Is this due to some rake bug?  How would I even find out?",1312304301

Hundreds of millions in many cases.  And the cost to create a generic version is very low.  Think tens of thousands.  And the time even lower (think weeks).<p>So you have a situation where you can spend $300M over 5 years to create a new drug (due to various regulations in bringing a drug to market), which will have generic competition in two months after release.  That makes doing that type of drug research a non-starter.  It's not like the drug maker can just keep improving the drug.<p>That doesn't happen in most other industries, where your 1 year of research and development largely gives you a 3-6 month advantage (you can release whatever you want, whenever you want).  And you can then continue to improve the product at a brisk rate, building on what you've done.  Google today is not the Google from a decade ago.  They've taken their technology and improved it at a rapid rate, such that the current product is magnitudes better.  You can't do that for most drugs.",1312304164

It was the late 90s, the world of technology seemed to be one of limitless potential, and I got the entrepreneurship bug. So, I dropped out and followed my dream - this particular company (like yours) did fairly well and I got to exit with my head held high.<p>After I sold my company, I spent the rest of my twenties working some interesting gigs and honing my skillset. But that unfinished degree kept plaguing me - I constantly wondered how much further I could go if I had a piece of paper behind my name.<p>So, I went back to University and finished a marketing degree. I didn't learn a whole lot during the degree - business degrees are about as useless as you can get. But, I definitely gained value. Being significantly older than anyone else in my classes meant that my peers were other more mature students with work experience, graduate students and professors. That network is worth way more than the cost of tuition and made going back to school incredibly worth it.<p>As an aside, that network actually helped me start my next business, which I launched a few days after convocation. That business failed miserably, so either the network wasn't worth all that much, or I was a bonehead...:)",1312302997

There's no reason the damn text editor should be slow.<p>- Too many options, many of which are such extreme edge cases they're better off being hidden in a config file.<p>- Eclipse wants to manage too much of your project for you. It tends to package up and write files in it's own way, which is incredibly dense and very much the ""Eclipse way"" of doing things.<p>- Workspaces? I don't care where you have my ""Workspace"", I'll tell you where I want to save my projects though. On a project by project basis.<p>- Which version of Eclipse should I download?

EVERYTHING.

The nested for loop was fine with a small number of checkboxes and products, but as I got more products and more checkboxes, it began to slow down. My friend pointed out that it was Big O of N squared and explained what that meant. It was eye-opening.<p>I rewrote it to first compile a list of checked features (one pass through the checkboxes) and then show/hide the products (one pass through the products), which scales linearly.<p>I can't say that I think about Big O every time I write an algorithm, but I do have a sense that nested loops are dangerous.",1312301746

You pay $1.99 and you get their app. Your comment decries the entire Amazon model as benefiting them and not the developer.<p>I don't agree with this and here is why... let's say this company had a subscription-based app or some in-app-payment-enabled app. Suddenly it is on 101k new devices and let's say that 5k of them (5%) buy some simple subscription or even less, some 1-time-in-app-micro-resource inside the app for $.99.<p>Now suddenly this blog post has a very positive tone to it and the developers are praising Amazon for such a progressive app sales model and we are all here nodding our heads about how awesome it is and you and I are high-fiving each other over Skype Video because we are so excited.<p>The Amazon model isn't broken and it's not building a market <i>on the backs</i> of its developers. It can be an aggressive, mutually-beneficial relationship if both parties are prepared to take advantage of what Amazon has to offer. These guys weren't ready for that <i>yet</i>, but I am willing to bet dollars to donuts that come this time next year they will have a new app back in Amazon App Store, ready to do the 1-day-free-giveaway AGAIN, but this time they are going to be prepared to take advantage of all the traffic.<p>----------------------<p>Its also unnecessarily diminutive to say '... I have to point out that the sales BEFORE the free-app-of-the-day listing[1] were not impressive..."". The fact of the matter is they made infinitely more money before the deal of the day then we can say they did AS A DIRECT RESULT of the deal of the day listing.<p>---------------------<p>I agree that my comment came off way too demeaning and I didn't mean it that way.

Your persistence layer generally lives below the model and knows how to persist your model's entities however you so choose. The ActiveRecord pattern really muddles this distinction by putting all of your persistence code right in with your business logic.

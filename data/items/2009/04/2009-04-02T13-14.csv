543328,comment,542716,542716,0,0,jpedrosa,,,"Seeing the April 1st date of the article it was just a little bit harder to believe they would write it like that. As folks have taken it seriously...<p>The Ruby community was formed without being forced into it necessarily. Academics did not force people into Ruby. Businesses did not force people into Ruby. Even Ruby on Rails was created because DHH was not forced to use PHP and instead tried to make things work in this new called Ruby.<p>Scala has its followers but Academics push it and business types can push it as well even though many business types still prefer Java and C#. Also, Scala is being primarily used for server-side stuff which is a very crowded market already and many developers are just a little bit too tired of having to interface with complex server-side stuff while trying to innovate on the client-side.<p>Thing is, as a guy who really digs Ruby, Scala does not worry me one bit. I could always try and use a hyper-advanced Scala implementation or application in the future given I can make choices at one point and then have to revisit said choices in the future given the changes brought by new developments.<p>Let me tell you a little story. When C# was being first introduced in its very early versions, I was very much playing Ultima Online on pirate servers. A new pirate server was being coded in C# and it was becoming rather popular quite fast and the single developer (or was it?) was having quite a lot of fun with it. Nobody told him to use C# for that kind of thing I am sure, it was just him putting his passion forward with the means he had at the time. C# has grown since then, and many pros and hobbyists use it to create all kinds of little programs on Windows.<p>Scala? Scala has an uphill battle, and many other languages have had their own uphill battles throughout the years. It's tough.",1238680723

They have a similar grasp of the gaming industry that Apple does of the tech world, and it's why they've had such an edge designing. Similar to Apple, they go unexpected directions, and other companies don't seem to get why it is that they surge ahead. They assume it's because of ""gimmicks,"" and add similar gimmicks to their products. Look at how SIXAXIS went compared to the Wiimote and you see something similar to the touch phones that non-Apple companies released to beat the iPhone.<p>It's worth noting that Nintendo is an outright slaughterhouse in terms of sales. In the top 50 weekly VG sales, they have 18 in-house games. 6 of the top 10 (10 of the top 15) are for Nintendo consoles. Only one other company has a game on the list that's sold 5,000,000 copies.

543299,comment,542336,542882,0,0,unalone,,,"So you think that Apple makes good designs just because they're a large company? I've got news for you: the companies they compete against are much larger. Dell and Microsoft could easily afford more designers than even Apple has. The products they churn out are still comparatively worse.<p>You'll notice that Gruber mentions the period in the 80s where Jobs was still an employee as a period which saw similar results. This is not something that requires a huge team. Back with the original Macintosh there was a similar effect. I would hope you've seen the computer's initial unveiling - it's on YouTube - because that's a video that inspires me to this day. Younger, tuxedoed Jobs reveals it, begins using it, and the audience begins half-screaming, in a near-frenzied way. They can't believe that they're seeing what they're seeing. And that's the startup Apple, that's the two-man operation. Back when they didn't have as much in terms of resources, they still focused on creating that simple core, because that's what people care about.<p>You think simplicity and evolution is a bullshit concept? Not that I know anything about you or the stuff you've worked on, so apologies if this sounds ignorant and facetious, but that's at the core of making <i>anything</i>. That's a ""secret"" that I stumbled upon independently. I know a lot of programmers who came upon that - and I find that I respect their work much more than I respect the work of people who don't ""get it"".<p>Look at NewMogul. Do you think that if that site was started by Paul Graham it would be as small as it is right now? No, not because Paul Graham necessarily has a publicity advantage, but because if he were making it he'd most likely go about making it tied in with Hacker News. HN is his simple core model, and NewMogul could be seen as an expansion of that initial concept. As a concept of its own, it's failing - if you wanted to make a huge site for business-interested people, cloning Hacker News is not a smart idea. So the failure comes down not to the design, because the design is quite pretty, but to the concept, which is not simplistic enough to work.",1238679703

It is extremely frustrating to have to pay them more than someone with less experience and fewer skills on paper, but who is perhaps making a tenfold greater contribution to the company.<p>Rigidity in the formula itself is not the only problem.

They were a fantastic bunch altogether, but we had a real star who transferred in. She'd been barely raised above the starting graduate scale, despite making a pretty significant contribution to the company as a whole. When I discovered this, I set about re-assessing her ranking based on the company's formula and basically worked out that her salary needed to double - it had to jump about 3 pay bands. My request was turned down - it was apparently too big a jump! I was left wondering if I should ask her to stop doing some of the things she was doing - like mentoring new employees, since the company wasn't prepared to pay her for it. I didn't stay there, and neither did the star engineer.<p>I think in a smaller, less bureaucratic organization perhaps these schemes have a better chance of working, as long as the formula leaves you enough flexibility.",1238677921

These are essentially predictions too, but you can only go ""short"" on life, so to speak.<p>Catastrophe Bonds, the recently infamous Credit Default Swaps are all instruments that pay off based on an outcome. In other words, they aren't really linked to the price of any commodity directly.<p>So, what gives? What's the difference?",1238677879

Not nearly as much as the US, and no cluster approaching the valley, but the network is a surmountable problem. One could probably get government sponsorship for a regular meetup/conference with speaker honoraria, etc. This would go some way to fixing this problem. Not all the way, but it'd be a start. jlees is looking at this from a Scottish perspective, so maybe getting Scottish Enterprise to sponsor monthly Techcrunch UK shindigs in Edinburgh would be an idea. Again, Scotland suffers the substantial disadvantage of not being London, or within the Golden Triangle. If I were attempting this I'd probably go to one of the Science Enterprise Centres at various UK universities, and attempt to get them to host a monthly meetup, get them to do it in co-operation with the Business School. Again, London would be best.",1238677541

But, just as truly, the design and incentive control we exercise over institutions is a &quot;social technology&quot; that can radically alter which way history goes.  Society <i>does</i> decide what sorts of technologies it builds.  That&#x27;s <i>why</i> we&#x27;re years behind on green energy, for instance: we could have been funding all research proposals regarding thorium reactors or, more speculatively, nuclear fusion <i>decades</i> ago.  Society <i>chose</i> to stick with fossil fuels.  Likewise, we <i>could</i> have built modern networked operating systems with capability security from the ground up -- but <i>we chose</i>, collectively, to stick with a weaker security model that bore more resemblance to what came before it.",1426708790

9228250,comment,9211526,9221260,0,0,msandford,,,"Education is almost 100% funded by property taxes and sales taxes.  Property taxes are a tax on the value of the property, not on your income or your equity in the property, but based on the &quot;fair market value&quot; of the property.  Sales tax is based on the value of the transaction.<p>Everyone lives somewhere, and somewhere basically always has a value attached to it.  Maybe run down apartments aren&#x27;t worth as much as fancy new ones, but property tax still has to be paid.<p>Even if you rent, you still pay property taxes.  The owner of the apartment considers property taxes as a part of his/her expenses the same way a mortgage, insurance, maintenance, etc are expenses.  Those expenses get rolled into the rent.<p>Sales taxes are largely regressive, because any money saved is by default not going to get any sales tax applied.  And poor people spend a larger portion of their income on things which are taxed than wealthier people do; look at the whole &quot;buying experiences&quot; advice that well-to-do participate in.  Those are generally arranged as &quot;services&quot; which aren&#x27;t taxable, rather than products, which are.<p>Progressive taxes are generally based on income, not property value or transaction value.  As a result, funding for education is currently borne fairly evenly amongst people who both have an address and buy things, no matter their income level.",1426708659

9228245,comment,9225079,9225079,0,0,maskedinvader,,,"I absolutely love this game, been playing this for a week now and cannot get enough of this game. My city is now really big (population of 175k).I have not played the latest city sim games, but have played the old games back in the day (like pharoah , pharoah2 ,sim city4 etc). Its amazing that this runs on Unity, supported to run on Windows, Mac OS AND Linux !
Not to mention its very reasonably priced at $30. Having the ability to start of with unlimted money (one of the mods available at release) makes this game really have a very low barrier to entry. You still have to unlock the unique buildings and monuments however. Speaking of unique buildings, to unlock some of them , you need to intentionally cause damage to your city (like cause 50% unemployment or have avg garbage pile up increase). I found myself trying to have throwaway districts intentionally built to be discarded once the unique building is unlocked. unlimited money after all :) 
all in all, great game, absolutely recommend this, however be prepared to lose a lot of productivity for a while ! you are warned.",1426708631

Right now, Spotify just runs a report that takes some top level numbers, splits them out by copyright owner and divides a single pool of money. This means they manage only as many pools of money as they have copyright owners.<p>If they start doing it the way OP suggests, they DRAMATICALLY increase the number of pools of money they manage (and thus, would need to audit).

Additionally, they likely have some errors in their data, and the impact of an error in this scheme is huge.<p>tldr: It&#x27;s too much work for too little money.

A big fat screaming no. A voter guide is a propaganda piece that has ZERO substance. Maybe for the propositions they give a little bit of pros and cons, but for the candidates, they give you nothing.

There have been a number of attempts and none seem to have stuck, except for Go (IMHO). Java tried, and it did not fail altogether, IMHO, but it comes with yet another set of problems, mainly a tendency to lure programmers into over-engineering their solutions (the same, IMHO, goes for C#, which is kind of a sweet language at it core, but that becomes very hard to see among to tangled mess that is the .Net framework).",1426708247

Why does a user who downloads 10GB of data per month on their cable modem have to pay the same price as a user who downloads 300GB? They&#x27;re subsidizing his usage! Why should I have to pay the same price as everyone else for Netflix when I really only ever watch House of Cards?<p>The reason Spotify specifically works this way is because any other reimbursement model is untenable in the streaming world. Rev share works &quot;off the top&quot; because the overhead of managing reimbursement (specifically the audit overhead) at the subscriber level would wipe away too much margin. Pandora had an overly complicated revenue sharing scheme and it nearly bankrupted the company until they moved to a model closer to Spotify&#x27;s.<p>But more specifically, revenue share works this way because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s defined in the contracts that both the major label and the indie label signed. If the indie labels thought it was a terrible idea, they wouldn&#x27;t have signed it.

These days you can mostly rely on all mainstream architectures to do something sensible with e.g. signed integer overflow[1] or excessive shifting, but that wasn&#x27;t necessarily the case when most of C++ was standardized. As an example of a similar nature -- as I&#x27;m sure you know -- Rust has chosen to <i>not</i> abort/panic on signed overflow although almost all instances of such are most probably plain logic errors and could lead to security problems[2]. As far as I could understand, this was for performance reasons. Granted, this is not quite as disastrous for general program correctness as UB, but it can lead to security bugs.<p>Point being: Underspecification can give you a <i>lot</i> of leeway in how you do something -- and that can be hugely valuable in practice.<p>Just as an aside: Personally I tend to prefer safety over performance, but I was persuaded that UB is valuable by comments that Chandler Carruth of Clang (and now ISO C++ committee) fame made about UB actually being essential to optimization in C++.

This is the most dangerous aspect of using PHP. It blocks your learning and understanding. It pulls you down and keep it there.<p>After 10 years of writing PHP I took a look at Python. I was confused for about 10 minutes, until I read about lists and dictionaries and saw they were different things.<p>Who are these people who are just trying to write other languages without looking at the &quot;getting started with data structures&quot; page in the guide, or reading a single book?<p>And why is learning something flexible and easy before learning something more advanced a problem?<p>> So I request every one who is passionate about programming and wants a career in programming to keep away from the php language and community as much as possible.<p>I was writing PHP for a living for a decade. I did a bit of Ruby along the way because it&#x27;s all the same and who cares. I was then invited to CTO at a tech startup in NY, giving me a visa and moving me from the UK.<p>I replaced their shittily built Rails API with a PHP one which was 3x faster, did 10x more and was actually tested properly. Very handy.<p>Now I work for another company, Ride.com. We&#x27;re building an API in Rails and it feels just like the one I built in PHP using Laravel. Almost identical.<p>This comapny got me a visa known as &quot;The Alien of Extraordinary Ability&quot; in which my PHP code was used as the basis of my skills.<p>All of this leads me to think: What the fuck are you talking about.<p>1. Languages rarely matter.

Instead, he explained that I was behaving the only way my brain knew how to behave given the tools and experiences I had had.<p>It sounds a bit like blame passing but it&#x27;s not - there&#x27;s no blaming other people.

So the car I sold to used car dealer which I &quot;paid&quot; 1.6M for was replaced by another car I had bought using some stock money I got from a company that had acquired my startup, when I sold <i>that</i> car 5 years later the stock used to buy the car was worth a bit less than $400. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but the reality was &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve got a car and no car payments.&quot; which at the time was relevant.<p>The message is very much that getting &quot;rich&quot; doesn&#x27;t really matter if you&#x27;re the founder or a later employee, and its pretty random with respect to &quot;skill&quot;. If you happened to be at Sun in the 80&#x27;s and you sold your stock in the late 90&#x27;s you made a lot, if you kept it until Oracle bought the remains, you made much less. Same stock different value. (and yes I had a wee bit of stock left when Oracle bought them)<p>What I learned from that was that making money in the stock market was about targeting a gain and capturing it. So when Facebook went public I bought some at $18 and told my financial advisor to sell it if it ever hit $36 (which it did of course). So for that part of my portfolio I made a bit more than a 100% annual rate of return for that one stock. Its up to $81 today, at some point it will likely be worthless. But for me, it took some of my money and doubled it in less than a year. Good enough for me.<p>But the Ask HN post is about whether or not equity compensation is &quot;worth it&quot; and the answer in the Bay Area has always been &quot;yes&quot;. How much, or how little, extra it is, varies but as long as you wait to exercise and make a profit (yes you pay a bigger tax burden but its always a positive amount of money) it is just &quot;extra&quot; money that you got in addition to your pay. It it worth to work for stock <i>instead</i> of pay? That is a much riskier deal and probably not if you can&#x27;t afford to pay your own bills independently.

Find ways to grant it.<p>4) Don&#x27;t be arbitrary and capricious with your benefits. Simply yanking something is a really good way to breed resentment and cause you to lose even more talent.<p>5) Consider how you&#x27;re communicating with your teams. Are you issuing edicts or asking for help solving problems?<p>6) Think about how you consider developers: Are they valued contributors whom you&#x27;ve hired because they bring something to the table you or others don&#x27;t, or are they 21st century factory workers who crank out pieces based on edicts from someone else? How you view them subconsciously determines how you treat them and as a result, how they will respond to you. It will also determine the kind of talent you&#x27;re able to find, hire, and keep long(ish) term.<p>7) Cultural knowledge and team cohesion matter, you can&#x27;t simply put a $$$ on it. High profile developers leaving because of semi-public conflict with the company will have a ripple effect and you will probably lose several more lower rung developers who look up to the lead guy because of it. People matter and don&#x27;t always act simply because $$$ are on the table.<p>============================================================<p>Boredom is a sign of lack of motivation and purpose. The individual in question does not see their interests and corporate interests being aligned and thus has little intrinsic motivation to continue working beyond the bare minimum. As your lead developer, this should worry you significantly because their attitude will trickle down to the rest of the development team. Simply firing them sends the message dissent in the ranks isn&#x27;t tolerated and people who don&#x27;t keep with the party line get canned, it&#x27;s a fast way to lose talent and the fallout won&#x27;t be insignificant. In one of your comments you argued that all great developers need is a high salary, that&#x27;s patently false--as the comments here indicate. In psychology speak, this is what&#x27;s happening.<p>Only providing a high salary--and removing things like 20% time--are creating an environment where the only motivation to do work is extrinsic (the paycheck) and the loss of autonomy (no say in features/implementation/direction) means employees start believing they are losing their locus of control over even small things. Over time, this erodes their intrinsic motivation and interest in doing the work because they perceive the company views them simply as drones who do nothing except what the people &quot;in the know&quot; say. Is this correctable? The answer is yes, providing the company makes some substantial effort to address matters both immediately and long term for all the developers. First, simply throwing cash and trying to extrinsically motivate people to like things isn&#x27;t enough, if you want truly excited workers you need to work on aligning corporate and personal objectives. You do this by giving them a sense of autonomy and control where they feel they have a say in how things are going and get some skin in the game. You can start simply enough by soliciting your lead developer&#x27;s feedback and getting them involved in production meetings where feature sets are being decided. Lean on their expertise and seriously consider what they say and solicit their suggestions for features or improvements. Second, consider setting higher level objectives for development and letting developers/designers come up with the plan to meet them. You still get your business objectives accomplished, but the developers and designers feel like they&#x27;re contributing something more substantial than punching someone else&#x27;s schedule. Third, come up with a way to reward service and talent that allows people to explore and get a sense of autonomy. Many have mentioned 20% time where the developer works on other projects. that&#x27;s one aspect. The other might be to ask the developer to undertake a solo R&D project where they flesh out a new system the business has been planning on or version 2.0 of the product. Anything that gives them a sense of autonomy and ownership. It&#x27;ll go a long ways toward helping cure the problem. Perhaps also create a sabbatical program. After 1 year of &quot;work&quot;, employees get a month of R&D time to explore new technologies and projects on the company dime after they reach &quot;lead&quot; rank or something like that. There&#x27;s a reward for longevity and experience.<p>Corporately, what the heck are you doing? Simply throwing cash at people doesn&#x27;t get them to stay for the long term. They need to buy into a vision and believe you want them to succeed. It&#x27;s a reciprocal relationship. The few comments you&#x27;ve posted in some of the comment threads here leads me to think--and I freely admit I could be wrong--you see developers more as Pavlovian conditioned cogs who exist fulfill some greater business destiny and happen to reside in human form rather than people capable of contributing to the organization. For instance, yanking things away because &quot;business objectives aren&#x27;t being met&quot; (paraphrase). Hiring someone with the promise of benefit X (20% time in this case) and then yanking it will lead to resentment and boredom. If your lead developer is saying he&#x27;s bored, it&#x27;s a guarantee others are thinking it but not saying it out loud or voting with their feet--yet. Promising to reinstate the benefit, possibly maybe at some near future point, only makes thing worse because it makes you look arbitrary and capricious as well as reactive. You took it away, might reinstate it, and might yank it again in the future. If you&#x27;re doing it with 20% time, what else might you do it with?<p>In light of this, my question is how did you communicate with developers about the 20% time and how are you communicating with them now? Did you talk to them and say &quot;guys, we have a problem we need to solve together. We need to up product performance by X and right now we&#x27;re at Y. Y&#x27;all are in the trenches and building this thing, how can we work together to get there?&quot; Or did the conversation go &quot;Guys, product performance is at Y and we need to get to X. Blah blah blah sacrifice for the team blah blah blah, cutting 20% time to free up more time to focus on product blah blah blah together we can achieve this. End Transmission.&quot;? The reason is that perceptions matter. One method of communicating tells the development team you view them as a stakeholder who has insights you do not and might have solutions to the problem you hadn&#x27;t thought of. &quot;Geeze boss, we&#x27;re blowing a lot of man hours on a couple cosmetic features not related to the current problem. If we suspend that work, we can reorient the teams like so, get so many more people involved and chunk up the workload more efficiently.&quot; Then you can have a dialogue about the importance of the features, business objectives and such so that everyone reaches happy conclusion. Conversely, sending the message about pulling benefits--that were probably advertised when you hired--sends the message you see the developers as a machine you reward or punish for effort and nothing more. Over time, this mentality results in people being ground down and believing they aren&#x27;t valued. As soon as they reach that realization they&#x27;ll quit and move somewhere else meaning you&#x27;ll have major turn over in your development department and lose a massive amount of corporate knowledge in the process.<p>Edit: Formatting",1426705541

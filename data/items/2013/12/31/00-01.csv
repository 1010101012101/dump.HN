6988256,comment,6985717,6987884,2,0,Theodores,,,"True, a lot of time was spent prolonging an unhappy life or at least trying to postpone the inevitable. However he was pleased to receive the company of friends. To say &#x27;here you go, gun/pills in top drawer, help yourself!&#x27; is a betrayal of life, one would be breaking ranks with every sentient being that has life force and believes living is an ideologically sound thing to do. Yet, you are right, with hindsight, it would have been better for my friend if I had just helped him do the deed.\nAs well as &#x27;failures&#x27; there are &#x27;success&#x27; stories. At university I had the fortune of sharing a house with a deeply suicidal man, to discover there really weren&#x27;t the resources at the university to handle that. As well as practical help (hospital, cleaning up blood-stained things) we found another path for him, to sort it out with his folks, funding bodies and his department. He quit university rather than top himself, recovered from his depression and the following year he gave university another go. I did wonder how far a &#x27;cry for help&#x27; could go, he broke his leg jumping off the side of the bridge, not the middle, the cutting went a long way too, but not all the way.<p>Regarding gun culture in the USA, I can see the appeal, and, what would the West be without guns?<p>However, I also lived in an inner city area in the UK where there were guns and I thought the crime aspect of the area was &#x27;cool&#x27; and that it was great to live &#x27;on the edge&#x27;. Then I got beaten to a pulp - no gun, just knife - and, after that my perspective changed totally. I was no longer aloof from the shootings, wife beatings and drug related crime that went on.<p>Sometimes you need direct experience to have illusions challenged. To me US gun culture is a bit like that, it is easy to have illusions about how guns are this or that, we rarely hear the opinions of those that have been shot.<p>Now if you Americans could just get on with forming militia and driving up to Washington to dispatch that government of yours... Really, if that is what the guns are for, how much more provocation is needed?",1388451501

I was responding to the idea that all products must be secure, even for users who do not want to pay for the added security. Also, it is not so much that I think a service should offer a discount for handling your data insecurely (although in this particular case, the insecure handling is actually cheaper on a per user basis). Rather, there is a place in the market for products that are not secure, and therefore do not have to pay to develop and maintain the security aspects of the service.",1388451299

I had a 50% scholarship towards one of THE top electrical engineering schools in the country (not MIT, but you&#x27;d be in the right state if you were guessing), and I toughed it out for four years. Due to financial aid f&ckery, I made the choice to drop out with around half a year of credits to go to complete my BA.

If I had to do it all over again, I would&#x27;ve skipped college entirely, gone straight into the &#x27;failed&#x27; consulting business, and taken the extra four years of earnings instead of the staggering amount of debt.

Instead it states some bizarre equivalence between the decline in the number of hijackings (-6.9) and the increase in the number of instances of other kinds of terrorism (+6.8). But clearly other forms of terrorism do not cause nearly as much death as plane hijackings do, which for each one numbers in the hundreds, so we could be talking about an integer factor decrease in the number of deaths from terrorist attacks - 4x, 5x, 6x - by merely replacing them with other, less destructive terrorism. After all, the relative destructiveness of a plane hijacking is WHY terrorists do it at all. Suddenly airport security seems to look a lot more effective and a lot more worth it.

Furthermore, anything that <i>should</i> be 2 or more components is rather unlikely to <i>also</i> require exactly the same kind of split for error handling.

Not the worst mess in the world, to be sure, but error handling just isn&#x27;t the way that I want to be forced to architect my system.

Instead of peer review, in which experts check the work of other experts, media has editors and fact-checkers. Often, those people are not experts in the matters their institutions are covering. Worse, sometimes they are novices on subjects ranging from climate science to jet propulsion to even basic statistics.<p>But they still get to control the headlines on those stories. They still serve as the major conduit through which the public is informed about what are often intrinsically complex but extremely important matters. And even with strong editing standards in place, it is inevitable that some of the reporting for which they are responsible will lack crucial nuance or just be plain wrong.&quot;</quote><p>I don&#x27;t get the sense that the reporter was trying to mislead, but she was doing what reporters always do; twist what was happening into a narrative that they had concluded existed before they began researching and writing the piece. Something contradicts what you have to say? Discard it, and search for something that fits your story. Just like when you would write an essay in college; you&#x27;re making a claim, and backing it up.<p>The same is true of events. Creating a story by asking some people questions and trying to bind their responses into a single narrative with one story that makes sense is often-times impossible. Not because the reporter is doing a bad job, but because their task is impossible. The war in Syria is often shown as two warring factions, when in reality there are dozens of groups who play off each other and fight against each other at different times. Even the armies themselves are trying to piece together who is fighting for and against whom today; to expect a reporter to do so is absurd. But that’s exactly what we do.<p>How, then, can we have any hope of gaining a definitive understanding in the world, if even people paid to do so full-time have difficulty grasping it? Maybe there isn’t any. Life isn’t simple, people aren’t just good or evil, and situations are never binary. Maybe we’re not ever supposed to look at what’s happening in the world and say, “I understand now; it’s simple.” Because it’s not.

Keynes rather than Adam Smith.  To wit, Keynes wrote in the <i>General Theory</i>:<p>> It is better that a man should tyrannize over his bank balance than over his fellow citizens.<p>Smith, on the other hand, was very clear in advising the government against the conspiracies of businessmen and against viewing rising profits as a sign of national wealth:<p>> &quot;His employers constitute the third order, that of those who live by profit.  it is the stock that is imployed for the sake of profit, which puts into motion the greater part of the useful labor of every society.  The plans and projects of the employers of stock regulate and direct all the most important operations of labor, and profit is the end proposed by all those plans and projects.  But the rate of profit does not, like rent and wages, rise with the prosperity, and fall with the declension, of the society.  On the contrary, it is naturally low in rich, and high in poor countries, and it is always highest in the countries which are going fastest to ruin...<p>> &quot;Their superiority over the country gentleman is, not so much in their knowledge of the public interest, as in their having a better knowledge of their own interest than he has of his.  It is by this superior knowledge of their own interest that they have frequently imposed upon his generosity, and persuaded him to give up both his own interest and that of the public, from a very simple but honest conviction, that their interest, and not his, was the interest of the public.  The interest of the dealers, however, in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public.  To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always in the interest of the dealers...<p>> &quot;The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never to be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.  It comes from an order or men, whose interest is never exactly the same with that of the public, who have generally an interest to deceive and even to oppress the public, and who accordingly have, upon many occasions, both deceived and oppressed it.&quot;<p><i>Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Chap.

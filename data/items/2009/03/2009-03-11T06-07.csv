It just seems to me that eventually the money for these sort of unsustainable --- well intentioned investments in green technology will go away.<p>I.e. it appears there is a lot of hype, and a lot less real substantial progress.  Obama's new green jobs, are only really beneficial to the economy if they actual reduce our dependence on foreign oil (we are the larges consumer of oil in the world) at the same rate that china increases it's need for oil, so that the price of oil stays high even if the US isn't buying it.

You mention, 'minority group', but if you change that to 'the rich' (for a good definition of the word), the answer becomes imo that the rich can afford to pay more tax if they stop spending so much money.

To receive it you have to do so many hours of community service after a number of weeks, which minimises abuse of the system. But then we also have free medical if you need it to. If you're really on the skids the government will provide housing even.

511370,story,,,1,2,bcx,"Ask HN: What's the best way to break up charges for recurring billing?",,"I recently had a conversation about the best way to do recurring billing.  We identified a few pros and cons for a variety of approaches.   I am interested on the HN take. (NOTE: This is technology agnostic, and more of a conceptual discussion)<p>1) Prorated First Month, all recurring clients are billed on the first.
+ Cash flow at the beginning of the month
+ Cash flow lines up with bills.
+ Easy to do maintenance on recurring billing system (only runs once a month)
+ Reasonably easy for users to understand
- small partial month transactions for people who order late in the month.<p>2) Prorated 1st month with 2nd month prepay
+ (all of the above)
+ Even more cash flow early on, as every client is always one month ahead on payments
- some clients might not want to prepay for 2 months at once
- bill might be different then what the expect to pay, i.e. signup now for $15 costs them $29 (if they order on the 2nd of the month)<p>3) Everyone is on a 31 day cycle
+ everyone charged a flat $15 for every charge.
- Billing period slowly shifts around, not the same day every month
- cash flow spread out throughout the month
- harder to do maintenance, as billing must run every day<p>Other ideas:
4) Only Annual
+ large amount of cash on hand
- might scare away new users<p>5) Instead of prorating first month, call it a trial period, that starts 'now' and ends whenever your billing cycle begins.
- confusing to end users
- lost revenue due to trial<p>What is 'your' take? (your.. the collective HN)",1236751984

Addressing it in a more permanent manner would probably require you to compromise on a lot more of your libertarianism than just offering more social assistance.<p>For example, a huge percentage of the homeless are mentally ill.  If we institutionalized them, which is a nice euphemism for ""confined them against their will"", they would no longer be homeless.  Are you willing to do that?<p>Another major portion prefer camps to shelters or traditional housing arrangements because they just fundamentally do not want to accede to societal norms like ""You should work for a living and pay rent"", and necessary prerequisites like ""In order to maintain that job, you will probably find it necessary to come in to work almost every day, and be sober for the duration"".<p>Empirically, a significant portion of the homeless population will trade comfort for autonomy.  Living in a shelter means a loss of autonomy, and some people prefer a largely-unsupervised tent or, in a pinch, the streets.  NYC used to have significant excess shelter space and tried to force it on a homeless encampment by Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.  The church and homeless advocates sued to protect the homeless' right to live outside of shelters.<p>So, again -- are you OK with agents of the state having to physically restrain people to get them into shelters?

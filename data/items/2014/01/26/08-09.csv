7124487,comment,7121268,7124388,8,0,VexXtreme,,,"> What I DO find offensive is you marginalizing gender issues by comparing them to your experience vacationing in Asia.<p>This comment pisses me off. Living in a foreign country and being marginalized is completely different from being a woman in the tech field in a first world western democracy. I get reminded of the fact that I&#x27;m different literally every time I leave my apartment and deal with another human being, whereas for you it happens when you open HN and see a joke about bros or something to that effect. I have literally been denied housing multiple times on the account of not being a local and that fact wasn&#x27;t even hidden from me. Do I care? Not really, I just went elsewhere and sorted it out. As I said, you can&#x27;t change people but you can choose who you deal with and how you perceive the world.<p>>We are, to use your analogy, white people living in Asia except there is nowhere else to live.<p>You are literally complaining about something that is a first world problem and completely blowing it out of proportion. People like you give female and minority tech workers a bad name. What employer wants to hire someone who is going to cause a shitstorm and potentially threaten with lawsuits every time someone cracks a well meaning joke. I for one would now be very wary of hiring you for the fear of you not tolerating other people at the office, or even worse, suing me and my company. Good job sister. You sound like tons of fun to be around.",1390726759

Since the &quot;denial of human rights&quot; we are talking about in this thread is over the use of the word &quot;bro,&quot; and the (to feminists) perceived social ostracizing of women as a result of the word existing, mentioning another minority well known for being socially ostracized isn&#x27;t exactly a stretch.<p>Also, please stop hating on the white het cis males. I may not be one myself, but they are my friends, and my allies, and I also don&#x27;t like seeing people treated poorly for the way they were born (having experienced too much of that myself).

IMO they should have been put out of business for the continued laundering of drug money that they did <i>for years</i>. And the &quot;responsible&quot; corporate officers should have all been thrown in jail. Just fining the bank (i.e. the shareholders) doesn&#x27;t do anything to punish the perpetrators.<p>However, it&#x27;s a fact of life that as people age, they become more vulnerable to scammers. Many old people are tricked into withdrawing cash from the bank at the behest of scammers. Whether it&#x27;s for roof repairs, or for driveway resurfacing, or to help a long-lost niece, older people are often victims of flimflam artists. This happens a lot. It&#x27;s on the news a lot. I personally know older people who were victimized by scammers. Unfortunately the article didn&#x27;t mention the ages of the depositors.<p>As the bank says in the article: &quot;we have an obligation to protect our customers, and to minimise the opportunity for financial crime&quot;.<p>So I do see HSBC&#x27;s point.

The reason I&#x27;d argued that &quot;you&#x27;re going to get offended, deal with it&quot; was because I felt that if I didn&#x27;t believe that, I&#x27;d be on the hook for every possible minor offense I might cause, and there&#x27;s no possible way that I could know of or predict all of them beforehand.  But eventually I realized that that&#x27;s not what people are asking: they just want you to understand that from the POV of someone marginalized, such comments <i>are</i> exclusionary, and to do your best not to make them in the future.  It&#x27;s not about censoring every possible utterance you might make in the future, it&#x27;s about self-censoring <i>this</i> one.<p>Nobody&#x27;s asking you to give up your identity.

That&#x27;s the difference between elections and revolutions - for the first, regular election process is enough, the second takes place when citizens lost their trust in the ability of power structures to support that process. And this loss happened in part because Yanukovich consistently escalated the situation - first by tryng to forcefully disperse initially tame and non-violent protest, second by pushing through unprecedented package of laws which violate basic rights of citizens. Of course, after that trying to buy off opposition leaders with deputy positions within existing power structures couldn&#x27;t go very well.<p>Yanukovich obviously lost control of the situation and lost consent of his citizens, and failed as a leader of the country - having a popular protest this massive and violent in the middle of the capital and now spreading to other places is not a result of the successful leadership by any measure.

Don&#x27;t try to articulate it or communicate it or define it. The idea will remain safely in your head - the only danger is that you won&#x27;t be able to access it. So, all that is needed is a trigger; a couple of evocative words will do.<p>But I think the underlying problem is not the attraction of new ideas, but the repulsion of the old. New ideas are fun; old ideas are hard work. And the more progress you make, the more discipline is needed to finish. I don&#x27;t think the answer is simple willpower, but seeing some meaning in the result - that this <i>needs</i> to be done... the world <i>needs</i> that first idea, and <i>it needs you</i>.

The way people help one another, the way they communicate, how unselfish everyone become, it&#x27;s really amazing to see.

Civilian police in Turkey infiltrated among protesters and used molotov cocktails while their colleagues took photos of them and they distributed that stuff to the media to make the protesters look bad. They watched hospitals so that protesters would be afraid to get medical help. Our PM also met with protesters just to save face. Hell, even the name of the pro government channel is the same (This was mentioned on the 70th photo.

It&#x27;s a constant presence in the history of lesser states, when the interests of superpowers collide with theirs, a practice as old as the &quot;Voice of America&quot;.<p>In practice, when you see sponsored foreign &quot;organisations&quot; working in some place to help &quot;bring democracy&quot;, just think &quot;change the regime to some puppet who will do us favours&quot;. Superpowers don&#x27;t do such things out of the goodness of their heart. That&#x27;s why you only see them in places like Ukraine and Iraq, and not, say, Arabia or Latin America dictatorships [1]<p>><i>BTW-Do you get your news from RT?</i><p>I don&#x27;t know about him, but I get &quot;my news&quot; from studying the political climate and being in the middle of decades of European and Eastern European history. And I&#x27;m not even Russian/Ukraine, I&#x27;m from EU.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, the protesters are genuinely believing that they are doing the right thing and fighting for change etc. It&#x27;s just that that&#x27;s a feeling that&#x27;s very easy to create and manipulate in people, selling them &quot;change&quot; and &quot;hope&quot; and offering them the same shit in a different package.<p>Quite like people thought this Obama guy was the &quot;Hope&quot; that would change everything once he gets elected, only to get mostly same-old, same-old.<p>[1] From Wikipedia:<p>Activists in each of these movements were funded and trained in tactics of political organization and nonviolent resistance by a coalition of Western pollsters and professional consultants who were partly funded by a range of Western government and non-government agencies but received most of their funding from domestic sources.[nb 2][2] According to The Guardian, the foreign donors included the U.S. State Department and USAID along with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the International Republican Institute, the NGO Freedom House and George Soros&#x27;s Open Society Institute.[34] The National Endowment for Democracy, a foundation supported by the U.S. government, has supported non-governmental democracy-building efforts in Ukraine since 1988.<p>Former president Leonid Kravchuk accused Russian oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, of financing Yushchenko&#x27;s campaign on 14 September 2005.[36][nb 3] Yushchenko denied Berezovsky financed his election campaign.[36] Financing of election campaigns by foreign citizens is illegal in Ukraine.[37] At first Berezovsky refused to confirm or deny Kravchuk&#x27;s allegations, but in November 2005 he did claim that indeed he had heavily financed the Orange Revolution.[38][nb 4]<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution#Involvement_of_outside_forces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution#Involvement_o...</a>",1390723486

Some unfortunate aspects of this culture include:<p>- Excessive drinking<p>- Objectification of women<p>- Fear/ridicule of homosexuals<p>- Practice of hazing rituals<p>- Cults of personality/Hero worship<p>Basically, role up all the regrettable, animal-like behaviors of immature, dishonerable men.

People do indeed believe in revolutions, and thinks by burning stuff that wealth will be made.<p>3 years later (Tunisian here), we found out that it&#x27;s not a revolution.

While the protests are legit, the outcome is not.<p>This made me a new opinion: You can have power over another entity by using damage (burning, and crashing stuff).

If you are feeling excluded it&#x27;s because you are choosing to feel excluded, not because anyone is deliberately trying to make you feel that way. I am a western person living in an incredibly exclusionary and xenophobic east Asian country and if I cared about every time I&#x27;m treated differently, I&#x27;d go nuts. And since I am a white person living among a bunch of Asians, trust me when I say that I get treated differently all the time. People often start acting differently when I enter the room, store clerks and waiters often treat me a bit different than the locals etc. And you know what? Most of that is not even intentional. It&#x27;s just the way humans are and that&#x27;s ok.<p>You can&#x27;t force people to give up every single piece of their identity and what makes them different in order to fit this new politically-correct bland mold of people who all act and think the same so that no one feels &quot;excluded&quot;. As humans we are different, diverse, have different types of humor depending on the geography, age, gender, subcultures etc. Being able to cope with that is part of being a mature, well adjusted person.<p>All this PC &quot;let&#x27;s-all-be-the-same-hold-hands-and-sing-kumbaya&quot; crap is getting tiresome. It goes against everything that makes us human, different and unique. If that&#x27;s the world you want to live in - fine - keep going with your crusade and feeling indignant every time someone shows a trace of uniqueness and being different. I for one refuse to live in such a suffocating colorless world. I love being different from other people because everyone is more interesting that way, and yet at the end of the day I can still find a way to relate to others.<p>The world owes us nothing. If you decide to take away positive aspects from your daily experiences, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll get. If you decide to feel miserable and angry when people don&#x27;t act the way you want them to act, then sadness and misery is what you&#x27;ll get.<p>Since I know that some blockhead is going to try to strawman me, I will preempt that by saying that I don&#x27;t believe we should start calling black people &quot;niggers&quot; or take away women&#x27;s right to vote. Just saying that if people manifest their diversity in a way that&#x27;s not harmful to others, there is no reason to get upset.",1390723243

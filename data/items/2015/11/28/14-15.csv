I know lots of homeschooled children who have plenty of attention-regulation difficulties, and on the other hand I know children who have attended school since preschool age who do just fine in focusing their attention. (I am a teacher and regularly meet young people in my math classes who began school attendance early.)<p>In most of these matters, family history makes a big difference.[1] Sure enough, the children I know who have the most trouble regulating their attention have parents who have difficulties with the same issue, although perhaps not so severe by adult age. The suggestion of the press release you kindly shared that not going to school as soon as is typical recently is a good idea is an idea that is plausible to me, but it will not entirely prevent ADHD.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/genomics/famhistory/</a><p><a href=""http://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/genetic#Causes2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/genetic#Causes2</a>",1448722448

The father has &quot;good buddies&quot; in the sheriff&#x27;s office, and has even pulled strings to get free or nearly free legal representation, while my sister and I are struggling to afford astronomical costs.<p>In the civil parenting time case that resulted from this, virtually any time there is an issue that could go either way, we get stuck paying for it. For example, if the criminal case itself creates a date conflict that requires a civil hearing to be rescheduled, the father and his attorney will push the issue as far as they can, unto the point where we just have to pay our attorney to write up a full motion for continuance, when it&#x27;s not our issue causing the rescheduling or anything.<p>So far, the judges and prosecutors have gone far, far out of their way to <i>avoid</i> placing strict penalties or punishments on this person, even so much so that it becomes the victim&#x27;s (my sister&#x27;s) financial burden just to see that minimal justice is preserved and that a somewhat morally congruent result is achieved.<p>So it bugs me that people want to jump on a bandwagon of counter-intuitive support for the side of those who are charged or accused -- there are many places where people go out of their way to be lenient towards people who truly do deserve more severe penalties, and this is often at the expense of regular citizens who have done nothing wrong.",1448721629

There are just too many things you can try, and your resources are limited.<p>StarCraft is a very, very deep game. It seems like it would be very easy to waste time on paths that lead to no real gains. And that rather than using interesting AI techniques, the most important thing might in fact be the StarCraft knowledge of the author. And how good they are at distilling the game down to the parts that is going to yield the biggest returns.<p>Also, StarCraft has very distinct early, mid, and late stages to the game. Focusing only on the early game, and going with a single strategy eliminates a ton of complexity. If you spend all your time on getting an all-or-nothing rush perfected, you&#x27;ve essentially &quot;skipped&quot; all the sophisticated techniques some of the other authors spent their time creating for the mid and late stages. In fact, it seems like some authors did just this and were quite successful.<p>But even an all-or-nothing rush has a surprising amount of depth, and perfecting that would be a quite a feat. The biggest thing being micromanagement/unit control and knowing what to target first (this is actually very hard). If you don&#x27;t perfect that, beating a pro doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be even remotely possible.<p>I was a huge StarCraft BW fan, and it&#x27;s the only game where I got to the point where I could sometimes hold my own against pro players. I&#x27;m tempted to try BWAPI. Creating a full bot seems like a huge amount of work that I probably don&#x27;t have time for, but creating a unit control AI sounds like it would be fun.

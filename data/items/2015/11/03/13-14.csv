10499283,comment,10483266,10498073,0,0,burntsushi,,,"> Every book on libertarianism I have seen was lot more interested in some sort of ultimate, axiomatic moral truth, rather than empirical evidence that libertarianism works (by whatever criteria) in the real world. Ayn Rand with her fiction is probably the best example, but Rothbard is IIRC not much better. Heaps of theory and little evidence.<p>Ayn Rand has always put me off. She is more in the &quot;got mine, fuck you&quot; end of the libertarian spectrum IMO. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of other libertarians are that way too.<p>I&#x27;ve personally always found Rothbard compelling. The axiomatic stuff is just a way to build a foundation, and there&#x27;s definitely lots of hand wringing there. But you have to start somewhere. Personally, I think it&#x27;s quite possible to disagree with those axioms and therefore reject any conclusions drawn from them. More to the point, I don&#x27;t see how this is specifically a condemnation of libertarianism. Any political philosophy relies on some axiom or another, e.g., social contract theory, which purportedly justifies our current system.<p>> I don&#x27;t think though society can even exist in such framework. I pretty much agree with what wfo wrote you above. Seriously, some empirical evidence for your position would help. It may even be in a form of computer simulation.<p>I kindly defer to the very first line in my very first comment:<p>> I am, at least, philosophically libertarian. <i></i>But I&#x27;m not an activist and don&#x27;t participate in electoral politics.<i></i><p>I&#x27;m not really sure there is much empirical evidence to be found here. The only way to really know for sure whether it will work is to convince a society that freedom is an ideal worth pursuing and then try it. My own personal hope is that it occurs peacefully over time via cultural and societal evolution. It might span centuries.<p>Once again, I note that we have once again swayed from the original point. You called out libertarians as being against helping others. Instead, you end your comment with, &quot;Ok, fine, I&#x27;ll just dismiss that and jump straight to: but but but I can&#x27;t possibly imagine how it will work.&quot; So? I don&#x27;t really know either. Why can&#x27;t we be content with not knowing stuff? I am. I am certainly content with not knowing how a free society would work. What I do know is that my belief that coercion is unethical is unshakable.",1446556532

It is located in the province of Papua in Indonesia near Puncak Jaya, the highest mountain in Papua, and it has 19,500 employees.&quot;[1]<p>I first heard of this mine when, 20 years ago, a friend of mine and I thought it would be &quot;fun&quot; to climb the highest mountain &quot;on the continent of Australia&quot; [2]<p>We rapidly realised that this would be near impossible due to political, and at the time (and indeed now), logistical reasons.<p>A few years later I read Tim Flannery&#x27;s &quot;Throwim way leg&quot; [3] which discussed the development of the mine, the road that accesses the mine, the conflicts that surrounded the mine, and the secrecy that enshrouds the mine.<p>To this day it&#x27;s <i>very</i> difficult to access Puncak Jaya (Carstensz Pyramid), mainly due to the fact that the mine operators don&#x27;t want people in the area. Historically it was the local tribes that presented the problem, these days it&#x27;s Freeport-McMoRan et al who present the problem.<p>The mine itself has been the subject of contentious investigation:<p>&quot;In 1995, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) revoked Freeport&#x27;s insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US. It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them. Freeport states that this revocation was based on a misunderstanding, the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg; the company later underwent an independent environmental audit by Dames & Moore, and passed.&quot;<p>Dames & Moore are a story unto themselves.

This has been pushed and sustained by Australian, US, UK, and European interests and has largely been ignored by the greater global community.<p>To see this latest environmental disaster receive so little press isn&#x27;t surprising at all considering the recent history of the area. This isn&#x27;t something that can be solely pinned on the Indonesian government, this is a horribly perfect example of international capitalism gone awry. The companies involved in profiting from these areas need to feel &quot;somewhat responsible&quot; (a slight understatement) for what&#x27;s happening here.<p>Sorry people, rant over.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasberg_mine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasberg_mine</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puncak_Jaya"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puncak_Jaya</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwim_Way_Leg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwim_Way_Leg</a>",1446555935

As long as you&#x27;re referring to a non-coerced transaction, each side agrees to the transaction because they receive more benefit from engaging in the transaction then not engaging in it.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re addressing the point I raised. Allow me to rephrase in case there&#x27;s some ambiguity. The quote I originally replied to indicated that income inequality was an affect of a high concentration of political power. Assuming it is true that income inequality derives from a high concentration of political power, then using political means to solve income inequality is not only futile but demonstrates either a misunderstanding of the cause of income inequality or a kind of Stockholm syndrome from those who advocate to do so.",1446555803

Having a disability is something that will require the company to accommodate and giving them the most lead time to do so seems like a professional courtesy. Should the wheelchair user wait until the day of the interview to tell the employer they&#x27;ll need an elevator? It also smacks of the old style &quot;You&#x27;re just like us!&quot; attitude instead of acknowledging that yes, people with disabilities have different needs.",1446555718

923869,story,,,6,11,lucifer,"Ask HN:  Technical founder startup share",,"I've been presented with an opportunity to help an aspiring entrepreneur take his idea from the idea stage to (a) demo and then (b) foundation code-base and initial launch system.  For (a) the cash strapped founder is offering an effectively insignificant sum that I may as well wave, and a somewhat more realistic sum (pending his successful demo-based vc funding search) for the initial code base + a 3% share.<p>Given my NDA obligations I'm not at liberty to delve deeply into the idea, but its possible to say that it is a non-trivial (but not rocket science) cross between a social system and a ubiquitous domain X, and that technology will necessarily play a key role in the operation and success of the enterprise.  The system will require a sophisticated backend and it is clear that market price for contract development of the system is substantially higher than what is on offer.  In sum, while there are other aspects to the business such as 3rd party affiliations and data acquisition costs, technology costs will be a significant chunk of this venture's operational costs.  (Marketing, should a non-viral path be chosen, is the only other immediate potential cost.  Company can be virtually operated.)<p>The original founder is entirely non-tech.  He seems intelligent but I'm not 100% sure if he is really up to the game of an internet startup (he apparently has been shopping a cost structure where 10% of his costs were for software ...), and that most likely his potential competitors (n.b. nobody seems to be doing what he is proposing!) will be techies.  In any event, in the course of the our ongoing conversations I have been giving him critical feedback outside of the mere technical aspects of his proposal, so I certainly think I would be making contributions beyond providing software.<p>Currently I am in a situation where I can minimize my expenses and go in Ramen mode for a few months and I think the idea is compelling enough.  So I am considering a counter proposal to join forces as the tech co-founder and bootstrap this venture, and seek outside investment at a subsequent stage where we have a functioning system and a founder team that covers the bases for the required expertise in running this business.<p>So.  There is a founder with a compelling and fairly unique idea.  He does not have funding as of yet.  He has worked out the process to some degree but I've been also giving him feedback on that front as well, but lets just say he has the idea snd processed worked out for the sake of the argument.  If a tech founder were to join, what should he reasonably look for in terms of percentages?<p>(Thanks in advance for your feedback and advice.)",1257432984

I was trying to reach a milestone at the end of September and I put in over 5500 hands on 9/30 alone in about 11 hours of play.<p>The only correction I have to your post is: <i>They're almost as good as the TV pros, but younger.</i> Most of the cash game Internet pros (and many of the tournament Internet pros) are much better than the TV pros (other than a select few like Ivey and Antonious, who also play online anyways) because the Internet pros have played so many hands and tirelessly gone over areas where they are losing money to improve. When you're playing 400-500 hands/hr, a small improvement in your game can mean a difference of over $25/hr for mid-high stakes players. Many of these players aren't ""TV pros"" simply because they make a better hourly rate playing online where they can put in 8x the hands in the same time span, or because they don't (yet?) have the bankroll to risk losing $100K+ on a single hand.<p>I'm sure you (gizmo) know all this, but I thought some of these points would be useful information for the HN reader who is less knowledgeable about the poker world.<p>Here's one more tangent point you might find interesting about deep stacks (<a href=""http://www.twoplustwo.com/magazine/issue56/Savage-Deep-Stacks-Good-For-Poker-Tournaments.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twoplustwo.com/magazine/issue56/Savage-Deep-Stack...</a>).

Of course this doesn't apply to cash games (which you were obviously referring to), but because of tournaments' increasing blind levels and the need to end after a period of time, deeper stacks at the beginning actually mean a more-pronounced lottery period later on.",1257432494

923821,comment,923214,923262,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Honestly his idea of how professionals play profitably in poker is pretty awful. To say that a pro's bets are merely probing for information to let him know when he is beat is a gross oversimplification. ""Betting for information"" is actually a common leak (a sub-optimality) in beginners' and even solid players' play.<p>Most bets (there are some exceptions, but they are very few) have one of two purposes:<p>1) To make a hand with good equity (the chance of winning if no one ever folded) fold, especially a hand that is currently beating your own.<p>2) To get value from a hand with worse equity that will call.<p>The best situations are where your bet is doing both. For example, if we raised preflop with 8-7 and are greeted with an A J 8 flop with 2 clubs, we can bet and get hands like 10-10 and 9-9 to fold, while hands like a flush draw or straight draw will call. We can bet sometimes on the turn against certain players and get all but an A to fold.<p>Contrast this with a situation where we have K-K on an A 8 2 flop with no draws. A LOT of bad players bet small here so that if someone raises (or even calls), they can assume they have the A and fold. This is a huge mistake. We're only folding out hands we beat, getting called by hands that beat us, and possibly giving a smart opponent a chance to bluff us off the best hand. It is much better to check and let an opponent with a hand like QJ hit a worse pair (or give someone with TT a chance to think he might have the best hand when the turn is a 9) so that we can make money from a couple bets. Furthermore we give aggressive opponents a chance to bluff at us.<p>When we bet for information, <i>our bet has no value</i>, therefore we make no money from it. When we instead bet for value (or to fold a better hand) we do make money (in the long run) from our bet.<p>This post got longer than intended, but seeing your comment get a few upvotes, I wanted to make sure that people didn't think his insights were <i>actually good</i>. The most insightful thing he said was:<p><pre><code>  Professional players are so much better\n  than amateurs that they can make a living\n  in many cases, becoming very very rich by\n  exploiting the difference between their\n  level of skill and the level of the people\n  they play with.\n</code></pre>\nDon't let yourself (meaning the reader, not necessarily the poster I'm replying to) be one of those amateurs too often ;). Beyond that, especially considering that he says, ""I can't play poker..."" I would definitely not take his poker insights very seriously. The parallels with entrepreneurship, however, are pretty interesting.",1257430737

It is not at all clear to me that there is an objective to literary criticism.<p><i>Being wrong about the kinds of subjects that the humanities touches on (e.g. relations between human beings) can also have real negative consequences, if you are not a robot.</i><p>We have been talking about literary criticism.  Some areas of the traditional humanities are clearly of great practical value at least in some cases.  I did considerable research into certain areas of history as military intelligence analyst at one time and it was of tremendous value.  Similarly, the study of languages is of obvious utility, and I have already provided an overview of why I see utility in art.  I do not see how a knowledge of literary criticism would help someone relate to human beings in general though and I do not yet understand any value to it other than to those who make their living at it.<p>I know you said that it has value to those who value it.  And there is certainly some truth to that, but that is circular and does not explain why.<p>* but the notion that critical and aesthetic judgments are ""meaningless"" is one that's been thoroughly discredited over the past 50 years.*<p>Could you provide a reference or explanation?  I am not at all trying to argue that they are meaningless, but that is far from obviously true.<p><i>gain, if you believe that, then you believe that there is something which has intrinsic value -- utility.</i><p>Actually I am saying that things which have utility have value because of that utility.  That is not precisely the same thing, though I will admit at that point I am splitting hairs.  I do take it as obvious (and you do not seem to disagree) that something which has utility clearly has value, but I do not see any intrinsic reason why anything without utility must have value.<p>Again, I personally believe from a Christian standpoint that there are such things, but it is not obvious to me.<p><i>In any case, it's not clear to me why someone looking at things from an atheistic viewpoint would choose utility as his yardstick for value. </i><p>I'm certainly not trying to say that they would.  What I am saying is that there is no obvious reason that they would value other things, while it is obvious they would value utility.",1257430714

Now the Taliban has it own channel on Youtube. That's why I say they're 4th-generation; this is high level information warfare and it has very successfully fulfilled the strategic goal of preventing the West from bringing its full firepower to bear.<p>Reagan bankrupted the USSR by forcing them to compete with Star Wars. Will the Taliban bankrupt us by forcing us to spend all our money on UAVs? Maybe not, but they can still make making war on them prohibitively expensive.",1257430665

It's talking about the positive network externalities involved in tech products, and the conclusions that you need to draw from that.  In other words, in some cases you <i>have</i> to go big, at least in terms of market share.  Think about eBay - everyone sells there because everyone buys there and vice versa.  Unless they shared data, it would be difficult/inefficient to have 100's of small eBays, whereas with a bug tracker, it's not really that big a deal if I use redmine and someone else uses JIRA and someone else uses spolsky's thing.",1257430631

The host chooses one of the remaining two doors at random and opens it, showing a goat. Should you switch doors if given the chance?<p>In the first example the hosts choice is either forced (if you chose a goat initially) or doesn&#x27;t make a difference (if you chose a car).<p>In the second example, the host <i>could have opened a door with a car</i> because he was choosing the doors at random. Given that he didn&#x27;t, your estimate of the probability that you have chosen the car should increase - in fact, it should increase to 1/2, and switching doesn&#x27;t make any difference.<p>To me, this is the really interesting thing about the Monty Hall problem - the knowledge and intentions of the host are important in the correct solution to the problem!

It&#x27;s a political office (even in the case of US attorneys who are appointees, they&#x27;re appointed by the administration, and that job is often a stepping stone towards running for a state AG job or some other political office) and the sad fact is that in many parts of the country there are more people who want to throw the book at people they perceive criminals than there are people concerned with proportionality or preserving the rights of defendants. In fact, most people are complete hypocrites about legal process and will cheerfully make completely opposite arguments depending who is int he hot seat and why.<p>So there&#x27;s a clear incentive for prosecutors to paint anyone they catch as some Moriarty-like crime lord and of course that makes great news copy - big number, cooperative prosecutor, astonished neighbors saying they never realized they were living next to a crime lord, all heavily edited for maximum emotional impact within the tight constraints of the &#x27;Action News&#x27; format (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_News"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_News</a> - the reason local TV news in the US is so awful is because it&#x27;s manufactured on a template rather than crafted in response to the facts of the story).<p>And of course, there&#x27;s no requirement to report the much less interesting (to most people) outcome of someone having their charges downgraded to a few months in jail and a fine. Because of the first amendment it&#x27;s difficult for defendants to keep their name out of the media pending the outcome of a trial (whenever courts put anything under seal news organizations tend to file suit to gain access while mouthing platitudes about &#x27;the public&#x27;s right to know&#x27;) and there&#x27;s no way to compel the media to give equally prominent coverage to defendants whoa re acquitted, exonerated, have charges downgraded and so on.",1417034754

It does not mean the work is without merit or doesn&#x27;t have large impact or benefits to society, rather it simply means the quality of the work has no value to the peer reviewers or to the journal itself.<p>* The peer reviewers are donating their time and generally getting nothing in return from reading the work other than seeing what other developments are going in in the field.<p>* The journal gets nothing from work itself. They are solely in the business of collecting author fees and fees from library.<p>In this context, I think it is accurate to describe most work as &quot;valueless&quot; to those involved in the system. This naturally leads to sloppy peer review and publishing practices.<p>What I would like to see is a system that makes all players have skin in the game for the quality of the work.<p>How to do this? One way would be a new kind of journal where everything published has to be patentable. The journal would pay for the patenting costs and the split any potential licensing fees with the authors/funding institutions in some way. Peer reviewers would be paid and/or get a small cut of the patent.<p>This would make everyone in the process have &quot;skin in the game&quot; in the value and quality of the work being published.

First, the Commission acknowledged that <i>an offender who commits five offenses, for example, deserves more punishment than if he commits one, but not necessarily five times the otherwise applicable penalty</i>. Consequently, the guidelines had to provide a mechanism for calculating incremental increases in punishment for multiple offenses. Second, if the guidelines based punishment on the number of offenses of which an offender was convicted, the Commission realized that formal charging decisions could have a tremendous impact on the resulting sentence. Consequently, the Commission had to create guidelines to limit the significance of formal charging decisions to ensure that similar defendants who engage in similar offense behavior will receive similar sentences.&quot;<p>In short, it supports both our positions, that multiple counts are taken into consideration for purposes of sentencing, but that the sentencing is stepped so that enhancement is not a 1 to 1 multiple.  That said I did not mean to imply multiple counts enhance sentences, but that where there is discretion, multiple counts would be used as a aggravating factor.",1417034142

When a company approaches a bank to make a trade, there is no relationship of trust and confidence between them (unless there&#x27;s some specific legal promise that says otherwise). Why do you think there is/should be? That page gives examples of people in such relationships: corporate officers, directors, employees, friends of employees, etc, who use a company&#x27;s private information to trade for themselves.<p>But when a company (rather than some privileged employee), approaches a bank, and reveals that it wants to make a trade, it has no special relationship with the bank.<p>Another thing is that the meaning of &quot;securities&quot; is quite specific, and doesn&#x27;t cover commodities. I don&#x27;t think this would be insider trading even with securities.<p>Yet another downside of very broad interpretations of insider trading is that if someone invests time and effort into studying market conditions, the resulting research is non-public, yet they would be perfectly justified in trading on their own non-public information. It is only specific cases of non-public information obtained through privileged access that are insider trading.<p>A bank having access to a company&#x27;s order flow by having that company reveal the flow to them is not engaged in insider trading, it&#x27;s just doing a good job of participating in the market and studying market conditions. Someone else who wants to buy/sell the commodities from the bank gets a better price as a result. If the bank didn&#x27;t have a good idea of the market conditions, it would offer worse prices to compensate itself for the uncertainty.",1417032968

Frequently, they are parthenogenic only under some circumstances--there is a parthenogenic species of fresh-water fish that responds to environmental stress by shifting over to sexual reproduction.<p>Purely parthenogenic species also have genetic tricks to play. There is a purely parthenogenic snake that is triploid (three copies of every chromosome instead of the more usual two) which likely allows it some more &quot;freedom of expression&quot;, genetically speaking.<p>So while you&#x27;re right that sexual reproduction is a huge evolutionary benefit, parthenogenesis is such a huge benefit to the single parent (it gets 100% of its genes into every offspring instead of a mere half!) that under the right circumstances it will be strongly favoured.<p>In the case of these termites, its only new queens that are the product of parthenogenesis, and it isn&#x27;t obvious that this is the only way new queens can be produced, so the typical limits are relaxed.",1417032251

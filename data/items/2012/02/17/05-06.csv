3602344,comment,3601687,3601998,2,0,Terretta,,,"> <i>Other factors like the ambiguity caused by sparseness must also be weighed.</i><p>The current pattern doesn't suggest weighing of anything. You marched the dots down diagonally, first sets of one, then two, and so on. You mirrored alphabetical order with numerical dot order.  You're now trying to justify that after the fact.  It's not credible.<p>It's too bad you're choosing to argue instead of seriously considering the surprisingly thoughtful feedback several others have given you here.<p>For example, my point about FITALY was obviously <i>not</i> about the stylus movement.  The similar dynamic isn't movement distance, the similar dynamic would be a statistical use of the legibility of adjacent dot columns.  My point was the research that went into Fitaly:<p><i>""These figures are obtained using a corpus of digraph probabilities similar to that described by Soukoreff and MacKenzie (1995)... We have measured the frequency of letter-to-letter transitions for a representative corpus of the English language with several millions of characters. For example, this produces the number of times the letter o is followed by the letter a.""</i><p>Given a dot matrix, there are a limited number of dot patterns.  It's straightforward to measure the legibility of those dot patterns to humans of normal visual acuity (using mechanical turk for example), then to mathematically derive a letter assignment that maximizes legibility across, say, the Brown Corpus.<p>That <i>would</i> be something interesting to see.",1329458129

3602340,comment,3601354,3601504,6,0,newbusox,,,"I agree. I'm sure there was a time not too long ago when merchants at local shops would know customers by name and learn their habits, and, possibly, be able to learn intimate details about customers by looking at what products they bought. If the merchant then recommended a product to one such customer based on those observations, that's good business. I suppose the translation from local town merchant to faceless corporation is something of a change (most notably because the corporation may be able to use this information for other/nefarious purposes), but, conceptually, it seems to be replicating the same behavior that doubtlessly has occurred in some form since people began selling products to other people. Instead of arguing that businesses have become more invasive of our privacy, you could also argue that we have simply become more protective (or aware of) our privacy in recent years, which is why this seems like a big problem to a lot of people.",1329458013

3602337,comment,3601204,3601204,5,0,CmdrKrool,,,"Two concerns.<p>Say you've made a bunch of apps and you are signing them and one day Apple judges that one of them is nefarious and revokes your developer key. Does that mean that /all/ of your apps will now fail to run in the ""signed apps only"" mode, rather than only the nefarious one? If so that's more punitive than the iOS App Store, where I've heard of individual applications being taken down but never of a developer itself being black-balled. (Will you be able to apply for another key? Will you have to play identity games to try and pass yourself off as another person?)<p>Secondly, I've said above that an unsigned app will no longer ""run"", which is what the language on the Panic blog implies. Will it really check the validity of the developer's certificate every time a program is /run/? Will you be happily using someone's app one day, and then the next day find it doesn't start up anymore because some other app from the same developer which you might have no interest in or knowledge of has been judged to be bad? That doesn't sound very user friendly. I mean, I would have assumed that such a check would only apply at /install/ time, rather than run time, but everything I've read so far seems to be leaning towards the latter.<p>(Sorry - doing a quick check before posting this of Gruber's article - which I hadn't actually read yet - seems to confirm that both of my concerns are real.

3602292,comment,3601513,3601513,1,0,CyberFonic,,,"I pretty much agree with much of what you wrote.  But feel compelled to point out a couple of things.<p>Unix was initially widely used on DEC computers - PDP 16 bit and then VAX for 32 bit versions.  DEC management were less than impressed so they scrambled to improve on Unix and released VMS.  The key designer of VMS was lured by Microsoft and thus NT came about.  Once you strip away the GUI, a lot of Windows server is quite a bit like Unix.<p>In the world of heavy duty servers, Unix and its many derivatives were there first - by a long shot.  The key players were Sun - Solaris / SunOS, IBM with AIX and HP with HP/UX.  More recently IBM have been building super-clusters using Plan9 which is a descendent from Unix and created by same guys.  The increasing performance of x86 multi-core CPUs and the freedoms of GNU/Linux effectively negated the early advantages of the proprietary Unix based systems and that is the core reason for their decline, not any competitiveness from Windows server.<p>Windows Server won a lot of support because it was <i>easier</i> to click around on a GUI than to remember commands.  Of course, the real Windows gurus use command line stuff and scripts.  But they are the minority when it comes to Windows sysadmins.<p>The vast majority of big systems, think Google, Amazon, et al. use Linux systems.<p>Now for a fun fact.  Back in the 1980s, when Microsoft only had MSDOS, they actually licensed Unix from AT&T and sold it as Xenix.  Once Windows gained a foothold, they sold Xenix to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) who marketed it quite vigorously through the later 1980s and 1990s.  A lot of office servers ran Xenix on IBM PC/AT hardware - some tricked out with larger disks and extra memory cards.<p>You have to wonder how things would have panned out had Microsoft kept Xenix and wrapped their Windows GUI around it.  That same strategy worked out pretty well for Apple with OS-X which is Mach/BSD at the core with a very nice GUI on top.",1329456519

Pregnancy just happens to be a very vulnerable time for consumers to start new shopping routines, and that's why it received so much analytic focus.<p>It's a travesty that Forbes glosses over this point.  The data mining isn't too surprising, and a habit of shopping at Target is what keeps making them money long after the baby has been born.",1329454949

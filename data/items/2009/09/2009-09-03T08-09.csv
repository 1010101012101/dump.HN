In the end it's about someone's point of view and their responsibility to it. I've come across someone who claims to be a jack(or rather master)-of-all trades: has a degree in CS and an MBA and has worked in Sales, CTO, R & D. Says he's not an ordinary freelancer and builds end-to-end systems and uses PHP for the client and also Python on the server (has good reasons for it), whilst also promotes his own version of cloud computing. I have a background in Information System so am not quite the gung-ho programmer or engineer, but am still able. I sort of want to put something out as sexy as possible that works really well. I'd happily micromanage some monkeys to get it right, or give an engineer more free reign. I'm still undecided. But yes, long term, if it's successful, the system needs to be engineered really well, eg Craigslist. Twitter might have been a quickly cobbled together RoR app initially.<p>edit: don't know anything about DHH or Katz.",1251968322

I suspect this to be particularly true of non-software industries.<p>The design processes that would go into the development of a global patent system would likely re-examine and re-evaluate the principals, successes, and failures of many existing patent systems around the world. In all likelihood, the resulting system would be sufficiently less painful to justify tolerating the inherent problems with patent systems for many more years to come.",1251968227

Maybe I feel like this because I've been burned by not using control version system a long time ago.

Switzerland has stricter privacy laws which allows people to evade taxes easily. The problem is, the swiss still pay their taxes even though they aren't forced to – and there are numerous studies suggesting that not forcing people to do something actually works better. I can completely understand nations who want the swiss to close this loophole.<p>Recent events, this was confirmed a friend managing relations with the U.S. at a big swiss bank, made a lot of people rethink whether they still want to keep their U.S. passports and are getting rid of them.

This means that a wealthy individual who owns US property or stocks & bonds and spent some time in the US now has to pay up to 45% of estate tax in the U.S. on his U.S. property. Just because you own German stocks, should Germany get access to  all your financial accounts and be able to freeze the assets when you pass away to determine if you should be taxed in Germany? This is absolutely ridiculous and as they mentioned in the letter, the additional tax revenue will not create enough tax revenue to solve the problems of the U.S. That's why they are suggesting that their clients should withdraw from investing in the US, because that 2 month vacation in California suddenly means, that they'll take 45% of your Apple shares when you pass away.",1251965019

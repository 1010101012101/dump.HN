975416,comment,975193,975193,0,0,dasht,,,"Dang, that's nice.  Depicted in the video are several shots of Berkeley, CA where I live.  I gave up owning a car a few years back and use a bike for most everything.  I make pretty heavy use of our Bicycle Boulevards.<p>FWIW, here are some observations of things that commonly go wrong with these systems:<p>One of the most important Bicycle Boulevards (hereafter, B.B.s) in Berkeley is shared by spill-over traffic from a car boulevard because of the absence of traffic-calming diverters.  The absence of diverters occurs because the self-same street is the main car route to the high school and to City gov't offices.   One of the huge negative side effects is that, because of the heavy car traffic (no matter how polite the cars and bus traffic is) the pavement is perpetually in horrible, life-threatening shape for cyclists.   Either that street needs diverters or the B.B. needs pushed aside one block.<p>Another weird problem with the B.B. concept is that on the one hand we teach drivers that cycles are subject to the same rules of the road as cars.... and on the other hand, B.B.s create situations where, for example, bikes can turn left but cars can not.   In my experience, this upsets and confuses a small but significant subset of drivers.   In one recent encounter a couple (otherwise quite nice, I'm sure) went out of their way to menace me with their car, roll down their windows, and shout at me about traffic law after I made an otherwise perfectly safe and legal turn.<p>In a similar incident, I was once balled out by a driver for not using the ""bike lane"" on a B.B., for one block, where there was distinctly no bike lane.  I probably delayed her trip by about 15 seconds.  She doubled that in the time she paused to chew me out.   More commonly, there angry drivers who will tailgate and menace cyclists on B.B.s, looking for a chance to edge around the cyclist and cut them off at close quarters.   If I could afford it, I would probably ride with a video camera mounted on my bike to have these folks cited.<p>That said, the B.B. situation in Berkeley mostly works and I want to give some of the other side of the story:<p>One phenomenon that really, really hurts the B.B. infrastructure yet is far too common are Idiot Cyclists who, themselves, abruptly cut off cars, blow off stop signs or red lights, and menace pedestrians.  The I.C.s have what's coming to them but its the fall-out impact of them on responsible riders that really bugs me.<p>One trick I've learned that sounds ever so obvious in retrospect yet that not enough people do?  If you are a cyclist, LEARN AND USE HAND SIGNALS and BE LIBERAL WITH FRIENDLY NODS / WAVES OF THANKS TO CONSIDERATE DRIVERS.  Many, many (maybe most) drivers seem to greatly appreciate the cyclist who is both unsurprising and appreciative of common courtesy.  If you think cycling in urban environments is important, go out of your way to socially reinforce good car driving.<p>Another trick I've learned is that, when it matters for your safety (really matters) - don't be shy about ""taking the lane"".  Sometimes, shoving yourself towards the side of the road is far too risky compared to putting up with an annoyed driver behind you for a block or two.<p>Another trick - amazingly under-practiced by cyclists in Berkeley - is RIDE WITH AMPLE LIGHTING AND REFLECTION from dusk to dawn.   The number of uncomfortable near accidents I've had with cars is comparable to the number of uncomfortable near accidents I've had with Idiot Cyclists who speed, ignore stops, dress in dark clothes, and ride in poor lighting with no lights.<p>Also, wear a damn helmet!",1259881093

My guess is it's probably not Google or why would they offer an alternative? It sounds like a very clever way to attack their online advertising competition to me. Obviously they'd get into some hot water by trying to compete directly with their own advertising based DNS. Instead they attack the entire market of re-direct/ad DNS by offering a clean alternative that happens to hurt their competition. Very clever.

The ""legitimate buyers"" (I assume you mean people who wish to consume housing) could have continued to rent.""</i><p>The cost of renting went up along with the boom and unsurprisingly went down with the bust. Everyone was forced to pay more except for those who already owned a home.<p>Where do you think the leasers got their homes? Do you think that they wouldn't raise their prices when other options were priced much higher?<p><i>""Most of the people who bought houses are also scalpers; they bought a house in the hopes that it would be worth more later. ""Real estate never goes down!""""</i><p>Hindsight is 20/20. During those economic conditions, you could either rent overpriced accommodations, or you could take out a mortgage with a lower % interest than how much homes were appreciating yearly. This was a ponzi scheme where the timing of the bubble was controlled by the financial giants' tolerance for risk.<p>If you did not join in this fiasco, you risked losing purchasing power compared to everyone else. This is equivalent to you putting your money in a 0% interest account while everyone else puts it in a 5% interest account. I am willing to bet that the majority of the people here did not know when the bubble was going to burst, including most of you who are now saying that ""those dumb speculators shouldn't have bought a home back then"" (see how this is bad for liquidity if you can't buy a home for 3-4 years?).<p>Scalping is also theoretically bad for the market. The market is not optimal when buyers are paying the maximum amount. In such a condition, you have decreased liquidity as buyers are forced to buy less since everything costs most of their money. You might just buy food and shelter, and try to be self sufficient on everything else. This is not conducive to a vibrant economy.<p>The market is optimal when sellers are selling at their minimum amount. The ideal market thrives on competition. Liquidity is increased and you have incentives to use the extra money to drive other sectors of the industry.<p>Take for example text messaging. It doesn't even cost 10 cents per message, and people would even pay 20 cents per message. But does that mean a text message is truly worth that much? Absolutely not! The phone company has lost that much interest into improving their existing services rather than trying to extract as much as they can from their consumers. Artificial scarcity only helps businesses/scalpers take advantage of the consumers.",1259877902

We use Spreedly, but I like both.<p>If you wanted to be really, really cheap, the best course is probably to take something like Ubersmith or Modernbill and bend them to your will.  They're both designed for hosting companies, but can be contorted into other business without too much effort.  Both have 1 time license fees that aren't insane.<p>Even the most expensive option (Spreedly) is $12k/year.  If you're billing $10k customers even $5/mo, that's really not much money.",1259877855

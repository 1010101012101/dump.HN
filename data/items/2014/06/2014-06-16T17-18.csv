My <i>sigh</i> was because every time somebody brings up something in the US that needs to be changed or reformed, you can bet that some European will come in and say, &quot;As a European, I&#x27;m shocked this is like this!&quot; As if we all got in a room and decided that whatever the thing is was the right thing to do, and it all sounded like a good idea at the time. In reality, these things, especially laws, go through complex histories, compromises, concessions, and interests. I gave an overly brief history of the alcohol laws in the US, or at least their influences. Just to give a <i>little</i> context.<p>In reality, this discussion should be around regulatory capture. But that&#x27;s too hard, so instead, we get into a Europe vs US pissing match. It&#x27;s stupid. It&#x27;s foolish. So, instead of discussing how to better fight regulatory capture, we just try to show off how special we are. I say again: <i>sigh</i>.",1402941574

7900468,comment,7899376,7900136,12,0,chimeracoder,,,"> These purposes aren&#x27;t, on their face, unreasonable. Taxis generate undesirable congestion, and establishments that serve liquor tend to create undesirable drunk people. If you don&#x27;t believe me, take a walk through Wrigleyville in Chicago on a Friday night, where you can see an endless parade of taxis picking up an endless parade of drunk students.<p>I agree that sometimes this setup (licenses to restrict supply) make sense, but taxis are not a good example of where this provides a net benefit.<p>I&#x27;d rather have a bunch of taxis than a bunch of drunk college students driving. Furthermore, from a city planning perspective the most efficient use of both road space and real estate (parking) is to have cheap, on-demand taxis instead of personal car ownership. <i>If</i> public transportation is fairly extensive and always available (as it is in NYC), it makes sense to eschew personal ownership of cars and use taxis for the rare case when public transportation isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Overall, this <i>reduces</i> congestion, and is one of the reason that taxis are oftentimes taxed less (or pay less in tolls) than personal, non-commercial vehicles.<p>In fact, I posit that a significant reason that services like Hailo and Uber exist in NYC specifically is that the supply of on-demand taxis is heavily restricted[0]. If the supply were left up to the free market[1], Uber and Hailo would be able to provide some added value (the convenience of the mobile app and the &quot;premium&quot; feel), but not the level that they are now.<p>[0] Since the 1970s, the number of medallions available has not increased commensurately with the increase in population<p>[1] but with the same laws regarding nondiscrimination of service with respect to destination, credit cards, etc.",1402941557

I&#x27;ve only used instacart a few times, but I could immediately tell it was way better than Safeway&#x27;s delivery mechanism.<p>For starters, I could have a single watermelon delivered at 11pm for a party I had going on, but with Safeway, I could not do same day delivery and it would need to be delivered during working hours the following day because the other times were already booked.  Safeway&#x27;s delivery mechanism is probably good enough for large offices that need regular deliveries, but Instacart is good for all other times.  I probably would just stick with a single delivery service for everything so I wouldn&#x27;t waste my time using Safeway&#x27;s service.<p>Instacart feels very similar to Google Shopping Express, and if you haven&#x27;t tried out either service, you should definitely try one of them out.

7900456,comment,7897105,7897512,2,0,neltnerb,,,"There aren&#x27;t really formal bonds being broken transitioning from liquid to gas, but I suppose it is fair to say that the supercritical state will transition more quickly to steam than a subcritical liquid with enough energy to become steam at atmospheric pressure.<p>The reason for that would be that there is a nucleation process in forming gas from liquid, which does take some time. Or at least more than not needing to do so.<p>There is some terminology you&#x27;re using that bothers me, like &quot;flash into steam&quot; isn&#x27;t really a good way to describe it. At that point you&#x27;d be better off describing it as &quot;super pressurized steam&quot; converting to &quot;normal pressure steam&quot; or something. It&#x27;s just expanding, but there is no flash (which to implies a sudden change). It&#x27;s gradually and continuously decreasing in density.<p>I think part of this may be confusion over how we overload the word &quot;water&quot; to mean &quot;liquid water&quot; as well as &quot;water the chemical&quot;. I am meaning &quot;water the chemical&quot; which can be a solid, liquid, or gas. Steam is water that is a gas.<p>With a supercritical system, you can take liquid water, stay in the liquid state until the water becomes supercritical (where the liquid and gas phases are indistinguishable), and then move across a boundary from &quot;liquid like&quot; to &quot;gas like&quot;, go back into a sub-critical state as gas, and never formally boil/flash/etc.",1402941474

It&#x27;s really more of a coincidence that they are both called licenses, they permit you to do something (drive cars, operate a taxi service), but one certifies competence, the other merely conveys permission.<p>EDIT:<p>Perhaps of interest, I went to Prince Edward Island last year and met some fishermen. Apparently their licenses can be sold (they effectively take out a mortgage given the cost) and are used as a sort of retirement plan by the fishermen that own them. But they also (according to them so I&#x27;m not sure the precise legal considerations or if it&#x27;s convention) require that you spend some years working for licensed fishermen before you can purchase one. So sort of a hybrid between the driver&#x27;s license and the taxi medallion model.",1402941143

I understand the reason why Google has these restrictions: they have a lot of old C++ code and they try to play it safe, maintain the same code style, etc. However, the modern C++ is a much nicer language than it was 15 years ago. By imposing these restrictions, Google limits the developers productivity and quality of the code. I&#x27;ve had experience integrating large old C/C++ project into the modern C++ world and while it is not a simple task, it can be done with relatively low pain (the biggest challenge was related to making the code exception safe).",1402941100

Or maybe even more subtly, if they kept messaging and pestering you in online chat, suggesting you could see &quot;them&quot; (fake kid) naked for money, even though you expressed reluctance about it. <i></i>That did not happen here, these were just the super easy people who jumped easily and quickly at the opportunity to pay to have a child perform sex acts on video<i></i><p>Secondly, in every jurisdiction that I know of, this is the crime of Intent to Commit. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the avatar was virtual, it&#x27;s no different than an adult cop using picture of a model as bait. You aren&#x27;t interacting with a virtual chat bot, you&#x27;re interacting with an adult human being who happens to be using a computer-generated avatar. Again, this is no different than buying fake cocaine from an undercover cop, or attempting to steal a bait car.<p>Let us not forget that it is statistically improbable that even half of these 1000 people are doing this for the first time. Which means most of them have paid money to someone to force a kid to perform sex acts on camera, and so enjoyed the experience they went and sought it out again.<p>I think more police departments should have officers on staff and hackers as consultants to engage in consistent and ongoing honeypot operations, not just for these sorts of crimes, but also for things like online fraud, etc.",1402940979

Just good examples, or you&#x27;re thinking of making a game andwant some good examples?<p>Now, for inventory. You can have the <i>party inventory</i>, like in JRPGS or the <i>character inventory</i> like in Baldur&#x27;s Gate. Personally I prefer the <i>party inventory</i> because there is a lot less fiddly. But the other kind is more &quot;realistic&quot;. There is one game that mixed the two in a way that I enjoyed. You have a <i>party inventory</i> but each character has &quot;slots&quot; where you can put items to be used in battle. But in this case you don&#x27;t have the whole inventory available.<p>Then you can have an <i>unlimited inventory</i>, like in JRPGS, or a <i>limited</i> one. You can limit it in two ways: Limited <i>space</i> like in Diablo, or limited <i>weigth capacity</i> like in Skyrim. In my opinion you should never mix them both. It&#x27;s too fiddly, and too frustrating. In limited space you also can have item of diferent sizes. This is fun because inventory menagement becomes a sort of minigame (again, Diablo makes this pretty well).<p>With party control it&#x27;s a lot more complicated. If the game is turn based or if there is the option to pause the action, the player should have total control of all the mambers of the party. If it&#x27;s all real time, there should be an option to ssue orders. One game that does this well is Mount and Blade. You can issue orders to your troops including, IIRC, you could issue orders to the different kinds of troops. I feel this would be a nice addition to Skyrim, for example.<p>About status, I really liked what Final Fantasy VII did for status effects. If a character was nead death he would appear hunched, if confused he would have stars swirling around his&#x27;s head and if poisoned he would glow in green. If he were under all these status effects, we would show all three effects and they didn&#x27;t overlap or be in conflict with each other.<p>But, as I said in the previous post, it still depends on your objectives in the game. In pokemon you have direct control over your pokemons but I would like to see a similar game where you don&#x27;t have direct control and you have to train their AI.",1402940944

In the first quarter there were five famines, with an estimated loss of life of 1,000,000. During the second quarter of the century there were two famines, with an estimated mortality of 500,000. During the third quarter there were six famines, with a recorded loss of life of 5,000,000. During the last quarter of the century, what? Eighteen famines, with an estimated mortality reaching the awful totals of from 15,000,000 to 26,000,000.

7900370,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,tetsuk,,,"What happens after August? Does the internship end and your visa expires or were you able to secure yourself a permanent job in the US? The reason I ask, is because, if the time is limited, your options are even more so. Meeting people is one thing. Even having a fling or two is a very realistic possibility time-wise. But making friends or any friend at all that is worth half a penny, takes time. It could happen, but it is not something that you do or that you make happen. \nWe say we make friends, but we really don&#x27;t. We find each other, after lots of interactions with all sorts of people. There is beauty in it, but in reality it&#x27;s usually quite messy. There&#x27;s no algorithm, no code, no debugging. There&#x27;s heated arguments, lighthearted fun, fights, all is game. But when you care about someone enough not to want to lose that person, and he/she also feels the same way, you know you have a friend (sometimes a partner). Friends forgive you if you are being an idiot. You usually have to apologize though. You put yourself out there and sometimes you get hurt or really mad. Other times, you just get to experience the wonders of true friendship.<p>But, I have to ask you (rhetorically), what have you been thinking? (And now the part where I answer my own question) I am making an assumption here so feel free to call me out on it, but my feeling is that you didn&#x27;t think making friends was really that important. You see something now, that maybe you didn&#x27;t before, and you suddenly want that.\nI had a conversation with a cousin of mine long ago, and he was smart (in school), but he didn&#x27;t have any friends. And so once I told him, to forget about lots of the idealistic stuff he had going on in his mind all the time, and to make friends, because there lies real value. That was very sad to see, but then again, that was his choice and we are accountable for the choices we make.<p>Now, I am not saying you are like my cousin, but I bet my right arm and leg that you had more than one chance during your stay in college or at work, to make friends. But you didn&#x27;t. So you really need to ask yourself why and not make any more excuses if you really want to change that.<p>As someone else suggested, at your age, most people have already made their friends and are not likely to invest in making new friends. Acquaintances sure, but for friends, that train is gone (mostly). But do you know why? It&#x27;s not because of a first come, stacking kind of logic, where once the stack is full, you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s because becoming friends with someone can be exhausting emotionally, and most people tend to have some resistance after twenty-plus years of trials and errors. It&#x27;s not the same with finding a partner, since people of all ages are looking for a partner, so that is actually much easier.<p>If you are serious about wanting real friends, be ready to work for two.<p>People you hang out with just when you feel like it, are not friends. They are more like acquaintances. Friends are those  people you hang out with even when you don&#x27;t feel like (in many occasions). I don&#x27;t want to turn this into a discussion about acquaintances and the different types of friendships though. All I am saying here is that you are not a friend with someone because it is convenient. I hope I could get this point across.<p>Next up: language. Honestly without hearing you speak, there isn&#x27;t much to say, but you can write fairly well. I am also guessing that you can understand everything people say to you when they speak. If that is the case, as long as you don&#x27;t speak in an incomprehensible way, people won&#x27;t care much. Still, it&#x27;s good to work on improving how you sound and to be both modest and confident. People tend to shy away from people who lack confidence (and from those with too much of it also, although not always).\nThere&#x27;s a book called American Accent Training, with a nice American flag adorning the cover! For Asians that talk in a non-flowing manner, it can be of great help.<p>BTW, conversation is not about how you pronounce something, but about what you do and how you do it. Listen and show genuine care, or to put it bluntly, &quot;give a damn&quot;. Learn to do this constantly. Don&#x27;t try to fool people. If your interest is not genuine, a real relationship will not come out of it.<p>Don&#x27;t give up ever, act, and things will happen. Maybe not tomorrow, but then it is just a matter of time, and time is still on your side.",1402940509

7900363,comment,7898035,7898035,5,0,araes,,,"Having suffered this, I will comment based on what I&#x27;ve done that I feel works.<p>- Join social groups.  I went on Meetup, local college sites, did Google searches for things I was interested in by area, went to logical hangouts for that stuff (gaming shops, hobby shops, maker hangouts, ect...)  If you are diligent, you will soon find yourself with more to do than you have time for.<p>- Rarely say no.  If you are hesitant or nervous about a social situation, particularly one w/ new people, ignore that and participate.  You will meet people much more slowly if you only accept social situations where you&#x27;re comfortable.<p>- Smile.  Many people have what I would describe as a non-approachable resting face (worried, mean, nervous, ect..). Folks who might talk decide not to because they expect you will respond poorly. People also interpret smiling as confidence.  They will be more likely to smile back at you (oddly, this seems to make me more happy myself)  As a corollary to the above, also try to project openness (open arms, calm/interested sitting posture, ect..).<p>- Say &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s up&quot;, ect... to everybody and pay attention to the answer.  The most wonderful thing most people can talk about is themselves.  Let them, and then Ask Questions.  Conversations are like ping-pong, they cannot survive unless people serve and then return serves<p>- Learn people&#x27;s names and then use their name when you talk to them.  The most wonderful thing they can hear is their own name.<p>- Work offhand compliments into your speech.  True for female or male.  Nice hairstyle, excellent choice of clothes, ect..  Only things where they&#x27;ve made a choice or developed a skill that then worked out well in your estimate (ie, not natural features).  Effectively complimenting their judgement while showing you&#x27;re interested in them<p>- Look people in the eye.  It is extremely difficult to establish a connection or communicate interest without looking people in the eye.  People who don&#x27;t are viewed as shifty or evasive.  You&#x27;re not staring, but when you say something, look the person you&#x27;re saying it to in the eyes.<p>- Get in shape.  Aerobic exercise gets you out, looking healthy, and is another form of social contact.  It also keeps weight low, which affects features like facial fat and general desirability. For Anaerobic exercise, women are biologically programmed to find certain physical features interesting, develop them. Good self image also helps build self confidence<p>- Find good rolemodels.  If you want to be charismatic, find people who are charismatic.  Its much easier to develop effective habits with good examples<p>- Grind charisma and confidence. All things require practice.  You should try to talk to people at every opportunity.  Also pay attention to effective things people do.  (Perhaps a co-worker who grabs everyone&#x27;s attention at a meeting or a friend who effortlessly strikes up a conversation with a stranger)  Note and then practice those techniques.",1402940437

Accelerated to a very significant fraction of c would allow you to visit practically everywhere in the galaxy within a few years of ship time. But on the outside, millennia will have passed.<p>You can see why that&#x27;s not practical, because everything you left behind would be gone. Still, there are scenarios where this might be a valid solution.<p>However, you could never reach a destination that&#x27;s speeding away from you faster than the speed of light. Because you can&#x27;t accelerate your spacecraft beyond that speed, parts of the universe will always be unreachable - which is the point of the article.<p>You might wonder why galaxies moving away from each other faster than the speed of light works at all given the cosmic speed limit. The answer is that their &quot;movement&quot; is not normal, inertial movement as we know it. Instead you might imagine that new space is being created in between them, driving them away from each other by simply scaling up the distances involved.<p>Given the practical and theoretical limits on spacecraft acceleration, people have been thinking about a different way to travel, a way that doesn&#x27;t involve momentum but instead manipulates spacetime to simply shift an object to another position without acceleration. The article hints at this as well. It makes sense because technically the acceleration and deceleration part of a journey is wasteful and limiting. At this time, it&#x27;s the only way we know how to get from A to B, but we&#x27;re all hopeful that one or more alternatives can be researched which allow us to simply go somewhere else without using traditional movement.",1402940185

7900320,comment,7899481,7899481,3,0,AaronFriel,,,"Google, Amazon, and Azure appear to have shaped their clouds after their internal needs first. This has lead to peculiarities in their pricing and feature sets. Amazon, for example, is fine with scaling out to an extreme degree, and so their storage options, particularly their provisioned IOPS options, are rather expensive. Their network and storage infrastructure is likely the oldest and with the lowest turnover rate, so they&#x27;re the most expensive to get performant storage on.<p>Google probably has the highest server turnover rate, and my wager is that they recently switched to new SSDs to reduce failure rates in their datacenters. My guess is that their compute servers are now swimming in excess IOPS, and so they are <i>clearly</i> the cheapest if you want very fast storage. This reminds me of Facebook purchasing massive quantities of SSDs for their own datacenters.<p>Microsoft has very peculiar needs. Azure grew out of servicing internal Microsoft IT needs first, so it is stuck with some quirks. You don&#x27;t provision IOPS, you create disks, which you attach to VMs. There are no IOPS tunable options for their PaaS, only IaaS VMs. They use software RAID (Linux or Windows) to turn multiple disks into higher speed storage. Their storage backend can only be described as weird[1], because whatever you think the actual disk layout looks like from your VM&#x27;s perspective, it doesn&#x27;t look anything like that on the storage layer. They partition data into chunks (disks) which get written to a distributed, log-structured file system on JBODs. Every 1GB extant is made immutable once full, and they use erasure encoding to distribute the data such that they can sustain 2 failures with only 33% disk overhead. The result is that writes are cheap (almost all writes are sequential) and the backend does a bunch of compute work to make reads fast (with caching of metadata and the erasure encoding, I&#x27;m guessing).<p>[1] - <a href=""http://snia.org/sites/default/files2/SDC2013/presentations/GeneralSession/AndrewEdwards_Windows-Azure-Storage-v5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://snia.org/sites/default/files2/SDC2013/presentations/G...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/179583/LRC12-cheng%20webpage.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/179583/LRC12-cheng%20webp...</a>",1402940047

The Swedish temperance movement started in the early 1800s, and gained a lot of strength with the starting of IOGT in the 1880s. This latter growth was strongly influenced by the Good Templar movement in the US and Canada. The peak was likely the Swedish prohibition referendum in 1922, where 51% of the voters voted against prohibition. (There have only been six referendums; others include &quot;join the EU?&quot; and &quot;adopt the Euro?&quot;)<p>Instead, Sweden moved to a quota system - the Bratt system - first for hard alcohol and then for all the lowest alcohol drinks. While the quota system disappeared in the mid-1950s, the government still has a monopoly, excepting through bars and restaurants.<p>While on the other hand, Iceland had prohibition from 1915 until (in some form or other) 1989. That ending is still celebrated as &quot;Beer Day&quot;, because until then the Icelandic temperance movement had successfully argued that strong beer, being cheaper than hard liquor or wine, would cause more depravity so should not be sold. People ended up mixing legal, weak beer with hard liquor to make an ersatz strong beer. Prohibition of that mix finally tilted the scales to end prohibition.<p>Norway had prohibition from 1916 to 1927, again, from the same temperance movement that was strong in the US.",1402939859

Everything is through state stores, and we can&#x27;t even avail ourselves of direct shipping (unless it&#x27;s direct to the state store :O). It makes finding less common items so very difficult and time-consuming.<p>One might conclude that beer would be easier to purchase. No go. If you want to buy a bottle of beer or a six-pack, you have to go to a bar or restaurant where they can sell you up to 192 ounces of beer. Anything over that, and you have to go to a beer distributor instead where you can only buy beer by the case or by the keg (still no wine or liquor). Some grocery stores have gotten smart, and have setup little cafes that are separated from the main stores. Adding a table or two, and some gas station microwave sandwiches is apparently enough to do squeak by and sell beer as a restaurant.<p>Naturally, no one particularly likes our system. But everyone has a vested interest. Gas stations want to sell beer (a regional chain, Sheetz, has been lobbying for changes for a few years now), but can&#x27;t. Restaurants and bars don&#x27;t want to lose their current monopoly on low-volume sales. Distributors fear a future where six-packs are more convenient, lest customers buy six-packs rather than a case with more beer than they want at a given time. And state store employees have been going deathly insane for years over the possibility of liquor store privatization, a separate reform that&#x27;s often brought up alongside the others.<p>Together, these groups are amongst the most influential in the state and they&#x27;re not afraid to use that influence to fight reform efforts. Simply put, it&#x27;s a mess. Until I read your comments about the Beer Store&#x27;s rather interesting ownership, I honestly couldn&#x27;t imagine how much more fucked up things could be.

7900283,comment,7898035,7898035,3,0,atmosx,,,"Hello,<p>I’m not sure I fit into the conversation because although I have lived the last 2 years in exile in order to finish my university (in 3.5 years I might a Pharmacy degree at hand). Let’s say that I was on a mission and it payed back.<p>I’m not an introvert. In my town there are more people than I could count that would wanna hang out with me. I have a girlfriend, a sports-car, etc.<p>The things I do when I wanna get “connected” in a totally foreign area are the following:<p>1. Go to the gym, take some special courses (could dancing classes, or kick-boxing. I’d go for the dancing classes any day of the week). The gym is an excellent way to get fit and meet new people. Go to a popular place, not the one that is closest to your area but always empty. Get there the after-work hours that the gym is full (in Europe that’s 18:00 to 21:00 PM).<p>2. Get haircuts as much as possible. Like once every three weeks. It’s not so much about the hair, although aesthetics are extremely important too, it’s about becoming friends with the most notable chit-chat in your area. Pick a place which is full of females. Don’t go to a ‘mens place’. These hair-dressers (or whatever they wanna call themselves), like to chit-chat more than anything. Try to open a conversation. If you find the right place, they will open the conversation not you (so it’s easier for introverts).<p>3. Except from the gym, try outdoor activities. What you’re good at? Hacking? Try to find a local hacker-space. You’re into chess, try to find a chess club. You’re into ballroom dancing, go for it. If you’re not into anything, then try to find something that you’d like to do, and go for it. The easiest way to meet people outside of school/job/university is doing activities together. If you can afford it, learning an instrument is also another extremely good way to get connected :-)<p>4. Try to be active on social media. Connect with the people you are in the gym (not stalk, just connect). Will help you extremely to have their facebook/twitter account and follow/comment/share.<p>5. Organize: Once you go out with a friend or two. Try to organize something your self and invite them to join you. Be pro-active (“Do you wanna go to the movies next week guys? There’s this great film!”).<p>A couple of notes about conversations with people you don’t know:<p><pre><code>    * Never answer with ‘yes’ or ‘no’. If you do, always come back in a question. \n    * Try to look the eyes of the person you’re talking too. Makes you look strong and straight character. It also gives you the advantage to read ‘extra signals’.\n    * At the beginning try not to express a negative opinion about anything (politics, specific tv shows/characters). Try to get the other party to express a definitive opinion. If you don’t agree, let them know but very smoothly and never in absolute ways.\n    * Try not to move your heads when talking. Avoid grimaces. Let the other’s do them.\n    * In all this, try to be yourself. Never say or do anything you can’t back-up.\n    * Try to be funny, but not too much.\n    * Try not to get early prejudices. Takes time to get to know each other. Things might be different from what the other guy/girl is letting you know.\n    * Remember to always... SMILE :D\n\n</code></pre>\nAs a last note. Improve your style<p>The ancient Greeks had a saying that is extremely deep, IMHO. It’s not absolute but goes a long way: “mens sana in corpore sano”. A healthy mind lives in healthy body. But the meaning is not healthy as in 100%-gym fit.<p>Being fit, stylish and well behaved will give you a head-start as a choice of friend/partner. By stylish I don’t mean expensive clothing, I mean ‘stylish’.\nDon’t wear very old shirt if you can get a new (cheap/expensive depends on your financial status) shirt. Treat yourself better and you’ll be treated better. Try never to smell bad. If you smoke for example, try always to clean up your clothes and hair. Make sure you never stink of sweat or anything else. If you can’t get a car, get a second hand vespa for example and paint it, to make it look &#x27;like a new one&#x27;. Being stylish (as the Italians know) is not about money it&#x27;s about ideas.<p>If you don’t know anything about fashion, gyms, style in general… Well the internet is here to help you. Remember that with a ‘classic’ look you’re always acceptable, don’t take any risks. By being fit I don’t mean an having musces, I mean not being overweight. Being clean (haircut, nails, clean teeth, clean clothes, use a fragrance daily, etc.) is the most important of all things. People would stand next to you if you’re cleaned up, and won’t even if you are their relative if you are not.<p>Hope you find what you’re looking for quickly :-)<p>good luck!<p>ps.

You still have to <i>earn</i> that degree based on work and merit and it certainly isn&#x27;t the same thing as a handout.  The idea that money is always related to agency is idiotic.  There are plenty of people who have the agency to obtain a college degree but don&#x27;t have the resources, monetary or societal support, to do so.",1402939548

This is harmful to both men and women. In this case, women are believed to be less physical able to keep up with the demands of manual labor on a construction site. Add in the fact that manual labor is often perceived as &quot;lower class&quot; and it makes a certain amount of sense those who are fighting for female equality would start with jobs in fields that carry social prestige. When you feel like you aren&#x27;t getting enough of the cow/steak, why would you fight for the hooves? Stigma against &quot;low class&quot; jobs also needs to stop - these are very important tasks that we entrust people with.<p>I am sure that there are some women who might want to go into construction who are turned away by site managers who don&#x27;t believe a women can perform as well or that they will be a &quot;distraction&quot; on male-dominated worksites. I am sure that a few more might have been turned away by a few bigots who aggressively treat them as though they don&#x27;t belong on site.<p>[edits below]\nJust wanted to add that it is also easier to fight a fight based on the idea that women are just as smart as men, but relatively harder to fight the fight that women are just as strong as men.

7900257,comment,7898035,7898067,1,0,Jtsummers,,,"So I wanted to reply here so you&#x27;d see this. Language seems to be one of your main concerns, but your writing is fine. Have you considered taking language/diction classes? You don&#x27;t need to change your accent, but part of the problem with spoken communication may be that you aren&#x27;t hearing the difference between two words that people are saying or you are, but when you speak the words come out incorrectly (per American pronunciations at least). I had a professor in college, for instance, that always pronounced &quot;robot&quot; as &quot;rabbit&quot;. Once we knew this it was easy for us to understand (by context, rabbits had no place in the discussions), but we could never convince him that he was doing this. A diction coach or language teacher may help you with this aspect of your conversation skills. Similarly, risk embarassment and find a colleague that you get along with decently, and ask them to critique your speech. You may not like what they say, but if you can get past the emotional boundaries and accept the criticism as constructive it may help you to improve.<p>Also, to work on your vocabulary, you may consider reading novels that&#x27;s where the bulk of my vocabulary comes from. Also, consider enrolling in a community college writing course (not basic composition, but something like creative writing). This&#x27;ll get you out of your home, around other people, and deliberately practicing your language skills (at least in the written context, which paired with practice ought to improve your spoken language skills).<p>EDIT: And something to remember. You may find the class embarrassing, because you don&#x27;t feel up to the task or on par with your classmates English skills. Don&#x27;t fret it. It&#x27;s an exercise for that as well, getting over the mental barriers around embarrassment. Accept that you&#x27;ll make mistakes, make them in public, and then move on with your life. One of the best things about doing this in a class? Other people will make mistakes too. And when it&#x27;s over, you don&#x27;t have to see them again if you don&#x27;t want to.

So what did they do? They set up automated bots, which had just enough logic to fool a human into thinking it&#x27;s speaking to it&#x27;s own kind. If someone engaged them in a conversation, and IIRC, asked for some sensitive information (though I&#x27;m not sure of the latter), they generated an alert and a real, human police officer took over the bot.<p>But either an avatar or other human being - I&#x27;m still not sure about the legality of the whole thing; a long time ago I learned something along the lines that law enforcement is not allowed to &#x27;bait&#x27; someone into doing something illegal; as the whole situation could be doctored to force somebody to do something they wouldn&#x27;t have done otherwise. I think it&#x27;s related to your question; but unfortunately I can&#x27;t recall what the concept is called, or if I&#x27;m completely off-track here anyway.<p>Though in the end; the person still did something illegal, and I can&#x27;t think of this line of reasoning to work well in court.",1402939082

My parents have been in USA for 30 years now, I can&#x27;t say that they have fully assimilated. They largely stick to Asian neighborhoods with Asian friends. \n2) Make friends through activities. Males tend to bond around an activity/hobby, we don&#x27;t get together just to get together. Activities gives us something to talk about, something to do together and something learn from each other. Maybe it&#x27;s hacking electronics, gardening, etc. \n3) Find something to work at to boost your own self-confidence. It&#x27;s a cycle, the better you feel about yourself, the more people are drawn to you, which helps you feel better about yourself. The internet typically recommends exercise, but find something you think is a weakness and work at it. For me, it&#x27;s swimming in open water, which I find absolutely terrifying, but every time I swim a little bit further, I feel a lot better about myself.\n4) If you need to get a roommate, get a roommate. Sounds like you are still in college if you are in an internship. When you go back to school, embed yourself into campus life. It&#x27;s far easier to make long friendships in college than at work.",1402939015

In the final analysis one of the things that came out of it was the observation that very few of the folks who were arrested over the course of this operation were known to have been engaged in any serious (say, worse than just being a pot smoker) criminal activity outside of whatever the ATF agents had enticed them to do as part of the sting operation.  Oftentimes this took the form of singling out people who weren&#x27;t too bright, or were in a financial tight spot, and applying a lot of social pressure to encourage them to commmit crimes.<p>In other words, the vast majority of the criminal activity people were being arrested for were crimes that the ATF had manufactured in the first place.  The real burglars and drug dealers knew enough to stay away.<p>I can&#x27;t help but worry there might be a similar situation going on here.  I&#x27;d be curious to know how many of the 1,000 individuals caught in this operation have any prior history of abusing children, and I&#x27;d be curious to know if the folks running this operation were using this child persona to actively solicit people.

People are able to access the internet while on the go. In the case of Amazon and Google they&#x27;re leveraging a brand and existing user base that they&#x27;ve been building for years.

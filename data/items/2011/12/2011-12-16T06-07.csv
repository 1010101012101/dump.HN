I know people are going to reply to this with some reference to ""but it is of intellectual interest!"" -- but really, there are lots of different places on the Internet (thousands, maybe millions!) to discuss lots of different things.

I suspect GP is just tired of these self-important flame wars plastered all over HN. These epic battles of egos, written in a tone that incites rather than argue, are getting very, very tiresome.<p>Android vs. iPhone. Devs vs. Designers. Tech founders vs. Non-tech founders. MBAs vs. CS. Instead of just arguing the merits of whatever point one has, it's become all too common to just lob ad hominem insults, call each other self-indulgent assholes, declare each others' views to be ""horseshit"", etc etc. It's grandiose posteuring and ""witty"" jabs disguised under a thin veneer of ""legitimate discussion"". It's like watching a pro wrestling match.<p>This is what I enjoy least about the startup community - and it certainly and obviously isn't contained to just HN. There's so much venom being spewed around for no good reason whatsoever. All of this mud-slinging is about as mature and informative as Kim Kardashian on TV.<p>It's like we can't communicate an opinion or belief without wrapping our entire egos into and making a spectacle out of it.

3359789,comment,3359368,3359368,1,0,SeoxyS,,,"The author of this post is so misguided it boggles the mind I'm a developer, but I chose to study design in college rather than computer science, because in my opinion design is much harder to master than programming is, and can be a much greater catalyst to success than pure engineering alone can be.<p>I see design as an enabler. Engineering is where the heavy lifting is done, but design is what makes that possible. I hate to bring up Apple as an example, but when you look at, for example, Siri: voice recognition, understanding grammar and meaning within human sentences and the all technology behind it is fantastic engineering. But what differentiates Siri from anything else out there is the design. The fact that the AI has a personality, that it jokes around and does not <i>feel</i> like a machine, that's what makes it accessible to humans and what makes it so insanely great. And that's design.<p>I agree with the author to the extend that glossy buttons and a textured background does not a good product make. Indeed, there's a lot of good-looking crap out therebut that's not design, and the author's argument that that's what design is makes him look like an ignorant fool.",1324018456

Stop creating shitty startups that look amazing.<p>I don't understand how enhancing value doesn't create value. Value is value, there isn't good value and bad value, there's only more or less of it. If pushing pixels does a better job enhancing value than creating features then I am absolutely going to (have someone else) design the shit out of that product.<p>I see design much like I see testing. Both of these are meant to build integrity in your product. Design is perceived integrity, while testing is conceptual. If you don't proactively maintain the integrity then the lack of quality compounds. Treating them like a second class citizen will do nothing but cause troubles.",1324018283

But, when top talent is complaining along these lines, its usually a sign that they didnt feel as if they had a say in these rules.""<p>Well, no, not really.  This strikes me as patronizing, as if they're saying, ""those silly employees <i>say</i> they mean X, but they <i>really</i> mean Y.""  Well, no, I mean X.  When I say I don't like bureaucracy, it's not because I can't get along with rules I didn't have a hand in.  I can deal with other people's rules.  Big companies have certain disadvantages in communication and coordination, and things like rules and processes and standards can help.  I totally get that.<p>But what I keep seeing is that nobody's looking at what the rules are trying to accomplish and trying to make it easier to follow them.  You want every change to be accompanied by a requirement or bug reference?  Great--not a bad idea; make it dead simple to do.  I remember filling out <i>paper forms</i> for code review documentation as recently as a few years ago.  That's just silly.  Code reviews aren't bad, but paper forms?<p>There's hundreds of little friction points that add up, though.  The ubiquitous second/large monitor.  Stock machines with slow, small drives and RAM.  More and more network resources moved offsite, accessed via a slowish WAN.  Limits on email storage, and auto-deletion.  Limitations on what software you can install.  It goes on and on, down to the breakroom amenities, office supplies, and so on.<p>Every little (needless) obstacle between me and the work getting done just pushes me closer to the door.

This way designers and copy editors could work in a CMS like they do with the old CMS solutions, but instead of it running server side, it would export all of the content to flattened HTML files. For the dynamic stuff it could be plugable so that the content is published to content files that can be picked up by ones favorite client side templating framework.<p>Further, it could be enhanced to support WYSIWYG editing for different widget toolkits, say Dojo's Dijit or jQuery UI, where front end developers could write a widget, add it to the CMS and then site editors could add it to a page, Think of Drupal but for pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS based apps. The more I think about it, the more I really want this tool, the new JavaScript app stack is so much cleaner than the old stack and I would love to see a CMS tool that makes a clean break from the old cruft and provides a tool specifically for this market. If anyone is looking for an idea and decides they would want to pursue building a CMS like this, feel free to contact me (in my profile). I would love to discuss my ideas for a CMS like this, as I said, I just have too many irons in the fire to even embark on such a project, but would love to see it come to life.

Huh? We're talking about how children are influenced. They aren't victims. Unless you think society at large has no influence over the development of a child, I'm not really sure what you're up in arms about here.<p>The whole point is to spend less time discouraging some types of play while encouraging others based on gender roles (i.e. Billy shouldn't be playing with dolls, he <i>should</i> be playing with toy guns).<p>Also, if a child only ever sees male doctors, do you think that doesn't subtly influence whether or not being a doctor is seen as a male-only thing to do?

I'm not sure that his run at Mother Theresa was worthwhile, his run at Kissinger probably was and his support for the war in Iraq was ridiculous.

You can have the most beautifully engineered solution to a problem that nobody has or is willing to pay to have solved, and you'll still have a bullshit startup. Marketing <i>is</i> also horseshit.  You can have the most amazingly viral video for a product that nobody wants and you will still end up with 0 sales and long-term, 0 customers.<p>the point here is that there isn't a startup fund or growing sentiment that seems to champion engineering or blogging or X as a fundamental part of the startup equation. it's all just a toolbox. but strangely, there is one for design.<p>the real issue that early startups need to focus on is solving a problem and creating value. that's actually much, much harder than you think and it should be 100% of the focus in the early stages.<p>forget about engineering and design.",1324015756

And it's also important to note the difference between visual design (UI) and UX. You can't create value without good UX. And good designers do both UI and UX. So design is important, the visual aspect not so much, before you have something ppl want",1324015712

It might be argued, by the cynical or the naive, that all advances begin that way. True, a period of a matter of months is specified, but dont I seem to recall, in President Obamas jaunty account of his courtship, that it took him a certain amount of time to wear down his intended target? I dare say that many of us could say the same, while reminiscing among friends, and still hope to avoid getting too many sidelong looks. But in the present circumstances there seems to be a danger of a straight-out politicization of the sexual harassment issue, with many people deciding it in advance on the simple basis of campaign calculations, orto put it more crudelyof whose ox is being gored. This appears to represent a general coarsening by silence, and yet another crude element in a depressing campaign. ""<p>-Hitchens<p>I have always suspected that Christopher Hitchens is really a child of Indianapolis or Topeka who spent a year in London while an undergraduate at the North Dakota State Technical and Agricultural Community College or some such and returned with an accent and a ubiquitous unopened umbrella so thoroughly does his Englishness come off as an affect. And, to crib from our friends across the pond, he comes off as a real tosser. ""I dare say""? It's as if, sensing his own impending demise, he's angling to be played by Maggie Smith in the biopic.<p>Any man willing to gratuitously fondle the mother tongue as Hitch does above is obviously going to be an apologist for molestation.  If you're a liberal, then you'll find it particularly appalling that Hitch first made his conservative bones, you'll pardon the expression, not by cheering for the death of a million Iraqis, but by stroking feverishly over Monica and Kathleen Willey.  This was evidence of Clinton's despicable character, whereas here we are in grave danger of ""politicizing . . . the sexual harassment issue,"" as if chalking it up as an issue has not by fucking default cast it into the baleful form of politics.",1324015232

No other reasons.<p>#1. When FB strategist comes to Zuckerberg, he tells him: &quot;listen this company is making dent in our traffic. If its continue the kids that abandon FB for Snaptchat will create $XX billions (sum A) of a hole in ads sales. So you need to go out and offer X% of sum A and pray they accept it.<p>#2. When FB ads vp come to Zuckerberg, he tells him: &quot;listen, here are my ideas how we can serve ads to those billions of eyeballs. This will create $XX billions (sum B) of profits for Facebook. So you need to go out and offer X% of sum B and pray they accept it.<p>Thats it.<p>As of whether its a &quot;startup&quot; or not, I say it is exactly for the reasons other says its not: revenue (or lack of it). I don&#x27;t think you can call a company &quot;startup&quot; only when they have a business model and or revenues. Snapchat through millions of uniques proved to the world they do solve some kind of problem, even if its as silly as flashing photos of a drunk teen for 5 seconds.<p>Edit: so the wisdom of the day would be: build a service for a huge user base that is important to facebook (youngsters), preferably on mobile (that is a future of computing/socializing).",1384621133

6745380,comment,6743358,6744958,1,0,drostie,,,"I think the point is that for each wallet stolen we would send a guy to jail for, say, two days. If we think that the guy has stolen approximately 100 wallets we prevent the next 900 from suffering by imprisoning him for the most part of a year, and that&#x27;s it.<p>What I haven&#x27;t seen yet is a comparison of cash, not to the cost of imprisonment, but to the cost of getting a job. That is, if someone is in prison for 200 days, that costs a few tens of thousands of dollars to the US taxpayer, so the arguments being advanced in these threads say &quot;this should be a response only to someone who is stealing $10,000 from us, otherwise the government is taking much more from us in taxes than the guy was taking from us in crime.&quot; That makes some amount of sense. It ignores certain problems (like &quot;who do the taxes come from?&quot; and psychological damage from getting mugged and so on), but it does have some core &quot;thrust&quot; to it.<p>On the other hand, to be an effective deterrent to crime, you&#x27;d figure that we&#x27;d want to make the crime net-unprofitable; that is, you&#x27;d want the 9-to-5 job at $7/hour to be a more profitable way of living than stealing $100 wallets. So this would suggest that for an expected number of 100 wallets stolen you should really incarcerate for, say, 2 years or so, so that the original crime &quot;really doesn&#x27;t pay&quot;, in the sense that you lose job-access for a total sum of more money than you gained. (That punishment might also have to be increased if the chance of catching someone who steals 100 wallets is not 100%.)",1384620600

2. an actual article, usually more long-form, I add to my instapaper list.
3. an article that might be interesting, but not right away, or anything else that is worth saving, but not useful right away, I add to Pocket.
4. for any comment pages, or articles that somehow don&#x27;t go through step 2 or 3, I add them to my OneTab list (by far my most-used chrome plugin). Often these are just things I can&#x27;t read right away, but I&#x27;ll probably look at later in the day, or things that instapaper can&#x27;t handle (HN comments).
5. anything that really stands out, I either add to my OmniFocus inbox, or to my Wunderlist inbox (Because I don&#x27;t have OF on my phone).<p>With that done, here&#x27;s how I process stuff:
1. when at my computer, I tend to first check my OneTab backlog. I open a few tabs, and read through them. This is generally during work breaks or lazy moments.
2. On the road, particularly short commutes, I read instapaper articles. I intentionally kept myself from getting internet on my phone so I&#x27;ll keep from aimless browsing. Interesting snippets or articles then go to my Wunderlist inbox for later processing.
3. On longer trips, or significant downtime, I generally look at Instapaper for the &#x27;better&#x27; material.
4. every once in a while, or when I&#x27;m reminded of something I read a while back, I check my Pocket &#x27;dump&#x27; for the relevant material.<p>All in all, this kind of just started happening through use.

That&#x27;s led to losing 30 lbs, reduced incidence of numbness in the extremities (residual effect of west Nile) & heart murmurs. In addition she seems to be functioning at a higher cognitive level. She has suddenly taken a huge interest in reading and has written over 300,000 words of a series of novels. She is negative for celiac or any food allergies.<p>I go on and off gluten free and I&#x27;m starting to realize that while the effects are less profound for me, I do better without grain (we do eat a lot of oats).<p>The business of eating exclusively meat and dairy is due to ignorance. You should be eating large quantities of vegetables, particularly leafy greens. The hardest part of changing your diet is re-learning how to eat.<p>OTOH I find the historical perspective somewhat suspect. If you believe Jared Diamond, grain led to the rise of civilization. I think that it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to understand life for the majority of humans. 100 years ago there were no antibiotics. 200 years ago there was no refrigeration. 300 years ago, the fastest way to move goods was by horse, which meant farming was naturally local. 500 years ago, corn and potatoes were unknown in the European diet. Humans have been around for about 2 million years. The best analogues are the abject poor in underdeveloped parts of the world, which makes the advice in &quot;Born to Run&quot; about &quot;eating like a poor person&quot; take on a new light.",1384620219

The article insinuates orange juice is bad for you because it has sugar in it. So what? People in Cuba get something like a third of their calories from cane sugar and are quite healthy; healthier than Americans. Many healthy cultures have subsisted on milk, which is loaded with sugar.<p>Cutting out sugars and simple starches like rice is just a convenient way for fat people to lower calorie intake. If you&#x27;re lean I&#x27;ve not seen any convincing arguments to avoid sugars.<p>Also, a lot of the paleo way of looking at diet as <i>the cause</i> of diseases is I think way over done. Some folks will insist almost any disease can be traced to diet, but I think there&#x27;s good evidence that yet to be isolated infections cause things like rheumatoid arthritis and MS and some other stuff. For example, skeletons show rheumatoid arthritis existed only in the New World and spread after contact to Europe and Asia. Another aspect is mutational load. People with weak immune systems or poorly tuned cell metabolism used to regularly die in childhood. Now these people survive to adulthood and eventually exhibit various degenerative diseases. They also pass their genes on, increasing prevalence in the population. Diet surely matters, but population increases in various middle age degenerative diseases probably has other factors totally independent from diet.",1384620201

The confidence level here is absurd, and some of the translation to laymen&#x27;s speak is completely misleading.<p>> And yet Perlmutter argues that his recommendations are not radical at all. In fact, he says, his suggested menu adheres more closely to the way mankind has eaten for most of human history.<p>The human race has had an extremely varied diet based on geography, and even today doesn&#x27;t really have a standard diet. (Sidenote: this is also the major flaw with labeling of diets like this as &quot;paleo:&quot; there was no &quot;paleolithic&quot; diet.  Yes some populations ate about 50/50 meat, fruits and vegetables, but few of today&#x27;s agriculture resembles that available even 20k years ago, so using that as justification is weak).<p>> Perlmutter says we need to return to the eating habits of early man, a diet generally thought to be about 75% fat and 5% carbs.<p>He gets more specific here, but he gets even more wrong.  There are some populations who had a diet of up to 95% carbs.<p>> Perlmutter uses bits and pieces of the effects of diet on cognitive outcomes  that obese people have a higher risk of cognitive impairment, for example  to construct an ultimately misleading picture of what people should eat for optimal cognitive and overall health, St. Catherine University professor emerita Julie Miller Jones, Ph. D., told the website FoodNavigator-USA.<p>This is the biggest issue with the article.  Perlmutter (or at least the journo covering him) does not do a good job of untangling obesity&#x27;s and caloric intake&#x27;s effect and the effects of wheat specifically.<p>> Further research published in the New England Journal of Medicine in August showed that people with even mildly elevated levels of blood sugar  too low to register as a Type 2 diabetes risk  still had a significantly higher risk of developing dementia.<p>Blood sugar does not necessarily come from ingesting sugar, it also comes from fat.<p>> This low-fat idea thats been drummed into our heads and bellies, Perlmutter says, is completely off-base and deeply responsible for most of our modern ills.<p>He&#x27;s almost right here: the idea of low fat diets is stupid.  We should focus much more on food quality and overall caloric intake.<p>> People are getting to this place of understanding that their lifestyle choices actually do matter a whole lot, he says, as opposed to this notion that you live your life come what may and hope for a pill.<p>Yes.  Good.<p>> &quot;The exact parts of the brain that allow people to become addicted to narcotics are stimulated by gluten, Perlmutter points out.<p>Oh come one.  Gluten and EVERY OTHER FOOD.<p>> Nutrition matters, Perlmutter says. The brain is more responsive to diet and lifestyle than any other part of the body and until now its been virtually ignored. We load up on medications when our mood is off, we hope for an Alzheimers disease pill when we get older.

We provided quotes online and sent a follow-up email to the person with their written quote in it.  I was asked to figure out a way to determine when the person read their email.  Our infrastructure was Classic ASP so I:<p>1.  Created a new web site in IIS<p>2.  Changed IIS&#x27; processing of .jpg to run through the ASP processor<p>3.  Created a .jpg program in the site that would update a quote&#x27;s record as having read the email<p>4.  Put an img tag in the HTML email that loaded the &quot;jpg&quot; file with the unique identifier on a querystring<p>Our business people used this to automatically initiate an outbound call to the person the second they read the email.

You&#x27;re (a) focusing on the very short term; presumably people would only commit one burglary under this model over their entire lifetime; and (b) you&#x27;re not being generous to the original case but taking it at a very literalistic level. It would be more generous to the point to suggest that the $40k/year would be spread out to support low-income folks who might have otherwise needed it. So, about 1% of American adults are imprisoned (and about 2% are on some form of probation or parole). On the other hand, 16% of our population lives in poverty. So we might reasonably expect to instead reduce the prison population by, say, half, and kick back that money to the impoverished. The salient point is that this would give a (1/2) * 1% / 16% = 1/32 dilution of the money, so we&#x27;re talking about giving all the poor people in the US $1k - $2k per year in order to reduce the rate of crime being committed. This makes their finances at least 5% better (the poverty line is about $20,000 for the 16% statstic).<p>So the more-generous question is, would being at least 5% better off financially reduce crime more than the 50%-shorter sentences for crime would increase it?

For Apple and Microsoft, their peers are in the NASDAQ index so that is the benchmark by which they are judged.<p>Microsoft being up 37% in contrast to its benchmark being up 28% is not &quot;a bit more than the average&quot;.  It is beating its benchmark by 32% which is an incredibly good performance.  Likewise, Apple underperformed its benchmark horrifically.<p>Think about it this way - $100 invested that returns 37% compounded growth over 8 years is now $1,240.98.

The simple-yet-efficient model of implementing Go would require some things to be taken care of - for example, the method dispatch tables.<p>Also, &quot;Android only uses dynamic loading&quot; - given the existence of NDK, how is that true? As far as I know, you can link statically whatever you want.",1384617813

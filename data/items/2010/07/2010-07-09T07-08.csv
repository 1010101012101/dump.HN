1500093,comment,1498528,1499935,0,0,kaib,,,"> If you want to take the code and run off with it in the sunset, you're perfectly able to do so. Instead of at least re-using/borrowing code from LLVM, they decided to embark on a rather laborious and difficult aspect of language development themselves with zero input from other projects.<p>I think there are two separate concerns, both which I'm disagreeing with you on. First, my understanding is that when ken wrote the initial compilers he wanted to focus on the frontend and re-use a backend. So he picked the plan9 compilers which he knew well (they predate LLVM by 10 years and he mostly wrote them). There was very little original work going into the code generation.<p>Second, I think you are grossly underestimating the initial cost of integrating with an open source project unkown to someone. The first Go compiler frontend was written in a few weeks or months. I'm guessing that having to pick up a new unknown backend (LLVM) and language (C++) would have set the project back enough to make it miss it's window of opportunity.<p>It seems to me that your argument is that an incorrect <i>choice</i> was made in what to re-use. That seems like a very different thing than NIH.<p>> ARM compatibility<p>ARM compatibility had nothing to do with the decision to re-use the plan9 compilers. I'm a compiler neophyte and when I wanted to add ARM support to Go it was an easy choice to go with the existing framework (there was a solid plan9 C compiler for ARM). If I had tried to port the system to LLVM at the same time as adding ARM support my skills would probably have failed me.<p>> fast compilation<p>One of the distinctive features of the optimizers ken wrote for plan9 C, which are used in Go, is that they are much simpler and faster than normal optimizers but produce less optimal code. The GCC Go compilers are slower and slightly less comprehensive but produce code of higher quality. LLVM would undoubtedly produce better code as well. I'm happy to go into more technical detail if you want to, it would help if you'd let me know how much practical compiler writing experience you have?",1278661973

1500011,comment,1499019,1499960,0,0,reneherse,,,"I think you'll have an easier time meeting women (and people in general) if you become a little more culturally active & outgoing. Your lifestyle is dominated by career/technical interests, which from your self description (and I say this with kindness) seems to make you a monotone personality. I sense that even you yourself are bored and frustrated with this monotony. If that is at all true, you must consider, what excitement and joy would you be bringing to a potential relationship?<p>You've probably adopted your technical and career focus because of your dream to live up to your potential and be successful. And that's admirable, of course. But there is a lot more to having a fulfilling life than just the virtue of productive work. There is the more human and cultural side of life, of which your desire to date is a part of.<p>It's time to expand your dream to include more of this other aspect of life.<p>It's a big world, but you haven't yet allowed yourself to explore much of it, neither intellectually or physically. Forgive me if I overreach, but have you made a negative value judgement on your own curiosity about the world, in the name of becoming a more productive and better programmer?<p>A worldly curiosity is what will give you breadth and diversity of experience, which in turn will make you a more interesting person, and ultimately make you a more creative problem solver and team member. It will also make you more socially comfortable and skilled.<p>Pay attention to the impulse that led you to your previous pursuit of classical voice that you mentioned. That's an unusual and intriguing hobby, an art that connects you with a tradition spanning thousands of years. And of course, there are lots of cool, nerdy music girls who do it too (especially if you're near a college with a good arts program).  You mentioned it was there that you had some success with women. I submit it wasn't just because some of the other guys were gay, it was because you were doing something unusual and interesting that made you seem more attractive as a person.<p>You've (admirably) rejected the idea of the seedy seduction manuals. Those aren't what dating is about, anyway. In a healthy point of view dating and relationships aren't about games, tricks, and seduction, and you're mistaken if you think that is what people in relationships are actually doing.<p>Dating is about discovering the interesting qualities of another person and exploring the world and reaches of human experience. It's also about being discovered as a person, by the other person. But you've got to have something interesting to discover. And for that you've got to be curious about the world first. So rather than just giving up on dating, gritting your teeth and forcing your nose closer to the grindstone with the goal of becoming ""more powerful and wealthy"" as a solution, I think you need to expand your curiosity, and the range and variety of your pursuits.<p>PS- This isn't a throwaway account; it's my first post.  And to be on topic: It's from someone who has had several very enjoyable long term relationships thanks to online dating sites.",1278659157

Don't give up if you have no luck right away. There are subtle communication aspects that you can learn as you go, and they make all the difference.<p>And keep away from specialized dating sites. Go with Facebook or any other kind of communication platform that are not invented exclusively for dating. People are just much more natural there. With some practise you can fairly easy figure out if there's a date potential just by looking at a profile.",1278658928

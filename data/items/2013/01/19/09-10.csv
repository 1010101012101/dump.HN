I don't believe in forceful learning (not suggesting that's what you are doing).<p>I know even from personal experience most people don't retain majority of things they've learned growing up or in college unless its something they care about or have done continuously. So maybe your daughter might be ready now, maybe not quite yet. Maybe she'll never be interested. Do the best you can but don't take your ideals upon her if she isn't interested. Believe me, more than anything I hope my kids will have a love for these things too, but its something they must discover to be interesting to them.<p>On that note, perhaps you could try it from a few different angles and see how it works. Five is still a pretty young age and the average is probably usually a few years older so don't lose hope if she isn't interested just yet",1358586133

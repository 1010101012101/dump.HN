As with startups, it is always good to some basic research about the market size. Amazon Sales Rank, a ranking based on sales velocity at Amazon.com and updated hourly, offers an interesting and useful tool to do so. Books with higher sales rank are selling much faster than the ones with lower sales rank.<p>The Sales Rank at any given time is available as part of Product Details section in Amazon listing. Historical values can be found at Charteous (<a href=""http://charteo.us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://charteo.us</a>).\n",1187319453

43332,comment,43074,43074,0,0,jmzachary,,,"This isn't an agreement or disagreement with the essay (I tend to lament the current sorry state of CS research but not necessarily for the reasons stated in this essay). But I would like to throw out that (a) before there was chemistry and physics, there was alchemy and that was hardly based on the scientific method, (b) computer science is becoming more ingrained in hard sciences via simulation and visualization, and (c) there is no law that says the scientific method can't be adapted to include information as a first-class primitive like stars, particles, energy, and inclined planes (among other things). Maybe (a) and (c) are the same point and we are muddling our way through as informatic alchemists at this stage of the field in the sense of CS being defined by the scientific method.<p>As a CS PhD, I like the essay and appreciate that it raises points to think about. I never really thought about academics as bureaucrats in that way but, as a former academic who left the hallowed halls for the reasons you describe much better than I could formulate, I think I agree with you on that point.",1187319174
43331,comment,43074,43074,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"The author chooses to rant about CS research being patronage that wastes US tax dollars. The examples he chooses don't support his argument very well.<p>He doesn't like Haskell or Caml because they sprung from academia. Haskell was designed mostly by a couple Scots and the little funding it received came from Microsoft Research.  Caml comes from IRNIA in France. No US tax dollars were wasted in either case.<p>He claims that Python wasn't invented by a programming language researcher. Guido Van Rossum was employed as a programming language researcher (working on ABC) by a Dutch government research lab, and then by NIST and CRNI in the USA. NIST and CRNI are US government funded research organizations. Using the author's train of thought, the development Python WAS partially funded with US tax dollars.<p>",1187318320

43329,comment,43195,43277,0,0,rickcecil,,,"Thought about Research Triangle Park in North Carolina? Got Duke University, UNC Chapel Hill, and NC State close by. Close to the beach, the mountains. Weather is great, though it does get pretty muggy in the summer. And the cost of living is reasonable. And it has a strong entrepreneurial community (cednc.org). It's certainly not a huge city, but it's got a lot going for it...though, it would mean moving to the east coast.",1187318177
43328,comment,43074,43310,0,0,mangodrunk,,,"I agree with you and didn't intend to say that we're smarter. I was just saying that it is easier to outsource simple programming problems than the required investment for tough problems. The pool of programmers that can take a specification and imeplement it is larger and doesn't require to be in direct contact with marketers, but the person who comes up with the spec has to be able to talk with the stakeholders.",1187317935
43326,story,,,1,2,amichail,"Significant funding leading to worse startup outcomes?",,"It seems to me that if you receive significant funding and are expected to hire software engineers that you may end up with a worse result.<p>After all, these employees are not as driven as the cofounders.  Even with equity, it's not the same.<p>Moreover, in a place like Silicon Valley, there's enormous competition for highly skilled software engineers.<p>So it might be the case that having the cofounders do much of the coding may result in a better outcome.\n",1187317707

The startups here now are coming around to the idea of a start up community.  It should be interesting to see how it plays out.  The other problem here is that a bunch of the good hackers go to places like Citadel rather than do a startup.",1187317258

43323,comment,43192,43192,0,0,portLAN,,,"Three examples of extremely motivated people:  Michael Jordan, Lance Armstrong, and Bill Gates.  Everyone knows they're hyper-competitive; the common traits seem to be extreme reactions to slights real or imagined (using anger as fuel) and an extreme aversion to failure, finding it unbearably painful.  They are antisocial, dealing with the public for business purposes, but not friendly.  They also all had an unshakeable conviction that whatever they were doing was <i>the</i> most important thing they could do, and they <i>wanted</i> to do it more than anything else in the world.  No divided focus!  They all loved what they did.<p>Jordan: If another player talked smack, Jordan would make a point of humiliating that player on court next time they met.  He also held grudges -- he froze out Sports Illustrated for years after they published an unfavorable article about his baseball career.<p>Armstrong: Like Jordan, but on a bike.  To make a point, he'd beat someone by a huge margin, rather than coasting to a win.  He held grudges, too, and wouldn't even let a rider way down in the ranks go for glory in a breakaway stage win if he was upset with them -- he'd set his team to chase them down, which meant everyone else had to chase too in order to keep up.  All his Tour de France wins were after cancer; he was riding for people fighting cancer, which is what made it <i>the</i> most important thing to him  -- he had incredible discipline as a result, which he lacked before the illness.   He couldn't stand the thought of coming in second in the Tour and he worried about his top opponents <i>purposely</i> to make himself train harder.  <p>Gates is likewise a well-known worrier.  He thinks that at any time, a competitor could come out of the woodwork that would spell the end of Microsoft, just like what Microsoft itself did to so many others.  Despite being at the top, he paddles as furiously as if he were just trying to keep his head above water.<p>They have all had unprecedented success.  However, there is a cost -- they've made a lifetime habit of being selfish, pissed off and dissatisfied.  This has consequences for every relationship, not just professional ones.<p>Inhabiting that headspace -- with all the worrying -- makes it a lot harder to enjoy life.  They are probably no happier than you are right now; it seems you can choose to increase your ""success"" <i>or</i> happiness, but not both at the same time; they are mutually exclusive.  You simply will not strive as hard if you are happy where you are.  Once the habit's ingrained, even if you decide you are successful enough and switch to pursuing happiness, you'll probably start out pissed off and dissatisfied thinking you aren't <i>happy enough</i>!  Interestingly, the very pursuit of happiness <i>pre-empts</i> happiness almost like a Catch-22.  In chasing happiness, you guarantee you aren't feeling it.  It's like ""do or do not; there is no try"" -- Yoda only one who decides what rules you have for it and when you'll <i>let yourself</i> feel happy, or not.\n",1187317152

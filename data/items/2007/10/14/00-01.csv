The real problem is that graphics cards powerful enough to decode H.264 for 1080p material usually have big, loud fans.<p>nVidia recently started incorporating HDCP and onboard H.264 decoding on their low-cost 8500 and 8600 graphics cards which is a huge relief. Some companies such as Gigabyte even make completely fan-less versions of these cards for <$200.<p>Now if blu-ray drives would just come down in price I'll be set :)",1192323590
67517,comment,67488,67488,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"A very nice development for SF.  There does seem to be a growing trend of programmers wanting to live in SF.  The downside is that they then typically have to commute south - thats been the case for the very large fleet of wifi enabled Google buses for a while. (Which the new Google office solves).  Apple is about to launch their own fleet of buses to get their SF dwelling programmers down south too.  <p>I must admit, the Apple headquarters campus is a very unattractive set of buildings, especially given Steve Jobs as CEO .  (Although I think the building program was done before his return.)  It would be nice if Jobs decides that living in style is as important as computing with style, and moved the HQ into one of the many rising towers in the City.  The more hackers in SF, the better.   :)",1192322953

If you can get the price below $1,000 then it would be affordable to security conscious companies.  It would have to be automated, and be a server so the company can login and view the data.

I want to create some JTV widgets for my channel!<p>Besides being used to broadcast your life this could be used with some development for video conferencing or group video chat.  Video Skype through a browser.<p>I embedded my friends Ustream video into my JTV channel and we were able to have a conversation, albeit an extremely delayed one.  <p>Congrats on the article Justin!<p>",1192322571
67513,comment,67407,67511,0,0,curi,,,"<i>In Wave Collapse/Many Worlds, a parallel universe is created in which wave collapse occured but gave a different outcome.</i><p>That is incorrect. Many Worlds does not say universes are created all the time, it says they already exist and become differentiated.<p>BTW all the other interpretations are ridiculous attempts to avoid facing counter-intuitive facts. See, for example, David Deutsch's speech at the recent Everett conference <a href=""http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/misc/everett/Deutsch%20-%20Apart.wmv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/misc/everett/Deutsch%20-%20Ap...</a>",1192322178

67511,comment,67407,67486,0,0,angryprofessor,,,">Universes do not split like that. That would mean many universes were being created from nothing every instant. What actually happens is there are already infinitely many ""universes"" and they become different. And not one per outcome, but in proportion to the probability of outcomes.<p>It's not the writers of the article who have no clue. It's quantum physicists themselves.<p>In the Copenhagen interpretation of QM, a conscious observer induces wave collapse (a random process). In this interpretation, there are no other worlds. In Wave Collapse/Many Worlds, a parallel universe is created in which wave collapse occured but gave a different outcome.<p>There are different interpretations of QM (e.g. bohmian mechanics or GRW/stochastic collapse) which don't have this problem. If you are interested in QM, I strongly suggest looking these theories up. But Copenhagen QM (the theory in most textbooks) does have this problem. <p>The reporter did an adequate job of explaining the consensus view. The problem is really that the consensus view can allow for nonsense such as what was described in the article.",1192321315

I don't see them competing with each other directly that much, as right now both OS are gaining primarily through Windows converts. The vast majority of hackers and power users aren't going to drop Linux completely for OSX, they'll just double boot or VM, and having a more Unix-centric focus in mainstream computing can only help to promote Linux software development.",1199583795

95224,comment,95177,95177,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't think that experiment makes sense: if there is a low quality copy for free and a higher quality copy for 5$ I take the lower quality copy to be for evaluation. So only 18% of the people who evaluated it decided to buy it. In fact even without the low/high quality thing, perhaps in a ""pay what you want setting"" people download first and evaluate. Perhaps those people who didn't pay simply didn't like the music.<p>Also, even in that experiment they seemed to have made almost 1$ per download - isn't that more than artists typically get per CD sale?",1199582491
95223,comment,95162,95162,0,0,Tichy,,,"Somehow that story seems to fall short of it's possibilities. What programming languages have been used, for example - maybe the 20000 lines people where Java developers and the 4000 lines people where lisp programmers (or whatever)? And the argument for measuring the productivity by lines of code wasn't really made in the article, it just says it is a bad measure and then goes on to judge everything by that measure.<p>How long is the summer anyway, three months? So 20000 lines could be about 200 lines per day?",1199582190

95221,comment,95168,95168,0,0,aaroniba,,,"I looked at EditArea before building the AppJet Code Editor (ACE).  (See our in-browser code editor with syntax highlighting at appjet.com).<p>The problem with EditArea is that the overlay method causes visible ghosting when you insert newlines, even on a fast computer.  Also not being able to see highlighting on the current line bothered me.<p>I based the ACE implementation on <a href=""http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror/story.html</a> only simplified the parser and added some features like paren/bracket/brace flashing.  The basic idea is to use design mode but keep careful track of the DOM of the design body and cursor.  The big challenges then become things like undo support (which we still haven't implemented yet), but the major advantage is that you get a fast and native feel, which is important.  We plan to open-source ACE pretty soon.",1199581830
95220,comment,95173,95173,0,0,Tichy,,,"Mini-PC or not, normal PCs are also getting so cheap that it might become difficult to charge much money for Operating Systems.<p>Also, I wonder if Bill Gates timed it deliberately so that his followers will fail, to cement the myth of his leadership? I guess not, but in general, it might be a consideration of CEOs when stepping down. Or maybe in general they tend to step down when prospects are poor.<p>As for the mini-PC, it might be cute, but so far I don't see why I would need one.",1199581775
95219,comment,95069,95116,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"95% of martial arts studios in America are purely commercial: basically a Bally's with sparring gloves and gi's.  Hardcore traditional schools are very selective in who they allow to train there or will often utilize a ""weed out"" strategy on newcomers (I've heard that Gracie BJJ schools are notorious for this).  A Wing Chun school I was interested in made me go through two interviews before they decided that I would be allowed to train there if I chose to.<p>Because of its dance-like movements, Capoeira is often marketed as ""yoga meets breakdancing meets pilates meets tae-bo"" in order to attract women, which is probably what your local studio is doing.",1199581675

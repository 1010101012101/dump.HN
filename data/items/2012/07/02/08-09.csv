4188014,comment,4182271,4182271,2,0,rdl,,,"<a href=""https://status.heroku.com/incidents/151"" rel=""nofollow"">https://status.heroku.com/incidents/151</a><p>I assumed this was a response to the recent hella-long outage:<p>""There are three major lessons about IaaS we've learned from this experience:<p>1) Spreading across multiple availability zones in single region does not provide as much partitioning as we thought. Therefore, we'll be taking a hard look at spreading to multiple regions. We've explored this option many times in the past - not for availability reasons, but for customers wishing to have their infrastructure more physically nearby for latency or legal reasons. We've always chosen to prioritize it below other ways we could spend our time. It's a big project, and it will inescapably require pushing more configuration options out to users (for example, pointing your DNS at a router chosen by geographic homing) and to add-on providers (latency-sensitive services will need to run in all the regions we support, and find some way to propagate region information between the app and the services). These are non-trivial concerns, but now that we have such dramatic evidence of multi-region's impact on availability, we'll be considering it a much higher priority.<p>2) Block storage is not a cloud-friendly technology. EC2, S3, and other AWS services have grown much more stable, reliable, and performant over the four years we've been using them. EBS, unfortunately, has not improved much, and in fact has possibly gotten worse. Amazon employs some of the best infrastructure engineers in the world: if they can't make it work, then probably no one can. Block storage has physical locality that can't easily be transferred. That makes it not a cloud-friendly technology. With this information in hand, we'll be taking a hard look on how to reduce our dependence on EBS.<p>3) Continuous database backups for all. One reason why we were able to fix the dedicated databases quicker has to do with the way that we do backups on them. In the new Heroku PostgreSQL service, we have a continuous backup mechanism that allows for automated recovery of databases. Once we were able to provision new instances, we were able to take advantage of this to quickly recover the dedicated databases that were down with EBS problems.""<p>Then I checked the date.  It's actually Heroku's response to their super-long April 2011 outage.  Yet, it appears the ""we should go across Regions"" lesson wasn't learned.",1341219483

Gender equality has come a long way since the 60s, especially in education, technology, and business (I'm not saying it's come <i>all</i> the way.)<p>Add to that, today's tech environment doesn't make your gender necessarily obvious, except if you choose to shove it into your readers' face. Take the linked blog, for example. It's indistinguishable from any other blog; the name ""Amber"" might as well be a male's pseudonym, and in any case, it's such low contrast and so small it's almost invisible. I know I skipped over it  also because I'm not typically interested in <i>who</i> wrote an article, but in the article itself.<p>So we have a population of males traditionally assuming everybody of relevance to technology is a man, and not many non-obnoxious ways for women to establish their gender in their postings (to be honest, I want it to stay that way. Your gender has absolutely nothing to do with what I'm interested in.)<p>Men need to stop whining and finally end the idiotic assumption that it is fine to use the default 'he'. English has a particularly elegant way out of the dilemma (just use 'they' whenever you'd use 'he') contrary to other languages where you will also need to adjust the inflection of verbs or nouns throughout the sentence.<p>It's a simple change. Nobody is going to get hurt, and it would do a lot to make women feel more welcome in the (formerly) manly sociotope 'technology'. Why is it such a problem for men to just make <i>such</i> a simple change?<p>(PS: please don't take my above post about women and their penetration into the technological sphere in the 50s and 60s all too literally.

Mainly because there's no way to know if 'I' is uppercase of 'i' or '' since there's not a separate place for Turkish 'I' in code tables. The same holds for 'i' (can't be known if it's lowercase of 'I' or '').\nI told 2 years ago and will say it again: PHP should provide a way to turn off case-insensitive function/class name lookup.

While it is of academic interest that a few web frameworks now support Python 3, real programs, even real websites, are going to rely on libraries to accomplish their underlying goals.<p>I will even further challenge you to defend your accusation that my experience is ""unique""; I personally find this idea incredible, given that I ask every Python programmer I meet ""2 or 3"", and not a single person has ever said ""3"". Yes: if you call out Python 3 in public on a Python 3 release post, a number of people will come out of the woodwork, but in a more random sample under more realistic conditions (non-Python developer conferences) the reality seems closer to 0%.

It appeared that YC found few very valuable gems though. Surprised ? You shouldn't because seed investors and Angel investors have strong bias to what a high potential candidate or project would look like.<p>I assume we have a similar strong bias regarding homeless, close to consider them as hopeless. Though I believe that there are gems in this group of people as well, that need only to be given a little push and help to shine out.<p>And as for Y Combinator, people would consider it all normal and obvious afterward if someone does it for them too.<p>My impression is that it was a kind of surprise for the OP to discover that he had a bias regarding such kind of homeless guy.<p>BTW a bike shop looks like a good long term investment considering the energy crisis.

I will even go so far as to say that your comment is needlessly patronizing, and thereby horribly insulting.<p>In my comments, I describe a specific phenomena that are leading to the problems that I experience: that there is now a fractured community of libraries for what are really two unrelated languages.<p>As some even-more-specific actual-examples:<p>1) key libraries such as PIL are not ported, despite your claims regarding the ease<p>2) of those that are, such as psycopg2, there are often awkward (and I will often claim ""broken"") semantic changes to the behavior of the API<p>3) not all libraries actually have maintainers to port the code at all (such as the iPhone PNG transcoder I rely on)<p>4) finally, there are libraries, even entire frameworks (mod_python), that rely on functionality that is actively being removed with prejudice (in the case of mod_python, for reasons I continue to not understand, despite having read copious e-mail exchanges on the Python mailing list regarding the issues)<p>(A quick aside, for anyone about to pull a ""lol mod_python"" on me: mod_python is fundamentally more powerful than the various replacements, something even the primary maintainer of mod_wsgi admits; there is a reason why, despite it having been retired from Apache due to a lack of maintainer, it was still used by Google engineers as the basis of their pywebsocket implementation.)<p>I will therefore challenge you to put up something behind your insults, and explain what you feel has changed, and how it affects the argument I have made. While it is of academic interest that a few web frameworks now support Python 3, real programs, even real websites, are going to rely on libraries to accomplish their underlying goals.<p>I will even further challenge you to defend your accusation that my experience is ""unique""; I personally find this idea incredible, given that I ask every Python programmer I meet ""2 or 3"", and not a single person has ever said ""3"". Yes: if you call out Python 3 in public on a Python 3 release post, a number of people will come out of the woodwork, but in a random sample under more realistic conditions (non-Python developer conferences) the reality seems closer to 0%.",1341216946

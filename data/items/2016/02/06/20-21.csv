The former often provides only a layer of obscurity, while the latter takes expertise to perform reliably.<p>Ideally the wallet&#x27;s key deletion functionality would include ensuring the private data doesn&#x27;t remain on disk (and warn if the media makes this impossible), but I think this is more or less impossible; a secure erase facility really needs to be implemented at the OS level, since it requires knowledge of the workings of the filesystems in use as well as its interactions with the physical media. And it gets worse; in the case of any solid state devices that perform their own write balancing, even the operating system can&#x27;t know what data has actually been lost.<p>Of course, if someone has your (unencrypted) hard drive digging around for old ZCash key data is probably low on the list of privacy-compromising information available to them anyway.",1454791959

11049791,comment,11049375,11049375,0,0,karmajunkie,,,"Others have pointed out that A) the particular market you&#x27;re looking it is somewhat tricky because of reliability requirements; and B) that a market with competition is a market with customers who will pay money, which is very true.<p>I want to offer a counterpoint to B, which is that a market with a clear leader is a market that isn&#x27;t nearly as big as you think it is. The reason for this is that peeling customers off an incumbent is a lot more difficult than it seems at first. The temptation is to tell yourself, &quot;This is a success if I get even a little bit of the market.&quot; That may be true for a market that&#x27;s wide open, or that doesn&#x27;t have a clear market leader. But if there is one, then your market size is really more like 20% of the addressable market, and your little slice of success has to be a lot larger than you think it is. And if its a good market, you&#x27;ve probably got a LOT of competitors thinking the same thing, and you&#x27;re fighting it out over the slice of the market you can actually get to.  I&#x27;ve experienced this in the event registration space, where a few companies like EventBrite dominate, and 300 other ticket companies fight it out for the 10% of the market that&#x27;s actually up for grabs. Your marketing costs skyrocket, the customer acquisition costs are dramatically increased, and you&#x27;re looking at a long slog to get to profitability.<p>All of that said, this doesn&#x27;t mean don&#x27;t do it. I&#x27;m a big fan of niche products, and being able to do the technical side means you&#x27;ve got an advantage over some potential competition who have to hire or contract out that part. But be aware that business success in a venture like this is harder than it may seem at first.",1454791897

Instead of letting a secular deflation emerge with growths in total factor productivity, central banks still do price level stabilization instead. The monetary disequilibrium economists have written much on this. George Selgin has a great and relatively accessible essay called <i>Less Than Zero</i> that discusses this.<p><i>No one in modern economic theory belieces the Marshallian tradition is identical to modern neoclassicism - never mind neoliberalism.</i><p>But there is no single &quot;modern neoclassicism,&quot; that&#x27;s the point. Yet to somehow deny that Marshall was a neoclassical is to make the term meaningless. The approaches of Marshall, Menger, Walras and others all had important differences despite being ultimately lumped as &quot;neoclassical&quot;.<p>Neoliberalism isn&#x27;t even an economic idea. It&#x27;s a political term used by people opposed to it to describe what they perceive as a shift into corporate rule since the 1970s. Yet this narrative is full of holes, not least of which is the history of mercantilism, imperialism and later corporation-state cooperation.

You would have to track wealth or income too.<p>Addressing your concern over volatile income is not that important and could compromise the usefulness of the metric. If you propose using GDP or any other linear function instead (rather a logarithm or power-law) then you cannot approximate utility and your number will be insensitive to changes in inequality.

Something I think about: if we don&#x27;t have corporations what replaces them? How do you implement business that require commitments that are larger than family?<p>For example. Consider a digital social network that was oriented around commercial arrangements. You could form complex contracts in a group, and produce a reputation system formed from sets of people. There would be a deposit system, and an opt-in judiciary for dispute resolution. Could this - a digital upgrade of the icelandic commonwealth - be a more powerful mechanism than The Corporation?<p>There&#x27;s a big difficulty in wanting to get rid of corporations, and that is that they emerged from a process of true evolution. The Dutch and then English East-India companies allowed humans to do things that had just not been viable previously. In fact, they were so successful that they could have obsoleted nation states. Certainly the East India company could have, and was reined in only because its shareholders and employees continued to show deference to the crown. Nation-states got scared at that point, and imposed significant political controls - corporations are not allowed to maintain standing armies.

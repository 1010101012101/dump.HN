1037133,comment,1036585,1036585,0,0,xenoterracide,,,"Wow I really disagree with this. Most websites do have a profit model, or were never tying to make any to begin with. Correctly said most /popular/ web businesses don't have one. A large majority of sites are just personal pages or business giving itself a web presence, most of these pages (outside blogs) aren't ones we visit daily. Even then some companies always had the revenue model of advertising, like newspapers and TV they just haven't quite adapted it to the web. Depending on how much they charge Comedy Central seems like they might have a good plan for translating TV to the web and be profitable.<p>I disagree with Speed of the remote too. sure it's fast to flip channels and radio stations but that's not much different than clicking next on a page as long as the button doesn't move it's just as fast. I for the life of me can't figure out how to turn on closed captioning on my tv with the comcast remote. I know it can be done, but to be honest where ever it is it's not obvious. And how do I find the channel comedy central is on if I don't know it? I have browse a channel at a time? this is horrible with a few hundred channels, they need to make it more scalable like DNS + search engines is (on demand actually has a decent interface lets make the whole guide alphabetical shall we). On a radio the only reason I can get directly to say station 106.1 is because I have it programmed in to my favorites. Radio's UI would be much simpler if they had  a keypad like a phone and you could type in numbers as well as with a seek.<p>He says designers need to learn more about traditional product design but honestly tell me how you're going to translate a 3D dresser drawer to a website.<p>He says that more users move from individual designed websites to ""platforms"" (my simplification) this is not true, lots of people who had there own site now use these platforms for additional marketing, most have not moved from there original source. Most users using these sites do not have, never did, and never will have a need for a professionally built site.<p>Also Technology moves from primitive to complicated to simple? that what I call the Comcast remote with 100 buttons and not one can turn on closed captioning. I can't honestly think of technologies that moved from primitive to complicated to simple. Most I see only get more complicated as features are added, sure some have really bad UI and are complicated but that doesn't mean that's how technology works. Would you say the telephone today is more or less complicated than even 20 years ago? In fact I'd say that all technology just gets more complicated not less, though sometimes the UI gets improved to hide that complication.<p>Honestly I don't think this guy has a clue at reality, his head is in a Silicon Valley reality perhaps.",1262876363

Python is implemented in C, but I don't have to care about C. The C source of the Python implementation is compiled to x86 machine code, but I don't need to know how that works either. Machine code is miplemented using logic gates, which in turn are implemented using electronics. Again, stuff I don't need to know about.<p>I write my program using a text editor which uses KDE, and below that, X Windows. These are both complex software systems, and again I DON'T NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THEM. Underneath X is the graphics card. This presumably uses some sort of memory-mapped display, but I don't know the details.<p>Back in the days of CP/M systems with 64K of RAM, one could understand a computer system in its entirety.

1037126,comment,1036924,1036924,0,0,DougWebb,,,"I had a completely different take on this then everyone else commenting; our software can be treated as an opaque black box too, and that can be detrimental.<p>My company recently started a new code review process: to save the reviewers time, changes are first reviewed by a non-programmer UX designer to verify that the UI behaves as the UX designer intended. The UX designer tests the application and either rejects it or approves it. If rejected, it goes back to the developer for more work, and if accepted it goes to the technical lead for code review. The theory is that the code reviewer doesn't have to confirm proper functionality, because the UX designer has already done that. (Our tech leads tend to be overloaded.)<p>The problem is that the application code is a black box for the UX designer. She can give it input and see if the output looks right, but there's no way she can determine if there is any particular input that will produce wrong output. At best she can expend a large amount of effort giving random input, but unless she can cover the entire possible universe of input (generally not possible) she can't guarantee correctness.<p>The code reviewer doesn't have this problem; the application is not a black box, so he can examine the code to determine the common cases and edge cases, and find unhandled cases. A code reviewer can determine which input will likely break the application by inspection rather than by trial and error. That's much more efficient, and we have a lot more confidence that correctness can be guaranteed.<p>Unfortunately, the code reviewers aren't doing that... they're not looking at correct functionality at all, because the UX designer supposedly is doing that for them. The process does not recognize and accommodate the opaque black box problem, and as a result the Quality Assurance team (who have the same problem but they do a lot more random testing) are finding bugs we completely missed.<p>Interesting note: our QA team have been dealing with this problem for a long time, and they've been quietly self-training as programmers in order to be able to read and understand our software changes. This has made them a very effective QA team, especially when they include suggested diffs in their bug reports. They're a pleasure to work with.",1262876177

On the other hand, a certain amount of transparency is critical so that users can easily develop a mental performance model, and so that it is clear how they can extend the abstraction (e.g. by writing plugins) when necessary.  One of the most difficult parts of library design is to have enough of the good transparency without ending up with a brittle system or a system that users have to wrap in order to break awkward dependencies.",1262875508

There are many problems with this line of reason:<p>1) People in China can get on the web as well.  Due to how the firewalling work, most probably don't even realize it happens.  Just sometimes they try a link that times out.  Happens all the time.  Are you sure it isn't already happening to you?<p>2) Are you sure the information you're seeing is true?  In some cases you wont have any way of completely proving one way or another.<p>3) For some countries, seeing the info doesn't affect anything because of the level of indoctrination the people go through.

To be a good abstraction, it should let you retrieve a page in one line of code:<p><pre><code>    page_string = urlopen('http://google.com')\n</code></pre>\nThere are a lot of default choices made for you here: all the headers to send, to follow redirects or not, what to do with cookies returned if there are subsequent request to the same domain, etc. There is also information thrown away, like most of the response headers. You may also want to get access to the response as an I/O stream instead of loading it at once in memory.<p>A good library will be transparent in the sense that it would let you modify each and every one of these defaults and access the information under the covers if you need to, I see no way around this even as the industry matures, or you will get into the Larry Page's sort of trouble desperately trying to modify your user agent string.<p>I wonder if there is a generic way to make libraries as transparent as possible in a uniform way, perhaps having  language support for ""default"" parameters and a syntax to alter them. Yes, it goes directly against encapsulation.",1262873716

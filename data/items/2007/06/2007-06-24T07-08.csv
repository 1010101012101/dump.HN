Do they mean loose Apple millions, or not sell a zillion a week? I suppose the fairest means of judging failure here, is to use Apple's target of 10m in the first 12 months. Which will of course require the pundits wait 12 months before declaring failure...<p>- In The Design (nee Philosophy) of Everyday Things, Donald Norman cites a designer who says it takes about six iterations of a new technology before it reaches a state where it has had most of the issues worked out and is ready for public acceptance, but because of the initial failures, most new technologies never get used more than once or twice  (I'm unable to find the quote in the book currently, but can look again if anyone is interested).
To put this in context, I don't think touchscreens have done their 6 iterations yet, and the current failures are making pursuing this difficult. Some things <i>are</i> the way of the future, but they require someone to risk failure in order to  get them there.",1182671789

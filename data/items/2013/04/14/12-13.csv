There is virtually no need to do this these days without introducing more risks from a security and memory perspective and the inevitable situation of ""integration hell"". I'd rather throw it in a JVM than drop to C. Then again if I started with a JVM I wouldn't have the problem to start with as it solves both ends of the problem. The CLR is equally applicable here. Go hits the mark too.<p>From my experience here dealing with a massive 100kloc python project. Python maintenance:<p>a) Horrible to refactor. I mean really horrible. You don't get everything right the first time and when it comes to fixing that it's hell.<p>b) no type safety or contracts which is hell when working with other developers.<p>c) indentation issues which are totally horrible at merge time as it introduces a shit ton more work to do.<p>Reliability:<p>a) Some algorithms don't scale the same way as they do in other languages due to the points the article raises. It gets to the point that for something in Java is O(N), it can approach O(N^2) due to all the dict fudging and copying which is not good.<p>b) It's slow anyway - I mean really slow. If something feels slow, it is slow. PyPy may fix this but (c) below causes an issue as well.<p>c) Optimisations aren't consistent across python versions (consider how crappy IO was in the first py3k drop).<p>I wouldn't use Python for a new project now.

5546763,comment,5546380,5546593,2,0,VLM,,,"model M for about 20 years.<p>You quickly learn the difference between a PS/2 to USB CONVERTER which converts PS/2 to USB signals for about $25 and a PS/2 to USB ADAPTER which allows a modern keyboard which can ""speak"" either USB or PS/2 to physically plug into a PS/2 and costs $1.50.  A genuine original model M requires a converter not an adapter.<p>Another genuine model M aspect not often discussed is you can pop the keycaps off the key with a bent paperclip and engrave emacs annotations on them and/or sharpie letter them and then 15 years later you'll still have to look at emacs keymappings even if you're a mostly VIM guy now.  Its kinda like getting a tattoo although there's no convenient laser removal, so don't do it unless you're really sure.  Every couple years I pop all my keycaps and put them in a tupperware with some dish soap and give them a shakey bath and they come out clean and the keyboard looks brand new.<p>For people who've never used/heard a model M, don't freak out about the noise.  Its probably 20 dB down from office banter ""my ball team is better than your ball team"" or whatever.  I mean if you're packed in so close than keyboard noise is a big deal, you're probably packed in so tight that there's a hundred other tightly packed issues so one more is no big deal.  When your boss won't let you use a model M from home because its ""too big"" because you've gotta fit seven programmers into a 6x6 cube, the real problem isn't the size of the keyboard.  Its not like a jackhammer.  Your typical laserprinter is louder and more obnoxious.",1365943481

This is horrible advice if taken on face value. To be fair, the author mentions things like KeePass. Use that. Make very long, random passwords.<p>>See, when it comes to a brute force attack, entropy makes no difference at all, because a brute force attack is a sequential attempt at every possible password, starting with the shortest first.<p>I think this is the biggest misconception regarding passwords. If we're using the phrase ""brute force"" literally, then yes. But if I were to write a cracker, I wouldn't be limited to that. The first thing it would do is grab the low hanging fruit. Examples:<p>1. Regarding the post, check all variations of a single digit repeating (say up to 100 times) in 1000 attempts. That's faster than I could check all variations of 2 character alphabetic passwords.<p>2. Check the same thing, but with all common keys on a keyboard layout (e.g. $$$$$$): < 10,000 attempts<p>3. Check common words in english dictionary: ~100,000 attempts<p>4. Check 10,000 most commonly used passwords: 10,000 attempts<p>Let me stop here and say that I can check ALL of the above in less time than it would take to check all variations of 3 characters using alpha, numeric, and common special  characters. To put it another way, I could grab all that low hanging fruit in <i>a billionth</i> the time it would take to grab all the passwords in the ""weak"" format (8 random characters) given by the author.<p>What I have come up with above is my armchair ramblings.

AT&T isn't a human, so who do you punish? You can fine AT&T the company, but that's not punishing the people who left the site like that, it's punishing the stockholders. Stockholders really don't like to be liable for the actions of fairly low level subordinates like that, and they have the political influence to make sure that doesn't happen. You could try to go after the specific admins who set up the site insecurely, but they're not unsympathetic people. The ones who do things like this are mostly people who are overworked or poorly trained through no fault of their own. The people who are really at fault, then, are the ones who hired admins without proper training or experience or put so much workload on them that they couldn't adequately do their jobs, but now you're talking about corporate executives who (like stockholders) don't like to be personally liable for the actions of subordinates and who have the political influence to make sure that doesn't happen.<p>So we're left with a situation where there is no one good to punish, but we have to punish <i>someone</i>, don't we? Something bad has happened! So we kill the messenger. The messenger doesn't have any lobbyists on staff.<p>What's missing from all this is that we really don't have to punish anyone. Just let the vulnerabilities be published. Companies don't want to hear that because it very publicly makes them look as dumb as they are, but if they can't stop it by threatening anyone with prison then the only way they can do it is by maintaining secure systems.

No need for a radio.<p>As to the question about the radios in cell phones the answer is yes and no. Yes a lot of modern baseband are nothing more than an SDR, but that's only part if the issue. The other issue is getting appropriate signal levels into and out of that device. For that you need specific filters and antennas for the frequencies you want to receive and transmit. For example, an LTE baseband can work on any of the LTE frequencies (and then some) but specific handsets will have filters for the appropriate region the handset is sold in. While you can change these it's just easier and cheaper to use something like a USRP.<p>If your interested in radio at all I suggest you start liking into ameture radio.

Yes, it goes for ridiculous prices when you can find one, but it's a unique keyboard in that it combines three characteristics, it's a space saver keyboard (if you leave out the numpad), it's got an excellent and highly adjustable ergonomic layout, and it's mechanical (brown MX switches). The feel of the keys isn't as good as a model M, but on the whole I enjoyed using it more.<p>That being said, while I have an MX5000, it's stored away and I just end up using the keyboard on my Thinkpad (the new Lenovo island style keyboards are slowly growing on me).<p>It's fun talking about keyboards because they invoke a near fetishistic fixation with people who spend their days using one, but in the end it's just a personal choice.",1365941582

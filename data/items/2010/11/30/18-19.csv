1955028,comment,1954057,1954676,0,0,ionfish,,,"To my mind there are several explanations for this phenomenon. Firstly, writing in mathematics is generally more graphic than programming, which is linear, although of course, mathematical writing can be expressed linearly (in TeX!).<p>Secondly, of course, most mathematical is relatively informal. The large proportion of strange symbols should not overly impress us: even in the best journals, mathematical proofs are not given as step-by-step logical deductions from the axioms. This is for the obviously sensible reason that such (excessively) formal proofs would be vastly longer and essentially incomprehensible to even the most gifted mathematician. [1]<p>Thirdly, programs have a constructive flavour to them: we work with finite objects (floating-point numbers rather than real numbers, for example) and any object or inference made by the computer is something we can understand in a finitistic way, even if it might take us a very long time to do so. In understanding the operation of the computer (even if only through a high-level programming language, rather than machine code) we see how each step of a computation is to be carried out. The algorithmic character of computation appeals to our intuition: if we wished to sit there and perform each step in a construction then we would get the expected result.<p>Of course, this last reason is much of the motivation behind Brouwer's intuitionism, and there is presumably a reason that so many computer scientists take a constructivist line of one sort or another.<p>[1] See, for example the calculations in this Math Overflow answer: <a href=""http://mathoverflow.net/questions/14356/bourbakis-epsilon-calculus-notation/31778#31778"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathoverflow.net/questions/14356/bourbakis-epsilon-ca...</a>",1291141408

This hash is your domainname.<p>Then you timestamp your zonefile and sign it with your private key. Afterwards, you store the result in a DHT under the key of the hash generated earlier. DHT nodes responsible for your data verify that your signature corresponds to your public key and that your public key corresponds to the hash.<p>As a last step you need a way to retrieve the data: The first possibility is to use your own local resolver on your PC that queries the DHT. An alternative would be to have several public resolvers that make this data available under different subdomains.<p>Supporting non-hash domainnames is somewhat harder due to security problems (if you want to have a fully decentralized solution). However, it might be possible to do this with an approach similar to Bitcoin's, where a block-chain is used to store transactions.",1291140916

In the current implementation there are too many ways for refinements to leak out of their defined context, granted it could be argued that this makes refinements more powerful, but it also undermines their very purpose (ie. isolating code).<p>I'm not a Ruby internals expert, but I've done my fair share of meta programming and debugging of monkey-patch conflicts.  A more static version of refinements will give 99% of the benefit while avoiding most of the landmines Charles is describing.  The other 1% can probably be served by adopting some other technique rather than looking to refinements.  Ruby is already such a dynamic and powerful language that it seems silly to say that refinements need to have this uber-flexibility.  All they need to be able to do is isolate monkey patches within a library and they've already provided a huge practical benefit.  Being able to inject refinements into someone else's code?  That's just not very important, and if it is for some particular case there are other techniques Ruby affords you, all of which should be used cautiously.<p>Barring some flaw in Charles' analysis, I'd say it's a no brainer that refinements need to go back to the drawing board.",1291140888

Although I believe there is net public harm from US post-9/11 ""security"" policies, when you consider that: \na.) the spending being done on security is entirely public deficit spending not offset by tax increases or cuts in other departments, \nb.) the economy has been well below full employment (~58-62% employment-pop ratio during the period) and full capacity utilization (~68-81% capacity utilization during the period), \nc.) no other expansion of public employment and spending would have likely occurred in the past decade absent the 9/11 attacks (arguable, but there really isn't a political consensus for expanding the US welfare state),\nand posit that the 2000s growth rate would have taken essentially the same path absent the 9/11 attacks, then it would appear that much of the security theater policies have had a small medium-term stimulative economic effect (small because it is largely offset by increased consumer travelling expenses and time, dampening productivity).\nThe three keys I mention above violate the pretext of the broken window fallacy (at least in the medium term, and probably in the long-term because of historically low interest rates). In a full employment situation, there would be significant deadweight loss, and in a balanced budget situation, there would be significant economic impact due to either increased taxation or offsetting spending cuts. But neither of those conditions applies to the recent US situation. The BWF assumes that the money would have been spent doing something else (more profitable), and I am pretty certain that will not be the case until the debt needs to be paid, which is unlikely to ever occur (I think the assumed future policy is to continue to roll the debt over until the singularity).",1291140122

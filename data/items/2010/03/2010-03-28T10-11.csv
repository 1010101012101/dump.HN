On Windows, I like PHPDeveloper personal edition for an IDE. It's cheap (or free, I can't recall).<p>PHP is mainstream, and since it's a web technology, she can likely show it off to her friends. It's not hard to find cheap PHP hosting if she ends up building something that she wants to put on the public-facing Internet for friends or strangers to use. XAMPP also comes with MySQL pre-configured, which is a bonus.<p>I cut my teeth on Logo and BASIC as a youngster.

Tab-completion works with this too.<p>Not to downplay autojump -- I just prefer this approach since I explicitly control all the directories I want quick access to, and my `cd` command is deterministic (assuming I name directories to avoid conflicts).",1269773755

1224439,comment,1224306,1224306,0,0,_delirium,,,"Open-source developers often want to develop on Linux, or at least to be able to release cross-platform stuff that will work on Linux, and Microsoft's toolchain is generally not oriented in that direction. If you use their dev tools, you're usually just building a Windows .exe, and if you want to port, it's going to be extra effort. There are of course Windows-only open-source projects, and they do actually often use an MS dev toolchain.<p>I think if Microsoft had (especially earlier on) been somewhat friendlier with the cross-platformness of .NET, either with their own releases or by helping Mono be a more compatible option, it would have more uptake, because technically it's actually pretty nice.",1269773553

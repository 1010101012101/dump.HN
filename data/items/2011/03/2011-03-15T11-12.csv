2327027,comment,2326545,2326545,0,0,jasonmorton,,,"I think Tex is wonderful just as it is. It does have a learning curve, like any powerful system, but so does e.g. html+css or any programming language. Emacs is a great editor and I run it with a simple inotify script to get automatic compilation. The error messages could be better, but that too comes with experience; I can almost always tell exacty what is wrong from the error message. Tex is so well suited to the purpose of producing mathematical documents that I really think asking for a modern replacement is like asking for a modern replacement for HTML. If you are not interested in becoming an expert user, go with a front end (the equivalent of frontpage or dreamweaver or similar). For the heaviest users, learning Latex is not a big deal relative to the other arcane knowledge one must acquire to write something worthwhile with it.  As others have said, the investment is paid off in beauty, speed, and control.",1300190364

The other 5 are closer to 1GW. Big wind turbines (at least here in .au) are rated at ~2MW peak, but with 15-30% utilization (the wind doesn't always blow at just the right speed to provide the amount of power you're using). That means the littlest reactor at Fukushima daiichi would need about 1000-1500 large wind turbines to replace it, and the 10 reactors in the two Fukushima complexes would need 20,000 or 30,000 400 foot diameter turbines on 250 foot tall pylons. That needs a _lot_ of space.

2326975,comment,2322666,2324371,0,0,waterhouse,,,"As a matter of fact, there are contexts where writing numbers in octal is not just ""beautiful"", but useful, and is <i>actually done</i>.  See asciitable.com and the Unix chmod utility (chmod 755 script.sh) for some common examples off the top of my head.  And, of course, programmers and computer scientists deal with numbers in binary and hexadecimal all the time, and you <i>do</i> find numbers written in such bases in academic and other papers.<p>Also, the question ""How many factors of the prime p are in n factorial?"" is easy to answer if n is written in base p (0 * [ones digit] + 1 * [p digit] + (p+1) * [p^2 digit] + (p^2+p+1) * [p^3 digit] + ...), and one can take this in the other direction--""Find the smallest n for which p^k divides n""--without much difficulty.  This is how I'm planning to answer a particular Project Euler problem, and if I were writing up my solution, I would write some numbers in base p.<p>Methinks you picked a really bad example to illustrate your point.<p>The things I find harder to do in bases other than 10 are: recognize numbers (primes/squares/cubes/triangular/Fibonacci/pentagonal/etc), factor them, do arithmetic (though I'm fairly accustomed to doing it in binary), and judge magnitudes.  If a paper dealt with these things, and there were no apparent benefits to using octal or whatever but the paper used it anyway, then I'd probably be annoyed.  This is probably what you meant to refer to with your example.<p>Now, you said the numbers would be written in octal ""for the sake of beauty"".  I don't know why someone would find it ""beautiful"" to write numbers in octal unless they turned out simpler for some reason--e.g. if all the numbers in question turned out to only have the digits 0 and 3.  Which would either be a coincidence--and in that case I think a mathematician would find it <i>disappointing</i> rather than <i>beautiful</i>, to see a pattern which turns out <i>not</i> to be robust or to reflect any underlying truth--or it would be the result of some underlying truth, in which case it likely <i>would</i> be better to write it in base 8.  The optimal strategy in two-player Nim is best understood and implemented when the numbers in each pile are written in base 2, because you need to compute XORs.<p>Many of the arguments for tau are based around beauty, yes.  This is because many of the arguments for <i>pi</i> are based around beauty.  However, there are also usability arguments, which seem to address what you're concerned with.  I don't think you can disagree: that it is <i>easier</i> to know of the 3rd and 6th roots of unity as cis(τn/3) and cis(τn/6), instead of cis(2πn/3) and cis(πn/3)--or cis(2πn/6)); easier to reason that a wheel that makes 12 rotations in 5 seconds spins at a rate of 12τ/5 radians per second, rather than 24π/5 radians per second; and easier to remember formulas and facts involving τ... ok, this one seems disputable, but I think I can actually argue for it.<p>If the only formulas that existed had ""2π"" printed right on them, then you could accustom yourself to treating ""2π"" as an atomic concept, and it wouldn't make much difference if we wrote them with ""2π"" or ""τ"".  However, instead, we have a bunch of formulas with 2π, a fair number of formulas with [some factor]π (e.g. ""Coulomb's constant k = 1/(4πε)"" and ""volume of sphere = 4/3πr^3""), and a couple of formulas with π by itself.  This is three patterns to recognize and remember, as opposed to two: τ and [some factor]τ. [1]  And your attempts to interpret 2π as a thing in itself will be confounded by your need to interpret π as a thing in itself, both when you think about the formulas with [some factor]π, and when you manipulate expressions and do arithmetic.  (We saw above the results of plugging k=6 into 2πn/k; note that this kills the 2π abstraction <i>even though</i> the formula has 2π.)<p>Basically, your understanding of the circle constant will be fragmented into π and 2π.  This was true for me even before I read ""The Tau Manifesto"", perhaps (not sure) before ""π is wrong"".  If you think in terms of π, you're bound to notice the 2π in the underlying pattern when it comes up; you try to put everything in terms of 2π, and you become disappointed when it fails to simplify some expressions (the 1/(4πε) becomes 1/(2(2π)ε)), and frustrated when arithmetic demands that the 2 be cancelled (obscuring the underlying 2π).  You'll probably try for a while; give up, somewhat dissatisfied; and then forget about trying to make sense of the situation.  Whereas with τ, you never ever need to think about whether or not this 3π/4 is better represented or thought of as 3/8(2π), whether you should cancel out factors of 2, whether ""2π 4π 8π 16π"" is really π * 2^n or 2π * 2^(n-1); the cases where the circle constant stands by itself appear without any special arithmetic tricks, and the cases where it's stuck with baggage are immediately plain.<p>There's probably a reason physicists came up with an entire <i>symbol</i> to represent Planck's constant divided by 2π.  It just <i>sucks</i> when your atomic concept isn't an atomic symbol and is likely to get broken up or partially destroyed by arithmetic.<p>As I've written this, I've become convinced that things really would have felt much better and nicer had I been using τ.  So it is important, it makes a significant difference; and this, plus external support (today's event, upvotes, friends' approval, and Vi Hart's video) make me more confident that we will succeed in changing it.<p>[1] As a side note, what makes the formulas with τ beautiful--or any formulas in general--is the same thing that makes them easier to remember.  Fewer different patterns to deal with.  Running the set of all formulas in your head through a compression utility would probably produce a smaller output.",1300189433

Of course, it costs more money.</i><p>Consider two possibilities.<p>One: design the reactor so that a magnitude-9 quake leaves it completely undamaged. Let's say that makes it cost $4B instead of $2B.<p>Two: design the reactor so that a magnitude-8.2 quake leaves it completely undamaged and a magnitude-9 quake (which might affect it, let's say, once per 200 years on average) makes it fail in a way that takes 100 lives and requires it to be completely rebuilt (to the same spec, let's say) at a cost of $2B.<p>Cost of option 1: $4B now. Nothing more. Cost of option 2: $2B now. $2B and 100 lives in another 200 years.<p>Suppose your discount parameter is 0.5% per year (much, much lower than just about any real person or institution uses). Then $2B + 100 lives in 200 years = $740M + 37 lives now.<p>Can you save 37 lives for $260M? Why yes, you can. Far more than 37 lives, in fact. If you do anything reasonable with $260M you may well save more than 37 lives just by (say) making everyone a little better off. (Wealth correlates with health.)<p>Therefore, option 2 is probably better.<p>Turning from hypothetical examples to the real world: $2B/$4B is probably an underestimate (in which case, the advantage of option 2 over option 1 is greater) and 100 lives is probably an overestimate (in which case, again the advantage of option 2 is greater).<p>On the other hand, the earthquake happened improbably early in the life of the plant. It is <i>not an error</i> to do things that work out well in almost all cases but badly when you get unlucky, when the alternative is something that works out (relatively) badly most of the time but well when you get unlucky.",1300189426

Left to its own devices the fuel will boil out the pool, light on fire, and then you have burning nuclear waste drifting directly into the atmosphere (after all, the buildings no longer have roofs).

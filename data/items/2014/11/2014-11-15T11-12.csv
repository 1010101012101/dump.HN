This is in fact one of the rationales behind both countries having price-fixing laws: namely, to preserve the profit margin for bestsellers to make such cross-subsidies possible.<p>You can argue whether that is fair (I know there are plenty of French and German readers who&#x27;d rather have cheaper bestsellers instead of books by new authors that they may never read), but both countries have a healthy book publishing industry.<p>So, while this may not have worked in Israel, in France and Germany plenty of books are being published, bought, and read. In fact, Germany publishes more books per capita and year than the US, even though German publishers can&#x27;t easily sell to the much bigger international English language market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per...</a>",1416052384

Because FTL signalling inherently means causality is broken.

Special Relativity is validated every time anyone uses GPS, for example, and the prediction that FTL implies travel back in time is inherent to what Special Relativity is.<p>So I&#x27;m not going to take you at your word.

8611460,comment,8611045,8611045,0,0,a3_nm,,,"To give some more information about the French perspective here:<p>- No source is given for the claim that &quot;The French government has declared books an &#x27;essential good.&#x27;&quot;, I have been unable to find any French source about this, and I am entirely unaware of such a declaration. I would be interested if anyone could point me to more information about this.<p>- There is a fixed price law on books, which to my knowledge has nothing to do with them being considered &quot;essential&quot;. The way it works is that the book publisher sets the final sale price of the book that will have to be applied everywhere (<a href=""https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_relative_au_prix_du_livre);"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_relative_au_prix_du_livre)...</a> a maximal rebate of 5% is permitted, which in practice is applied everywhere (except for online sales, see below). This is not unique to France and exists in several countries (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_book_price_agreement#Scope"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_book_price_agreement#Sco...</a>). My understanding of the point of this measure is that it reduces competition between booksellers, allowing smaller booksellers to survive, and allowing them to offer rarer books than just blockbusters.<p>- There is a cultural attachment to smaller bookshops, and a dislike of large foreign players (Amazon) even compared to large French players (Fnac, Gibert-Joseph, etc.). The smaller bookshops claim that Amazon&#x27;s free shipping poses a great threat to their existence. Free shipping was challenged by the French Booksellers Association, ultimately unsuccessfully (<a href=""http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2008/05/15/954-le-prix-du-livre-n-inclut-pas-le-prix-du-timbre-poste"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maitre-eolas.fr/post/2008/05/15/954-le-prix-du-li...</a>). Recently, however, a law was passed to achieve the same results, with online booksellers being forbidden to offer free shipping (hence Amazon.fr charges 0.01 EUR shipping for books) and being forbidden to offer the 5% discount.

Of course, one could also argue that online bookselling makes books more easily available to the end consumer (and faster, say, than asking a library to order your books for you); but the problem is that the role of booksellers, to select interesting books and guide you in your choice, is lost.",1416050917

This is the first time something like this has happened, but with the results, actually knowing a lot of variables, not even from the lander itself other missions will have something to base their work upon.<p>The first programming languages (static, duck typed, ...), database systems, web frameworks, anonymization frameworks, ... all had a lot of things that were either far from perfect or are now considered stupidity. But when nobody did what you did, when you are a pioneer everyone following would be a fool not to look at your work.<p>Also a nice example: Operating Systems. In the early days they were considered a waste of energy, time, resources.

Memory flipping is one of the most visible, but that radiation also will damage the lattice of the processor, making some transistors harder to flip on, and some much easier to flip on, leading to transient glitches, etc.<p>Redundancy&#x27;s definitely one solution, which is one reason why spacecraft tend to have multiple processors and/or processors with redundant logic pipelines. They also tend to use different substrates that are harder for cosmic rays to effect, different, more expensive, casings that offer more shielding, and also larger, older, more vetted processes. For example, this chip is uses a 1 micron process, which is a lot bigger than the process used in current cpus, which means that there&#x27;s a lot more mass in the transistors to soak the effects of radiation, making it harder to cause damage.",1416049876

Something you have familiarity with is going to be a lot easier to contribute to, because you will notice bugs, or think up a feature.  Like I added an option to a vim plugin I was using that was open source, and then sent a pull request because I thought someone else might like it, and it got accepted.<p>Another good thing to do is to write documentation for code before you contribute to it.  Plenty of code lacks clear documentation, and having to read the code and understand it will help you contribute later.",1416049585

If you look at something like Intel Thread  Building Blocks or even CUDA, you will recognise that at its heart it really is a functional programming model. I mean sure in the case of CUDA you can try to write the same variable multiple times, but in reality to preserve parallelism you would not implement for example matrix multiplication by overwriting one of the matrices in the process. Moreover a more functional / mathematical view on most HPC actually yields additional insight on how to parallelise a problem.",1416049410

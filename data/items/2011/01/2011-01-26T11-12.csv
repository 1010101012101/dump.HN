If I needed a CMS, I wouldn't limit myself to something built on Rails.  Sure, you may need to extend that CMS and you want not want to do anything in PHP, but you should be able to do small modifications easy enough.  If you need anything big modifications, then perhaps you would be better off building something from scratch.<p>Also consider the goals of a CMS vs your own goals as a developer.  A CMS needs to be flexible for non developers to handle a wide range of tasks.  Your own system only needs to handle the basics but be easily extendable (something which Rails should largely bring by itself.)  In other words, Rails is already a very basic CMS.<p>Otherwise, I can't answer the question of ""what's the best CMS"" in general because different systems are better for different needs.  I imagine the Ruby / Rails options are the same.  You would likely be better off trying each of those that catch your eye and making a decision from there.",1296042764

2142963,comment,2142934,2142934,0,0,srean,,,"This is yet another post on text entry system targeted to (area) limited devices. Rather than posting it as a comment on an old thread I decided to make it into a standalone post.<p>The video is long, but I did not regret watching it. Here David Mackay, an information theorist, explains how one may input text through space limited devices. If only I could explain theoretical concepts as lucidly and as well as he does.<p>What interests me is that, Dasher, when adequately augmented, is even more appropriate for inputting programming text than say English. Though English has been modeled by (stochastic) context free grammars, its only an approximation. Whereas programming languages, fit it to a 't'. Mackay mentions that English has an entropy of around 1 bit per letter and that a finger is usually capable of generating 14 bits per second. Source code, I believe, has significantly less entropy than English (this depends on the language of course).<p>I think lisp is a good language to target because the actual layout of the source code does not matter and can be automated. Also because it is such a thin layer above the AST and hence an ideal match for simple context free grammars. It is also advantageous that the first token of an s-expression has an overwhelming possibility of being drawn from a set of few key possibilities. Making the language's bit rate low.<p>There are several extensions that are possible. For instance given a code base, learn the coding style and adapt the model to it (including the style of generating identifier names). For new code bases, one may learn the model on the fly.<p>Finally, I like his analogy. Writing as an activity has had two dominant forms, (i) pushing buttons (ii) scribbling. Dasher is writing by navigating/driving efficiently through a library of all possible text. Depending on the style of your intended text one may re-arrange that library.<p>The only drawback I see is that it requires your attention, unlike say typing. But that might after all be a good thing.<p>Its released under GPL and available for free on iPhone as well <a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/MobileDasher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/dasher/MobileDasher.html</a>",1296042389

If I were trying to hire people at Twitter, I'd be annoyed to be wasting my time with candidates who wanted >0.1% equity for anything but super-senior engineering positions, and I'd be sad if I were hiring at Netflix and people didn't know about the great cash component in deciding to apply.<p>If your first interaction with a company is them trying to mislead and/or fuck you through inaccurate perceptions and lack of information, this does not bode well.",1296041732

This was the first time I've ever done exams or written anything (I was sleeping rough on streets when the peers I have now were being educated) and I feel good with the merit even though I kick myself at not finding that extra 1% somewhere.<p>What puts me off is a multi-faceted thing though:<p>1) That a late entry into academic and failing to get a distinction is going to count against me.<p>2) That my self-learning and lack of a strict appliance of a common vocabulary will sound bad in an interview (I felt in the exams that my struggle for the 'correct' term even though I knew what I wanted to express was not helping me get every point that I could).<p>3) That if 1) and 2) count against me, that a rejection will count against me in future (that Google collect and never forget data and that it would hurt a future chance when I might try again)<p>4) And then there's a deep concern with being in London... are the London engineers working on the same level of problem as the engineers in the US?<p>This last one is the real gnawing doubt... assuming I got through the interview, I'm not particularly interested in working in a body shop.

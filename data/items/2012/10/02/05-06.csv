4600749,comment,4597498,4600717,4,0,jacques_chester,,,"I have a feeling that your economic worldview is built out of mises.org articles.<p>Central banks vary wildly in their policies and work differently. Generalising from the Federal Reserve to other banks is troublesome.<p>For example, the Fed is very secretive compared to some banks. An enormous amount of effort is spent second-guessing it and it is nigh impossible to guess what it's going to do.<p>Meanwhile, in Australia, the Reserve Bank publishes its minutes, the Governor of the RBA makes regular speeches about monetary policy and its single policy objective (to keep underlying inflation in a 2-3% band) is widely understood and has never been deviated from. Markets and economists predict its next move correctly about 80% of the time.<p>Similarly, the Bundesbank and through their influence the ECB has well understood targets for monetary <i>and</i> fiscal policy; they've used monetary policy levers to affect the mix of taxation, spending and borrowing in the direction of financial rectitude. I don't think that's the right way to go about it, but everyone knows what they want and how they intend to do it. Super Mario's announcement of unlimited bond purchases is the first time the Bundesbank has been sidelined.<p>The USD is not the only reserve currency -- most central banks hold a mix of special drawing rights, USD, EUR, other currencies and yes, some still hold a bit of gold. You don't hedge risk through putting everything in the gold basket and betting on fluctuations in demand and supply that have no relationship to the general economy. You spread your risk onto multiple currencies.<p>Anyhow, it seems like we agree that the price of oil is rising. It's just that you see it as due entirely to the massive increase in the USD supply in past years; I'm saying that some of it is related to basic supply/demand as well and we can see this by examining its movement in other currencies.",1349157202

Assuming Dalton is being truthful in his post, he's not cutting prices because he ""didn't get traction"" he's cutting prices because his business model is out performing his expectations, and rather than go for a higher net early on he's re-investing that margin into growing the user base.<p>Tent is going 'old school' like the old IETF protocols, that means waiting for adoption, having a variety of implementations, establishing a consensus, moving forward. That works great in a green field situation, but this isn't it. Look at the OpenMoko effort, free Phone OS, build it and they will come? No. Reaching too far without a model to nourish early adoption and growth. Influential? Sure but killer? Not so much.<p>Dalton has something which Tent does not, people willing to spend money to use it. That is why I think Tent will be a memory long before we see the end of App.net.",1349156683

I can't speak to the podcast but I highly recommend the transcript.<p>My takeaways:<p>(1) If you are an expert in something and are disciplined enough to set up a consistent routine for writing you can probably write an ebook.\n(2) At least for designers you probably don't need to sell in any format but pdf.\n(3) If you want to maximise your reach or the growth in your personal brand it may be best to sell something at impulse buy levels.\n(4) To maximise the cash you earn directly, in sales, you should offer different packages at different price points.\n(5) Both of these authors spent significant time and money (works out very similarly) on layout, look and feel, different formats.<p>Personal commentary<p>Ebooks do not need to be that long, at least technical ones. Sometimes books can be dense or have content that is valuable not because it's hard to understand but because rediscovering it yourself takes valuable time. I don't think either author put in more than 200 hours work; I don't believe either put in more than 150.<p>You should offer at least three packages if you're price segmenting. This has two purposes, the middle package looks totally reasonable compared to the premium one but if you only have more or less impulse buy and middle people will go impulse. The bigger reason is that most of your money will come from people buying the complete package for whom real actionable advice saves them their time and money, or people with corporate credit cards for whom the difference between $50 and $150 is non-existent.<p>I doubt if having more than five packages helps because that's about the limit of gradations people can hold in their heads intuitively rather than as abstractions. The reasoning for three packages is given above, anchoring. Probably a good idea to a/b test it.",1349156379

All currencies have depreciated in value by central bank inflation.<p>The only difference is the degree to which the currency has been devalued.  Swiss Franc - not so much until recently (in repsonse to Euro devaluation).  Argentinian Peso - lots.<p>This is not really an argument - all Central banks have inflation as one of their core aims - it's just a matter of degree how much inflation they have created.  We are in an era of competitive currency devaluations when even the Swiss are getting in on the act.<p>The USD is different because it acts as the world reserve currency, and the one in which oil is priced.  It used to have a quasi-link to gold until Nixon closed the Gold window, which, unsurprisingly dropped the value.<p>>Gold is not a sensible measure of value because gold is not a currency. It is a metal with multiple competing uses, only one of which is as a store of value.<p>It's more sensible than paper money as a store of value over the long term.  The mean failure rate for paper currencies is 100% - it's just a matter of measuring the longevity.<p>But you don't have to use Gold to compare.

Her sisters never went to work. She always found that amazing, that a few individuals can spend their whole life doing nothing. Yet now when you talk to my aunts they live in their own world where they have every reason in the world why not working is right. When they both talk about it, men and their influences rarely pop up. Its always discussions about work life balance, stress, affects on kids and own physical and biological selves.<p>In my opinion the bigger struggle in empowering women will not be to counsel men, but women themselves. Most women who don't go to work do for their own reasons, and not because men don't want them to work. If you can convince women to come out of their comfort zones, take risks, try and even taste failure at times. Let me tell you women will be far well off.<p>But there are always going to jobs which are going to very demanding for women. There are also security issues with respect to working and traveling late nights, pushing very tough long work hour schedules.

Without the temporary exclusion that patents provide, there would be no way to recoup this cost.<p>I am firmly of the opinion that patents are used for this because no legal alternative has been provided.  But it is easy to imagine a more targeted property right for this case that would serve the same purpose as patents, except more efficiently.  And my standard example of an inefficiency of the current situation is that there is good evidence that hookworm is an effective treatment for Crohn's disease, but since hookworm is not patentable, there is no prospect that this treatment will ever get evaluated.",1349155324

4600671,comment,4599796,4599796,4,0,zacharyvoase,,,"I've worked in a few small organizations where the decision was made to build a new product using a service-oriented architecture. Not a single time did this prove to be a good idea. I now get instinctively wary of anyone extolling the virtues of SoA on a small team.<p>Here's what usually happened:<p>* Testing got slow. Rather than just running a bunch of tests with nose or pytest, you had to provision a number of services, sometimes on a VM or build slave.<p>* Testing got bad. Because services have enforced privacy, you can't test or mock their internal states, so you have a bunch of happy path functional tests but much less in the way of comprehensive unit and integration tests.<p>* Communication deteriorated. In a perverse corollary to Conway's law, our team struggled to maintain a system that didn't mirror its own structure.<p>* We spent a long time re-implementing basics (auth, JSON serialization, parallelization), and less time building product. This was always justified to the product owners as a necessary short-term sacrifice, but it ended up being a long-term sacrifice too.<p>* Security failed -- distributed systems are harder to secure than monolithic ones, and most of the small companies trying to execute SOA don't have a clue about application security. The fact that they don't have robust implementations of common components available to them (because auth is now handled as a service, for example) doesn't help.<p>* Performance degraded: HTTP, JSON and TCP are slow compared to passing around objects in memory and pushing to the stack. They always will be. Most people forget that the database is more than a dumb repository of tuples, and thus end up reinventing the relational algebra in JSONonly with horrendous performance.<p>* Reliability was hurt. The idea that you have multiple services that can each go down without affecting the whole system is an absolute pipe dream. If the database goes down you can't do anything. If the web server segfaults, no one can see your site. End of. And things are far more likely to fuck up when you try to build a distributed architecture. You probably don't have the time or money to implement the correct provisioning or monitoring either, so when stuff does break you're gonna have a really fun time discovering and debugging it.<p>These are just my experiences from being on teams of a few people. In larger organizations I'd postulate that SOA is the better approach. But please don't fall into the trap of buying SOA before you've reached a definite need for it.",1349154153

Especially with regard to patents.<p>Though not directly related to the position Posner takes in his most recent blog post, it's ironic to consider the fact that patents are filed not by the inventors themselves, but lawyers who represent them. To me, that begs the question of whether or not ""someone of ordinary skill in the art"" could actually replicate the invention disclosed in any given patent. In reality, depending on the invention, it doesn't seem likely that the inventor could even replicate her own invention using solely her patent as a guide. This is a result of patents that are too vague, too general, and too far removed from the actual technology they purport to disclose.<p>In his recent writing, Posner has chosen to make the point that companies use either defunct or trivial technology to halt innovation through patent litigation. Recently, the culprit has been Apple, but Apple is, of course, not alone. In the fight against patent bullying, Posner's conclusions are, for the most part, right on target.",1349154140

As an example, in context this could mean site version B, retains visitors longer and results in higher conversions. Therefore, UX version B 'wins' right?<p>What's the problem here? Perhaps it should rather look like this:<p><i>f(A,B,C) = [Ax,By,Cz]</i><p>Forgive me if the notation is a bit unusual, but the idea is you end up with 3 different UX's. 3 'best' versions of the website, that are always live, simultaneously. Or if you had a bimodal preference group, you would end up designing 2 UX trees. The number of clusters or 'groups' does not matter, only the fact that clusters <i>exist to begin with</i>.<p>We need to move away from the idea there is a single 'best' version of an interface. More often than not preferences when batched together (in the form of a product, app or whatever), do not form a neat normal distribution, even if approximating that is convenient.<p>A/B testing so highly regarded because it <i>works</i>. As effective as it is, (if used right), I believe we can do better.<p>Malcolm Gladwell eloquently expands on this concept, using an example from the spaghetti sauce industry, with further detail. I strongly encourage you to check it out, if you haven't yet, it's awesome!<i>[1]</i><p>This same idea of clusters applies for taste in movies,books,foods, which faces we find beautiful and almost anything really when looking at a population. Taste in website UX preferences is no different.<p>So the optimal webapp of 2020, is one that automatically knows which clustering a visitor falls into and presents a version of the site that makes them most comfortable, based upon UX decisions that align well to his/her group.<p>The current approach in software tries to shoot for a middle ground compromise, and in addition using a settings or preferences panel that the user needs to tweak. This could be considered suboptimal as more effort is required from users.<p>Example: There is a reason that UI animation annoys me (and others), to the point I'm willing spend hours researching how to hack the O/S, in order to turn it off. Clearly however, there exists other groups for whom it looks good, and there is no issue.<p>Why these clusters/groupings exist at all could be a combination of differences in our neurocognitive functions, and the summation of experiences over our lifespans.<p><i>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce.html*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce...</a>",1349154048

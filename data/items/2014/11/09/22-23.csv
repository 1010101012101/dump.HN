It was very close to profitability in a huge market (China) with enormous growth potential. The problem was I needed to run around doing non-fun business stuff (raising capital) and double-down for another few years to see it through. If I had, I&#x27;d be rich now. But I chose not to, and have no regrets. So where did life take me? In short: better places - more money, less stress, family, leisure, travel. Find what you want out of life (hint: loads of money is rarely it) ... work smarter not longer.",1415573911

Without him, you simply have no forwarding address.<p>If your batz wizardry is sufficient and ~zod is not there (both of these are things that we are not counting on being true when you run Urbit for the first time) you will still get the same result in your terminal, you can reach out and contact other carriers and their friends, even without ~zod.  They just can&#x27;t find you.  And you need to find another way to bootstrap your clay (filesystem) if you care about having local clay.<p>Think about the difficulty of coordinating multiple stakeholders, compared to the ease of explaining the &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model that most of computing is really based on today.  If the only thing that ~zod needs to do is point submarines at one another and facilitate the existence of other signing ships under his domain, that&#x27;s very easy.  Doing those things without ~zod&#x27;s cooperation will require some further thought and more explanation.<p>I am a carrier owner (~del) and I count on ~zod to make it easy for new subs to find me.  It&#x27;s very convenient this way.  But, anyone who knows how to type:<p><pre><code>   :~del/main=/bin/hi ~dalnel\n</code></pre>\n... can also reach out to my carrier and run &quot;hi&quot; (become mmy neighbor) to find ~dalnel with my help, and exchange keys with him (~dalnel is the cruiser, like ~zod&#x27;s ~doznec).<p>~zod never needs to get involved.

If they repeatedly searched her at the border (thus essentially abusing an avenue which had its legal hurdles significantly reduced for the ostensible sake of national security and being able to deal with external threats that the internal legal system had no time and opportunity to handle through regular channels) but did not choose to obtain a warrant or otherwise start a legal process that comes with the normal set of safeguards, I&#x27;d say that strongly seems to indicate they did not have enough of a case against her - or, in other words, that an investigation was perpetuated which according to traditional legal standards should have been discontinued.<p>Now, of course you may argue for the traditional standards/safeguards themselves to be weakened (e.g. by saying that while searches of one&#x27;s home should remain subject to the same legal restrictions, certain parts of the government now also shall have the privilege to conduct some sort of &quot;preliminary searches&quot; which do not come with the usual safeguards to arbitary ends which might include a more formal investigation being started, at their full discretion), but this is not how I usually see this debate being framed.",1415571180

8581069,comment,8576936,8580045,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"&quot;Interface&quot; is an overloaded word, which muddies the waters quite a bit. It&#x27;s even more confounded by the fact that one type of interface (APIs) are used in code that often compiles down to another type of interface (protocols/ABIs).<p>In my mind, this difference is critical, because at a binary level (byte code, IR, assembly, what have you), the actual human-readable names don&#x27;t matter. At the binary level, the interface essentially is nothing more than a bunch of bytes representing offsets into other byte arrays representing code, and yet more bytes arranged at other offsets representing arguments. Whether that code was generated from &quot;File.open(fname)&quot; or &quot;new File(fname)&quot; or &quot;open(fname, O_RDONLY)&quot; does not matter at all, because the final machine code (on x86) is essentially &quot;mov al,0; mov ah,3dh; int 21h&quot; (or the binary representation thereof).<p>As such, you could generate a binary that calls code represented by an API without using the API at all. But of course, nobody really does that because human-readable &quot;new File(fname)&quot; is so much more expressive (and more important, <i>much more readable</i>) than they bytecode for &quot;new #3; dup; aload_1; invokespecial #4&quot;. There is very limited potential for creative expression in a sequence of bytes and offsets, which is why it differs so greatly from APIs from a copyright standpoint. However, it is the <i>bytes and offsets</i> that is actually makes computer systems interoperable, not the names and organization of the APIs. Unfortunately, the Sega/Sony caselaw seems to exempt the former from copyright law, but the latter is what Google copied wholesale. Now Google, EFF et al are trying to conflate the two. (Of course, the fact that Android is not binary compatible with Java either is another hole in Google&#x27;s own defense.)<p><i>> ... APIs are not code at all... </i><p>One could make convincing arguments both for or against that, but it does not matter from a copyright perspective. From what I can tell, anything that is &quot;written&quot; and can have &quot;creative expression&quot; is protected by copyright. My point is simply that, unless some exception is carved out for it, APIs being copyrightable is currently completely consistent with what copyright is intended for.",1415570943

Hmm..., S.E. actually does it also via making comments smaller, via community guidelines and by removing formatting. I wonder if that can make sense in forum software.<p>Your mentioning &quot;suppressing discussion&quot; made me think about something, namely removing the discussion completely: collapsing long sub threads, and replacing them with auto generated summaries of the most interesting things therein, see: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8581040"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8581040</a><p>Actually I don&#x27;t understand &quot;What subject matter do you wish to approach&quot; (not a native English speaker). Could you please rephrase?",1415570442

Otherwise MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle etc. is probably fine.<p>NoSQL has an learning and &#x27;new technology&#x27; overhead that isn&#x27;t worth paying unless the pain of using traditional databases is too high.<p>Don&#x27;t forget SQLLite too - nice for the very small applications.",1415570439

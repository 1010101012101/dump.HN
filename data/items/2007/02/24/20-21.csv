In fact, especially if you know the solution to the problem.<p>The fact is, 99% of Internet users don't know they have an identity problem. And no matter how much they do, nothing you can do will convince them of this. Better to wait another five years and then tackle the problem. No one else will have solved it by then, trust me.",1172348931

914,comment,877,898,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Exactly. Some of the scientific studies are interesting, but it's not anything that you wouldn't know already after reading Emotional Intelligence and other similar books. Yes, choosing from twenty different types of toothpaste may be a pain, but that's hardly a good reason to adopt a religion to artificially limit your choice.",1172348722
913,comment,893,906,0,0,danielha,,,"Whenever there's a blog post about Y Combinator's summer funding, I always see TechStars and Lightspeed brought up or mentioned in the comments.<p>Comparisons will be made, naturally. There is a lot of discussion regarding the funding vs. share percentage ratio, some lamenting that there is such a high percentage being taken for a relatively small seed. If broken into pure numbers, I can see where one might draw that conclusion. But it seems many are then missing the point.<p>It's not the size of the check that's written, it's the support and backing, the advice from valley veterans, the valuable critique from those who understand this arena the most. It's the crucial foot-in-the-door process and the inherent buzz publicity you just can't buy.<p>And since it comes down to all that, I'd rather it be with Y's folks because these are names that I actually recognize along with a proven portfolio.",1172348708

911,comment,891,891,0,0,danielha,,,">> Many developers view software development (\n) as a science or engineering activity(\n) Writing software is neither: I view it as a craft or art, similar to the work required of teachers and writers. (\n) So itÂ’s not clear why we call software development software engineering. (\n)<p>The real issue is that some feel the need to strictly classify everything in distinctive categories. I would content that writing software IS engineering even in the strictest sense. But as a artful craft? It sure is. It all depends on the application, intent, and approach. ",1172347740

909,comment,638,638,0,0,epall,,,"On the other hand, sometimes your major sustainable competitive advantage is your IP. My current employer has developed an algorithm that pretty much blows anybody else out of the water for what we're doing and they most definitely don't want anybody else learning about it. Granted, their strategy is simply don't tell anybody (All I know is we have the algorithm, not what it is), but protection of IP can be important in some cases. If what you're protecting will be obvious once your product is out there, then yes an NDA is pointless. However, if you want to protect some behind-the-scenes technology that won't be  evident to anybody using your product, then an NDA may be in order.",1172347209

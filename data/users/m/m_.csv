A recent client was accepted to Y Combinator after I built their MVP.<p>In addition to full-stack development with Ruby on Rails and Ember.js, I can help you with product direction and feature development and even lead your team of developers. I also provide extended maintenance and understand the importance of writing succinct, maintainable code.<p>I&#x27;m a strong believer in automated testing which translates into a high quality product with little to no user facing bugs. This gives my clients an extremely high level of confidence when adding new features and deploying.<p>Beyond development, you will find that I need very little direction, have excellent communication skills and pay close attention to detail. 75% of my clients hire me to save their project after another developer failed to deliver.<p>So, if you need someone to design and build a high quality app, give me a call.<p>--<p>Portfolio: http://www.mcgintech.com<p>email: hn@mcgintech.com<p>phone: 415.857.3347<p>Matt McGinnis",1263916488,1452049930

Meganduma,0,1,0.0,0,2,"I founded www.YouTours.com after a trip to Southeast Asia in late 2010.  YouTours.com is a platform for sharing self-guided tours.  The Mission?  To make sure no good story goes untold.<p>Prior to that, I was a trial lawyer who loved to blog about wine (www.WineForBlondes.com), travel, and learn anything I could about the human experience.  In November, 2010, while traveling through Cambodia, I met a 45-year-old tour guide named Than who would change the course of my life's work.<p>Than had survived the brutal regime of the Khmer Rouge, a communist group which occupied Cambodia in the 1970's. His story was the most remarkable and heroic thing I'd heard in my life.  It was the best tour I had ever been on.<p>A day later, we traveled to Angkor Wat to check out the majestic temples, one of the eight wonders of the world. We hired a tour guide with high hopes that Angkor would reveal more amazing and touching stories.  Due to the lame tour guide, it did not.  Day wasted.  When we got back to our hotel, I googled, ""Audio Tours"" looking for self-guided tours of Angkor.  I couldn't find one site that worked, but rather a hodge-podge of sites with no common marketplace.  That was the birth of YouTours.<p>I wanted guides like Than to be able to share their stories, earn money, and make travel more enriching for everyone.  So, I raised a very small amount of seed funding, and www.YouTours.com was born.  The site has not been launched, but is in the last phases of development for its first launch.<p>I know this site has global reach and amazing potential to help both guides and travelers.  And I'd like to launch it big, loud, and far.",1317083832,

Mz,2,13032,2.27273,1138,4509,"I have started a public Twitter list called Women of HN. If you are a female member of HN, let me know if you wish to be added.<p>https://twitter.com/TalithaMichele/lists/women-of-hn<p>My actual name is Michele.<p>Why Michele is not my HN handle: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/03/mz-not-feminist-handle.html<p>Gmail: talithamichele<p>Twitter: @TalithaMichele<p>My websites:\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/p/my-sites.html<p>Me and Math:\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/08/me-and-math.html<p>---------------<p>On 01/29/15, my karma hit 10k. I believe that makes me the only woman here with karma in the 5 digits. If you would like to promote gender parity on HN:<p>If you are a female lurker, please open an account and start exercising your right to vote. Upvote articles you like. Upvote comments you like.<p>If you actively participate as an openly female member, here is the general formula I have followed for participating in discussion in good faith while minimizing the gender issue: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/01/oh-my-god-its-girl.html<p>Whatever your gender, try to post more good articles by women about substantive topics, such as this one that spent a good bit of time at #1, got a lot of upvotes, and generated good discussion:<p>A story about <input>  \nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10433793<p>I feel there is too much focus currently on women complaining about how they are treated and too little focus on actual accomplishments by women or on the work we actually do. I would like to see more positive attention focused on the work we do, less negative attention on &quot;women whining&quot; or attention focused on us &quot;because we are women per se.&quot; I think that only keeps the problem entrenched.<p>If you are a man, talk to women here about substantive, meaningful topics. Debate their ideas without being ugly or making it personal. Spare them the condescending pats on the head. In short, try to treat women like respected members of the community, here to discuss interesting topics, just like you would a man. (Please don&#x27;t hit on us publicly on HN. See my somewhat angry diatribe if you want to understand why: http://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/dont-ask-me-for-date-in-front-of-100k.html)<p>A big <i>Thank You</i> to the many people who seem to be doing more of the above good things these days.<p>If you have questions that are not answered by the Guidelines:<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html<p>or FAQ:<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html<p>do not hesitate to write to the new moderator, Dan Gackle (pronounced &quot;Gackley&quot;):<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dang<p>He has been consistently helpful, respectful, polite and patient in the face of my questions about proper titling and the like. I could not have roughly doubled my karma in 2014 (IIRC: going from about 4500 to something over 9000 points) without his very valuable feedback.\n---------<p>FYI:<p>I am still on the lookout for better terminology than &quot;Old Boys Club&quot; or &quot;Boy Zone&quot;. I loathe the expression &quot;The Patriarchy&quot; and I think it mostly does not fit the issues of gender disparity seen on HN. I can think of one or two men here who strike me as staunch supporters of &quot;The Patriarchy,&quot; but I think most men here are not actively trying to keep &quot;little women&quot; in &quot;their place.&quot; They are mostly just human beings, who happen to be male, who don&#x27;t know a better answer than the crappy situation we currently have. But, then, most women don&#x27;t have better answers either and have much more vested interest in finding such answers. I see no reason to vilify men for such a prosaic shortcoming of happenstance.<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9152104<p>----------<p><i></i><i></i>Recommended Reading on Gender and HN:<i></i><i></i><p>Some Raw Data on the Prominence of Women on HN\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/01/some-raw-data-on-prominence-of-women-on.html<p>Oh my god, it&#x27;s a girl!\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2014/01/oh-my-god-its-girl.html<p>Lessons learned as a girl gamer\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/lessons-learned-as-girl-gamer.html<p>In Search of a More Constructive Answer\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/in-search-of-more-constructive-answer.html<p>Don&#x27;t Ask Me For A Date in Front of 100k People\nhttp://micheleincalifornia.blogspot.com/2015/10/dont-ask-me-for-date-in-front-of-100k.html",1248010177,1452809385

Our content, designed in conjunction with educators and parents, is modular, and flexible enough for both home and classroom use. The library will be available to a web-based subscriber group, as streaming HD, with interactive elements.<p>MPL will give parents and teachers an accessible way to bring both technology and creativity into the everyday lives of ordinary children, no matter where they live. Our goal is that this early creative experience will help children to develop more fully, both emotionally, and in terms of their own ability to be creative  and to become comfortable with, and confidant in, their own creative and abstract reasoning abilities. In terms of early childhood education practices, MPLs innovation is nothing less than revolutionary.<p>In February 2010, MPLs Angel Round was fully subscribed, giving the company a pre-revenue valuation of 500K (US-$700K); further fundraising is now postponed until after the results of first user testing are in.<p>Junkyard Drumming  MPLs first full-length content module was filmed on 27 February in the Powerscourt Estate, just south of Dublin. Ned Dowd Directed, Robbie Harris taught the workshop, and a dozen children from Wicklow Educate Together National School went home with their own hand-made drums. With thanks to our production team  were delighted to say that Junkyard Drumming is now ready for user testing.",1255014681,1452889716

marak210,,13,0.0,20,4,"I started out my career on the help-desk at Intrahealth, a mission critical medical practice management software company that sells a product that is configurable and scalable to a large degree with the ability to customise using COM by writing macros and forms. We offer Windows, MAC, iOS and web solutions. I quickly moved up to application analysis and then moved to Sydney from Auckland to be the area manager for Australia. Our core product is very configurable with literally 1000s of options in each area; I was able to soak up all features and settings and became proficient in them quite quickly. This opened up many opportunities for me at Intrahealth, thats why I have been very involved in all facets of the company from the help-desk to training, implementation, testing, development, analysis and producing PCRs for bugs and new enhancements across the entire platform.<p>I am able to do all this because I am a curious person who always asks why? I am keen to learn and understand everything about the company I work for and the world around me, for me knowledge is power and that is very true for the workplace environment. Knowing the product and who can do what and best is very important. During my time at Intrahealth my passion was carved for product management, I have been labeled as a ""product guy"" and an ""outside of the box thinker"". I love software and I am passionate about changing it for the better with new ideas that strengthen the products feature portfolio and help simplify the product so that the user is delighted. I believe the product will sell itself if it's amazing, this is what I strive for... only the best. To do this I think strong passion is very important, together with strong communication with the team and great ideas combined produce great output.<p>My personal passion currently is in the mobile and social world, it's fast paced, it's exciting and it's now! I find looking into the future of technology to be limitless. I follow the startup scene around the world and look forward to starting my own technology company in the future to change the way the world is. Someday we will all be inspector gadget. I currently have 2 small Android app projects with a friend and part-own a small bar back in New Zealand. Currently I am trying to up skill by teaching myself how to code in JavaScript as a side project.",1334049642,1450207814

markklarich,0,29,0.0,5,24,"Im an accountant and a lawyer, specializing in micro and small businesses. I work (hack) the interrelationships between tax codes and business laws to the advantage of my small business clients.<p>I use unconventional but proven methods of business entity design. My solutions are creative, yet have been validated through an extraordinarily low audit rate and solidly successful appeals. My clients keep more in their pocket, yet achieve lower rates of risk.<p>My business model is hands-on. I'm a one-man shop and there's not even a receptionist between me and my clients. I act as advisor and confidant, offering very personal counsel so my clients can navigate major business decisions. I help them clear the financial hurdles involved in graduating to higher and higher levels of complexity.<p>Unlike other lawyers and accountants, I stay involved after the incorporation is filed, and I stay in contact between tax returns. I stay updated on the day-to-day operations and decision-making as much as possible, as much as the client chooses. And it doesn't take long for them to see the value of investing in my counsel.<p>There are legal and/or tax ramifications to almost every decision. Every new hire, every major expenditure, every decision about managing cash flow has repercussions. I've helped avert or minimize many significant tax and legal catastrophes.<p>I've helped a broad variety of businesses. Inventors, loggers, bakers, musicians, real estate moguls, optometrists, roofing contractors, academic researchers. But I'm new to tech start-ups.<p>I'm drawn to learn more about this community because I like being involved at the beginning when things are changing a lot and exciting. But also because I find coders to be kindred spirits. People who are self-motivated, who question assumptions, are extremely creative, and who strike out to build something new.<p>So I'm getting started, here at Hacker News. Reading and learning about what's important to the people inside this universe. What's exciting and inspiring, as well as where the headaches are.<p>At some point soon, I'll get started on a website and start blogging about tax and legal issues. Especially as they pertain to day-to-day decisions. I'll post the URL here when I get it started.<p>I also founded a musical group, D'moja, that introduced a lot of people to traditional hand drumming. You can see a clip here. My son Brandon is in the white T-shirt and I am in the glasses next to him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXr-jwKMfYw<p>Feel free to email me.\nmy username, gmail",1299736259,1452892847

maurice45,0,1,0.0,1,0,"brief summary _ a form of non - traditional soundscan<p>The New Music Exchange. (an indie music social network)\nThere are a few online music serves but what makes my site different then others ? \nThis story should help to explain.\ni'm dealing with an artist who signed a record deal with Sony Red. That means he's at the end of the road and his problems should be over but the new standard deal with unknown artists is the following - \nThe artist will have his cd mass produced for limited release and if the cds sell a certian number in limited release then Sony reserves the right to conside doing a larger run of cds and then promoting them through their network. So it's up ot the artist to advertise their own cds to reach the number because to prove they are a profitable group then they have to reach that number through ""soundscan"".\n(""soundscan"" is a system that records music sales)\nPlease keep in mind that if they don't sale a certain number then they get no support and also upon intially signing the deal they signed any most of their online music rights so even if the shelfed cds don't sell the record company can get paid from the onlie sales and keep most of the profits.<p>The New Music Exchange offers another option.\nAn artist goes to our site and uploads their music and lets fans know that they're on the site. Music fans look them up and if they like what they hear they download. \nNow we can give the artist back a demographic - \nwomen  between the ages of 17 - 25 \nlocation - brooklyn, New York\nhits - 20,000\ndownload - 17,523 \nbecause of this information an artist can now prove that they're profitable and it also gives them the option to go on tour and make money outside of theire original deal.\nThe service is free for music fans and independent artists however it's subscription based for industry accounts however a bulk of our revenue will come from advertising.\nThe site is more then a service - since we now have added NMX radio and NMX social it's more of independent music and information hub where we control content, advertising and promotion. We can even inform members when they're favorite band is in the area and we'll be upgrading to mobile base soon.\nWe are looking for $2m to move our brand further.",1334198512,1452901707

mbeihoffer,0,-17,0.0,1,9,"I'm a serial startup founder that has yet to hit it ""bigtime"". (I am not sure that I entirely want to, as it doesn't always seem to bode well for the company founders. But I digress.)<p>My main business entity consists of my co-founder and myself, and we own a half-dozen sub-entities, each of which is remarkable in that they are all equally more or less profitable (or not profitable, much, at all, depending on which way you want to look at things.)<p>We work very hard to obtain and retain clients, and most of our work revolves around building websites for small businesses. I am adept at PHP programming (11+ years) but much prefer to program in Perl (with Catalyst as my framework for web apps) to do heavy lifting.<p>That being said, since most of our clients generally choose one of our preferred open-source CMS solutions, I don't typically have to do much programming in either PHP or Perl to get our projects done. Mostly, I develop custom themes, install and configure plug-ins and modules, and provide branding expertise to our clients, while developing the sites in WordPress, Geeklog, Drupal, Joomla, or whatever-floats-their-boat.<p>Unsurprisingly, not very many clients of ours have the need or desire to invest in a 100% custom-coded Catalyst application for their website, which is fine by me. We are able to meet 90% of our client's needs with the aforementioned CMS solutions, in any case, and it's almost certainly much faster than it would be if we were coding custom apps for each clients (not to mention, much, much cheaper for the client.)<p>Sometimes I do miss getting my hands dirty doing hardcore object-oriented web application/Perl development. When that happens, though, I generally just check out one of our company's internal projects from our Subversion repository and see where I last left it. It's super fun to be able to develop a dozen websites that we own and host on our own servers, even if they're not exactly cash cows.<p>I guess it mostly works out ok, though, because work is steady if not stellar, clients are relatively stable, our projects are almost always successful, my business partner is a scholar and a gentlemen and is also very accommodating when it comes to things like taking the day off to play disc golf, re-investing some of our profits in more powerful servers, workstations, domains, etc, and is also pretty hilarious and a great guitar player, to boot. So running a startup is nothing if not entirely entertaining.<p>Also, he didn't require me to have a cell phone to be in business with him, which is cool, because I don't really enjoy cell phones as much as most people seem to (although I reluctantly just acquired one, and so far it's working out decently. I don't know if I <i>like</i> people being able to reach me all the time, but I suppose I can just ignore their calls if it gets to be too much.)<p>I like CSS. I like CakePHP, but prefer Symfony. And I like Catalyst waaaaay better than anything I've seen with PHP.<p>I like RSS. I like Plagger. I love WordPress. I don't mind Drupal, don't care much for Joomla, kind of miss using Geeklog, and have probably used whatever CMS you're currently thinking that I left out.<p>I used to read Slashdot, and Kuro5hin, and I blog in a bunch of different locations. Now I read Reddit sometimes, and also HN, obviously, but mostly I've been lurking around HN for many moons without signing up for an account, although somebody said some stuff today in some comments that I wanted to respond to, so I finally signed up for an account.<p>I think Perl code can be a heinous nightmare, especially other people's code, but I also think that well-educated and motivated Perl programming teams can generally arrive at rather sophisticated approaches for solving Perl's more problematic issues, and that if you get the right Perl people together, they will probably out-code just about everybody, including Django and Rails folk (but possibly not counting Haskell and/or Lisp folk.)<p>I do some database design work, and have become fairly adept at working with Perl's DBI (as well as accessing various DB's from PHP, which isn't nearly as fun or exciting to me for some reason.) I try to follow general RDBMS design best practices (whatever that means) and make sure that my designs are correctly normalized and whatnot.<p>(E.F. Codd, bless your soul, wherever you are now.)<p>I use OpenBSD on my IBM Thinkpad and also on all of our company's servers, and really couldn't ask for a better operating system for heavy lifting.<p>But I also really like Mac OS X quite a bit and am looking forward to acquiring a new Intel-based Mac workstation sometime in the near future. I use OS X where OpenBSD isn't so great, for instance, for multi-tracking, mixing, and mastering music, for playing around with various Adobe software when I'm feeling fancy (and when I get tired of the GIMP being dog-slow and painfully crashy when working on largish image files) and am very pleased about the fact that I haven't felt obligated to us a Microsoft Windows computer of any kind for many moons.<p>I do not hate Bill Gates nor am I insanely jealous of him or whatnot. Weirdly, I think he's an all right guy, but I think maybe he's in a little over his head at this point. Also, I think Internet Explorer is hilariously awful software and I'm really glad I don't have to use it any more.<p>Usually as a web developer you'd think I'd care about I.E. issues a little bit, but I don't really at all, much. I guess that if I was inflicted with I.E. for some reason I'd probably complain about it (<i>shakes fist</i> ""it doesn't follow W3C standards at all, damn you Bill Gates! etc etc"") except that as I just said, I don't have to use any Microsoft software at all anywhere in my life, so I am pretty much a happy camper, and as Douglas Adams would have said, I.E. is Somebody Else's Problem now.<p>Oh, yeah, I guess Open Source was indeed a revolutionary movement at the time (maybe it still is? I dunno.) because I couldn't do anything with computers <i>at all</i> were it not for the generosity and forward-thinking members of the Open Source community. (I am being completely serious here, I know you think I'm smirking as I write this part, but I'm not. Seriously.)<p>I rely on Open Source (do I have to keep capitalizing it? I think I am going to write it in lowercase from now on) in almost every single aspect of my life, both professionally and as a hobbiest, and come to think of it, I guess I couldn't do my job at all if it wasn't for open source software, and also, I'm not going to get all fanboyish or anything here, but I have a lot of respect for RMS. He is a very smart, very motivated, and very ethical person, even if that's kind of painted him into a corner these days and it is very tempting to make fun of him (or hate him, I guess) for any number of his foibles/crimes against humanity/zealotry/etc.<p>I also really like Steve Wozniak quite a bit. He's changed my life in massively positive ways, and I'm not going to gush or anything, but wow. I'd rather hang out with him than Steve Jobs any day of the week, I don't care how big the reality distortion field is.<p>And I also really respect and admire Bruce Perens, Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Paul Graham, Philip Greenspun, the Reddit crew, and the various other neat-o inhabitants of planet open source. They are cool people and are welcome to crash on my couch whenever they need to, as long as they are nice to my cat and my girlfriend.<p>I also really like what Google has done with their opportunity, I think they have a decent culture and ethos and I have come to rely on their work in many small ways over the years. I also hope they don't screw me over like Microsoft did, because they totally could. (Not that Microsoft is the only proprietary software vendor that's ever screwed me over, whether it was intentional or not. Adobe has also moved my cheese on occasion, and even Apple kind of held their customer base in pretty low regard back in the day, although they've certainly cleaned up their act since then. I have a long memory like an elephant though, so if you want to know who else is on my shit list, all you have to do is ask.)<p>I used to be a systems administrator for a bunch of law firms, and before that, I managed a fleet of laptops, workstations, servers, routers, switches, hubs, and other assorted crap for a gigantic national banking firm. I do not like systems administration very much, though. I do it for our company, of course, but that's about the extent of it these days. I'd rather be building fresh new websites for happy customers any day of the week than try to explain, well, <i>anything</i> else about computers to <i>anybody</i> ever again. Especially lawyers and bankers. Tough crowd.<p>(I still build websites for lawyers if they ask, though, and am happy to do it for them. Heck, I'm even still <i>friends</i> with some lawyers and bankers, remarkably.)<p>Our startup(s) has been in existence since 1998, so we're doing Real Well and should be making Lots of Money Real Soon Now. Weirdly, I do not miss working at the bank or being a systems administrator for law firms much at all.<p>I use Facebook and LinkedIn to hang out in the virtual sense, and I even kind of like Twitter. I don't really know why. I guess since I used the Perl Net::Twitter module to auto-tweet some of my song lyrics to my Twitter account every afternoon, I sort of feel complicit in the whole phenomenon. I don't really <i>read</i> many tweets, though, although that may change since I now have a phone.<p>Anyway, so, yeah. Here I am. My name is Mark Beihoffer (yep, that's my boring old blog at http://mark.beihoffer.com, seriously, it's my most boring blog, mostly because my mom reads it, but still. Don't read it unless you hate yourself or are truly interested in boring Catalyst fanboy posts) and I hang out here at HN and this About information is sort of almost totally honest, because apparently HN culture is such that people would like to verify the veracity of the information they are receiving from people's comments and whatnot. And also, I suppose people connect with other startup founders here, and what-have-you.<p>Cool beans.<p>Oh, also, lastly, I should mention that I am, according to recent medical advice, a little bit off-kilter, specifically, I have full-blown Bipolar Disorder, so, basically I am awake for four days in a row, then I sleep for several days in a row.<p>This can apparently be irritating to some people who would like me to show up to appointments on time, which I sometimes am unable to do. So if I don't respond to your comments in time and you are eagerly awaiting a flamewar with me, or if I actually do stand you up in real life because we had an honest-to-goodness real-life <i>appointment</i> of some kind or whatever, well, I apologize in advance.<p>(This does seriously happen sometimes, when I miss Important Meetings because I am asleep for four days in a row. I've gotten used to it by now, but apparently other people have not.)<p>Anyway, so, yeah. Howdy-do, good day to you!<p>- Mark Beihoffer<p>p.s. Oh, sorry if this is too long. I am not sure just how much information to put into text boxes these days. I usually just type until they are full, but this one never got full.<p>Go figure.",1243843061,1452887944

Beware of the solution that requires one side to be totally the loser and the other side to be totally the winner.  The reason there are two sides to begin with usually is because neither side has all the facts.  Therefore, when the wise mediator effects a compromise, he is not acting from political motivation.  Rather, he is acting from a deep sense of respect for the whole truth.""<p>~Stephen R. Schwambach",1207244346,1452501379

medicek,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Executive Summary<p>Overview of Project and Idea<p>This Internet and software project is the development of a practical and pragmatic synergistic paradigm-shift to the way people currently use the technology available to them. This is the introduction of a business concept developed by Derek Lowe, Proprietorship called IQ Mind Map. The venture team has developed a learning / educational Internet product that will serve the needs of its users through enriching their lives and relationships through technology when using this easy to use interactive E Learning program. The IQ Mind Map project can be seen as a facilitator to the future of the worldwide intelligent network and will usher in a deeper understanding and interaction with the meaningful world.<p>The Internet-related concept and application provides people with a single information management and processing system of their own to operate, for their personal growth and intellect. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Every users timeline can travel back to an entry for their birth.<p>Herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The concept will revolutionize how people empower themselves with the Internet. No longer will people have to fight the trends of commercialism, rather they can design their own path of customized learning and information management. The product will be sold as a personal / private blog template and Internet application that is then customized to the users benefit. This interaction allows the user to learn, remember and enrich their intellect through the power of the Internet. A virtual information road map, The IQ Mind Map will be the source for users to manage their life experiences satisfactorily; from basic day-to-day diary-based entries to manifested as a virtual road map of your life and intellectual growth.  The product is unique in the sense that it is continuously growing and evolving in tandem with the life of the user.<p>The concept puts the users life and intellectual growth as the focus.  Unlike the ubiquitous information gathering companies and social networking services, this project aims to define itself less as a social networking service or platform for short term benefit and more as an educational and innovative service that intends on being a software leader in personal learning and growth.<p>Product<p>Software entrepreneurs like to talk about the ""minimum viable product""; that is, the very minimum that you have to build for your product to be useful (since you can always add enhancements later with software). In very simple terms, the MVP for this product is building of something like a personal / private blog -- categorized (x-axis of the visualization), timestamped (time axis) posts with arbitrary content, plus some fancy visualization. Good news about that; the back end is very easy, interface notwithstanding. Most of the development will be a timeline view of the data. The idea teaches people to have smarter interactions with, summarize, and centralize the multitude of events across their lives. By utilizing a well defined educational program, this piece leverages all the content produced by a user and enhances its utility by linking data points to actual relevant articles. Using the navigation stick advances the graphic at a readable and controlled pace that feels like scrolling. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through articles, photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Importantly, mouseless accessibility is imbedded for mobile applications. Again, herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The user commands the power of the Internet by E Managing information at powerful levels with a system that serves their needs: to learn, remember, and enrich their intellect. IQ Mind Map explores how to simultaneously show different slices through the dataset at any given time. At start up, the page loads with a nice introductory animation that gives a quick overview of the timeline of events and very clearly suggests functionality. Last to load are the navigational elements, suggesting how we should explore the timeline. The suggested dimensionality and well-defined symbols are visually striking and there are smart interaction design elements. The symbols and key are easy to follow and the relationship of the timeline content labels is obvious, especially when hovering over an event and maneuvering through layers of data. With ease the program also enhances access beyond flash and the mouse by listing out the articles and links for each topic timeline on user request.<p>This system is an Internet phenomenon not yet created by any other developer; the program can ultimately be used as a informative road trip every week or month to refresh the brain's memories. IQ Mind Map is not just the story of your life, it is a tool to make you more intelligent. Similar graphics have been shared across the web and praised for its striking visuals and extreme utility. By using the IQ Mind Map program users will finally have the ability to document and recall everything meaningful to them in one powerful program.<p>On the educational and learning side of the process the mobile device and desktop computer supply the brain with unprecedented opportunity to review what was once left to memory to sort out and jot down. Now people are able to use already available technology to elevate the organization and management levels of their lives.  A kind of virtual instructor programed to assist the user. In tandem with the users device the brains neurons and synaptic networks can be strengthened by continuously (over a life time) reviewing, sharing and editing previously forgotten thoughts and ideas. Ultimately making the user smarter, a wonderful bi-product of simple time management.<p>To give a contextual view of this proposal please visit the following interactive:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/68tu9vr  Contextually you will have to imagine that the bottom timeline is the life of a person from his/her first memory to present day. The ""Path or road will be the interactive timeline individuals will use to map their lives. Each icon on the ""road"" will be important facts/experiences the person wants to remember.<p>To develop the IQ Mind Map product database, software, interface, and fund the advertising, marketing, and product sales. The business is in the conceptual stage and requires the funding to develop and launch this exciting and revolutionary product.<p>Basic Criteria<p>Derek Lowe, Proprietorship is based in Victoria, BC. This projects scope is the Internet - related industry and is considered as being in the geographical area of Canada. The project team made up of professionals intend to design and develop the technology, cold call, network, go to trade shows and whatever else is appropriate, generally work to move the the product, deal with all the business paperwork, run day-to-day business operations, and find the investor/s.<p>Key Criteria<p>The key management team is made up of university graduates and entrepreneurs. Two of which have BAs in business management, professional communications, and multidisciplinary studies and one manager with an MBA. The team is a solid group of professionals and Internet developers with relevant business experience. The key principals have vested interest in the success of the venture by way of ownership, profit sharing and equity interest. The vested interest includes the willingness to take on and work with a new equity partner during the growth phase of the business and the principals share the vision of liquidity as the stakeholders of the venture.<p>The venture is a personal/private E Life (learning and management) product for the education / learning niche in the large and growing Internet market. Market research reveals there is a growing need for Internet products that are meaningful and respect the privacy and social networks of its users. The product is an innovative product that services peoples needs to manage their lives appropriately and professionally. Its designed to be competitive and have a sustainable advantage.<p>Investment Guidelines<p>The initial investment sought by the company is $3 million to $5 million preferably in a 3-6 year investment period with a managed fund owning 10-45% minority share position depending on valuation and investment amount. In addition to equity capital the business accepts the managed fund's participation on the Board of Directors providing management expertise, advice and counseling, as well as a useful network of resources. The investment will be invested in the steps to take the concept through the product development stage, then marketing and advertising, and sales of the IQ Mind Map program.  The team is also open to other creative partnership possibilities and approaches.<p>Background and Future of Internet<p>The Global Brain is a metaphor for the worldwide intelligent network formed by people together with the information and communication technologies that connect them into an ""organic"" whole. As the Internet becomes faster, more intelligent, more ubiquitous and more encompassing, it increasingly ties us together in a single information processing system, that functions like a ""brain"" for the planet Earth. The term was coined by Peter Russell in 1982 to describe how the Internet might be developed to achieve this.<p>Research and development shows the trends, and I just want to draw a little bit of a futuristic picture, which is the emergence of the global brain. Consisting of all the humans connected to each other and to the machines they interact with in a very unique and profound way. Creating an intelligence that does not belong to any single human being or computer, but really spread out living its own life and significantly defining the actions of each particular individual, in the not so distant future. One striking fact is that about 20 percent of the global energy 10 years from now will be dedicated solely to maintain this global intelligence, and this number is around 10 percent already today in developed countries. And that actually can comfortably compare to 20 percent of calories that our human brains consume daily to support our traditional intelligence.<p>A good comment that outlines the importance of developing this type of software....<p>The Global Brain already exists in nature  in that the infant brain is delivered out of the box, as it were, un-accessorized. Immediately after, however, (and perhaps even in the womb?) parents, care-givers, peers and a host of other actors begin the natural process of accessorizing the newborn with the provincial characteristics needed to maximize the potential for survival in its present environment: language, culture, beliefs, prejudices, and myriad other social and intellectual delineators and constrictors. Ironically these very accoutrement's, while ensuring inter-cultural harmony, have also been ultimately responsible for the most xenophobically-driven, egregious acts of horror and inhumanity ever recorded throughout history.<p>The Global Brain stands in stark contrast, accessorized to reason expansively vs. provincially. By nature it understands why others behave and believe as they do. Two and one-half millennia ago Aristotle coined the word ecumenism, referring to a world under one roof. Similarly, IQ Mind Map's ultimate vision reaches far, far beyond the disappointments of wealth and power. Those sad eyes betray an innate human longing: a humankind truly and ultimately ecumenical in nature.<p>1 Referenced from Wikipedia.com, Global Brain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain<p>--",1319333761,1452898376

Strategy in place to have the platforms generate instant returns with potential of USD 1 Million in the first year with projected revenue of around USD 1 Billion by year 6. Its not in competiton with twitter, facebook, foursquare etc. Our idea coners the smart phone and internet market but our focus on development is 70% mobile phone and 30% web. I feel we have come up with a strong idea for which there is a mayor market growing daily and have the right marketing plan in place. We have our whole strategy in place from starting up to first and second tier funding all the way to the exit strategy.

Not so much in the sense of strong vs. weak AI, but in the sense of AI as a rich interdisciplinary field rather than a purely technical one, where an important part of the field&#x27;s research is in understanding how to formalize/computationalize vague concepts like &quot;intelligence&quot;. A few AI folks I like in that vein: Marvin Minsky, Robert Abelson, John McCarthy, Allen Newell, Phil Agre, Erik Mueller, Michael Mateas, Ian Horswill, Jaime Carbonell.<p>Some interesting domains: design-support and design-automation systems, generative art, computer music, videogame possibility spaces, procedural architecture. And the history of all that stuff.<p>Biographically speaking, I&#x27;m an American, of recent Greek descent, who lives in Copenhagen.

mkalif,0,2,0.0,0,0,"“When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and you&#x27;re life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That&#x27;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you&#x27;ll never be the same again.” - Steve Jobs",1451974045,1453282995

mobileize,0,1,0.0,1,0,"MOBILEIZE  The Drive to Purchase Platform [Integrated with Facebook, Twitter, NFC etc.] Patent Pending.<p>Mobileize connects advertising to purchase locations. We are an innovative cloud based mobile marketing platform that allows brands and retailers to influence purchase behaviour by connecting any communication (on or off-line) to a physical location using any device with an html5 browser (smartphone, tablet, laptop, PC).<p>Please experience the platform for yourself on your mobile\nhttp://fullers.mobileize.co.uk/?find<p>Please see link to our a short Sales Presentation deck to provide an insight into our product proposition and how we are engaging with major retailers, brands and media owners [e.g. Facebook / Twitter] -<p>http://www.mobileize.co.uk/uploads/5/3/0/0/5300468/mobileize_drive_to_purchase_overview.pdf.<p>Our technology has been running flawlessly for 1 year. We have secured 2 clients since filing our patent on 6th June 2013. [Fullers Pubs  400 locations & National Trust 600 locations]. Our platform works globally and we have significant interest from many of the worlds biggest brands including Facebook, Twitter, Coke, McDonalds, Kraft, Cadbury, Tesco, Chrysler.<p>The market problem<p>Advertising cant show consumers where they can purchase product, thus creating a barrier in the typical sales funnel or path to purchase. Our vision is to complete the path to purchase by directly linking consumers to the nearest place to purchase in advertising or communications, enabling brands and retailers to interact with consumers when they are at their most receptive.\nAlmost all of the growth in the global advertising market in the next four years will come from mobile related spend. Within the mobile category itself, location based services will be both the largest and the fastest growing, creating a Total Addressable Market of approximately 5 billion USD by 2016 (2 billion USD in 2014). Source: ZenithOptimedia / Berg Insight.<p>Our solution<p>Our mobile marketing platform allows any piece of marketing communication to show consumers where they can purchase the advertised product. This is a disruptive approach to advertising, which gives users of the Mobileize platform the following advantages: - we respond to a stated consumer need immediately when engaged within a campaign;\n-  we provide an audience at scale that has expressed an interest to purchase or interact. Scale because it works on any device and within most advertising mediums, including social media, web site, email, press, outdoor and TV (using bar codes, short codes and NFC].<p>Our Mass Publishing System also enables our clients to target marketing offers and content at consumers on a store by store basis. We provide location and media channel analytics that allows our clients to improve their marketing activity over time.<p>Our business model<p>Mobileize derives its revenue from 12 month rolling service contracts with customers. Contracts include a one off set up cost, a monthly charge per location (between 1 and 5) and a campaign management fee based on the number of interactions with a campaign. Average client revenues of 45-85k are expected to increase year-on-year as the platform develops and its usage increases. Contracts have been modelled based on a single install per customer per country.<p>Competitors<p>We have identified two key areas that create an unfair advantage over location-based competitors such as Google Places, Foursquare and NearMe. Firstly the Mobileize platform runs in the Cloud so it works on any mobile device and can connect to any communication. We are not restricted to just connecting to advertising that is delivered digitally or on mobile devices. Mobileize works equally well in outdoor or in press advertising and even works on moving buses or trains and on underground transport where Internet is available. Secondly, we have a fast mass publishing system, where individual store information and content can be changed on an hourly basis across thousands of stores.<p>The Management Team<p>Gray Sycamore, CTO  & Co-Founder  was formerly Leo Burnett Group Digital Director and developed the Mobileize technical platform over the last 2 years. Chris Nicholls, CSO & Co-Founder  was formerly Worldwide Managing Director International clients at TBWA /TEQUILA Worldwide in New York. Paul Kingsley, CFO  has held a number of senior positions within digital businesses including CEO of Oyster Partners (now LBi/Digitas) and has significant experience working with start-up organisations. Members of Advisory Board - Matt Atkinson Chief Marketing Officer Tesco PLC & Jason Kuperman Vice President - Digital, Asia Pacific, India, Middle East and Africa at Omnicom Group.<p>What we are looking for<p>Mobileize is a UK registered company (GSCN Limited t/a as Mobileize) and is seeking to secure $1.6M in order to develop the business over the next 12 months in the following specific areas: General working capital; Developing our technology roadmap; We will also develop new business opportunities in international markets initially in North America from Q2 2014.\nThe Management team are looking to achieve revenues in excess of USD 50million by Year 5, equivalent to 1% of the global addressable market.",1381405695,1452917149

Our servers also run and are compatible with most virtualization solutions such as vmware, Xen, Kvm, and Microsoft.<p>Besides flexibility, our server storage technology allows startups and enterprise to eliminate some of the annual burden costs of physical hardware such as purchase price, administrator time, SLAs, maintenance, rack space, floor space, power, cooling, etc. which altogether creates a huge impact to company operations. We optimize underutilized storage inefficiencies through flexible capacity management tools. A few things Moolave highly considers with this\ninfrastructure is security, administration, and stability while running efficiently at the same time.  Our website is www.moolave.com<p>Moolave's cost-efficient server storage does not require daily sync schedules which is a prevalent maintenance challenge among companies that rely on overnight server updates and frequent server maintenance that require downtime.  Our remote virtual storage servers replicate\ndata in realtime at an event of local server downtime and server update.  If one server shuts down due to network failure, another remote server instantly mirrors and preserves the same exact data without losing the most updated information.",1273984245,1452889278

I know, I know.<p>For 7 years, I spent 9 months of each year in remote Pacific South America, doing volunteer work - and surfing, quite a lot during the good season! Each year I&#x27;d return and do about 3 months of contract programming on-site with great teams.<p>Like pg says, lots of good projects, to really do them right, have to be companies. For that reason I can&#x27;t rule out doing a startup some day.

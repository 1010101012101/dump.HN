Further access by 3Taps after that rescission was “without authorization.”<p>> The banned user has to follow only one, clear rule: do not access the website.<p>The IP ban was considered evidence that the requirement to stay off the website was properly communicated, but the C&D is surely sufficient for that purpose.<p>(Orin Kerr actually blasts the judge for misunderstanding the law, saying that in his [Kerr&#x27;s] view accessing the website after receiving a C&D would not in itself be an offense... but the judgment is officially the law, and Orin Kerr isn&#x27;t.)",1408336209

There is research backing up diet-based interventions that positively impacts or cures all of these, but instead, patients are given pills that are barely palliative.<p>That diet plays this role is not, of course, a surprise to anybody. The failing that I see is that every medical body has chosen to follow the &quot;everything in moderation&quot; line[1] instead of addressing the health needs of millions of people. The diet being promoted by these organizations is <i>causing</i> these problems.<p>Imagine a world where the AHA, the ADA, the AND, the AMA, the IoM, and every other health organization came out strongly in favor of a science-based diet[2].  When you went to your family practice physician, your endocrinologist, your dietitian, or whomever, you would hear that diet is the very best treatment, and you would hear specifics on what foods you should avoid, what you can safely partake in, and what might or might not work for you, depending on you[3].<p>I&#x27;m not naive enough to think this would solve all of our problems, but the amount of crap food being eaten under the guise of &quot;everything is OK in moderation&quot; is, literally, killing people. You go into a dietitian&#x27;s office, and they are advertising sugar-filled crap whose only nutritional benefit has been added during the processing. You go into a doctor&#x27;s office and food is never mentioned, but you see 85 advertisements for the various drugs that will &quot;manage your condition&quot;.

Unfortunately, a lifetime of bad inputs cannot be fixed that way.<p>0. Unfortunately, truly proving causation is very difficult here, and it is possible that there may be other causes but the lack of proper nourishment is preventing the body from healing the damage caused elsewhere.

It&#x27;s hard to believe that it&#x27;s not because of the millions of dollars in contributions given by companies whose food is making people sick or by the companies who provide drugs that provide said barely palliative care.

8191376,comment,8191194,8191194,13,0,wallflower,,,"Old but still relevant article from 1999 about Cisco&#x27;s king of acquisitions, Mike Volpi (70 companies in 5 years)<p>><p>Volpi is arguably Silicon Valley&#x27;s shrewdest shopper. He needs to be. With a dearth of engineering talent and shrinking product cycles, Cisco realized that it couldn&#x27;t build everything it needed inside the company. Says Don Listwin, Cisco&#x27;s No. 2 executive: &quot;Lucent wants the smartest group of people in Bell Labs. But if we&#x27;re not good at something, we&#x27;ve got Silicon Valley. It&#x27;s our lab.&quot;<p>The company looks to startups if it decides it&#x27;s too far behind competitors to take the time to build a product from scratch. Once that decision is made, Volpi&#x27;s team consults with business units and customers to find out about their technological needs. Customers have a profound influence on Cisco&#x27;s strategy. Its executives say that US West, the Denver Baby Bell, was a driving factor behind the decision in March 1998 to acquire NetSpeed, a maker of equipment that turns regular phone lines into high-speed digital subscriber line (DSL) data conduits.<p>With a few targets in mind, Volpi and his team perform an evaluation that&#x27;s unique in scope. As engineers examine the technology and financiers go over the company&#x27;s books, Cisco&#x27;s team also examines the depth of the company&#x27;s talent, the quality of its management, and its venture funding--all things aimed at making the integration process easier should Cisco buy. Since Cisco will acquire a company as often for its talent as for its technology, it needs to focus on these &quot;softer&quot; issues early.<p>There&#x27;s one more test. Volpi&#x27;s got a knack for identifying a startup at the sweet spot of its development: when it is old enough to have a finished and tested product, yet young enough to be privately held and flexible in its ways. Acquire a business that&#x27;s too mature, and risk soars. Explains Volpi: &quot;If you buy a company with customers, product flows, and entrenched enterprise resource systems, you have to move very gingerly. Otherwise, you risk customer dissatisfaction. Figuring out how to integrate this type of company could take nine months.&quot;<p>After all this evaluation, Cisco doesn&#x27;t necessarily leap to purchase. Instead it may pass on a company or may act as a venture firm, making a 10% equity investment to monitor the startup&#x27;s growth. That&#x27;s what it did with Monterey last winter. A few months later, after deciding that the Richardson, Texas, startup would give it entree into the $20-billion-a-year optical-internetworking market, it gobbled up the rest. Says Joe Bass, CEO of Monterey: &quot;We had interest from other companies, but they didn&#x27;t move as fast as Cisco. They were still considering us when the announcement came out that Cisco had bought us.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;It&#x27;s easier to integrate engineers who are rich and happy than ones looking for a way out,&quot; says Paul Sagawa, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t believe mergers of equals work.&quot; --JOHN CHAMBERS<p>Turn the conversation to Cisco, and Chambers is equally frank in discussing its acquisition methods. As with any heavily used process, he says, there are bound to be mistakes. For Cisco, they&#x27;ve arisen when the company has deviated from its strategy by forcing a company into Cisco&#x27;s infrastructure.<p>(&quot;It was my naivete when we acquired software companies and moved them from their own distribution systems into ours. Dumb. Dumb.&quot;)<p>Or when Cisco has mistimed its bid. Valley pundits say the 1996 acquisition of Granite Systems, a maker of so-called gigabit ethernet switches, didn&#x27;t work because Granite&#x27;s product wasn&#x27;t as far along as Cisco had believed.<p>On the other hand, people close to one of Cisco&#x27;s largest acquisitions, that of StrataCom in 1996, say it was difficult because StrataCom was too large and its product too developed. Cisco had trouble integrating elements of its operating system into StrataCom&#x27;s switches.<p>This particular problem doesn&#x27;t bode well, say some analysts.<p>As telecom equipment giants Nortel (revenues: $17.6 billion) and Lucent (revenues: $38 billion) take aim at Cisco&#x27;s markets, they say, Cisco will need another large acquisition. Chambers, however, is forging ahead with smaller ones, telling attendees at October&#x27;s Telecom 99 conference in Geneva that he&#x27;ll make up to 25 this year.<p>&quot;In a merger you can&#x27;t blend resources and cultures--only one can survive,&quot; he says. So Chambers and his team are busy scouring the world to make sure the survivor is Cisco.<p><a href=""http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/08/268506/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive...</a>",1408334434

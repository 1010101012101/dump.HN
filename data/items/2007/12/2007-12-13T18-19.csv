89244,comment,89163,89204,0,0,shankys,,,"Scala has some very nice features for making Java's libraries much nicer to deal with. The most useful are probably implicit definitions and parameters, operators (any method may be used as an infix or postfix operator), and target typing. You can often ""Scalify"" a library using these features. See [1] and [2] to see what I mean. These features are also great for creating DSLs.<p>The recent Scala 2.6 compiler brought some other niceties like structural types (imagine duck typing with a static type system), existential types, and lazy values.<p>All in all, I've been thoroughly impressed with Scala.<p>[1] Pimp my Library: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=179766"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=179766</a><p>[2] Simplifying JDBC: <a href=""http://scala.sygneca.com/code/simplifying-jdbc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scala.sygneca.com/code/simplifying-jdbc</a>",1197571683

Now draw a line through all of them that came to market as the first mover.  I'll bet you don't draw a single line.<p>As long as businesses want more money and want to save more time, there is always room for b2b products that can demonstrate good ROI.<p>On the consumer side, there's certainly plenty of room.  I just read that Meebo is reaching 30 million people per month.  Twitter is functionally brand new and kicking ass.<p>The good news is that most consumer sites transition from a ""providing value"" stance (in the early days) to an ""extracting value"" stance (in the later days).  Later stage consumer sites add more advertising, do more biz dev deals, and overall muddy up their value prop. Meanwhile, the next round of consumer startups leap into the fray with a nimble team, the next rev of web technologies, and a desire to provide value and build something that's better than the big guys.  Compuserve, Prodigy, AOL, Friendster, MySpace, Facebook...  They are/were all on the same road.",1197571486

He wants that Google juice, but when the comments now reside on the disqus.com domain, it's harder to connect the two.<p>The second one is a biggie. For the power users, they won't like this at all. The blogspot/wordpress.com folks wouldn't care, but the ones that make it their business to blog professionally would.",1197571322

Who can say.<p>The tourists still find the Buddha Bar a ""must hit"" spot in Paris.  Even though the ""globally hip"" crowd hangs out more in La Republique, Le Marais, or even Monmartre now.  Eschewing what they perceive to be the pretentiousness of the Champs Elysee.<p>He is right when he says that these things fall in and out of fashion cyclically.  During the Jazz age Harlem was hot, falling out of favor in the 70s and 80s, only to enjoy an admittedly controversial renaissance in the 90s to the present.  Musical instruments may have had a brisk trade in Harlem during the Jazz age, but now something a little more bland is in order if you want to make money.  Think Pottery Barn. (I know . . . it saddens the heart)<p>It is wise to try to strike while the iron is hot rather than build a business that is dependent on its heat.",1197570936

Putting words in your mouths:<p>You: if people don't know how to make something cheaply enough it's not a market.<p>Ivan: it <i>could</i> be a market if you solve the technological problem of making it cheaper.<p>You: making food cheaper isn't a market because the poor have no money.<p>Ivan: making food cheaper isn't a <i>feasible</i> market because nobody knows how to make it happen.<p>There, now you can return to the interesting question, continue arguing about what fraction of the needs you can think up are technologically feasible :)",1197570783

Shows come and go every year, so there will always be a need for new ones.<p>In an attention economy you're fighting for eyeballs. And there's a smaller group that's always looking for what's new and different. If you want to pursue this demographic, and the larger, lagging crowd behind them, then you have a chance at capturing attention.<p>I share many of your concerns, and personally use very few Web applications--basically maps and mail. I often ask the same question: what can I build?<p>Perhaps it's better to choose a pre-existing category/market and try to win through better execution. I also think success is more likely when building software as a product instead of a free service.",1197569617

184084,comment,183535,183831,0,0,jamongkad,,,"Agreed 12 months for a demoable web app is bad IMHO, unless you're writing avionics software(even that is a stretch) web apps aren't exactly rocket science to begin with. So you can chalk it up to developer inexperience OR she was doing work on the side. Which would probably explain why it took her 12 months to begin with.",1210211623

I don't have any personal experience but a quick google search will back me up when I assert they are notorious for not being trustworthy with your whois queries. A site like this that I felt like I could trust would be a daily destination for me.",1210211387

184076,comment,183964,183964,0,0,edw519,,,"Thanks, cowmoo, for your story.  It could have been mine.<p>I too went to an ""artsy liberal arts college"".  I majored in English for about 3 weeks.  Then it was math forever.  I was also fortunate enough to join a social fraternity and had the time of my life (not just the parties, but all of it including managing a small ""business"").<p>Upon graduation, I had 2 choices: continue on to pursue my PhD in math or get my MBA and go into IT.  As much as I loved math, it was an easy choice because I had already discovered the answer to your question by then.  It's both, but mainly the people.  A career in IT has given me ample doses of both and I've never looked back.  I was always afraid that if I had continued in math I may have become a recluse again.<p>I love hacking into the wee hours of the night.  It's so cool making something out of nothing that only another hacker soul could understand.  Sounds like you do.<p>But just as much, I enjoy sharing my code and seeing people use it.  Sometimes when I write something particularly cool, I find myself thinking something like, ""I bet Jane will love this!""<p>Here's another question in response to your original question:<p>If your write the coolest app in the forest and no one ever uses it, does it make a sound?",1210210811
184075,comment,183964,183964,0,0,monological,,,"One word....balance.<p>I struggle with the exact same thing, day in and day out. I have an 8 hour job, which after I'm done with, go and work like a mad man on my startup, coding away, brainstorming. I don't call people if I don't have to because, deep down I have this almost insatiable itch to start a company and be my own boss, work my own hours, be excited about what I do everyday, have more open doors... The list is almost endless and the fact that I could one day have all those things drives me to work even harder.<p>Alas, attention always needs to be given to family, friends and YOURSELF. Otherwise you'll break down. You'll go crazy. You'll screw-up your relationships and damage your health. Simply put, in the end, you are just gonna be plain unhappy.",1210210592

184060,comment,183513,184027,0,0,wheels,,,"I disagree.  If you're going to mixers for startups, which for us is how we're hoping to stir up customers, it's good to be able to give them something to hang onto.  It's a lot less clumsy than having to reach for a pen and paper.  Why do I say this?  Because I tried pen and paper at the last one that I went to.  Yesterday I ordered business cards.<p>That said, I don't think it's important that they're impressive early on.  If we're going to impress people it's going to be with what we say, not with our cards.  The card has one function:  so that they still have our contact info when they get back to their office.  I got the cheapest ones I could find (50 for €12) and spent all of about half an hour sorting that out.",1210208897

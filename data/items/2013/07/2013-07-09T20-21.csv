It also seems to overlap with Soulver, which is my go-to calculator on iOS.<p>Cleverly, Calca appears to go a bit further than even MMA by back-filling changed definitions, almost like functional reactive programming.

6015453,comment,6012400,6015030,1,0,davidcuddeback,,,"> <i>No, you don&#x27;t have to prove a negative.</i><p>That&#x27;s equivalent to saying that a scientific claim doesn&#x27;t have to be falsifiable. That&#x27;s not true. A claim has to be falsifiable for a reason.<p>> <i>If it has not been proven, then it does not exist.</i><p>So the Higgs Boson didn&#x27;t exist six months ago? It wasn&#x27;t proven, because there wasn&#x27;t enough evidence for a statistically relevant result until March 2013. So does that mean that prior to March, you would have concluded that the Higgs Boson doesn&#x27;t exist?<p>If I had to sum up my problem with your reasoning in one sentence, it would be &quot;belief is scalar, not boolean.&quot; Evidence should adjust your belief state somewhere between 0 and 1, but it should almost never be exactly 0 or 1.<p>> <i>Just as until unicorns are proven to exist, it is correct to state that unicorns do not exist.</i><p>That&#x27;s a variant of the &quot;existence of god&quot; problem. It&#x27;s a non-falsifiable hypothesis. That doesn&#x27;t fall within the realm of science, because it&#x27;s not subject to empirical evidence.<p>> <i>My opinion is based on the evidence.</i><p>I still haven&#x27;t seen the evidence to support your conclusion.<p>TDD&#x27;s claimed benefits are falsifiable. Much like the Higgs Boson prior to March 2013, they have been neither proven nor falsified. But that doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t form a tentative belief based on the weight of the current evidence available.<p>The weight of the evidence I&#x27;ve seen leans toward indicating some real benefits beyond normal unit testing. It&#x27;s inconclusive because the studies lack statistical power and procedural consistency, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should automatically jump to a hardline decision in either direction (positive or negative). (Again, belief isn&#x27;t boolean.)",1373403568

Carry a lot?<p>I carry on my hip at between 4-5 o&#x27;clock, and it is not a small or light gun (4&quot; aluminum frame M1911 + spare magazine on other side), so I don&#x27;t exactly forget that I&#x27;m carrying it, but on the other hand the fact that I&#x27;m carrying doesn&#x27;t register strongly---mostly, it&#x27;s about keeping my pants on ^_^.  I notice that the TSA&#x27;s Instagram page shows small guns (smaller than mine) with one possible exception, and states all but the derringers were found in carry on bags.<p>Carrying is something you get accustomed to, and a lot of people get complacent.  Massad Ayoob in his safety video talks about it becoming like &quot;Fluffy&quot;, your pet dog or whatever.<p>With 43 states as of today (Illinois) having <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> shall issue regimes (plus much upstate New York, rural California and Massachusetts (!), and Rhode Island is confused), well more than 2/3rds of the population can legally carry concealed.  As of last summer Clayton Cramer and the GAO  independently estimated 7.5 and 8 million people have concealed carry licenses.  That number is skyrocketing based on all reports, Vermont, Alaska, Arizona, Wyoming and as of this month Arkansas don&#x27;t even require a license, and Illinois will be adding upwards of 10 million citizens eligible.<p>Yow, now 8 out of the top 10 states by population, all but California (1) and New York (3), all but 5 out of the top 20.<p>So, yeah, that many people, I can believe that much forgetfulness.

I think more than any other platform, how your application is going to be used, and who it&#x27;s going to be used by are vital points of information that you need to answer before you approach the issue:<p>1) Are your visual flourishes vital to the quality of your product?<p>2) How concerned are you with baseline performance?<p>3) How big is your application? Do you need disparate components to be reusable, or do you need a philosophy or underlying framework to guide development?<p>4) Is your application going to be used on mobile?<p>The answer to 1 dictates how you should approach things like animating elements. Much of the time, the animation is really just a visual flourish, and can be handled with graceful degredation through CSS. Plus you can learn a few tricks using just CSS that don&#x27;t trigger unnecessary redraws that might happen using JS.<p>The answer to 2 dictates whether or not you should adopt an existing framework or library vs. rolling your own. Libraries have gotten better about making themselves available piecemeal, but if you know how to write quick code, you&#x27;ll often find almost everything is not quite what you absolutely need. See Canvas game dev.<p>Question 3 will determine what sort of framework you&#x27;ll want. Something that is extendable and object-oriented, vs. something that has more self-contained reusable components. The drawback of the former is that classing in JS brings in a considerable performance hit, whereas reusable components make for much more unmaintainable code.<p>Question 4 will play a roll in all the aforementioned questions, namely where matters of performance and DOM redraws are concerned, as that&#x27;s where mobile tends to fall flat when it comes to web apps.",1373402426

You would find a lot of software written in languages like Python or Java, even though using C or assembly would probably produce better performance. But using C or assembly that software would probably never be produced because its complexity would be harder to manage.<p>Of course, performance does matter - even writing in Python, you have to worry about performance. But here we effectively see an argument saying &quot;since we have a lot of software in Python, if we switch it to C we&#x27;ll have massive performance gains&quot;.

So basically after a procedure or hospital stay, the care givers make up a basic list of the things they did and the drugs given, etc, and it&#x27;s passed on to a billing department, who maps to a set of codes that might differ depending on who&#x27;s paying (gov&#x27;t vs insurer 1 vs insurer 2). This is by definition lossy.<p>It&#x27;s an oversimplification, but one hospital might say &quot;Well we&#x27;ve got a superstar brain surgeon here whose time is 3x as expensive as normal, but can only bill for &#x27;BRAIN SURGEON - 1 HOUR&#x27;, so we&#x27;ll crank the prices up on the scalpel and the tylenol to compensate&quot;, where another picks totally different things to compensate the prices on because they have a different cost structure.<p>Big insurers expect to be negotiated with separately for competitive advantage reasons, and sometimes use different billing codes anyway, so even if you had the closely guarded master price list of the hospital, it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily do you any good.<p>For the uninsured, the occasional price-insensitive person rolls in (aka the &quot;Saudi Prince wants his own wing for cancer treatment&quot; situation), so they jack the uninsured prices WAY up only expecting a few percent back from 98% of patients. This further breaks the pricing data, and causes major problems for less-saavy people who are used to seeing a bill and being expected to pay it, as opposed to negotiate.<p>Bottom line: It&#x27;s complicated, and politically fraught.

For example, old people (who are big customers) are often best if they are told to just go home, and look after themselves. Cutting up old people can be a waste of time (since they are unlikely to live a lot longer), and can actually reduce their life expectancy (since they don&#x27;t always survive surgery).<p>Also, the money the US spends on healthcare could be better spent educating the people who will otherwise drop out of high school, which drastically reduces their life expectancy (since they can&#x27;t read so good, have trouble getting jobs which don&#x27;t involve selling meth, and otherwise have terrible lives).",1373401490

Why are pedestrians banned from walking on roads, even when there are no nearby sidewalks? The answer, I believe, is that it&#x27;s extremely dangerous, both to the pedestrian and to automobile drivers, and that it would cause massive inefficiency in the flow of traffic. The reality is that bicycles, like pedestrians, necessarily behave <i>very</i> different than automobiles, and most of our roads and traffic laws are designed around automobiles. Similarly, bicycles are not allowed on certain types of roads (many bridges, freeways, etc.) Obviously, its a continuum, and bicycles can fit in with automobiles better than pedestrians. The question is simply where to draw the line.",1373400973

6015119,comment,6014422,6014711,2,0,Charos,,,"This is something I&#x27;ve been thinking about recently. If you boil down the &#x27;news problem,&#x27; the dominant solutions are traditional news channels (TV networks, newspapers) and sites like Reddit and Digg. I would categorize bloggers as very small-scale traditional news sources, and RSS feeds as a way to combine these traditional and nontraditional sources.<p>The strength of traditional news is partly cultural, but also due to the nature of its content as being curated and vetted by some (hopefully) informed party prior to publication. Whatever is there, can very generally be expected to be of a higher quality than any random given &#x27;social news&#x27; post on the same subject. The drawback, of course, is that the only news available is that which the source determines is &#x27;newsworthy,&#x27; which is a very subjective and questionable standard.<p>Conversely, the strength of &#x27;social news&#x27; sources such as Reddit is in their inherent chaos. The crowd decides what floats to the top, with no real vetting process or curation except within the most strictly moderated subcommunities. This ensures that the most socially relevant topics get &#x27;published&#x27; to the front page and into the public eye, but those stories have little to no quality control. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept of the &quot;Eternal September,&quot; there has been an established trend wherein as the size of a loosely controlled network grows, the quality and content increasingly caters to the lowest common denominator, driving the more invested (and usually the more intellectual) users out, and eroding the value of the network. This has been seen over and over on Reddit, as the mainstream subreddits get overrun with a colossal stream of new users, and any niche interests get sidelined and marginalized.<p>I would propose a hybrid approach. Why not create a news source - whatever category you decide to label it - that publishes content that is vetted for quality (bias, sensationalism, thoroughness, etc.) but not subject area; in other words, where the articles are all good, and any subject is fair game? Layered on this could be some categorized and &#x27;social&#x27; voting algorithm, much like Reddit with subreddits, and users could subscribe to those channels which they cared most strongly for, thereby creating their own high quality news source.<p>This is just a thought I had today. It&#x27;s obviously not fully baked yet. What do you think?",1373400961

In many bugs or crashes the root of the problem is some offset in a binary file or some incorrect custom binary file format node that breaks everything after it.

There may be good technical answers to his objections; Thomas replied to them above quite cogently, but in any event, PHK&#x27;s opinion carries a lot more weight than mine. I&#x27;m just a spectator.<p>My objection (observation, really) is that one expects protocol 2.0 to do more than address performance optimization. Simplifying the protocol is a good thing to do with a major revision; they didn&#x27;t do that. Making the protocol more friendly for upper layer users is another good thing to do with a major revision; they didn&#x27;t do that either. Instead they took an obviously different protocol designed to address a handful of extremely technical performance matters and rubber-stamped it as HTTP 2.0. Whether you like SPDY or not, it should be clear that this kind of &quot;process&quot; is going to leave people feeling disenfranchised. The spirit of HTTP, inasmuch as such a thing exists, is one of simplicity. SPDY just doesn&#x27;t &quot;smell&quot; like the successor.<p>I think the comparison to R6RS is very appropriate to my point. R6RS was designed to address well-known shortcomings of Scheme. The process it took to get approved circumvented a lot of the community. A large segment of the community responded to this by essentially whining about it and ignoring it. We already see the whining about HTTP 2.0. I predict it will be followed by ignoring it, and some years in the future, an HTTP 2.1 or 3.0 that more closely resembles HTTP 1.1.",1373400579

6015060,comment,6013784,6013784,38,0,kannanvijayan,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a JS JIT developer.<p>The use of Sunspider performance to talk about JS application performance is unfortunate, and undermines a significant part of the argument made in the article.  Sunspider is a great benchmark to use to talk about web _page_ performance.<p>This is how JITs work:
1. Javascript code starts executing in a slow environment.
2. In this execution mode, a lot of overhead is spent collecting type information so that the hot code can be optimized.
3. After some period of time, the hot code is compiled with an optimizing compiler, which is a very expensive task.
4. The compiled code starts running.<p>For example, in Mozilla&#x27;s JS engine, these are the actual numbers associated with optimization:
1. A function starts off running in the interpreter
2. After it gets called 10 times (or a loop within it goes around 10 times), it gets compiled with the Baseline JIT, which performs heavyweight bytecode analysis on the javascript code, generates unoptimized machine code which is instrumented to acquire information about the executing JS.
3. After 1000 iterations (most of that running within Baseline jitcode), the function gets compiled with our optimizing compiler, IonMonkey.<p>How does this relate to Sunspider?<p>Well, if you actually run Sunspider, you&#x27;ll notice that the entire benchmark takes about 0.2 seconds or less on a modern machine (about 1.5 seconds on a modern phone).  It&#x27;s an extremely tiny benchmark (in terms of computation heaviness).  Comparatively, the Octane suite, while containing fewer benchmarks, actually takes 100 times or so longer to execute than sunspider.<p>How many apps do you use that run for less than 1.5 seconds?<p>This is the problem with using Sunspider to talk about app performance.  Sunspider doesn&#x27;t measure JIT performance very well at all.  When JIT engines execute Sunspider, they spend a relatively large amount of that time just collecting the necessary information before they can start optimizing.  Then, soon after we spend all that effort optimizing the code, the benchmark ends, without really taking advantage of all that fast code.<p>Very often, JIT optimizations that speed up computationally heavy benchmarks actually regress Sunspider.  This is because the optimizations add some extra weight to the initial analysis that happens before optimized code is generated.  This hurts sunspider because the initial analysis section is much more heavily weighted than later optimized performance.<p>Sunspider&#x27;s runtime characteristics make it a good benchmark for measuring web PAGE performance.  Web pages are much more likely to contain code that executes for short periods of time (a few ms), and then stops.  But apps have much different runtime characteristics.  Apps don&#x27;t execute code for a few milliseconds and then stop.  They run for dozens of seconds, minimally, and often minutes at a time.  A JIT engine has much more opportunity to generate good optimized code, and have that optimized code taken advantage of over more of the execution time.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that such a fundamental misunderstanding of the characteristics and nature of optimized javascript is used to drive an argument about it.",1373400518

You&#x27;d have to build a large database of all aircraft approach speeds, taking into account all the various factors (different weights and configurations) that could change. You&#x27;d also have to take into account wind speed and direction, since radar will measure ground speed, but airspeed is what matters. And not just wind, but wind <i>at their precise altitude</i>, which your ground weather station is not measuring. (Wind speed and direction can vary enormously over altitude, especially close to the ground, due to friction.) Finally, you&#x27;d have to catch it and communicate it in time to do something useful, which seems tough in this case, since the airspeed didn&#x27;t get low until fairly shortly before the crash.<p>I wonder if a simple and effective thing to do here would be to simply display a velocity vector, either in a HUD on the windscreen itself, or on some kind of video display in the cockpit. Just a symbol on the screen that shows exactly which way the airplane is headed at any given moment. When it&#x27;s on a runway, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll touch down if nothing changes. When it&#x27;s on a seawall before the runway, that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re going to crash unless you fix things. Maybe I&#x27;m underestimating the difficulty, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be too hard to construct one based on GPS and a forward-looking camera.<p>Edit: thinking more about that last suggestion, more recurrent training for visual approaches would probably be a better idea.

In the case of most city accidents, police routinely pull video from nearby buildings to establish fault.<p>This is completely untrue, at least in NYC.<p>&quot;Historically, nearly half of motorists who kill a New York City pedestrian or cyclist do not receive so much as a citation for careless driving.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/08/03/nypd-7371-pedestrians-and-cyclists-injured-79-killed-through-june-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streetsblog.org/2012/08/03/nypd-7371-pedestrians-...</a>",1373400184

6015015,comment,6013989,6014262,2,0,smsm42,,,"When I&#x27;ve been in Munich, I&#x27;ve seen they have there dedicated lanes for bike traffic, which are not a part of general street and designed so that cars never go there - they are part of the same space as pedestrian walks but pedestrians are not supposed to walk there either - it is an exclusive bike space, with higher barriers for bigger danger (cars) and separation from lower danger (pedestrians). I think it works much better than what is here in California, where bicyclists share space on the road with cars. Each time I drive by a cyclist on the road, I can&#x27;t help thinking how small mistake it would take - either from his/her side or from driver&#x27;s side - for a tragedy to happen. That&#x27;s why I am very reluctant to go on such shared spaces when I&#x27;m biking - I&#x27;d much prefer to have a space of a sidewalk than on a road.",1373400161

I have seen dozens of bicyclists cause absolute chaos in traffic. Granted, I&#x27;ve never seen any collisions, but I can&#x27;t imagine that the chaos I&#x27;ve seen is &quot;safe&quot; compared to the normal flow of traffic.<p>> Yet all it takes is a nudge, honk, door opening, unsignaled turn, etc. to kill a cyclist.<p>True, but if your implication is that bicyclists should be able to freely use roads because of how vulnerable they are, then pedestrians should also be able to freely use roads.",1373400109

6700170,comment,6699146,6699146,2,0,notacoward,,,"When it comes to employee ratings, absolute vs. relative is a red herring.  Both lead to adverse outcomes.  With the more common absolute ratings, managers have an incentive to rate everyone highly, so people who work for honest managers get screwed.  With relative ratings, the weakest members of the strongest teams get screwed.  Rating employees just doesn&#x27;t work unless the departments are also rated.  If you know the relative strength of each department then you can adjust the ratings of its members accordingly.  There&#x27;s still a serious question of what you do with that information, but at least then it won&#x27;t be totally distorted by the differences between teams and managers.",1383958775

Once past Thunder Bay, the train suddenly empties out a bit, so it doesn&#x27;t feel crowded, and spending all day reading, in comfortable seats, with wilderness streaming by the huge window next to you is just wonderful.  I found the other passengers quite interestingI shared my four-seat &quot;section&quot; with a forestry student off to work in a lumbercamp for the summer, and learned a lot of interesting stuff about Canada, and forests... :]and the vibe was very amiable and quiet. People were friendly, but there was a distinct lack of &quot;chatterers&quot; and most people seemed content to do their own thing most of the time.<p>Because the trip took five days, and there was basically <i>no</i> demand on my time, it felt incredibly unrushed, and combined with constant low-level &quot;passive&quot; distraction in the form of scenery, the wonderful light, and the soothing motion and sounds of rail travel, it left me feeling both incredibly relaxed and oddly energetic.<p>Extreme long-distance train travel is generally way underrated, I think; obviously it&#x27;s not ideal if you&#x27;re in a hurry, but if you have a few days, it&#x27;s often a treat.  Although the Canadian trip was the best, I&#x27;ve also traveled by train from Seattle to Boston, and it was a great trip too, for many of the same reasons (Amtrak long-distance seats are just amazingly huge and comfortable though).",1383958724

They approach Google AND they plug into private lines. The latter case is what I referred to when I mentioned &quot;backbone&quot; providers. Again, I want any private entity to have legal standing to refuse NSA requests.<p>><i>The NSA is a rogue agency that does not respect laws (or reinterprets them as they see fit)</i><p>I agree that if an agency goes rogue, then laws are only retroactive. That is, laws provide a penalty that is triggered only after an offense has occurred. But, <i>clear</i> (i.e. not ambiguous) laws with clear penalties can be a powerful deterrent. Whistle-blowers like Snowden are then empowered to stop abuses and illegal activity. They are automatically branded as heroes instead of traitors who must flee the country or worry for their safety. As it is, the good guys like Snowden are being put on the wrong side of the law and vice-versa. This must change.<p>><i>However, the reality is that a rogue agency can evolve in the dark corners of the government, and that therefore it is likely that it will happen again.</i><p>That&#x27;s true and always has been.

I don&#x27;t advocate that we not implement technical measures. Where we depart is on priority. The wording of your last sentence signals this departure.

Even if you did, would you be able to guarantee zero vulnerabilities in your own code?<p>Checking rogue agencies, providing more oversight and enforcing clear laws are the only way out.

And, that javascript canvas demo is relevant to my interest - thanks for the link!<p>You&#x27;re right in your suspicion that depth map generation in Sprite Lamp is not a silver bullet for stuff like that. Images with big discontinuities in depth (especially open scenes, like the one you linked) will likely get you some pretty dubious results in Sprite Lamp. On the other hand, if you look closely at the self-shadowing on the brick gif from the website, I think you&#x27;ll agree that the results are pretty accurate (note that the little notches and scrapes in the surface of some bricks get picked up accurately too) - while you could paint that map by hand, I suspect that getting the results that nice would take some time, and Sprite Lamp does it in a second or two (pre-optimisation). Stuff like character artwork (like the zombie or the plague doctor) fall somewhere in between - you get results that are good enough for self-shadowing, and with some tweaking you can generate a nice stereogram, but it&#x27;s not necessarily &#x27;physically accurate&#x27; (which in this case is another way of saying &quot;I can&#x27;t guarantee the results are what the artist pictured&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m reluctant to promise features that I haven&#x27;t tried yet, but I&#x27;m planning on some experimentation with a combination of painting depth values and using Sprite Lamp - this will take the form of some tools for messing with the depth map from within Sprite Lamp after it&#x27;s been generated, with an eye to intelligently detecting potential edges and letting you move whole bits of the scene around at once (and then an integrated means of actually looking at the depth map you&#x27;ve created - wigglegifs might be a good option there, actually).",1383957841

Well, for starters, you could use a nickname for your first name. Remember this is to just get you through the door. Secondly, if you did go to school here before University, you could list your high school. Basically, anything you could put that would let someone know that your verbal and written English is great would be good.<p>I am not saying that this is what is stopping you from getting an interview, but there are many employers who have become very jaded by having someone come in for an interview who was the perfect candidate on paper but couldn&#x27;t sling a complete sentence together due to language issues.

I&#x27;m not clear on how you inferred such an endorsement from statements that people are going to resist by technical means.</i><p>By &quot;OK&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean that you agree with it. I mean that by assuming the posture that you are going to focus on defending yourself technically, you are effectively ceding that the government has the right to access whatever it can. You&#x27;re telling the government that it&#x27;s OK to get whatever you are unable to protect. It is absolutely the wrong posture and it&#x27;s what the NSA wants.<p>><i>Who is &quot;we&quot; in your proposal? The people of the society?</i><p>Yes. Exactly. Who else would &quot;we&quot; be? What does it matter that some don&#x27;t get it yet when there is some group that finds it objectionable and contrary to our fundamental rights? I mean, it&#x27;s really a strange position to take when you think of it. If the government was coming after you with tanks and guns, would you go buy a shotgun and stronger locks for your doors? Or would you spread the word and work to check the government per the laws of the land?<p>So, how about a grassroots campaign to change the public perception landscape?<p>><i>Maybe you imagine there is some approximation of democracy in the US.</i><p>An approximation of democracy is exactly what I think we have. Listen, you&#x27;re preaching to the choir on the whole &quot;our democracy is broken&quot; thing. But, to the extent that there&#x27;s anything left or any way back, fixing this democracy is our only hope. Again: grassroots.<p>It boggles my mind that the response is to cede everything--broken democracy, surveillance state, etc.--then just dig in to prepare to defend oneself from his/her government. If you actually believe that you can defend yourself from government lawlessness, then you ought to believe that you can play a role in fixing the government.<p>><i>Some elements in Congress have tried regulating the surveillance apparatus...I&#x27;m not perceiving much prospect of improvement on that front.</i><p>And, how long have we been patching zero-day exploits, fending off viruses, etc.? Why are you so confident that you are capable of defending yourself from a determined government with unlimited resources?<p>><i>The only realistic avenue to improving privacy and digital security is some combination of [technical solutions]&quot;.</i><p>I am not advocating that we don&#x27;t take prudent, precautionary technical measures. Of course we should. I&#x27;m saying that they should be secondary and we must lead with legal measures to have any hope of reclaiming our rights and putting an end to this. All of the things you listed sound great. But, in truth, we know that there are exploits and vulnerabilities <i>everywhere</i>. Ironically, as technologists, we want to believe in technical solutions. At the same time, we also know better than anyone that a determined adversary will find a way to pwn us.<p>For instance, all of your technical &quot;solutions&quot; rely on an up-to-date OS with no zero-day vulnerability, perfect non-exploitable endpoint software, and even full knowledge of our hardware stack, firmware, etc.<p>In general, what you propose is exactly what the NSA would want. And, you will lose. If you are fortunate enough to even know when you&#x27;ve been pwned, you&#x27;ll patch things up until the next time. You&#x27;ll just play cat-and-mouse while your information floats away. Then, at some point, you will say &quot;Wait, this is what we normally do to defend ourselves against criminals. Why am I having to do this to defend against my own government?&quot;<p>At that point, you will realize that this is first and foremost a legal problem. Only then will you demand what I am advocating right now.",1383957057

I&#x27;m not actually running a tally but I believe this story takes the cake, at least over the last few weeks (months?) with currently 750 upvotes vs only 70 comments.<p>In short, I find the number of upvotes divided by the number of comments (or perhaps minus the number of comments) a better metric to determine the &quot;interestingness&quot; of a story compared to the number of upvotes alone.  It&#x27;s not a hard-and-fast rule, but I&#x27;ve noticed myself paying more attention to this dividend/sum recently than to the points alone.<p>I&#x27;ve pondered the thought a little bit over the past few months and of course there are several factors at play here, so there&#x27;s not one single explanation for the phenomenon. But here is one shot:<p>When somebody comments on a story, there&#x27;s an incentive to also upvote it because of the karma system: the more upvotes a story gets that you&#x27;ve commented on, the higher the likelihood that your comment gets upvoted. Perhaps not everybody thinks like that, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say that a good percentage of commenters might upvote a story for their comment&#x27;s sake and not necessarily for the story&#x27;s sake. (Of course that&#x27;s simplifying things: when you comment on a story, you probably also find the story interesting so you might have upvoted it anyway, karma or not.)<p>Anyway, from that perspective, the difference between number of upvotes and number of comments could be termed &quot;genuine upvotes&quot;: people who really just thought it was a cool story, without any second thoughts regarding their karma balance and without necessarily having a strong opinion on the subject matter.<p>There are of course other, and perhaps simpler, factors/explanations: the less comments a story gets, the less controversial it is so if a story gets many upvotes and few comments, then perhaps it simply is uncontroversially good.<p>I&#x27;ve played with the idea of writing an alternate HN interface that uses this metric to weigh stories, but it never got anywhere. And there certainly isn&#x27;t a simple solution: how to combine age, upvotes and number of comments into a useful ranking is black magic at best.<p>Again sorry for this offtopic blurb. It&#x27;s just something I found myself thinking about a bit, and this story seems like a particularly good example.<p>And now back to 3d-inspired 2d awesomeness.

I like how daringly he injects esoteric religious material into conventional 1950s settings. But it was too hard to pull off. None of the characters is captivating and most of them, especially Zooey, are asses in a way that doesn&#x27;t feel entirely intentional.<p>I&#x27;m on a Salinger kick, having run across his books for a couple bucks in a used bookstore and never having read him before. He is a singular writer. <i>Catcher</i> was a freak success. Like Kurt Cobain, Salinger would clearly have been happier as an obscure cult artist. But <i>Catcher</i> was the opening bell of the 60s counterculture just as the 50s were getting started. Once it picked up a wave it became a tsunami.<p>I was surprised at how good the pieces in <i>Nine Stories</i> are, e.g. &quot;The Laughing Man&quot; and &quot;Love and Squalor&quot;. He paints childhood and adolescence beautifully, as well as charming interactions between children and sensitive young men. But it all gives an impression of, um, arrested development. Did he write any great adult characters? The pervy teacher in <i>Catcher</i> doesn&#x27;t count. It seems that adults in Salinger&#x27;s world mostly just get sour, and the one who is clearly his favorite he has blow his brains out in front of his wife.<p>More Salinger books are supposed to be coming out now that he&#x27;s beyond the reach of his fans and the press, and it will be interesting to see on which side of the divide they end up.

The money may seem like a small amount now but bootstrapped generally means strapped, and you will regret it in 6 months if it wasn&#x27;t 100% necessary.<p>Make sure you aren&#x27;t doing this for some protected class reason, not saying you are, just obviously that is a way different situation.<p>Don&#x27;t let anyone convince you to put up with an asshole just because they are smart.  This is one of the worst decisions you can make. I don&#x27;t care how smart someone is, if they aren&#x27;t able to work on a team or work constructively with you get rid of them and do so quickly.  And don&#x27;t try to isolate them, this usually makes the problem worse and again causes you or someone on your team additional work to manage a specialized work breakout, not doable when you are small and bootstrapped.<p>If this was my situation I would likely go down this path. (But make sure you check with the attorney if you aren&#x27;t sure/aware of the laws in your jurisdiction.)  Sit with the individual and have an honest above board conversation (no finger pointing, name calling, etc) and say something to the affect, you are super smart and talented which I respect, but the situation as is can not continue because I do not feel it is in the best interest of the company and also feel it isn&#x27;t good for you or the team (team to be).   So if we can&#x27;t come to some middle ground, it is best for you to find someplace else to be quickly.  But leave the door open to the person wanting to change. Sometimes passion is misunderstood, or mistaken as someone being an asshole when they are really just trying to fight for the company.<p>My own complaint about some of the advice I read here.  Don&#x27;t worry about what might happen/not happen in a month, fix the problem you have today.  Not that you should go blindly, but worrying about what could/couldn&#x27;t happen just paralyzes you in fear and means you will fail.

GE sports a $276 billion market cap, Samsung is at $194 billion.<p>I&#x27;ll say however, that Samsung appears vastly undervalued. GE is trading at about 20 times earnings, Samsung is trading at 20 times just its last quarter alone (and around 5 or 6 times trailing four quarters).<p>Also worth noting, that despite being more profitable than Apple, Samsung trades at a 60% discount to AAPL.",1383955353

Mostly data center costs.<p>Let&#x27;s assume an attacker is very good and needs only 6 months to design his own ASICs and build data centers to host the farm. The network is at 4 Phash/s today, so 6 months from now we should be around 4 * 2^6 = ~250 Phash/s (the network has been doubling in size every month for the past 10 months). The best ASICs, 28nm KncMiner, are approximately 100 ~Ghash/s and 100 Watt each. So an attacker would have to build 250 Phash/s of these to clearly outperform the network: that is 2.5 million chips at 250 megawatt total. And to plan for a potential delay of 30 days in his plan, an attacker would have to build not 250 Phash/s but 500 Phash/s of ASICs to attack the network. 5 million chips. 500 megawatt data center. For comparison, Facebook spent $210 million on their 28 megawatt Prineville data center. So a 500 megawatt data center would probably cost $3-4 billion. Even the well-funded NSA couldn&#x27;t get their comparatively punny Utah data center to run correctly and it has been delayed by more than 1 year: <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2052960/nsa-data-center-suffers-meltdowns-is-delayed-by-a-year-report-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2052960/nsa-data-center-suffe...</a><p>Is China seeing Bitcoin as a threat? No. And even if it was, is it big enough for them to be willing to spend $3-4 billions to destroy it? I don&#x27;t think so.",1383955332

And though nature played a larger part in this powerlessness in the past, it is largely a social problem. But still, this is only even arguable in the states because so much wealth, and so much power, was captured from the rest of the world during the last half of last century. If your supposed lack of suffering (which I would dispute) of some 300m citizens rests on the suffering of a couple of billion in other places, it doesn&#x27;t exactly mean a whole hell of a lot.",1383955310

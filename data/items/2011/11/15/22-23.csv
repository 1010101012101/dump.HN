3240761,comment,3238284,3240669,1,0,fleitz,,,"""durable artifacts that can put architects in dominant positions for years to come"" that statement is why balls of mud work, because the primary alternative to balls of mud are space shuttles designed by architecture astronauts. Space shuttles are generally problems in search of a solution, which is why the ball of mud is seen as the only thing that works. Writing in an imperative language poking and prodding certain bits at certain addresses merely ensures a ball of mud will result.<p>I would never assert that every type of problem should be solved in this manner, but it's a pretty good framework for taking data from a bunch of different sources and outputting them to a bunch of other destinations. Pipeing and transforming data is not fundamentally a problem of hierarchical types (a problem somewhat solved by C++/Java/C#) but type transformation and streams.<p>Keep your business logic and GUIs built in Java but use something like this for moving data around the organization and importing / exporting as needed by clients.",1321397972

Going premed would mean what I'd done was just the beginning not an accomplishment in and of itself. That was daunting and a bit demoralizing. The fact is it's not for everyone, and not just because of the difficulty (I never excelled in math or organic chemistry), and people like me who get in because it's interesting often find that the career paths that present themselves are strictly defined and entail a lot of drudgery. I remember perceiving this very clearly in my 3rd year after doing a lot of prep work and it was an easy decision.

'He went into orbit,' Amelio recalled. Gates found it ridiculous, but perhaps not surprising, that Jobs had pulled off this coup. 'Do you really think Steve Jobs has anything there?' Gates asked Amelio. 'I know his technology, its nothing but a warmed-over UNIX, and youll never be able to make it work on your machines.' Gates, like Jobs, had a way of working himself up, and he did so now: 'Dont you understand that Steve doesnt know anything about technology? Hes just a super salesman. I cant believe youre making such a stupid decision. . . . He doesnt know anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and thinks is wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?' Years later, when I raised it with him, Gates not recall being that upset. The purchase of NeXT, he argued, did not really give Apple a new operating system. 'Amelio paid a lot for NeXT, and lets be frank, the NeXT OS was never really used.' Instead the purchase ended up bringing in Avie Tevanian, who could help the existing Apple operating system evolve so that it eventually incorporated the kernel of the NeXT technology. Gates knew that the deal was destined to bring Jobs back to power. 'But that was a twist of fate,' he said. 'What they ended up buying was a guy who most people would not have predicted would be a great CEO, because he didnt have much experience at it, but he was a brilliant guy with great design taste and great engineering taste. He suppressed his craziness enough to get himself appointed interim CEO.'\n""""""\nIsaacson, Walter (2011-10-24). Steve Jobs (pp. 302-303). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition.",1321395228

Possibly one day a CS PhD.<p>I have TA'd students and have long had an abiding interest in educational curricula, stemming from my experienced being homeschooled, where as I grew older, I was able to select elective materials to study in cooperation with my parents.<p>There are a few highlighter reasons I believe STEM education has issues, and please remember that these are interlinked, and other issues are present, which also interlink into these issues. I've picked these because I think they are standout.<p>* ROI on engineering vs. ROI on the MBA course. Non-founder engineers cap their salary potential in their career, in general, and spend gruelling hours in classes. MBA's salary cap is higher to non-existent, and can apparently skiv off pretty easy in undergraduate years.<p>* Math education is generally <i>broken</i> in the US. That means that students are not ready for the rigourous thinking and numeracy demanded in STEM. They struggle understanding the basics of mathematics and computational thinking because they never have had it before, so the 'elite' students who do know what they are doing stand out.<p>* Hacker/elite snobs pissing on other classmates. This has happened to a few friends of mine, but not really to me. Some of the freshmen/sophomores really brag on their ability (i.e., they were coder geeks in high school) and this discourages other people. It's toxic.<p>* Gender imbalance and lousy social environment.  A bunch of stinky guys geeking out over computers and video games which are outdated in a few years is not... primo.<p>* Young software engineers are expected to spend nearly every waking minute coding, just to have a chance to get a job. They need to get internships, contribute to open source, maybe build a mobile app, etc... and do well in class. This, as near as I can tell, is very rare. Only perhaps musicians have similar expectations.  Spending this much time on your field is corrosive to your character and personality (see above two points).<p>* Culture heroes are entertainers and sports stars. Not makers of useful things.<p>* Focus on application instead of theory. Everyone wants to do something real cool right now, preferably yesterday, without any training.  This is not realistic when laying the foundations for a solid career. Short-term thinking says, ""pleasure now, pay later"", which does not work well in STEM.",1321395175

But just because Isaacson captured  how Steve Jobs could be both terrible and compelling doesn't mean Isaacson succeeded. He didn't. He missed the point entirely about why people want to read about Jobs. We didn't buy the book to learn about Jobs' strained relations with his children or what he remembers about ex-girlfriends from 30 years ago. We bought it to find out how he managed to be the right guy in the right place at the right time, time and time again, realigning entire industries to his interests.<p>Isaacson had a chance to uncover what made Steve Jobs tick. To understand how Jobs made the company that made the iPhone, the iPad, the Mac, and put giant footprints on the PC, music, filmmaking, and telecom industries. Instead we got armchair psychology and a rehash of ""he's demanding to the point of being unbearable but he usually makes good calls."" Why could Steve Jobs create Apple and not anybody else? He's not the only visionary in Silicon Valley and certainly not the only asshole. So why, with unprecedented access to Jobs and everyone he's worked with, could Isaacson not tell us anything new?<p>Maybe if you think Jobs wasn't anything special, just a fortunate narcissist, you'd be satisfied with the book. Obviously he'd be nothing without people, like Woz, Hertzfield, Tribble, Tevanian, Ive, Catmull, Lasseter, and many others who did incredible work that he could never do himself. But even that perspective leaves the question of why so many geniuses did their best work when they worked with Jobs.<p>Isaacson doesn't even address how Jobs learned how to run companies. I'd argue that the pivotal moment for this occurs during the NeXT days, covered by Isaacson only superficially. But NeXT is clearly the turning point of Jobs' career. Everything he did up till and including NeXT ended in flames. But after, it's success after success. How then did he finally manage to not alienate everybody and go down in a blaze of glory? How did he hang onto his team from NeXT use them to remake Apple? Not to mention Isaacson failed to understand that how NeXT's system became the foundation of everything important Apple has done since (OS X and iOS are both direct descendants of NeXT's OS).<p>Nor do we learn about how he worked with any of his trusted lieutenants besides Ive, like Tim Cook, Avie Tevanian, Phil Schiller, or Scott Forstall. We don't even get a sense of why they stuck by him or bought into his vision. We get some insight into the Woz relationship, but still not why they succeeded when others failed.<p>Isaacson had the chance to tell the story of a remarkable life in business, but he demurred.

But as users demand smaller devices and more portability I'm beginning to wonder if these ""unconventional"" alternatives are not generally useful for others besides me.<p>Not only do I divorce the OS from the hardware, but I separate the OS from my personal data.  Unless I have both wholly residing in RAM (which I find generally faster than HDD or USB/SD), they are not on the same media.  As much as possible I try to make the OS read-only and the media used for data (e.g. RAM for short-term data storage or HDD for long-term data storage) read-write.  Perhaps there are parallels to certain object file formats and their separation of code and data.<p>I've also thought a lot about and experimented with the use of separate, simplified, fast-booting OS's for different purposes.  I am forced to use different OS's to perform certain tasks. But the popular all-purpose OS's are huge and often I only need a small fraction of their functionality.<p>What if we did not think in all or nothing terms about OS functionality?  What if some OS's were small and only limited-purpose?<p>Rebooting is the slow step.  But these limited-purpose OS's, being small and simple, can be very robust and responsive once booted.<p>The smaller the kernel and userland, the more RAM I have for storage.",1321394783

After all, that is part of what made Jobs noteworthy. The book is full of detailed examples from early Apple history, but that's only because they've been well documented by other people.<p>Likewise, he barely touches on Jobs personal beliefs and his connection to Zen Buddhism. Wouldn't it be interesting to ask Jobs more about that? We only get a few quotes, the most substantial is lifted from his graduation speech.",1321394698

3240499,comment,3239815,3239815,8,0,rayiner,,,"I sometimes regret not switching out of my aerospace engineering major. I went to a good undergraduate engineering school (Georgia Tech), and frankly the educational experience was terrible. Professors who weren't engaged, TA's who couldn't speak English well enough to easily convey the material, exams that were unrelated to what was taught in class, etc. I had a few great professors, but they were few and far between.<p>When I left engineering to go to a smallish private law school, I had a totally different experience. Classes taught entirely by professors. Maximum of ~60 students per class and more typically 20-30 in upper-level courses. Professors who would engage the class in hypotheticals rather than just dryly recount the rules. Exams that actually tested the material we learned.<p>The fundamental problem is that engineering schools, especially the big state ones like Berkeley, Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia Tech, are research factories. They crank out certain amount of BS's to meet industry demand for engineers, but their investment in those graduates seems minimal at best.<p>Now, don't get me wrong. I think an undergraduate degree in engineering is still the best way to go (as long as you can hack the math and it won't kill your GPA). Even if you ultimately want to do law, finance, or consulting, people really do take you more seriously. But at the same time, I really can't blame people when they stay away from STEM majors, especially ones that test well and know they will be able to go to a top graduate school with their liberal arts degree.",1321394440

C/C++/Rust) or system specific language (eg. Java/Swift/Objective-C) and it should be easier to make cross platform - hiding the dirty FFI crap.<p>Dart is much closer to C# than you think, go look at some examples - it&#x27;s quite a productive language from my experience with it so far.<p>Custom GUI framework means it doesn&#x27;t behave/look the same as native framework (just like webview tech) but at the same time it can also mean higher performance (certainly better than WebView), consistent behavior between platforms and versions (faster development), etc.<p>Overall I like it, I can see a GUI framework on same tech built for desktop (custom widgets but same rendering principles) and doing client side development in Dart sounds great - fast prototyping and iteration because of it&#x27;s dynamic nature but the optional type system gives you same guarantees as C#/Java type systems.",1446802904

Every single image operator gets really tricky if you work in 8-bit sRGB and most don&#x27;t bother, i.e. they treat 0-255 as linear values and everything from anti-aliasing to blitting to blurring is absolutely broken in all standard desktop applications. It&#x27;s a bit better if you do 3d rendering with OpenGL/Direct3D, since their entire pipeline is linear and all you have to do is set the &quot;this texture is in sRGB colourspace&quot; bit on every texture and convert the final colour from linear RGB to sRGB in your shader.",1446802866

10518529,comment,10518033,10518340,0,0,discreteevent,,,"&quot;It&#x27;s strange how much it looks like web development&quot; - It looks a bit like a browser for native app development. To me it looks like it could be the solution to a lot of problems. What is good about the web for applications is that it is write once run everywhere (because people do not expect a native look and feel) and also that it is zero install. What is bad about the web for applications it is that it is designed for content presentation and not applications. For mobile it has a number of things that limit it for performance. To get something to even approach decent performance I have to try to understand a complex and opaque machine called the browser. Compared to native app development this is a lot more difficult. The machine is working against me because its primary concern is document layout.<p>So it looks to me like a browser for applications in resource constrained environments (mobile). I see nothing wrong with this; We used to have innovations like this all the time but since the browser came along its been a bit of a tyranny of orthodoxy. Why not have a browser for documents and a browser for applications? I certainly don&#x27;t like web apps in my browser for content sites. (They don&#x27;t work at all, or the scrolling is all over the place or they burn up my battery).<p>For the moment though they seem to be clear that flutter is for application development on android and ios only and won&#x27;t run everywhere. Plus Apple will probably never allow zero install (which knocks out half of my &quot;browser for applications&quot; theory, the other half being write once run anywhere)",1446802339

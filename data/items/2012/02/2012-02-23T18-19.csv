3626199,comment,3624505,3624505,11,0,enochroot,,,"I-banker here. I deal with similar situations on fairly regular basis.<p>Couple of tips:<p>- NDA is useless. Sign it but don't expect them to adhere to it. Even if they don't, it's extremely difficult to prove a breach (they likely won't be disclosing it to others anyway, just using it against you).<p>- Ask them how they plan to price your assets - is it based on your financials, your technology, your customers, etc. This may disqualify them right away: e.g. they tell you is that they only look for revenue growth while you think your technology is the most important part of the company.<p>- Have them give you a formal presentation on their company and where they see your firm fitting in. This really serves 3 purposes: \na) allows you to see how they are approaching the market and whether they've thought this through or if it's a fly-by. If this is a random ""let's see if we can buy this cheap"" situation, they'll likely be reluctant to spend quality time with you; \nb) you will learn what their pain points are, which will give you leverage later, if the acquisition progresses;  \nc) probably most important, you will spend time together and will start to get a sense on whether you can trust them. Establishing a beginning of a professional  relationship goes a long way for you (e.g. sometimes you just know if the other person is a charlatan or if they are a straight shooter) and for them (they start developing a level of trust and are not as suspicious you'll trick THEM)<p>- after the initial meeting, share your concerns and ask them for suggestions on what they would do if they were in your shoes<p>There's more, feel free to reach out to me directly if you'd like.",1330023589

Apparently Claude Shannon and Edward Thorp built something similar in 1960 too.<p>I worked for Steve Mann (I was an undergrad research assistant; more a learning experience than actually doing anything useful beyond sysadminning), who mainly did ""painting with light"" and other digital photography things, using his WearComp platform as a tool (he'd been developing it since the early 1980s).  He also wore a 5W radio transmitter on his head (to get 56Kbps data back in the late 1990s).  He's now at U of Toronto.  (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann</a>)<p>Thad Starner (now at GA Tech) and Lenny Foner were probably doing the most useful general wearable computing work at the time.

Stuff ran linux, and it wasn't too hard to bring up QVGA X11 or an 80x24 console.<p>The thing I wanted to build, given the tech at the time, was a purely auditory wearable computer.  Even in 2012, displays are kind of inadequate, but we have had viable portable audio sources (headphones) for decades.

It's a direct successor and competitor to the iPhone, and the direction of Android in it's current form has been and is extremely influenced by what Apple has been doing.<p>Sure, the iPhone is a bunch of ""stolen"" technologies and ideas, but Apple brought them together to make something great in a way that had never been done before. What Apple did took vision, discipline, and execution. <i>That</i> is what Apple brought to the table, and that is what innovation is.<p>Nobody was making products that resembled the iPhone before Apple, but now everyone is trying.<p>We don't need to get all emotional about this. This doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the products, it's just the history about how this stuff came about. You are still free to like Android or WebOS or iOS or whatever you want.

However, to be educated or have an education, at the end of the day, you need to get something right.<p>Personally, I don't learn by failing fifty times and never succeeding. I don't learn how to lose weight if I try fifty diets and never lose a pound. I don't learn how to talk to a girl if I speak with a dozen of them and get shot down every time. I don't learn how to rockclimb by falling off the rock and never gaining elevation.<p>That is negative re-enforcement. I have learned what not to do--the opposite of what I set out to accomplish. Education is progressive. I learn by failing until I succeed, if only a little bit. Then I go back and try to succeed even more. That's the hard part, not calling it quits.

It's a straightforward use of closures to implement switching on boolean truth values; it removes one concept that's frequently fundamental in languages, at the expense of making the language harder to analyze statically. Rather than being able to infer conditional control flow syntactically, you need data flow analysis; and without static types, you don't know for sure that something is even boolean until runtime. I'm not sure the beauty outweighs the costs.<p>I think your reaction - seeing it as beautiful - is more likely if you're relatively new to closures and code as data. The fact that treating code as data lets you write your control flow as libraries, doesn't mean that it is <i>good</i> to write your control flow via libraries. The power of an abstraction is not necessarily well correlated with the desirability of its use; I rather suspect the reverse may be the case.",1330022591

I know I can have a completely digital banking solution, with even phone support 24/7 if I need it, but I don't want that. \nBanking and my money is important to me, and when I need advice or have problems, I want to walk into a branch and speak with a real person. I'm not a dinosaur or a luddite - I'm 24, and I'm well versed in emerging technology.<p>I feel even more strongly about my health: I don't care that I can take a picture of my ear drum and send it to a doctor  and have an antibiotic prescription that I can forward to my pharmacy and pick up in 30 minutes: there is something wrong with my body, I am concerned, this is important to me, and I want to speak to someone who is trained, credible, and can offer medical advice. The trouble with digital services that attempt to melt themselves into the physical world is that important things need to be dealt with by people. A doctor offers credibility and that is what I want. A 99c iPhone app offers no credibility, and for important things, credibility is important. If a doctor waves off my ear problem as ""sleep on it for a few days, here's a note"", I trust his advice and I'm more than willing to go through with it. If an iPhone app told me the same, I'd be probably reaching for the uninstall button around the time I'm dialing a doctor to make an appointment.<p>1.

3626054,comment,3625181,3625513,18,0,kevinalexbrown,,,"EDIT: So I got a coke and thought about this a bit. I like your point, but I feel like maybe the high-noters are high-noters precisely <i>because</i> they're ruthlessly self-critical and growth-minded. Ever see someone who was really good at something cringe after what you thought was an amazing performance, because they missed, e.g. the f6 in Mozart's Queen of the Night? They're better (honest?) at seeing their mistakes, and they're better at addressing them. Maybe that's the natural talent?<p>Aside from the tone, maybe, this article is not 'one for the masses.'<p>Jony Ive didn't just sit down and whip up the iPod, to use Spolsky's example. We don't see the blood/sweat/tears that goes into it. From Ive:<p><i>One of the hallmarks of our team is this sense of looking to be wrong ... It’s about being excited to be wrong because then you’ve discovered something new.</i><p>Obviously Ive has the creative ingredient. And some are going to be predisposed with talent. Michael Jordan may have had his famous ""4am club"" where he hit the court every morning to just drill, but so did Scotty Pippen, and he never hit the Jordan high note clutch performances that make my jaw drop watching 20-year-old replays. So I see your point, that talent matters. But the other way to look at it is that Jordan was just better at learning from his mistakes in those 4am practices.<p>So no, this is not some pedestrian piece of feel-good soup. Great work, in programming, design, anything, is about repeatedly pushing a boundary, recognizing where you messed up, fixing it, and repeating that all over again. The people who do this best are the people who believe that by iterating they can get better. This works even as you get all the way up into the stratosphere of a field.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1367481/Apples-Jonathan-Ive-How-did-British-polytechnic-graduate-design-genius.html#ixzz1nEKjLSAN"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1367481/Appl...</a>",1330021615

I'm arguing in favor of a fiscally responsible government - we had one of those 12 to 13 years ago, and for most of US history we've had a responsible government that kept our debt and deficits low. The greenback became ""good as gold"" because we were responsible with our currency (once upon a time).<p>You want to spend $50 billion a year on food stamps? Ok, slash it out of the military, social security, medicare, the NSA / FBI / CIA / HSA / TSA / whatever. You want universal healthcare, ok, disband the US military, or slash social security in half. Something will have to go, one way or another, sooner rather than later; the piper will get paid.<p>With a $1.3 trillion deficit, it's irrelevant if you argue that the food stamps are paid for by taxes, or if you argue the military is paid for by taxes, or if you argue social security is paid for with taxes. Because bottom line: $1.3 trillion per year is not paid for with taxes. Something is not getting paid for with taxes, it might as well be food stamps as any other program currently.<p>As another simple example of the inflation spread - if the Fed holds interest rates down, which is part of what the QE programs do, it generates inflation. When you get a mortgage adjustment at 4% courtesy of that Fed program, it is generating inflation by the difference in money you now have versus what you otherwise would have.<p>If the Fed props up property values with the QE and trillion dollar mortgage purchase programs, that causes inflation as home owners acquire value they otherwise wouldn't have.<p>Any artificial value, created by the Fed, and shot into the system, must inherently become inflation. Your dollar loses value accordingly. And since 1967 or so, the dollar has lost about 86% of its value.",1330020644

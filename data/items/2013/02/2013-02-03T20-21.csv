Yaml or in general object instantiation is the attack vector - and admittedly a particularly stupid and painful one - but the real vulnerability is sharing code via unsigned repositories. There are more vectors to break into a repository server. So the more serious problem is ""How do we secure code?"" and ""How do we establish trust for shared code?""<p>This issue will follow us around for quite a bit, even after the YAML bugs have been fixed and gemcutter rebuilt.

And that's a point where python is not substantially better of than ruby, heck, even PHP (packagist), node (npm) and java (Maven) are in the same boat here.

There are scientists in psychology, and they publish scientific papers, but this cannot by itself turn psychology into a science.<p>If I publish an astrology paper, one that meets all the requirements for a scientific paper, have I made astrology a science? No? Why not?<p>Since your claim is that psychology is a science, show me the evidence that prevents psychologists from practicing Recovered Memory Therapy. In fact there is no such evidence, and psychologists are free to practice Recovered Memory Therapy. The only difference from the 1990s is that courts of law have ruled that they will no longer hear cases in which recovered memories are the primary evidence. In other words, the social corrections made to prevent further injustices took place outside the field.<p>> Read this article.

There are no subjects, no measurements, no control group, and no quantitative statistics.<p>And you certainly chose a typical psychology paper.

This article reviews the problems with this practice, including near universal misinterpretation of p as the probability that H is false, the misinterpretation that its complement is the probability of successful replication, and the mistaken assumption that if one rejects H one thereby affirms the theory that led to the test. Exploratory data analysis and the use of graphic methods, a steady improvement in and a movement toward standardization in measurement, an emphasis on estimating effect sizes using confidence intervals, and the informed use of available statistical methods are suggested. For generalization, psychologists must finally rely, as has been done in all the older sciences, on replication.""<p>Needless to say, in psychology, replication is still nearly unheard of.<p>Another reference:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychologists-to-clean-up-their-act-1.11535"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/nobel-laureate-challenges-psychol...</a><p>Title: ""Nobel laureate challenges psychologists to clean up their act""<p>Quote: ""Nobel prize-winner Daniel Kahneman has issued a strongly worded call to one group of psychologists to restore the credibility of their field by creating a replication ring to check each others' results. ... 'For all these reasons, right or wrong, your field is now the poster child for doubts about the integrity of psychological research,' Kahneman writes. 'I believe that you should collectively do something about this mess.'""<p>It seems the psychologists to which Kahneman addressed this call to action, have not acted.<p>> The problem with comparing p-values between psychology and particle physics is statistical.<p>Now you're making my points for me, and it's not the first time this has happened. The experimental groups in psychology are too small for the prevailing statistical methods to produce anything but conjecture, as the above article shows, and as you point out:<p>> In psychology, there may be 2 groups of 30 participants being examined with a crucial manipulation. So there's ONE Fisher-type statistical comparison with a relatively few degrees of freedom (because there aren't millions of subjects)<p>Yep. It's not science, it's anecdote. And the plural of anecdote is not data. Replication would help, but that's an unrealistic expectation.<p>> Psychology uses indirect measurements of cognitive/behavioural phenomena <i>just like particle physicists</i>.

And biology, and geology, and medicine.<p>In case you think I'm psychology's only critic, here is what the sitting director of the NIMH recently had to say about it in Scientific American:<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circ...</a><p>Quote: ""In most areas of medicine, doctors have historically tried to glean something about the underlying cause of a patients illness before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem.

For example, Darwin's Origin of Species contains a pitfall in that its readers can be persuaded to believe certain families of mankind are less evolved than others.  Similarly, Marx's  Capital and Manifesto of the Communist Party can lead one to believe that inequality is purely a function of material possession.

Socrates' dialogs stand as examples of the traditional Western method of exploring ideas, wherein one man questions another with the object of mutually understanding the essence of a thing, or, by being prodded toward future learning when having reached an uncomfortable ataraxy.

He was a bit light on details, but the basic idea of his approach was this:<p>1. You narrow down the geographic location of your target.  Not hard in the case of the Silk Road, since there is a physical package being shipped.<p>2. You connect to your target's system, and modulate the latency of packets that you send.  This is a covert channel.<p>3. You have a van rolling around the geographic region you believe the target to be in, and listen on wifi frequencies.  When the covert channel is detected, you home in until you have located the target computer.<p>Obviously you can defend against this sort of attack by just not using wifi, although similar attacks at the ISP level are possible.  Cover traffic helps with this, assuming the covert channel has low tolerance to noise (this may not be true; again, few details were given).  It is also wise to avoid connecting from your house, if possible, and to use a public location where you can quickly shut down your laptop when you see the cops.<p>Or, you know, you could not sell large quantities of illegal drugs over the Internet, since it is basically asking for trouble.",1359924224

5161026,comment,5159723,5159723,2,0,pbbakkum,,,"This is the 3rd or 4th time I've seen this article in the past few days so I've decided to post my take. I work with Mongo in a production scenario but I'm hesitant to post because these things tend to turn into a pointless argument. So let me stress: this is not an attack on the blog post, I'm hoping to improve the discussion here. Here goes:<p>- ""It lies."" Mongo used to have a default where a driver would fire off a write and not check that it succeeded with the server. This was very obviously a decision made to improve benchmark performance, though I imagine a benchmark with only default settings would be rather naive. Regardless, yes, the default was a stupid corporate decision but it is well known and should be apparent if you're deploying a Mongo cluster. Additionally, as the author notes, this default has changed and this entire point is no longer a concern.<p>- ""Its Slow."" A real point he raises is that its a little wonky you need to send a separate message for getLastError. I suspect this is an artifact of Mongo's historical internal structure. <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/mongodb-wire-protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.mongodb.org/meta-driver/latest/legacy/mongodb-wi...</a> . If you look at the wire protocol, I think it is designed such that only the OP_QUERY and OP_GET_MORE message types get an OP_REPLY back. getLastError is a command, which are run through an OP_QUERY message. He notes that using this check affects performance. It does, but lets dig into this:<p>""Using this call requires doubling the cost of every write operation."" If the author benchmarked this, I suspect he would find that it vastly more than doubles the latency of a single write operation from the client's perspective. My understanding is that when performing this kind of safe write, the driver sends an OP_INSERT, for which it doesn't have to wait for a reply, then immediately sends an OP_QUERY message (getLastError), on which it hangs waiting for the OP_REPLY. In other words, this is now slower because we've created a synchronous operation immediately after just firing off the insert command. Again, its a little wonky that we send Mongo two messages, but one is immediately after the other and that is vastly overshadowed by the fact that we now have to wait for a reply. I believe 1 synchronous send and receive is unavoidable to ensure a safe write in ANY system, and the argument about sending 2 messages really boils down to sending about 200 bytes over a socket vs 400 bytes, I personally don't worry about it.<p>- ""It doesn't work pipelined / it doesn't work multithreaded."" He is also missing the real complexity here, and this is where I have a problem with this blog post because this is not a theoretical discussion, if its content is true then it should just be proven rather than FUD launched into the world. As noted in the docs ( <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/getLastError/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/getLastErro...</a> ), getLastError applies for the socket over which the command was run, so its up to the driver to execute the getLastError on the same socket as the write, which is an implementation detail and a solved problem. The way the drivers do this in practice is you set the write concern and the driver takes care of the rest. If you run getLastError manually then it depends on the driver, but for Java the correct procedure is addressed at <a href=""http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java-concurrency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java-concurrency/</a> . So for the fastest possible safe performance, you multithread (which is effectively pipelining from the server's perspective) and run operations with the driver's thread-safe connection pool. Suffice to say people actually use these drivers in a multithreaded context in the real world, and they work.<p>- ""WriteConcerns are broken."" There are several relevant settings here, including write concern acknowledgement and fsync, the author is confused about how these map to the Java driver WriteConcern enum values. The acknowledgement setting (elegantly stored in a variable named ""w"", thanks 10gen) is the number of replicas that must confirm the write before the driver believes it has succeeded. I personally set this to 1, but you could potentially wait for the entire replica set to acknowledge. The fsync setting is whether or not this acknowledgement means that the server on these machines has completed the write in memory, or actually synced the data to disk. I set this to false for performance. There is an excellent StackOverflow answer on Java Mongo driver configuration at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6520439/how-to-configure-mongodb-java-driver-mongooptions-for-production-use"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6520439/how-to-configure-...</a> .<p>The author also spends time noting that if you only ensure the write succeeds on a single machine, and you irreparably lose that machine before replication, then the data is lost. This is obviously true for every distributed system.<p>I've used a 4-shard Mongo in a production multithreaded environment that handled several hundred million writes. For part of this period our cluster was extremely unstable because of a serious data corrupting Mongo bug (more on this in a second). I haven't done a full audit but based on our logs, in about 6 months I've seen exactly 1 write go missing, so I'm personally not concerned about the things mentioned in the blog post. I've also been happy with performance as long as the data size comes under the memory limit. If your data exceeds memory, Mongo essentially falls on its face, though this is hard to avoid when a query requires disk accesses.<p>Mongo is not without its problems, however. As I mentioned, QA is a real concern, we hit a subtle bug when we upgraded to v2.2 that caused data corruption when profiling was turned on and the cluster was under high load. It was very difficult to debug, and basically should have been caught by 10gen before their release.<p>Another serious problem is that sharding configuration is still somewhat immature, and it seems like every new release is described as ""well it used to be bad, we finally fixed it"". Here is an example: you pick a shard key that can't be split into small enough chunks, and now shard balancing silently fails. Ok, so you pick a better shard key, but you can't migrate shard keys, so you have to drop the collection and start again. Except dropping a collection distributed across a cluster is buggy, so you can't recreate the collection with the same name and a different shard key. So you just pick a new name for your collection, and you have this weird broken state for the original one sitting around forever unless you completely blast your cluster and start from scratch. This sort of thing is not fun!<p>Mongo has many pros and cons, personally I think its real advantage is simplicity for developers which makes it worth putting up with the other stuff.

  Gieringer (1985) estimates the loss of life from delay

Determining whether something is ""safe"" or ""effective"" isn't just about quantifying data; it's fundamentally a value judgment.  Whether a drug is ""safe"" depends on how much risk the patient is willing to bear.  Whether it's ""effective"" depends on what results the patient finds satisfactory.  These are deeply intimate and personal judgments that are rightly the patient's to make.<p>The problem with the FDA is that it doesn't actually supply the data in a way accessible to patients at all; instead it usurps their inherent right to make their own value judgments regarding their health, and simply allows or denies <i>everyone</i> access to the drug/procedure according to its own criteria.<p>> A similar case, with less emotional charge, is the need of regulation of airplanes.<p>Well, no, this isn't similar at all.  It's far, far easier to generalize the risk/reward tradeoffs of flying in an airplane: people want to arrive at their intended destination on time, without being killed or injured in the process.  A plane trip lasts a few hours, and has essentially no lasting consequences for a passenger once he disembarks; unlike medicine, flying on a plane doesn't have vast consequences for the quality and quantity of one's subsequent life.<p>Plane trips, like hard drives, are both commodity goods for which the intended results and acceptable risks can be assumed in advance.

5160900,comment,5160713,5160844,2,0,_delirium,,,"There are definite similarities, though I think Stoicism and Buddhism have fairly different philosophical motivations and conclusions. In particular, Stoicism tends to emphasize rationalism more, and is less suspicious of attachment to the self (if anything, being in favor of cultivating the self). It's a fairly complex topic and there are a dozen variants of both Buddhism and Stoicism, so that's probably wrong as a generalization, but it seems to me to be where the emphases are.<p>This random Google Books result expands on a comparison along those lines: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=yLQ-GQTcwVkC&pg=PA67"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=yLQ-GQTcwVkC&pg=PA67</a>",1359921692

Btrees, for small keyed associations, have a much better ""branching factor per cache line."" This means that fewer cache misses are needed to find relevant items (insert, delete, read, ), because the trees are shallower, and the cost of a cache miss on a btree node isn't much more expensive than an R-B node.<p>Benchmark everything and tune your B-Tree container size appropriately, definitely. You could even instantiate the template with multiple different sizes at compile time and benchmark them at run-time, then elect the most efficient implementation for the hardware currently being used.",1359921644

I can't express the contempt I have for techers who would cheat like that.<p>For me personally, I did not attend Caltech in order to get good grades. What I learned there has given me a huge advantage in my career. Interestingly, my experience with Caltech's honor system has also shaped my interactions with others for the better.

7471275,comment,7470633,7471108,10,0,tim333,,,"Apparently historically many of the rules came about during the early 20th century US oil boom. Guys used to go door to door selling shares in can&#x27;t go wrong oil stocks and then not only did some wells not work but often there were no wells at all and the insiders just stole the money. There was political outcry so laws were passed to stop selling direct to small investors. The rational to allowing wealthy investors to punt is that a) they can afford to lose, or at least do so quietly without causing a political stink, and b) can afford professional advice and get their accountant to have a look and so on. Investor protection laws are still useful - there are plenty of scammers out there - but I think could be updated. For example the government could have lawyers and accountants at least check out the money was being invested in a business and not just paid out to the insiders. In the UK we have some equity crowd funding which seems to kind of work.",1395802745
7471274,comment,7468193,7468193,2,0,quarterwave,,,"Start with different people talking all at once - some loudly, some softly. We can try and make out what someone is saying, but it&#x27;s not easy. So we put each person on a different radio station & we then &#x27;tune&#x27; our radio with a little knob and dial.<p>If our ears could hear radio frequencies - like AM1070 - then each station by itself would sound like a dull drone or a tuning fork. It&#x27;s dull because it&#x27;s repetitive - it sounds the same this second as it sounded the previous one. To make the drone interesting we multiply it with a person&#x27;s voice signal (say from a microphone or rolling tape) - then the drone kind of goes wah-wuh-wuh-wah, and this &#x27;modulated&#x27; signal is a lot more interesting.<p>That&#x27;s basically the Fourier transform - a sum of Speech.Station signals, where Speech is interesting and Station is repetitive.<p>---<p>We can play this same game with the speech itself - or music. Think of each note do-re-mi-... as radio stations, and the pressure applied to each key of the piano as the speech. So, music can be represented by a combination of the form KeyPressure.MusicalNote. The KeyPressure sequence can be recorded in a music sheet. The notes themselves are boring (as the kids say in The Sound of Music, the notes don&#x27;t <i>mean</i> anything), it&#x27;s the &quot;multiplication and sum&quot; with the KeyPressure sequence that makes music.<p>Again, note the summation overy x.y terms, where x is interesting and y is repetitive - that&#x27;s the Fourier transform.<p>Historical sidelight:\nThe simplest sheet music is Morse code, dah-dit. When telegraph became a booming business there was a shortage of wires to handle the volume of messages. People wanted a way to send more Morse per wire. Alexander Graham Bell had a bright idea - this was a few decades before radio - he took several Morse streams & put each dit-dah-dah-dit-dah sequence onto separate notes (like do-re-mi), and then sent the lot down a single wire. As he played with his system he had the deep insight that if the Morse code was replaced by sheet notation, then he could transmit music down a wire - and that became the telephone!",1395802718

First, it&#x27;s a peripheral. You&#x27;ll need to convince people to buy another 300-400 USD of gear on top of a powerful computer OR a PS4. The PS4 may be winning on the market, but peripherals have a bad History of not selling very well on consoles. Even the Kinect, which sold relatively quite a lot on Xbox360, failed to deliver anything really revolutionary.<p>For PC gamers, you&#x27;ll probably need a very powerful graphics card to make full use of it, and we already know that this kind of market is already a small minority in terms of PC users.<p>There are several issues with VR as well: it&#x27;s not something you can use to replace the screen completely. You&#x27;ll probably feel dizzy, nauseous, tired after some time with it. Your eyes will end up hurting. It will work well with cockpit-like simulators (and there aren&#x27;t many of them left anymore...) but not so well with FPS where camera movements have to be extremely fast. There are other games (3rd person view ones, top view games) where using an Occulus won&#x27;t really make sense anyway.<p>As for social applications, I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s already possible to do videoconference in pretty good quality but few companies actually use it, and still fly people all over the world because they find it works better to have face to face contact to solve issues and discuss projects. I&#x27;m not too sure the benefits of VR will outweigh its disadvantages in the everyday world.<p>And this is coming from someone who badly wants a consumer Rift for gaming.",1395801661

For example, is it OK for the function cross itself?  Can I represent an arbitrary shape in 2D with this method?  What happens if the line has to jump?  Is that OK or not?  Is it accidental, or on purpose, that the line comes back to meet itself at the end?  Why is the function we&#x27;re representing (in the epicycle example) in 2D but we usually take the Fourier transform of 1D functions?  Where did complex numbers come in?  What is complex exponentiation?  What&#x27;s an integral?<p>The square wave example does better.  You can just use pure sines or cosines, so you don&#x27;t have to introduce complex numbers.  You don&#x27;t have the 2D vs. 1D issue.  You don&#x27;t need an integral.  So with less folderol, you get to about the same level of understanding as in the given example.<p>On the other hand, I really like the epicycle example as a machine learning or sparse basis example.

I can&#x27;t speak to civil unions in the UK but in New Zealand there were definite rights that were excluded from civil unions (adoption being one) so the argument to have it be recognized as one entity so that distinctions can&#x27;t be made is a fair one.<p>As to forcing a church to marry two people I&#x27;m torn. I put it in the ball park of refusing to marry those of a different race or have mixed race weddings. I think you can make the argument that any religion that has a form of tax exemption could be required to not discriminate and hold basic human rights.

Every bug, email, social-media thing, log entry, bill, server, etc., is on me ... that shit is overwhelming.  So I decided to adopt a more &quot;go as you please&quot; policy... only work on things I was interested in or was a blocking issue.  I found my burn-outs reduced quite a bit, and now I can see them coming on a lot sooner.  On top of that, I get to take breaks from bug fixes to tinker with R&D stuff to remind myself why I&#x27;m doing this, what I&#x27;m working toward ... which turns into longer working hours with fewer burnouts and more progress ... which is good because it&#x27;s all on me.  So that means my schedule is usually up by 8:30am, showering and coding by 9am and working and taking breaks as I feel like it to be honest.  And if something comes up, I try to do that unless I have something that really gets done (like a blocking issue).  So a lot of time it can be writing docs at 3:30am because I can&#x27;t sleep, working 18 hours straight, or taking a weekend to read or visit friends because I&#x27;ve been burning out on a bug.

I would go so far as to hold that this is more important than correctly deciding today the issue of slavery, of civil rights, of women voting, of gay rights, or any other movement of that sort: because it is the principle which gives society the freedom to raise the questions which these rights movements addressed.

I&#x27;d argue though that in those cases the goal is to cancel out disadvantages (directly or inderectly) directly related to inherent parts of a person (sex,handicap,race) or are benefits that a person can generally choose to acquire (old age,veteran,handicap;) ).<p>In the case of maternity leave it cancels out the propensity to fire/not hire a woman because she can get pregnant and is likely to be required to raise the kid for the first few months. Native cards to reduce inherent inequality produced by past events. Handicap to allow the handicapped to function to a level similiar to the non handicapped. \nWere as age benefits in theory apply to anyone who doesn&#x27;t croak and presumably if they so desired. Veterans choose to serve the country and are compensated by society at large, admittedly you could argue not all people can join the military so fair point there. Food stamps, just lose all your money.<p>So onto gay marriage. Marriage is both a legal construct and a religious construct but the government can only recognize the legal part (seperation of church and state). Now the government is currently not recognizing that the couple can be together based on the sex of the partners which is something they can&#x27;t change (reasonably(you could argue for separate drinking fountains on the basis that skin colour can be medically altered if you think this is reasonable)), you can argue that the marriage is for reproduction but sterile couples can get married, you could argue the child is adversely affected this has been shown not to be the case, you could argue friends will cheat the system but that can already be the case, the issue is the government has no reason to grant the various special right (tax,visitation laws, adoption) to a couple based on the sex of the people in the couple.<p>The key to that argument is that the government can&#x27;t use the religious part of marriage as a basis for their decision. It&#x27;s also worth noting that even if the government allows gay marriage that only guarantees you can get married in a courthouse, nothing about churches would be guaranteed (or in theory enforceable if they decided to say you could).",1395799606

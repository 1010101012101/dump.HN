I envision myself using something like this to plan a meeting. So say I'm a boss and I want to see when my employees are free. Right now as the site stands, they all send me their ""thesetimes"" and then I have to look at each one and then figure out where the free time slots are. What it should be is that as a boss, I send one out to all the employees, they fill out their busy times, and then as the boss I can see all the total busy times of all my employees overlaid so I know when I can schedule the meeting. At least this is how I envision something like this being useful, not just simply sending one persons free/open times, but that is definitely a good use case also.<p>Some bugs:<p>- click and drag a time down, but while moving your cursor to the right of the actual day you clicked on, let go, then click and drag down again real quick. You made two times, but they are linked now for some reason. They also delete together.<p>- permalink is not working<p>- i can drag outside the borders<p>- some other real weird funky stuff going on with the dragging. probably have to clean up a buncha bugs in your jquery<p>Other nice to haves/things to consider:<p>- drag up<p>- a line that shows where your cursor is hovering over with the time tooltipped or something like that, it's all approximate right now<p>- i never liked the term permalink. i think just link works better. but this is just my personal opinion.<p>Good start though!

2499902,comment,2499456,2499869,4,0,T-R,,,"I'd say it's better - it's not more or less straightforward, both distributive and integrative approaches are still negotiations. You need to know your BATNA anyway, whether it's leaving or sucking it up, so doing more research just puts you in a better position, no matter which route you choose. Bluffing might get you lucky, but not likely as lucky as if you can back it up, and if they call your bluff, or it doesn't work out for some other reason, you'll have less bargaining power in the future.<p>It's also good to keep in mind that the best deal someone else got doesn't necessarily relate to the best deal you can get - just because someone negotiated a higher salary doesn't mean you can; it's not your BATNA unless someone makes you the offer. Also, if nothing else, distributive approaches tend to leave one or both parties feeling like they lost, which will likely sour future negotiations. Taking the integrative route means that the only losers are the companies that don't get you - assuming that's in their best interest (which it might not be, if they have a better BATNA than matching your BATNA).<p>Also, if the amount of effort and time that the negotiation takes is amongst your interests, then that's really on the negotiation table too (regardless of approach), it just means that you'll be negotiating away other things, like your salary, in order to satisfy that interest.",1304138474

2499884,comment,2497785,2498274,2,0,mkramlich,,,"> Microsoft spends a significant amount on basic research, like Bell labs used to and Microsoft research publishes a lot of publications.<p>I've always felt they spent so much on ""research"", in part, as a way to reduce their reported profits. Because Microsoft was notorious for mostly just copying what others did first (see Apple --- and yes I know about Xerox PARC), or acquiring/rebranding/integrating (Spyglass -> IE, etc.), and only a small percentage of so-called original/in-house stuff. When the original version of C# and .NET came out it was so hilariously obvious what they were ripping off at that time (<i>cough-Java-cough</i>), they didn't quite shave off all the boilerplate for those in the know. But They Capitalized Differently. Oooooh. ;)<p>On a related note, I once knew someone who officially worked in software R&D. And I noted they mostly spent a lot of time surfing the web and then parroting some sexy sounding thing they read about recently. Ironically (or not?) I think that's a not un-legitimate way, and certainly can be an effective way, to introduce new thinking inside a particular company, or introduce a new technology, like say as a pilot project. But to describe this process as requiring heavy spending (on software R&D mind you, not talking about hardware stuff) sounds ridiculous and an unnecessary money sink. Find a smart creative engineer. Take them off the leash. See where they go, what shiny nuggets they bring back. That's how you do practical software R&D, outside of academia. Doesn't require billions. Just brains, and it can be a side product of what your staff is already doing anyway -- if you have the right staff.",1304137580

Again, I could be completely off base here; I've just read some of the docs and talked to people who have worked with LLVM, not worked with it myself.  Please tell me if I'm wrong!<p>The problem with PNaCl is not that it's not widely ported enough ""yet"", but rather that there are no plans for a way to run it on platforms what PNaCl hasn't been ported to.  Compare this to JS, where you can get JS working on a new platform in fairly short order (e.g. by just compiling Spidermonkey, which is largely fairly portable C code and has a platform-independent interpreter).  Now your new platform won't have a JIT yet at that point, so performance may not be great, but at least you'll have a fighting chance at using the web.  You won't have that without a pretty large porting job if NaCl is in wide use.",1304136706

2739544,comment,2737645,2737645,2,0,pseale,,,"This sounds like how I helped my grandma with her Outlook/phone/digital photo woes. With some things (email) she was extremely successful; with others (digital photos, saving attached photos from emails) she remained lost forever.<p>She could have benefited from a dumbed-down interface for the things she struggled with. Picasa was as close as I could get as simple photo management, but she needed something even more seamless and simple.<p>It makes me wonder why there aren't more companies creating products like the Jitterbug ( <a href=""http://www.greatcall.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greatcall.com/</a> )--for those of you unaware, the Jitterbug is a cellphone with very large buttons and a presumably easy-to-navigate menu system, with concierge operator service for remedial support tasks (""I need to check my voicemail"").<p>Maybe we have tried making extremely simplified UIs for common computing tasks, and failed (Clippy/MS Bob)? Is there an extremely simple photo management app (or something on the Mac) that I'm unaware of?",1310061531

Incandescents have essentially the perfect black-body spectrum (the effects of the spectrum of tungsten are insignificant). This is what's called a CRI of 100. If you want a bulb with essentially a daylight look, you can get a halogen incandescent, and as a bonus, it's 30% more efficient. LEDs and CFLs don't come near this.<p>> The good thing about LEDs is that they're easy to tune; they're becoming very popular in the film world<p>The problem is that people can't tune the color filtering in each of their rooms with the expertise of a Hollywood cinematographer.<p>If you can test this product, great, but unfortunately, HN doesn't lend itself to this, since the thread will be long dead by the time you have results.

2739450,comment,2738294,2739139,2,0,weeny,,,"So the basic operating principle behind lighting LEDs is the correlation between light output and temperature.  As the LED heats up, its light output decreases.  If you want a single LED to produce more light, you have to pump more current through it - meaning more heat and a resulting higher temperature, shorter lifespan and reduced efficiency.  Thus, you have a tradeoff between more LEDs and lower current (higher cost and more efficient) and less LEDs and higher current (lower cost but less efficient).<p>Switch tries to give you the cake and feed it to you - they give you lots of LEDs, running at high current, and they manage the heat by immersing the LEDs in a liquid [liquid water has a conductivity and capacity for heat ~5x greater than aluminum even with a lower density].  But this has its own problems that you can probably imagine - not least of which is that the liquid probably absorbs more light than it gives back by removing heat.<p>Based on my ""in the know"" status, I can tell that Switch will be losing big bucks trying to sell those lights at $20 but they are working hard to cement themselves in the market early.  I'm very sceptical and look more towards smaller innovators like LEDNovation and LED Integration Technology.",1310060495

Because Java is imperative, it gives programmers slightly better control of their algorithms.  Most graphics programmers prefer to work low-level, at least in the core of their engine.  Python and similar languages are often integrated into script engines, but rarely used for the core of an engine.  I am suggesting Java because it allows programmers to work in at least a somewhat low-level style (the byte code is semi-predictable).\n6) It is pretty easy to get started and learn (not necessarily easy to master though).<p>I chose Clojure because it is Java-compatible, but Scala is probably just as good a choice.",1310059500

2739359,comment,2738294,2739031,14,0,yaakov34,,,"First, to settle the question about this particular lamp: I found some specs on their website, and they claim a CRI (color rendition index) of 65 for their ""neutral"" version and 85 for the ""warm"" version. This is poorer than most modern fluorescents (which people complain about), and the better CRI for the warm version is at the expense of making the light yellow, which many people also don't like. So we're not looking at the at the coming of the savior of efficient light bulbs.<p>For the question of the law, I agree that the savings in electricity are barely measurable, which is why I think it's theater. The huge growth in residential electricity use has been driven by increase in average home size, and by the explosion in the use of air conditioning. Also, it's not even clear that bulbs like this save energy over their lifetime. Sure, one of these theoretically replaces 20 incandescents and uses less electricity, but an incandescent light bulb is just a tiny tungsten wire + steel leads + glass + aluminium base + a drop of epoxy, all made in one factory with extraordinary efficiency that has been polished through 100 years of manufacturing. This thing has 20 LEDs + mounts + cooling tubes + cooling fins on the outside + ""non-toxic"" liquid + a bunch of electronics for control and dimming + enclosures and wiring for all of the above, made out of plastic and ceramic and glass. All manufactured in probably 20 factories and transported to be assembled in yet another place. If there is a win here for the environment, it's super-tiny.",1310059396

2739309,comment,2738294,2738726,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"<i>LEDs have a radically different spectrum from ""regular white light""</i><p>So do incandescents. The good thing about LEDs is that they're easy to tune; they're becoming very popular in the film world because you can make small fixtures that run a long time and that allow a cinematographer to dial in the desired color (via a multicolored array) instead of faffing around with sheets of colored gel, and they are capable of <i>much</i> better spectral power distribution than CFLs. It's not just the tinting and tunability of the LEDs themselves, but also the fact that they put out a steady light instead of CFLs' high-frequency flicker. Even when the color is slightly off from the ideal, the steady light source is much, much easier on the eyes.<p>I'm not ready to endorse these products yet, because their spec sheet just gives a single figure for color temperature. But I'm going to pick one up soon both because it looks cool and because the CFLs I have at home produce really ugly light, so it can hardly be worse. The first thing I'll be doing after ooh-ing and aah-ing over it's retro-modernist design is lining it up against other bulbs and shooting it against calibrated gray cards; I have the gear and skills to measure these things properly. If they're spectacularly good (or bad) I'll write it up.<p>EDIT: BTW LEDs can flicker too. It's probably more accurate to say fluorescent lights have a <i>low</i> frequency flicker since it's often slow enough to be easily seen by eye, especially if you use them with a dimmer switch - in which case the flicker is slow enough to interfere with film shutter speeds, CRTs and so on, giving rise to an unpleasant strobing look. I didn't mean to say that LEDs are completely immune from this, but I  have found them vastly easier to work with than fluorescents in a wide variety of situations.",1310058652

Dianne Feinstein that tows the lobby-line on PROTECT IP.<p>With all the recent state-legislation (e.g. tax implication on associates and requirements on payment providers) California is trying it's best to make it harder and harder for tech companies to setup and thrive here. So what would she have said to YouTube in the beginning?<p>Dear XXX:<p>I received your letter expressing your opposition to the ""Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act,"" commonly known as the ""PROTECT IP Act.""  I appreciate knowing your views on this matter.<p>America's copyright industry is an important economic engine, and I believe copyright owners should be able to prevent their works from being illegally duplicated and stolen.  The protection of intellectual property is particularly important to California's thriving film, music, and high-technology industries.<p>The ""PROTECT IP Act"" (S. 968) would give both copyright and trademark owners and the U.S. Department of Justice the authority to take action against websites that are ""dedicated to infringing activities.""  These are websites that have ""no significant use other than engaging in, enabling, or facilitating"" copyright infringement, the sale of goods with a counterfeit trademark, or the evasion of technological measures designed to protect against copying.  The bill would not violate Internet users' First Amendment right to free speech because copyright piracy is not speech.  On May 26, 2011, this legislation was reported favorably out of the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration by the full Senate.<p>I understand that you oppose the ""PROTECT IP Act.""  While I supported reporting the bill to the full Senate, please know that, prior to the close of the 111th Congress, I worked with California high-technology businesses and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) to improve upon language from previous versions of the bill and to address the concerns of legitimate high-tech businesses, public interest groups, and others.  However, I recognize that the bill needs further work to prevent it from imposing undue burdens on legitimate businesses and activities, and I will be working to make the improvements, either by working in cooperation with Chairman Leahy or by offering amendments on the floor of the Senate.  Please know I will keep your concerns and thoughts in mind should the full Senate consider the ""PROTECT IP Act.""<p>Once again, thank you for sharing your views.  I hope you will continue to keep me informed on issues of importance to you.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 224-3841.<p>Sincerely yours,<p><pre><code>  Dianne Feinstein\n          United States Senator</code></pre>",1310058430

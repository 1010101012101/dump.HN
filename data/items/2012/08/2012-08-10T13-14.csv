4366145,comment,4362146,4365804,1,0,3amOpsGuy,,,">> Sorry but then your monitoring system is broken? Why is its operation tied to log chunking?<p>Yours clearly bends some unbendable truths of the known universe ;-)<p>A monitoring system ordinarily samples the logfile at a given point in time, that is an open followed by a close operation on the logfile (lest you run into phantom disk usage issues caused by holding an open file handle to a compressed / rotated logfile).<p>If between sample 1 and sample 2 the log file is rolled, your monitoring system never sees the data between sample 1 and the end of the previous log.<p>Possible workarounds include logfile streaming (say via a pipe on the filesystem) but that introduces much larger problems and would in no way be compatible with the app rolling its log files.<p>A much simpler fix is to roll only on events (bounced the app etc.)<p>>> A script to identify the file-range for a given time-range via binary search is really easy to write<p>Contrast with no script required. No bugs, no maintenance time, no different versions in different regions. Just no script. The benefits don't stop there - when you need to query, there's no waiting for a bunch of disk seeks while the script runs against a busy disk controller - you can just get straight on with parsing the results.<p>>> Easier handling. If you need to offload ""50GB"" from a given log-host then that's easier to do when you know that will be 50 files.<p>Moving 50 items is easier than moving 1? I'm unconvinced but still open to any interesting ideas here.<p>>> You don't risk a scratch disk running full<p>There is no change to the risk profile, neither approach is better in this regard, unfortunately.<p>>> e.g. interleaved with stack traces<p>Just one of the many excellent reasons not to log them in production.<p>>> you must be well aware how long even the simplest merge-job takes on the slice of a single day?<p>Yes - it runs at full disk I/O speed with almost no CPU overhead. Remember we are merging sorted data (already in temporal order).<p>>> which happens frequently<p>It's clearly a high profile app you're working on (in my experience the people in charge of the pennies refuse to sign off on the cost of disk space for this amount of logging without solid reasoning) i'm surprised it behaves as badly as you say. Concerning, but then it also appears you don't have an ops team either.<p>>> stitch together context from other files.<p>I get the impression you're thinking that you should manually stitch these together? On the very rare occassions you need this data, remember both are already in time order, we just instantly merge on the fly.<p>>> A mere grep on a day's worth of logs takes about 10 minutes for us.<p>It sounds like you've got it all in one file, i.e. not splitting your audit.log out from your error.log from your trace.log? - techniques which I couldn't do without to be honest (the monitoring system would have to consume every byte logged otherwise, when it really only needs to see a subset of total log output - thus saving CPU time and disk seeks).<p>>> Any kind of text-processing or ""for each line perform lookup in $otherplace"" quickly pushes that into the hours.<p><i>shakes head</i><p>Would you humour me with some context here. What is your background? From your replies i would say you are non-ops staff[1], self-taught[2] and with limited experience[3].<p>[1] You don't demonstrate any knowledge of basic tools, e.g. you mentioned writing a script for a problem solved by a 35+ year old command found on any unix host<p>[2] You haven't volunteered anything more advanced than obvious / first order approaches. Approaches that i'd expect any CompSci university grad could suggest off the cuff with no prior experience.<p>[3] You mention grepping through a single logfile of at least 35Gb, likely much larger.",1344606953

4366123,comment,4360271,4360271,1,0,DisposableMike,,,"I have fond memories of ""hacking"" in high school. The school system I went to used Deep Freeze to protect their Win98 computers. You could format the hard drive, change all of the settings, etc, and upon reboot, the image would return, unchanged. Naturally, this led to deep investigation into how it worked. The system administrators weren't stupid but were severely undermanned, and had left the Deep Freeze program slightly vulnerable. A little command line work and you could remove the protection mechanism for the given session, allowing you to persist changes. So, I did things like edit the shell in HEX and change ""START"" button to say ""FARTS"", lame things like that. The suspense was that supposedly the maker of the software would fly anyone who could crack their system out to New York to demonstrate. Despite finding the above hole, I was never able to totally eradicate the software, and could persist only certain changes (changing the startup image, playing funny .WAV files on boot, etc).<p>My biggest mistake was sharing this knowledge with my classmate, who used it to do a great many annoying and potentially harmful things. After doing things like sending ""I 0wn j00!"" to 11,000 computers on the network (via NET SEND), crashing the shared network drive with millions of blank text files, etc, he finally got caught after badly damaging 3 of the computers in our lab using my hack method that I'd written a batch file to accomplish and given him the disk.<p>I was called to the computer lab by my awesome programming teacher, who informed me that he had to leave the building in 45 minutes, and if the computers weren't back to their proper state by then, we'd both probably be suspended. The other kid just sat there, while I furiously reversed the changes and got out with a few minutes to spare.<p>Naturally, the next year, him and a couple of my other classmates were suspended or expelled for repeatedly crashing the entire 11,000 network with advancements on my initial script. I was thankful that there was apparently no ties left to me in the program's execution, but that was warning enough to focus on productive things for the remainder of my high school career.",1344606749

There is disagreement among neuroscientists whether intelligence is a result of brain modularity (specific regions of the brains optimized for certain tasks), or due to brain size alone. All that said, I'm skeptical of the singularity since it assumes that a recursive process can continually improve intelligence without significant diminishing returns. The problem with this thinking is that it fails to take into account evolution. All this research into AI is based on the assumption that ""intelligence"" should be like human intelligence. But human intelligence has had several billion years to evolve and is highly optimized for our environment (actually our environment from several tens of thousands of years ago when we were hunter gatherers). It seems naive to me to assume that we are not nearing a local optimum in what is possible with human intelligence.

4366010,comment,4365255,4365255,8,0,parasubvert,,,"This doesn't actually seem to be all that new of an argument: the debate used to be about ""craft"" vs. ""engineering"" or between ""software is math"" and ""software is mechanism"".<p>For example of what's pretty close to a Yegge rant of the 1980's, see Edsger Dijkstra, ""On the cruelty of really teaching computing science"" [1].   It seems to be bemoaning similar debates in the software field, though from a very ""conservative"" perspective, since Dijkstra prefers that a formal proof should be required with every program, and one should completely avoid anthropomorphism in discussing software design.<p>Another thought that's crossed my mind:   one of the reasons for the evolution of these approaches to politics and risk over the years has to do with the scale of impact.   Liberally messing around with a social and economic systems can lead to widespread human disaster:  China's Great Leap Forward comes to mind.    How the software is used and how reliable it needs to be is an engineering tradeoff with regards to cost & time.   This is often why you tend to see much more liberal approaches to software in smaller companies - the scale of impact is much smaller (in terms of customer base, and investment) when you cock up.<p>Now, it's clear that larger companies, particularly many IT shops, could learn a thing or two about being ""progressive conservatives"", as they've ""conserved"" for far too long and are caught in the trap of special interests (i.e. traditional vendors dependent on their cash).   Fear of dynamic languages, open source, or cloud services, or non-waterfall development is mostly a reactionary ideology grounded with some kernels of truth - static typing DOES help codebases scale (but you shouldn't be proud of a large codebase), you can't just pick ANY open source library as some are DOA,  or ANY cloud as some are unreliable, and tinkering with your delivery methodology can reduce your performance greatly due to confusion, plus there's plenty of cargo-cult agile consultants waiting to rope you in.   So, you need to think these things through.   But that's not an excuse for avoidance.  Perhaps that means I'm a software moderate.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036...</a><p>(edit: typo)",1344604983

However, a human operator is not like a gantry-style CNC router, they cannot simply ""fly"" over the work area. Typically, must operate the router in a ""push and pull"" fashion to maintain control.  A human would become weary very quickly if you put them in a harness over a 50-ft piece of material and forced them to push and pull with their arms hanging below them.  Finding motors with enough torque, but not so much to put the human in danger (you wouldn't want a software flaw to push the router in a dangerous direction without the operator being able to override it with their own physical strength) will limit what bits and materials the process can be used on.

It is hard to understand from a western perspective how such a diverse nation can survive without anything common except religion. However there is a strong sense of unity (despite clashes) among Indians. E.g. legendary boxer Mary Kom still wants to win a gold medal form India despite the atrocities of Indian government has committed on her region. I feel the people know that in order to prosper they've to be together as a nation. An independent Chhattisgarh nation will be ineffective.<p>The Southern and Western states are way ahead of Northern states in terms of progress but Bihar has shown that it can have good governance and make economic strides.<p>The main issue is the media which wants to portray India as an alternative to China and the ruling class who think it's possible. India is an elephant; slow, messy and taking its own course on its own terms.

10324313,comment,10323506,10323902,0,0,mindslight,,,"At least in the US, electrical energy is generally measured in kWh. Joules would be annoying to the reader, even though it&#x27;s simpler.<p>I think the constant confusion just comes about from journalists trying to write emotionally compelling articles. Saying that all 5 days recouped enough energy to power a single home for a year sounds pretty unimpressive. So the interviewee extrapolates out to if the system ran for the whole year or otherwise were scaled up. But having no technical background (and thus little respect for technical details), the writer edits their phrasing to be much simpler. Treating &quot;power&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; as synonyms, we end up with gross misstatements like in the article.<p>(And then of course the fact that such gross inaccuracies get past the <i>editors</i> and actually published shows you just how detail oriented the modern news org actually is. Just think of that any time you read any thing!)",1443887943

Due to clock skew, the server could think it is several seconds (or even minutes) earlier or later than your clock does. The server doesn&#x27;t broadcast what it thinks the current time is, either. One way to actually figure out the current time is through the random seed! Start a game on the server, noting the current time on your clock. Then generate NetHack games for that time, that time plus a second, that time minus a second, plus two seconds, and so on until you get the same starting map and stats. The offset you used is the number seconds between your machine and the server, so you can use it to know exactly when to start a server game.

As a result, you can only make it accessible to the middle-class by subsidies... but someone has to pay these subsidies. Not everyone can be a winner in the game of taxes and subsidies. So if you want to make that lifestyle more affordable, you are inherently saying that you are ready to make every other lifestyle LESS affordable by taxing them to provide the subsidies required to support your favored lifestyle.<p>Even if you manage to get everyone into that lifestyle, you have moved a large part of the funding that goes into it from an optional price that people may or may not pay into a fixed price that everyone has to pay. In other words, just because someone chooses to opt out of that lifestyle doesn&#x27;t free him from having to pay the cost associated to it.<p>For example, let&#x27;s look at plane tickets. Everyone wishes they could afford first class, but they can&#x27;t. What would happen if governments decided to reduce the cost of first class tickets to make them more accessible? Well, a lot more people would opt for first class, and airlines would convert more and more of the plane to first class, which would only increase perpetually the amount of subsidies required to make first class more affordable. People who opt for economy class in the meanwhile wouldn&#x27;t have access to these subsidies and would pay the full price of their tickets... AND pay the same taxes as people who buy first class tickets. So they pay taxes that reduce their purchasing power to subsidize first class ticket buyers, subsidies they can only access if they themselves opt for first class. Is this really a fair situation? That&#x27;s basically what most of North America has been doing for 70 years.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to subsidies on principle, but I think subsidies need to fulfill social objectives that help society or make it more humane. How is subsidizing lifestyle choices that incur more costs, more waste and more pollution, to society helping to fulfill social objectives? If people want that lifestyle, fine, as long as they pay for it.",1443885744

We just need RFC #1245 to get implemented (it has been accepted), and for someone to mark the size_of intrinsic as a const fn. However this might get into the weeds pretty bad since &quot;size&quot; is handled by trans (LLVM even). Dunno those details.<p>* Shared mutability of hardware registers should be able to be soundly handled by Cell.<p>This leaves the big issue:<p>The kernel has been architected as a single &quot;main&quot; thread, and a bunch of interrupt handling threads. All the interrupt-handling threads do is enqueue a message for the main thread to handle. The main thread then drives all the drivers off of this queue, so they all run on one thread. However they want to do some shared mutable stuff. In particular, I think they want closures that close over the same value mutably? RefCell isn&#x27;t particularly acceptable because crashing is Super Bad, and they would like to avoid runtime checks anyway. They just found out about Cell, so it might work, but they seem to think this wouldn&#x27;t be right.<p>You can make Cells pretty fine-grained. You can also consider /u/SimonSapin&#x27;s proposed extension to Cell which has a replace method for non-Copy types so you could replace (say) an arbitrary Cell<Option<T>> with None temporarily through a shared reference.<p>Alternatively, it might be possible to manually thread the shared mutable state since it&#x27;s all being driven by some top-level event-loop (as far as I can tell).

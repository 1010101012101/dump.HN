I am not sure if it's ok with object code.<p>Have a look at the ICQ patent and other known patented software, to see how claims should be written.<p>Applying on your own online at uspto.gov or epo.org could really cost you not much.<p>Or try legalzoom.com. <p>A lawyer will be helpful if you don't know how to write your own claims.<p>*update<p>If the software is an early version you should consider filling a provisional patent, which costs less. This would give you 1 year to perfect it. Though you should be careful because if your description in the provisional is out of scope and doesn't match with the patent application it would not server any purpose.",1193454269

I remember being extremely impressed with her and Aaron during the interview and the idea seemed quite plausible at the time (even though it later failed). I also remember personally being really excited about the sister/brother team.<p>During the time Adora was at YC, we got to know her well and were even more impressed, which is why Paul invested personally when she said she had no money left.<p>Startups are hard.

8090910,comment,8090580,8090580,17,0,jdswain,,,"Java 1.0 and 1.1 were mainly targeted at browser applets. Applets were maybe a bit before their time as the download speed was slow and there were issues with downloading the JVM. The JVM was a really big download for the time, with many users still on dialup or maybe slow DSL. You could never rely on which particular JVM the user had, and this was a cause of compatibility problems. At the time windows was almost completely dominant as an end user operating system. And as others have said Microsoft&#x27;s embrace, extend, extinguish didn&#x27;t help. Microsoft came out with a relatively decent IDE for java, but then started pushing a technology I think they called J/Direct that let you make windows system calls directly from Java, which was kind of useful, but also completely tied you in to windows.<p>The enterprise/server usage of Java really took off with JDK 1.2, AKA Java 2 Enterprise Edition. Sun and also IBM put a lot of effort into promoting this version of Java. It coincided with the dot-com boom, every company suddenly needed web applications, and Java was the best way to build them. All the popular programming books from O&#x27;Reilly and others were about various Java related technologies, and I guess all the good jobs were working in Java. IBM did a &#x27;World Tour&#x27; promoting Java and even produced/produces their own Java runtime (based on Sun&#x27;s version).<p>Windows was the standard desktop operating system in corporates, and it was a real advantage that developers could develop locally on windows and then deploy on a Sun/IBM/HP server.<p>Java application servers became a thing. Sun bought NetDynamics, one of the first application servers. Basically an application server gave you all the needed structure and plumbing to build your enterprise application, whereas often in earlier projects developers built this all from scratch.<p>Java was designed to make code reuse easier, libraries could be packaged into jars and due to the language&#x27;s consistency it was easier to combine code from others than it is in languages like C/C++. A lot of the tools you needed to build internet apps were built first (or only) for Java. Things like crypto libraries, SOAP tools, XML, XSLT, all the new stuff at the time.<p>UML became a popular standard for design documentation at the same time too, and java was well suited to building UML based designs. UML came about by merging many of the leading OO design methodologies of the time to create one overall standard. It combined the methodologies of many of the leading OO proponents of the time, including Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh. There were a number of good UML tools, starting with Rational Rose (purchased by IBM) that really suited designing enterprise systems and then realising them in Java. Java was useful here because of its consistent object-orientedness.<p>It was also accepted wisdom at the time that you could hire a team of average developers and they could produce decent Java code, you couldn&#x27;t rely on the same result from C++ where there were many more ways to shoot yourself in the foot. It also helped that at the same time there were huge numbers of Indian developers entering the job market at reasonable pay rates.<p>Java quickly became the standard, using anything else was either risky due to lack of support, didn&#x27;t have the libraries or tool support, or maybe didn&#x27;t have a large enough base of skilled developers available. So Java was the safe choice.",1406411337

And it tapped into some trendy / buzzwordy things at just the right time.<p>On the first point:<p>1. binary object compatibility. This was <i>huge</i> in a day when C++ and most other &quot;cross platform&quot; languages required you to ship libraries as source code, which bloated your code base and slowed down your compile times even further.  Java nailed &quot;library driven development&quot; at a time when people were hungry for that.<p>2. Threading.  Java&#x27;s threading model is far from perfect, but it made using threads far more accessible, especially in a cross platform way, than what was previously possible in languages like C++ - <i>especially while staying within the bounds of the language / standard library itself</i>.<p>3. Garbage Collection - has it&#x27;s pluses and minuses like everything, but a lot of C++ people who were tired of goofing around with manual memory management really embraced Java and it&#x27;s simpler approach.<p>On point two above:<p>1. &quot;Internet&quot; programming. Java had good support for sockets and even basic HTTP stuff early on, and always seemed to do a decent to better-than-average job of supporting network programming (with a couple of glaring exceptions, like raw sockets)<p>2. &quot;mobile code&quot; - most people never wound up doing much with this, but it was trendy in the late 90&#x27;s, early 2000&#x27;s and Java was seen as a good platform for doing this stuff.<p>And probably some other stuff I&#x27;m forgetting.  All in all, Java just did a nice job of hitting a good &quot;sweet spot&quot; at a good time and place.  And that sweet spot was sweet enough to make it compelling, despite its warts.",1406410196

The problem isn&#x27;t Emacs, but rather everything else.<p>To expand on that point: what I&#x27;m complaining about is the fact that OS X, and native apps, use the Command key, which is where Alt would be on a PC keyboard, as the meta key for shortcuts which on a Windows or Linux box are bound to Control. This is a terrible idea from a UX perspective in general, because every common keybinding requires a hand cramp to invoke. From the special perspective of someone who remaps Caps Lock to Control, it&#x27;s even worse.<p>I&#x27;m probably going to end up remapping Caps Lock to Command instead, and reconfiguring Emacs and iTerm accordingly; it looks like that&#x27;ll work out to be a pretty complete solution to the problem.

They&#x27;re about ergonomics. The erratic variations in letter footprints and the up-and-down-and-up from the ascender line to the x-height and back affect reading speed. It&#x27;s also spurious; the capitalization style in your example doesn&#x27;t add additional information.<p>Try giving some thought to capitalization along those lines. Does capitalization add information that otherwise isn&#x27;t explicit? How does it affect reading speed?<p>The anwers are roughly &quot;yes, sometimes&quot; and &quot;yes, sometimes&quot; (the latter depends a lot on how you define &quot;reading speed/performance&quot;; &quot;reading&quot; decomposes into a set of different types of interacting with text, like searching, information/keyword retention, etc). You can call this a good case for capitalization, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s a given, and competing writing systems do get by well without it.<p>> We have rules and standards so everyone can understand them.<p>Sorta. &quot;Understand&quot; is a big topic to broach, see above. It&#x27;s of course true that shared language and shared orthography enable sophisticated communication and grease its wheels. And in that light, not conforming may suggest an exclusionary attitude (just like e.g. excessive use of jargon can be motivated by tribalism). But it&#x27;s not where I&#x27;d personally draw the line; I&#x27;d read a text rather than dismiss it beforehand based solely on a lack of capital letters.<p>> If you can&#x27;t do that effectively, then you have failed in your communication.<p>The many other comments discussing the actual information content of the text seem to suggest that it hasn&#x27;t.",1406409821

8090803,comment,8089690,8090167,2,0,dannypgh,,,"Your concept of hatred here is what I would describe as self defense. I draw a distinction between racial prejudice - that is, prejudging people based on their race - and racism - which I understand as a social-political-economic system of institutionalized racial oppression.<p>Racial prejudice is an order of magnitude less interesting to me than racial oppression.  I am a person of color and I know that people see me and think all sorts of things about me because of things beyond my control; this bothers me, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as the fact that I&#x27;ve been physically attacked and harassed for walking around my own neighborhood, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as the fact that I know that I and many of my loved ones will, even holding all else equal, have worse outcomes with job interviews, police, and law enforcement because of our race.  To me that&#x27;s real racism, and it&#x27;s not something that white people can experience in our society.<p>Stamping out racial prejudice is a worthwhile goal, but in my opinion it&#x27;s an order of magnitude less important than ending racist systems.  The focus on racial prejudice is likely to create lots of bad analysis (e.g. people who aspire to make the world &quot;colorblind&quot;) from otherwise well-intentioned people, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s tactically sound to focus on prejudice. I also do not believe there is any moral standing to criticize survivors of racism for having prejudicial feelings towards white people.  It is a response.  People build these walls because they&#x27;re tired of getting hurt.<p>I have tactical objections and moral concerns with many things concerning the NOI but I do not judge people for their involvement or promotion of it, for as long as it&#x27;s motivated by a desire for self-liberation. I&#x27;m not sure what the &quot;atrocious stuff&quot; you&#x27;re worried about from his past is, but nothing I know from his past I consider as &quot;evil&quot; that I have to &quot;ignore.&quot;  The coffee and creamer allegory, etc. simply don&#x27;t bother me, because I understand them in historical context.",1406408990

They don&#x27;t really care how the problems are pointed out, as their interest is in getting the problems fixed, and not taking it personally.<p>These people are very different from, say, the young Rubyist who will have his feelings hurt when legitimate flaws are pointed out with something he&#x27;s worked on. The GCC developers won&#x27;t cry if you report a bug, and they won&#x27;t deny that it exists to try to save face.

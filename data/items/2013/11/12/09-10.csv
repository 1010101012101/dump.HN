Maybe not their existence, but how they could be used to 1-up every other HFT algo that wasn&#x27;t in on this trick.<p>The video isn&#x27;t only interesting because of Haim Bodek&#x27;s allegations by the way, there&#x27;s quite a few fairly high-profile people (formerly) active in the HFT world commenting on how markets are effectively broken and unstable because of opaque HFT algorithms, stock exchanges actively promoting HFT to drive up the volume of trades (and hence their profits), and regulators not really doing anything to reduce the risk of flash crashes or penalize parties that completely break the market every once in a while.",1384250374
6716825,comment,6716348,6716476,21,0,phyalow,,,"I enjoy reading your comments.<p>I have read Patterson&#x27;s book which scratches the surface in &quot;Dark Pools&quot;, Haim&#x27;s book &quot;The problem of HFT&quot; and his regular pieces on Zerohedge. I cannot help but feel that Bodek has an ulterior motive &quot;for exposing the system&quot;... I don&#x27;t buy his narrative largely because all this so called adverse behaviour is widely described in literature especially in exchange/venue published documentation, support and educational material.<p>A prime example is on page 93 of his book [5] which is a scalping scenario based on inter-market sweep orders (he attributes to a significant loss of capital at Trading Machines) to this strategy... Come on Haim really? you never considered the adverse affects of placing vanilla limit orders? The books [1], [2] and [4] touch on these exact scenarios.<p>I don&#x27;t buy for a second that he couldn&#x27;t have picked up a phone and called his account manager/support technician at X venue, or his broker to ask why he was getting an abysmally low rate of fills, or seek colour on orderbook oddities. Despite his lofty background it appears he was out of his depth at &quot;trading machines&quot; and now is attempting to sell his ideas to anyone that will listen. I do commend him though on shedding light over the field and on getting me interested in HFT/execution.<p>For anyone interested in learning more, some books I would recommend:<p>[1] Dark Pools - Erik Banks (2010).<p>[2] Empirical Market Microstructure - Joel Hasbrock (2007).<p>[3] Dark Pools - Scott Patterson (2012).<p>[4] HFT - Irene Alridge (2010).<p>Also if anyone is interested here is Haim Bodek&#x27;s recently self-published book: [5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Problem-HFT-Collected-Frequency-Structure-ebook/dp/B00B1UDSS4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Problem-HFT-Collected-Frequency-Struct...</a>",1384250365

A browser is the platform, the runtime if you will, that lets us build applications on the internet.<p>The first browser was pretty much good at nothing but rendering bits of text, shortly followed by images, and it grew from there.<p>Today browsers have a myriad of capabilities that make exciting applications on the internet possible, such as: CSS transitions, CSS animations, CSS gradients, CSS calc, html5, WebGL, Web Audio Data, media streaming data, video elements, audio elements, binary data handling, object URLs, zip URLs, binary data requesting, cross origin resources sharing, WebSockets, WebRTC, realtime video/audio capture/encoding/transmission/decoding/playback, and so forth.<p>This are features of the &quot;browser engine implementation&quot;. And not all browsers implement the same features. For instance take iOS safari which lacked the CSS capability for position:fixed and usable overflow:scroll handling until just about a year ago. All browsers in 1997 already implemented this flawlessly, and correctly. But for whatever reason, Apple didn&#x27;t until more than a decade after the inception of that feature.<p>Similarly other features aren&#x27;t implemented, too numerous to list, save for the one that annoys me personally most, that is WebGL.<p>A similar situation was evident on the desktop internet in the time period between 1998 and 2004, where Internet Explorer 6 ruled supreme. But other browsers (chiefly Firefox) offered a different implementation, and hence put Microsoft under pressure to improve internet explorer if they wish to stay relevant.<p>The same kind of pressure cannot be exerted on Apples iOS browser, because you&#x27;re forbidden from exercising it. This is bad for the Web, it&#x27;s bad for me and it&#x27;s bad for you.<p>Unsurmountable barriers to competition are always bad for everybody, except the one building the barrier.",1384250254

It&#x27;s long and really needs editing, but I hope it gets my thoughts across. I think the part about OOP is also misguided, but it&#x27;s so obviously tacked on to a rant about functional programming that I just ignored it.<p>Haskells purity is not about getting rid of side-effects but about <i>controlling</i> side-effects. Its making side-effects <i>first-class citizens</i>: now you can write code that talks about having or not having them!<p>You can still have side-effects however you want, you just have to be explicit about it. To some extent, the fact that this uses monads is incidental: all thats important is that there is <i>some</i> IO type, <i>some</i> ST type and so onthe fact that they all form monads is almost an implementation detail. Thats why some of the most exciting Haskell featuresSTM, the IO manager and so onare all about effects. Clearly, Haskell more than acknowledges effects, so the entire diatribe about ignoring the existence of side-effects is attacking a straw man.<p>Besides, you cant simply replace a first-class system for managing effects with static analysis, without essentially reproducing the same restrictions. How would you do something like Haskells deterministic parallelism model or reliable STM or the very aggressive loop fusion (and general rewriting) Haskell uses? Theres a reason you dont see these things done nearly as well in any other languages: all of these fall apart as soon as you introduce side-effects, so you need some way to help the programmer ensure things like this are only used safely.<p>And this is exactly how types like IO and ST help make code safer. Sure, <i>within</i> an ST block, you have stateful code thats just as hard to analyze. But you can guarantee that this does not leak outside the block. Similarly, functions can rely on their inputs not doing anything untoward however theyre used. This allows you to explicitly state the assumptions about your inputs: how is this a bad thing? In turn, this makes writing code that takes advantage of these properties much easier: you can ask that your inputs do not cause side-effects in a way thats self-documenting and easy to verify. Then youre free to re-evaluate your inputs or call functions however many times you want, as concurrently as you want. At the extreme, this can even be used for security purposes: see Safe Haskell.<p>Sure you can write pure functions in any language. And you can write side-effecting procedures in Haskell too. But the difference is that Haskell lets you be explicit about whether you want side-effects or notits just another part of your interface. And this is how types like IO and ST help make your code easier to think about: any code that is <i>not</i> in a type like IO or ST can only depend on its arguments, making all the dependencies more explicit. (Note, again, how this is all independent of monadsits all about effects, and the types just happen to form monads.) This does not make static analysis too much easier, but that was never the pointthe goal is to make the code easier to think about, and knowing that there are no hidden state dependencies certainly does that. A static analyzer can follow data flow easily, but it requires quite a bit of thinking for the programmer to do the same!<p>The core motivation for managing effects  la Haskell is not mathematical purity: its software engineering. We want code that is easier to think about, has better guarantees and is more modular. The goal is to make code less complex by removing hidden dependencies between distant parts of your program (mutable state) and the effect of evaluation on the meaning of your program (side-effects in general). You can refactor and move around most Haskell code without worrying about breaking its surroundings because any dependencies are explicit. You can extract something into a function, consolidate multiple function calls into one or split one into multiple and generally change your code up quite a bit without worrythese actions cannot change the codes correctness because effects are managed for you.<p>Ultimately, functional programming like Haskell is not just normal programming with side-effects outlawed. Instead, its a different <i>basis</i> for programming which allows you to manage side-effects explicitly. In this light, papers like solved problem but with monads are entirely reasonable: theyre about bringing things over to this new basis. And this goes the other way too: theres a reason why you dont see good STM, deterministic parallelism, stream fusion (and rewrite-rule optimizations in general), anything like DPH and anything like Safe Haskell in other languages.",1384249598

It might be true that the school tries to learn from the West in terms of marketing and communications. I might agree that the talent of the East is still more on the engine while the West is better at chassis. It might also be true that the average MIT student rather enjoys being defined as a product magician solving a complex problem than a salesman wo re-invents the way how the product is packaged and communicated (both deserves its credit). However, the focus is merely on the product solution where thinking about the end-consumer often flows in a little later, sometimes too late.

I was a &#x27;rusty spoon&#x27; for using resilient SQL. Funny how even engineers, a whole industry, can get swept up in using a subpar data store because it&#x27;s the new cool piece of tech that makes it easier to have json you throw to a wall stick. I will never feel shamed again for not using some hot shot popular offering only because it makes development a tad bit easier.

But:\nFor &quot;big banks&quot; (whatever this may mean in your perspective), it may be somewhat problematic to support companies on a level beyond a regular bank account, because if you need regulatory consulting, this is something that doesn&#x27;t work straight-through - instead, it involves a lot of tailormade solutions (and country by country, in the worst case)<p>#2:\nIf you do a business, that a bank can&#x27;t judge, the bank is free to deny support. Classic business, a standard banks understands it. But Bitcoin? Since this is new, and since no body has real(!) experience with it, they do not know how to evaluate. Plus: If the police/government/regulatory-authority finds out that you are supporting a big money-laundering-factory (by giving a bank account to them), there are people at the bank who may be put in jail, just because they didn&#x27;t understand/didn&#x27;t know. (And if you are not specialized in those new things, and if you have no experience with this new phenomena, its very likely that you do not understand whats going on! People in good-&#x27;ol corporate banking come from a completely different background, so they <i>can&#x27;t</i> have the experience)\nAnd thats the rub: Instead of complaining why someone doesn&#x27;t get a bank account, try to imagine -for a second- if anybody of you would be in that position - and i guess, no one of you would take the risk, right? :-)\nSo, the most simple thing is just to deny the application for a bank account, instead of spending hours and hours of investigating and jumping into the materia...<p>#3:\nThe above mentioned #2 is evebn more important, if you consider how many requests you get from people interested in running/starting a Bitcoin-whatever-business:\nSince market is new, there is a gold rush, barriers are low (at least it seems like to most people), and every kid today thinks of running an exchange is that easy. In fact it is not. (and i confirm this to you since i do have a lof background/insider informations). \nSo, imagine the position of the bank:\n- You do not have the people & experience yet\n- You get tons of requests from startups, most of them will never survive\n- If there is a business opportunity for your company, you just don&#x27;t know - but you have to invest a lot of money(!) to get something on the road\nNow the magical question:\nWHAT do you do? :-))<p>#4:\nFor most Bitcoin businesses out there, its not that you just need a simple bank account; if you want to operate in the current scenario, you need a lot more, depending on the country and the opinion of the regulatory authority. This involves a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of uncertainty etc.\n(By the way: If you want to exchange money, you need a license - but in Bitcoins, everyone thinks having no regulation is good? Maybe you wanna think about that twice)\nAnd since all of these costs, most banks just say no, because its the easier and more efficient answer.<p>#5:\nHere is now the conspiracy-theory part: \nWhy, ever, should any bank deny a startup because it works with Bitcoins? Its just a too simple thought, because every bank is interested in doing & expanding business, so why would they have a interested in shuting-down you just because you use a new currency?\nMost people think, banks do not support it currently, because its a new currency which will attack &quot;the power structure&quot; of the current monetary system (which is, obviously, somewhat flawed and i can tell you this because i&#x27;m working in this sector ;-)\nBut maybe you wanna read #6.<p>#6:\nBiggest problem is to think, that even if Bitcoin will rule the world tomorrow, that there are no more banks. Even at T(0) after Bitcoin has taken over the world, there will be &quot;banks&quot; - maybe not what you think a bank is today, but even then there will be banks. Why? Its just not practical for your parents in their 50&#x27;s to carry around a USB stick with all their assets on it. Its just a dumb idea. And even if the todays digital natives have reached their 50&#x27;s, and even if they are &quot;native with Bitcoin&quot;, also then its a very very bad idea to have all you assets in your pocket or at your apparment.<p>No comes the advertorial of my post ;-)\nSince Fidor Bank is a very young bank, we are able to support those types of business and we are proud to work with our partners www.bitcoin.de and www.kraken.com in the area of Bitcoin exchanges. We do this, because we think that the financial sector needs innovation and disruption. And yes, even if we are a bank (see #6 above), we do not belive that banks will be passed away. We have an optimistic approach on that.<p>Regards from Munich,<p>Florian",1384247395

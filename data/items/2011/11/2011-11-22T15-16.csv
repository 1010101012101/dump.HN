From what I see it seems great.  There is even a Rails-knockout plugin to help bind the knockout objects to Rails models. I am excited about it.  I think the binding of data to HTML elements is a perfect fit and natural extension of HTML. I briefly looked at backbone, but it seems very limited in the user experience portion of the puzzle.",1321977506

The set of accidents includes accidents caused by factors other than lack of training or lack of attention. Poor weather conditions, drunk drivers, falling asleep at the wheel; these aren't things that licensing fewer people to drive will solve, not to mention that simply refusing to issue a license doesn't ensure that the person won't drive.<p>It's an overly simplistic solution presented in a superior tone that does not solve the stated problem.",1321976018

Depression is very common and strikes everywhere.<p>On the other hand, startup culture does make it unusually difficult to cope with depression. There's a cult of very long hours and complete focus on work, which is a recipe for burnout. Most startups need every employee to be a marketing face of the company  which generally involves a constant projection of optimism and energy, and which in the era of Twitter can require you to keep your game face on 24/7.<p>Speaking of Twitter: Software startups are the first and most energetic adopters of the internet, the social structure of the internet is not (yet?) well designed  it is still early in its history  and frankly the internet is not an emotionally healthy environment. It's a fishbowl the size of the planet.  There are all kinds of things that none of us are comfortable discussing in public, mental health is right there on the top of that list (in American culture, at any rate), and there is nothing more public than the internet.<p>University is a far less scary environment. There's rituals and schedules. There is, believe it or not, less time pressure. There are lots of peers who are easy to interact with <i>in person</i>. There's restaurants and bars and student unions and clubs and sports and hobbies. There's professional counseling. There's bailout options (you can drop classes, petition for pass/fail status, take leaves of absence). Most important of all, there's less of the culture of relentless optimism. People <i>expect</i> students to get into funks now and then. Everyone knows that sophomores spend hours having crazy philosophical discussions at three in the morning. The Ph.D. is practically <i>basic training</i> in depression-management techniques.

And as we bend them, we adapt to the new general rule.<p>We are all familiar with the english teacher's common correction of a misplaced object: ""It's 'He and I went to the store', not 'Me and him went to the store'"". This ""rule"" has been so often repeated, that most days I hear college-educated individuals perform the inverse, substituting the nominative for the objective case, as in ""Bob critiqued the web page with Jack and I."" What is interesting to me is apparently the act of replacing the nominative with the objective also occured in the Latin language around 200 AD (and it's a common act in children). So, if we create our rules for grammar empirically and not not arbitrarily, we can look at saying ""Me and Jack did something"" as acceptable because it has a natural precedent.<p>Which is all just to say that communication as a web form or in paragraphs is subjective and organic.

Do listen to those who actually tried it however (Jd for instance says that using it with a mouse is a pain).<p>Another keyboard that looks very promising is <a href=""http://trulyergonomic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trulyergonomic.com/</a> (not out yet, and they brag far too much for my taste, but nevertheless looks promising: flat (easier with the mouse), split, straight, and with mechanical keys).<p>Now, about the keyboards I personally experienced: the cheap default keyboard is the worst by a relatively wide margin.  I tried the MS 4000, and the split design makes things much better.  Then I stumbled upon <a href=""http://typematrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://typematrix.com/</a>.  It is flat, but the straight design more than makes up for it.  I like it much better than my MS 4000.  I recommend you use a palm rest however: without it, your wrists can bend significantly backwards, defeating the purpose of an ergonomic keyboard.<p>Note that I speak under the assumption that we all touch type.  If you don't, you should start.  It gives a <i>huge</i> boost in comfort.  It also helps ease neck and eye strain, as you don't need to repeatedly glance down at your keyboard.  Finally, without touch typing, ergonomic keyboards are much less useful.  I also recommend that you learn a Dvorak layout, or equivalent for your language (note that even though Dvorak is optimized for English, it helps many other languages as well, due to similarities in the frequencies of letters).  I found the gain in comfort noticeable, though less great than touch typing.  It also took me some time to learn (expect 1-4 weeks of greatly diminished typing speed).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/better-keyboards"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loup-vaillant.fr/articles/better-keyboards</a>",1321975035

That's what people think, but the processing is trivial. The hard parts are the mechanical grip and the control theory that lets you know exactly where you are, where you're pointed, and how fast you're going.  My experience of building and running one of these things is that computing the exploration, solving the maze, and computing the fastest path (which isn't always the shortest[1]), is all a complete doddle compared with coping with wheel slip, bumps in the surface, and precise control of the speeds of the wheels.  Granted, my mouse never ran at that speed, but I had an 8 bit 4MHz processor and it was mostly idle.<p>[1] A longer route can be faster if it has fewer corners.  I was at the competition where a mouse first ran a diagonal, and thereafter the designs of all the mazes changed to account for this.",1321975016

This includes not shelling out to bash unless you really really really can't achieve the same thing with a bit of more code. Apart from making the app less portable, more bug prone, less maintainable etc, it's just ugly.",1321974275

Your mileage may vary, but I found the MS 4000 to be just about the same level of comfort as a standard keyboard. It didn't really offer anything more than having a bit of a split in it. The vertical mouse seemed to help on days when I was using the mouse a lot, but on days with lots of typing, I was still getting pain.<p>I decided to bite the bullet and get the more expensive Kinesis Advantage. After getting used to it, my pain went away, so I'd say it was worth the extra cost. Maybe it's just the sunk cost of relearning to type on a weird shaped keyboard makes me want to feel like the time was worth it - but I suppose it doesn't matter as long as the pain is gone. Also, it's just really cool looking which is good for nerd cred in the office. :D",1321974265

You can go to Maine, Minnesotta or somewhere that there is a large amount of snow for a long period of time. You can drive the Blue Ridge Parkway, or rip through canyons in the southwest. You can go to NYC, or stick to superslab/highway roads.<p>Yet any 16 year old that shows they can drive around suburban streets and get 80% of the questions right on a test can go absolutely anywhere, and hold that license until they die or a court revokes it.<p>An idea just popped in my head that perhaps roads (like ski trails) could have different difficulty color codes, and that you had to be licensed to drive on each type. This is likely too much complexity, but still a neat idea.<p>Public transit I feel (and perhaps I'm wrong on this) actually was something that many cities had in the US and were planning before every 3 person family had 4 cars. Here in Columbus, Ohio, we used to have street cars going up and down some of our main streets. At some point in the 60's or 70's they removed all of those in favor of lowering costs and making more room for cars. Its been through poor planning and assumption that they'll have an infinite supply of cheap petrol that we've gotten here.<p>We started most of the cities pre-car, but once cars hit, we somehow thought the suburbs were a good idea and that everyone should be able to travel anywhere in a short period of time on their own.",1321974136

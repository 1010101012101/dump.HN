Also started my own, but no longer associated with that industry.<p>To be honest, young people are very talented, they haven't been moulded into a certain shape or way yet, and I tend to get the feeling they think more out of the box.<p>That being said, with age comes wisdom, you start to learn more and more, what works, and what doesn't work.<p>You either have talent, or you don't, sure experience is good. But people evolve in different ways, some faster than others. Even though you're younger than your competition, you still might have more experience, or you just might be 10x better. I've only been turned down once for a fulltime job at Philips, when I was 18. They liked my work but wanted someone older. I could fully understand that, and wasn't too bothered by it.

But before there is such a bank, all efforts put into creating a top-notch bank system is more or less wasted, as all good projects needs real-life applications from start to be built around, otherwise you are just writing code for imaginary problems without any proof any of the code is useful in real-life.<p>So if any bank is willing to step up and embrace the idea, I'm sure there are a lot of excellent coders with relevant skills out joining forces, just for the fun of it, and will of course gladly move their business to a bank where they can participate as a developer.<p>A first step for such a bank could be to open source all their existing code of their legacy systems, or at least documentation, internal APIs and stuff. This would help the rest of the world of non-COBOL coders to get a picture of what's in a bank system. I for one don't know, but have an idea of it.<p>I'm the founder of a payment solution provider myself, and we work with a lot of banks, aronud 30 I think. Non of them offer any APIs. If anyone would have one, we would probably move a lot of our business to such a bank, I can only dream of the tens of thousands lines of code I code probably reduce to a few hundred lines of integration code.",1347712689

1957397,comment,1956981,1957377,0,0,jamesaguilar,,,"Are you actually trying to argue with me, or just taking a potshot at the USG? If the latter, please use someone else's comment as a platform and not mine. If the former . . .<p>Sheer pointlessness is meant to encompass several reasons I believe the USG is an unlikely culprit.<p>First, there's the risk of significant consequences if the USG's involvement comes to public light. There's another election in two years, so even the PR damage could cost them. Then there's the matter of this kind of action being illegal. Maybe no prosecution would occur, but maybe it would.<p>Second, unlike your security theater example, there is literally zero chance of this doing any good for anyone. Every person who is even the least bit interested could obtain the documents with only minor effort considering how widely they have been distributed. Major news organizations have already collated them for the masses.<p>On the other hand, ""security theater"" and ""unwinnable wars"" are only pointless in a debatable sense. There are obviously a large number of people who believe that airport security measures are having some positive effect. Similarly, by some metrics (not mine), the war in Iraq has been successful and the war in Afghanistan is heading in that direction too. I don't doubt in hindsight that they will prove to be mistakes, but that is not the same as their having a absolutely known ""pointlessness"" value now. So I think that objection of yours is incorrect as well.<p>Also, you've only pointed out two pointless things the USG has done in the past decade. That's not the same as proving that the USG is equally inclined to do pointless things as pointful ones. In fact, it may be that the USG discards pointless courses of action at a much higher rate than pointful ones, but that certain pointless actions have been enacted nonetheless. In this case, it would still be predictive of the US not being involved that the Wikileaks DOS is pointless.<p>Finally, I'm not aware that it is the USG's standard infosec policy to maintain batteries of compromised civilian computers with which to perform cyber warfare. Perhaps it is, but that would be quite a discovery in and of itself.<p>So, there are a lot of problems with your line of reasoning. I could be wrong, but I think the odds are something like 80-20 that I am right and this is not the USG's doing.",1291197573

1957391,comment,1956851,1956851,0,0,retube,,,"It really depends on the company(ies). There's a lot to be said for working at a big established outfit: clear paths to career progression, decent and reliable pay, the kudos of working for a firm people have likely heard of, mostly free weekends and evenings. The downsides are office politics, bad managers (inevitable), the constant feeling that things could be done better/more efficiently, being a small largely unknown cog in a big machine. And yes after a few years people do tend to get disillusioned and hacked off - often prompting a move to the country or a start-up or something different.<p>Saying that I wouldn't knock the experience. Seeing how big businesses operate is probably an important education for every wannabe entrepreneur. And if you learn to play the corporate game you can do very well - and put away a few dollars for when you make the jump to something a bit more risky.<p>Startups will generally involve less pay, longer hours and a more unstable / insecure career outlook. So if you decide to go this route, choose your firm with great care. But saying that, in a smaller firm you'll be closer to teh day-to-day administration of the business which also would be great experience re starting your own outfit.",1291197312

I'm getting real responsibility i.e. responsibility for clients, working across several roles not just one like you'd get if you join a larger firms graduate scheme.

[1]<p>- The article title implies that this is somehow a spectacular finding. Doing word sense disambiguation for one word is not that interesting, and there is no comparison with existing methods to show that this is actually a high score. I suspect that it is not that spectacular, since 'Apple' is relatively easy to disambiguate using a few context words.<p>[1] E.g. see:<p>- Using Wikipedia for Automatic Word Sense Disambiguation, R. Mihalcea, 2007, for a discussion of using Wikipedia to train a word sense disambiguator.<p>- Integrating multiple knowledge sources to disambiguate word sense: An exemplar-based approach, H.T. Ng and H.B. Lee, 1996, provide a good overview of types of features that can be used in disambiguation. They use features that go beyond simple 'bag of word' and 'bag of n-gram' features, e.g. by using syntactical patterns.<p>There is a whole lot more research of course, but just to show two examples that describe far more sophisticated approaches.",1291196823

I think clickety-click interfaces where you modify the interface through various selections / drag-n-dropping are seriously flawed.<p>Yes, MS Office is a nice example of what a WYSIWYG interface can do, but that's just for standard documents.

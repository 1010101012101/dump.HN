Any data?<p>Edit, as I found this (<a href=""http://blog.rightscale.com/2008/08/20/amazon-ebs-explained/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.rightscale.com/2008/08/20/amazon-ebs-explained/</a>):\n""As a point of reference, our main database server is pretty busy and chugs along at an average of 17 transactions per second, which should total to around $4.40 per month. But our monitoring servers, prior to some recent optimizations, hammered the disks as fast as they would go at over 1000 random writes per second sustained 24×7. That would end up costing over $250 per month! As far as I can tell, for most situations the EBS transaction costs will be in the noise, but you can make it expensive if you’re not careful.""",1219316398

If there was no perceived repression associated with particular words they wouldn't have any effect and invoking them in unrelated discussion wouldn't make any sense.<p>In other words, swearing is a contemporary cultural statement akin to ""stick it to The Man"". I think it is fair to say that it is a pretty cheap oratory trick, since it is just an appeal to a common cause rather than an argument or viewpoint that can stand on its own merit.<p>That's not to say it is not funny or effectfull, it's just orthogonal to substance. It is the web 2.0 glossy UI of modern language.",1219315199

Your concept of 'race' has nothing to do with reality - you can't just take the color of peoples skin and group them all together. It's very superficial, and is totally unrelated to any biological reality.",1219314885

In the sense that I consider mathematics to be philosophy, of course I accept it. I just don't like that almost all non-mathematical philosophy texts I have encountered start from invalid assumptions.",1219314369

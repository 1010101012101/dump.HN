73004,comment,72606,72621,0,0,mmiller,,,"""Worse Is Better"" is an old article, I think from the early 1990s. Back then Lisp did run slowly. I can remember taking a course around 1989/1990 that had us running the n-queens problem in Lisp. People would start up their n-queens programs on Unix minis and leave them running unattended, to go away for lunch or something. The programs ran for hours. This is the reason why Gabriel talks about scale (memory size) and performance. Today these are not really issues anymore. I can run the same n-queens program on my PC and it'll take just a second or two to run. That's a dramatic difference.",1193432049

I think most non-IDE editors also try to offer completions, though. It's one reason I can't stand Rails: all that passing around of parameters in Hashes is fundamentally not autocompletable.

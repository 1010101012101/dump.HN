2480824,comment,2480481,2480547,6,0,rflrob,,,"> For all RMS knows, this advice could be alexey's way of manipulating him into working against what he values.<p>Some of the advice that I remember most from the original post was about things that are tangential, at best, to FLOSS.  Referring to the Kindle as the ""Swindle"" is related, but conspiracy theories about 9/11 and ""Big Brother"" almost certainly aren't.<p>> If alexey is honest in his sincerity, he could reiterate his points more strongly with evidence. 'It looks like a crazy marginalized perspective' is something to think about, but there's no weight to the argument offered. Does RMS's talks do worse than expected? Is it caused by people ending up with this opinion after hearing him?<p>I think the main piece of evidence he offered was data on what his friends did: ""<i>Several friends of mine who had not heard of the FSF before left half way through because they were so put off by some of conspiratorial rhetoric above.</i>""  While not an unbiased sample, it's about all you can expect from someone's after-action report on one talk that he went to.",1303721990

Very well written . The education system in India is absolutely a joke. 
Here is how it works . After 10th exams you take up science for 10+2. Simultaneously, you enroll for Maths,Physics and Chemistry tutions ( for IIT entrence exams). If you are dedicated ,hardworking ,sharp and have no social life ( ie do not do the things every teenager should do viz chase girls, get laid, loaf around) you might get into IITs or a good NIT ( say 3000 seats) . All others are doomed to join B/C grade colleges. Here comes the catch. Such colleges do not teach anything , they just print degrees . Students mug up OS, DB , Networking, Software Engg and pass out with distiction but are not able to install Windows or change IP address . Setting classpath/path or coding( BFS/DFS/Data Str / Searching & Sorting) is a far cry.<p>When i graduated ( with a CS degree from a B grade college ) I could not write ""Hello world"" in  any language , did not know how to query records. However, I was placed in the first company that came to campus.  These are USD 10 billion companies that build and maintain ""MISSION CRITICAL"" applications for all the ""Movers & Shakers"" of US of A.<p>Four years down the line , thanks to internets ( Esp Hacker News) I can code. From a zero to a decent programmer. My teammates(4-5 yrs of experience) can not write code that will print a directory structure. They can not complie code without eclipse. All they want is ""ONSITE""
This is the story of India that I know.

Basically, you angle the solar sail so that its force is directed against your direction of travel along your orbit.  This slows you down, causing you to start spiraling in toward the sun.  Then you change angle so that you start speeding up again and match orbital velocities just as you arrive at your destination.<p>But it's a separate issue anyway --  solar sail technology (or Vasimir, or Nuclear Thermal) is no more required for exploring Mars than jet airplane technology was required for exploring North America.",1303721046

I rounded up. You picked a list to illustrate your point (that Thailand and the Philippines are poor?). I picked one that better reflected GDP vs cost of living, which was my point.<p>I wasn't jumping down his throat specifically, I was saying that the term ""third world"" as applied to Thailand (and other countries) is a worthless description today. As the original commenter pointed out, it's related to the geopolitics of the Cold War. People often swap it for ""developing nation"" which is a euphemism for ""undeveloped by Western standards"" which I think is condescending and a culturally biased value judgement. When someone says ""third world"" I would say they either don't really understand the economics involved or are deliberately being derogatory to another people/nation.

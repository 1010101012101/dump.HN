9900143,comment,9894226,9900064,0,0,mikeash,,,"Recasting fraud reduction as &quot;1% in profits&quot; is extremely misleading, because fraud is a tiny proportion of overall activity. Reducing fraud by 1% of profits would require a <i>huge</i> improvement in your ability to fight fraud, whereas reducing legitimate transactions by 1% of profits is much easier.<p>And it&#x27;s not like card companies do absolutely nothing. The US is finally moving to chips, which will cut down a lot. Notably it&#x27;s just chips, <i>not</i> chip-and-PIN, because they want to keep that friction low. But when they are able to fight fraud while still keeping friction low, they do it.<p>I think the market is competitive enough that if people wanted more security, someone would offer it and it would gain in popularity. We <i>do</i> see this to an extent, with security features like sending transactions to your phone as they happen. In fact, a very few banks will issue you a chip-and-PIN card right now if you want it. Or you can get a debit-only card, with no credit features, so that a PIN is always required. Mostly people don&#x27;t seem to care, though.",1437083984

I&#x27;m going to build an another on-line social recipe app.  People type in recipes, they share those recipes, make comments on those recipes, maybe review the recipes, etc.  I think their metrics break down very quickly when you start doing more interesting things like, taking automatically finding similar recipes based on the descriptions of the steps in the recipes.  Or maybe performing a recommendation of recipes based on a user&#x27;s rating of recipes.<p>Or, for that matter, correctly internationalizing the recipes and conversion of measurement units.  (You don&#x27;t want to have add 3.43272 cups of flour to 0.2347 gallons of water, when translating metric to imperial - you&#x27;ll need logic to scale up/down quantities and round within a given tolerance - which is often narrow when you start baking pastries).

Keep in mind that in San Francisco, dental hygienists earn roughly the same salary as software developers at the median, and nurses earn considerably more [1].  There are still good reasons to want to be one rather than the other, but age discrimination, job stability, and work-life balance are not areas where software development shines.<p>As it stands, I think it is critical to expand good educational opportunities, but I think that this will simply expand the number of people who decide that other career options are better.  In short, we will go from having a lot of people who can&#x27;t choose to become software developers because they don&#x27;t have that educational opportunity to having a lot of people who choose not to become software engineers because they now have better opportunities.<p>[1] check regional salary information at us news best jobs, which is a roundup of BLS data.",1437083422

Having a soup of those molecules in water, some of the molecules would naturally clump together with hydrophilic ends outside and hydrophobic ends inside - kind of a small bubble. Now if on contact of a bubble with another molecule, the molecule is added into the bubble (similar like a bunch of magnets clumped together &quot;assimilate&quot; another magnet piece correctly orienting it), the bubble gets bigger and at some point it would naturally splits into 2 smaller bubbles (surface tension, etc...) and each bubble would continue the &quot;assimilation&quot;/growth and division in their turn as long as there are such molecules around...

Many parolees are required to go to AA or anger management classes, and those are full of other people in the same predicament. The same applies to halfway housing.<p>I imagine that since this ride was under the control of an official non-profit, the contact was approved.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of the rules limiting free association and I think it should be considered a violation of civil liberties. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ever been challenged in the courts.",1437080608

Going 3D makes sense for memory, because these devices aren&#x27;t heat-limited, but for CPUs it&#x27;s not at all clear that stacking layers would be a win. CPUs are limited by heat, and heat transport away from the CPU is proportional to area, not volume.<p>Also, CPU costs are driven mostly by lithography, and if you&#x27;re doubling the number of high resolution lithography steps, you aren&#x27;t saving much money compared to just making larger area CPUs.",1437080483

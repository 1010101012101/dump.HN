In case of graphics you usually start with local coordinates of your  object. These have to be mapped to world coordinates, camera coordinates, and finally a perspective projection to get the screen coordinates. All these mappings can be expressed as matrices and applying mapping A after B is the same as applying the matrix product A*B to your initial coordinate vector. Precomputing the entire transformation matrix in this way causes quite a speedup for long transformation pipelines.",1451476757

But it could also be partly true, e.g. pointing to a real loss that we suffered because of the infusion of technology in everyday life.<p>Here are some examples of technologically-caused issues that a lot of people, if not most, could do without: environmental damage due to modern mining, plastics, etc. Noise pollution. Cities designed around cars, that destroy the human scale and prevent the kind of relationships and urban life fostered by places like Manhattan, Vienna, Paris, etc. Technology as enabler of surveillance and loss of privacy. Military technology that can blow the world 10 times over. The same-ization of the world and the cheapening of cities due to global commerce, tourism, etc. Loss of quality time with friends and other people in the era of the smartphone. That one might point at improvements in other areas that offset these negatives/losses , doesn&#x27;t mean there wasn&#x27;t any loss in the first place.<p>A last possible case, regarding the original complaint, is that while it might be said for &quot;hundreds of years&quot; it could be especially true now. Just because people might claim it&#x27;s midnight from early morning doesn&#x27;t mean that it wont eventually be midnight.<p>And I&#x27;d argue that that&#x27;s the case, myself.<p>If somebody complained about the prevalence of technology in the eighties (and several people did), predicting that it will get to a point that we&#x27;ll be so depended on it, as to have cpus in every damn thing, including our keys, shoes, microwaves, etc, they would have told him that he fell for the &quot;slippery slope&quot; fallacy. Well, the Internet of Thing is the actual realization of that slippery slope.",1451476439

It is not entirely obvious that this is a stupid thing to do; hence the thought experiment.

Will it rather successfully learn all the tricks to convert matter into paperclips before it considers studying human values?

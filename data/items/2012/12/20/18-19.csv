The worst issues that we had during the last release cycle did result in data corruption, one due to a bug in our code. Another due to a filesystem we weren't expecting (which we still consider to be a bug in our code.)<p>Right now we can't recommend RethinkDB for production ready code but we're working very hard to get it to that point. Part of this is beefing up our internal testing system which we've made a big push on during the last release cycle. Part of that is fixing all of the bugs that users submit until they stop finding serious ones.",1356029991

4949258,comment,4947831,4948847,13,0,dctoedt,,,"1.  Assume for the sake of argument that imprisonment of suspected terrorists without trial violates the Fifth Amendment.  The question then becomes:  What must the government <i>do</i> about the violation --- that is, what is the prisoner's <i>remedy</i>?<p>A) The canonical remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the writ of habeas corpus [1].  When a court issues ""the Great Writ,"" it orders the prisoner's jailer(s) to bring the prisoner to court and, by implication, to release the prisoner if the court so directs.<p>B) Article 1 of the Constitution expressly empowers Congress to <i>suspend</i> habeas corpus --- in other words, to strip from courts the authority to order the release of prisoners --- ""when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."" [2]  Nothing in the Fifth Amendment alters this congressional power of suspension.<p>C) It might be argued that in enacting the Patriot Act, Congress <i>partially</i> suspended habeas corpus in response to the ""Invasion"" we call 9/11.<p>D) The courts try to interpret the various parts of the Constitution to be in harmony with one another if at all possible.<p>E) So, ""properly"" interpreted, the Fifth Amendment might not stand in the way of imprisonment without trial in a case covered by a congressional suspension of habeas corpus.  (The breadth of this possibility troubles me, incidentally; also, I'm far from a constitutional scholar.)<p>------------<p>2.  As to whether the Constitution prohibits killing an enemy combatant in wartime without individualized due process in each case:  That'd be a really, <i>really</i> tough sell, not least because if that principle had been followed, the U.S. would not long have survived as an independent state.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus</a><p>[2] U.S. Const., art. 1, sec. 9, <a href=""http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec9.html</a>",1356029744

It's basically a contract that represents the last time Americans ever managed to (kinda) agree on anything.<p>You also have to keep in mind that debates about Constitutionality arise over politically unpopular topics. It's a way for people with minority viewpoints to say: ""well, whether you think this is good or bad, it is inconsistent with this larger scheme we all agreed to.""<p>If you held a vote and asked people whether they thought people accused of terrorism, especially abroad, should have rights, you'd lose. I remember in college being the lone dissenting voice in a discussion of the merits of turning the entire Middle East into a glass parking lot. Ordinary Americans believe very deeply in the sovereign right of the American government to kill foreigners who do anything contrary to American interests.<p>Hence the resort to legalism. You can't convince Americans that it's good for suspected terrorists to be given trials, etc, so the best you can hope to do is convince them that they, collectively, bargained away the ability to hold suspected terrorists without trial.",1356029677

This was actually one of the reasons that Einstein did not want to accept quantum theory.  In fact, he proposed quantum entanglement as an argument against the validity of quantum theory.  According to quantum theory, transfer of information faster than the speed of light should be possible (via quantum entanglement).  Therefore, quantum theory was incorrect/incomplete- that was Einstein's reasoning.<p>There would still have to be an entanglement step.  The photons need to be coupled.  This is currently accomplished by a laser across long distances.  I suppose that in this sense there is a latency at the speed of light to add new particles.

4949242,comment,4948927,4949145,22,0,jdoliner,,,"RethinkDB is filled with developers who have conflicted thoughts on this. The difference between structured and unstructured database systems has always seemed very analogous static vs. dynamic type systems to me. Most of us at RethinkDB like our type systems static, Haskell being one of the favored languages, and we've had many conversation about why our database doesn't reflect these same principles.<p>I'll admit that to some degree RethinkDB is responding to what we see as the direction the market is moving. People seem to really like developing in dynamic languages using structureless databases. I think that a lot of times this gives people more ways to shoot themselves in the foot (and I sense you agree). But even if this type of development was purely a band of fools shooting off each other's feet we still might have to respond to it.<p>That being said I don't think it is quite so foolish an endeavor. The thing about structured databases that sucks, and a place where the analogy to dynamic languages breaks down, is that your data integrity becomes entrenched. Changing around static types in your code isn't anywhere near as hard as changing around a static structure in your database because you need to modify all the old data to make it meet the new structure. This can be a very cumbersome process made more cumbersome by the fact that a lot of structured databases make optimizations based on things like knowing the size of each row (very hard to change on the fly). So while RethinkDB doesn't dislike data integrity we do really dislike data stasis and that's what we wanted to avoid. We do have plans for the future of having a way to enforce arbitrary constraints over you database, we just aren't willing to do them in such a way that they're hard to change. Unfortunately doing them in that way is time consuming and we haven't gotten to it yet.<p>jdoliner @ rethinkdb",1356029511

A similar search for ""Ireland banking crisis"" leads to a similar set of papers where people discuss how to pull Ireland out of the mud.<p>So what does this say about Marty's writing style? and our reading of it? Well it says Marty throws out his emotional angst over this (perhaps he advocated the debt canceling path for Ireland, I don't know) with his comment that ""some people"" recommended things known to work, clearly at least a few of those people were advising the Icelandic government as they implemented those ideas. If we're engaged readers we do our own legwork, we can attach names to those people. It's more work for us, and perhaps less satisfying that way.<p>The comment was accused of not saying ""anything"" when in fact it did say things. What it did not do was to lay out evidence for the claims made, Further, the use of the passive voice made pulling out the information which would help the reader research the claims more difficult.<p>So there are at least three things going on here, one an emotional rant from someone who believed in strategies that Iceland implemented, but were widely criticized in other economies, feeling vindicated. Second, a quickly thrown together narrative about the tunnel vision which lead to this situation. And finally, a turgid writing style which imposes an unnecessary burden on the reader trying to understand the meaning or substance behind the rant.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mercatus.org/publication/iceland-and-ireland-banking-crises-lessons-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercatus.org/publication/iceland-and-ireland-banking-...</a>",1356029372

4949224,comment,4948961,4948961,8,0,thuffy,,,"Why are we even discussing guns? They account for less than 0.5% of deaths (excluding suicides) in the USA. You are two and a half times more likely to fall to your death accidentally than be killed by a gun. You are three and a half times more likely to die in a car crash.<p>Heart disease kills 28 innocent people in the USA every 25 minutes! Cancer kills another 28 innocent people in that time! More innocent people die from car crashes every minute than die from guns. Does a mad gunman kill 28 people every 25 minutes? I haven't even heard of any more such shooting this week, nevermind every 25 minutes since the Sandy Hook incident.<p>Guns don't even make the top 15 list* (below)! And #15 ranks in at 2.8% the amount of deaths as #1. In the interest of tackling problems that would actually make a meaningful difference, looking at causes at that small percentage of the problem is really a waste of time.<p>If any remember not too long ago, the 'year of the shark', it is much like how that 'epidemic' of shark attacks was suddenly so pressing in our consciousness. Not because you had any chance at all of dying of shark attacks, but simply because the media had chosen to spotlight the infinitesimally small amount of deaths caused by sharks. Just as you have no chance to die of sharks, you have no chance to die from guns. Just because the media purposely chooses to fill their pages with mostly gun crime doesn't mean that what they choose to report actually reflects the ratios that exist in reality. The tyrants have an agenda to disarm the people so that they can more easily enslave them. Just as the tyrants of Russia took control of the media in order to sway peoples opinions to suit their agenda, the tyrants of our countries have long ago done so as well.<p>In the USA, approximately 6,755 people die - every day. Twenty eight people dying is a sad thing, but irrelevant to the 6,755 people that die every day! The national media focuses on this negligible number of deaths because it suits the agenda of the parasitic ruling class. If they didn't choose to focus on it (for weeks and weeks even), then it would just be another 0.4145% of the deaths that occurred in a day.<p>Guns are our only defense against the next Trotsky, Stalin, Lennin or Mao once again purging a 100 million of their own people. Let's ban cars instead of guns. It would prevent more deaths, and cars are a lot less important to our freedom than guns. I would rather walk or bike to work than be thrown in the next gulag or purged because we allowed the tyrants to disarm their people.<p><i>Note that it is right to exclude suicides because: a) really, those people have the right to die, b) only half of suicides are by guns, thus you would only cut suicide by 50%, and c) you wouldn't even cut it by 50% as probably most of those people would use another way to kill themselves just like the other 50% of people who commit suicide do. Regardless, even if you don't exclude suicide then you are still more likely to die from falling or an auto accident than by a gun.</i><p>Proof of the pure BS that the media is stirring up against guns:<p>From the CDC's: National Vital Statistics Report, Volume 60, Number 4 (January 2012)<p>Numbers for 2010 (latest tabulated in the 2012 report):<p>Total deaths in 2010: 2,465,932<p>595,444	Heart Disease<p>573,855	Cancer<p>137,789	Chronic lower respiratory disease<p>129,180	Cerebrovascular disease<p>118,043	Accidents [<i>A]<p>83,308		Alzheimer's<p>68,905		Diabetes mellitus<p>50,472		Influenza and pneumonia<p>37,793		Suicide [</i>S]<p>37,843		Septicemia<p>31,802		Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<p>26,577		Essential hypertension and hypertensive renal disease<p>21,963		Parkinson's disease<p>17,001		Pneumonitis due to solids and liquids<p>...

Exclusion constraints are even better, if you have a table with allocations (date ranges, integer ranges, etc) you can check so that none of the allocations overlap.

The topic of LinkedIn, credibility, and endorsements came up and he suggested that perhaps someday in the future loans could be based off of your endorsements. I disagreed, stating that I didnt think endorsements were very accurate but couldnt fully explain why. This was my analysis.<p>1) A break-down by LinkedIn contacts:\nI have been endorsed by 26 people of the 845 (3%) Im connected to on LinkedIn. I began realizing I didnt know some of the people endorsing me so I created some criteria for my endorsers: \n	-Never met: 19% of endorsements\n	-Never done business with: 50% of endorsements\n	-Havent seen in 5+ years: 46% of endorsements\n	-Didnt recognize their name and had to pull up their profile: 19%<p>2) I decided to Social Graph my profile and found that the largest categories of people I know are: 1) From the financial industry 2) CEOs or executives 3) Entrepreneurs 4) From Oregon/hometown/school alumni 5) Team members from my previous company. These all make sense because the last company I founded works with the financial industry, so my social circle has evolved to primarily entrepreneurs and people in the financial industry.<p><a href=""http://ow.ly/i/1h9IB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ow.ly/i/1h9IB</a><p>3) Of these groups, who arguably know me the best of anyone I had:<p>-0 active CEOs or C level executives (non-entrepreneurs) \n-0 co-workers or team members\n-0 investors from my previous company (none of which are not on LinkedIn)<p>4) The first listed 2 endorsements of the initial 13 I selected became my #1 and #2 skillset.<p>Some thoughts on Endorsements<p>1) The quality of the endorsements has a ways to go.  \n-Endorsers often have a small impact on ones real life, but can majorly impact ones professional perception.\n-It seems that a fairly high % of people who endorse have some type of vested interest be it getting business from LinkedIn, networking for jobs, gaining topic expertise or driving traffic.<p>2) Your mind is tricking you.\n-People choose what is listed first: My #1 and #2 skills and endorsements were the first two skills listed.\n-Visual Deception: People love graphs, they remember them. They also only remember a couple things about you, like your #1 skill. This is a terrible thing because by nature we automatically assume this person is not as good at the other things and we begin typecasting. Would you agree that your #1 endorsement is your strongest skill? Would you say you are twice as good as your #1 endorsement as your #2 endorsement? These are some of the impressions this is building.  \n-Group Think: If someone else thinks youre good at X, you must be, so Ill endorse that also. This creates an echo chamber.<p>3) The dynamic of endorsing people can get awkward, which may prevent accurate endorsements. Would you endorse your professor while taking a class from them? How about your manager while working for them? The owner of the company where you work?<p>4) Higher ups arent on LinkedIn. The people who arguably have the most influence on me as an entrepreneur are not actively on LinkedIn and certainly are not out endorsing people.<p>The bottom line is that a vocal minority may influence the majority so be careful what impressions your endorsements may give of you. The people who spend the most time on LinkedIn are probably not the ones you want determining who you are.<p>Disclaimer: Thank you to those who have endorsed me. I know you have done so with the intention of helping me and it is appreciated. This post is about the social flaws with LinkedIns Endorsements and also about the behavioral economics behind online social influence.",1356027906

In a nutshell it uses one of the educational content management systems (online courseware) and makes educational content free. About 2 weeks ago I saw someone on TV that reinvigorated me on the idea.<p>I start in prisons and jails. Not only do we provide educational materials so that these people can get a top education but more importantly, the system is secure so that persons on the inside can have access to select professionals on the outside to help them. Some would be mental health professionals, others mentors. And it would allow them to do job interviews just before release. And the system will have materials specifically for that demo like domestic violence courses, drug addiction and so on.<p>And what really sets this apart is that I had a business man from Sarasota that was willing to turn one of his motels into transitional housing. While there the people would still have access to this program. In meetings with corrections officials they said that the biggest problem is that a lot of the people they see are not bad people, they just have nothing else to go back to so within 3 years 70% are back in prison.<p>Now how can this change the world? Because once we get the thing set up and running I want to develop a tablet like the $100 laptop and make it like a $50 tablet. These can then be distributed to any population that needs education. Here in the US it can be any low income or rural area. If we can get them into the hands of say young Afghan or Iranian women they can study from anywhere and get educated. All they need is a wifi connection that can be part of what we do in partnering with other companies to provide that. In one generation we can change the fabric of that society. Mothers will raise educated children and so on.<p>I tried to get it done back then, I got a couple people interested but couldn't get anyone that knew how to raise funds.

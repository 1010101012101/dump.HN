You use 32-bit float wavs to transport stuff around so you don't have to worry about normalizing levels and clipping. Lossless formats drastically improve the quality of transients by an enormous degree. But every single objection to this is either ignoring the points of the article, or talking about the benefits of recording at high fidelity, when this entire article is pointing out that once you have _finished a mix_, there is no reason to distribute things in 24-bit/192kHz. Most speakers can't even play about 20kHz anyway, which makes the entire point moot. I don't care if you have a bajillion kHz, the speakers can't play about 20 kHz, so your screwed.",1330988263

3668806,comment,3667052,3667520,1,0,toyg,,,"One of the best Italian artists of all time, Giorgio Gaber, said once that ""Democracy is Participation"", or ""taking part"". Check the number of active voters in the US at most levels: it's depressingly low. Low participation means less democracy, it's as simple as that.<p>Most people thought it would have been impossible for a black man to be President of the United States of America, but for once ""the people"" thought differently, you got the highest turnout ever for a presidential race, and lo and behold, change happened (at least for that particular thing).<p>Try to imagine how things would change if you could add another 10 or 20% to that 63% who elected a black President. Now repeat that at any level: Congress, State, City, even school board. All of a sudden you have a decisive element that can change majorities and express real power.<p>The problem, of course, is that ""taking part takes time"". Politics is a very slow game, and most people have a life outside of politics, so they drop out (me included). Even voting every few years is a problem, if you can't afford to take a day off; most European countries recognize that, and vote over the weekend. I find the US stance on this incredibly maddening, and clearly a legacy from the dark times of slavery and ""gentlemen"" landowners who didn't have to work for a living.<p>The problem, going forward, is how to give people the opportunity to take part more and more, while minimizing the time they have to spend in order to do so. One of them is having a good set of impartial media who can summarize honest arguments in a faithful way, providing different levels of analysis that don't contradict themselves. Another one might be some sort of collaborative service where people can contribute to the work of their representatives. Another might be a way of making representatives more accountable and in tune to the wishes of their electorate. And so on and so on... but nothing of this can happen unless we <i>take part</i> and move our ass, so to speak.",1330988173

I knew many of the posters, and would have great arguments, some won, some lost but it didn't really matter because everyone shared a passion for knowledge, and would rather be proven wrong than not learn something new. The discussion was great.<p>The second year I started losing track of the usernames and thus it became less of a club of peers, and more of a regular forum, albeit a very high quality one.<p>The third year the site had attracted so many users that the original patos of intelligent discussion based on merit started to fade. Based on mere numbers this had to be so; for any given subject there are only a limited number of people that adhere to the standards to which we had becomme accustomed, and new users mistook nitpicking for good discussion.<p>The fourth year I've more or less stopped posting and discussing here, primarily because it's become a game of winning, and not a game of learning. Nitpicking is a great way of winning, but terrible if you want to have an interesting discussion. Negativity is highly correlated with nitpicking in this respect :-)<p>I remember the first year here i had a long discussion with MattMaroon about a linked story where a consultant had saved a company 100 million dollars by changing a few bits and pieces around in the check-out process. He was concinced the company was Amazon, I was convinced it wasn't. The discussion dragged on, and we each tried to throw statistics, numbers and good guesses on the table, until at the end Matt found a link directly confirming that it was indeed amazon. He was right, and we were both happy because now we knew. I don't see many of those discussions anymore. Unfortunately.",1330988039

In 1975, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was using a head shaped microphone, which was presumably an attempt to reproduce the non-linearity of the ear.  It would be interesting to do such experiments with digital sampling.<p>Thinking about it, if every person has a different non-linear response, in theory the only way to reproduce sound beyond a certain threshold of fidelity would be to reproduce the ultrasonic components, so each person would hear their own non-linearity.   (That would be beyond what I can hear or care about, but it would be fun to play with.  Beyond a certain level we also get to the point where we need to ask what it means to hear a sound.)",1330987763

Can you please point out any country who defines itself, in official terms, as a ""Democracy""? Even classic Athens didn't call itself such a thing. This is because democracy is not a set of laws: it's a declaration of principles, an abstract utopia of where your laws should come from (i.e. ""the people""), traditionally associated with some sort of voting system. On the formal level, there is no  clear definition of a complete form of government called a ""democracy""; it's commonly assumed such a thing involves some sort of voting rights (better if universal), but that's about it. The term is used to indicate the utopic state where government is carried out ""by the people"" in its totality. There has been no such <i>perfect</i> government throughout history and probably there never will be, but it's an utopia from which real forms of government can find justification and inspiration.<p>You can compare a ""constitutional republic"" to a ""constitutional monarchy"" or an ""absolute monarchy"": they are all specific forms of government with very specific common <i>formal</i> traits. A ""democracy"" is a completely different concept. You live in a constitutional republic based on democratic principles, i.e. a democracy... albeit a flawed one, like all of them are. You should strive to make your republic as genuinely democratic as possible, not renounce your rights ""because after all we've never been a democracy"".",1330986650

3668681,comment,3667049,3667235,27,0,rjn945,,,"I think this has a lot to do with it. After an hour of reading, watching and thinking, I can't come up with any way to put it into one paragraph.<p>Here's the shortest what and why I could come up with:<p><i>Questioning Assumptions</i><p>Many relational databases today operate based on assumptions that were true in the 1970s but are no longer true. Newer solutions such as key-value stores (""NoSQL"") make unnecessary compromises in the ability to perform queries or make consistency guarantees. Datomic reconsiders the database in light of current computer set-ups: millions of times larger and faster disks and RAM, and distributed architectures connected over the internet.<p><i>Data Model</i><p>Instead of using table-based storage with explicit schemas, Datomic uses a simpler model wherein the database is made up of a large collection of ""datoms"" or facts. Each datom has 4 parts: an entity, an attribute, a value, and a time (denoted by the transaction number that added it the database). Example:<p><pre><code>  John, :street, ""23 Swift St."", T27</code></pre>
This simple data model has two main benefits. It makes your data less rigid and hence more agile and easier to change. Additionally, it makes it easy to handle data in non-traditional structures, such as hierarchies, sets or sparse tables. It also enables Datomic's time model...<p><i>Time</i><p>Like Clojure, Datomic incorporates an explicit model of time. All data is associated with a time and new data does not replace old data, but is added to it. Returning to our previous example, if John later changes his address, a new datom would be added to the database, e.g.<p><pre><code>  John, :street, ""17 Maple St."", T43</code></pre>
This mirrors the real world where the fact that John has moved does not erase the fact that John once lived on Swift St. This has multiple benefits: the ability to view the database at a point in time other than the present; no data is lost; the immutability of each datom allows for easy and pervasive caching.<p><i>Move Data and Data Processing to Peers</i><p>Traditionally databases use a client-server model where clients send queries and commands to a central database. This database holds all the data, performs all data processing, and manages the data storage and synchronization. Clients may only to access the data through the interface the server provides - typically SQL strings which may include a (relatively small) set of functions provided by the database.<p>Datomic breaks this system apart. The only centralized component is data storage. Peers access the data storage through a new distributed component called a transactor. Finally, the most important part, data processing, now happens in the clients, which, considering their importance, have been renamed ""peers"".<p>Queries are made in a declarative language called Datalog which is similar to but better than SQL. It's better because it more closely matches the model of the data itself (rather than thinking in terms of the implementation of tables in a database). Additionally, it's not restricted like SQL. It allows you to use your full programming language. You can write reusable rules that can then be composed in queries. Additionally, you can call any of your own functions. This is a big step up in power and it's made practical because of the distribution. If ran your query on central server, you'd have to be concerned about tying up a scare resource with a long-running query. When processing locally, that's not a concern.<p>When a query is performed that data is loaded from central storage and placed into RAM (if it will fit). Later queries can use this locally cached data for fast queries.<p>----<p>That's definitely not all it does or all the benefits, but hopefully that's a good start.",1330986626

3668654,comment,3668310,3668539,4,0,femto,,,"Playing Devil's Advocate...<p>The statement that frequencies above 20kHz don't matter rests upon the assumption that the ear is linear.  If the ear is not linear (I don't know whether it is not not) then frequencies above 20kHz will matter, as the ear will be able to mix higher frequencies down to less than 20kHz.  For example, if we have frequencies of 56kHz and 59kHz, the ear MIGHT be able to discern a difference frequency of 3kHz.  No doubt this effect could be reproduced by signal with a sampling rate of 44.1KHz, but only if the analogue systems, before the sampling stage, reproduce any non-linearity in the human ear.<p>Incidentally, you can get speakers that create a localised beam of sound, that the person sitting next to you cannot hear.  They work by transmitting frequencies above the audible range.  These high frequencies can be beamformed by a relaitively small speaker array, so the sound is localised.  They then rely on the non-linearity of the ear (or maybe the air around the ear?) to mix the ultrasonic frequencies down to audible frequencies.  I guess there must be non-linearity in the human auditory system!<p>On the subject of 24-bits my understanding is that 16-bits is adequate, provided the levels (scaling) are set correctly in the recording.  What 24-bits delivers is the ability to do a crappy job of the mixing, and still end up with the full dynamic range of the human ear.  24-bits is probably a temporary solution though, as manufacturers will engage in the usual Loudness War [1], and push the signal to the top of the dynamic range.  Before long 24-bit audio will be equivalent to 16-bits (since the 8 least significant bits will be unused) and the next big thing will be 32-bit audio.<p>Having said all that, I'd guess that the speakers will be the limiting factor in most sound systems, not the recording format.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war</a>",1330986286

Based on my guts, market knowledge  and a few problem interviews with peers in other companies, there appears to be a demand for this application outside my company.<p>Ive discussed the matter with my boss and he would be interested in pushing this further, i.e. free half of my time to finalise the development and, if all goes well, release me at the end of the year to start my company.<p>We're somehow in stealth mode (e.g. IT is not necessarily happy with this home grown application, but they fortunately have bigger fishes to fry at the moment), but I'm thinking about asking my company to incubate me and then do a spin-off .
At this stage, Id like to obtain time (my time), acces to some internal expertise (e.g. legal, IT Security, marketing) and why not some seed funding (but I have other options there).<p>Some context: Im a Procurement director at a Global Fortune 500 in Europe (were in the services industry). The application Im developing covers the needs of a distributed Procurement/Sourcing department (currently: 100+ users in 17 countries). As in a lot of services companies, Procurement is not exactly strategic, so it's neither a threat nor an opportunity. On the other hand, entrepreneurship is clearly a value of the company. I have a rather direct access to members of the executive committee (and the support of my boss).<p>I've identified a few reasons why my company would accept to incubate me (living the values of the company, giving it access to a tool it needs at a very preferred price, and possibly some shares in the spun-off company) But I'm struggling to see if this is compelling enough, or if there could  be more in this incubation for the company.<p>Do you have any experience with intrapreneurship / spin offs? What other benefits I could advertise to convince them to incubate me? Any pitfall I should be aware of (besides IP  I'm already working on this one)?<p>Thanks for your help!

Based on this, we'd be inclined to submit as soon as we've completed all parts of the application to our own minimum standard of satisfaction, then update as needed.<p>However, I've seen pg say in another HN thread that YC does not reread applications when they are resubmitted, ""so submit when you're ready for us to read it the only time we'll read it.""<p>I perceive the trade-off to be that the earlier we submit, the more time YC partners have to read our application and engage with us, but the less time we have to improve the application itself before submitting (better demo, more up-to-date answers, etc).

It's because there is so little response that being able to hear it would blow your eardrums (and even then, it might <i>still</i> be beyond your ability to hear it). There's no value in that.<p>> 24 bit doesn't offer any advantages to sound quality? Sheesh.<p>Not quite what TFA says. According to the article, 16 bits effectively covers the dynamic range of human hearing, so more than that is pointless <i>for music consumed</i> by human beings (hence all the stuff about 24bit being a good idea for mastering & production). If you're storing integers in the 0~16384 range, going from 16 bit integers to 32 bit ones is not going to give you ""better ints"", it's just going to waste 2 bytes per int. Same thing here.",1330985014

It's been digitally mastered some time ago so if it was mastered today, it would probably sound better, but still not great.

I disagree with it, too. It's a good thing it <i>appears nowhere in the fine article</i>. Are you actually confused about the difference between frequency and amplitude? Or did you misread the article?<p>""24 bit doesn't offer any advantages to sound quality? Sheesh.""<p>As brazzy rightly points out, ""Sheesh"" isn't a reasoned statement. It's an ejaculation. And, it turns out, the author talked about why sound engineers record with 24 bits; It has to do with pragmatic reasons about leaving room for the highest and lowest frequencies in the audio being recorded without clipping, as well as with the author's discussion of Nyquist considerations in the distributed product.<p>Your post is wrong in so many ways that would have been easily fixed by reading the linked article with even 8th-grade reading skills that the reasonable reader has to wonder if you're being deliberately obtuse. Are you?",1330984899

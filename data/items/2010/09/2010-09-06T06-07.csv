(See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Meal_Pack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_Meal_Pack</a> for the list of entrees in 2005.)  Certainly meat features in the majority, but every soldier can expect a vegetarian meal with some frequency.  Choosing her example meals, I think it's possible that the article's author was somewhat biased toward names like ""Swiss steak with Spanish sauce"" and away from pasta, baked beans and other commonly canned foods.<p>It's already been suggested that providing vegetarian meals is a logistical nonissue.  (Canadian soldiers are also entitled to Kosher and Halal meals, and I can't imagine that that's uncommon.)  But it's easy to imagine military professionals arguing the opposite.  Logistics, tactics, and esprit de corps are used to justify several kinds of bigotry and obstinacy in Western militaries.  It seems to me that, as a rule of thumb, legitimate military concerns do not easily justify lower standards of tolerance, human rights, or, (as Julien Assange will agree) openness.  Canada has rejected at least two of these arguments experimentally by allowing openly gay service members (unlike the US) and by permitting women to serve in every trade (unlike the US and the UK).",1283754108

My undergraduate degree was in Mech Eng. Even people with As in A-level maths and physics struggled with some of the course. Half (possibly more) of the freshers I enrolled with didn't graduate from that course with me, they either dropped out altogether or switched to something easier. Or some people repeated a year. But if you don't get partial differential equations (for example) on the second attempt, you're probably not going to get them ever. Doesn't mean you're a bad person - just means you should do something else with your life.<p>A vanishingly small percentage of the population is capable of a true university education. The only way to enroll more is to relax the standards and simplify the material. Which is exactly what New Labour did with their arbitrary goal of 50% of the population to be graduates.<p>BTW according to Wikipedia, of every 200 applicants to the SAS (most of whom have <i>already</i> qualified as Paras, they're already elite) only 30 make it.

There is a middle class developing.  Check out Hans Rosling's talks about it.<p>There may be a temporary bubble in the stock market, but China is undergoing an incredible shift towards becoming North American in every way.  Beijing is the best example of this - the entire city has been bulldozed and redeveloped in a North American big box way.  Shanghai is even further 'ahead'.<p>Traditionally Chinese have been very conservative with spending, preventing quick economic growth.  Credit cards are almost non-existent.  You pre-pay your bills, even electricity!  But for some reason - perhaps the Internets media influence, perhaps the one child policy, people are now spending money quickly.  Starbucks is extremely popular and more expensive than in Toronto, NYC or SF!  For the price of a coffee you could easily get a great meal with a few drinks, yet coffee shops are filled.<p>If all of it is a bubble - it is so firmly entrenched at ground level that the momentum of this bubble will burst through and last for decades.  New industries are developing rapidly.  The insurance industry was almost non-existent a decade ago, and is growing quickly in different ways there.<p>One thing is part of what is fuels the growth is international companies spending a lot of money trying to establish new business in China.  These companies are risking money and bringing expertise into a really unknown market and often losing money.  China in the end benefits as they just sit their with their vast market and allow foreign companies to try to create new industries.  If anything starts doing really well, the government could always regulate that industry and take it over themselves.<p>I don't see anything stopping both China and India both developing a large middle class.  That will snowball growth for decades.  Premium brands will likely dominate - these folks want iPhones and Mercedes.<p>I think this Australian iron ore example is just the beginning of the scale at which we will see commodities shifting to China.  I expect timber to happen at an enormous scale as their foresting practices seem quite unsustainable.",1283753939

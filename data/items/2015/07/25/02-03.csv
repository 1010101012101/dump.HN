But I&#x27;m still cooking at least once a day.<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say the reason Americans think cooking is hard is because they leave home at 7am so they can be at work by 9am. Then work until 5pm, and make it home by 7pm. And cooking, while not hard, does take time. Not much <i>time</i> in that schedule.<p>They also hold this weird notion that you can&#x27;t have dinner at 9pm, which is when I usually have it at.<p>But really what matters most is that they just don&#x27;t value it as much.",1437793176

9946364,comment,9941712,9946046,0,0,electronvolt,,,"> Your argument is perfectly reasonable, it would be nice if other feminists understood the difference. In my experience, it is more often used as a spark for a larger confrontation or an excuse to bash males in general.<p>This may be a kind of blunt observation, but perhaps you see what you&#x27;re looking for?<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve even met a single person, male or female, who seriously complained when someone (a) expressed interest in a reasonable way/place/situation and (b) was clearly willing to not continue if the person who had interest expressed in them did not reciprocate.  Both (a) and (b) have had to be the case for all men and women I know to be comfortable with people&#x27;s expression of interest:  and its been my female friend&#x27;s experience that men are generally much worse about both (a) and (b).  Does that mean all men are bad at (a) and (b)?  No.  But most of my friends who&#x27;re women have at least one story (usually many more) about a guy who was bad about both (a) and (b), and the incidence in friends who&#x27;re men is much lower (although goes up again if you limit it to just my gay friends--turns out gay men are not necessarily magical wizards about being good at (a) and (b)).  Taken out of context, a woman complaining about how several men have been bad at (a) and (b) in her life seems like something you&#x27;d be likely to read as &quot;bashing men&quot; as a whole, especially if you didn&#x27;t have any context for her complaints.  Not hearing the whole story here might be exacerbated if your general model for interacting with women who bring up their frustrations here is to go on the offensive. (&quot;not all men are like that!&quot;/etc.)  If I wanted to vent about an unpleasant experience, I know I wouldn&#x27;t go to someone I thought might engage me in an argument over it rather than listen, and I&#x27;d almost certainly shut down any argument that happened and refuse to share more if I felt like I was being attacked.  That&#x27;s human nature and not at all unreasonable:  the last place I would&#x27;ve gone after I was read as gay and threatened with violence by a group of drunk men would be someone who&#x27;d I&#x27;d imagine would&#x27;ve told me that &quot;not all Southern men are like that&quot; or questioned me on it--I went to the closest gay friendly bar I could find and promptly got sloshed before getting a trusted friend to drive me home.<p>> If you go to a college campus and attempt to set up a &quot;mens center&quot; in the same vein as the womens centers that are increasingly common, you will most likely be 1) called a misogynist, 2) not taken seriously, 3) not succeed.<p>The thing is:  is this a problem with feminism?  I&#x27;d argue no.  I think that you&#x27;d get a lot of pushback from more mainstream culture, and that push back would likely be very tied to patriarchal (as a hegemonic system) ideals about what men &quot;should&quot; be or do or how they &quot;should&quot; act.<p>> A &quot;sex positive&quot; outlook would not care whether or not Bayonetta was designed by or for men. Bayonetta would have the inherent right to dress and behave as she pleases, with no care for the viewer&#x27;s tastes.<p>As a fictional character, Bayonetta has no will or desires beyond what her creators attribute to her.  If we were talking about an actual woman here, I&#x27;d agree completely:  but we&#x27;re talking about a fictional character who uses magic.  Critiquing characters and critiquing people are two very different things.  As a counterpoint:  I&#x27;d argue that characters like &quot;He Man&quot; (or many other male superheroes) or those in &quot;Magic Mike&quot; are a male equivalent and just as unrealistic.<p>> This is a small example, however every time it&#x27;s brought up it&#x27;s immediately shut down by popular feminist voices.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of things like this getting shut down except in cases where its brought up as a bit of a red herring to distract from another debate.  I&#x27;m not aware of any feminist voices that have literally said &quot;Male teachers who assault their students should go to jail for a longer period of time&quot;--In fact I think the general feminist critical theory perspective would be that patriarchal ideas about sex (i.e. that men always want it, etc.) contribute to lower than deserved prison sentences for female teachers who abuse male students.  What was the context for this getting brought up and &quot;immediately shut down&quot;?",1437792893

The themes are what gets a user to use WordPress in the first place, because it solves a real world problem (examples: you need a portfolio site, you need an urban bar site or you need a real estate site).<p>- That said the quality of WordPress themes can be terrible. They can have conflicting plugins or terrible security holes. So the quality of the developer base is uneven at best (quite a few script kiddies).<p>- WordPress still feels like it&#x27;s stuck in the year 2008. The usability has only grown more complex, yet the functionality feels stuck in the web 2.0 era.<p>- Automattic is not a unicorn, in fact I feel that it&#x27;s doomed. Right now the open web feels like it&#x27;s in deep trouble, and WordPress just isn&#x27;t mobile first platform. This should have their management in panic mode, but it does not.<p>- For example there should be a way to wrap a WordPress site into an app. Yes there are third party solutions that do this, but Automattic should be doing that. In fact WordPress should have done that in say 2010.<p>- There are also a number of third party plugins that allow you to create a web page sort of like InDesign, but they&#x27;re all terrible hacks. Again this is something that Automattic should do, but doesn&#x27;t.<p>- Even the branding of WordPress is a convoluted mess. I find myself time and time again explaining the difference between WordPress.com and self hosting the software itself.<p>So in the end you have a product that is too complex for a normal person (this is why squarespace or facebook pages do well) yet it&#x27;s a platform that tech people feel is a bit of an old hack.<p>But what&#x27;s sad to me is that this feels like a reflection of the dead end that the open web has become.",1437789844

The game played out where one person was randomly chosen as the main contestant who answered trivia questions. If they failed a question they were booted.<p>The kicker to the game was, 100 other randomly selected players were playing against you answering the same questions. If they got it wrong, and the contestant got it right they were eliminated and the contestant continued.<p>The goal of the main contestant was to outlast the 100 players, and the more they outlasted the better prizes (usually MS Points) they won. The goal of the 100 was to outlast the main contestant to also win prizes (usually less than the main).<p>All other players watching the game could participate for fun and play along for no reward. It was actually pretty fun and the events all happened live with an announcer and everything.",1437789631

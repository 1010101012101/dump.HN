Author is comparing syntax, froth; no actual productive parts of web development is discussed.<p>I have written web apps in Common Lisp for 2-3 years, and in Java (with Play! Framework) for a year now: routes, templates and form submission are the most <i>standardized</i> parts of all framworks. My Lisp code to do those things is identical to the way it's done in Java.<p>If you want to compare web frameworks start by comparing their database & Model substrates: ORM, migrations, validation .. those are where you will become unstuck.

3914065,comment,3908964,3911953,3,0,Steuard,,,"Here's some napkin math on the black hole argument. Information is essentially equivalent to entropy: the entropy S = k * log M, where k is Boltzmann's constant and log M is the number of bits encoding the information. Now, it turns out to be <i>fundamentally</i> impossible to store more entropy in any region of space than would be contained in a black hole of the same size: S_max = (k A c^3)/(4 G hbar), where A is the ""surface area"" of the region, c is the speed of light, G is Newton's gravitational constant, and hbar is Planck's constant. That means the maximum number of bits of information in a region of space is (A c^3)/(4 G hbar), or about A * (10^69 1/m^2). Our solar system is maybe 1 light year in size: about 10^16 m, so its ""surface area"" is 4pi r^2 ~ 10^33 m^2. That means that the solar system can hold at most 10^102 bits of information.<p>If Moore's law says that computer memory doubles in capacity every 2 years, then they'll go up by a factor of 1000 about every 20 years. We currently have computers that hold about 10^12 bits of information, so just 90*20 = 1800 years would get up to that absolute limit, regardless of what technology we used, unless our single computer was bigger than a light year in radius.",1335877019

I used it most when I was working to have music on in the background, but if I wanted to participate I was constantly tending to my playlist. Not sure <i>how</i> to fix something like this.<p>- No way to explore music outside of going into rooms. It would have been great if they had a ""Top 200"" tracks or a way to browse genres (just add in an option when you create a room to select a genre and have other for the fringe categories).<p>- Saving music sucked. Yes, I could save stuff to other services, but the experience of doing so was daunting. For example, I love Last.FM, but taking me to the song page of the track that's playing on Last.FM is pretty weak. Why not stronger API integration? I heard a lot of music that I would have loved to put into a list, but the functionality wasn't there.<p>- Becoming a DJ in any room with a decent crowd was damn near impossible. People would hover over their mouse to get that coveted slot. If I started my own room, you'd only get a handful of people to come in. The point here I guess is that it would have been nice to have some better promotional tools so people could discover different stuff. Sorry, but I don't want to listen to dubstep all day. Woh woh woh wee woh.<p>Easy fix: fix your features and add in some cool stuff. Send me an email or two telling me to check out something useful (not ""we added in Facebook!"").

3913987,comment,3913182,3913182,5,0,agentultra,,,"I've heard core Python developers tell people not to worry about getting a module into the stdlib. The problem being that once the module is there it won't be able to change much. APIs have the exact same problem. If you change it, you're changing other peoples' software. Tight coupling.<p>Is it a terrible way to write software? Maybe... but perhaps that's a different discussion.<p>I think the requests library is amazing. It has a much more simple API than urllib/urllib2. Does it need to replace those modules in the stdlib? I hope not!<p>There are only three reasons I would write a module/package that depended solely on stdlib:<p><pre><code>  1. The module/package would be distributed primarily through package management systems.

  2. The installation of my module needs to avoid depending on anything else outside of a base python installation.

  3. The module or package will need to be supported for a long time and will likely not be updated frequently.
</code></pre>
The first case is because you can't control what versions of third-party libraries the package manager will make available. Some might run your setuptools script while others may not. It's just easier to live with the cruft/warts of the stdlib and be sure that they'll always be there.<p>The second case covers a very unique situation. Modules and libraries written with this constraint are typically targeting one of two different kinds of developers. The first are the beginners who may not know about development environments and versioning. The other are experienced developers who want a minimalist script for their little one-off utility. Both should require zero dependency installation if possible.<p>The final case is harder to define up front. If you're writing something that you expect to run for a long time and receive little maintenance (ie: cron scripts, tools, etc) then you don't want to deal with API updates breaking your code. Fire and forget is what a long-term stable API gets you.",1335875539

Patients easily fall into relapse needing multiple episodes of treatment. Rate of relapse is high enough to be concerned, if the treatment is left in between or patient does not comply with the treatment for required period. Hence repeated treatments may be required to prevent relapses and increase effectiveness of the treatment. If a treatment program is designed as per requirement of an individual addict and has a holistic approach, it will definitely prove fruitful and effective. Few things should be taken care while choosing a treatment plan for a drug addict. If these things are considered they prove helpful in recovery of the addict and help him to live normally further in his life.<p>There is no appropriate method of treatment that suits every drug addict. Every drug addict has different root causes for his addiction and needs individualistic treatment for his rehabilitation purpose. There are different methods and approach for treatment of drug addiction and used as per every individual addicts requirement. Some addicts may need more than one method of treatment simultaneously or one by one.
The treatment method used for rehabilitation of the drug addicted should be readily available. If it is difficult to avail or implement the treatment method then it loses its purpose and increases risk of relapse during treatment.
A proper and effective treatment for drug addiction is not only focused at catering to solve the drug addiction but it also tries to reach out to fulfill multiple needs of the individual patient. It tries to fulfil his or her emotional and social needs through a holistic approach so that the root cause of addiction is curbed out.
It is not possible to device a treatment plan once and stick to it till the end of treatment. The needs of individual addict change with treatment and time. Thus it is important that the treatment and approach of services plan is assessed time to time and modified to suit the patients changing needs.
Another important thing is that the addict remains in treatment for an adequate period of time. If an addict leaves the treatment in between, chances of relapse increase. For effective and efficient treatment, an addict should comply with the treatment for the required period of time.
Treatment Programs for addiction should also provide for assessment of other chronic disease, which could be a result of the drug addiction. Patients should also be provided with proper counselling to cope with them and to make life style changes to avoid other infections and diseases.
Treatment of drug addiction is a time consuming task. Patients are highly prone of relapses, thus they need continuous care till they fully get rid of their addiction. They may need multiple episodes of treatment and multiple methods or approach of treatment for their full recovery.
Some addicts may suffer mental disorders alongside their addiction problems. For those patients treatment must incorporate treatment for both the problems in an integrated way.
Treatment through drugs is not the complete treatment program. It is the first stage in treatment. For long term effect on drug use counselling and other behavioral therapies are also important. All these together make a comprehensive treatment program.
Some addicts may have compulsory need of medicines alongside other psychological methods for complete treatment of their condition. Some may be treated with psychological therapies only. It depends on the extent of addiction and patients needs.
There is a notion that if an addict voluntarily gets ready for treatment only then treatment could be effective. It is not true. If a patient is forced or brought by somebody else for treatment, even then he could respond well after few sessions of treatment and treatment could prove effective at the end.
Continuous monitoring during treatment of drug addiction is quite important as addicts are highly prone to relapses.

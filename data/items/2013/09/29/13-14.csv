6465187,comment,6463394,6464767,5,0,gillianseed,,,">CentOS and MariaDB come to mind as two possible examples, that started as a means not to pay for the original projects<p>Well neither CentOS or MariaDB came to be because of &#x27;asking for donations&#x27;. CentOS was forked from RHEL to be a subscription-free enterprise alternative and IS actually being funded by donations, which they ask for.<p>MariaDB is a fork created by the same person who created and then sold MySQL to Sun for $1 billion (which he was able to do due to MySQL having copyright attribution from all contributors).<p>I think these were at best very poor examples to support your statement.<p>>While it is very convenient for the users, it does not guarantee that you as the author will get paid to work on it.<p>True, it will be a competitive situation, however it&#x27;s not very different from proprietary commercial development as you will need to continue to add features and improve performance etc, else users will turn to another application which does.<p>In open source it&#x27;s extremely easy to fork (ie base upon existing code) however due to copyleft it won&#x27;t be a fork with exclusive lock-in features as anything can be ported back, so in essence the payment will go to the person/persons who the end users think is providing the best value for their payment, again not unlike proprietary commercial development.<p>And in the tradition of open source software, I see no direct reason as for why developers can&#x27;t consider sharing development and thus also the donations.<p>>The Android market is a prime example of this, where lots of apps are just plain forks, with the original authors getting nothing in return.<p>Well I think that is primarily a problem of original developers not creating Android versions of their open source applications to begin with, as such we are seeing opportunistic third-party developers creating quick ports of their software.<p>But is that really a bad thing? If the original programmers aren&#x27;t interested in supporting the Android platform and someone else provides the service then I fail to see the harm (assuming of course that the licence is abided).<p>And I do think that when official projects enter the market place they will quickly gain the upper hand over third-party ports as not only are they again the &#x27;official&#x27; version, but also I trust that they as core developers can typically adapt the original code better for Android use.<p>I also think we are slowly seeing more official Android ports of well known open source desktop software, VLC comes to mind.<p>Looking past whats already been discussed I&#x27;m sure there are viable venues which haven&#x27;t yet been thought of, or at least given a fair chance.<p>One thing I forgot to highlight was the Valve Steam Workshop donation program which just recently resulted in enough money for two 6 month development contracts for working on Blender.<p>Again things like this makes me believe that exposure and ease of payment is the big hurdle, not that there&#x27;s not enough people willing to donate for open software development.",1380463025

6465175,comment,6464261,6464932,3,0,dexen,,,"You have somehow re-defined software engineer performance as a mere function of company bottom-line, and ended up measuring performance of individual software developers by proxy of long-term company performance. There are two problems with it.<p>First, not all software engineers actually do commercially work on commercial software -- as a quick example, Con Kolivas, who is an anaesthesiologist by day and kernel hacker in spare time. Others may work on commerical software by themselves, without any external team or management involved; think Colin Percival. I would even wager a guess that some of the best software was created in a non-commercial way, say, Linux kernel -- at least the early versions of it.<p>Second, the impact any software engineer has on company bottom line is much affected by other aspects of a company. In a symbolic notation, you could say:<p><pre><code>  BOTTOMLINE_IMPACT := RISK_MANAGEMENT(SALES(TEAM_MANAGEMENT(THE_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER(EXISTING_CODEBASE)))).\n</code></pre>\nInvoking the Amdahl&#x27;s law -- even if you had a 10x SOFTWARE_DEVELOPER, performance of the whole system will be limited by the other factors. In my limited experience, the RISK_MANAGEMENT (of software development and use) part is the least understood one those days.",1380462755

6465161,comment,6464974,6464974,8,0,EliRivers,,,"To be honest, they&#x27;ll be lucky. I have some knowledge of the UK reserve forces, and right now there is a massive attempt to recruit as the government tries to switch its defence manning policy in a very, very short time. Unlike the US and Australia and various other modern forces (which have a much greater proportion of reserve forces), the UK has until very recently has a relatively small reserve forces. It&#x27;s common in the US and other such for reserve forces to be part of the routine planning and deployment for operations; the UK has only recently been forced to think like this, principally due to the manning issues encountered in the Middle East over the last decade.<p>Fifteen years ago (maybe even ten years ago, depending on which reserve force one joined), you could join the UK reserve forces and the general feeling was that one could easily go a few decades without being mobilised; now, people are told on joining to expect to be mobilised - it&#x27;s routine.<p>The US is a very warlike society, with a significant civilian buy-in to the idea of the armed forces and reserve forces. The UK, whilst as a nation just as busy travelling around the world to meet interesting people and shoot at them, does not have nearly such a civilian buy-in; there are already rumblings that reservists are just less attractive to employers on the grounds that they can be expected to disappear for nine months, and the employer is forced to hold their job open for them. This is clearly a big concern for the government, because they&#x27;re trying to push the idea that employing a reservist brings advantages. Many employers seem... dubious that losing someone for nine months is worth the less tangible benefits.<p>Some reserve forces are being asked to increase on the order of 50% in about 5 years; given that in the UK it can take three years (and sometimes more - five years isn&#x27;t unheard of; I understand that in some nations, reservists might spend several weeks or even months doing all the initial training in a single block; that simply won&#x27;t work in the UK unless civilian attitude to reservists undergoes a massive change) to take a new reserve recruit and make them deployable (on the &quot;trained strength&quot; as the vernacular goes) this is one hell of a recruitment target.<p>The network infrastructure reservist branches are still in their infancy; in the British navy reserve, the branch is very, very new. They are still working out just what they&#x27;re about. The kind of IT professional I anticipate they&#x27;ll be trying to recruit will almost certainly feel a bit ripped off to be exercising their years of experience (for which, as contractors, they probably charge up to a hundred a day) on initial pay which, as I recall, is around 40 UKP a day, before tax etc. The initial basic training and militarisation can easily take a couple of years anyway, before they even start thinking about branching, so this might be something of a hard sell; &quot;join us, and spend two years slogging around fields in the mud, and eventually we&#x27;ll use your civilian skills at a much lower rate of pay than you get for them in your day job&quot;. Given that one of the main selling points of the reserve forces in the UK is that you get to do something a bit different, this is going to be a very hard sell.",1380462162

Companies like Google came to us with a deal: give us your email business, and we&#x27;ll provide it for free -- as long as we can mine the data to serve you ads. That&#x27;s how we&#x27;ll get paid.<p>But that was bullshit -- and I don&#x27;t think it was the fault of the companies involved. The problem is, once you start instrumenting the internet, <i>every activity you take online is part of some massive surveillance mechanism directed at your personal life</i>. What started as a simple transaction between you and Google, or you and your ISP, now can involve any other organization that can get that information from those companies.<p>Sure, some companies are vehement about protecting your privacy, but with governments involved, it doesn&#x27;t matter. They run the show. Also, this is a &quot;weakest link&quot; problem. Even if Google and 90% of all the other companies you deal with have some technical way of keeping others from your data, but as along as the other 10% is compromised, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Keystroke readers defeat just about anything. Trans-Atlantic wiretaps allow governments of all sizes a fun playground full of data.<p>So the real deal isn&#x27;t what these companies offered. It&#x27;s more like &quot;use the internet, and we&#x27;ll track you like an animal. We&#x27;ll know where you go, what opinions you have, what you eat, who your friends are, and lots more. And we&#x27;ll keep that information forever&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not an acceptable deal.

The new regs for 2014 are for a smaller engine, supplemented by larger KERS, pushing for fuel efficiency. Long term, I see that trend continuing. Burning up shed loads of fossil fuels to merely race will get more and more difficult while normal car drivers and manufacturers have to deal with efficiency. F1 will evolve in the electric direction.<p>That is not to even begin to suggests FE is a waste of time or anything like that. I&#x27;m massively looking forward to it, might even allow the word &quot;excited&quot;. Much of it will run in the F1 off season. It can run in any major world city resulting in potentially fantastic visuals. I really like that you can hear the tyres working. All you hear now is engine, and that actually doesn&#x27;t tell you much about the driver. Hearing the tyres tells us a lot more. For me FE is a fascinating supplement to F1 which could or should help F1 get more electric. Both technology wise, and in the PR battle with olde skool F1 fans. It can prove electric racing works.<p>Equally, there are parts of FE that I don&#x27;t like, but mostly they are things that will evolve and be solved over time, like the car swap thing, or PR type things like the social media voting for boosts nonsense. But the basic idea of trying to create an electric open wheel racing series is fundamentally right. I really hope it can gain enough traction to keep going.<p>Actually, a final thought. I might be completely wrong...<p>There is a chance that FE, if run and marketed right could be made to appeal to the Need for Speed generation. Run races at night. Bright lights ever where; scenery, under-lighting on the cars and all that glitz. Lots of music, and off track entertainment. Get game/software developers, ICE manufacturers, and the likes of Red Bull involved. Make it all look like a Fast and Furious race night, or X games events. Go heavy youth, apps, social media, and so on. Make sure it&#x27;s on free TV with cool youth friendly presenters hyping it all up. If it gains a following from the ground up, it could become incredibly popular.<p>So, essentially forget F1 and F1 fans. In fact, I wonder if the mistake is the open wheel F1 look a like thing, which draws unhelpful comparisons. Maybe they&#x27;d be better off racing electric cars that at least resemble the kind of cars you can buy? Electric chassis with light bodies resembling current road cars?<p>Dunno. But whatever the case, Im in. I&#x27;ll probably always watch F1 (not to mention many other racing series) for better or worse, but FE is very much a welcome addition for me.",1380460991

It&#x27;s also the first flight for the fairing, which has to hold together against high Mach-number winds and then cleanly fall off on command.  (It doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but there have been several launches that lost payloads due to fairing problems.

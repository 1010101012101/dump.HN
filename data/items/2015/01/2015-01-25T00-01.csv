If you look at the total fumbles, the patriots are #1 but only 7 ahead of #2.  The two worst teams are 10 behind the next two teams.  I didn&#x27;t run the numbers, but eyeballing it, it seems like the Patriots are pretty easily within a couple standard deviations there.",1422147488

8941678,comment,8940411,8941098,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"Climate change is a funny topic in part because some elements on the far Left (represented by Naomi Klein, for example) want to use it as a lever to justify the kind of radical social engineering that failed so spectacularly and murderously and repeatedly throughout the 20th century, and the far Right have decided that to fight the politics they have to fight the science.<p>This has resulted in a situation where the Left, who abandoned science decades ago, pretend to care about it, while the Right--which has long had an ambivalent relationship with reality--has decided to go full-post-modern and construe all facts as pure social constructs, which is exactly what the Left has been saying for a long time.<p>Almost none of the discussion of &quot;climate science&quot; in the public sphere has anything to do with science, and if you&#x27;re an actual scientist with relevant expertise and you say anything about the science you will get beaten up by both sides.<p>As a computational physicist I&#x27;ve given my opinion on occasion that climate models are non-physical and therefore non-predictive, no matter how well-tuned they are to past climate (because only the correct physics can extrapolate the past forward, and the unphysical approximations in climate models are not small in the relevant sense.) What climate models do show fairly convincingly is that we are increasing the Earth&#x27;s heat budget by 1.6 W/m<i></i>2 or so, which is in the range of 0.5% overall, and this is plausibly a very bad thing.<p>So because I criticize climate models the Left attacks me as a denialist, and the Right embraces me as one, whereas I&#x27;m actually saying the models give a pretty decent reason to take some fairly mundane steps, like implementing carbon taxes and tariffs. The &quot;tariff&quot; part is important because it exports the cost of emissions to other jurisdictions. At this point the Right attacks me as being a socialist taxer (because taxes are socialist?) and the Left attacks me for not wanting to &quot;change everything&quot; (because that always works so well.)<p>There simply isn&#x27;t any science in the &quot;climate science&quot; debate. It&#x27;s all politics.",1422147373

8941671,comment,8941564,8941564,0,0,thisguychicity,,,"I always recommend that entrepreneurs form a company before they build a product.  Everyone needs some equity up front for the work done to date.  This equity is given in exchange for the company to take ownership of all the technology built today.  The rest needs to be allocated to everyone (even you) on a vesting schedule.  The end goal being that after the vest period the equity is evenly distributed.  Vesting schedules have cliffs that distribute shares.  Typically I recommend a 5 year vesting schedule with 12 month cliffs.  If someone works for 11 months and vanishes you don&#x27;t owe them any of the unvested equity in the business.  If they leave after 1 year and three months they only vested the first year of equity on the schedule.<p>The issue at hand is that none of these roles is ever really done.  It&#x27;s very likely that someone will up and vanish for one reason or another while the company is being built and the remaining founders will have to bring someone else in and offer them equity to pickup where the previous person left off.  Ensure you have take with and come with provisions for the protection of all shareholders.<p>Details:  I would form the company as a corporation in Delaware with more shares allocated than distributed.  Base your vesting schedule off of the shares allocated and not the possible number of shares distributed.  This gives you the ability to sell shares to investors without having to pay a lawyer again in the future.<p>Source: Done this a few times and sold two companies in the last six years.<p>Me - <a href=""http://www.strapr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.strapr.com</a> - happy to provide more advice if you want some, my email is on there.<p>Disclaimer: I am not an attorney and this is not to be construed as legal advice, you should seek counsel for your needs.",1422147236

Rural Wyoming is by no means short of land, but it&#x27;s dry, desolate, windblown, and hundreds of miles from any regions with, say, hospitals, or airports, or actual grocery stores, or land that can grow something other than grass, or other frivolities of modern living. The fact that land is divided up into huge ranches is, therefore, not a huge loss for people looking for a little spread of their own; the only way the land could possibly be economically productive is in those huge ranches. A lot of it&#x27;s owned by the Federal government, as well.<p>So it&#x27;s trivially supply-and-demand, and the fact is the US, at least, has a huge supply of land for which there is essentially no demand. It&#x27;s been allocated about as efficiently as it&#x27;s going to be. Canada has a similar situation. Does that mean we&#x27;re <i>not</i> short on land? Technically, perhaps not, but realistically, if the land is effectively unlivable, it might as well not exist for our purposes.<p>On the gripping hand everyone has a different definition of &#x27;livable&#x27;, even to the point of some people being willing to live in rehabbed ICBM silos in the wilds of North Dakota.",1422146045

8941545,comment,8940820,8940820,0,0,calinet6,,,"An extremely good primer on quality at the organizational level. Even if it&#x27;s your &quot;job&quot; to make quality products, the visibly rewarded metrics are often counter to the desired result.<p>The assumed management strategy is to individualize results, punish poor behavior (often directly related to errors or defects) and reward perceived good behavior (&quot;hard work&quot;) at an individual level. In reality, this causes a complex wash of quality-undermining behavior: politics, infighting, de-motivation, perceived unfairness, and worse. Despite the well-proven and scientifically understood reality, managers and even employees are entrenched in the surface level, when in reality the problems are deeper and higher level.<p>This is the wisdom of W. Edwards Deming and his contemporaries. The fundamental epiphany is that quality is the result of <i>how companies are managed.</i> That it is a result of four things: an understanding of knowledge itself (primarily, that our prior assumptions about work are incorrect) -- an understanding of psychology (behavioral science and real motivation) -- knowledge of statistics (for the ability to optimize process, and the knowledge that all behavior has a random element, even that of individuals) -- and finally, a deep understanding of systems and their effects.<p>This thinking brought Japan out of its post-WWII recession. It was the origin of the Japanese quality economy—of Toyota, Honda, Sony, Panasonic, and more Japanese companies with quality products at the core of their success. The Deming prize is still given to companies which embody the values of quality.<p>It worked in Japan because of a cultural readiness for a systemic worldview. It does not gain traction in the US for exactly the opposite reason: we are a culture of rugged individualists, who, despite scientifically proven truth, will not drop our core idea that individuals are the cause of both our successes and our failures. This is especially true for upper management.<p>To be successful, as companies and as a nation, we need a major cultural shift toward systematic quality. We need companies that understand that most of the deficit in the quality of products comes not from poor individuals themselves, but poor links between them, poor management of them, and the poor systems within which they work. Simply lack of attention to systems and process in general causes a standard of organizational chaos, where we truly do rely on the excellence of individuals to keep companies afloat. This is familiar to all of us, but surely there&#x27;s a better way.<p>If every &quot;whose fault is it&quot; question would be translated to &quot;what, at its core, caused this fault&quot;—every company would benefit—and that&#x27;s true even if some fault can be found with an individual. Display extreme restraint, as the better course of action is <i>still</i> systemic. And this isn&#x27;t a strategy of simply &quot;blaming management&quot;—instead, every person in the company needs to work together to improve the system surrounding them, and when every person understands why that view is important and why they&#x27;re a part of it, then the improvement will begin to multiply.<p>This is true in software as it is in manufacturing, and I think the industry is ready for a new body of work to translate Deming&#x27;s ideas to the software field. Skip Six Sigma, skip TQM—too dogmatic and heavy. Focus on Deming&#x27;s core ideas: the importance of systems, understanding of key underlying concepts, and the implementation of them with good leadership from the top. It&#x27;s a new old way, it is a better way, and we need it now.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming</a>",1422144047

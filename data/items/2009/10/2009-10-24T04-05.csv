900131,comment,900086,900086,0,0,vessenes,,,"I completely agree with this article. I'm a successful entrepreneur with an Ivy degree, and I've spent a lot of time with Entrepreneurs from around the world. A surprising number didn't go to a 'top-tier' school; by surprising, I mean to say that where I live if you throw a brick at a law firm, marketing agency, publisher, or accounting firm, you will hit a bunch of Ivy grads. If you throw a brick at a successful startup-CEO meet-and-greet, you will hit a bunch of immigrant kids, local 'townies', and 1 time in 15, someone with an MBA, (usually from a top school.) This is so prevalent that at a recent dinner I had with a highly successful real-estate developer, I was shocked to learn that he went to Harvard. I expected him to be a local non-Ivy grad, given his huge self-made business success.<p>I've come to a similar conclusion that the author of the article does: risk-aversion is real, and prevalent for Ivy grads. This is probably for a mix of reasons -- I could imagine wealthy students not 'needing' the success as much, and poor ones saddled with loans which make risking much harder. I started out in a risk-averse career, management consulting, but I just couldn't hack the lifestyle and people, and left to do something that was crazy and eventually much more lucrative.",1256360181

In the beginning both are simple, but if you weave that simple assumption into the code, it will be hard to add finer grained control.<p>* Keep read latency low.  This might mean some form of caching.  Twiki is slow in my experience.<p>* Expose all features to a web service interface from day one.  Don't weld functionality to the GUI.  Side benefit: makes testing your software easier.

900126,comment,899862,899988,0,0,vessenes,,,"1) I suggest that actually the largest-grossing games will be things that run inside of some sort of trusted computing-y system. Right now, the 360 and PS3 fill that role, especially the 360, with its really-pretty-good internal verification systems. I suppose Steam could turn into a setup like that as well. I note MS also pushes the server-side hard, like you suggest, and I agree this has added significant value to their games,making offline play less appealing.<p>2) Agreed completely, this is happening now, a-la D&D Online. As companies figure out how to forecast revenues from such things, we'll be seeing a lot of this. And, frankly, I think a lot of us won't mind. I kind of like pay-as-you go, personally. It lets me choose how much to spend on the game.<p>p.s. I love my Kindle.",1256359551

He said his app was up about 40 minutes after launch on a pirate site. I get the impression that what you download from Cydia rewrites the system calls, once for all, and does not rewrite each app internally. These apps are distributed binary, yes? So you're going to need a cracker with a disassembler, iphone dev kit and some time to pull out the internal checks. This opposed to doing it once for all on the iphone OS side. I'm betting that's how it's done, and if that's how it's done, then adding those checks will have some impact.",1256359150

Then again, I used it in an iterative fashion, do something simple -S, do the same thing -S -O1, -S -O2, -S O3, and then a spattering of the different optimization techniques to see how it converted the C to assembly.

900113,comment,899639,899639,0,0,jerf,,,"I find that it has greatly improved my sense of direction. I live in an area where the roads are not always a grid (to put it lightly... having lots of lakes is fun for everyone but the civil engineers), and the GPS device has helped me correct my mental map of my area (which I am also relatively new to) several times now where I was off by as much as 30 or 60 degrees in what direction I thought I was going. (Between trees, clouds, and the fact that you probably shouldn't be staring at the sun while driving, if it weren't out-of-view most of the time anyhow, I find most conventional absolute cues to be useless.)<p>I suspect that rather than being an absolute problem, it has more to do with how you use it. Using it exclusively in turn-by-turn mode, such that it never displays any context beyond the next turn, is probably a bad idea. Using it zoomed out so it shows the surrounding half-mile or so (or more on highways) is what I find helpful. I never wanted to find alternate routes to things before because you just never know what on earth a road is going to do without a map (dead end? immediately shoot off in the wrong direction? who knows?), and the GPS unit is a map convenient enough to actually use. Even when I use it to travel to areas I've never been to, it helps me strongly orient myself and learn the 'lay of the land' in a way that simply driving once through an area, following your host to some specific place, really can't. It's like having psychic knowledge of the area you're in.",1256358552
900111,comment,899745,900036,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"I've heard good things about MVC, unfortunately I've been a little hesitant with exploring it. I worked with classic ASP for the first few years at my last job, before we started transitioning to ASP.NET and while I know websites really are (and should be) stateless, I've kind of grown accustomed to how ASP.NET works.<p>I suppose it boils down to the fact that there are so many technologies out there right now that it's almost overwhelming and I'm more comfortable with sticking what I know, and what's kept me employed. Still, MVC is something that I may look into as some point. The fact that it works so splendidly with jQuery is definitely enticing. I'm loving jQuery lately.",1256358522

(Can't find that article right now unfortunately, it was quite good - it was referencing a fantasy story where fire didn't exist in a parallel world)<p>Anyway, paper is worth a read. People with an adept knowledge of physics will chuckle a little, but probably even better for people like me who haven't played with physics much - got me thinking about center of mass, density, inertia, etc. Interesting stuff.

Admittedly I didn't have much experience working with other companies in this fashion (outsourcing), but I can't commend them enough on their work. We had face to face meetings and conference calls for what was probably 3 months before they even got started so that they had a very solid understanding of what we needed. The had very detailed project outlines, timeframes, etc, etc. All the stuff I would imagine a legitimate and professional shop would have, but it was so amazing to me because of the processes we had in house that were drastically different.<p>Heck, they even set me up with a Virtual Machine, VPN and VSS access to the project on their network so I could actually get in there and help them on certain aspects. Setting up the VPN actually required them to reconfiguring their entire network due to IP conflicts and they did so without complaint. Just a real great group of people to work with.",1256358060

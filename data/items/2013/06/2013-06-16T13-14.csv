5888453,comment,5888247,5888247,1,0,justinschuh,,,"Ignoring the dubious baseline assumption that your data really is at risk of exposure, why do you think what you&#x27;re proposing would make you safer rather than put you at more risk? You still need to actually home your servers somewhere, which means a colo or VPS that is subject to the exact same laws. Do you expect the providers of those services to have the capability to fight such requests better than Google, given that Google has a full time legal team dedicated to doing so? What about the basic security of the provider itself? Do you really expect that to be anywhere near the level of what Google provides on its own systems? To top it all off, there&#x27;s the maintenance and securing of whatever you&#x27;re actually running, which requires significant expertise and takes quite a bit of time if you don&#x27;t want your box popped and turned into a zombie host (which is what is most likely to happen).<p>I&#x27;ve actually done what you&#x27;re proposing for several years, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. And I&#x27;m a well respected security professional with the right background who knows all the tricks I&#x27;m supposed to do. It was still a huge pain and time sink, which meant I often let patches and updates slide more than I should. The real cherry on top is that all the three different colo/VPS providers I&#x27;ve used were hacked at one point or another, causing disclosure of my personal data and significant outages of my ability to communicate.<p>My point here is that you&#x27;re not being honest with yourself if you really think you can manage this as a side project better than the full-time teams at Google do. If you want to pick another provider of email, etc, then investigate carefully and find one you&#x27;re happy with. But I&#x27;d strongly discouraging running your own services.",1371391075

Other comments have dealt with these numbers already.<p>Anyway, to my point. I see no reason why new technology and interconnectedness is going to lead to the decline of the western city.

CSEC is prohibited by law from directing its foreign intelligence activities at Canadians anywhere in the world or at any person in Canada. In addition, there are rigorous procedures in place to ensure that it adheres to this prohibition.<p>The Ministerial Directive on Metadata clearly defines metadata and specifies that CSEC may only collect and use metadata in support of its foreign intelligence and cyber-protection mandate. For intelligence purposes, CSEC uses metadata to isolate and identify foreign communications and foreign targets. The Ministerial Directive also outlines strict conditions to protect the privacy of Canadians. Under the National Defence Act, CSEC is mandated to provide technical and operational assistance to law enforcement and security agencies in the performance of their lawful duties.<p>All CSEC and law enforcement and security agencies’ activities are strictly bound by the limits of their lawful duties, including court warrants. Under such circumstances, CSEC activities are subject to review by an independent CSE Commissioner who is responsible for reviewing CSEC activities to ensure that all CSEC activities comply with the law and protect the privacy of Canadians. All information acquired under the warrant belongs to the assisted agency.<p>CSEC does not target the communications of Canadians anywhere and has legislative measures in place to protect the privacy of Canadians. As the CSE Commissioner noted in his 2011-2012 report, the focus of CSEC activity is foreign intelligence. In this report, the CSE Commissioner highlights that all reviewed CSEC activities were authorized and carried out in accordance with the law.

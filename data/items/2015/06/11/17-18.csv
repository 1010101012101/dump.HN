9701258,comment,9698870,9700352,0,0,Confusion,,,"I don&#x27;t understand why people believe &#x27;everyone&#x27; should be able to write code without much trouble. Virtually every activity requires focus and exercise to learn. Example: you can&#x27;t just take a hammer and start building furniture or you will create a mess. If you want something nice and useful, you need to think about what you want to build, how you are going to construct it, which materials you need, which tools you need. You need to experience how the materials behave, try out certain subconstructions, research what specialized tools exist. I believe this idea that &#x27;everyone&#x27; should be able to code is like expecting everyone to be able to build furniture. If you want to, you can learn how to build furniture, but it&#x27;s not easy and will never be easy. Why would coding be any different?",1434045557

9701230,comment,9699283,9699283,0,0,gtk40,,,"I went through a big interview spree after finishing my undergraduate degree this spring. I have one company that I was very excited about potentially working for. The job description was for a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; with no particular tools listed, but wanted experience with some things like databses, web apps, and so forth. I had worked several days a week during my senior year at a .NET shop (now working here full time temporarily until my next job starts), including some ASP.NET MVC and some other web-related work.<p>I put a section on my resume under education with relevant coursework. I noted there that I had taken a database course as part of my CS cousework and put &quot;Databases (primarily MySQL with interfaces in PHP and JS),&quot; as about 90% of the project-related courework involved using MySQL databases with web-based interfaces.<p>In the inital phone interview, I had a nice chat and talked about some of my former projects, familiarity with other languages, where I made it known I was fairly comfortable in JavaScript and Python and some other language, and most of my professional/educational experience was in .NET and Java. He asked about the databases course and I explained what the curriculum went over and the final project. I explained all I had used PHP for was a few database calls and that I wasn&#x27;t very experienced with it.<p>Then, at the first technical interview, it was entirely in PHP. The interviewer mentioned it at the start, and I explained my level of familiarity (very little). It was asking about how specific data types behave in PHP, global variables, differences in PHP 4 and 5, and was entirely about PHP. I did my best, assuming wrongly about things like global variables, and so on. I never got a call back.<p>I removed PHP and have since only listed the technologies in any way that I am ready to interview in.",1434045286

For example, if we all believed in a greater mission for our civilization, all our efforts would be focused on building space ships and space colonization, not wasting efforts in buying a bigger home, a newer car model, buying new fancy clothes, getting a crazy haircut, and so on. Yes, there are people who are not on the either extreme today, but these are not the majority. I am happy that geeks start to embrace minimalism, simplify life, and focus our limited seconds on this planet in something productive, but, again, we&#x27;re a minority.

In the sense that I live in a state with a large number of military bases/troops/persons who go into the military.  They come back from their deployments, they go back home, they join the local PD.  Some states have less of this than others.<p>Further, others have made this point, and I guess I was not as clear as I should have been, but in part, you only need one officer who&#x27;s a vet to come into the department and he says, &quot;When I was in Iraq, this is how we did it...&quot;  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a huge influence, but I do think it&#x27;s part of spreading the military culture that the original article is talking about.<p>Call it militarization of the police, hero worship, cargo-cult, whatever.

(Not knowing that it had a name, if that name was even coined back then.)<p>My thoughts on this go two-fold:\n1) When we see the same concept multiple times, it often has to do with things being trendy, and media looking to other media for coverage.  Other than breaking news, most publications publish iterative rather than totally original content.  Even when a thing is not super trending, you can often find that multiple occurrences of the same concept have their root in the same origin.  Now that we publish on the web and that most writers aren&#x27;t greedy with crediting their stories&#x27; ancestors with backlinks, you can often tell that this has been the case.<p>2) Survivor bias. We are exposed to dozens of new concepts every day, many of which will linger on in our minds for a few days or weeks, depending on their salience. When we see a second occurrence, our brain creates a link/links with the previous one, and suddenly the original idea gains in salience in our mind along with the new one.  But what about the other 15 unique ideas that I was exposed to yesterday, the day before, and all other days before that?  They go on to be forgotten.  When one original concept re-appears from a different channel, we&#x27;re delighted, but really, this is all our brains do for a living, connecting things from disparate origins for what they have in common.  Nowadays I&#x27;m more upset at not being able to link more information to my existing mental super-structure than I&#x27;m excited at connecting things in the schema. :P",1434044665

Following the pro scene, you become really attached to individual players and teams - their unique personalities, skills, and the complex team-based strategy that the game calls for.<p>Unlike traditional sports, pro esports players are streaming frequently on twitch - you have much more direct contact to them. You can watch them playing in solo queue (i.e. in a non-professional environment, away from the rest of their team), and they&#x27;ll often joke around, talk to their viewers (who talk in a chat attached to the channel), and explain what they&#x27;re doing and their decision-making as they play the game.<p>So, you watch League of Legends because of the crazy plays that Faker makes, or the mind-blowing support mechanics of Madlife. You rooted for Dignitas because of how hilarious QTPie is on his stream, or maybe you&#x27;ve been following TSM since the Baylife days, standing by them when they falter and cheering madly when they make a showing in an international tournament. The Koreans have been dominant for years, but every year it feels like the NA teams are slowly inching closer in terms of skill. You go to a bar in San Francisco where they play matches live, and you&#x27;re surrounded by people who are just as passionate as you. On top of all of that, you have Riot Games, which has invested themselves entirely in building a sport, not just a game, and making fans feel like they&#x27;re valued and loved. Maybe you even have professional aspirations yourself - there&#x27;s a challenger circuit for the best amateur teams, that&#x27;s also run by Riot Games, where the best teams make it into the professional circuit. Playing professionally pretty much guarantees you six figures of income, from streaming and sponsorships.<p>So, people are into esports the same reason they&#x27;re into any sport.

I intend to, but as another comment calculated below, that will take around 127 minutes. This comment is simply about the beginning.<p>2. I&#x27;m not 100% certain yet what the intended goal of this article is, so I may just be off base. That being said, my criticisms should be interpreted more as questions, since I&#x27;m deeply fascinated with how to make programming more accessible. I hope they are taken as such, and people share their experiences/successes/failures in getting people to understand &quot;what we do&quot;. Again, like other commenters here I have suffered the fate of parents not really understanding what you do (unlike the even superficial understanding of what a physicist does).<p>3. People learn differently, this is me pretending to not know anything and reading this article. It is thus flawed on two axises: I can&#x27;t know for sure how I would have taken it in, and even if I did, it may be great for most people but bad for me.<p>All that being said, I had a few issues with this article(&#x27;s beginning) if the goal is to make programming seem understandable to non-programmers. It seems to jump around a lot at the beginning and focus on just how complex everything is. If the goal is &quot;programmers are justified in their work, look how complex everything they deal with is!&quot;, then this may be an OK approach. However, if the goal is to help them understand what we do day to day, it may not.<p>Some examples:<p>1. The early references to math. I once upon a time thought math was a pre-requisite to programming. I have now met enough awesome programmers that are absolute rubbish at math that I no longer believe that to be true. I believe referring to the &quot;math&quot; of things a lot scares people off (makes it seem like &quot;one of those math things math people do&quot; and inaccessible, when in reality your everyday programmer does not do a lot of (complex) math).<p>2. The early reference to circuits, compilation, and keyboard codes. This is a tremendous amount of scope that is unnecessary in my opinion, and just makes everything seem so obtuse. Showing keyboard codes goes a long way in conveying how much a computer does, but I feel is very confusing in relation to programming. I don&#x27;t deal with &quot;keyboard codes&quot;. We could also get into for example the actual hardware and how even having to deal with denouncing a key is hard! But I think everyone would see why that isn&#x27;t great for the (introduction) of a programming explanation.<p>3. The circuits I believe are pretty and let you do things interactively, but I have a hard time believing they convey any information to people not familiar with programming. No one knows what XOR means (which you can flip the gates to), and just furthers the idea that code is this weird incantation we do. More putting them in &quot;awe&quot; of programming than understanding it.<p>Then again, I&#x27;ve been criticized for relying to heavily on analogy. My explanation would probably start with a lot of hand waiving: &quot;lets tell the computer to get a sandwhich shall we?&quot;, then trying to get deeper bit by bit, etc. Others have probably tried this and failed, so I am genuinely curious if people walk away from this article feeling like they have a better understanding of things.",1434044502

Bear in mind, though, that Rust is manually memory managed, and there is significant cognitive overhead of having a compiler that checks that you&#x27;re doing the manual memory management properly as opposed to just using a GC.<p>I think if you want a really fast symbolic evaluation checker—say, the kind that you&#x27;re going to run on $BIG_COMPANY&#x27;s codebase on every checkin—Rust would be a really good fit, because you get pattern matching and excellent performance. Other than OCaml and (maybe?) F#, I don&#x27;t know of a language that has as sophisticated a pattern matcher as Rust does, which helps a lot with this stuff. But, if you&#x27;re building a one-off tool, a more dynamic language with a GC might be more convenient.",1434044000

9701012,comment,9698870,9698870,0,0,curun1r,,,"I would try to explain it as levels of abstraction and how they extend beyond the computers that execute the code. You can go down through the levels of abstraction, 1 by 1, until the point is made rather than attempting to start from the bottom and work up.<p>So, for example, when talking to the non-technical executive, the first level of abstraction is the technical expert that tries to explain complex technical issues. Below that, there might be a technical management layer that deals with technical issues on a more granular level, but still isn&#x27;t looking at the code. Below that there&#x27;s the actual developers who are writing code and are concerned with the actual logic the computer is executing. Below that are the framework authors that abstract away the common parts of writing an application of a certain type. Below that are the language platform authors who write compilers or interpreters that translate the code typed by the programmers into a format that either the computer or a lower-level abstraction (LLMV, etc) deals with. At this point, it&#x27;s probably not necessary to go any lower, but you can go all the way down to CPU/machine architecture level, if necessary.<p>The key point is that even highly-technical people have to trust the layers of abstraction below the point where they have full understanding. I&#x27;ve been coding for over 20 years and I still only have a cursory understanding of how my compiler is translating the code I write into machine code, let alone how the actual hardware that runs the code. I took EE courses in college and understand the theory, but the implementation by the folks at Intel and other hardware vendors is opaque to me and I&#x27;m forced to trust that it works.<p>The coders employed by your company may be able to dig into framework code, but the chances are that they&#x27;re fully trusting the runtimes that they work with. That trust may be the result of a well-earned reputation or through testing that the claims made by the language runtime are empirically true, but it&#x27;s still trusting something that they&#x27;re unequipped to verify themselves. This need to trust bubbles all the way up to senior management. The systems are just too complex for anyone concerned with the finished product to understand the whole picture.<p>That means that, as an executive, you&#x27;re likely trusting your senior technical leadership. The only way you avoid doing that is to dig in and better understand the abstraction layer they&#x27;re providing. You can also make that trust easier by doing the same sorts of things that a coder does with their language runtime...give tasks to your abstraction layer and test whether they&#x27;re completed successfully. And, when those tasks are not completed successfully, don&#x27;t accept techno-babble responses, dig in to understand the wheres and whys of where things broke down. Likely, the chain of trust of those abstraction layers was broken at some point...figure out where that point was so you can prevent it from happening again.<p>Every abstract layer adds uncertainty to the system. A CPU engineer can tell you how long a small task will take within a ns or so. A compiler engineer can tell you how many CPU cycles an expression will result in and compute an approximate time for a given processor within microseconds. And it continues as you go up the chain until you&#x27;re talking to senior management and he&#x27;s giving you swags with a margin of error of months. Understanding this goes a long way towards explaining the behaviors that are so confusing to the non-technical executive. It&#x27;s intimidating, but the good news is that many of the skills of a good manager are what&#x27;s necessary to achieve the necessary level of demystifying. The way that you begin to understand these layers of abstraction is through inquiry. Ask the right questions and, over time, you&#x27;ll understand more and more of how software development happens.",1434043229

Of all of the functional programming languages, OCaml has probably the most sophisticated pattern matching engine around (and we basically copied it into Rust, incidentally), supporting or-patterns, multiple bindings, guards, and so forth. Pattern matching lets you essentially match on the shape of subtrees of arbitrary data structures with complex predicates.<p>If you&#x27;re familiar with old-school compiler construction, this is like having a souped-up BURG built into the language. For example, pattern matching lets you say things like &quot;if I have Load(Var, Add(Var, Constant)) where constant is a small power of two, fold it into the x86 indexed addressing mode&quot; in one line.

9700986,comment,9698434,9698640,0,0,cheddar,,,"I&#x27;m biased in that I had the honor of writing the first line of code of Druid, but from looking at what I could find on Pinot it looks like architecture-wise, we share a lot of similarities.  At a minimum, the thought behind how to scale and how to ingest data appears to be the exact same.  Druid clusters are presently ingesting tens of billions of events per day (with a 50b number from Metamarkets in the venturebeat article) and housing trillions of rows.  From a high level architecture, I don&#x27;t see a reason Pinot couldn&#x27;t as well (when they are the same, it&#x27;s kinda hard to say that one can&#x27;t handle what the other can ;)).<p>On the query API-side, it appears like Pinot exposes &quot;PQL&quot; which is a SQL-like query language.  In Druid, for better or worse, we use JSON-based HTTP calls.  Once you are using a client for querying in a programmatic manner, the difference doesn&#x27;t really matter, but it is true that something like PQL makes it simpler for humans to write their own queries.<p>For management of distributed state, it looks like Pinot depends on Apache Helix, which is an interesting framework.  This was the first time I had heard about it and, I really would&#x27;ve liked to have something like that to build on when we started Druid.  We instead had to implement it all ourselves.  Helix sounds like it provides all the hooks to enable the various levels of integration that we have needs for in Druid, so I can only imagine that there is little difference in capability there.  My biggest fear is that the majority of operational issues that we run into with Druid is around zookeeper integration, losing an entire ZK cluster is painful (and does happen) and from my read of the Helix docs, that would likely cause a loss of all shards of data as well (it looks like they are persistent znodes?).<p>In terms of storage format, Druid enforces bitmap indexing and the Pinot docs appear to indicate that they have multiple types of indexes available, which is pretty cool.  It looks like Pinot doesn&#x27;t have a way to plug in user-defined column formats, though, so it would likely be require a bit of extra work to extend the system to be able to handle more complex types of aggregators like sketches.  And, really, enabling sketching extensions is one of the most important features of any &quot;scalable realtime processing&quot; tool, in my opinion.<p>On the ingestion side, it appears that Pinot reads data from kafka in real-time and then restating from batch, which is the model we&#x27;ve employed in Druid for the last 4 years, so we know it works.  I&#x27;d love to know how Pinot guarantees high availability and replication of the real-time stream, there are many ways of doing that (over the years, we&#x27;ve implemented 3 different ways in Druid and are still not particularly happy with any of them).<p>Anyway, I still haven&#x27;t had a chance to play with Pinot, so this could be completely off-base, but those are my initial reactions.",1434042929

Large development organizations, ala Google, Amazon, etc. are utterly unlike anything on &quot;the outside&quot;.  This happens slowly over time and is a combination of many factors: centralization of infrastructure, sheer scale (the developer tools teams in many of these shops are often bigger than <i>many other entire software companies</i>), the ability to make cross-cutting decisions for the organization in ways that aren&#x27;t appropriate for a decentralied external community, etc.<p>Given all that, I give huge props to the Go team for this kind of self-restraint.  It&#x27;s an enourmously painful decision for the community, but absolutely the right one <i>if you aren&#x27;t actually feeling the pain</i>.

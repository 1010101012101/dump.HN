3604520,comment,3603892,3603892,1,0,dlikhten,,,"I must disagree with everyone. MS's downfall was not the Wizard of OZ style problem. The problem is investments. You see any good investor will tell you the same thing: DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO. Sure if I invested into google day 1, I'd be rich. If I bought Apple stock when it was $80 a pop, I'd be rich. Etc. HOWEVER knowing that a-priori is impossible, so you diversify.<p>If you think Microsoft, what do you think?<p>> Microsoft Windows<p>> Microsoft Office<p>> Internet Explorer<p>> .Net<p>Let's tackle them:<p>Internet Explorer -- Use windows. It only works on windows. If you leave windows your browser is no longer available. Originally intended to make even the web work on windows only. Basically Macs were crippled to all hell. Counters -> Firefox, Safari, Chrome are all cross platform, most people who use that suffer nothing switching.<p>.Net -- Its Objective-C for windows. There are more uses for it, yes, like writing servers as an alternative to java, except they work on windows. End of the day it serves the same purpose.<p>Windows -- The flagship product. This is what MS wants you to use, and on your server, because this makes MS money. The problem is that MS makes zero dollars from a computer that can run Windows. It makes money on windows. Piracy is a real problem. If I was to install a pirated windows on a computer, MS is quite furious for good reasons. Compare that to Apple who will give you a copy of OSX if you ask them really nicely, and does NOTHING to prevent piracy. The only thing they care is that it runs on Apple hardware. More later.<p>Office -- The other flagship product. They convince businesses that sharing information is only possible with this. Period. As Google Docs, LibreOffice, Confluence, Basecamp, etc start to become more and more popular, the office stronghold is being chipped away brick by brick, and MS can't lay bricks fast enough to counter.<p>Let's compare that to Apple's model:<p>iTunes -- Initially shipped with DRM to prevent using anything other than iPods to play music. By the time they removed DRM it didn't matter, iPods were here to stay.<p>App Store -- You can only run the apps on iPhone/iPod/iPad/OSX<p>OSX -- If it's pirated, who cares, it only runs on Apple hardware.<p>Garage Band -- Eh, its cheap. Whatever, use it if you like. Its OSX only so we'll give it practically for free.<p>Safari -- Runs on windows and mac. They don't care about linux. Just to get people used to the ""mac way""",1329505079

I recall a series that ABC news did on unemployment and they profiled a gal who, in their story, seemed like a sad case of working hard and not getting anywhere. Unfortunately for them there was enough PII in the story that one could do a bit of Googling and figure out who this person was, only to find they were a convicted felon (drug possesion with intent to sell), in and out of rehab, and recently 'laid off' when their Nova job term timed out and the employer elected not to hire full time. That is also a sad story but it would not have 'worked' for what the news producer was going for 'Regular folks, working hard, and unable to find work.'<p>I agree its quite different to omit facts to make your story more credible, buts another form of this 'info-veganism' which. Generally I've been happy with the Economist (they seem less tempted by this sort of thing than others) and it suggests that there is once again an opportunity to create a news organization. (If you are old enough to remember, Fox News was created on the back of the first Iraq War with the tagline 'we report, you decide' trying to take the editorial spin out of reporting which was so evident in CNN's coverage, of course once it was a going concern that changed.)

You can't, for example, deploy the app to a static CDN, or serve templates from a CDN. Templates can't be cached on the client, so you've developed what is essentially an elaborate partials caching infrastructure that is likely very brittle and must be watched over closely to maintain speed benefits (keeping all those things in mind when content changes -- what to throw out and what to keep, etc).<p>Also, by delivering HTML you're limiting your presentation to browser-only devices, at least with this app. I know basecamp has a JSON API, and at that point, why didn't you just do a traditional client side app I wonder? I think the answer rests in the fact that you preferred the ""niceness"" of server side development, which is arguably more mature than client side at the present time. If that's the only benefit, in a few years, do you think that advantage will hold true?",1329504772
3604493,comment,3602407,3602407,4,0,iamgilesbowkett,,,"This is a very rewarding thing to do. I recommend it to everyone. You don't necessarily even need to use AI.<p>I filter HN with <a href=""http://hacker-newspaper.gilesb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacker-newspaper.gilesb.com/</a>, which pulls RSS, filters it, and reformats it on an hourly cron job. I mainly did it for the typography -- I disagree with just about every visual design decision on Hacker News -- but added very primitive filtering after the fact. I throw out any story from TechCrunch, Zed Shaw, Steve Yegge, and Jeff Atwood, because I just got tired of them, and any story with ""YC"" in it, too, because I got tired of seeing job ads for Y Combinator startups. (In fact it was the job ad for a Curebits marketing manager right after their scandal that did it.)<p>When Apple launched the iPad, I went in and added a simple regex to filter out any story about it. Hacker News is a great source for skimming but occasionally gets fixated on topics. I get like a hundred uniques a day so it's not exactly a huge hit, but I've thought about making a commercial version with customization. It got featured on Mashable and somebody created an iPad app which looked very, VERY similar, which I'm going to take as validating my design. But whether or not I ever startupify it, anyone who wants a customized version can just fork the project, deploy their own version in like ten or twenty minutes, and tweak regexes to their heart's content. It's on GitHub (<a href=""https://github.com/gilesbowkett/hacker_newspaper"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gilesbowkett/hacker_newspaper</a>) and only requires the most basic proficiency with cron, ruby, and python.<p>I also want to add comment-scanning. Right now I don't use comment links at all. The code extracts them but then simply throws them away. I don't want to add comment links back in unless I can also set it up to alert me if the comments thread contains comments from raganwald, patio11, jashkenas, amyhoy, etc -- basically automated comment elitism. I'm not trying to be a dick with that, I'm just a busy dude.<p>Anyway, when I set out to do this, I planned on doing a bunch of Bayesian whatnot, but I found that I got most of the way there just tweaking regexes occasionally. Likewise there's a lot of rough edges I could clean up, e.g., text encoding is a bit of a mess, and summarization in the style of <a href=""http://tldr.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tldr.it/</a> would make it way more useful.<p>But I recommend it because making deliberate decisions about what info you want to get from HN makes it a lot less like watching TV and a lot more like doing actual research into topics which interest you.

We crank out functionality faster when it can be done server-side because the development experience is better and because Ruby still beats even CoffeeScript (although not as thoroughly as it used to beat vanilla JavaScript) for productivity.<p>I find the complexity needed in having MVCs on both client and server side to be the main problem. Especially since much of what applications like Basecamp are not all that heavy on the UI-interaction. A few bits are, like a calendar, so we use it there.<p>But obviously you can make it work either way. Just like Facebook manages to make PHP work. And some crazy kids still use Java. You should pick a development environment and style that fits your brain and your sensibilities. If you think client-side development is lovely, then by all means, go to town.

If they're reproduceable for me in my browser, they're easy to fix.<p>Now, extjs is a DSL, it's closer to flex development than to traditional web development. It has a learning curve with a pay-off at the end, and the pay-off is easier ui development. If you're building ui the traditional way, but client-side, ymmv. Still, anything to do with rendering glitches is something you'll have to debug by eyeballing it, regardless of where you render your ui. There's no way of automatically logging misplaced floats.<p>P.S. There's also less to monitor. Typically you'll monitor for performance and security.

Its like the difference between Apartment Brokers vs Real Estate Brokers: The Apartment Brokers are jokers, because they need to deal with 1000's of people to make the 30-40 fees a year that make up a decent living.  A Real Estate Broker can do a tenth of the deals and make twice as much.  The quality of service is a lot higher.<p>Likewise, in high paying industry with top tier compensation the recruiters are much higher quality.  I only need to make 5 placements a year to make six-figures, where as the jokers at Selby Jennings or those other massive paper houses need to make 15-20 placements to even get close to that.<p>I can afford to treat candidates with respect, protect their information, and tailor their search.

I agree, and I understand why they wouldn't. My point is that they lost a recurring customer by not creating it. Think of it similar to the police response to a bank robbery. I can guarantee that the cost of the response is several orders of magnitude greater than amount even in the bank, let alone what the thieves are actually able to steal. That is because they are not reacting to the cost of the money being stolen, but to the long term costs of making it seem like anyone can rob a bank. If Microsoft made an App for EVERY platform, regardless of cost, it would be hard for anyone to even penetrate into the marketplace, therefore ensuring longer term success.<p>Secondly, Microsoft loses over 2B a year with Bing. They are a huge company with very deep pockets, and I highly doubt hiring a few dozen swissarmy programmers would make much of a dent comparatively.

It trivializes, causes technical debt, and lets you evolve your software into a corner so you don't want to work on it anymore.<p>Second, Shut up. And learn the business.  It's been making money with out me.  I'm here to help the business either make more money with the same or less effort, or save it money.  That's the only value I provide.  Don't let my interpretations and trivialization ruin what competitive advantage they have in their processes now, no matter how archaic or manual it might be.  If they have no process or system in place, get that created first and let the software reflect it.  DO NOT BUILD SOFTWARE FOR SOMETHING THAT DOESNT HAVE A REASONABLY WORKING MANUAL PROCESS.  Read The Toyota Way to know why.<p>Third, let everyone know the ultimate goal is to help everyone get more done without less effort.  Overcoming empire builders, insecurity and politics is as real of a requirement to overcome as anything, be it a small or large project.<p>To get there, we have the dreaded requirements doc.<p>For me requirement docs come in two forms.  When know know how to solve a problem, or when we don't.  How those are written are quite different.<p>Writing a document for unknown requirements is most often best approached with an agile feedback-loop process.  Documenting the benefits of this is critical so everyone knows why we're ""trying"" instead of ""just building it"".  Miss this, and the software project is one of the failed 70%.<p>Writing a document for known requirements (and how to get there) is quite a bit different.  Since we're doing what we know how to do, in situation largely familar to us, getting very clear language and agreement on the following is absolutely critical:<p>- What needs to be done (functional design),<p>- How it needs to be done (technical design / blueprint),<p>- Who needs to be doing what, when.<p>Either way, starting a requirements without a clear explanation of the problem, nor a clear description of the goal of what the experience should be, adds tremendous variables and unknowns, without good reason.",1329501842

Technology has its fashion moments and this is one of them. When you elevate the OS to the level of 'brand' you enter into a world where fashion as well as features dictate acceptance. So in that world, they need to have a fashion statement as well as a technology statement.<p>That being said, its also easy to get stuck in a rut and have that kill your project. Microsoft has perhaps more scars than many in this area. If you recall they did a 'tablet' version of Windows long before iOS, but they failed to 're-imagine' and instead they tried to 'shoehorn' ideas which didn't make sense (we'll assume you have a high precision pointing device like a stylus or mouse) and so those preconceptions prevented them from seeing what needed to be done.<p>Mostly I think the messaging about the flag and what not is PR to try to tell people ""Hey, we're awake and we're trying to innovate, and we want to be better, and we're sorry for Vista."" If their stock price is any indication they are having some success there.",1329501772

7261330,comment,7253710,7258183,2,0,userbinator,,,"> All of this is really to make the programmers more efficient, because programmer time is expensive (and getting stuff out the door quicker is important), but the amount of lost time (and money) on the user&#x27;s end, waiting for these monstrosities of abstraction to compute something must far far exceed those costs.<p>I believe that the amount of time spent optimising software should be proportional to how long it will be used for, and how many users it has/will have. It makes little sense to spend an hour to take 10 minutes off the execution time of a quick-and-dirty script that will only be run once or twice. It makes a <i>lot</i> of sense to spend an hour, or even a day or week, to take 1 second off the execution time of software with hundreds of thousands or millions of users that constantly use it. At some point the overhead of optimisation is less than the time (or memory?) saved by everyone, so the &quot;programmer time is expensive&quot; line of thinking is really a form of selfishness; interesting that free/open-source software hasn&#x27;t evolved differently, since it operates under a different set of assumptions.",1392760652

Plus, the full commissions usually go to the best salesperson, or Cheerleader.  \nIt&#x27;s eight courses!  Two years for a broker--who most likely \ngot their brokers license with any four year college degree.\n(Yea--most of these guys partied through a bachler&#x27;s degree\nbefore this year and got their broker&#x27;s license.  They \nlobbied Gov. Moonbeam to make it harder for anyone else\nto do what they did--The Terminator saw right through the\nploy, and vetoed the bill--ironic?)\nSuccess is moving Realestate.  The average homeowner \nonly realizes they could have got more after they do\ntheir homework, but that never really happens--they go into\ndenial after the sale.  It&#x27;s done.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a industry that needs a fresh, iron clad \nApplication, but it has to be top notch.

We&#x27;ve had climate and audio controls since the 1950s. We&#x27;ve since added speakerphones and navigation, but the former only requires a couple of buttons, and the latter shouldn&#x27;t really require any adjustment while driving.<p>There&#x27;s also no shortage of space to put the controls.<p>My guess is that touch screens will start to dominate in cost-sensitive segments of the industry, while physical controls will migrate to luxury status in a few years.",1392760154
7261319,comment,7259239,7260067,2,0,jdietrich,,,">The nature of this (radio, etc) doesn&#x27;t really matter. There will be a receiver on the car that can and will be identified and removed by criminals, rendering the stated purpose moot. Of course removing the receiver will be made illegal, as if this will accomplish anything.<p>It has been effectively impossible to hotwire a new car for over a decade, because modern cars simply will not start without the say-so of the ECU, which is a highly secure black box. Stealing a modern car means stealing the keys, because highly sophisticated organised criminals have failed totally in developing practical attacks to circumvent immobilisers. Build the remote shutdown facility into the ECU and it will be essentially impossible to disable. Send the remote shutdown instruction over a suitably designed radio link and jamming becomes utterly impractical. I have very little doubt that the motor industry is capable of designing a very effective remote shutdown systems; Relatively crude aftermarket solutions are already being used very effectively by fleet operators.<p>There are perfectly legitimate civil liberties objections to such a scheme, but the usual hacker trope of &quot;technologies that I don&#x27;t like can always be circumvented&quot; is just plain wrong. Crime can be prevented or substantially curtailed through the effective use of technology, as we have seen in Europe with IMEI-based blocking of stolen mobile phones. Cash-in-transit robberies are now quite rare, due to design improvements in CiT boxes. Security technology isn&#x27;t perfect, but that doesn&#x27;t make it useless.",1392760063
7261318,comment,7261003,7261003,4,0,banachtarski,,,"The designer evidently hasn&#x27;t looked into any of the multitouch research. This interface would actually be far harder to use, learn, and get accustomed to than existing interfaces. It&#x27;s unintuitive. There&#x27;s no reason why 2 fingers should correspond to volume. With loose coupling like that, and no standards committee, hopping from one car to another will be extremely annoying.<p>Interfaces need to have strong couplings between action and zero overloading. Two finger ubiquitously means &quot;scroll now&quot; on trackpad. But even on an iphone, multitouch is seldom used for this reason. A trackpad has no images to display, so it is <i>forced</i> to overload gestures with multitouch. Phone don&#x27;t have this limitation, and thus, intelligently avoid the use of multitouch.<p>As another anecdote, mobile games that rely on multitouch tend to not do so well.",1392760053
7261317,comment,7259845,7259845,10,0,RogerL,,,"I would like to share how inhuman a lot of the interview processes are. Some examples:\n* recruiter says a startup is interested, introduces me to the HR person via email. I get a 2 sentence email from HR, telling me that I have to schedule a phone technical interview in the next day or two, they need to onboard FAST.<p>Okay, I don&#x27;t know what the job is, who the client is, and the last thing I want to do is be grilled over the phone. I&#x27;m certainly uninterested in your time crunch and am not going to rearrange my life to meet your schedule requirements (there were narrow stipulations on acceptable times).<p>* Talk with a company, and explain that I don&#x27;t do whiteboard interviewing. Oh, a session is no problem, but the interview has to be as much letting me interview and question you. &#x27;No problem, we just want to talk and see where you&#x27;ll fit in&#x27;.<p>Come the day, and I barely get a &#x27;hi&#x27;, just nonstop whiteboard coding in an intense environment. Took the whole day off for that time waste. Two of the sessions had me solve essentially the identical problem - I waste my day, they don&#x27;t take 5 minutes to plan out what I&#x27;ll be asked. Then they call me back, and tell me I have to come in for another series a day later, which was entirely unexpected, and not communicated to me prior to agreeing to interview. And if my requests for how the interview is conducted can&#x27;t be honored, fine, tell me, and either I&#x27;ll change my mind or decide not to waste a day taken from work. The cap to all of that was the &#x27;shoot the messenger&#x27; emails when I said I was not accepting due to how this all went down (and oh, I didn&#x27;t respond quickly enough to that email, meaning it took me a few hours, so more grief for that).<p>* Just general, insistent demands as if I have nothing to do but interview with your company. If you have your resume out there, all you do is field phone calls and emails. I&#x27;m not going to pursue anything without knowing quite a bit about the job because I don&#x27;t have to. There is always going to be better, low hanging fruit - cold emails with very accurate, detailed descriptions of a wickedly cool start up, recruiters that actually get to know your skill sets and desires, and so on.<p>* No exposure to what the work will be like. It&#x27;s so secret they can&#x27;t tell you, or there is a &#x27;variety of work&#x27;, or whatever. No work environment tour. No discussion of compensation, work hours, and so on until you&#x27;ve wasted a day or more in interviews.<p>* &#x27;Go and study this book for a month, and then apply&#x27;. Um, I&#x27;m 47 and have a very successful career of inventions and products. Surely you don&#x27;t have to quiz me on red-black tree implementation to access my abilities. If I need to know that, I&#x27;ll open the book and learn it.<p>It was, by and large, very unpleasant. Perhaps it is not the best proxy, but I go in assuming the interview process is the time you are trying to impress and woo me the most, and judge you on that.",1392760039

Nobody is running &quot;full-blown copies of Ubuntu&quot; under docker, because full-blown would imply &quot;with upstart&quot; and using your distributions&#x27; built-in /sbin/init is precluded by the fact that docker overrides it, and also that Upstart doesn&#x27;t work well in a container.<p>So people are running parts of Ubuntu without understanding that sometimes those parts had expectations of being child processes of upstart, and that upstart would always be running, when in docker-land that&#x27;s not a reasonable expectation (and OP addresses this by adding in a more reasonable init, which probably handles most of these concerns.)<p>I just built the baseimage-docker, trying to get into it with ssh now, I can&#x27;t imagine giving anyone a container and not letting them ssh into it, and I&#x27;ve added ssh to containers before in a way that I knew was non-supported or broken, so it&#x27;s good to have this example.

7261304,comment,7190167,7195182,1,0,srj,,,"I think that model oversimplifies it a bit, though for some implementations you&#x27;re correct.<p>Often however IRC servers are either a hub or leaf. A hub accepts no user traffic directly and its IP address does not need to be publicly known. That makes it difficult to split the network since only the leaf addresses are known to an attacker.<p>As for the leaf servers, you can prioritize traffic between the leaf and hub over the traffic between the leaf and its users. You can also have them travel over different peers (most of the servers in the network I have experience with are multi-homed). Usually DoS attacks then manifest themselves as a large number of users timing out from their leaf server. Many IRC clients will attempt to connect to other known leaf servers when they cannot reconnect to the one that dropped them, meaning they get back onto a healthy leaf.<p>An attacker would then need to be able to saturate all (or at least most) of the leaf servers to take down the network. In my experience IRC servers run on networks that far exceed IRC&#x27;s requirements and taking down all leafs at once would be a tall order for all but the largest botnets.<p>There have also been anycast IRC implementations which I don&#x27;t have experience with, but I imagine they would mitigate most simple DoS attacks.",1392759732

There are no cues to tell the user what two fingers vs. four fingers will do, or what the difference is between a close-fingered gesture and a wide gesture. At best, you&#x27;d have to standardize the meanings across all cars (something that rarely happens in autos, even today there&#x27;s no standard for where the wiper controls go, for instance), and even then, people would have to memorize those invisible gestures before they could use their car.<p>Secondly, accidental inputs would happen with some frequency. People have a wide range of hand sizes, motor control skills, even number of fingers. Suppose I&#x27;ve got two of my fingers in a cast? I can use an existing car&#x27;s dashboard just fine with that temporary impairment, but not this.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s addressing a problem that already has a solution—physical, dedicated input devices. Humans have spatial memory, we learn where things are, and learn to reach for them without looking or even thinking. Your muscle memory tells you how to reach the wiper stalk or the gear shift, which is why it&#x27;s sometimes disconcerting to get into a car with the gears on the steering column if you normally shift in the center console. We need in-car systems that let the physical feedback, affordances, and reliable location of buttons, knobs, and switches interact with display systems that are designed for the attention a driver requires.

This is crucial to know because the bar is hidden by default, yet it contains fundamental actions like deleting a message in Mail or navigating to a URL in Internet Explorer.<p>When using a mouse instead, you&#x27;re supposed to right-click to bring up the &quot;control bar&quot;. This is completely non-discoverable and also goes against every established UI convention: for the past 20+ years, the right button has been used for context menus, but suddenly in Metro it brings up a hidden application-global menu instead.<p>Windows 8.1 tried to fix this by adding a button in the corner that brings up the bar, so at least you can find it by clicking around. But that&#x27;s still not good enough. The bar makes sense on a tablet where screen real estate is limited and the swipe feels very natural, but on a desktop it&#x27;s just a bad toolbar implementation that adds extra mouse navigation to simple tasks because people never figure out the right-click shortcut.",1392759036

Only a few of them frequently, but definitely more than 8 in total.<p>One of the thoughts I had was that using a (say 90 degree?) twist motion along with a number of fingers could bring up sub-menus.  That way if you want to adjust other radio parameters like fade, balance, equalizer, etc you would put two fingers on (for volume) and twist.<p>Maybe you&#x27;d arrange the different controls in a loop so that every twist indexes to the next and there&#x27;s a ~10 second timeout before you head back to the default.

Or was Windows 8 an unnecessary slip-up on the road to the future?<p>What a load of trash. People need to stop judging Microsoft products in terms of unreleased products. I understand that the hackers et al. who use the power features in Windows are upset that MS changed the game on them, but putting Metro as the forefront of the UI was, as the article describes, a necessary step in getting users to actually use it.<p>Metro UI is quite good for browsing content and navigating to the things that you&#x27;re certain to want. It&#x27;s good looking and it works pretty well. Just because it&#x27;s your launch screen doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s supposed to be the only tool you ever need.

The applications you want can be at your fingertips, instead of in a button in the corner.

Then again, there&#x27;s not a great alternative.<p>Why offer the multiple bitrates on the HLS stream at all? You know what the client&#x27;s bandwidth is, why perform three separate live transcodes? Is this because you&#x27;re delivering the stream to an iOS app and Apple requires that? In Safari or a UIWebkitView based app you probably wouldn&#x27;t have to do that... Or is it to compensate for potential bandwidth fluctuations?<p>You mentioned the mpeg-ts segmenter in more recent versions of ffmpeg but also mentioned that it has unacceptably high latency. I have not found this to be the case so long as you set the segment times individually and force new keyframes at given times (-force_key_frames and -segment_times flags, otherwise the segmenter ignores your segment time option and just creates TS chunks at whatever frequency it wants to).<p>Pre-transcoding the first few seconds is a really great approach that I had never considered before.

The company had two sales guys as well, not sure of their compensation but they were making more than me...  We all quit within a period of two months due to A) the CEO flat out lying to a customer about the nature of the data they were being sold, in order to secure the sale - the customer later made threats to sue after their patience had been exhausted due to one founder trying for a month to gaslight their board about the technical nature of the data B) lies about the &quot;cash flow problem&quot; which I was told was preventing another person to be hired to help me (the founders were skimming profit before paying everyone, months late)  The CEO&#x27;s wife, who liked to play lawyer, then dragged out paying us for what they owed, trying to arbitrarily reinterpret the language of the contracts, claiming utter nonsense as logic and being over the top abusive in contract negotiations.  It was all too much for everyone.<p>Later I found out a $5 mil offer had been made to buy the company from a 3rd party - not much but enough to show the company was certainly going to be viable.  So it made perfect economic sense to these sociopaths to drive out everyone who might have some moral claim to profiting from the company&#x27;s success (i.e. promises were made early about &quot;equity&quot;).  The founders deemed I was completely unnecessary at this point due to having built something that could be maintained well enough by cheap labor from India and eLance - to heck with looking into the future and seeing how an experienced engineer might open up new markets, etc. This company lost every bit of technical knowledge they had when I left.<p>But that&#x27;s sociopaths for you and how business is done anymore.

Which is most definitively <i>not a problem</i>, because casual users won&#x27;t be coming into contact with that feature, anyway.

On territory this well-trodden, it should have required precisely zero lateral thinking for Microsoft to figure out how to respond to that focus group result.<p>Similarly, when Apple added a tablet-inspired application launcher to OS X, they figured out a great way to make it both easy-to-access and non-disruptive, without displacing any existing workflows.  The launcher&#x27;s there and works well for users who want it, and is effectively non-existent for users who don&#x27;t.<p>That anecdote from the article, if true, is yet another delightfully pithy illustration of Microsoft&#x27;s fundamental difficulty with UX:  They don&#x27;t grasp the difference between &quot;one size fits all&quot; and &quot;all fit one size&quot;.",1392758276

We learned after a couple of mishirings that the most difficult part of the job is being able to manage emotion and taking rejection. For example, as a rep it is completely normal to be rejected in some manner 50 times a day. So if you get discouraged or upset after your third rejection, it is unlikely that you would have the motivation or drive to make more calls and therefore, you&#x27;re likely not the right fit.

7261110,comment,7252500,7260801,2,0,welterde,,,"> Might the current IPv6 numbers just reflect that a lot of people aren&#x27;t peering or anything?<p>Peering doesn&#x27;t require you to announce more routes per se, although some networks do it for traffic engineering purposes. From an BGP [1] perspective there is not that much difference between peering and transit.<p>> I was under the impression that a lot of announcements were driven by the need for not relying on a single provider.<p>Multihoming is another issue. And you can explain the difference in the number of AS [2] as networks not having deployed IPv6 yet. But the number of announced routes per network will be lower for IPv6 than it is for IPv4 (which hasn&#x27;t even reached the worst case yet).<p>> For P2P apps, NAT doesn&#x27;t pose a whole lot more of a problem than a firewall with the same configuration. So you&#x27;d use UPnP or whatever protocol to get around it. At that point, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, does it? The app talks to local gateway and ask for the IP and port forwarding either way.<p>But that way you are still pushing more logic into the applications (namely that they have to implement UPnP). Which actually might end up requiring more code than your actual application (SAFT [3] for instance..). Now in the firewall you could just allow known-good inbound ports and be done with it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_%28Internet%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_%28Internet%2...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/saft/sendfile.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fex.rus.uni-stuttgart.de/saft/sendfile.html</a>",1392758060

Haskell has a lot of issues, but that&#x27;s really not one of them. You can write a Haskell program and be relatively confident that it&#x27;s going to work right in a way you simply won&#x27;t be with, eg, Java. And you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to wait until compiling. With ghc-mod and vim/emacs configured, you&#x27;ll be notified upon saving if you blew up something in the current file. You don&#x27;t need to run your code in a REPL to find out about it, although GHCi is pretty good. You spend a lot less time figuring out what goes wrong at runtime, although I&#x27;ll grand you that the tooling is poor enough that you have a bad time doing when it happens.<p>> I qualify this to rule out Python, which has weak typing<p>Excuse me? You rule out <i>Python</i> due to weak typing and mutability but disqualify Javascript due to its REPL? This must be sarcasm. I have no comment about Javascript&#x27;s REPL (which one? node&#x27;s?), but Python is most certainly not weakly typed, not in the way &quot;weak typing&quot; is commonly understood.

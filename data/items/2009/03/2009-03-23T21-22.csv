It's statistically impossible to climb tree shaped ladders, because they get exponentially smaller at the top, and there are too many levels.

It should be obvious to computer scientists, via pigeonhole arguments, why this isn't statistically feasible.<p>In any case, it's probably easier to find loopholes, like startups, or being an early arrival to an industry, or starting at a smaller company that inflates later, or tunneling your way between points in the corporate topology, by switching from one company to another, if you're ambitious.

One job might be more difficult to one person than another. I think programming is pretty easy, and construction work is a lot of effort - should I get paid less for programming than a construction worker?<p>So what SHOULD one's pay be based on? The value of their labor - the value their labor provides. This is very similar to how businesses work, which is why is it sound from a game theoretic sense. Businesses (typically) charge an amount that is based on what their product is worth. You buy the item because it provides more value than the cost of giving them that money. This way, both the business is incented to charge somewhere around that amount (because they get value from the sale) and the consumer gets value as well (cost - value to them).",1237842218

Baker realized there was more value to Zellers’ real estate than to the operation itself, since Walmart had soundly beaten the brand. An astute deal maker, Baker and his team reached out to Target to stoke the company’s interest.</i><p>And they&#x27;d planned for a fast entry into the Canadian retail market:<p><i>But the company had previously decided it wanted to grow as quickly as possible if it were to enter Canada, rather than pursue a slow, piecemeal expansion. The challenge was in acquiring enough real estate to make that possible. The Zellers sale provided just such an opportunity.</i><p>And all because they thought they really could do this:<p><i>But Steinhafel may have felt justified in making such a bold move. In the three years since he was appointed CEO, he’d boosted revenue 8.3%—not a huge number, but an impressive one, considering the U.S. was experiencing the worst recession since the Great Depression. Steinhafel had joined Target in 1979, and his entire professional career had been spent with the company. Target experienced steady growth during that time, and Steinhafel had simply become accustomed to succeeding. “The company had never really failed before,” says a former employee who worked in both the U.S. and Canada.

In <i>that</i> sense, both of them do have problems.<p>Circa 2000, Solaris, Linux, and some (all?) BSDs had M:N threading, and all of them threw it away because there are numerous performance artifacts caused by two schedulers (OS and the M:N) conflicting with each other. Mr. Cantrill was there when this all happened, and even wrote a paper on it: ftp://ftp.cs.brown.edu/pub/techreports/96/cs96-19.pdf<p>This doesn&#x27;t affect Erlang as much simply because Erlang is <i>really</i> slow. I think of it as a waterline -- the lower the overhead of the language, the more likely you will run into the serious problems that M:N typically inflicts. E.g. priority inversion, and long and unpredictable latencies when the OS swaps out a thread that M:N wanted running.<p>As for Haskell and STM, all I know on the topic is that some pretty damn smart engineers at IBM spent a good while trying to make STM work <i>well</i>, and gave up. See this ACM article: <a href=""https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1454466"" rel=""nofollow"">https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1454466</a>. Perhaps Haskell managed to pull it off through the language restrictions it allows, but I’d like to see some compelling articles on that by engineers who know a thing or two; just because a language has STM doesn’t mean it does it well.<p>Honestly, I think your comments about M:N and STM are more revealing of your ignorance rather that Cantrill&#x27;s.

It&#x27;s the plumbing that can really benefit from parallelism. This is true no matter whether you take the approach of giving your die space to the CPU or the GPU (and if I read your argument right, it&#x27;s that you prefer Apple&#x27;s approach of giving the die space to the GPU).<p>My point is that it&#x27;s not necessarily the case that you&#x27;re giving the most benefit to applications by doing that. GPU compute is hard to use—so hard that, to a first approximation, no consumer app anywhere uses it—and there are lots of computationally-intensive tasks that apps want to do that aren&#x27;t just displaying graphics. Take image decoding, for instance (very important on mobile for obvious reasons). You can run some parts of it on the GPU, but the gains, if any, are modest—and you can&#x27;t run the entropy decoder on the GPU no matter what. Yet image decoding parallelizes on multicore CPUs very well.<p>In fact, giving the die space to the GPU hits walls of its own. Most consumer apps have a hard time maxing out the GPU. Mobile GPUs have gotten so powerful that pushing textures around with trivial shaders, which is what typical &quot;flat design&quot; apps do, is utterly trivial and comes nowhere near to full GPU utilization. So the GPU sits there idle most of the time.<p>The bottom line, to me, is that parallelism&#x27;s just hard. It&#x27;s not clear that the recent trend of giving all die space to the GPU instead of using it for CPU cores is actually going to do anything to increase our apps&#x27; parallelism, except maybe for games. In fact, I worry it actually may end up having the reverse effect.",1453507742

The extended family is still poor, so I&#x27;m still exposed to how they think about money.  I think the mindsets can break down into three levels, but not cleanly.<p>Poor: You may have to make decisions about which bills to pay or which needs to meet, and being able to pay all your bills and eat is considered a moral virtue.  Money is naturally transient, because your obligations have similar weight to your income, and having excess money in your bank account is weird, unnatural to the point that your instinct is to spend it before it goes away.  If you use a budget, line-items are on the size of a grocery trip.  You&#x27;re more likely to budget small purchases than large purchases.  If you are trying to build savings, putting money into a savings account is another bill.<p>Middle class: Your bank account is the intermediary between your bills and income, with a mean and a natural trajectory. If your account&#x27;s trajectory is positive, your natural instinct is to spend it, either on better lifestyle or a large purchase, very occasionally savings. If you have a budget, components are like &quot;monthly food&quot; and you deal with going over-budget by cutting a few more corners next month. Savings are still another bill. Putting the right amount into your savings account to retire in 40 years is a moral obligation.<p>Capital class: Interest on your earnings is your primary source of income. Your rate of spending must be lower than the rate you earn interest; to do otherwise is dipping into capital, which is morally wrong. Any interest you don&#x27;t plan to spend is folded back into your capital, giving you a small, permanent raise.  I don&#x27;t understand this class too well because I&#x27;m still working on entering it.",1453507641

My suspicion is that portion of the blog post is a claim/hypothesis on the average persons within that economic segment (&#x27;poor people&#x27;) who start a startup.  Certainly that hypothesis could be wrong, and the post is meant to spark a conversation and describe the experiences of the author.<p>On another note, I suspect a portion of the motivation for the post was also in part sparked by the &quot;Privilege and Inequality in Silicon Valley&quot; in which does exist (see other folks comments); however, the post is more about the n of 1 experience, the challenges faced within building a startup, and the hypothesis that it may resonate with others facing that startup experience.  I think what you&#x27;re seeing in the comments is the resonating of the title in addition to the content of the piece. I personally believe these are two distinct issues: 1- building a successful startup coming from that background, 2- working in the SV/tech companies with ivy leaguers who tend to grow up in higher economic households / have experienced different lives therein making it harder to relate/fit in for those with diff backgrounds.  It&#x27;s certainly a deeper discussion. Wealthy people can have tremendous insecurities around sharing their wealthy therein can feel isolated.

If you just finished raising a seed or angel round, chances are you had less than 12 months of runway to begin with. Perhaps your personal savings was drying up or you were running out of friends and family resources that could help you run this out further. The sense of urgency and anxiety you felt while raising your seed round doesn&#x27;t go away simply because you were able to raise some money. If anything, it would increase. So the fact that someone had to specifically cover this in a blog post seems really counterintuitive to me.",1453507204

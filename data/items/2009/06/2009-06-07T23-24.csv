They mention mean IQ's without bothering with the bare minimum needed to make that information useful (standard deviation).  Even people in business math learn that mean without a SD is fairly worthless, but even more so when you're trying to <i>compare two means</i>.  I refuse to listen to people who refuse to meet the bare minimum requirements of proper scientific reasoning.<p>The reverse is easy to spot too, an honest analysis will simply show you the model they are using and explicitly state what assumptions are built into that particular model.  an honest debate can follow.",1244419194

People should of course be free to choose a lower risk pursuit, but the potential reward is also lower.<p>You're saying many entrepreneurs fail and that this sucks. But your post kind of assumes that <i>who</i> is an entrepreneur is predetermined. Instead, as I said, people should be free to choose the amount of risk they're willing to take, and yes, many of the people who choose to take big risks will fail. That's how it's supposed to work.<p>Also, obviously each person doesn't have to make this choice once for their entire life. They can fail and try something else.",1244419119

646559,comment,646453,646531,0,0,CyberFonic,,,"Agree with swombat's carefully worded response.  Would like to add a couple of points.<p>Entrepreneurs volunteer and are not forced to be ""pawns"".  They are the inventors.  People in general are content with the status quo, entrepreneurs on the hand are ""unreasonable"", they see better ways of doing things.  It is through this process of optimisation that society has progressed.<p>Trying anything new and/or different is inherently risky and thus there is the ever present chance of failure.  But failing to fail is worse, it means that you haven't tried hard enough.<p>Probably the most mistaken concept of entrepreneurship is that they do it for money.  That is what bankers and VC's do.  They don't have any vision of their own, instead they fund the visions of others.  Entrepreneurs do things to OPTIMISE, the money is merely the consequence of getting it right, in other words, people are prepared to pay money for the convenience, benefit, VALUE of the entrepreneurs' innovation.<p>Columbus wasn't told by his Queen to discover another route to India, he asked for money to embark on discovering a new route to India and failed ... he discovered a new land instead, created an avenue for trade. That is the typical failure of entrepreneurs, they dream big and fail by achieving something greater.<p>Anyone who sets out to be an entrepreneur solely to make money has failed before he has even started.",1244419061

646542,comment,646041,646469,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I think he's trying to say that postmodernism is a critical methodology, rather than a collection of assertions - much as science is a systematic way of developing knowledge, rather than just the sum of its various axioms.<p>ThomPete, you might find it instructive to consider that the major problem of postmodernism is its' adherents seeming inability to make simple declarative statements. Of course, simple declarative statements are often freighted with unspoken assumptions, and unpacking and analyzing these is a  postmodern exercise in itself, particularly that of Jacques Derrida and the deconstructionists.<p>But where many postmodernsists go wrong is in the attempt to make fully qualified and narrowly specified declarative statements, which end up being almost impossible to read. In their zeal to avoid implying anything or having their intentions misunderstood, postmodernists frequently alienate their audiences with discourse which resembles cultural autism. This creates the impression that post-modernists are actually in love with the comforting certainties of modernism, but have seen the negative results of too much certitude: they would still like to establish definitive truths, but have decided to do so very very carefully.<p>I am not against post modernism, which I believe has many interesting things to say and provides useful tools with which to understand the world and our place in it.

To every man but Taylor the target looks prohibitive. Still, they follow him. Fire stops them one hundred yards short of the château. The Germans are behind a hedgerow at mid-distance. Still feeling their way, Taylor's men flatten, open fire with rifles, and toss a few grenades, though the distance seems too great. By sheer chance, one grenade glances off the helmet of a German squatting in a foxhole. He jumps up, shouting: ""Kamerad! Kamerad!"" Thereupon twenty-four of the enemy walk from behind the hedgerow with their hands in the air. Taylor pares off one of his riflemen to march the prisoners back to the beach. The brief fight costs him three wounded. Within the château, he takes two more prisoners, a German doctor and his first-aid man. Taylor puts them on a ""kind of a parole,"" leaving his three wounded in their keeping while moving his platoon to the first crossroads beyond the château.</blockquote><p>The chateau looked untakeable, and perhaps it was.

That's one of the main reasons a free market is a productive way to allocate resources - it places high rewards on things of high value, and allows anyone to compete, so that more people will provide these high-value things, thus driving their price back down. In that way, your suggestion is true.<p>However, there are three implicit assumptions in your thesis that are very, very shaky.<p>The first and least harmful is the idea that ""being a pawn"" is somehow implicitly bad. You haven't established that at all. There is no absolute ""bad"", so you must be implying that it is worse than something else. I'd be curious as to what that thing is, in your mind. Perhaps, if you dig, you might find that actually, being an entrepreneur (pawn or not) is quite a good deal, better than most others.<p>The second false premise is that there is some kind of specific group of people who are deciding this, manipulating this system for their benefit. There is no such group. Or rather, there is - this group is all of us. We all benefit from a system which encourages innovation and competition and rewards it. There is no conspiracy to exploit entrepreneurs by somehow making them compete against all odds. Nobody sat down and thought ""I wonder if I can get all these useful idiots to start lots of innovative businesses so that... what?""<p>The third misconception is the idea that entrepreneurs are somehow being manipulated by this system beyond their understanding. If anything, I'd say it's the opposite. Entrepreneurs set out to shape the system around them to provide them with rewards.<p>The fact that some types of businesses have high failure rates (I still don't really believe those 95% business failure rates... I strongly suspect very shoddy statistics that have a very poor definition of ""success"") doesn't mean that somehow most entrepreneurs are being suckered into starting business.<p>I think you need to rethink this idea from the ground up, carefully examining your assumptions as you go along, and maybe talking to some entrepreneurs too.

Most of my own thesis comes from reading Eisenstein's ""Ascent of Humanity"", though I've put a little of my spin on it.<p>The basis of civilization - the good and the bad - comes down to our concepts of money and property. I'm only going to speak of the bad here.<p>Money earns interest, hence if you have it you are compelled to hold on to it; as well, because it compounds, a quick cash grab may theoretically exceed the return of any sustainable venture.<p>Property, on the other hand, makes us seek to control our world so that others can't. It started with land, but it's spread to just about everything, including abstract concepts.<p>Most competitive forces can be attributed to this volatile combination.<p>But the entrepreneur's motives may differ from competition; instead of grabbing money and holding on to it, or taking other people's land, resourcefulness and efficiency is another goal, and it is usually the one that produces the most successful businesses.<p>What civilization has done is to use money and property as proxies for efficiency, which for the entrepreneur encourages all negative externalities, and for society as a whole causes a lot of deep rifts and strife.<p>But I think that, ultimately, technology - by increasingly giving power to all individuals - is going to make the money and property concepts irrelevant.

Initiatives are not responsible for a significant fraction of that increase (and most of them are self-funding).<p>Note that the amount of the increase since 2005 is roughly equal to the deficit, so cutting back to then would balance the budget.<p>I'd argue that none of the new programs and increases since 2005 have been a significant benefit.

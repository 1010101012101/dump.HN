I just meant to point out that you can use ""next version"" to anecdotally refer to a shift in trend, which was how it was used in this case.<p>2) That which the bigger companies are pushing, which ultimately relates to a not insubstantial section of the web to follow suit.<p>3) You're absolutely right that microformats haven't been marketed yet. If it's news to you, have an exploration around the microformats wiki. You'd be surprised who's doing what.<p>If you're interested in some examples of the companies I mentioned:<p>- Yahoo uses hCalendar, hCard, hReview on almost all business listings, search results, events, and reviews.<p>- Flickr supports XFN and hCard on all profile pages, and use geo on their photos with geo tagged photos.<p>- Google use microformats to enhance their search results. I believe that XFN in particular plays a part in determining link relevance and they certainly use rel-nofollow. Across various Google products you will find hCards, XFN, rel-license and so on.<p>- Apple's .Mac webmail supports hCard.<p>- Microsoft are supposedly doing some big things with IE8 and microformats. They already use hCalendar in their WindowsLiveWriter.<p>- Technorati started a lot of the microformats. Basically no part of their site isn't covered with examples of them. They have a variety of services that you can use to do clever things with the microformats you use (such as their hCard to vCard converter - add a link to your page which when clicked parses the hCard and turns it into a vCard for easy addition to your address book).<p>Aside from these, you can add Twitter, Digg, Dreamweaver, Drupal, Facebook, Last.fm, Moveable Type, Pownce and Wordpress to the list of microformat users.",1209005467

172134,comment,171818,171818,0,0,jlujan,,,"The reason is that microformats are a perversion of CSS/HTML. CSS is not markup; it is to define visual style. I think it rather humorous that web ""developers"" rejoiced at the leaps and bounds HTML made when it went from HTML 4.01 to XHTML 1.0. One of the reasons is that browsers made up what ever HTML tags they saw fit. XHTML provided a way to define a standard set of tags and attributes and give application developers the means to extend them without breaking other peoples code. This includes semantic descriptions.<p>Most of the arguments for using microformats are forgetting that many smart people have already, more or less, solved the content description issue. Thats what the X in XHTML is. By specifying that XHTML is valid XML, you can abide by all the rules for XML... mainly the extensible portion. You can add custom attributes to any tag you feel. There are DTDs, XSD, RelaxNG, Schemetron, etc; DTDs and XSD seem to have won the battle over document definitions. The only arguments against custom XHTML attributes are becoming more and more irrelevant. Arguments based on browser support for custom XSD or DTD documents are already irrelevant because most browsers have, or will, add support for them as a requirement to support novel things like XSLT. Arguments that DTDs and Schemas are two difficult are not really arguments. They are difficult for a reason, semantic definition is difficult. Many of the problems with microformats, i.e. namespace collisions, have been ""solved"" in the various XML standards. There are already many, many tools for parsing and using XML including namespaces, XIncludes, XSD, DTD, XSLT, etc... However, the tools to make microformats actually usable and useful, do not exist. Other arguments about custom attributes not being XHTML Strict valid are also irrelevant. Adding custom attributes by definition shouldn't be strict valid. Strict validity is checked against the xhtml1-strict.dtd DTD. Not being XHTML strict valid isn't a bad thing as long as the document is still valid XML and a schema/DTD document exists to prove it. This is, in my opinion, a major flaw in microformats. There is no source of validity. Anyone can use any thing for microformat descriptions. There is no perception of validity what so ever.<p>Most of the arguments for microformats, especially coming from the community tend towards ignorance of details. When you don't fully understand the details of the XML roots of XHTML, you tend to try and hack it or reinvent the wheel. Really diving into XML technology beyond XHTML sheds insight and vision on where the XML trend is moving, why, and where XHTML can follow along.<p>The only questionably valid arguments are for the current landscape not fully supporting XHTML+XML. However, as I have stated, that is quickly becoming a non-issue. You can also argue that XML wasn't meant to be the solution to the semantic web... but I ask, why isn't it? Tell me why a language designed to mark-up any data cannot describe the semantics of that data?",1209004264

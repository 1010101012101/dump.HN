Just the app - no strings, no nasty jump back to being an employee, etc. It was for half a million dollars.<p>This gave us a lot to think about. Half a million wasn't enough. Was a million? Two?<p>And the conclusion we came to was: no. Not worth it. A good little SaaS like ours is a kind of a sinecure. We don't have to work much on Freckle at all and it keeps chugging along earning more and more every month. (And the more we work on it, the faster it grows. It's a choice we can make on a month by month basis.)<p>It would be damn foolish to sell it.<p>It was fun to think about. What would we do with a million dollars?

3323693,comment,3323518,3323518,4,0,tikhonj,,,"The definition of multimethods presented here sounds suspiciously like ad-hoc polymorphism (or just overloading functions). It seems like the real difficulty is not in the concept but in the fact that I've now seen under three different names: multiple-dispatch, ad-hoc polymorphism and overloading. All but the last name <i>seem</i> complex; since I initially encountered the concept in Java as overloading, I never thought much about it.<p>Polymorphism based on types like this is something that statically typed languages are naturally good at. Looking at his example code, the trick to having this sort of code in dynamically typed Python is to introduce type annotations via decorators. You're doing the work of static typing for a fraction of the benefits.<p>Additionally, a statically typed language can take this concept even further. Haskell, for example, supports polymorphic functions like this very well using type classes. It even allows functions polymorphic on their <i>return</i> types--you can have a function `read` which takes a String and returns whatever. This means you can actually even have polymorphic <i>constants</i>--maxBound, for example, is the maximum value of whatever numerical representation it happens to be.<p>Overall, I think features like this make more sense in a statically typed language. They fit in--you're already specifying types everywhere--and can do more. However, it is interesting to see how you could accomplish something like this in a dynamically typed language.",1323265600

What do we REALLY have to sell?"" So many assume that they will get bought because ""they have a great product"" or ""they are the best"" or ""they have traction,"" but honestly, that's not even why most bigco's acquire startups. As you pointed out.[1]<p>This is not a disease of startups alone, of course. Most employees never sit down and ask themselves how & where <i>they</i> create value for their employer, much less how much, and whether they're then earning too little or too much. They just stab around in the dark for a number they think they deserve.<p>But when an employee gets the value equation wrong, worst case scenario is he/she loses a job. A whole company, product, ecosystem doesn't go down the tubes.<p>(Sidebar: It really warms my little bootstrapping heart to see this becoming a serious discussion topic lately!)<p>[1]  There are other factors I'd add -- sometimes, it seems like a bigco buys a startup because they have too much M&A budget and simply want to fill a slot, check a genre off their list.

3323643,comment,3322898,3322898,9,0,dmbaggett,,,"Key line from the article: ""Python 3 [...] changed just too much that it broke all our code and not nearly enough that it would warrant upgrading immediately.""<p>To my thinking, Python, Ruby, and Perl make people productive primarily because of the availability of tons of high-quality packages that ""just work"". The Python Package Index (<a href=""http://pypi.python.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypi.python.org</a>) lists <i>18 thousand</i> packages now. Many are very high quality and require essentially no ""impedance matching"" to use with Python 2.7 except ""import package"". If there's a genuine issue with a package, you can usually use a several-line monkey-patch and leave the package source completely untouched. Beauty.<p>Put simply: there's no way for a language design to make writing code easier than not writing code. IMO, this is why, despite the warts, these languages are winning. JavaScript doesn't have a standardized module/import system, so its packages are fragmented across a dozen frameworks. But this may change if the world settles on ""one framework to rule them all"" (or maybe two: jQuery for UI and node.js server side).<p>But Python 3 breaks many of the available Python 2.X packages, and in exchange for improvements that in most cases seem more like tweaks than major design fixes. Things that should be fixed in both branches (e.g., OpenSSL cert validation support) are now relegated to ad hoc patches to Python 2.X, because all the development effort is going into the 3.X series now.<p>Finally, the biggest improvement to Python IMO hasn't come from the core team at all: it's the absolutely brilliant work being done by the PyPy team. I would love to see ""Python 4"" merge some of the ideas from the 3.X branch in a fully compatible way with Python 2, and move the standard implementation to PyPY. Among many other benefits, this would allow the Python community to start seriously exploring adding static type-checking facilities to the language, which would make it far more suitable for larger projects. (I'm not saying make Python into Java, but it would be nice to be able to declare types as one can in modern Lisp implementations, and have the compiler both check correctness and optimize using such hints.)",1323264801

3323635,story,,,2,1,abhijitdhakne,"How fucked up are the US cellphone carriers?",,"A whole lot. That is the answer to that question. I can't believe what Verizon just did today. They just decided to fucking rip off customers by providing crap on a Google developer device with Nexus branding. To top it, the feature that Google is trying to push with their Offers/Wallet would not be included in the device. It is disappointing to see Google complying with that demand. Also the device being exclusive to Verizon in US, makes it impossible for anyone to get the phone in any other networks. (You can get the GSM device unlocked from expansys.com and I am going to do just that)<p>Smart phones are like Razor blades or drugs. You buy a razor which is cheap, but the blades are the one that makes the company profitable. With iPhone and other smart phones, what the carriers have done is put every single customer on drugs and sucking them every month with the data bill with a 2 year commitment. It's also classic to see that the initial wave of smartphone data plan were unlimited, similar to someone who is offered the drugs on cheap and unlimited in the beginning. Once you hooked on, it's where they catch you with crazy data cap restrictions. 
With US being one of the most expensive mobile network, where an average person pays roughly 4% of their average income on a cellphone bill ($26,364 is the average median income as of OCT 2011). That is pretty high. I can't believe, even after paying $299 for a premium handset and another 70-100$/month for the next 2 years, I can't get a phone with the features that comes pre-installed in it? How fucked up is the system where there are essentially 2 big carriers screwing up the customers?<p>There is one carrier, who wants to sell itself so badly, that they can do everything in it's power to be bought by another carrier
Then there is another carrier who is really trying to stay afloat and made it pretty clear, that if the other small network is sold to a big network, they could be folded too. They are positioning themselves to increase their value if they do decide to fold. 
Then there are the two other giants - who are really there just to screw the customers. At least one network provides a better and reliable network and have taken a big lead when it comes to LTE. The 3G sucks for that carrier. Even with LTE which are on same frequency band of 700 MHZ for both the networks has ensured that their customers swap their phones with each other networks! Isn't that screwing customers? The SMS charges are a whole separate debate on any networks.<p>It's so ironic, that today there was a survey done which listed Verizon with the best service provided for mobile networks. That might be true, but isn't everything screwed up when it really comes down to customers getting what they really want when they buy that phone/plan?",1323264560

Dismissiveness is not really a unique sentiment here; I see a lot of posts along the lines of ""well yes he's complaining but it's a break with the past and its for the better, it's just a matter of time, and it will all work out in the end, yada yada""..<p>My point is that for this to actually be true (as opposed to just being wishful thinking, which there's a lot of right now), people are going to have to not only port their libraries but they will also need to maintain the resulting code.  If the library is at all popular already, the resulting code will, for some open-ended period of time (perhaps ""forever"") need to work on both Python 2 and Python 3.  And right now, though producing <i>a</i> port isn't monstrously hard, maintaining the resulting code across the 2/3 straddle is just no fun.  The code looks bad, it's harder to read, it's harder to maintain, it's just less fun overall.  Basically, maintaining a Python 3 port just takes some of the fun and aesthetic out of maintaining an open source library.  It's an imposition to those folks who want their code to be popular, forward-compatible, and beautiful due to the need to straddle.<p>IMO, I'm not sure that a Python 2.8 helps much here, but a more backwards compatible Python 3.3 would.  For example: match py3 bytes behavior with py2 string behavior, add u'' literals back in, maybe readd iteritems/iterkeys/itervalues on dict as aliases so we can use a common API for dicts, add the print keyword back in maybe, and other minor things that are really easy to do and don't have much defensibility other than ""it's cleaner to not have to have bw compat here"".",1323263495

One then could provide specific implementations for the functions with the largest memory/time overhead.<p>The end result _could_ be that one can write, say, a grep that can work with EBCDIC, UTF8 or ISO8859-1, without ever converting strings internally. For systems working with lots of text, that could decrease memory usage significantly.<p>Among the disadvantages of such an approach are:<p>- supporting multiple encodings efficiently will take significant time that, perhaps, is better spent elsewhere.<p>- the risk of obscure bugs increases ('string concatenation does not quite work if string a is EBCDIC, and string b is ISO8859-7, and a ends with rare character #x; somehow, the first character of b looses its diacritics in the result')<p>- a program/library that has that support will be larger. If a program works with multiple encodings internally, its working set will be larger.<p>- depending on the environment, the work (CPU time and/or programmer time) needed to call the 'correct for the character encoding' variant of a function can be too large (in particular, for functions that take multiple strings, it may be hard to choose the 'best' encoding to work with; if one takes function chains into account, the problem gets harder)<p>- it would not make text handling any easier, as programmers would, forever, have to keep specifying the encodings for the texts they read from, and write to, files and the network.<p>[That last one probably is not that significant, as I doubt we will get at the ideal world where all text is Unicode soon (and even there, one still has to choose between UTF8 and UTF16, at the least)]<p>I am not aware of any system that has attempted to take this approach, but would like to be educated on them.",1323263058

I consider myself as a fixer and builder but often wonder if this nature of mine has gotten me more trouble than otherwise.<p>To fix or build something for someone is so rewarding that you sometimes forget to do your own mundane but important stuff. Soon things accumulate and you deeply regret having been tinkering at things that doesn't really ""matter"".<p>But one way of looking at this is that atleast some of those people never forget me and are often happy to help me back in ways I could have never anticipated. Sometimes while helping others, I get to learn something really cool which becomes a bigger reward in itself.<p>After reading this, I feel that perhaps we are, after all social beings, probably instinctively acting this way. It gives true happiness to oneself and others. Perhaps that's what matters in the long run.",1360065437

I hope some of you may like my little app. To prevent too much ranting here are some quick answers to possible questions:<p>Q: The Hacker News website provides much more functionality than your app.<p>A: That's right. The app isn't made to replace the Hacker News website. It's made for frequent readers like me who want a quick and friendly-on-the-eye way to access the stories.<p>Q: I want your app but I don't want to pay for it.<p>A: No problem, Hacky is open source! Just get a copy of the source on GitHub and build it on your machine.<p>Q: Why are you then charging money for it in the first place?<p>A: Personally I like getting my apps via Mac App Store. It means easy updating and restoring. Unfortunately providing an app in the MAS isn't free for the developer as he has to purchase a Developer Certificate from Apple.

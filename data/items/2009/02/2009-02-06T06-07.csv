469481,comment,469149,469458,0,0,com,,,"Oh, at a technical level (ie. a corporate IT department as you mentioned) this is fairly true.<p>But what unalone was saying, it's not about the under-the-hood technical stuff in marketing, it's about a consistent story. If you can't join the dots with the user experience (and don't get me started about Powerpoint, Visio, Word and Excel in their 2008 iterations, with inconsistent look+feel, different behaviours, ribbon/menu inconsistencies) it's hard to sell this story.<p>Customer loyalty is a similar story - tactility, gorgeousness, smooth transitions from product to product (in an experiential sense, not how well COM+ interaction works) all trump weird unresponsiveness, beige-boxyness and uncomfortable mental transitions.<p>And perhaps this is one of the key issues for Microsoft - they're a technical organisation that has grown too big for obsessive and fanatical and consistent design to be implemented. MS Marketing must weep, unless they are too close to the issue too.",1233903450

No last-mile ISP has 'extorted' websites with threats of degraded access.<p>So there's no urgent need for legislators and regulators to start dictating how service is delivered, as if there will never be competition. If they want to help, they should adopt policies that spur new entrants, not tie the hands of current providers.",1233902955

However, if I can only get access through one or two providers, then those providers have an incentive to extort money out of websites by threatening to degrade access to their sites.<p>I think the real fix to the net neutrality problem is to open up local access so that the phone/cable company only provides the wire, and an unlimited number of ISPs compete to provide the net access. The phone/cable company probably shouldn't be allowed to provide the internet access, since they will inevitably abuse their monopoly (and necessary monopolies should be kept as limited as possible).",1233900884

And yet, when you raise prices on normal goods, the quantity demanded falls; if you force companies to pay employees more, they will hire less. If the data say otherwise, the data are either wrong or too noisy to be trustworthy. (Unfortunately, their paper wasn't merely an academic curiosity---it gave Bill Clinton and Congress political cover to raise the minimum wage in 1996.)<p>And now we hear economists fret that Americans, who have been under-saving and over-spending for years, may yet ruin the economy---by saving too much and spending too little.

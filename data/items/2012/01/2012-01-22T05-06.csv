We are here to bring innovative products based around the idea that the most effective study is in short sessions over a longer period of time.<p>Our flagship product, The Door-K, is a dry-erase full-sized door cover custom tailored to a student's courses.  Pretty much a Fathead for education, it contains blocks of choice info from the classes you are taking that you will see every day as you walk out of your room.  By the end of the semester, you'll have your formulas, key terms, and graphs embedded in your brain just like the layout of your room.<p>Check us out, register, fill out our survey: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FWK7B6Z<p>We will send you info on our products as they roll out.",1327211991

I mean, I don't even have a lair in a volcano on a skull-shaped island yet!  You can't seriously expect me to go around and start wars without one.  It simply isn't done.<p>But seriously, I think that bad PR for image-conscious companies with factories that have substandard working conditions is a good way to leverage economic pressure.  Because their brands have value to them, they'll try to restore them by putting pressure on their suppliers to clean up their acts and hopefully that will lead to reforms by driving competition.  None of which involves wars or even government intervention, though it might take a bit of investigative journalism.",1327211963

C++ was still largely pre-Standard in practice.  GCC 3.x (which was the first release line with good C++98 support) was still in its infancy, and most universities still had GCC 2.95 installed until 2004 or 2005.  Java?  Java 1.4 wasn't released until February 2002.  Do you remember Java from those days?  <i>Casts</i>.  Two, three, four casts per line.  Generics wouldn't be introduced until late 2004, at which point Java would become usable.  Python 2.2 was all the rage in 2002.  I don't know about you, but I cry every time I have to write a Python script which works with 2.4 because of a busted old server.  Decorators weren't even a glint in Guido's eye back then.  Source control meant CVS.  <i>CVS</i>.<p>How about the Web?  Well, IE6 was the new thing back in 2002, so there's that.  Phoenix -- later renamed Firebird, later renamed Firefox -- was released late in 2002.  Opera's leading feature was that it would reload your old tabs if you restarted it, which was great because it crashed every 15 minutes.  Ajax was used by, like, two sites.  Webmail meant Yahoo!.  <i>MySpace</i> didn't even exist in 2002, let alone Facebook.  People still used ICQ, although AIM was still more popular.  KaZaA was still spelled with random capital letters in 2002, and people still used it.  ""Warcraft"" meant the hot new game, Warcraft III.<p>Ten years is a <i>really long time</i> in internet time.  I don't think Google or Fogcreek would be hurt in the least by releasing their 10-year-old codebases, because their 10-year-old codebases are damn near useless by modern standards.",1327211204

Once there the financial system is not able to sustain itself without cheap credit it will collapse and a sustained credit deflation will ensue. In this deflation all assets will decrease in price but the difficulty to obtain cash will be harder making them effectively very expensive.<p>This, they explain, will have the effect of making oil cheap to the point that there wont be enough money to invest in maintaining the current infrastructure and even less to invest in green tech. Once the bad debts are cleared and growth returns the true effects of peak oil will be felt everywhere.<p>In summary, they say, dont get your hopes up with clean/green tech. It is too little too late and it simply cannot replace oil.

That's why my criticism was directed at the Tech Review article that totally misinterprets the paper, and indirectly at all of the comments in this thread that make the same mistake. The paper does not describe how gas-pump prices change; it does not describe how any actual market actually works. It does not identify time to react to price signals as the key to well-functioning markets; that is an artifact of the highly stylized model employed.<p>As I wrote in the first line of my comment, the take-away is that cartel-like behavior is <i>possible</i> without direct coordination, not that it is actually happening, ever has happened, or ever will happen. The rest of my comment was meant to point out why we can't draw those conclusions.<p>EDIT: And, by the way, there are lots of other ways to show that cartel-like behavior is possible without concerted price-fixing. Several authors have shown this in a game-theoretic framework, and there is a whole literature on indirect communication among economic competitors that has arisen out of law-and-economics analysis of anti-trust regulation.",1327210689

It would have been far better to do it by law, but there was such a short time before campaigns started.<p>Some of the most important changes introduced by the new system are:<p>- Inability to be a candidate, to people condemned for crimes against humanity (in our case, mainly former members of the dictatorial government from 1976-1983).<p>- A party needs to have at least 0.4% of the electoral roll as its members, to be able to participate in the electoral process.<p><i>- Only physical persons can donate to the campaign. Donations from companies are prohibited.<p>- The government will give money to the parties to develop their respective campaigns in this way: 50% of the total to be divided equally between all parties. The other 50% based on the amount of votes from the last election.<p>- Contracting advertisement in audiovisual media and radio by political groups is prohibited.<p>- Publicity in audiovisual media will be paid by the government, and the function of distributing spaces that can be up to 10 percent of broadcast time among all the contending groups in all media for the purpose of developing their political campaigns is assigned to the National Electoral Directorate; the NED will assign 50% equally between all parties. The other 50% based on the amount of votes from the last election.</i><p>The end result:   Lots of ugly TV spots in the months previous to the election day.

The idea of getting a lobbying group and using them to represent those funding a program gives me the feeling that there's a good chance that many actions won't go further than a first round.  The money goes in, it gets a lobbyist group up and going and then.....what?  It takes on going funding to fight for legislation, I think the model has to work in a manner that is closer to subscriptions so that it can be pushed for to an end.<p>Which brings me to point 2. if you're going to go to a subscription based model, there has to be information shared to everyone, not just those willing to pledge the upper limits.  If you're creating a group to fight for a cause then they need to continually be updated on said cause and given the chance to help further. Otherwise we run into point 1.  Additionally, shouldn't the sharing of information be part of this goal? Why is it that only those that can pay the upper amounts get to hear back?<p>I think ideally what happens is a team works behind the scenes on this project to review cases, put together the information and once a project reaches the 'open the case level', a subsite is setup for the cause, donors are placed on a mailing list, and the lobbyist group is searched for.  A project plan is then put in place to estimate costs and effort so that on going funds can be added to help.<p>Additionally, since lobbyists without any actual ties beyond a pay check aren't really fighting for a cause, individuals funding the group are put in place to help head the 'project'.  This means reviews, putting together updates, and helping with decision making.<p>In the end, the ability for a program like this to raise capital time and time over is only going to be by showing successful efforts.  I think that in it's current form it doesn't have the ability to maintain a fight to that level of success- but I think that with some modifications it could.<p>Interested in seeing how this develops.",1327209921

The reason economics is full of theorems that only hold in highly stylized worlds is that <i>economics is hard.</i><p>Betrand Roehner provides an insightful classification of problems in the natural and social sciences by their level of complexity.[1] Two-body problems (like most of those in classical mechanics) are the least complex. N-body problems in which the interactions are local and the bodies are homogenous (like many problems in statistical mechanics) occupy the next level. At the third level of complexity are homogenous N-body problems with long-range interactions. And at the fourth level are heterogeneous N-body problems; these include lots of hard problems, like regulation of gene expression, morphogenesis ... and pretty much all interesting problems in economics and the social sciences.<p>Yes, I just said economics is harder than physics. (Well, it's harder than the physics physicists have been able to figure out so far.) And the difficultly of the problems is compounded by the difficultly of doing experiments in economics and the social sciences; you can't measure and tinker with a self-contained version of society in a lab somewhere. Is it any surprise then that most of economics doesn't really tell us anything directly applicable to the real world?<p><i>> ... mainstream economists only study basic calculus, linear algebra, and statistics, not ODEs, and don't believe anything they don't understand. A 50 year old professor (or central banker) isn't going to go back to school and sit in a class with sophomore engineers, just to be able to understand what ""complexity theorists"" and ""econophysists"" are talking about, so they just pretend that it doesn't exist. There's no conspiracy, they just don't read or teach anything more mathematically advanced than IS-LM (which is stone age).</i><p>You could not be more wrong. Economists, at least those from good programs, have great quantitative training. Pick up any copy of <i>Econometrica</i> if you don't believe me.[2] The mathematical tools used by financial economists, in particular, are largely the same as those used by statistical physicists, which is why so many physics PhDs end up working in finance. (Brownian motion, power-law distributions, etc. were all first described in an economic context.) Informed criticisms of the profession usually comes from the other side, e.g., that top economics journals are full of mathematical fireworks and devoid of reference to the real world.<p>And IS-LM has not been a part of mainstream macroeconomics since at least the early 1970s. It is still taught in some intro undergrad macro courses (precisely because it requires no mathematical sophistication to understand, I suppose), but it is not a part of the graduate curriculum or a part of the way macroeconomists comprehend the workings of the economy.

Which may not even be totally true, but close enough to make the point.<p>This isn't actually that far from the original intention of patents. It used to be that things were kept as trade secrets and hence lost to the ages, which is why no one knows how to make Damascus steel anymore. On the other hand, if someone leaked your trade secret, you could sue them for breach of contract or something, but once the secret itself was out, it was just free speech and free enterprise for people who <i>didn't</i> sign an NDA with you to go ahead and use it. So trade secrets were both ineffective for the secret-holder (unless they kept them very, very well) and bad for society as a whole (since none of us could use any of the secrets that didn't leak out.)<p>So the patent was invented. Now you had a choice: either your trade secret could remain secret or it could become a patent. If you patented, for instance, your revolutionary manufacturing process for steel, no one in the entire country could legally use that process themselves--at least not until the patent term was up. On the other hand, the process itself was published, and once your patent expired, everyone gained your knowledge.<p>Copyright enters the picture with software in a funny way. If you documented the process of, say, manufacturing steel, the document itself would be copyrighted. Anyone could read that document and then implement the process with no problem. The same is true for, say, the plans to some machine or appliance--the plans themselves would be copyrighted, but that wouldn't prevent you from assembling an actual device. Obviously with software this is different.<p>I actually think that with software, both traditional patents and the copyright process don't really work. Rather, I think software should be subject to the same kind of social contract patents successfully imposed on pre-software inventions: no copyright protection on source or executable code (copyright on documentation or string or graphic resources are acceptable), source and executable code can be ""patented"", which entails a limited-term (5-10 year) monopoly on the use of that source code, but after 5-10 years the code is effectively public domain, and published in perpetuity by the government.",1327208934

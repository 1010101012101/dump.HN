2590758,comment,2587311,2590508,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It's an interesting choice of comparisons, why not use Vera Wang evening gowns? I mean its just fabric right? Except both Vera (who designs lovely evening wear) and Apple aren't actually playing the same game.<p>A more apt comparison would be Windows based laptops. This is because a pre-requisite for this effect to occur is the ability to compete on price. Since everyone who has attempted to make compatible hardware that was cheaper than Apple but ran MacOS has been sued mercilessly into bankruptcy, using Apple in this case fails.<p>Theaters, like MS Windows laptop makers, have a cost they have to bear and they pay a tax for a key ingredient in their product to a third party (the studios, or Microsoft depending on which we're talking about.) The product the consumer buys is a combination of the part the supplier got from someone else, and the part they made themselves. Their margin of course being their revenue above their costs.<p>When, unlike in designer gowns or Apple equipment, there isn't a legal barrier to enter, multiple entities pop up to supply the demand. They compete on quality, feature sets, and price.<p>The less maneuvering room they have around feature sets, the more they compete on quality and price. And the less sensitive the <i>bulk of the market</i> is to quality, they are left competing on price. I'm sure this is really obvious so I won't belabor the point.<p>For me, that leaves the interesting challenge of finding ways to make quality a differentiator in a market with low barriers to entry. If you have any ideas on that I'd love to hear them, they would be the kind of things that let entrepreneurs break into and disrupt existing markets.",1306482924

2590750,comment,2590253,2590348,1,0,jmtame,,,"I think you summed it up pretty well. The post started with the idea of ""how to find cofounders"" as one of the most difficult things founders deal with. I'm challenging the notion that you have to be out there and aggressive about it; instead, take your time with it and allow serendipity to work in your favor. It's a different way of thinking and hopefully something biz students will try out (keep in mind, the main audience for my book is high school and college students).<p>There's also the idea of negative circumstances happening to you which may end up being positive (back to the serendipity theme). The point of this is to try and show people who are in seemingly negative situations that it could turn out very well for them (Steve Jobs reference to connecting the dots). Bad things happen to good people, but luck still has a big role to play, and sometimes it might be beneficial to experiment here: pause your agenda and just go make some friends and be normal instead of trying to control everything. See if it works out better.",1306482620
2590749,comment,2589681,2589681,1,0,ChuckFrank,,,"Under every boom, real change grinds away.  Markets reach maturity when there's no more room for development and instead there is only room for replacement.  Until that point where new business only replaces exiting business, people either unable or unwilling to critically evaluate the quality and magnitude of change keep running in and out of the markets leading to the recurring booms and busts. Instead think of the public introductions of electricity at the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1893, which is comparable to the release of Mosaic 100 years later.  Compared to electricity, we are in 1911, and realize all the things that still haven't been invented yet.  Neither television, nor the internet itself had been invented. So while the booms and busts might swirl around any developing technology, it's vital to remember the key question is not ""is it a bubble?"" instead it is ""where am I going?"" & ""where are we going?"" In short Vision > Bubble.  Now, since the real estate market is still slumbering, domestic manufacturing continues it's long decline, the financial markets have lost their public trustworthiness, the media will naturally follow what they think the hottest emerging segments are --> Bio Tech, Green Tech, Online Tech -- because that is their mission. So let's just promise to keep in mind that any report with the words boom, bust, bubble in them are not about the vision, or about the real changes that the technology actually brings. Those stories will be about the boom, bust and bubble itself. By ignoring those stories, and ignoring the related bubbles we can actually create the technological changes that we all promise in our work.",1306482619

They are both serialisation formats that make you put data into their own structure, a tree with attributes for XML and lists and dictionaries for JSON.
Exactly two types exist in XML: tree and text. And exactly six types exist in JSON: list, dictionary, string, number, boolean and null.<p>What XML has that JSON doesn't is a solution for automating validation called XML Schema.",1306480582

Facebook's developers all have a ""karma"" rating that is tracked through the code review system. Rossi can increase or decrease a developer's karma by clicking on thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons that appear next to the developer's name in a Web-based dashboard.<p>> The thumbs-up icon in Rossi's tool is the same one used for the ""like"" function on the social networking site. The thumbs-down image is the same icon, but upside down. When Rossi showed me the icons, he joked that he's the only person in the world who has a Facebook ""dislike"" button.<p>To me this was the most interesting part that whole piece. I've long thought Facebook could do with a ""dislike"" button for everyone. Keep it private, but let it affect what you see from whom, and how.",1349747967

4629571,comment,4629158,4629519,4,0,vecter,,,"That's a false premise. The ""purpose"" of capital markets isn't to ""serve society"" any more so than the ""purpose"" of restaurants is to ""serve food"". Restaurants (and any other businesses for that matter) exist to generate profits. They merely satisfy that goal by serving food, but it could be done a million other ways.<p>The stock market exists not because of some idealized goal of serving society, but because companies want to sell partial ownership and transfer risk from themselves to the public in exchange for potential future returns on that investment. Anyone member of the public who purchases stock in a company should understand that agreement. It also has secondary benefits like providing liquidity for employees, etc., but the New York Stock Exchange wasn't founded with that purpose in mind. In other words, the stock market doesn't <i>owe</i> you anything.<p>That point aside, could you clarify how HFT hurts you? If your goal is to use stock markets as an investment vehicle, then your time horizon should be on the order of months and years, not seconds. If that's the case, then HFT has no impact on you whatsoever. If you <i>do</i> want to play in the second time range, then my analogy with F1 racing is perfectly applicable and there's no justification for your complaint.",1349747924
4629570,comment,4629283,4629432,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Tough to say. For Ridejoy in particular, regulation could be a challenge, because it will be argued that by matching drivers with underused vehicles, there's an implicit promise that the vehicles are roadworthy and so on. Sure, you can invite users of the service to waive some of their rights or voluntarily accept a degree of risk and uncertainty to use the service, but courts sometimes view such arrangements as contracts of adhesion - tilted in favor of the offeror by virtue of the fact that a large organization has substantially more bargaining power than an individual, who is left with little choice but to accept or reject terms rather than negotiate them.<p>I don't have a strong opinion on how this should turn out and am not an attorney. Rules that limit industry like this are sometimes the result of regulatory capture, but are equally often the result of consumer pressure following malfeasance by unscrupulous service providers some time in the past. Certainly such rules represent an increase in red tape, but that doesn't mean they're inherently bad; one might argue that they're an unavoidable corollary of a complex technological society, reflective of the challenges faced by its members - just as product liability rules are reflective of industrialization's severance of the traditional relationship consumer and producer that used to exist at the local level (blacksmiths, carpenters, <i>et al.</i>).<p>Incidentally, I hope people won't interpret the CPUC's representatives mention of enforcement mechanisms as a threat. Spokespersons for public bodies like this are duty-bound to cite the way the law actually operates, rather than make policy statements about how it should operate. So discussion of enforcement mechanisms is no more than a restatement of fact in response to journalistic inquiry.",1349747898

4629565,comment,4628591,4628788,4,0,wamatt,,,"Good stuff OP, nice to see Bayesian getting more attention recently. However, after reading your blog post, I can't help get the feeling this is how a natural frequentist would approach the problem. This method is effectively relying on known, statistical record of past events to form the priors.<p>Often a more useful and appropriate construct in the Bayesian world, is the use of a belief network or <i>Bayesian Network</i>. This is a probabilistic directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes priors, often in the form of <i>subjective</i> beliefs (yes subjectivity can be useful), including specific domain knowledge.<p>Common example: Consider a naive Bayesian classifier (a specialized form of belief network) that identifies individual pieces of spam. Do we arrive at the spam score by entering the probability of past events into a simple model based of the Bayes theorem formula?<p>No, it's trained using the vast amount of domain knowledge and pattern recognition (through our experience and own estimation of what 'spam' is) encoded in our minds, that provide the priors. Thus, even though there is a large amount of subjectivity involved, the overall result can objectively be measured, within a given utility function. Incidentally, this is often what makes many hardcore empiricists 'nervous', and hence avoid belief networks altogether.<p>Coming back to the Falcon 9: A piece of prior information outside the scope of historic safety records, for example, one of the lead engineers having a nagging doubt about a particular technical risk based on some observed phenomenon, could have an impact on the real world probability of the next event being a failure. (Which is a pretty useful thing to know!)<p>In fact, this exact scenario happened in 2003 with the disastrous destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia. [1] An engineer spotted something wrong on previous flights, but management failed to heed the warning[2]. This could quite possibly have been averted, if a risk mitigation model were in place to account for such evidence.<p>Looking forward, it's quite possible to imagine a future where this decision making has been outsourced to a sophisticated AI based off a Bayes net, with far more accurate real world modeling of risk and failure probabilities, outclassing the amount of evidence and a human or committee could possibly hope to compete with.<p>While I've nothing against frequentist approaches (albeit Bayesian naturally makes more intuitive sense to me), a minor drawback is the reliance on the past to predict the future. For example if you had safety records on 1 million previous flights, then one might be tempted to say, ""well that's that then, we now know objectively the probability of failures in the future -- end of story"". But, the 1 000 001 flight may have been designed to fly on a completely different type of technology, that will change significantly change the safety record of space flight going forward for the next ""x"" years. Thus using a Bayesian approach account for all relevant priors, it would in theory be possible to reflect a more accurate probability for the 1 000 001 flight, <i>before</i> it took place.<p>Lastly Bayes nets are not the best tool for every job, and do have drawbacks in certain situations. They are vulnerable to things like Bayesian poisoning or confirmation bias. A Bayesian approach is only as useful as the ongoing real world relevancy and accuracy of the priors. As the old adage goes, GIGO - garbage in, garbage out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/jun/22/spaceexploration.columbia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2003/jun/22/spaceexplorati...</a>",1349747764

4629561,comment,4629283,4629283,17,0,rprasad,,,"I know people in the echo chamber don't like to hear this, but ridesharing is not an innovation.  Los Angeles and Chicago have had ridesharing programs for at least a decade.  Hell, even Cleveland had a ridesharing program years before Uber or Lyft were founded (and that was how I got around Cleveland in law school).<p>Uber and Lyft call themselves ""ridesharing"" programs where passengers ""donate"" money to a driver who ""just happens"" to be going to the same destination as his passengers but who will not remain at that destination and who will probably pick up more passengers shortly thereafter and ""coincidentally"" drive them to their desired location in exchange for a ""donation.""  Uber and Lyft can use all the euphemisms they want, but they what they are is the very definition of a for-hire car service.<p>The fact that they straddle the line between two types of regulated car services (cabs and limos/""charter car"") does not change the essence of the commercial transaction that takes place.  The fact that a mobile app or website is used to arrange the transaction instead of a phone call does not change the essence of the commercial transaction that takes place.<p>Regulations on cars-for-hire exist for a reason: to protect the safety of passengers by ensuring a minimal level of competence <i>and to ensure recompense</i> via adequate capital or insurance in the event of an accident.  These regulations work remarkably well, which is why so many people think they are unnecessary.",1349747726

    from pylab import *
    failures = [binom(9,p).rvs() for p in beta(1,1,1e5) if binom(9,p).rvs() == 1]
    hist(failures, bins=9, range=(0,9))
    show()
</code></pre>
The way this code works is it first picks a `p` from the prior. This `p` represents the failure probability for a single engine. Then we simulate the number of engines that fail when you have 9 of them, and filter out just the worlds where that number is equal to 1 as in the SpaceX launch. Or equivalently, we annihilate all the worlds that have a different observation than ours -- this is a central tenet in Bayesian statistics in contrast to frequentist statistics: we only base our inferences on the things that happened and not on things that hypothetically could have happened but didn't. In a slogan you could say ""our fantasies are irrelevant"". Then in the worlds that remain, where the same observation was made as in our world, we simulate the number of engines that fail on a new rocket launch and collect the results in a histogram.<p>So the posterior probability on the entire rocket failing for uniform prior is around 25%. Uniform prior means that you believe that all single engine failure probabilities are equally likely: you think it's equally likely that engines fail with 10% probability as with 63% probability.  Tweak the first two parameters to beta to change your prior belief. If you've seen n engines fail in your life and k engines succeed, then setting the first parameter to n+1 and the second to k+1 is a reasonable choice (so the current setting corresponds to not having seen any rocket launches prior to this one). For example if you've seen 2 engines fail and 99 engines succeed you use `beta(3,100,1e5)`: <a href=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/388822/rocketfailuredistr_for_optimists.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/388822/rocketfailuredistr_for_optim...</a> Hardly any probability mass left for entire rocket failure :)",1349745810

Prospective double-blind studies are virtually unheard of in psychology because of ethical issues.<p>Why do you believe this to be the only valid form of scientific study? Do you hold all disciplines to this standard?<p>>Yes, true, which is why, in a scientific sense, we don't know anything about these topics.<p>We know that certain assessments reliably indicate the presence of depression. We know certain conditions reliably induce depression. We know certain therapies reliably relieve depression. We know certain risk factors lead to greater likelihood of depression.<p>>For example, it has recently been determined by way of a meta-analysis that the many antidepressant studies, taken as a whole, contradict each other, and the conclusion is that antidepressants don't work.<p>>In layman's language, ""there is no scientific evidence to support the conclusion that antidepressants actually do anything.""<p>Can you explain to me how science can decide one way or another on matters concerning depression if such things are inscrutable to the scientific method?",1349744977

It's definitely in their best interest for products to be easily identifiable, and they're already doing work on it in a different way with Price Check[1].<p>Unfortunately there are other companies with a strong incentive to make identifying specific products as difficult as possible[2]. And clothing companies have never been good about sticking with a specific product anyway. I got a Ralph Lauren suit last year that I liked enough to consider ordering another one, but they had already stopped making that style. Maybe dresses or something I could understand, but men's suits?<p>If you can't buy a product even if you can identify it, then what's the point? Do you have any thoughts on how to get around this problem? One idea that comes to mind is that you could use your data to build a ranking of how long clothing companies (or any companies) stick with their products. I'd certainly find it useful.<p>Best of luck!<p>[1] <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.pricecheck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.pri...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204624204577177242516227440.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405297020462420457717...</a>",1349744559

Are you really asking that question seriously?<p>I think, contrary to your suggestion, that plenty of people are already fed up with the same old movie sequels and annual releases by the same computer game franchises and so on. But that's what happens when the system doesn't effectively support those who would create more interesting alternatives, which typically aren't as profitable on a first outing but cost more to produce.

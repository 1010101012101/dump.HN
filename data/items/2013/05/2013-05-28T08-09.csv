5778952,comment,5775573,5775573,8,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"Speaking for myself, I can perceive a few problems with the tech industry: one more (but not entirely) individual,  one more (but not entirely) cultural, and one more (but not entirely) legal/economic.<p>The cultural one is simply that Silicon Valley and the tech sector in general currently constitute one of the last remaining vestiges of the upper-middle class and the petite bourgeoisie in an otherwise recessionary and degrading Western society.  Others refer to us occasionally as the ""Tech Sector Master Race"".  Forgive the 4chan slang, but that <i>is</i> how we come across sometimes: as a little nerdy subculture that smugly walks through a world we don't quite belong to, demanding coffee and consumer electronics and thinking about our investment accounts while other people think about making rent.  And the worse the rest of society gets, the worse this effect will become.  See below.<p>The individual one is that, frankly, I have too easy a time contenting myself with my gadgetry to see wide-open markets, and when I do see an idea, I expect the corporate behemoths to colonize it first.  An undergrad here at Technion once came and talked to me about starting a groceries-delivery service here in Israel.  I immediately thought of Stop&Shop's Peapod, before realizing we don't have anything like that here.  Then my next thought was, ""What, people can't be bothered to go to the market?""  It's easy to overlook opportunities to solve others' pain points just because <i>you personally</i> don't have a lot of pain points (which ties right back in to techies being so massively fortunate!).<p>The legal/economic one is that productizing technology has gotten <i>very hard</i>.  I'm always glad to see more hardware start-ups and such, but people often hesitate to commit money to unknown companies.  Then software is more and more functionally impossible to sell in a shrink-wrapped box as a product (due to piracy and upgrades), people hate advertisements, non-corporate users hate paying subscription fees for software because they think they bought their copy, and people are still demanding ever more quality for fixed or shrinking prices.  Lastly, technology has gotten less and less ""do it yourself"" and more and more ""black box"", pushing all kinds of things underground.  Overall, the path from tinkering to a product to a sale to tinkering again has gotten longer, and that's what drives the endless rounds of ""social-mobile-local Big Data cat-picture analytics apps"".  And of course, this also goes right back to large parts of society being unable to afford innovative luxury goods produced by the tech sector.  A game console that costs $400 now instead of $200 ten years ago wouldn't be that much of a problem if the cost of living had stayed the same or if wages had doubled (before inflation, even).  They haven't.<p>So until we find some ways to fix this stuff, Silicon Valley is going to be stuck catering to the one audience who will consistently buy into Silicon Valley, that being Silicon Valley.",1369731343

It requires maintaining a separate crontab file for your app. Wit schedule you can keep everything in pure Python.<p>- cron is per machine. Multiple app servers require locks of some sort to prevent job duplication. To solve this, we could put triggered jobs on a shared jobqueue (beanstalkc, resque, ...) and have them processed by several workers.<p>- cron's syntax, while powerful, can be difficult to understand and maintain. Schedule provides an easy to read syntax based on the builder pattern, e.g. ""schedule.every(2).hours.do(job, args)""<p>Much of this was said in better words by Addam Wiggins: <a href=""http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/4/13/rethinking_cron/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/4/13/rethinking_cron/</a><p>I wrote schedule because I needed a lightweight scheduling solution for a Python web service backend.

If all he does is not go to the potty and you have to work at understanding him then things may not be as bad as they seem and a 'crash program' to advance the child to match his peers may not be what's called for. I've seen kids that were potty trained later than this and I know at least several children that are clever but hard to understand at that age and nobody thinks of them as 'behind in terms of development'.<p>There is no set schedule here, if you are really worried about this - and it seems that you are - you might want to check with local professionals to see if he's really as behind as you think and if a crash program to remedy this is what is called for or a more sedate pace slightly above normal until things are in line again.<p>As with others here: HN is not the right place to look for advice on this, we're not exactly childcare professionals (even if some of us are dads and moms). My 'qualifications' are that I'm a father of three tri-lingual children and that at the age of three they all seemed to be behind a bit in terms of speech development because of that.<p>The most important thing to take away from this thread is the 'there is no rush' bit, I second that wholeheartedly, better a happy child that's a bit behind than a frustrated child trying to make up because of pressure.<p>Much good luck!",1369728556

Afghanistan is not a major oil producer.<p>It's about keeping oil flowing - at least being extracted if not sold. But yes in Afghanistan that is currently more pipelines than oil-wells. The TAPI pipeline for instance is proposed to move huge amount of Turkmeni oil through Afghanistan.<p>> indeed the main contract to develop fields there was signed by the Chinese.<p>Sure. Why not? The goal is to keep oil flowing now, not (rationally) hoarded. Anything other than leaving it in the ground is fine,<p>But anyways - the point wasn't that 100% of the reason was oil, because the ability to use their airspace, have lasting bases, etc, is also of huge value. My point was that the official reasons were specifically untrue - almost zero utility came pursing from the stated reasons for the invasions - Bin Laden and WMDs (in Iraq). Mainly, of course, because both reasons were essentially fictions.<p>> ... and the people from the oil reserves (shut the taps off, see the price skyrocket ...<p>I think ultimately they had roughly the same desires for Iraqi oil: get it the hell out of Iraqi/neighboring soil as quickly as possible before the inconvenient locals have anything to say about it. Even if they have to ""share"" with them<p>And then, yes some people want to play it smart and hoard to watch the prices rise. But none of them wanted an economic meltdown so their policy isn't going to be to stop selling oil, but to stop selling their oil and make the other guy sell his. Having the USA (and select allies) being the last ones with oil is the winning position for both factions (as you describe it) of the Bush government - they merely differed on mid-game strategy.",1369728448

They spend time drawing a pretty looking scrollbar.<p>When it comes to the implementation personally I think it still better to have a scrollbar that functions the way you expect it to, even if it looks a little different, rather than ending up with many different reimplementations of the scrollbar by different programmers.",1428335998

Hackathons are too contrived since the goal is to have a finished product in 24 ~ 48 hours. Every time I have done one I throw away all the &quot;Danger, Bad practice&quot; signals from my sub conscience and work towards finishing the product/idea. Things that are important like maintainability (even if your hack is successful, and get investor funding you want to re-write it properly), coupling, testing, documentation, API, Memory profiling, Logging, performance optimizations, design patterns are thrown out the window to get that idyllic prototype out. Even working as a team, there is very little you gain from spending 48 hours with (mostly unknown) individuals than it is for your peers in a job where you actually have a favor economy.<p>And I don&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t any value on hack-a-thons. I think you&#x27;re right on dealing with deadline pressures and the ability of working yourself out of a problem in a pinch are valuable skills.

The average Goldman Sachs employee earns around $500,000 per year. If someone joined Goldman and donated half of his earnings to Against Malaria Foundation, that would be about enough to save 100 lives per year (or more accurately, saving 4000 QALYs), plus likely have substantial positive flow-through effects. For Earning to Give at Goldman to be net harmful, the marginal employee would need to be causing the death of a hundred people each year. This would mean that Goldman Sachs employees are several orders of magnitude more deadly than American service people in Iraq.<p>Goldman has 32,000 employees. An upper bound for the harm caused by the marginal employee is thus the total harm caused divided by 32,000. For the harm to outweigh the good, Goldman would therefore have to be killing at least 3.2 million young people each year, or doing something else that is similarly harmful. That would mean that Goldman Sachs would need to be responsible for around 5% of all deaths in the world. Bear in mind that Goldman Sachs only makes up 22% of American investment banking, and 3% of the American financial industry - if the rest of finance is similarly bad, then it would imply that finance is doing something as bad as causing all the deaths in the world.&quot;",1428335739

In my personal experience, if I need something right now (find an angel to give me $250K, find a developer to write my MVP), it won&#x27;t work. However, people I met 6 months ago, who I found interesting (but had no particular need for at the time), turn out to be a life saver.<p>Don&#x27;t be selfish: network for others too. If the person you are talking to is looking for something specific, and you happen to know someone who could help, offer to make the introduction (assuming both parties pass your quality threshold).<p>Quality of events matter: if you are a new entrepreneur and doesn&#x27;t even know what vesting or 83(b) is, you need to chat to people to catch up to the average level of entrepreneurs around where you are. At some point, you will &quot;graduate&quot; from those events. You can tell because when that happens, you can help pretty much everyone at that event with confidence. When that happens, you need to move to higher quality/more selective events. Pro tip: if there is no such event near you, start one.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thestartupconference.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thestartupconference.com</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://colunchers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colunchers.com</a>",1428334463

Take it as you will.<p>> <i>Another trait, it took me a while to notice. I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don&#x27;t know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, ``The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.&#x27;&#x27; I don&#x27;t know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss fame.</i><p>(Edit: Originally, incorrectly thought this was from Feynman)<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html</a>",1428334401

When I personally saw what extreme poverty was, it changed the course of my life and future career decisions. So, the $1000 plane ticket and 10 days in a rural, high-need area allowed me to look outside the bubble of American extravagance I had grown up in.<p>It is one thing to rationally know that people are without food and basic medicine through the reading I did or videos I watched. It is another to be in a high-need community and find myself trying to explain to a father that I just ran out of the antibiotics he needed to help his sick child fight an infection. Of course it would have been more effective to not buy the plane ticket and ship $1000 more of antibiotics to the community, but that is the cost we (myself and the community) paid to change a lifetime of decisions I would make as a privileged American. The cost sickens me, but it is the reality I have come to understand.<p>Emotional connections are powerful, but they are difficult to form without the personal connection. My hope is that as technology improves, we will be able to build empathy more effectively even without the aforementioned expensive plane ticket. Perhaps then we will be more hesitant about war and more vigorous in helping refugees, victims of natural disasters, and others.",1428334366

It&#x27;s one of the reasons college hackathons are so compelling - people aren&#x27;t there with their startups, it&#x27;s students looking to learn. I think sometimes people judge student hackathons based on corporate hackathons they&#x27;ve been to but they are fundamentally very different.<p>Jacob is right, big prizes can suck. I&#x27;d love to see fewer big prizes at hackathons. Having some small stuff so people feel accomplished and valued is nice though. Jon Gottfried has a really good article about this[1].<p>I go to a lot of student hackathons and generally people are there for learning - not competition. They&#x27;re certainly not there for &quot;boozing up&quot;!<p>And of course hackathon projects amount to nothing 99% of the time. That&#x27;s not a problem. That&#x27;s totally to be expected from 24 hours of hastily put together code. The value students get is learning about idea generation, working with others, managing a project, how to use the libraries, frameworks, and APIs, how to work to a deadline, how to debug, how to do version control, how to deploy, how to test and improve your work, how to present your work to others, and much more. And I don&#x27;t think companies or VCs who attend really expect to find a next Facebook - they&#x27;re probably more concerned with just meeting the kind of students who would rather spend a weekend building stuff instead of boozing. Furthermore, hackathons don&#x27;t undermine the value of sustained effort on hard technical problems - but they can be the first step for students starting to work on technology outside of their courses.<p>You&#x27;re all totally right that large prizes suck and pitchathons suck. Most student hackathons do a pretty good job of staying away from those (though some could do better for sure). As Jacob said, &quot;hackathons should be about coding something cool, not winning, networking, or partying&quot; - I&#x27;ve honestly never been to a student hackathon where that wasn&#x27;t the case. So I&#x27;d be careful about throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.mlh.io/are-hackathon-prizes-the-worst-thing-since-moldy-sliced-bread-04-18-2014"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.mlh.io/are-hackathon-prizes-the-worst-thing-sinc...</a>",1428334307

The only risks are scientific, like the obvious potential loss of diversity of the gene pool as we converge on certain universal traits.<p>From another perspective, what if we could identify genes which bring the value of a trait below the baseline?

I&#x27;ll bite, though.<p>#1 The Internal Job: the real mistake was in having production credentials (i.e., the keys to the generators) inside the codebase.  The keys should have been generated when the software was deployed.  Hardcoded information should be kept to a minimum, or ideally eliminated altogether.<p>#2 Breaching the Version Control Process: there&#x27;s not really enough information here to figure out the actual issue.  Someone changed a version number, and that caused a bug to reappear?  That sounds like #ifdefs or similar, where setting a version number can cause code to be included or excluded.  Don&#x27;t do that: tag your versions in your VCS, and eliminate dead code ruthlessly.  If you really need to get it back, you can always use your VCS to restore a particular versions&#x27; code.<p>#3 Exposing from the Cloud: git&#x27;s great; GitHub&#x27;s great; not knowing to keep your repos private is…not so great.  Also, pretty damned easy to avoid.  Any private VCS would work here, to include git repos on a filesystem.<p>RhodeCode might be neat; it might not be.  No doubt it could possibly provide for a lot of stuff out of the box.  At the end of the day, though, you can&#x27;t replace smart people executing well-designed processes with software; software is only good for replacing drones executing dumb processes.",1428332499

Of course there was a lot of funding from Musk (is this the seed funding in &#x27;06?), but very impressed to see them build out very successful and complicated products with only a few hundred million before 2015. Looks like they are now confident enough in their process and goals to begin accepting lot&#x27;s of venture capital.<p>It also seems to me that SpaceX should not be in this list. Being a company that focuses on physical technologies, it is almost a different beast altogether than the rest of the software-based group. Hard to compare it&#x27;s company and funding structure to the others when it involves a much more complicated logistical chain, development period, and roll out.<p>EDIT: SpaceX has received almost $1 billion in funding from NASA over the years. It&#x27;s unclear to me, however, how this funding works. Is it an up-front payment for future launches, or purely award money?",1428332464

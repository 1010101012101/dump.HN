To wit:<p>> This may well be true, but my own suspicion is that it had as much to do with Apple having hundreds of core system developers already familiar with the C++ APIs, and a limited timeframe to get Mac OS X released.<p>Actually, NeXT already had a perfectly cromulent Cocoa-based ""Finder"", called the Workspace Manager.  This was the program used in NeXTSTEP and later in Rhapsody.  Apple threw it away and replaced it with a Carbon Finder built in-house.  They were quite specific as to the reason: to guarantee that Carbon was bullet-proof, Apple built the Finder ""to eat their own dog food"" (though he didn't originate the term at Apple, I think Steve started using it too).<p>> [regarding UFS] In order to maintain compatibility. And it wasn't just ported code -- HFS+ support was rewritten from the ground up as a UNIX file system. Surprisingly, the result wasn't a delicate hack, and the fact that we're still using it today (on iOS too!) speaks to the engineering capability of Apple. (And NeXT, since it's all one big family now.)<p>It wasn't just compatibility.  Though it was case-preserving :-(, HFS+ had some big advantages over UFS.  It supported Unicode.  It supported metadata.  It supported soft links which were preserved in removable media.  It had much better networked file support.  And so on.<p>Also: IIRC HFS+ wasn't rewritten from the ground up.  Apple already long had a version of it running on UNIX systems they had developed in-house.<p>> Quicktime was also ported to Windows.<p>The point is, NeXT already had a multimedia, sound, and (limited) video system.  It was famous for its sound system in particular.  But (Carbon) Quicktime was better.  So they used it instead.<p>> In order to maintain compatibility. The recommended way to write games on Mac OS X has always been the OpenGL APIs, and you can hardly describe OpenGL as a legacy Mac technology.<p>You absolutely can!  Porting OpenGL involves a huge number of low-level ties to the operating system.  NeXT had its own 3D facilities as well (OpenGL under NeXTSTEP, and Display Renderman), which were entirely tossed out in favor of the ""legacy"" OS 9 version.<p>> Java came from Sun.<p>On early OS X, the bulk of the Java facility came from Apple.  Sun didn't support the Java port at all.  NeXTSTEP, or more properly OpenStep, had a Java port from Sun which was entirely replaced with the OS 9 Java version.<p>> Font handling in Mac OS X is part of Quartz, a new technology developed for OS X.<p>Not correct.  Font and typographic engine technology was derived from ATSUI, Apple's advanced typography system.  And why wouldn't they?  It was the best in the world.<p>Look, I don't dispute, by any stretch, the notion that the crucial parts of OS X were NeXTSTEP.  I'm a NeXTSTEP guy!  But your dismissal of Carbon and OS 9 technologies that found their way into OS X is both overly casual and in many cases simply false.  To this day OS X still has a huge number of OS 9 technologies embedded in it not because of compatibility, or just because of compatibility, but because they were the best technology.

As the site is very heavy with interactions, we decided to use Backbone.js to keep things organized and jQuery for updating states, ajax calls, keeping the DOM updated throughout etc. We use Socket.IO as the data transport between server and client.<p>For animations, we use CSS3 animations as much as possible for the non-essential elements to make use of hardware accelerated animations. However the video fade-in and fade-out effect is done using jQuery though... I haven't figure out an easy way to do that with CSS3 yet and keep it consistant across browsers, it's tough to keep the timing right, lol.<p>Personally I think Backbone.JS and jQuery are a match made in heaven. In fact Backbone.js is built with jQuery or Sizzle in mind. The latest Backbone.js supports caching of view elements as well (with the ""this.$el"") and event delegation with $.fn.on and $.fn.off, keeping the frontend fast and efficient. :)<p>Comments are always welcome! :D",1329320100

3594445,comment,3593748,3594041,2,0,jay-pinkman,,,"> Wait a moment. DBus is not a 'gui thing'.
yeah, you are right. i just meant to say that it's deeply connected with gui stuff and not that much with cli. the only thing i desperately needed DBus for was hardware management. i don't mind at all having dbus daemon running in background for that very purpose. when it gets to managing system daemons DBus makes me a little bit nervous - compared to dead simple bash scripts used in Arch DBus is a quite complex beast. mostly when it comes to debugging. but i can eat that.<p>what i can't stand is when an app that's only supposed to display image files depends on a whole lot of other completely unrelated components exposed via DBus and buried into some desktop so deeply that you need to install a huge part of that desktop just in order to make that little app happy.<p>what the hell is wrong with 'do one thing and do it well'? i don't need 'less integration points' - i need integration implemented on a higher, not lower level of abstraction. let me clarify this. let's suppose you want your image viewer to add paths to recently viewed pics to some database and also let you post them to your twitter account. you can write a viewer that depends on zeitgeist for storing paths and on some other funky DBus interface to work with twitter. you'll probably end up with a program that works in Ubuntu but not in another environment that doesn't provide zeitgeist or that funky twitter interface or DBus. but you could go another way:<p>1. write a program that only displays images passed to it as command-line arguments
2. write a wrapper that passes paths to zeitgeist
3. write a twitter app that handles posting<p>now your viewer works on systems with no DBus - good. the wrapper can be extended to handle any program - when the user selects a file it passes the path to that file to zeitgeist and invokes the program registered to handle files of that type. to post your pics to twitter you could write a program that displays a form for posting and uses your viewer (or any other program registered for image/png|jpg|etc) to display a preview on it. anyway just viewing and just posting are different actions and you don't need those mixed up. if while viewing an image you suddenly decide to post it you could close the viewer and open the app for posting - the path to the image file (recent file) can be read from zeitgeist. you can even integrate the 'recent documents' thing into the zeitgeist wrapper. or use some other approach to streamline things.<p>that's the unix way and that's how DEs could implement their reach interfaces. this would make it easy to integrate programs into desktops and preserve their 'freedom'. but DEs guys decided it's much better to trap apps into their DEs. i see it as a failure to introduce proper abstractions.<p>> I've no love for Ubuntu, but claiming that you cannot easily (okay - define that) learn its ways and how to fix or customize it yourself? I think you should reconsider that part..<p>man, just stick with Arch for a while:) you'll know what i'm talking about. system configuration via <i>simple</i> plain text files, simple daemon management, nothing is forced on you, if you edit some configuration file there's little chance that some gui (or non-gui) tool will mess with that file without warning you... well, let's just leave it at that. now i'll go get some sleep. no, wait! one more thing:<p>i gave up trying to manage any system-level stuff the way i want. i don't care anymore how things are managed underthehood in Ubuntu, Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc. i just stick with my development tools that work everywhere and try not to write programs that depend on DBus interfaces (except hardware-related ones). for all the rest i just use what's provided by the distro.",1329318233

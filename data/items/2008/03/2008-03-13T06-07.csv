I completed Thau's javascript tutorial and the advanced version (both at webmonkey.com), and from there I got a really nice start (without knowing it).<p>If you combine a simple introduction like that with plenty of exploration with Firebug, and have a strong motivation -like making a kick-ass webpage for yourself-, you are on your way,",1205390646

And every time, tell them no thank you.</i><p>A year after I turned down Google's offer, I started getting poked repeatedly by Google recruiters (I'm guessing that after a year, the new employee referral bonus is up for grabs again).  I complained to a friend of mine who works at Google, and he had someone put ""DO NOT CONTACT"" on my file -- and I haven't had a single email from their recruiters since.  I don't know if you can get the same thing added to your file, but it might be worth asking.",1205390110

Learning a library isn't half as useful as learning the language.<p>So, get a copy of O'Reily Definitive guide, Start working through that.

135802,comment,135666,135735,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Did you refuse a job offer from Google?</i><p>Yes.<p><i>If so, would you tell us why?</i><p>Several reasons, in no particular order: 1. The interview process was completely and utterly broken; among other things, Google changed their mind about which position I was applying for 3 times without consulting me.  2. The job offer (for a position which would have required that I move from Canada to the US) arrived shortly after the US Senate voted away the right of Habeas Corpus.  3. I was interested in developing a system for online encrypted backups, and I was talking to someone who told me that his boss would be interested in licensing some of my work (the licensing didn't end up happening -- a draft MOU ended up arriving two months late which was completely different to what had been discussed in person -- but I decided to go ahead with my work anyway).  4. While I was told that my suggested choice of research projects ""would be ok"" (I was offered a research position), there was a clear lack of enthusiasm for it; and similarly I had no enthusiasm for the fields of research Google's director of research mentioned.<p>In short, they screwed up the recruiting process; the job location wasn't ideal; I had another interesting option; and our interests didn't fit very well.",1205389520

And every time, tell them no thank you. In the beginning you'll be polite, after three years you'll ask them politely to go pound sand.<p>Why? I have many friends that work there. I have many friends that work there only because they hope it'll get better once they make it into the ""inner circle"". These are not people who work on podunk projects, think indexing, crawling, gmail.<p>Further, these same friends are hyper paranoid that they'll let something slip in good ol technical banter that we used to do; because google is soo damn secretive and the penalties range from simple hazing to termination if their slip of the lip was known (and I'm not talking about it showing up on techcrunch or vallywag or even a personal blog).",1205389194

Real-world work makes you rusty.</i><p>Those quotes make it sound like Google's interview process is biased toward people who know a lot of basic-CS trivia.  If real-world work makes you rusty, doesn't that imply that the interview is favoring people who have studied up on certain things such that they know them better than they actually need to?  I would agree that a good candidate should have been familiar with the details of everything Yegge mentions at some point.  But is there really much value in knowing these things ""cold"", rather than merely knowing them ""warm""?",1205388872

Some portion of it will be the encrypted hidden partition, which is also statistically random. It is mathematically impossible to prove that any of that random data is actually an encrypted hidden disk. The only way to open it is to use the correct key, which is indistinguishable from the other key which simply unlocks the normal, clean partition, which is also encrypted.<p>When the police demand the key from you, you give them the one that unlocks the clean partition. Now, at this point it <i>doesn't matter</i> if they don't believe you, it doesn't matter if they know all about truecrypt and hidden partitions, there is no way for them to prove in a court of law or otherwise that there is a hidden partition there.

2336242,comment,2334939,2335089,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"When I taught myself to program, I learned a functional language, in no small part because the language that I was learning was not object oriented.  After some time, my code was starting to turn into spaghetti, so I started enforcing a rule where I put functions that operated on like data in separate files, and created abstractions so in my primary program flow I could work at a high level to keep things clean and understandable.  When I was taught about objects they weren't very easy to understand, but when I connected the dots and saw it was what I was already doing, plus state, it all came together.  I don't think that most educators do a good job explaining how OOP can really help you, they just start rambling about re-usability and polymorphism.  I knew how to program, so I could understand why you would want these things, but to a newcomer they must seem meaningless and unapproachable.<p>If I were teaching, I wouldn't start new programmers with OOP, but I would bring them there quickly.  Imagine an assignment where you have the students model a car, a stop sign, and a traffic light, and their interactions on a closed course.  I'd have the students model the interactions using ruby hashes (e.g. car = {:color => 'blue', :state => 'stopped', :stop_time_required => 1}, traffic_light = {:color => 'red', :stop_time_required => 30}), and a series of functions for the first assignment, where the program prints what happens as it encounters a pre-defined course.  This should result in some pretty crappy spaghetti code.  For the next assignment, I'd have them clean up the structure of the program, separating the code into logical units based on what the code is operating on, a car, a red light, a stop sign.  Lastly, I'd introduce OOP and have them update the code for OOP.  It should take a lot less code to do the same thing, and it should be a lot cleaner.  Polymorphism can be addressed by instructing the students that red light and stop sign are both traffic control devices, and having them implement to_s on each class to clean up their string handling code.<p>OOP can make lots of sense when it's presented as a time saving measure.  However, especially in Java classes, it tends to start will a wall of code thirty lines long to print ""Hello World"", with the direction to ignore everything else.  It would probably be better to start simple, with a 1 line program (e.g. puts 'Hello World'), and work up from there.  That's not to say Ruby is the right language, it's probably a good starter language, but a strictly typed lower level language would probably be better once they get the hang of things.  The beauty of ruby is that you can create useful code quickly, but you still need to be able to understand what's going on under the hood.<p>The two classes I learned the most from were a digital hardware class, and a assembly course.  In the hardware course, the professor gave me a FPGA to work with after he saw I understood digital logic very well, and on that FPGA I implemented a basic instruction set, including jump, which could be entered using toggle switches, executed using a push button, with results output to a lcd.  In the assembly course, the professor spent a great deal of effort manually compiling c to assembly, and explaining why.  He was on the ANSI-C committee, and worked full time writing assembly for spacecraft at NASA, so offered a very unique prospective, and quite a bit of insight.",1300373378

2336228,story,,,56,41,philipDS,"Tell HN: Why I want to start a startup",,"I love my life. No kidding. I do. I'm a young guy in his early twenties and I'm doing great in college. I'm going to grad school next year, that’s exciting! I love Computer Science. I'm having fun with friends. I ride my bike, even when it’s freezing.  Does that mean I’m healthy and in shape? You’re right. I have grand plans for the future and everything is fine. Still, I get written off all the time and I guess I’m not the only one. Personally, I just try to not let it get to me. Here’s why.<p>How I got written off: phase one<p>It all started when I was in my final year in high school. One day, my math teacher asked me what I wanted to study. I’ve always been pretty determined and told him the truth. <i>I’d like to study Computer Science in college, sir. Go for a master’s degree.</i> He laughed at me, in my face. Point blank. I studied economics and languages back then, and I admit, the math I was taught was pretty poor. A few weeks after, he did the same to my mom on parents’ evening. It’s this sort of event where parents go to and get an evaluation of their kid. <i>Your son will be lucky enough if he gets a bachelor’s degree and eventually graduates.</i> It didn’t matter much to me. I would go to college and get this damn master’s degree. I couldn’t and wouldn’t give in now. And here I am, my CS degree almost in reach.<p>How I got written off: phase two<p>My first year in college was all right. However, I had some problems with calculus. I (still) had to learn how to derive a function and calculate surfaces, while the other guys in my class were pretty much all ready for some advanced differential equations. <i>Damn it, I should’ve taken more summer classes.</i> That’s what I thought back then. Would that have helped? I don’t know. Eventually, I passed the course by studying day and night. Bottom line is, I got through and my grades weren’t even that bad. That’s great!<p>Three years later, I met a friend from elementary school on my weekly train. He was going nuts over cycling and I recently bought a bike too. That’s when I decided I wanted to get in shape again. I hadn’t been practicing sports for three years. That’s a long time. Too long to keep you physically and mentally healthy. Basically, he became my trainer and mentor for the coming months. I stopped eating fried food, limited my meat consumption and ate a lot of pasta (gotta love carbohydrates! ;-)). <i>Hahahahaha, you’re cycling now, are you? And you’ve stopped eating fast food? You goof! You won’t carry on, I tell ya!</i> That’s what many of my dorm “friends” said. I’m in my second year of cycling now and I love it. Still going. And I will be going harder and faster. Mens sana in corpore sano.<p>How I’m getting written off: leaving college<p>So… it’s almost time for me to leave college now and I have a clear plan. I want to start a startup. Actually, I am starting a startup. We’ve been working on it for two to three months now (not only coding), and it’s going pretty well. It’s got to do something with photo sharing. I know what a lot of you will be thinking now. <i>Another Instagram clone? Another PicPlz? I already share my photos and I don’t need another service!</i> That would sound a lot like my math teacher in twelfth grade. But that’s ok I guess. My dorm “friends” are reacting likewise. They think going to the USA to pursue your dreams and start a startup is ridiculous. Maybe it is? I don’t think so. Let them have their way. I’ll have mine.<p>What exactly am I getting at now? It’s pretty simple. Believe in yourself, because no one else will. People tend to believe only in the successful. A lot of us have a strong belief in top CEO’s and other successful guys. Take Steve Jobs as an example. He’s seen a lot of resistance from Apple around 1985, but he kept going. At the end of 1997, he finally got it right. He’s got his own child back. And see how it has grown over the years.<p>If you never believe in yourself, you’ll never get somewhere. I haven’t got a lot of life experience, but I’ve seen some pretty insecure boys and girls in my time at college. Stand up for yourself and you’ll be able to change lives. Did you ever notice how nothing or no one ever changes in your town? Nothing ever changes. Everyone goes to the same church or the same job, the same restaurants, the same swimming pool and everybody goes to the same basketball game every weekend. It’s like this huge fish tank we’re all stuck in and you can’t find a way out. Well, I may be kind of stuck. And I think the perfect way to be unstuck is by pursuing your dreams and by doing things you like. Pursue your dreams. Start your own startup. Create something. Yes, some of us may fail. Yes, you probably won’t be the next Zuckerberg. Failing is all right, as long as it’s <i>constructive failing</i>. Don’t listen to what others have to say all the time, because it will hunt you down. Do what you think is right. Just have no regrets and create some memories.<p>- The thoughts of a 22-year old with no life experience.",1300373211

The reason its not flash is because front end developers, hate flash with a passion that borders, frothing at the mouth psychosis. They hate flash because very simply it takes work off of their desk. At the end of the day, a client still won't want to pay twice as much for something that works on half of modern browsers when in reality his high school kid could have done it in 10 minutes with flash, (unless its for mobile). Its the same stupid argument I've heard for the past 10 years, but the difference today is mobile platforms won't support flash (or it just sucks on mobile) and there is finally an opportunity to kill flash. That pretty much sums it up. Haters will hate, client will still pay for flash, flash sucks on mobile, lame slide shows are not innovative.",1300373107

Because we know, and the universe knows that nothing was taken away from them.  The restrictions are entirely artifical and designed to do nothing except create an enormous inequality between the the ""owner"" of the information, and everyone else.  That's the sole purpose.  These Imaginary Stuff owners then use this disparity (a legal fiction entirely) to generate massive wealth based on entirely contrived circumstances.<p>Since the dawn of speech nothing like this has existed because it never made sense.  Anything one person said could be repeated by anyone who could remembered it. So when did information suddenly become ownable?  It's a nonsensical legal fiction of epic proportions.<p>I contend that if the information is publicly available, you no longer own it. This is how the universe operates. Fans of Imaginary Stuff rights will not be able to get their way for long. Or rather, they shouldn't be allowed to use the legal system to enforce their artificial disparity.  If you want to own information, keep it a secret.  Otherwise, it's everyone's.<p>Another way of looking at it is, if you want to get paid for good information/content/art production, you're going to have to do what every other human does, continue working even after producing great works.  You should be valued for your talent, and ability to produce from it over and over - just like everyone else.  A bricklayer doesn't lay one brick really well and then charge everyone to use it daily. The value should be placed on the ability, not the product, since there's no physical product at all really.  The slight exception being physical works of art etc, but then they're not just information, so the rules I'm talking about do not entirely apply.  Photographic reproductions are information, but an original work in physical form is still valuable for being the first and physical.<p>What do you other smart folks think about this?  I know a lot of us work in information production in some form. I myself am a software engineer, so I'm not just trying to take from everyone else and pretend the rule doesn't apply to me because I'm not an information/content producer. I actually am.

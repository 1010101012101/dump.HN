So it's not like I copied your app. (I actually started mine first. I've been doing it slowly over the last several months.) \nNeither of us seems to have plans of monetization, so it shouldn't be a big deal.",1229878764
405492,comment,405412,405412,0,0,mdasen,,,"The question really is how to stop it.<p>It seems (to me) that any attempt to stop it would require two economic prerequisites: a value of labor high enough to support a living wage and economic apparatus that made employment gainable through a regular mechanism (like a corporation).  To clarify the first point, by living wage I mean a wage that someone can live independently on, not some notion of cable TV and a Honda for all.  The second point is that employment must be available in a way that normal people can find and attain it.  For example, in the US I can look through want ads, interview with a corporation, and while it might be hard in a down economy it is possible to attain.<p>If the value of labor is such that it doesn't produce the value needed to gain a living wage, slavery becomes too easy.  People won't fight it enough because they don't have another option.  If a government is so corrupt and unstable, even subsistence farming can be unworkable.  Likewise, depending on the land and water, subsistence farming can be unworkable.  In the US, the value of labor is very high for various reasons: stable government, lots of capital goods for labor to use, good education, etc.  In some places, the value of labor can be so depressed by factors like those that it becomes difficult to get an independent living.  For example, if you try farming and corruption abounds, you might have your food stolen by thugs to the point that you're starving.  Labor becomes something you can't subside on.<p>Likewise, in many places, corporations don't want to do business.  There are plenty of places that aren't up to the standard of the US or Europe that nonetheless are stable enough to reasonably do business in.  For example, Egypt has a pretty high corruption level, but you don't expect street thugs to dominate the economy.  You can't do business in some areas unless you're willing to be a corporate quasi-governmental organization and that costs a huge amount of money.  In fact, corruption really becomes a scale and as corruption rises, the value of labor drops because a lot of the value that labor produces goes into buying protection and paying bribes.<p>Of course, attaining both of those are hard things to do.  I'm hesitant to suggest any course because I don't know that one has ever been successful.  As much as we complain (wherever we are in our computer connected world) about the crap we have to deal with, we're very lucky.",1229878762

405488,comment,404760,405137,0,0,apinstein,,,"First of all, I would argue that $2000 is not <i>irreversibly devastating</i>. One could pay it back over a couple of years. Secondly, as another poster said, one should be contributing to an HSA, <i>saving in anticipation</i> of such an expense. Thus in all but the rarest of cases most of the money should be already available in such a situation.<p>I do agree that fighting insurance companies is a problem. Perhaps the government should require insurance companies to electronically code their policies so that you can get instant pre-approval for medical care on site, with steep fines to insurance companies for reneging on payment for pre-approved procedures.<p>As a society, we need to do everything we can to reduce the transaction costs of accessing health care. I'll bet that 15-20% or more of health costs are administrative, which is ridiculous.<p>Finally, many HSA plans realize that preventive care is important and provide ""first dollar"" coverage for preventive care, meaning the plan pays for it, not you (via your HSA account).

405487,comment,404581,404581,0,0,snorkel,,,"Why is anyone who doubts the overall integrity of then investment industry is getting downmodded here? The HN crowd is usually smarter than this. First of all, downmods are for spam so stop treating this board like diggiotic censorbots. Second of all, educate yourselves about the truth of the investment industry. Or better yet try trusting your own money with it and learn the hard way. Big brokerages buy large blocks of a stock which sends the price up, then they call affiliated brokerages to advise all of their clients to buy the same stock because the price is going up which sends the price up more, then the big brokerage dumps their shares and keeps the profit. Pump and dump. It's one of the many price manipulation games the finance services industry plays against its own clients, it's illegal, and it happens every trading day in full view of the SEC. Madoff proved the SEC are the Keystone Cops. Suckers believe that brokers are paid according to the success of the client's profile because that's what their brokers tell them. Dead wrong. Brokers are paid according to the number of sales, transactions, and new clients (suckers) they can reel in. So go ahead and downmod me. There's one born every minute. Always more sheep to be shorn.",1229878165

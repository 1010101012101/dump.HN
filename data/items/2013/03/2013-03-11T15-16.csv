He has stated limits to what he will authorize.  However if we accept that he can authorize it without having laid out limits to his authority, what stops another president from authorizing more?<p>Bear in mind, one of the most common ways for a democracy to become a dictatorship is for there to be broad emergency powers granted to the president - and then for the president to declare what effectively becomes a permanent state of emergency.  Lest this seem paranoid, remember that the American experiment is 237 years old.  If we assume that we are in a random point in time in the history of the USA, there is an a priori over a 10% chance that the USA will no longer exist in 24 years.  There is a similar chance that the USA will survive another 2370 years.  When we look across how long different types of government have lasted in different countries, the prospect of our system of government ending inside of 24 years is much more likely than its lasting 2370 years.<p>Does that seem absurd?

Are surgical tools getting contaminated after sterilization but before the surgery?<p>Maybe hospitals should be turned into high-class[1] (lower-effectiveness) cleanrooms.  I realize laminar flow in such a chaotic environment is impossible, and of limited effectiveness if people are not gowned and so shed contamination all the time, but there could at least be an attempt to push some of the contamination to vents on the floor.  How much would that increase costs?  It wouldn't have to be entire hospitals, only the recovery wards.<p>Other than that, a major initiative to clean up hospitals could be undertaken.  Surfaces and floors and everything else commonly touched should be sterilized more often, to start with.  Any area that sees a lot of patient turn-over is going to be heavily contaminated.  Anyone who goes from room to room (doctors, nurses) should wear gloves before entering a room to avoid cross-contamination.

If I work in a tall office building, wouldn't the app see a change in barometric pressure when I go up the elevator? Is this small enough that it doesn't matter, or do you handle it in some way?<p>These are excellent questions. The data is extremely noisy due to exactly the reasons you suggest. At near-sea-level, an 8 meter altitude change results in a 1mbar change. So the effect is very significant and causes noise. There are some simple methods to weed out the noise: some changes are obviously too fast to be meteorological in nature, so those can be discarded.<p>Cumulonimbus itself is not working to solve this problem right now, but Cliff Mass and his lab are. We've livestreaming our data to them and they are currently working on quality control algorithms. They are starting by looking for phones that aren't moving, using the GPS and accuracy information. From there they will work on assimilation and then begin forecasting.<p>Quality control and altitude correction is indeed important for our data to be properly used in meteorological systems, but currently we're seeing a simpler way to do quick analysis. The density of the network is getting pretty good in cities (though we're seriously lacking in more rural areas and we'll have to pick that up), which means that single data-point altitude changes are very obvious compared to the rest of the nearby points.",1363015733

Insulin prevents your body from breaking down it's natural stores of energy.  When you eat anything with a high glycemic index (Which is most food in the American diet) you have an insulin reaction.  While having an insulin reaction, you don't burn fat stores.  If you can't burn your fat stores, you don't lose weight.

I don't know, Lucretius would probably say yes. But you cannot deny its existence since we are speaking of it, so it must be part of this world. Then again, are there things which are part of this world but not natural? I have no freaking clue man.

Moving to a city to be homeless seems like a terrible idea regardless of context - but sacrificing some financial flexibility for your preferred lifestyle (so long as you're not broke) seems sane.<p>You're discounting, once again, the point of connectedness. The senior folks you talk about - how long have they been there? Are all of their friends there? What would they do with themselves if they moved into the countryside - visit friends they don't have?<p>The connectedness of cities goes beyond business. There is a reason why major urban centers are a focal point for subcultures - the more fringe they are the more urban they get. It's the only place where these groups are able to sustain a critical mass to keep existing. For a great many people cities are the only place where they can be themselves.",1363014096

Their browser is dominant, with 70% usage share, allowing them to determine which network extensions will catch on. They are pursuing a multi-platform strategy where they move the key API into the client to commoditize the underlying operating system. They have attracted a number of public network operators to use their platform to offer information and directory services. We have to match and beat their offerings including working with MCI, newspapers, and other who are considering their products.""</i><p><a href=""http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/internet-tidal-wave.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lettersofnote.com/2011/07/internet-tidal-wave.htm...</a><p>He seems to view it as a most serious threat.

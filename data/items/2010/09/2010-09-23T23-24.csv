But I think it’s “liquidity preference” that totally breaks the investor valuation.<p>As a toy example, imagine a company that could be worth $3, $30, or $300 each with equal probability. The logical valuation of this company is $111. A risk tolerant investor would pay $11.1 for 10% of the company.<p>Now imagine you have a 3x liquidation preference. If the company liquidates for less than 3 times your investment, then you get it all and the suckers holding common stock get nothing. How much will you pay for 10% of the company in this situation?<p>Well, if the company exits at $3 or $30 then you’ll get all of it, and if it exits at $300 then you get $30. The total expected value is ($3 + $30 + $30)/3 = $21. That’s almost twice what you’d pay if didn’t have liquidity preference! Even though, with 3x liquidity preference, you’d pay $21 for 10% of the company, $210 is clearly a nonsense valuation for the company as a whole.",1285285554

Travis worked in ""marine salvage"", recovering lost or stolen property for a commission.  His life plan was to take his retirement in small batches, as his life went along.  Rather than waiting till later to take it all at once.  Kind of an odd set of ideas about what is important in life.<p>Prior to going full time (such as it is) for BCC, Patrick worked at a big freaking enterprise working sixty hours each week.  Often more.  He built BCC on five hours per week.<p>So now his life has improved in measurable ways, and looks to keep on improving.<p>The thing that might be easy to miss about Patrick is that he is very intentional.  You might call it goal-directed.  Disciplined.  I think it might be fair to say that he knows what direction to take his life in, what will make him happy.<p>And one thing that he is unlikely to do is to confuse what works for him and what others think should work for him.<p>It took me quite a few years (more than Patrick has so far) that being smart is not all it cracked up to be.  Being smart works when it brings you wealth.<p>There is a common confusion that money and wealth are essentially the same thing.  To my way of thinking, wealth includes to work on what you enjoy or love, to have choices how you spend your time, not having to agonize about having a roof over your head, to have family and friends to cherish and that cherish you, to have the respect of peers.  It would appear to me that Patrick is on the road to wealth.<p>The fact that Patrick's version of success doesn't seem to include feverish addictions to money and fame has apparently made the author of this blog post ""violently ill"".<p>Were I to look to choose an example of how to live, I would be more likely to recommend Patrick, and I would recommend that the author of the blog post take a second look at his take on this topic.",1285285420

Colleges realized they were selling too cheaply when students could pay off tuition by working summers. They can't stop increasing the price because a competitor that kept increasing prices would use the extra money to become a better college than they were.<p>3. Because of 1 and 2, more parents and relatives became willing to help pay for college.<p>4. For people without parents or relatives that wanted to help, loans were the only way.<p>Since it would be too ""socialist"" to directly reduce the cost of college, the government decides to hand off the subsidies to for-profit entities that have become an $85 billion industry in a program called FFEL. Instead of reducing or reigning in the costs of college, they do what any sane business does: increase profits at the expense of someone else (students). They form partnerships with colleges to get kickbacks for every student loan.<p>And when all of you (including H-1B exploiters like Google and Microsoft) complain that the US is falling behind in education, more taxpayer money gets siphoned off into these corporations when a politician decides to get reelected again by keeping these programs in place.<p><a href=""http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&backgroundid=00170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.vi...</a>",1285284635

1721966,comment,1720948,1721901,0,0,photon_off,,,"I hate to say it, but while historious might be pretty awesome, you have a lot of factors working against you.<p>First, there are things that already do this, and they work well enough.  My browser address bar (FF3) finds 95% of stuff that I'm looking for.  The other 5% I can open up my history and search.  And, if that fails, I can retrace my steps somehow (re-searching Google, etc).  I don't find it to be a big deal.<p>Second, Historious has a pretty large barrier-to-entry, and the pain-point may not be strong enough to overcome that.  By barrier to entry, I'm referring to the effect of users finding it very difficult to switch the way they do things.  I'm sure this is well documented, and there's a name for it, but if a user has their own way of doing things it will take additional value over just the new process being better, because there is a cost to the actual switching itself.  By routinizing a process, it actually <i>feels</i> easier (even though it may be much more difficult than other methods).  Since finding things you've previously browsed probably happens a lot, people probably have their own way of dealing with this.  I'll just search again, or look through my browser history.<p>Third, it makes me think.  I don't want to constantly evaluate whether or not I should historify a site; which is necessary since it'd be ridiculous to historify every site I come across.<p>It's hard to gain a fresh perspective on something you've worked so much on.  Believe me, I know.  I've been working on an the most incredible bookmarklet (guaranteed).  I use it all the time, and I love it.  But I've been routinized, and that's one of hugest problems. Even though it solves some pretty annoying problems and is awesome, I've found that people who try it out will not connect the fact that it solves problem XYZ, and they have problem XYZ, so they should use it.  If they already have a solution to XYZ, that comes up to the top of their mind's list of how to solve the problem.",1285284053

I am not saying the article is the best possible article or was free from cringe inducing statements. But I also don't see it as something someone should be banned for, not even remotely close. It sounded more like the guy writing it was Catholic himself, overcame Catholic guilt (which is a topic people do discuss), and was speculating through projection that Patrick is Irish and suffers from it. It seemed like a huge long shot though. Myself I think it's more likely Patrick is like me and is perfectly aware he can make more money working for some corporation in some contexts, but chooses to do his own thing instead even though his current income is possibly less than he made working for the man. And that's me projecting as well. Someone who seeks to be able to live on the beach on Thailand might write an article saying that Patrick must be running his business with the goal of moving to Thailand. Someone bent on taking over the world, creating one world government and declaring himself emperor of the galaxy might write an article saying that Patrick is planning to build a fleet of spaceships. OK, that last one is silly, forget that example.<p>Patrick also has only been a year from quitting his job, so it's not a weird thing to be making less than a hundred million a year or whatever people are unreasonably assuming he should be making. What he is making is pretty darn awesome for a one man shop that's only been around a few years.<p>Personally I think that whatever he is making in total and his reasons for being satisfied and fulfilled doing so are his own business and I don't give his personal lifestyle choices any thought myself. But even it being his own personal choice, someone writing about that, and in essence projecting their own issues onto this one like the original article did, is not something offensive or mean spirited. The first half of the article was practically a love letter to Patrick and quite flattering. The rest seems to be both giving advice, and the author working out his own personal shock that someone he saw as a mentor leading him to great wealth and fame was earning only a modest income. That doesn't mean though that Patrick's advice is bad, Patrick's articles are great and filled with useful information.",1285283784

Probably the most influential book of my entire CS degree, not too difficult once you get used to Scheme, and incredibly  rewarding (and fun!).<p>Your experience is mostly OO and procedural. Let's round it out with the functional cannon: In the first half of PLAI you <i>implement</i> the crown jewels of the paradigm: first-class functions, both with dynamic and static scope (aka closures), lazy evaluation ala Haskell, true language-supported continuations, recursion (the Y combinator is in there), mutable vs. immutable variables and more.<p>The implementation language is Scheme, which is really really easy to grasp the basics of quickly. So as a side effect you will learn an interesting esoteric language just as you wanted. I would think any competent programmer could learn enough Scheme to work through PLAI in under 2 days. Basic Scheme is kinda like ""lisp light"" compared to CL/Clojure, so it's a great way to start.",1285283394

It's not too late to join the train ride once it starts moving up.  The thing about real estate is that once it starts moving up, it's very difficult to stop.  There are too many factors to keep pushing it up.  Likewise, once it starts falling, it will keep falling for a long time.<p>Of course, that's only the investment aspect of it.

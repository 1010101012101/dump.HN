4146,comment,3670,3766,0,0,semigeek,,,"""But if you actually watch that ticker it's increasing so slowly that it probably isn't costing them any more money""<p>\nMultiply the increase by the amount of users that receive it and the number doesn't seem so small - and can never be considered 'no cost'.  The trade off is that with the more mail they can index per user, the more relevant advertisements they can display and the more people they can lure with their gimmick.  Of course, they're also taking advantage of the 10% rule when it comes to offering that large amount of storage.",1173891290

I seriously doubt you think there's no way to accomplish that.<p>Perhaps we are not talking about the same thing?  The tone of the article was that students were being turned away from CS as a major because they felt nothing new was happening.  In response to that I'm talking more about applications of these technologies.  The applications of parallel processing haven't even begun to be tapped out.  Same with the applications of speech processing.  <p>I once used gp to create a soccer bot for the robocup.  It took hours to train it to even kick the ball on my iMac running Mandrake.  With more advanced use of parallel processing I could have trained a much more sophisticated bot -- but that was not available to me at the time.<p>\nAs for the theory of computation, perhaps that field is completely tapped out.  I have no idea -- you would probably know better than I.<p>Perhaps you're right.  Maybe all the programs have been written (theoretically).  Perhaps there's nothing left to be done. <p>Then again, computer science has only been around since the mid 20th century.  Chemistry and physics have been around much much longer.  It just seems that it's a bit too early to call.",1173890385

We all talk about Web 2.0 not being a bubble but maybe that's just because the 'average joe' doesn't know anything about what's going on. Other than a few stories about MySpace and YouTube most people never hear about any Internet startups. How do you cross that divide without spending alot of money on TV commercials? During the first bubble they were great at getting people's attention but bad at software, it seems like now things are exactly the opposite.",1173888418

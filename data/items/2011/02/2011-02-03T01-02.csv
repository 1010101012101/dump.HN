At least wikipedia's version [1] of the history of cars seems consistent with this, showing a history of dozens of engine designs and fuel choices (solids, liquids, gases, and electric batteries) long before the ICE came to dominate. (Maybe I'm unreasonably optimistic, but I'm unsurprised we've succeed in breaking free of our original ""path"", steam engines). Perhaps it's my lack of imagination, but I'm not aware of any practical fuel (chemical or otherwise) superior, in energy density and convenience, to liquid hydrocarbons. Nor am I aware that there was a historically superior way of obtaining liquid hydrocarbons to letting them gush out of the ground, which I understood was the least expensive source for them throughout modern history.<p>Am I simply rationalizing the history of modern transportation, and if so can you enlighten me as to the ""paths not taken"" that I'm blind to?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_automobile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_automobile</a>",1296698072

Saw a few events on facebook picking up speed (hundreds of thousands of attendees) so decided to leverage that instant-market<p>- Wasn't sure whether or not it would work, but I didn't have too much to lose ($8 url and a few hours) so I went for it and started hacking away<p>- Around 10am the project was launched, complete with a website, domain name, and orignal t-shirt design, all done by me<p>- 4 minutes later the first orders came in, thus paying for the domain name and becoming profitable (minus my time value)<p>- Since then the site has gone slightly viral, with several thousand hits, hundreds of ""likes"" and a bunch of tweets (not to mention t-shirt sales)<p>- Became the ""official t-shirt"" and event photo for the Snowpocalypse 2011 facebook event with 300,000 attendees.  That's a nice little market to advertise to, no?<p>This is really just a social + eCommerce experiment with a taste of vitality.  While I have designed t-shirts and sold them online before, I have never done anything quite like this, ie ""hopping on the bandwagon"" and riding out a live-fast-die-fast trend.  I have also never experimented with any sort of viral platforms.  I hope to implement some potentially viral features in my current startup/project, so I figured it would be worth it to test the waters with this mini-project.  It was indeed.

Thus, the real question is whether Bing should cripple its machine-learning algorithms if they infer (correctly) that Google-suggested results are likely to be relevant.<p>That is, if any learning system is observing click-stream behavior from users and mining it for relevance evidence, I'd expect it to ultimately home in on the true weight of each piece of evidence in that click-stream data. Since Google's contributions to that data are likely to be highly relevant, any good machine learning system is going to <i>learn</i> that they are relevant and start recommending them.<p>In effect, then, what Google is arguing is that if Bing's machine-learning algorithms are correctly inferring that results that happen to come from Google are highly relevant, Bing should blind itself to that knowledge.<p>I'm not sure that's good for anyone except Google.<p>(For a completely uninformed guess about why Google might be interested in raising copycat claims about Bing, I go out on a limb here: <a href=""http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2011/02/02/the-google-microsoft-squabble-over-bing-results-some-completely-uninformed-speculation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.moertel.com/articles/2011/02/02/the-google-micro...</a>)",1296697226

Use lasers to remotely energize (zap a heat exchanger on) lightweight craft carrying hydrogen.  The hydrogen wouldn't burn.  Instead, it would just act as a reaction mass of very low weight, thus producing very high exhaust velocities.  Basically, this would give you the exhaust velocity (read: fuel efficiency) of the upper theoretical end of nuclear rockets, but without the heavy nuclear equipment onboard, making the craft even lighter and more efficient.<p>But that's not even the clever bit.  The clever bit of Jordin's proposal is that the laser tracking/energizing system can be built <i>modularly</i>.  You can build one prototype module that can launch one toy craft.  Then you figure out how to mass produce it and build a whole bunch of these puppies that can lock onto and zap a much larger heat-exchanger carrying craft.<p>What you get is very cheap access to orbit <i>without</i> ungodly huge R&D and infrastructure costs up front.<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=modular+laser+launch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&#3...</a><p>(In this case ""ungodly huge"" = price of a space elevator.)",1296696570

Same with having a tight nit group of people.<p>With more people, the pro is that there is more activity. With this, you have an effective mechanical turk of some sort since there are so many people to get help from and one of those people can be very useful. The con is that conversations are overloaded, so many try to post one liners to achieve top listing status in a thread. This discourages those with better experience and insight to make a comment since they have to spend a long time on a comment only to have it buried and ignored. The other con is that only pop submissions or submissions that take the least amount of time to consume (r/pics) have the most upmods. Take Hacker News. I remember when it was like reading a programmer's mailing list. Now with so many people, the most we can relate to are tech gossip.<p>With less people conversations are more focused and detailed.

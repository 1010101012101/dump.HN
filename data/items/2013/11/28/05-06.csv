For example, Google says it&#x27;s okay that tracking-ids leak from regular browsing mode in to Incognito mode - just not the other way around.

6813258,comment,6807380,6812131,5,0,adamtj,,,"You are technically correct - the best kind of correct!  While I was being a bit loose with my language, I don&#x27;t think that changes the point.<p>So maybe it&#x27;s not an assembly language or a bytecode, but that&#x27;s a pretty unimportant distinction.  Those are all intermediate representations (IR).  A good browser will JIT your asm.js IR to machine code in much the same way that a good JVM will JIT your bytecode.  An old browser will interpret it more slowly, but it will still work.<p>Asm.js may be crappy at the moment, but it will get better.  It&#x27;s an easily JITtable IR for the web that&#x27;s already supported in all browsers, even the old ones.  And the security is basically free since that&#x27;s already being paid for.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bloated text encoding, but gzip is pretty effective.  No, it doesn&#x27;t have great compiler support yet, but Emscripten and equivalent will no doubt have lots of useful headers and emulation and translation libraries very soon.  Asm.js is going to win for the same reason that Javascript won: everybody already has it.",1385618364

It&#x27;s a proof. It mostly works. There are problems. It sticks around for a bit, till someone else comes up with a better idea, implementation, etc, which takes hold. And then something else replaces that.<p>If you believe Bitcoin is Money 2.0, that it is destined to replace the USD, or other global currencies, you clearly accept that a newer, better thing is destined to replace an old flawed thing.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe in Bitcoin, you cannot deny that while IT might not be the thing to take down the USD, something else might.<p>So why does every article treat Bitcoin as a yes/no proposition? Either it is a moonshot success, or tulips? Either it changes the world and creates new millionaires, or it joins the pantheon of quick money schemes that tempted and fooled so many in the past?<p>I realize we&#x27;re talking technology here, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be binary.<p>Bitcoin, the software, solved a few problems thought unsolvable. It showed that you can decentralize the ledger, with some amount of stability. It showed you can solve the double-spend problem, and create some guarantee of transactional consistency.<p>But bitcoin has a few obvious issues. It is illiquid, and deflationary. It is slow (unless you just pretend its fast and hope for the best). It is only basically anonymous, though not foolproof. It is easy to steal, and easy to destroy.<p>Some of these problems are solvable, and some are inherent to BTC itself and cannot be removed from BTC.<p>But that&#x27;s not to say something can&#x27;t come along with all the good properties of BTC and fewer of the bad.

A book called “Being or Nothingness” by “Joe K” was mysteriously mailed to academics all over the world a few years ago, and I&#x27;m not sure anyone ever figured out why. In it, there were references to Hofstadter and other thinkers.

They might for goodwill, but they have no obligation to.<p>Yes, there is certainly a danger in the proverbial grandma flashing her phone (why do we always pick on grandma&#x27;s?

And then you said to me, &quot;Gee, how do I do that? I&#x27;ve never popped a bonnet open&quot;.<p>My next thought would probably be, &quot;Err, are you <i>really</i> sure you want to flash your car&#x27;s ECU?&quot;.<p>Cheers,\nVictor",1385615616

A more comparably priced 32GB flash drive stores several times less data (which might matter to you) and may have write speed that can&#x27;t even saturate USB2 (ditto; I installed Fedora on a 16GB flash drive that has max 3MB/s write speed and it takes amusingly long to install updates, though its read speed is decent and doesn&#x27;t suffer seek time).<p>Flash drives will get cheaper, but the meaning of &quot;5 years ago&quot; will change just as quickly (given current trends).",1385615287

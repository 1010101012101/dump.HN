Also, there are no type hints in the Clojure code. Without type hints it would be expected to run significantly slower. It's still an interesting comparison because you would generally only use type hints in performance bottlenecks.

If I'm in Germany and search for fast food, I want to see the results in English (if possible) but they should be about German businesses.<p>It's impossible to get it right though because you need to decide what the user wants to see localised vs always in their home locale. Maybe another header that you could set per site like ""Accept-Content-Locale"" or something.<p>And of course, both the Accept-Language and GeoIP methods fail miserably at determining things like the user's time zone.

I have a car from 1961 and one of the pieces I've had trouble replacing is the king pin (i.e. the pin that the front tires rotate around on a rear wheel drive car). It wasn't designed strong enough so it breaks commonly. They are not made anymore and it is difficult to replace. This technique wouldn't help me one bit because if cast steel didn't do it, then powdered steel sure isn't.<p>On the other hand the jewelery idea is probably a good one, strength properties don't matter too much.<p>You are right that it is all about the situation, but I see too many people that think 3D printing is somehow going to revolutionize the manufacture of physical things, its not.

Rule 2 - Add Components into that context
Rule 3 - Configure those Components in that context
Rule 4 - Link those Components in that context<p>If i create a assembly framework which understand the above 4 simple rules, i should be able to assemble components into applications thereby separating assembly from coding.<p>Assembling components implicitly gives meaning (domain) functionality to an application where the components may be generic or specific and can be rewired to give different meaning.<p>The edge cases will be that the components are very specific for a very narrow functional area which is like a single large component. Even in these case, no component is standalone and can provide all the functionality, even specific components will need to link to generic components to provide all the desired funtionality.<p>To prove to myself this is possible is why I created my website www.arshu.com using an assembled approach.

I agree that there is a real problem that needs attention.<p>But the delivery was awful! First he picks Iraq as an example to make a point that people of both political spectrums can understand -- not a good choice due to all the controversy of what's going on there. Fred the AQ operative from Libya blowing up a Shi'ite mosque is not really fighting for self-determination. Some are, no doubt. But picking this example really screws up the argument. It sounds like ""we won in Iraq so something really evil must come out of it!"",  kind of reasoning. Ugh.<p>Then we have the premise that robots can be used for counter-insurgency. While I agree that there are many pointy-headed folks at DoD who think this, it's not the way counter-insurgency works. The whole idea is to get real, live troops out into the field and interacting with the local population, protecting it. Protect the people first. Killer robots hosing down random houses with tear gas and tasers really don't meet that criteria.<p>At some point after the first few paragraphs, I pictured the author as waving their hands around in the air wildly and screaming ""The robots are coming! The robots are coming!"" Probably not fair to the author, but dude, you lost me. Calm down a bit and make a cogent point with supporting evidence. Tell a story.

You'd made your point and life is short.<p>""By globally respecting the right to self-defense recognized in America as the Second Amendment we can avoid an entire set of grossly negative and destructive futures.""<p>But the Second Amendment is titled ""The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"". It all kind of fits together as one huge compromise (the Bill of Rights) added on to the Constitution to get ratification. Other countries have already disarmed their populations and are very good at oppressing them and preventing change without robots. 
Even the U.S. took the ability of most people from owning combat firearms away in the 1930s as a way to prevent crime. As a world, we've already mostly lost our ability to enact forceful change. Those days are gone. You're late to the party, and while it's great this robot thing has woken you up, robots are just another tool in a very large toolbox that states use to keep the folks in line.<p>Finally, this is technology. It's not just the U.S., or DoD. This is the incredible, wonderful, terrible, and awful march of progress.

Our core product is built on a Java stack which has been under continuous development for over a decade now.  Some parts of it show its age.<p>We're pretty good at using our internal framework.  My colleagues are much better at it than I, since most of them have been working on it for ten years.  They estimated 1 ~ 2 man months to implement a particular internal app on the framework.  A man month from a senior engineer at my company (the estimator) costs us... hmm... well, I can't tell you, but $10,000 is a nice round number and it isn't very wrong.<p>I prototyped the internal app in 2 days in Rails, with one day wasted because I was also doing it as my first AppEngine app.  I estimate that 2 additional days would get it to substantially higher quality than the current internal app we have running.  My fully loaded cost is rather substantially less than $10,000 per month, so I probably could deliver the app for 10% of what it actually cost us.<p>I can't tell you what the internal app is, but suffice it to say that it is standard CRUD and delivers business value well in excess of either of the development costs.  It also uses very little enterprisey stuff.<p>I got permission for using a few days of company time on that project largely because I have a reputation for bringing certain projects in grossly under budget.  My solution is simple: cheat.  For example, I was given a stack of Perl code and told to provide documentation for it.  The code was well commented and consistently written, but we had NO overarching design docs.  (Provider X had subcontracted from Y who acquired Z who... it happens.  Enterprise!)  We were paid a large fixed bid for the documentation.  I wrote a Ruby program to spit it out, complete with graphs describing control flow and web pages with syntax highlighted Perl code.  That was approximately 5% my commentary and 95% the output of a Ruby programming which stitched together a one-off Perl parser (thank God for coders who were totally obsessive about their conventions) and an OSS graph producing library, plus Javascript SyntaxHighlighter and an OSS web template.  The customer was overjoyed, my bosses pocketed a truly absurd margin (they bid on the assumption I would do it all via sweat of my brow), and I did not have to spend several months of my life reading through hundreds of Perl files with comments written only in Japanese.<p>That said, while I'd love if we could abandon all of our existing Java code and do nothing but Rails development, we have waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much invested in our core products to do that.  So I nibble around the edges, collect wins where I can, and take stuff I learn from Rails projects and get them incorporated into our core product line.  (Example: I hooked the other member of the core team on Prototype, which is now the first and only Javascript library ever supported by our company, and customers who see screens with it incorporated are extraordinarily happy relative to their older, non-interactive screens.)",1249405670

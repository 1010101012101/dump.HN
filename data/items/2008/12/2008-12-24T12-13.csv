So if customers self-host it should be technologies they're comfortable supporting, which IMO rules out Ruby or Python frameworks since most of my targeted customers would likely be using .NET or Java.",1230122210

If they <i>really</i> dug down to think about what their greatest weakness was, they might find it was an issue of character.  And those don't go over well in an interview.<p>What company or government would hire someone who said their greatest weakness was sex addiction, alcoholism, sexism or a vindictive streak?  And yet, men such as Bill Clinton, Winston Churchill, Richard Feynman and Thomas Edison have done great work and great things despite those weaknesses.",1230120695

You should look at the political compass web site sometime to see how different the US politicians actually are.<p>Obama is going to be like any other US president: optionally do some good things, not change some things and make some things worse.  The biggest contribution he is likely to make is let us get back to not being embarrassed every time we see our president in the news (well, that and do something sensible about this infernal war).",1230120170

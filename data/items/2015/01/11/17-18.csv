8870605,comment,8870014,8870014,0,0,lmkg,,,"Professional Web Analyst here. My day job is working with metrics on web sites. I&#x27;ll try and weigh in.<p>First, we can argue and pontificate and philosophize all we want, but ultimately there is no proof of the pudding except the tasting. This is a falsifiable hypothesis. It can be tested, so it should be tested.<p>That said... I can see two potential issues with this metric.<p>1. It&#x27;s a ratio metric. Whenever you metric by taking two numbers and combining them into a single number (in this case, by division), you are losing information. You are saying that several very different scenarios are basically equivalent. You are saying that your current density of 25 story links in a 500KB app, is basically indistinguishable from 1 story link in a 20KB app, which is also the same as 500 story links in a 10MB app.<p>It also means that there are two ways to &quot;improving&quot; this metric. If you want to double the current density of 5% up to 10%, you have two options: One is trimming the fat from the app so it takes up half the space. The other is making your stories twice as long. Your metric will not distinguish between these two cases. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing. In particular, having stories twice as long has no impact whatsoever on the homepage.<p>2. It&#x27;s a &quot;means-to-an-end&quot; metric. If this metric is meaningful at all, it&#x27;s because of the relationship to content load times and how much extraneous junk is on your homepage. But... you can just measure load times and homepage click-through directly, and optimize for those. This provide additional value beyond what those metrics give you. If anything, it provides less value by over-focusing on just two things, which is only one part of content load time, and is only tangentially related to design bloat.<p>If you&#x27;ve already decided that content load times are unacceptable and you want to make them faster, this is a metric that you can look at and it will make an engineer say &quot;huh&quot; and give you an idea of how much room for improvement it is. You can use it as a benchmark, and compare to other apps to get an idea of whether your design can be streamlined. But setting this as a top-level metric and optimizing for it is just as likely to lead you astray as to have a meaningful impact. And if your content load time is already acceptable, I don&#x27;t see the value in what this brings.<p>tl;dr It has use as a secondary metric, if you&#x27;ve already decided to slim down your page, to compare against other sites and give an idea of how much you can improve. As a top-line stat, improving this metric does not have a strong connection to improving your app.",1420999054

8870572,comment,8869732,8869732,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"Nice to see more press on the Palo Alto Longevity Prize; the whole point of the exercise is to do what they are doing very loudly.<p>Establishing a research prize is a form of investment in progress only available in the philanthropic world. At the very high level it is easy to say that philanthropists pay people to work on specific tasks. This is simple enough for smaller amounts: transfer a few thousand dollars to a research group and you have bought a very small slice of the time and equipment needed to achieve any particular goal. When we start talking about much larger amounts of money, millions or tens of millions, then there are important secondary effects that occur when making such investments. In these amounts money has gravity, money makes people talk, and money changes behavior and expectations in a far larger demographic than just the recipients. This is well known, and thus investment activities, philanthropic and otherwise, become structured to best take advantage of this halo of effects. Most of the experience in doing this comes from the for-profit world: it doesn&#x27;t take too long spent following the venture capital industry to see that investment is a lot more complicated than choosing a target and writing a check, and this is exactly because there are many secondary effects of a large investment that can be structured and harvested if investors go about it in the right way.<p>I theorize that the reason why research prizes remain comparatively rare is that firstly they are an investment strategy restricted to philanthropy, and thus people with the money to burn have little direct experience, and secondly the whole point of the exercise is not in fact paying people to do things directly, but rather creating a situation in which near all of the benefit is realized through the secondary effects generated by the highly publicized existence of a large sum of money. A research prize works by being a sort of extended publicity drive and networking event conducted over a span of years, a beacon to draw attention to teams laboring in obscurity, attract new teams, and raise their odds of obtaining funding. Connections are made and newly invigorated initiatives run beneath the light of a large sum of prize money, but at the end of the day that money becomes more or less irrelevant. It wasn&#x27;t the important thing, it was merely the ignition point for a much greater blaze of investment and publicity. By the time a team wins, they are typically in a position to raise far more funding than the prize amount provides.<p>The ideal end result is that a field of science and technology is rejuvenated, taken from obscurity and thrust into the public eye, made attractive to investors, and numerous groups are given the attention and funding they need to carry on independently. This is how it worked for the Ansari X Prize for suborbital flight, and more quietly, for the Mprize for longevity science: in both cases the entire field changed as a result of the existence of the prize and the efforts of the prize organization to draw attention, change minds, and build new networks. But the award of money wasn&#x27;t the transformative act, and in fact that award didn&#x27;t really occur at all for the Mprize, but rather change was created through the sum of all of the surrounding effects.<p>So consider this: people who arrive at the state of being wealthy and wanting to change the world through philanthropy, often after decades of for-profit investment participation, don&#x27;t have much in the way of comparable experience to guide them in the establishment and operation of research prizes. Thus creation of a research prize falls low in the list of strategies under consideration by high net worth philanthropists. Few people do it, and so there are few examples from which others can learn. It is the standard vicious circle of development, in which steady, grinding bootstrapping is the only way to create change.<p>Why care? Because research prizes work well. They work exceedingly well. Depending on how you care to plug numbers into equations, a well-run prize of $10 million will generate $150 to $500 million in investment in an industry, and that is just the easily measured result. Just as important is the following change and growth enabled by that initial burst of attention and funding. The Ansari X Prize spawned a number of other prizes in various industries, but I think it remains the case that medicine and biotechnology is poorly served in this respect. Outside of the efforts of the X Prize Foundation, the New Organ prizes, and other independent efforts such as the Palo Alto Longevity Prize, there is little going on. Given the proven utility of prizes there should be many more of them, and yet there are not.",1420998517

If people lived to be 1000 but their neural plasticity  was gone by 120, we would still have slavery, women would  not be able to vote and we would still be riding around in horse and buggy.

It still is a surprising that some vendors (I&#x27;m looking at you Bitdefender!) have obviously not even tried to fuzz their product. Koret&#x27;s presentation is already a year old, so I hope vendors would&#x27;ve now gotten at least some of their shit together. I wouldn&#x27;t bet too much money on it though, as it still has virtually no effect on how much the product will be sold. Take a guess many people will still give money to Bitdefender because they have had a really good review performances.<p>There&#x27;s definitely a pattern that AV companies put their efforts in being able to say they&#x27;re #1 in outside tests or in reviews. In ye olden times someone would just take multiple vendors, scan against 1000000 old viruses and rank them based on the detection %, and as the end result the &quot;best&quot; (and the most sold) products ended up being resource hogs. Later reviewers took notice and started also measuring file copying performance and detection capabilities against active malware, and in a year or two many vendors adapted and improved their performance and their efforts against malware that actually is being spread.<p>Hopefully reviewers will take notice and include some exploitability metrics in the future so that vendors need to focus on it or go out of business.<p>Funny thing is that despite Bitdefender having thousands of exploitable points in their product, at the moment your average user will still be less vulnerable against online criminals than most those who don&#x27;t run anything.",1420996385

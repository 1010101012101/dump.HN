I know several of them (who work for the 2nd largest paper in the world no-less) who can barely operate Word much less set up a Wordpress account.<p>Other than that I'd agree with you.  It is Journalist's job to do the actual reinventing and they're no where close now.  I just don't think they're capable enough to take the current generation of tools and build what they need to do it.  Essentially they need ""web journalism for dummies"" and it needs to be 10 times easier to use than Wordpress.",1250492188

Yes in many cases a good co-founder will help your company succeed.. but in many other cases a bad co-founder will most certainly help it fail.<p>If you haven't already identified one then you can forget about it. The question is moot. You don't want one anyway. That's obvious. What you want is someone who will work for you at a discount, a coder who likes the product and the tech you're using and likes to get his/her hands dirty. A lot of people are just happy to have good work and some input into what they think will be a good product.. that would free you up to focus more on the marketing business side of things which is just as if not more important than that product itself.",1250491820

Musicians used to be huge cultural phenomena, and a kind of escape into another world, now there are tons of similar escapes (computer games, for example, a huge thing, weren&#x27;t even available to the common how when pop was huge, nor where social media, chat, YouTube, Instagram, the modern &quot;artistically relevant and high production quality&quot; tv series and tons of other things). Now you can ask 10 people and they wouldn&#x27;t know a current top 10 song -- whereas in the 70&#x27;s for example it would be inescapable.<p>And graphic design has faded too -- there was a brief period in the mid-eighties to early 00s were graphic designers were huge pop heroes -- interviews in magazines, stars like Neville Brody, David Carson that you get to hear about even as a layman, etc. Now it&#x27;s only other graphic and web folk care about graphic and web designers.<p>><i>People change, and the culture changes.</i><p>It&#x27;s also good however to be making judgement calls on those changes too. Else we accept everything and anything as fate.",1450522647

They both have serialization and RPC approaches. They both have an IDL format and a compiler for codegen in static languages like C++ and Java.<p>Thrift was adopted by the Apache O/SS community and so it can be found in some Apache  projects, e.g. Thrift is used as an interop format in Apache Storm and as a serialization backend supported by Apache Parquet.<p>Thrift has had a lot of client libraries for different languages come out over the years, so it tends to work everywhere.<p>IIRC, CapNProto and FlatBuffers were each built as fresh takes on protobuf. So I imagine they are similar, with IDLs and serialization approaches of their own. I took a quick look at CapNProto&#x27;s Python module documentation and it looks very similar to thriftpy in philosophy, but I don&#x27;t know its intricate details as I haven&#x27;t used it.<p>This guide to Thrift covers all the important details of its schema approach and is meant as a cross-language guide.

The system didn&#x27;t start off as a full implementation of the game but just as a tool for making it a little bit easier to manually moderate a play-by-email/play-by-forum games, and the publisher was clearly implicitly ok with (in fact one of the first uses of the tool was for an exhibition match of sorts with one of the designers of the game). Once it became clear that this had slowly morphed into a full implementation of the game, I asked for formal permission and exactly where the limits were (e.g. on the graphics). So there was a bit more &quot;asking for forgiveness rather than permission&quot; involved than I&#x27;m really comfortable with. In general you should always ask up front.<p>This area is a bit of an interesting balancing act for the publishers of hobby board games. On one hand it&#x27;s almost certain that a free online implementation gives the game a lot more longevity and thus drives long-term sales. It means the game continues to be played a lot more by the existing players, which means they continue discussing it. This in turn attracts new players to the game, and sells more physical copies. It also means that people are excited for any new expansions, since they&#x27;ve played the base game enough to want the variety.<p>On the other hand free online implementations do probably make it harder to license the game for a commercial digital implementation. For example tablet implementations of board games looked like a big deal a few years ago. But my feeling is that it didn&#x27;t actually turn out to be a viable business in the long run. Making the tablet implementations is just too expensive and outside of a handful of games with massive pre-existing mass market appeal (talking of the Carcassonne / Ticket to Ride tier of games) the sales just aren&#x27;t there.",1450522346

Art is not about &quot;mimicking&quot; the real world, neither should every artist speak with the same voice - far from it!<p>However, an artist that only talks about his own personal experience will not make art that anybody else wants to see. There has to be some sort of connection to the lives of other people around him, otherwise his art is meaningless to all but himself. And meaningless art is a contradiction in terms.<p>Art should be an interpretation of the real world that its audience can somehow relate to. Artists aren&#x27;t all that special as people, but they can be special in that they can get other people to think about the world around them in a new way. Of course, all interpretations factor in the view point of the author/artist, and that&#x27;s OK - else we really would have a whole bunch of artists producing identical stuff, and who wants that? The important thing is that somehow, the audience has to be involved in the work of art.<p>And by the way: what&#x27;s so bad about some artists being better than others? Isn&#x27;t that the way it&#x27;s supposed to be? After all, nobody would claim all programmers are identical in skill, so why should all artists be?",1450522287

Given that women (and other genders too!) are allowed to use the Internet  in many countries [0] it is best to not gender pseudo-anonymous entities who have not explicitly signaled their gender or preferred pronouns. Unlike in Portuguese, Spanish, or whatever your native tongue may be, in English there are gender-neutral pronouns available. Two possible alternatives are singular <i>they</i> [1] or the Spivak pronoun  <i>e</i> [2]. Defaulting to masculine pronouns as you did creates an environment that is unwelcoming and hostile for some, so to foster a welcoming space for all you should default to gender-neutral language.

10763207,comment,10760665,10760665,0,0,randomsearch,,,"I&#x27;m a geek who has in recent years dabbled with visual art, film, and a little performance art. I have a close relative who&#x27;s an artist. I&#x27;ve built artworks with artists over the last few years, one of which is currently on &#x27;tour&#x27; overseas, and I&#x27;ve built my own artwork that has been shown alongside work I&#x27;ve built with others. Hence I have first-hand experience of the contemporary art world, but very little formal training as an artist, and hence an outsider&#x27;s view of the state of things.<p>I&#x27;ve always been into art and primarily I love modern art, that is 1890s-1970s art. To avoid confusion, it makes more sense to use &quot;contemporary art&quot; to refer to art made today, which a lot of posters seem to be referring to as &quot;modern art&quot;.<p>The art I&#x27;ve made with artists has been very political, and I&#x27;ve been very happy about that. One of the films I made this year was also very political. As part of my work, I&#x27;ve been privileged to spend time in artists&#x27; studios and go to a lot of contemporary exhibition openings.<p>Coming away from this, my conclusions have been that (a) the artists I&#x27;ve been working with are exceptional, in that they <i>are</i> engaging with society, but (b) most of the art I see is made for artists, that can&#x27;t be understood or appreciated fully without a length explanation of how it relates to some previous work, or some theme in art. It rarely says something deeper or philosophical about society or our lives. For example, I may walk into a small exhibition space and find a few wooden blocks displayed on the floor. Or a piece of twine spread around a room. I ask my artist friends to explain it, and there&#x27;s no clear consensus or understanding. I think describing this as &quot;Art Becoming Irrelevant&quot; is a very kind way of putting it. I would describe it as &quot;art for artists&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s been a bugbear of mine for a while that in a world with so many pressing problems, where democracy is failing us, that artists have a huge responsibility to stand up and do something about it, rather than walking away from the mess and building more abstract installations.<p>One final point is that many posters are describing video games as &quot;art&quot;. Whilst I think video games _can_ be art, there is a very big difference between &quot;art&quot; and &quot;something that looks nice&quot; or &quot;something beautiful&quot; or &quot;something enjoyable&quot;. Art is defined by intention, amongst other things.

Wanting a globally unified and more efficient patent system is not, in fact, at all the same thing as wanting patents to cover more things. No one benefits from having patents take years between application and grant, for instance. No one benefits -- at least, not in ways any reasonable person could approve of -- from having lots of crappy patents pass examination.

802153,comment,802088,802128,0,0,gjm11,,,"Ow ow ow. No.<p>The usual reason for disagreeing with what you just said is that for most people the utility gain from (say) a 1/6000 probability of getting $3000 is <i>less</i>, not more, than the utility loss of certainly spending $1, and it only seems otherwise because we tend to round small utility differences to 0 mentally. I think this is correct. But here's another reason why you're wrong.<p>First of all, let me correct something in the previous paragraph. Of course hardly anyone plays the lottery just once, so let's consider playing 10 times per month in a lottery whose tickets cost $1 and whose only prize is $3000, with probability 1/6000. (Oversimplification, of course; I'm going with basically the figures you mentioned, and a fairly typical 50% take for the people running the lottery). So, if you do that for a year then roughly speaking you are paying $120 for a 1/50 chance of getting $3000.<p>So, suppose there's some person for whom the utilities really do work out the way you describe: getting $3000 with probability 1/50 is worth more than $120. And suppose that person could instead invest their money somewhere reasonably safe and get a return of 1% per annum over (inflation plus their temporal discount rate). For simplicity of exposition, I shall ignore inflation and discounting in what follows, so that's just an annual return of 1%.<p>Then instead of spending $120 on the lottery over a year, they could invest ~ $119.40 over the same period, at the end of which they will have $120 which they can put into the lottery. Same result, less money spent.<p>So. Unless your temporal discount rate is higher than the best rate of interest over inflation that you can get, playing the lottery <i>now</i> cannot be your best option -- at least, not if your motivation is that you think the utility gain from having more money when you win is worth the utility loss from having less money because you spent it.<p>In less-crappy economic times than we've had recently, you can typically get a rate of return that's quite a bit better than inflation. In which case, unless your discount rate is really high, you should not play the lottery with the intention of increasing your net utility.<p>(Of course, if your discount rate is really high, it follows that you should never save anything: anything you would save you should spend immediately on things that give you immediate pleasure, or put into the lottery at once.)",1251973627

802132,comment,802088,802088,0,0,patio11,,,"If you (or anyone you know) support the lottery, I urge you to read this analysis of them.<p><a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1126.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/1126.html</a><p>It breaks down the effect of a lottery when analyzed as a tax.  It goes beyond ""tax on those who are poor at math"" or ""a tax you volunteer to pay"".  And it is very devastating.<p>Choice bits:<p><i>Lottery proponents argue that a tax is a mandatory or compulsory payment, and playing the lottery is voluntary, so lottery revenue cannot be a tax. But they're confusing the purchase of a product with the payment of the tax on the product. True, the purchase of a lottery ticket is voluntary, but the tax portion of the ticket price is not, just as a sales or excise tax is compulsory on a voluntary purchase of alcohol, clothing or books. The voluntary nature of the purchase does not make the tax any less of a tax. Using the lottery supportersâ rationale, weâd have to say that because the purchase of a book is voluntary, the sales tax on the book is not really a tax. Just try to buy a $20 book and hand the cashier a $20 bill, but refuse to pay the $1 sales tax and leave the store with book in hand. The only difference between the lottery tax and sales or excise taxes is that the lottery tax is built into the price of the ticket, rather than reported separately.</i><p>On wealth redistribution and tax burdens:<p><i>The only thing the Wisconsin lottery really accomplishes is a redistribution of some of the tax burden, shifting it from property owners to lottery players.</i><p>On regressive taxation:<p><i>The National Gambling Impact Study Commission determined that, during the time period studied, not only were lotteries regressive, but the poor spent more as a dollar amount.</i><p>How lotteries support education:<p><i>In 1995, after nearly twenty years of earmarking proceeds for education, the [Montana] state legislature began transferring revenue to the general fund instead. The president of the Montana Education Association stated that it was an 'illusion' that lottery funds significantly benefited public schools.</i>",1251972277

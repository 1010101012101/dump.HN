4232353,comment,4232104,4232104,37,0,Caerus,,,"> Amazon has long enjoyed an unbeatable price advantage over its physical rivals. When I buy a $1,000 laptop from Wal-Mart, the company is required to collect local sales tax from me, so I pay almost $1,100 at checkout.<p>This is such an over blown argument. Sure, Amazon is ~7% (where I live) cheaper than traditional stores due to sales tax. But that $1000 Wal-Mart laptop has a $900 sticker price on Amazon, and most non electronic items are 20-40% cheaper than in stores.<p>If laws change and I have to start paying sales tax on Amazon, it won't change a thing about my buying habits.<p>Edit: They also have an inventory many times larger than any brick and mortar store. Whenever I go shopping, I have to choose between the least crappy option Wal-Mart decides to stock. On Amazon, I get exactly the one I want.",1342054739

Sure, some of these could be salvaged into something playable on this console but I would think the difficulty would still need adjustment since people now have a proper gamepad rather than a touchscreen pad. Also I would doubt many of these games are particularly competitive with equivalent games for the XboX etc even with the controls fixed.<p>Historically having some impressive launch titles has been an important precursor to success for consoles. The combination of the release timescale combined with the lack of concrete information for developers means that it seems unlikely that such titles will appear in time.<p>In other words, whilst I personally love this idea, I have no idea how I would encourage less geeky friends to get one, saying ""you can play the games that you can already play on your mobile phone"" doesn't seem like it would cut it.",1342054475

The worst Craigslist could do here is inform the users (who own the content) that their listing is being shown on Site X and provide a link to the page where the user can file a takedown notice. I don't know about you, but I probably would be happy that the listing is getting more exposure on more sites. I think most users would.<p>Markets are natural monopolies. Liquidity begets liquidity. The breaking down of these silos is a great thing for price discovery and a better functioning market.

When I crashed my bike before I had my GP, I did have to wait at a Walk-In Center, for about an hour, and ditto for Minor Injuries where they sent me after an initial evaluation,  but that's equivalent to going to an emergency room in the states, because you can't just walk in to the nearest doctor there, you have to be ""in-network"".  Later, through my GP I was able to get several osteopath sessions, a shoulder ultrasound, and physical therapy all of which was very well administered with minimal wait times.

4232215,comment,4232087,4232087,24,0,forgotusername,,,"Feedback from someone that's previously (long before the devops scene exploded) looked at commercializing a system like this:<p>Your UI should integrate monitoring and control using an actually visual interface detached from any underlying model used for state collection or implementation of state changes (because this stuff changes constantly, regardless of how much myopic VC money is thrown at it). This means instead of talking about ""recipes"" and suchlike, you talk explicitly about the objects being managed: services, servers, racks, PDUs, switches, routers, coolers, links, and so on.<p>Make it visual, like actually beautifully visual. Let me specify a floor diagram that colours each rack according to the mean health of the machines it contains. Clicking the rack should show an exploded view of each machine coloured by the mean health of each service they contain, and those services' dependencies. Provide instantly selectable overlays showing different kinds of topological relations (application/network/power/trust/routing/OAM/TCP connection state(!)) existing within the view (complete with colouring).<p>I want a tool that lets me study a floor diagram and instantly notice a set of racks are down because they are in a row supplied by a single PDU. I want to correlate crashes visually due to cooling hotspots, preferably even by relative colouring due to temperature sensors in the machines. I want to batch shutdown a set of machines connected to the NFS share I just found 0day on.<p>I want a generic visualization of a service that displays a set of vital metrics (error count, load, cpu usage) and a set of generic actions (restart, stop). I want a simple editor that allows me to assemble widgets (""CPU load gauage"", ""requests/sec gauge"", ""dependency health indicator"") into some meaningful representation of a service using nothing but a mouse.<p>Don't bake any topology into it: make it useful for systems as small as 2 cores, or as large as having presence in every country. Racks aren't first class objects, they aren't containers, they're relations with some useful attributes. Don't bake implementation or buzz technologies into it: your codebase could be less than 10,000 lines JS+high level language backend.<p>Don't freeze out keyboard cowboys: there's no reason a highly visual UI need require a mouse. An idiom involving a handful of standard shortcuts (""object select"", ""object query"", ""object manipulate"", ""back"", ""bookmark"", ""assign shortcut"") are all that's needed. I imagined a system involving keys 0-9 being redefinable (think Command & Conquer, not Emacs) with a few letters preassigned (think Gmail/Google Reader)<p>I want a UI no less visually beautiful than Google's search globe ( <a href=""http://data-arts.appspot.com/globe-search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data-arts.appspot.com/globe-search</a> ) for monitoring the state of my service. I want to notice the bandwidth spike occurring on the dark side of the earth.<p>Prior to a system like this that can be assembled with a minimum of fuss, and can be integrated with existing data sources and systems (most medium sized companies already have an asset database, etc.), I'm not going to be impressed by some crappy Ruby on Rails jammed together with a bit of JS as a fancy editor for some DSL.<p>Give us something with wow factor, not just another bland excuse of crap offering zero benefits over a command line, that'll end up lying dead in a Github repo in a few years.<p>[Footnote: for anyone with cash interested in systems like these, feel free to get in touch. I can barely enunciate correctly when talking about this stuff, my vision for what devops should look like is so far removed from the current popular state that it pains me to pay it much attention]",1342052822

Subscribers didn't like the price hike or the inconvenience of split companies and separate movie lists, etc.  The change was walked back, but netflix lost roughly 800k subscribers (of 23.6mm in the us in april '11 [1]) or 3% and 77% of their stock price.  The reporter claims this mostly happened because four key executives who had been at netflix basically from the beginning and whom the ceo Reed trusted and listened to had left the company and there was nobody left that he trusted enough to seriously consider their opinions.<p>--------------------------<p>I think the reporting is interesting.  I'd just assumed this whole thing was basically blunt negotiations between the studios and netflix over streaming rights, and that the studios had wanted to get paid per subscriber, whether that subscriber wanted dvds or streaming or both.  Netflix can basically buy dvds and do whatever they want because of the doctrine of first sale, but if the studios don't license content they can't do a damn thing.<p>What's also interesting is I've heard a lot of grumping about netflix from an employees' perspectives.  People seem to get randomly fired.  This jibes with what happened with qwikster.  Reed had already started staffing qwikster up so employees that agreed to switch or had been hired basically got dicked.

You have to explicit permission from the copyright owner to make the recording available for download or interactive streaming, i.e. you can choose when to listen to it.<p>There is a compulsory license in most territories for the composition side, under certain specific conditions, in which an entity like Grooveshark would obtain a mechanical license for the composition from the copyright holder of the composition (usually music publishers) in advance of its public availability, and then account and pay royalties for its use. This requires Grooveshark to know the songwriters, publishers, and splits of each work, which is not something that comes from the user uploads. It may be the case that their terms of use pass this responsibility to the uploader.<p>In short, however, you need sets of permission (sound recording and composition) to legally distribute music for download or interactive streaming.",1342051764

They just have chosen to make enough concessions to secure the cooperation of a DRAM manufacturer so that HP doesn't have to build the whole memristor business themselves. (The way HP's been managed in recent years, I wonder if they would be able to get and hold on to enough capital to mass produce memristors and bring them to market without help.)",1342051740

Less so in the north-east, but in the south and southwest in particular, you can hear the capital F when people say it. It's a political entity that you can either love (with us) or hate (against us). You can't be pro-Freedom if you're not pro-American sort of stuff.<p>Elsewhere 'freedom' is definitely a desirable quality, but it's not a concept that has a life of its own and must be tended to like a pet. 'freedom' isn't something that will stir in your breast and make you fight harder. 'Freedom' seems to be a word that has been incorporated into the US religion of state, and seems to have a tangibly different meaning there.",1342051417

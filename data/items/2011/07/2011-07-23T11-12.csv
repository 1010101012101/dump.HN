The appropriate response to an offense against major community norms is removal from the community.<p>At my university, the punishment for a few copied sentences was a 9-month suspension and a note on your transcript, and professors were specifically instructed <i>not</i> to handle first offenses on their own. Second offenses were handled by permanent expulsion.

We counted the total number of ways that a function could go wrong and saw that in pure Haskell code, the number is drastically reduced.  We know that the bug types we eliminated actually occur in practice, so under the reasonable assumption that the distribution of bug types is relatively constant, those numbers do provide empirical evidence (observational, not experimental) that Haskell programs are more likely to be correct.<p>Yes, pure code can still be wrong, but it can be wrong in a lot less ways than the impure code that you&#x27;re stuck with in other languages.  That code is still doing useful work that is also bug-prone in other languages.  Therefore we can be reasonably confident that it will reduce bugs.<p>If you absolutely insist on experimental evidence, we have that too: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=1207"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BveDrw9CwEg#t=1207</a>",1424120321

You <i>will not</i> make the kind of money you need to sustain a successful freelance consultancy on any of those platforms.<p>I suggest the following (roughly in order of precedence):
* Local networking groups for new businesses (new businesses need new websites. Easy sell.)
* Give talks at local tech meetups (and in the about me section of the talk, mention that you&#x27;re a freelance web developer. Make sure to follow with a really amazing presentation, and you&#x27;ll probably get a couple leads after your talk)
* Have an online portfolio where you list your past work with as many details about the work as possible (don&#x27;t break your NDAs or anything, of course).
* Join gun.io and look for work there. It looks very similar to freelancer.com and similar, but the clients on Gun know that they have to pay for quality work, and in my experience, they&#x27;re willing to do so.
* Contribute to an open source project related to the kind of freelancing that you want to do. For instance, I&#x27;m a PHP developer and I do a ton of work with Drupal. I&#x27;ve gotten almost every job through the Drupal community.<p>The contribution to open source bullet point is last, despite it being the most successful for me, because it&#x27;s not always possible to give an open source project the level of involvement that is needed.

9058916,comment,9057996,9058576,0,0,alexqgb,,,"One of the most notable differences between the Industrial and Information revolutions is that wealth from the former was underwritten by a surge in energy. Wealth from the latter depends on extracting greater value from (more or less) existing supplies. In other words, it&#x27;s largely about the sudden redistribution of output, as opposed to a change in the underlying supply.<p>(Relatively) enlightened governing philosophies and new economic theories aside, the Industrial Revolution also involved a <i>monumental</i> uptick in the amount of raw energy humans had to work with. Until this point, the latent economic power contained within fossil fuels remained out of reach. Population and productivity were both effectively capped by the amount of energy we could actually extract from the environment (e.g., caloric, in the form of crops for people and livestock as well as wind for sails and mills, along with hydro small dams and rivers for transport).<p>Nascent capital markets and industrial processes provided real advantages in this energy-constrained world, but adding steam then oil to the process of industrialization is what really kicked growth into overdrive. This influx of energy (and the economic growth it supported) allowed countries like England to develop populations seven or eight times greater than the agricultural carrying capacity of its arable land in astonishingly short order. The ideas of Adam Smith were important, but wouldn&#x27;t have gotten nearly as far is they didn&#x27;t have actual steam trains and ships to carry the people who subscribed to them.<p>All that said, the transition we&#x27;re going through now is far from complete. Like the early and painfully disruptive days of the Industrial Revolution, the current concerns about stagnation and wealth concentration may give way once we complete another energy transition. A world supplied by highly distributed, low-cost solar and stored energy arrays (batteries, compressed air, molten salt, etc.) could see an increase in the overall supply, in a fashion that liberates a critical mass of people from the more coercive aspects of the global economy. Tapping the sun directly may prove to be as transformative as tapping ancient deposits of carbon. Indeed, the pre-existence of the information layer may prove to be the thing that makes this possible, just as the process of industrialization had begun before the steam engine kicked it into overdrive.<p>The big question for the long-range optimists is how do we maintain social and stability and cohesion during the transition?",1424119802

If I believe that grass is blue, then I live in a neighbourhood of people that believe grass is blue, and all my friends are thus people who believe grass is blue. I watch news that says grass is blue. My Facebook and Twitter feeds frequently show updates that prove grass is blue, and rarely show anything to the contrary other than to scorn it. All these reasonable people that I love and trust all agree that grass is blue. I&#x27;m a reasonable person. So if I meet someone who says grass is <i>not</i> blue, my immediate assumption is that they&#x27;re a wacko, unreasonable, not to be trusted.<p>It kind of makes total sense. If you don&#x27;t do this, you start questioning everything, and it&#x27;s really stressful. You start to become &#x27;that guy&#x27;, nobody wants to spend time with you because you&#x27;re so disagreeable, and you prevaricate on every decision. So you simplify the world by limiting your inputs to those that agree with you. For example, &quot;Should I get my child vaccinated? I&#x27;ve read 3 books for, 3 against, asked doctors and health advisors I found on Google, and talked about it on multiple forums. Opinion seems divided. &quot; vs &quot;I know I should get my child vaccinated, because everyone on Hacker News says so.&quot;<p>At some point, the answer is to have trusted in-person relationships. As I said, I believe in vaccinations because I know our doctor quite well. I know he&#x27;s not a quack, and he says vaccinations are a good thing, and so I believe him. Similarly, if I want to get some good beef, I go to our local butcher who knows my name. I trust him not to sell me horsemeat, in a way that I don&#x27;t trust a big supermarket chain. There&#x27;s no way for me to guarantee that either the doctor or the butcher are right, but it feels a more certain way than trusting /r/cleverusername on Reddit. How do you sort the wheat from the chaff in a society of billions?<p>I often recollect Aristotle&#x27;s comment that &quot;it is difficult - perhaps impossible – for a city that is too populous to be well managed&quot;.

9058856,comment,9051417,9057433,0,0,WojtekB,,,"You keep referring to only a single use case of iBeacon - retail & shopping. This is the biggest market for beacons and retailers surely will use beacons to gather data. But so does Amazon, and I&#x27;d say that more people like Amazon because of offering products they&#x27;re likely to buy, than hate them because they store their shopping history.<p>Anyway, there are lots of other uses of beacons. In other cases, no one claims you&#x27;re getting anything for free. When it comes to dining apps: if they deliver great experience, restaurants will be more likely to use them to keep more clients coming. If Robin&#x27;s smart office software works well, you will pay them to use it, because they&#x27;re a SaaS company. If a museum&#x27;s app makes an exhibition much more entertaining, you&#x27;ll come back to see the next one. There is no &#x27;hidden fee&#x27; anywhere: they use your location data to improve their services. Surely there will be violators, who want to take advantage of this data without offering value in return, but iBeacon is opt-in by design: you need to download the app and give it permission to access your location. What&#x27;s the chance you will keep using an app that isn&#x27;t useful and violates your privacy?<p>Basically, it&#x27;s a bit like with Uber: yeah, you do share your location. And thanks to that, Uber leverages users&#x27; data to adjust fare rates and number of contractors, optimizing their business. But your benefit is clear - you get a great service, much better than huge majority of taxi corporations.<p>As for advertising: from what I&#x27;ve seen, beacon vendors are pretty visible in AdSense and do a ton of retargeting. We do at Estimote, I&#x27;ve also seen banners from Radius Networks, Kontakt.io, Urban Airship, and at least a couple of others. But I&#x27;ve seen their pages a bajilion times, so that makes me a good target for the ads :) There was also a lot of press about beacons in the last few months, especially with Facebook and Groupon entering the space with their pilots.<p>Cheers.",1424119104

I wonder why that is.<p>Two reasons come to mind:<p>1) Since I was a kid, sea-side vacations in the summer were common-place to the point that I actually learned how to swim in the sea. I still remember how surprised I was at the difficulty of swimming in a pool where you are much less buoyant. No salt in the water and all that.<p>And 2) Maybe I just haven&#x27;t swam in choppy enough water. But I do remember that when waves are a certain height above your head, having a surfboard at hand suddenly makes life so much easier. Although even then I didn&#x27;t feel a particular propensity to inhaling water.<p>edit:<p>3) I learned several techniques for swimming in place and resting when you&#x27;re tired. If push comes to shove, you can also just lay on the water pretty much indefinitely. This one doesn&#x27;t work if the water is too choppy though.<p>4) I probably haven&#x27;t swam in a super cold sea yet.

The industrial revolution gets a really bad rap, but compared to the work and life expectancy that preceded it, the condition of workers improved dramatically in the 19th century.<p>I think that is a bit over-enthusiastic. Life was extremely tough for the new industrial workers. I think if you look at measures of health/nutrition like BMI and height, they are static or even slightly declining throughout the 19th century.

9058831,comment,9057996,9057996,0,0,pastProlog,,,"> The three great ones are the agricultural revolution, the industrial revolution, and the one we are now in the middle of—the software revolution.<p>There is a case for skipping over the technological changes that shifted the slave societies of Greece and Rome to the feudal societies of medieval Europe.<p>You can&#x27;t really make one for an important shift 40,000 years before the agricultural revolution.  We went from a world without cave paintings to one with them.  From a world without venus figurines and other carvings to one with one.  With sweeping technological changes in hunting and fishing instruments and so forth.  It&#x27;s the second most important technological revolution ever, if not the first.  If fishing is wrapped up with the human brain modifying into its modern form, wouldn&#x27;t it be the most important?<p>Note that each revolution had a corresponding revolutionary change to political systems, family structures and society.  With the agricultural revolution we had the end of primitive communism and hunter-gatherer societies and the rise of surplus, class systems and slave societies.  Much of the earliest literature such as the Epic of Gilgamesh is on how to catch and keep slaves.<p>With the rise of capitalism we saw the fading of Catholicism and the rise of Protestantism and the &quot;Protestant work ethic&quot;.  We also saw the end of monarchies and the rise of liberal democracies.  The bourgeoisie and proletariat of the time united to overthrow these old systems, but soon began facing off against one another, which is pretty much the history of the 20th century, or if we look at the election of old euro-communists in Greece last month, perhaps the 21st.<p>The famous old definition of economics in our capitalist economy by Robbins is &quot;Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses&quot;.  Scarcity is the bedrock of modern economic analyses - of utility, of supply and demand, of price.<p>What scarcity is there when someone films a movie, or writes a book or magazine article, or records an audio track, and with the press of a button can fly off to billions of Android and iPhone devices?  Or writes an app and flings it across the world as soon as it hits the App Store or Google Play?  Or sends code to Github, which someone in Bulgaria patches, which someone in Brazil patches, which someone in Japan then uses in a product they&#x27;re putting out, glued together to some other framework on Github?<p>This is the end of scarcity.  The most well-paid modern workers are those who produce commodities which are not scarce.  That is if we can call these products commodities - a non-scarce commodity is something of a contradiction.<p>These revolutionary technological changes in production, at the base, will reverberate through the superstructure of political systems, families and societies.  The old superstructure is still trying to keep down or even kill the new one - NSA spying.  DMCA letters.  David Cameron&#x27;s great firewall for porn in England.  IP and patent lawsuits.  The recent New York Times article with investors questioning why Google is building self-driving cars.  Aaron Swartz&#x27;s suicide, when trying to open up taxpayer-funded research which is locked down and privatized by now irrelevant Elsevier.  Telcos using their government granted monopolies to try to harm budding businesses.<p>Revolutions in production lead to revolutions in the relations of production.  In the twentieth century, blue collar workers like railroad engineers and factory mechanics had their hands on the engines running the economy.  As technology and AI causes more and more unemployment for people who can&#x27;t find the derivative of 5x, de facto, if not de jure, power of production goes to those who are rack mounting cloud servers, or rolling out new web site builds.",1424118826

It's not surprising they haven't addressed the concerns of some applications, particularly power user and developer applications. Instituting a sandbox with user controlled permissions seems a solid step for usability and safety. For sure every feature will probably not ever be possible in a sandbox - for that we have regular installations which are not going away any time soon if ever. Apple is smartly trying to establish a trusted installation pattern for desktop applications resembling the experience on iOS, recent snafus notwithstanding.<p>So basically, it's notable that some applications are having difficulty with the first iteration of these new restrictions, but it's not surprising and I'm confident the issues will be resolved in time. Meanwhile, we've all survived without the App Store for a long time. I think these applications can survive. This is not the time for outrage.",1329422172

3600348,comment,3599396,3600146,4,0,shingen,,,"I agree. An invasion of Iran would be a real war, the likes of which we haven't seen since the Korean war.

We'd lose 20,000 soldiers in the first year of combat (obviously all the fighting after the first wave of battles would be guerrilla style). Iran is absolutely nothing like Iraq or Afghanistan, in any way shape or form.<p>It's not that we can't 'win' in an invasion style conflict with Iran - we can certainly flatten the entire country - but the cost would be far beyond anything the American public could stomach. The things we'd have to do to Iran in order to get them to capitulate would be beyond horrendous.<p>I don't believe we can actually afford the cost that would be involved.

3600294,comment,3599991,3599991,47,0,tzs,,,"Wouldn't security-scoped bookmarks solve some of the problems he describes? From the sandbox design guide:<p>--------------------------------<p>Starting in Mac OS X v10.6, the NSURL class and the CFURLRef opaque type each provide a facility for creating and using bookmark objects. A bookmark provides a persistent reference to a file-system resource. When you resolve a bookmark, you obtain a URL to the resources current location. A bookmarks association with a file-system resource (typically a file or folder) usually continues to work if the user moves or renames the resource, or if the user relaunches your app or restarts the system.<p>In an app that adopts App Sandbox, you must use a security-scoped bookmark to gain persistent access to a file-system resource.<p>Security-scoped bookmarks, available starting in Mac OS X v10.7.3, support two use cases:<p> An app-scoped bookmark provides a specific sandboxed app with persistent access to a user-specified file or folder.<p>For example, if your app employs a download or processing folder, present an NSOpenPanel dialog to obtain the users intent to use a specific folder. Then, by creating a security-scoped bookmark for that folder and storing it as part of the apps configuration (perhaps in a property list file or using the NSUserDefaults class), your app acquires a means to obtain future access to the folder.<p> A document-scoped bookmark provides a specific document with persistent access to a file.<p>For example, a code editor typically supports the notion of a project document that refers to other files and needs persistent access to those files. Other examples are an image browser or editor that maintains an image library, in which the library file needs persistent access to the images it owns; or a word processor that supports embedded images, multimedia, or font files in its document format. In these cases, you configure the document format (of the project file, library file, word processing document, and so on) to store security-scoped bookmarks to the files a document refers to. (A document-scoped bookmark can point only to a file, not a folder.)<p>A document-scoped bookmark can be resolved by any app that has access to the bookmark data itself and to the document that owns the bookmark. The document can be a flat file, or a document distributed as a bundle.<p>--------------------------------",1329421151

I'm considering adding a form that lets you output raw JS if you need to optimize something, but I have yet to see the need for that.<p>* Outlet doesn't do anything crazy like CPS. When you call a function ""foo"" with ""(foo 1 2 3)"" it generators a simple function call ""foo(1, 2, 3)"". So you can call native javascript functions normally.<p>You can use arrays and objects inline, like so:<p>(define a [1 2 3 4])<p>(define b {:key ""value"" :another-key ""value2""})<p>Those get generated to normal javascript arrays and objects, so you can pass them as parameters to a native js function if needed.<p>You can even reference objects with ""."" like:<p>(define foo {:one 1 :two 2})<p>(print foo.one)<p>That works as expected. The only difference is vector reference, instead of ""foo[1]"" you would do ""(vector-ref foo 1)"".<p>Of course, this is all subject to change, but the goal of Outlet is to not do something crazy and for things to work as expected.",1329420297

That screen had major usability issues based on the people I tested it with--people were frustrated to find what they tapped on was not a button.<p>Based on what I've read of their iOS reviews, this could really help their ratings. Lots of 1-star reviews about only sharing samples of music, having to buy apps someone 'shared' to you, etc. This is probably fair--Bump atleast gave the impression of promising those things.<p>Their new video is much better than their old one; I can't find the old one, but it was narrated poorly, whereas the new video feels much more professional and helps communicate their use-cases better, even though its still a little hard for me to see two people wordlessly Bumping than sharing a phone number.<p>The new FAQ is really hard to read because the section headings (General,iOS, Android) blend right in with the Qs.<p>I think the larger question though is where does this leave Bump's revenue model?

I'm going to decide based on what vote does the most good or causes the least harm both in this election and in the future, not based on someone's skill at manipulating Google into accepting slanderous definitions.  They're much better off making the case that Romney's position on the issues is untenable, rather than pulling stunts like this.",1329418870

Allowing random apps to access/modify different files on the system (without user explicitly allowing that) kinda defeats the purpose of sandboxing (from user's point of view - from developers POV, sandboxing makes his app more secure and stable).<p>All I see is people ranting about sandboxing's limitations, without coming up with actual plans to improve it.",1329418818

They all stem from one root requirement:<p>Regular websites should work with minimum problems on an iOS device.<p>This is a requirement that made sense when iOS came out years ago, and honestly still makes sense today. It's why browsing on an iOS device is so damn awesome.<p>That explains the different reported size. Once you have a different reported size, you enter the viewport and zoom issues. But at that point, all the decisions intertwine and make sense amongst themselves.<p>Now, why isn't there a 1px=1 physical pixel setting? That's a different question. By which I kind of mean, the retina display is probably the reason there is no such setting. Regardless, that's a missing feature. The ones that are there all make sense, and aren't nearly as foolish as they sound at first glance.",1329418809

Distribute it through your own website. You need to pay to sell through the Mac App Store. I also presume you need to pay if you want it signed. Well that's a privilege. It helps you prove to potential customers your app is safe. You benefit from it so you should have to pay for it.<p>If you develop an app with the purpose of selling it on the Mac App Store for profit $100 should not be a problem for you.<p>If you want to distribute it yourself, go ahead. Apple is not charging you.",1329418801

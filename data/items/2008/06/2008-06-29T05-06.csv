231002,comment,230639,230954,0,0,fallintothis,,,"If either were optimal in every case, this debate would be settled by now.  Yet what matters here, more so than tiny idiosyncrasies in each, is the overarching philosophy each editor has, and whether that maps to your mode of thinking.  I admit this is a dubious answer: our thinking can be restricted by choices we made early on and got used to, but never attempted to improve upon.  If you do attempt to explore beyond what you have tried, by definition you run the chance of regretting lost time in the case where you find a better way of doing something.  But this is a blessing in disguise anyways.  I try not to let such fear (or even complacency, as the case may be) keep me from trying further things unless -- and this is a big, subjective caveat -- I feel as though I stand nothing to gain from pursuing it.  The choice of text editor seems about on par with the choice of any other programming tool, such as a language or version control system.  Not all of them are created equally, except in the technical sense (as in, e.g., Turing equivalence) that, at least in the limit, you can achieve the same things with one tool as another.  Any may be more productive than another, but this is per person, situation, and preference.  The only way to know for certain is to invest time (a precious resource) into learning all that you can.<p>I feel weird making such claims.  For instance, I have very strong opinions over programming languages (though I do try to learn as many different modes of thinking -- in this context, languages -- as I can), yet with text editors I don't feel like I've been stuck with vim as an accident of history.  I genuinely prefer its mode of thinking, despite not becoming an expert in Emacs before making a decision (since doing so is quite impractical).  I also feel the flimsiness of the reply ""depends; try both and see"".  To cut to the chase, luckily we have decades of flamewars to draw upon -- or, at least, the general consensus of the philosophy of either editor.  Choose wisely:<p>Vim: modal editing; small, orthogonal commands that can be composed into more elaborate forms; ""do one thing and do it well"" philosophy, so the main function is as a text editor and there is less concern (except via plugins in its admittedly esoteric extension language) about performing other programmatic tasks not directly related to editing text.<p>Emacs: ""Everything at reach"" philosophy, be it text-editing or access to a REPL, browser, email client, Tetris, etc.; larger set of commands (it's like a CISC to vim's RISC); elisp is a much better extension language; no mode switching, which then requires more key-chording.<p>Whichever sounds nicer, you should probably go with, unless you have the time to dedicate to both -- even a little bit of working in either can help you get a feel for them.  If you don't, they honestly accomplish so much of the same sort of tasks in their respective ways that neither is clearly better than the other (except to their proponents -- did I mention vim is better? ;) ).  Which is encouraging, I think, because it buys you a degree of freedom to use their general philosophies as a grounds for a decision, rather than having to teach yourself every detail about each editor.  You won't be at a terrible loss, whichever you choose.",1214718937

And they have these tech support guys who could actually can understand my noob  language(and showed me around the settings) when i tried to play around with my account.<p>One of my friends from US told me that slicehost is good and i see a lot of fan comments above.<p>I have also been using Google AppEngine since a week. Its blazing fast. But they currently have only free accounts and have mentioned on their blog that they will start a paid cloud hosting service soon for those who reach their free hosting limits. Yahoo! too have announced that they will soon offer cloud hosting. So if u you wait for a couple months you might get to choose between EC2 and Google and Yahoo and slicehost and others. Because if you are using php, i have a wild guess that Yahoo's hosting will be php inclined(most of their services are php-inclined). If u are comfortable with python, go for Google AppEngine.<p>Also a word of CAUTION: if you are going to choose shared hosting packages, then always read terms of service agreement and whatever agreements they have. I once used a one month trial coupon with Hostgator and stumbled upon their T.O.S. It was clearly mentioned that they allow only '50000 inodes' on shared hosting accounts, which in simpler words translates that you can have a max of 50000 files. So if you are going to host something like a social networking site, beware! Your users might get to the max files limit if u are going to have a feature like photo uploading.",1214718601

230991,comment,230778,230778,0,0,mroman,,,"Well, as of right now I am using siteground shared hosting, and have found it to be excellent for the money. Their tech support is fast and knowledgeable,and respectful (I don't expect people to KMA, however, the Godaddy people for example have proven themselves to be incompetent AND disrespectful) their interface is clear and usable, and everything has worked great so far, I feel that they provide a lot of value for the money. I am surprised to not see them mentioned here, they HAVE won a couple of awards, and are the best I have seen since 2003. Disclaimer: I mostly used Godaddy before them (yuck!) yet I have had to use a couple of others for clients, and they were all - invariably - not that great at ALL. Now, if anyone has had a bad experience with them, I would certainly like to know, as I am considering reselling for them as part of a ""includes great hosting"" feature in a comprehensive service package for future clients of mine.",1214718259
230990,comment,230639,230954,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I used vi (vim) for about five years, before switching to emacs (gnu emacs), which I've used for about two. They're both excellent text editors, but are clearly optimized for different things, and have tremendous differences in interface, extensibility, and culture.<p>The big advantage for Emacs lies in being a sort of Lisp virtual machine. It's extensible enough to be nearly an OS in its own right (certainly a ""desktop environment"" or whatever), and has decades of extensions already available for it. Where vi(m) has two fundamental modes (with replace being a submode of insert, I suppose), emacs has modes specific to most tasks -- if you want a mode that integrates with an external Common Lisp (slime), OCaml (tuareg), or Ruby (ruby-mode), it's there. This doesn't just mean syntax highlighting and indenting, it means more abstract things like being able to insert the type signature for a Haskell function under the cursor, jump to the definition of an object's superclass, or check/edit/archive your email. (For a really good example, check out this screencast of Marco Baringer using Slime: <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/~mbaringer/slime.torrent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/~mbaringer/slime.torrent</a> ) Emacs Lisp is not the greatest as Lisp implementations / dialects go, but it has a lot of advantages for extending an editor compared to something like Python or Perl. (I have a suspicion Smalltalk or Forth would work well, though.)<p>I know that vim is extensible, but typically you process a region by typing :%!some_cmd to pipe it back and forth; most integration between vim and external programs that I've observed has been at the level of piping text (in the quintessentially Unixy way). This loses a lot of deeper context that could better tie things together.<p>The main strength of vi, I think, is in its ubiquity. While I use emacs to do most things, I also have a heavily customized environment that I carry around with me. (It's under version control, etc.) I can be extremely productive with it, <i>once I've moved in</i>, but vi is available everywhere. I'm talking about a basic vi (nvi?) with one level of undo and no syntax highlighting, perhaps, but it's still pretty good for editing text, particularly if you're a touch-typist and the interface has become second nature. It edits text. It doesn't tie things together into one harmonious environment, but it edits text, and it's really efficient once you know it.<p>For what its worth, there's an editor called ""mg"" which has the default emacs keyboard config out of the box, but is not really very programmable. While I'm very familiar with the basic keyboard controls, it feels crippled to me. I use it while doing computer setup stuff, because it's in the default OpenBSD install, and it's a decent pager, but it's really not the same.<p>Anyway, that's my experience with each. Emacs seems far more powerful in the long run, but it takes quite a bit more time to learn to use it to anywhere near its full capacity, and doing so will rely on carrying around your configuration. (It also has a relatively alien culture and vocabulary, which takes some getting used to.) Vi does what it does everywhere, but cannot grow indefinitely to fit your needs. It's focused on just being a good text editor, rather than a full environment. If you're talking years, though, I would definitely give emacs a shot.<p>(Incidentally, I think emacs is quite reasonable under the Dvorak keyboard layout (better than qwerty, I think), while vi feels far more awkward. The hjkl keys get scattered badly, for one thing. That, a growing fascination with Lisp, and being utterly blown away by the Slime screencast were why I ultimately switched.)",1214717818

At first there was a ""Click to Contact"" button that then forwarded to a Wufoo form- just email, website, (optional) phone number, and a comment.<p>I read that stat, and put up a ""Quick Contact"" form (also Wufoo- they rock :) ). It just had email, and website, and said ""Plug in your email and website and we'll respond with a full proposal for the project."" (We only provide one service so it's pretty standardized.). Whereas before we were getting about one lead every other day, we started getting 1.5 a day, an increase of 200%.<p>We then removed phone number and website from the contact form, since the majority of respondents put that in the actual contact form- immediately, we went from 1.5 to 2 a day. When dealing with leads for development gigs at a couple thousand a pop, that extra .5 helps a lot.<p>Anecdotal, evidence ahoy, but hopefully that helps some.",1214717595

How do you entice casual players to really get into the game and play for quite a while but also reward hardcore players for putting in lots of time? There are so many tradeoffs to make, and considering what an organization like Blizzard must have had to think about is a good exercise.",1214717086

Go to adbrite.com and spend $5 a day on a run of network text ad or go into there directory and find sites with about 1000 to 5000 visitors and sign up for the CPM advertising.  It will cost you about $.05 to $.25 a day per site.  I use it, works good, and is a great price.<p>3. Search for ""web2.0 directory"" on Google and submit to each one.

""Getting other people to do what you want"" doesn't really cut to the core of the matter.<p>Jobs and Wozniak, Gates, Torvalds, Brin and Page, these people are all quite well off financially (to say the least).  But that's not what's impressive about them, at least, not to me.  They've all had a huge effect on the way that our world runs.<p>Clearly, there is a link between money and power---money buys power, and power can be turned into money---but they're quite not the same thing.  Money can only affect the world by getting people to do things in exchange for it.  Someone who makes a billion dollars through wise investing is not the same kind of animal as someone who foresaw a major shift in society and had the moxy and brains to push it forward.<p>Also in this power list are people like Tim Berners-Lee, Djikstra, and Knuth.  The kind of power that politicians have seems transient and shallow by comparison.  In 10 years, George Bush will be just another ex president who threw his army around.

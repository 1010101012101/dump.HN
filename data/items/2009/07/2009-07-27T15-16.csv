I first tried it about a year ago and I can say it's come a long way since then, there's been a lot of improvement and everyday new people are coming on board (at least users). The development team is awesome and give great support on the mailing list or through IRC.<p>At my company we are currently using Asterisk, but are in the process of switching to Freeswitch. Everything seems very well thought out, and in my opinion, it is way simpler than Asterisk. There are many modules for a lot of different functionality, there's support for javascript, lua, perl, java, C, C#, ruby, python, php, a skype gateway, and many more.",1248707599

The numbers on the leaderboard are <i>not</i> the scores on the training set.<p>The netflix prize uses <i>three</i> datasets: the training set, the leaderboard set, and the test set.  The training set is distributed to everyone.  The test set is totally secret.  Access to the leaderboard set is only by submitting results (once per 24 hours) and looking at the results.  It is not at all trivial to ""overfit"" to this leaderboard set.  (It could be done by, e.g. submitting results with slight tweaks to the algorithm parameters, but this would take a lot of time since you can only submit every 24 hours.  Also, you would basically have to do it consciously.)",1248707562

725973,comment,725314,725487,0,0,bsd_junkie,,,"I think a site that was submitted here about a month ago has almost the same features except that they fetch news from everywhere, not just HN and order them based on several interesting scores like ""popular"", ""controversial"", etc. 
They call it <a href=""<a href=""http://www.euraeka.com>All"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.euraeka.com>All</a> the news that's fit to read</a>. Pretty bold claim:-)
From what I can see on their site, when you register you can ""save"" your sorting preferences (click on Advanced at the top of the site) and the site also allows you to filter by topic and domain. I am personally using it for their recommendations system. Truth be told, all news sites are really just a portal so you can find what's interesting to you. Once a system is trained on recommending you what you like, then all the sorting, scoring, mashing up, etc becomes pointless. That's goal really of every information providing site - customize the information flow to every user to the point that every user sees a unique version of the site based on their unique preferences.
So, while I like the sortable HN concept ultimately it needs to be extended to a personalized recommendation news system in order to be truly useful. Euraeka and Google News are two sites that I like, Digg's recommendations frankly suck in my opinion.
Good luck to you though, good stuff.",1248707428

Studies show kids learn best via repetition and pick up language faster the more you talk to them (surprise surprise). Flash cards address both those learning modes by both repeating words and giving you prompts to expound about them, i.e. ""a beaver swims in the water."" Quite simply, by using them I find I talk to my son more and in a more directed (learning appropriate) way.<p>Second, as a stay-at-home dad who also works on startups, I am searching for good (educationally-oriented) ways to entertain and occupy my son. I have a two-28""-monitor setup.

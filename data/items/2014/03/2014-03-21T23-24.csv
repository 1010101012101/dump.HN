7445836,comment,7445761,7445761,15,0,danso,,,"Wow, this seems like a rather large change -- with a lot of dynamics and moving parts -- for what seems like a relatively minor problem on HN. Not that there <i>aren&#x27;t</i> bad comments, but bad comments get a lukewarm response, and insightful comments seem to do pretty well. Comments that get more airtime than they might deserve will still get approved by <i>someone</i> (and upvoted/downvoted accordingly)<p>The bigger problem to me seems to be that great comments that come in a few hours after the posting of a hot submission will almost never reach the top of the comment stack, because older comments that are decent enough will inevitably keep getting upvotes by every new reader of the thread. I&#x27;m not sure what the best tweak for that is, but the proposed feature at hand would seem to exacerbate the situation.<p>Note: OK, I&#x27;ve realized I made the archetypical dickish HN comment (&quot;OK the OP is interesting but on a tangent, why don&#x27;t we all discuss this other thing <i>I</i> care about?&quot;)...but I do think the proposed feature will have a direct impact on the circulation of fresh, insightful comments. I&#x27;m a 1000+ Karma user, but after I&#x27;ve read a thread a couple of times, I probably won&#x27;t re-check it...I can&#x27;t be the only HN&#x27;er who has this lack of attention span...and so this queue, even if perfectly implemented, would seem even more to suppress new comments (unintentionally)",1395446388

7445828,comment,7445685,7445726,9,0,conanbatt,,,"There are many huge cultural and socioeconomic implication of Basic Income.<p>Inflation is dependent on money supply, you don&#x27;t need to print new money to apply basic income. You would worry as much of its inflation impact as you would for bailing out banks, if its the same printing. Its not a BI specific concern.\nPricing, on the other hand, would probably change drastically, as there would probably be a solid market of goods for people that want to get by with BI alone, so essentials will probably be priced to fit perfectly with BI.<p>On the second point: Basic Income is guaranteed, regardless of other jobs. So you would work at McDonalds if you wanted more money. Otherwise it creates the perverse incentive not to work which you described.<p>BI could be nefarious or the savior socioeconomic rule, and it deserves experimentation.<p>Personally, I find its socio-economic impacts the most interesting and important in shaping a society. With BI, the jobs nobody wants to do will experience a reverse Supply/Demand.<p>Cleaning toilets today is cheap because you have enough people that need it to survive: when they dont need it anymore, the supply for those jobs will plummet, and suddenly they will start earning way more money. I find this to be such a strong positive force that this alone justifies doing BI to me.<p>Also, it will very quickly destroy crime. Petty theft and small crimes have no reason to exist anymore, since you dont need to steal to eat or to try to get out of a desperate situation. Specially if being in Jail means you dont get your BI (because its used for prison budgets) it creates a magnificent economical incentive not to do crime and to get out of jail as fast as you can. Organized crime like drug dealers would likely plummet as well: as most organizations they are heavily pyramidal and require a vast number of poor people to work for peanuts and take all the risk. Take them away, and they have no supply chain, so even large organizations will get wrecked quickly. Suddenly, White-collar crime goes way higher in the scale of important.<p>In terms of society education, you will prevent and help millions of people to be able to pursue education without having to sacrifice it to make ends meet.<p>Another strongly positive force is to eliminate government &quot;fat&quot;. Firing government employees that are useless or provide little value is a very politically expensive move no-one makes, because nobody wants to throw people on the street. Now, this is not the street anymore, they have a strong safety net so we can stop worrying about politics and focus on making things productive.<p>I clearly see a lot of potential on BI, and I also appreciate it could have devastating downsides. But thats what experimentation is all about finding out.",1395446350

That&#x27;s progress for YC, which up until now seemed to have its head in the sand.<p>The quick roll up of what you&#x27;ve heard most recently, also good, shows it&#x27;s more than lip service.<p>*Acknowledging publicly that confidence shows differently for women than for men is enormous.  I&#x27;ve had people try to claim I&#x27;m not confident in my product.

Or some such realistic but achievable number.<p>Understand that women need special help fundraising. The signals, games, and rules are male created, and male oriented.  Women are at a distinct disadvantage in the fundraising process as a result.  I have found most women cannot give good fundraising advice, because they have not raised money, or have they invested money.  Would love to see YC write about this, specifically for women.  A rule book, if you will.<p>There&#x27;s probably more, but as you keep engaging us, I&#x27;ll keep thinking.<p>To those who might still be angry/cynical: This is a start.

I think, though, that basic income breaks a lot of assumptions that hold for economics today, but wouldn&#x27;t hold in such a scenario.<p>Basic income might lead to inflation. It&#x27;s impossible for the basic income to become worthless, though, unless all money becomes worthless. Even if everyone gets $X a month, any other amount of money can be expressed as a multiple of X.<p>McDonalds in this situation could pay zero wage, if anyone wanted to work at this price. I doubt many would, though. Instead, they would pay $Y in addition to the $X that everyone already gets.<p>Ideally, no one works at McDonalds, because it&#x27;s automated. If it can&#x27;t be automated, then McDonalds has to pay people enough to make it worth working at McDonalds, not just enough to survive. This increases the price of things that aren&#x27;t automated, which increases the reward for those who can figure out how to automate it.<p>(Objecting to this automation by pointing out how far away we are from AI / useful robots is like objecting to flight by pointing out how many joints are in a bird&#x27;s wing. An automated McDonalds will look different than what we have today. Perhaps insisting on human hands preparing and serving their food will become an affection of the wealthy.)",1395446183

Most serious suggestions of a basic income don&#x27;t involve just printing a huge amount of cash and mailing it out. They&#x27;re about taxing high earners more, saving a bunch of money on other social programs (and probably police and stuff as well), and then distributing that money to everyone. If you balance that out instead of just increasing the money supply, it might not cause crazy inflation.<p>To the second - they pay whatever they need to pay to get the workers they need. Everyone is already getting $X a week from the basic income. Fast food workers will make a total of $X+Y a week, and doctors will earn $X+Z, where Z is probably a lot more than Y.<p>Also, remember basic incomes are typically suggested to be enough to live on and no more - so if you want some luxury items (whatever we decide those are) you&#x27;ll probably need to get a job somewhere.

The gained productivity allows McDonald&#x27;s prices to drop, and a (properly configured) tax eats a healthy portion of McDonald&#x27;s new profits. That tax goes directly into the basic income fund, lifting <i>all</i> citizens basic income by some amount.<p>People are still incentives to do icky jobs now (because they get more than basic income) and as they disappear, those efficiencies become profit, which is taxed and dumped into basic income which then goes up (so we lift everyone to higher standards of living as we destroy jobs people no longer need to do)<p>Eventually, that process repeats in every business and every industry, until we live in a Star Trek style post-currency economy, where people only work for exercise / interest / fun, and all necessities are covered by machines for some amount near free.<p>It&#x27;s not an overnight thing, it&#x27;s a &quot;spread out over the next century&quot; type change, where basic income started at the US minimum wage, but (over 100 years) eventually gives folks the 100-year-from-now equivalent of 100k/year salary as basic income.",1395445886

Demand is at such a high rate that it isn&#x27;t financially feasible to eliminate factory farms. There&#x27;s also the environmental aspect - meat is very resource-intensive, and a huge source of pollution [2]. A UN report from 2010 stated that &quot;a global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change.&quot; [3]<p>This goes not only for meat, but for animal products in general (the dairy and egg industries cause just as much, if not more, suffering than the meat industry).<p>Eating meat can be morally justified if it&#x27;s done in a humane way, I think. The problem is that unless you have your own small-scale farm, it&#x27;s almost impossible to find animal products that aren&#x27;t the result of suffering.

From now on, when\nyou post a comment, it won&#x27;t initially be live.\nIt will be in a new state called pending.  Comments\nget from pending to live by being endorsed by multiple\nHN users with over 1000 karma.  Those users will see\npending comments, and will be able to endorse them by\nclicking on an &quot;endorse&quot; link next to the &quot;flag&quot; link.<p>Someone who has a pending comment will have to wait till\nit goes live to post another.  We&#x27;re hoping that good\ncomments will get endorsed so quickly that there won&#x27;t\nbe a noticeable delay.<p>You can currently beat the system by posting an innocuous\ncomment, waiting for it to be endorsed, and then after\nit&#x27;s live, changing it to say something worse. We explicitly\nask people not to do this.  While we have no software\nfor catching it, humans will notice, and we&#x27;ll ban you.<p>Along with the change in software will come a change in\npolicy.  We&#x27;re going to ask users with the ability to\nendorse comments only to endorse those that:<p>1. Say something substantial.  E.g. not just a throwaway remark,\nor the kind of &quot;Yes you did, No I didn&#x27;t&quot; bickering\nthat races toward the right side of the page and no\none cares about except the participants.<p>2. Say it without gratuitous nastiness.  In particular,\na comment in reply to another comment should be written\nin the spirit of colleagues cooperating in good faith\nto figure out the truth about something, not\npoliticians trying to ridicule and misrepresent\nthe other side.<p>People who regularly endorse comments that fail one\nor both of these tests will lose the ability to\nendorse comments.  So if you&#x27;re not sure whether you\nshould endorse a comment, don&#x27;t.  There are a lot of\npeople on HN.  If a point is important, someone else\nwill probably come along and make it without gratuitous\nnastiness.<p>I hope this will improve the quality of HN comments\nsignificantly, but we&#x27;ll need your help to make it work,\nand your forbearance if, as usually happens, some\nthings go wrong initially.",1395445771

Identification is probably what most criminal cases are about and being able to get to know someone’s name and to make a photo of them is not the actual relevant part of the identification for solving a crime.<p>Conceptually I would agree that this is more similar to facial composites (it’s a recreation of the suspect’s face not directly via a photograph but via some other means, either memory or, in this case, DNA) but comparing it to mug shots is not absurd or even weird. There is even a good argument one could make that this is conceptually more similar to mug shots than facial composites: both photos and DNA don’t rely on someone else via memory but directly on the suspect.<p>Since mug shots are well known making the comparison for the sake of a headline makes perfect sense.

Before we can even talk about our future binary overlords being hostile or friendly, we will have to study how basic, but constantly developing, AI integrates and plays off of human social systems.

7445683,comment,7444582,7445324,3,0,bunderbunder,,,"> We don&#x27;t want Garbage Collection to the contrary we want reference counting. Reference counting is the best compromise between handling memory manually and using GC ala Java. I would argue that the mental strain for the programmer is equal for reference counting(at least with ARC) to that of GC. However Reference Counting is extremely lightweight.<p>I used to think that, until I started to spend more time on modern GC platforms like Java and .NET.  It&#x27;s impressive how  performant a good generational garbage collector can be.  For many business applications (i.e., not the kinds of workloads you&#x27;ll see being simulated by popular benchmarks) a good generational GC can even <i>improve</i> performance thanks to improved locality of reference.  I think a lot of us don&#x27;t fully appreciate the cost of a cache miss.<p>Speaking of, I&#x27;m not sure a lot of us fully appreciate the cost of synchronization, either.  It&#x27;s one big reason why I&#x27;m not convinced that reference counting is particularly well-suited to concurrent programming, since it turns a really commonplace operation (retaining a reference to an object) into a synchronization point in the program.  There&#x27;s a non-trivial cost associated with that.  You could avoid repeatedly stalling the CPU by being very careful about not sharing objects among threads, but I don&#x27;t think most developers can reasonably be expected to make a habit of that in practice.",1395444700

Facebook is an existence proof that there is no &quot;PHP hole&quot; that they are in, that it&#x27;s largely a myth propagated by programming language nerds who have never tried scaling a site in PHP. When was the last time you heard about a site closing up because of PHP-induced technical debt? You don&#x27;t. People re-write sites because of poor architecture, not because of poor programming languages, and PHP (in general) does not prevent you from building a site with good architecture, both from a software structural standpoint and an operational standpoint.<p>PHP&#x27;s APIs are ugly. It&#x27;s language semantics are a bit hairy until you get the hang of it. But there are parts of PHP that are extremely elegant and easy to reason about. It&#x27;s OOP support provides all that you need to produce re-usable and easily understood code.<p>Facebook&#x27;s work on PHP has focused on largely two dimensions: reducing CPU cycles and increasing static/runtime type checking. The former is something that only really matters at massive scale: PHP is generally fast enough since most of the time PHP processes are I/O bound reading from a database or memcached. It&#x27;s only for sites like Facebook where if you squeeze out an additional 10% TPS from your boxes that you will start seeing large absolute cost reduction that this level of optimization starts to make sense. On the type checking side, this is something you might start to want in <i>any</i> dynamically typed language when you have millions of lines of code and want to ensure basic guarantees that it will run, and is something that you&#x27;d probably see Facebook doing if they were a Ruby or Python shop anyway. It has nothing to do with PHP but with the classic dynamic vs static typing tradeoff.<p>Should you be writing your chat server in PHP? No. But 90% of the code you write for a large website is HTTP response code rendering HTML or JSON. PHP excels at this and you can pretty much hire any developer off the street to start cranking out code if you give them a solid foundation to build on.",1395444358

A self-improving AI… we won&#x27;t even see it coming.  There is also much more brainpower dedicated to &quot;fixing&quot; industrial capitalism, than addressing existential risks such as AI.  And industrial capitalism doesn&#x27;t need fixing, it needs to be abolished altogether.<p>Corporations are even less autonomous than the author thinks.  Sure, kill a CEO, and some other shark will take its place.  On the other hand, those sharks are all from the same families.  Power is still hereditary.<p>If the people were truly informed about how the current system works, it would collapse in minutes.  To take only one example, Fractional Reserve Banking is such fraud that if everyone suddenly knew about it, there would be some serious &quot;civil unrest&quot;, to put it mildly.<p>The same does not apply to an AI.  It&#x27;s just too powerful.  Picture the how much smarter <i>we</i> are from chimps.  Now take an army of chimps, and a small tribe of cavemen (and women), which somehow want to exterminate each other.  Well, the chimps don&#x27;t stand a chance, if the humans have any time to prepare.  They have fire, sticks, lances…  Their telepathy have unmatched accuracy (you know, speech).  And they can predict the future far better than the chimps.  Now picture how much more intelligent than <i>us</i> an AI would be.<p>It&#x27;s way worse.<p>---<p>Now, this new agey speak about information taking a life of its own… It doesn&#x27;t work that way.  Sure, there&#x27;s an optimization process at work and it is not any particular human brain.  But this optimization process is nowhere near as dangerous as a fully recursive one (that is, an optimization process that optimizes <i>itself</i>).  And for <i>that</i> to happen, we need to crack a few mathematical hurdles first, like Löb&#x27;s theorem.<p>But that&#x27;s not the hard part.  The hard part is to figure out what goals we should program into the AI.  Not only we need to pin them down to mathematical precision, but we don&#x27;t even know what humanity wants.  We don&#x27;t even know what &quot;what humanity wants&quot; even <i>mean</i>.  Hell, we don&#x27;t even know if it has any meaning at all.

7445547,comment,7443420,7444959,5,0,scarmig,,,"Controversial is different from unspeakable--just because people get in trouble when they talk about something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not spoken about. I read PG&#x27;s essay as about something deeper.<p>To give an example in the present day: imagine you believed a gender or race was literally subhuman, in the sense that you had every right to do whatever you wanted to the Thing. <i>That</i> is something that was a widespread belief in the past but is now simply unspeakable. Note that we&#x27;re not talking about race and IQ, which is still &quot;allowed&quot; to be spoken of, in the sense that people can and do talk about it, even if other people vociferously disagree with the person. But also note the framing the race-and-IQ folk themselves use when talking about it: they bend over backwards to claim that they think race has no bearing on whether a person has rights or equal moral status. It&#x27;s always framed as a purely scientific statement which, although perhaps having policy implications, says nothing about the moral status of the person designated as more likely to have a low IQ. Someone arguing otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be denounced but altogether written out of rational discourse.<p>When PG talks about the unspeakable assumptions and fashions of an age, that&#x27;s what I read him as talking about. In general, I mean, not about race in particular. It also goes to show that just because something is a widely shared assumption of an age doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s wrong.[1]<p>[1] But isn&#x27;t it interestingly meta that I can reference universally shared moral assumptions and use the fact that they are universally shared as rhetorical evidence that they&#x27;re good and useful?",1395443071

In both cases, its a way to ascribe a dismissive blanket <i>explanation</i> to discrimination (from whatever motivation) that the speaker disagrees with. Its probably true that some discrimination against muslims is fear, and some against women is hate, but the use of the blanket terms &quot;Islamophobia&quot; or &quot;misogyny&quot; for that discrimination is a way to assert that it is invalid, slap a neat explanation on it, and dismiss it all in a neat package that resists discussion.",1395443042

Or maybe number of characters in comments / 10, where only those comments posted by people with Karma of >10 are counted? Or maybe there should be a longetivity modifier, where a topic that was heavily voted up and discussed at length should stay for, say, twice as long as a topic that was just voted heavily up? <p>Or there could be a &#39;Top Discussions&#39; side by side with &#39;Top&#39; so there&#39;s a different filter for people looking for news (which you want to be recent and not obscured by long running threads) and people looking for discussions (which I&#39;d argue will be more valuable if the popular ones are kept around for a while).<p>Open for abuse, most definitely, but if the purpose of this site is to build community, I think those topics that get discussed should be more easily accessed. Ideally people would appreciate some valuable discussion and upvote the thread, but this thread here is a perfect example of one that should probably stick around for a while, but has nearly 3x as many comments as upvotes.<p>Just throwing ideas out - tell me if I&#39;m crazy.",1172466822

They require you to raise or invest around $100k in a US business.  The lawyer who told me about the E-2 was quick to warn that the applications get scrutinized hard.  It sounded political, vaguely sketchy, expensive, and complicated.",1172466509

Firefox is a bit of a selective user base to begin with (the +/- 10% userbase are probably very heavily weighted towards the tech savvy), and if you could get critical mass for one site that has a large Firefox user base on which the chat would be very helpful (say, Wikipedia) spreading out from there could be just a matter of time if you play your cards right.<p>Also, I haven&#39;t tried it, but I do hope there&#39;s an option to easily disable it because, after all, _I_ am only looking at the realnursestakeiteverywhere.com for educational purposes, but I definitely don&#39;t want to talk with those _other_ losers there.",1172466031

So you claiming that those things are bad, is no different from saying islam is bad, which is far more racist than what the grandparent post was saying. He merely claimed that large amounts of muslim-only areas are causing problems, whereas you&#x27;re the way of life that makes someone a muslim is immoral.<p>Believe it or not, different religions don&#x27;t just differ in dress and the form of the cross in the front of the building, they have different values. Islam was created by a military conqueror, it&#x27;s values center around that. The basic promise of islam is not that allah will give muslims a good or healthy or happy life like Christianity promises, it&#x27;s that allah will make them victorious over others. The return effort that is demanded from muslims is that they should make allah victorious. And yes, that last statement is followed by, if possible without fighting if needed by any means necessary.<p>As if that wasn&#x27;t enough to make your post racist, you put another whopper in there : &quot;And I&#x27;d prefer schools to conform to a national curriculum&quot;. You want to take the right of people to educate their children as they see fit away ... How is forced education into a state-sanctioned ideology any different than what&#x27;s called indoctrination in China ?<p>Your post is not just far more racist than the posts you&#x27;re complaining about, it&#x27;s also far more worrying.

There are pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s on both sides. I agree with Mark that the sensor (or sensor like) User Experience is much smoother and more natural than scanning QR Codes. The time investment is lower, and it&#x27;s just plain easier for consumers to understand / use. However, sensors have a physical proximity requirement (aka range). What if the consumer is out of range? Another potential issue for sensors; The automated nature of sensors creates a potential for excessive push abuse. Just imagine your phone beeping every time you walk past a store in a mall and you can&#x27;t stop it from happening. There are other issues that affect both Sensors and QRCodes, such as security. If I remember correctly, I think a few people experienced this at Defcon (scan the QRCode, infected with malware). Same could be said for sensors (hypothetical of course, but imagine a sensor pushing malware to you automatically?). These are or will become real issues. I think Kevin had some good points about the Business Model, it was pretty unclear to me as well. If fact, I didnt even know it was a paid app until I read this article. And even then, I think investors prefer a reoccurring revenue model over the one-time payment. Anyway, very cool for them, and I wish them success. My only gripe with the whole thing was the Design. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a Designer, but I was not impressed at all by the Design.",1381631745

Make DNS changes work automatically and immediately (trust me, it&#x27;s perfectly doable even in large environments).

And that is that the money gets stolen.<p>Many poor countries suffer from corrupt callous and cruel leadership. And this means that the people in power tend to steal from the poor. Thus, if some organization tries to 
give cash to the poor there is a high likelihood that the money will be stolen and sent to a swiss bank.<p>It is much more difficult to steal bags of grain with &quot;US AID&quot; printed on them. They are heavy transport is expensive and no-one will pay full price for bags of grains that say US AID on them because they will know it is stolen. If you want to re-bag the grain, it will be a lot of work, and you will have to hire many workers some of which may inform the US embassy. Thus, once the US government dumps a bunch of grain in a poor place, even the evil corrupt warlords tend to leave most of it to the poor because it is too difficult to steal it and sell it.<p>There is a similar problem with cash crops. Initially when I heard activists complain about cash crops, I said &quot;what is the problem? Farmers should farm cash crops in order to get the maximum amount of money for their land and labor.&quot; Well the problem is that if you plant cash crops (such as coffee,  cocoa, etc.) you have to sell them to get some money out of them. But the local corrupt official and/or warlord will take control of all the merchants and make sure the farmers receive very little and take most of the money for himself. If, on the other hand the farmers plant ordinary food, it is very difficult for warlord to steal it. He will have to make his troops do actual agriculture work to steal the food, and they hate that.<p>So this will only work for countries with relatively strong civil society and there are very few of those among the poor countries.",1381630941

3570918,comment,3570462,3570868,1,0,Sander_Marechal,,,"The return path works just like normal. Just hit the dial-back button on your phone or VoIP software and the phone that I used to phone you will start ringing. It gets interesting when we both have SIP/ENUM. I could call you from my mobile when I am at home and, when you ring me back, my home phone could ring because my SIP preference says to use that first.<p>The only tricky thing is your own SIP/ENUM preference. It needs to know where incoming calls need to go. But that can be automated (e.g. your phone sees your home wifi network and thus sets the preference to ring the home phone first).<p>Other neat stuff is possible too. One of my coworkers has linked his home phone to his cellphone. When you call his home number, both his home phone and cell phone will ring, even when he is at work. Whichever device answers first gets the call.",1328792293

3570904,comment,3570353,3570353,1,0,cmorrisrsg,,,"A viable solution going forward is to have browsers implement both the vendor-prefixed and non-vendor-prefixed versions of a property, but use the vendor-prefixed one preferentially.  That would allow developers to use one non-prefixed rule in the common case where all supporting browsers implement the rule in the same way, but developers can target particular browsers if they deviate.  Or if you're worried about the standard deviating, support vendor-rule and x-rule at the same time.<p>For the current webkit- mess, it's probably best to just have the vendors implement each others prefixes on a case-by-case basis (when you know the semantics are the same).  There are way fewer browser vendors than there are website developers, and it's much easier to get them all in a room to agree on something.",1328792094

3570845,comment,3569443,3570729,1,0,moonchrome,,,">No, I'm saying that if no money flows to developers, it's suboptimal because consumers lose out too.<p>But that's my point, Linux/Android, and by extension most of opensource, work mostly outside of IP protections and are able to match closed source and compete. I see no reason why Google wouldn't be able to use it's business model without IP. So even now it works, without IP the entire industry would be forced to restructure.<p>Again - the demand doesn't disappear - you just need to find new ways of satisfying it while making a profit. Just because it's not obvious and would cost a lot of companies their business doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Apple is sitting on billions of dollars in cash on hand and protecting ""multitouch"". Apple's profit is largely due to it's IP monopoly, if knockoffs and iterative improvements were allowed under different brands Apple's competitive edge after the first mover advantage wears off (and seeing how long it takes phones to hit the market with Android for eg. it's a significant window of opportunity) would be efficient production, more innovation and marketing, all of which create extra value to the consumer. So they would be forced to invest in product more aggressively, margins would shrink without innovation - you would have a more competitive market. Production would have to be restructured to even further protect trade secrets (which would screw cheap China manufacturers because they can't be trusted with IP sensitive jobs if they can sell knockoffs). Conversely they would need less to protect from legal threats.",1328790811

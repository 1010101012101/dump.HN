5860210,comment,5858387,5858387,1,0,skwirl,,,"I am glad a post like this reached the front page.  There have been many aspects of this story that are odd to me and should be odd to anyone here once they move past the visceral outrage of being told the NSA has direct access to your e-mails and Facebook account.  Obviously other people realize this, but I haven&#x27;t seen many comments about it (and I have to blame myself partly for that).<p>I find it odd that the NSA has managed to basically gain admin access to the databases of Facebook, Google, Skype, Microsoft, etc. without anyone working for these tech companies coming forward.  I know some people have proposed theories as to why, but I haven&#x27;t found them to be very convincing.<p>I also find the denials from all of these companies puzzling if the NSA slides are accurate.  While some people have tried to read non denials out of the denials, these readings have seemed contrived as several of them seem pretty air tight to me when I read them (Google&#x27;s is a good example).<p>The $20 million annual price tag is also laughable, especially to those who have a feel for how much large technical projects cost (and this one would be gigantic).<p>If we found out that PRISM was simply a software system for companies to comply with FISA warrants that they were already complying with, with those companies pushing data related to individually identified persons and without supplying any more data than they already were or are legally required to, I would not be overly surprised.  And this entire thing would be a non story.  The details definitely matter.<p>What really keeps me from settling on that idea entirely is that I don&#x27;t think that could be true without Snowden having some kind of malicious intent (or being very mistaken about the nature of the systems he had access to).  He seems like a true believer civil libertarian, and does not seem evil or stupid.<p>If this program is really nothing special, than the government should have no problem declassifying more information about it.  But even if they do, will we believe them?",1370933981

The fact of the matter is this - what the government has done is intrinsically unconstitutional. People calling the leaker a traitor try to back it up with the fact that he signed a non-disclosue agreement and that the law approved by a secret court says PRISM is constitutional.<p>Well isn&#x27;t this a nice, little euthyphro dillemma? If congress rules that PRISM is unconstitutional, Snowden is suddenly NOT a traiter anymore?<p>Another thing - constantly mentioning &quot;security&quot; as a reason for surveilling an entire state just proves how much americans think with their fear, instead of their brain. Not a lot of other countries have this problem.<p>Lastly, by definition, U.s. is now a fascist state.<p>1.Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia<p>Check.<p>2.Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of &quot;need.<p>Check<p>3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists.<p>Check.<p>4.Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread\ndomestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.<p>Check.<p>5.Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.<p>Check.<p>6. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.<p>Check<p>7. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite<p>Check.<p>8. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.<p>Check<p>The reason Snowden is hunted down is because he embarrassed the u.s. government. Not because he is a traitor, not because he aided Enemy(whoever that may be).<p>Stop watching the tv and absorbing the propaganda you&#x27;re fed, and you&#x27;ll realize much more.",1370933906

There have certainly been newer works in the same vein, such as V for Vendetta, but they generally have just used the same palette, the same terminology, the same ideological formulations.<p>However, I think those formulations are out of date and their out-of-dateness is harmful to this critical discussion about the nature and importance of liberty and its relationship to governance.<p>Our terminology, our mental models, even our archetypes are best-suited to the world of the 1930s and &#x27;40s, not to today. We throw around terms like fascism and tyranny and they lose a lot of their force because they are not really applicable. That&#x27;s not to say that there is no danger of the industrialized, democratic nations slipping into forms of governance which are every bit as bad as tyranny or fascism, but we must recognize that when we use terminology that is not 100% applicable it makes it that much easier to dismiss or ignore.<p>History is replete with examples of tyrants who have ruled harshly to further their own self-interests or out of a sense of megalomania. But I think we need to recognize that limitations to personal liberty need not be due solely to tyranny or fascism and so forth, there are other forces, other modus operandi at play. People have tried using the term &quot;nanny state&quot;, but that has the opposite problem of lacking sufficient gravitas.<p>There is a very real movement that has been underway for over a century to limit individual liberty in the service of the greater good. The war on drugs is an extension of this phenomenon, as are the worst excesses in the war on terror.

Smith seems pretty clear as does California Bankers Association, and when you take these two cases together, then dragnet surveillance would not be under different rules and Smith would govern this.<p>However I am not certain that this is the only way to look at the existing precedents.  If you look at Rhenquist&#x27;s majority opinion in Knotts, for example, he is quite clear that whether widescale tracking is under the same rules is not a question the court was deciding.  Knotts is important for the Verizon order because I think one can argue that beeper cases are closer to cell site location information (also disclosed under the Verizon order) than they are to pen registers.<p>Since Knotts leaves explicitly open the question of whether widespread location tracking is under different rules, I think it is premature to just say that Smith and California Bankers Association control on their face.  Additionally it is anything but clear what the Supreme Court said about this in Jones v. United States because it isn&#x27;t clear how to count the votes.  I would argue that Sotomayor and Alito do <i>not</i> control, but the fact that you have 5 justices clearly edgy about such things in their separate opinions (Alito concurring in judgement joined by Breyer, Ginsberg, and Kagan, Sotomayor concurring with Scalia but endorsing Alito&#x27;s views).<p>If I had to say what the law <i>is</i> in this case I would say this:<p>The law is currently unclear.  There is, however, a bunch of Supreme Court opinion which seems to give permission to circuit courts to figure this issue out.<p>Edit:  I would also like to point out that the third circuit has held that historical cell site location information is at least potentially protected under the 4th Amendment, and that magistrates have the power to deny ordering disclosure of such on the basis of such 4th Amendment concerns.

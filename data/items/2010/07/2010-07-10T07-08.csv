At a time when everyone else had given up on search, mainly because they thought that was as good as it could possibly get and thus the future was in other ""value add"" areas such as portals and directories, Google's founders saw a way to do it better. They married multiple revolutionary innovations (page rank, commodity PCs as servers, sharded computation / ""datacenter as a system"") and combined with a little bit of usability sense they provided higher quality search results which rendered faster and at lower per result costs.<p>What they did was enter an existing market with a lot of competition and do something that the competition was absolutely incapable of matching without going back to the drawing board (there are a few other companies who do this too, the list is left as an exercise for the reader). They followed it up with new ways of advertising online that made search a money maker.",1278748517

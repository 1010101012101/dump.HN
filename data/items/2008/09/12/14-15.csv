And 1-4 hours travelling to and from work.  And 0.5-1 hours preparing and eating breakfast and dinner (I'm assuming you have lunch during your 8 hours at work).  And at least 0.5 hours showering/shaving/brushing teeth/getting dressed/etc.<p><i>focus hard enough and you can get a decent 6-8 hours for a quality coding spree at minimum</i><p>If you only need 6 hours/day of sleep and live five minutes from where you work, sure.

If you have a boring 8 hour day job, you still have <i>sixteen</i> hours left in the day. The first 8 hours may be mind-numbing and leave you exhausted and incapable of independant thought, but focus hard enough and you can get a decent 6-8 hours for a quality coding spree <i>at minimum</i>.

302423,comment,302077,302077,0,0,brandonkm,,,"After seeing this second ad in this new microsoft ad campaign i'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.  These are pretty funny and entertaining.<p>All things considered I think a lot of us are overanalyzing these ads.  This is a $300 million ad account with crispin + porter + bogusky arguably one of the best ad agencies around.  The size of this account ensures that this campaign will stretch over a year or more.  I think the overall messege they are going for is fun.  Microsoft isn't going to try to win this in the ""cool and hip"" area, so they are going for the ""fun and useful"".  After this campaign runs for awhile you may have people looking at their pcs as fun (""I can play all my games on a pc but not a mac"") and useful (""wow! pcs are everywhere, I know how to use a computer thats everywhere"").  While I myself tend to overanylyze the underlying messages with these ads, I have to remember in doing so that just yesterday my mom was talking about how funny the shoe ad was and couldn't wait to check out the new one, so for the average consumer these ads will hit their target over time.",1221230988

Here I iterate through an array in a block, assigning the current value to a local variable. Afterwards you can see that local_var remains undefind in the higher scope.<p>[norman@elis] +> irb<p>>> [1, 2, 3].each {|i| local_var = i; puts local_var}<p>1<p>2<p>3<p>=> [1, 2, 3]<p>>> puts local_var<p>NameError: undefined local variable or method `local_var'<p>for main:Object<p>from (irb):2<p>from :0<p>>><p>However unlike C-like languages, Ruby doesn't treat if/else type statements as a block.

And nobody uses Haskell to be fashionable<p>Point taken, but bear in mind that :^) indicates ironic or mischievous intent. I might as easily have said Erlang...<p>I don't participate in mailing lists but the Perl Monks have always been very helpful and patient when I've had a question, from the most basic to the more complex. The only time I got into trouble there was when I asked a question about optimizing a mailing list, and a large chunk of the audience thought I was trying to spam people. The fact that people <i>do</i> go there and ask ""hey, how can I use perl to spam people"" didn't help much... Anyway, I was eventually forgiven, with the help of a Monty Python quotation and some closely-worded arguments :)",1221230800

And nobody uses Haskell to be fashionable, it's too hard to figure out for that demographic.  The people that actually use Haskell use it because it's a good language and it's what they actually want to use.<p><i>I've known many awkward, unfriendly and arrogant people who use Perl</i><p>I wouldn't go this far -- but if you read the Perl mailing lists, you'll see that we are not lacking in the snide comment department.  Basically, it's like everything else -- the people who are smartest have very little tolerance for everyone else, and they are happy to insult you as much as possible.

It could easily cause a net increase in energy used.<p>The fundamental problem is that you don't offset anything. Offsetting would be replacing conventional energy generation with alternative, and paying for the difference in cost, not just adding more energy.<p>Your local energy provider probably has a program to do this. Call them up, and ask to spend more on energy. As they expand their generation capabilities, they do more alternatives according to your direction. That's a ""real"" offset.",1221230063

302403,story,,,30,59,jmagar,"Ask HN: What keeps you from beginning your Start Up?",,"Let's set the stage here, as I'm sure most will be expecting a nice motivating pitch about why you should quit your job.  My purpose here is to find a way to keep one of our bright young stars from doing just that.<p>He wants to execute on his planned startup, and I want to provide all the same opportunities a startup offers, within my organization, so that there is no need to look elsewhere for it. So what motivates the decision to fire your boss?  And I do believe that people don't quit their jobs, they quit their boss.  But we should not get side tracked by the ""quit your boss"" thread: his decision to do a startup was made before he was hired, and he very openly shared his plans with us and we made our offer anyway. He signed, and now the deadline he set on day one is approaching.<p>Is it the opportunity to make more money?  Possibly over a long distant event horizon, but his startup is unlikely to match the salary potential of the next two to three years.<p>Is it ownership / equity?  Stock options are available, thus it is possible to use this incentive to  keep him within our engineering team.<p>Is it responsibility?  His career path can include that too, and I'd be happy to start transferring more  on to his shoulders.<p>Is it influence, decision making, and direction setting?  Well, we kinda fall down there.  Many cooks in this kitchen, and most have greater influence than is available to him.  His voice is heard of course, and great ideas are easy to spot no matter who they come from, but if he expects his voice to win out every time I can't provide any assurances that it will be so.<p>Have I missed anything?<p>Let's not forget the other things that corporate life provides that Start Ups simply can't compete against:  we've got cash which means all your standard developer care and feeding: snacks, beverages, free lunches.  With cash comes profit sharing, job security, benefits, paid vacations, etc.  We've got lots of people in the office too and that adds to your daily life experiences:  co-workers become friends become family. And he's got me, and many others, as advocates within the company trying to show that we are invested in his career and will support him no matter which path he chooses.",1221229651

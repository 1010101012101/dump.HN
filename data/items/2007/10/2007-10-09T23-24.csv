GA's JavaScript snippet in fact returns to Google more and more pertinent information than is resident in the average web server log file. Plus it removes the spiders and non-page view data just by <i>being</i> a JavaScript-based tracking solution so that's less work and cleaner data for them (and anyone else who does this e.g. all of the other Web analytics vendors).",1191974002
65550,comment,65508,65544,0,0,codeslinger,,,"I think it would be less bandwidth. Considering the overhead of all the individual HTTP headers both in request and response, you could reduce that significantly by batching up log files and uploading them at regular intervals, perhaps once a day? GA seems to perform batch updates at that interval in any case so it might not even put a big cramp in their style from that perspective.<p>However, there are a bunch more issues with this. To allow this, they'd have to be able to parse all of the most popular Web server log formats. This, in and of itself, is not that hard until you account for people customizing their logging format via measures like the LogFormat directive in Apache. As well, customizing the log format is a virtual necessity, as GA requires more information than is in the standard log formats of most web servers. Another issue is that the use of a JavaScript snippet on the page prevents non-browser user agents from appearing, clearing GA's logs of spiders and other such cruft that detracts from determining human user behavior (what they are apparently most interested in for the purposes of optimizing AdWords and AdSense).<p>But the biggest problem for them, I think, is that with this method they are no longer able to set first-party cookies on your user's browsers and thus (more) reliably track individual (read: human) users. So, in effect, they would waste time with this, in that they'd still have to make you put a JS snippet on the page to set cookies that you'd then have to modify your web server logging format to include in every hit. Urchin worked like this back when it was still alive and you could run it on your own servers. So, all in all, it seems like something Google would just be wasting their time in doing given what they want to get out of your data.",1191973800

> was a really bad position for a tiny startup to be in ...<p>Well, the question is:  ""Who is un(der)serviced in this market?""  If the public schools are bad, it is probably the parents and students.  I don't know much about your product, but one approach might be to see how it can be sold to parents who want to improve their children's education.",1191972477

They usually get a reply from disabled@facebook explaining why they were banned within a few hours. Perhaps email again? Be sure to be poilte and apologetic, they sometimes will reinstate your account if they're in a good mood.",1191971993

I just have a hard time seeing TDD in all cases. As one commenter pointed out, some systems evolve and some are specified. Evolving systems have execution units (classes, modules, etc) that can change a heckuva lot. Specified systems don't. On a specified system, you know within 80% or so what your hunks of stuff are. <p>
Now I've coded a lot of specified systems. No, you don't design every little detail, that's not what I'm saying. But if you're writing code to balance a checkbook you're not going to end up with a program to make spaghetti. In the startup world, you very well could end up somewhere in a completely different problem domain. Whatever happens, I wouldn't want the testing structure to get in the way of the best design, simply by making it so hard t do heavy refactoring.",1191970999

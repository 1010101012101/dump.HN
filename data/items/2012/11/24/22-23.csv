4826725,comment,4826561,4826658,18,0,Camillo,,,"I don't think it's hard for men, frankly - I think it's a bit too easy for women. Our culture has really become too carefree about showing off sex toys - but only for women, it seems. Compare the mental image of a woman accidentally dropping a  dildo or a vibrator out of her purse, and that of a man dropping a rubber vagina out of his bag.<p>But there's a problem beyond the double standard. It's like public nudity: it sounds cool when you're a hormone-addled teenager, but then you realize that most people's bodies aren't a nice sight at all. That's why I'm thankful for common decency, and why I'm concerned about all the public dildo-waving: in most cases, I don't want to see your filthy body, and I certainly don't want to picture you having sex.<p>Of course, I have no problem with this blog post - but the ""openness"" that's bothering some of these posters does have the potential to impinge on my rights of peaceful enjoyment of our public meatspace.",1353797868

Someone gets sick. You are in an arms race with a well-funded competitor.<p>Something I would like the programming world to discuss is that it isn't the best coded product that wins - technical quality rarely matters. Usually, the first product to market wins, or the programmer who kicks out the most features as long as the features works. Shipping isn't just a feature. It is the only code quality metric that matters to anyone who isn't a coder. It also is easier to ask forgiveness for refactoring after the ship date than it is to ask for permission to push the date back. All-nighters are ingrained in the practice of programming for a living.

The biggest advantage of an S-corp is the ability to save on the payroll taxes that the employer has to pay. But that really depends on how much you make, how much you take in salary/W-2 etc. But again, there are other costs of running an S-corp that add up really fast. For example, the accounting and taxes are much more complicated for S-corps and you certainly need a good CPA for it.<p>I suggest you talk to at least 2-3 CPAs and get an idea. Even the CPAs differ in their understanding and preferences. My CPA insists that S-corp is good for me while another one I spoke to kept telling me to switch to LLC.<p>In general, you need to consider the following factors:<p>1. Social security tax portion of employer. This has a cap at about 110K i think in 2012. So any income over that, does not matter anyway. FOr 2012, the rate was 6.2%. lets say you earned 100K but only paid yourself 75K with S-corp. At a high level, you will save almost 2K in ss taxes portion of the employer.<p>2. Medicare tax portion of the employer. This one is huge since there is no cap. So the less you pay in salary, more you save in tax.",1353796280

Two years ago when people said HTML5 wasn't ready for prime time they were talking about audio and video tags, canvas, SVG, CSS media queries, and websockets (which, by the way, are pretty usable with a shim like socket.io or sockJS). Now those things are all more or less feasible across browsers with some (or a lot) of JS (localStorage and the app cache can also be used as long as they're not relied on, which is a reasonable long term strategy for most web apps anyway) but web workers and webgl have picked up steam since then. If we keep moving the HTML5 goalpost (I've given up on paying attention to the spec), it will never be ready for production use.<p>I guess I'm only saying this because the HTML5 brand has created enormous confusion in the marketplace. That's largely because it was touted as ""the replacement for Flash"" and my point is that it is already quite capable of doing that in most cases.",1353795262

Hardly.  People are leveraging themselves to afford bigger houses than their parents had.  According to the National Association of Home Builders [0], average new house size was 1400 sq ft in 1970 and 2700 sq ft in 2009.  You can find similar data from the census bureau's American Housing Survey [1].

However, the invisible hand of the market do provides incentives for doctors willing to do that job!<p>The reason is the difference in financial gain if for some reason (domain knowledge) a doctor can perform the same job more efficiently - which is usually the case in medical coding, where a doctor usually know better which complications are linked with which diseases, and which procedures must have been performed and thus, if they don't appear, have usually been done but for some reason the coding didn't happen.<p>That's just 2 quick examples - a physician can ""dig"" in the file for supporting evidence to back the claim. Some are quite good at it, and with the numbers at hand, tiny differences in productivity make huge financial gains.<p>Say that worker 1, anyone with good training, can make 2x returns, while worker 2, a doctor, can make 2.2x returns.<p>Depending on the volume, you hire both and give the common files to worker 1, and big profile cases to worker 2.<p>Each worker is usually paid at the marginal value of labor.<p>When the marginal value of billing improvements become greater than the marginal value of clinical care, labor <i>do</i> arbitrage and moves to the higher paying sector - in this case, doctors are going for clinical practice to billing.<p>Someone with basic training - or even algorithm - can be efficient, and provide a first line of coding. But domain knowledge still rules and brings in big bucks.<p>Trust me - my job is to bill patients/insurance as much as we are legally allowed to, using any mean necessary, in a way that will stand in court if challenged.<p>We're long past data-mining for potential missing codes - we now run simulations to isolate which coding is the most probable and the most lucrative, and divert the file to the right person according to the potential financial gains. Any loophole in the coding rules is exploited big time !<p>A quick example - several years ago there was no consequence if you ""forgot"" codes, however simulations figured out in 10% of the case this resulted in greater gains.<p>Consequently, after a matching legal advice, codes were forgotten 10% of the time - of course, the <i>right</i> times, until forgetting code was disincentivized thought legal changes.",1353795035

They did it to ""study real users"" and get feedback on the gnome3 UI.<p>Some background: we were representing ~500+ Real Paying Gnome Users, not some nebulous fantasy persona that gnome hopes to get as a user in the future.  We are the real customers.  We are high-end computer graphics researchers, software developers, and some of the most talented CG artists in the world.<p>We are content <i>creators</i>, not content consumers.<p>My gut feeling after the meeting was that they were so stuck  in their decisions that they really didn't care about the feedback we had for them.  They spent their time defending their positions with platitudes like, ""well, you have to try it first.  Maybe it's not that bad"".<p>No one liked the magic hot-corner activities window.  That's not how we work.  The gnome3 philosophy seems to be centered around single applications that consume the entire window, and no configuration.  Our workflow is having lots of separate terminals, windows, and a mix of applications running at once.  Our world views are drastically different.<p>My simple question, ""if you move the menu bar to the top, and we all use sloppy-focus, doesn't that mean that if there's a window in-between the active window and the top of the screen that we'll lose focus as we try to move the mouse up to the top menubar?"", was met with, ""well, we didn't think that through.  Yes, there might be problems with sloppy focus.  <silence>"".  Uggh.<p>It's gotten to the point where we are afraid of what's going to happen when RHEL7 comes around and gnome3 is the default.  We are paying customers and we don't want gnome3.<p>I love everything redhat does for the community, but I can't help but get a sense that they are cannibalizing their current users in hope of gaining some nebulous lowest-common-denominator user in exchange.<p>I really don't know what's going to happen, but XFCE looks like a serious alternative now.  What if redhat won't support us if we use XFCE on the desktop?  Well, we might have to search for a competitor.  Who's the competition?  Who's target customer is the high-end Linux desktop user?

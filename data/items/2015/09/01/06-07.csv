Mainly because we are so good at fooling ourselves and our thought processes are so full of errors that I&#x27;m highly skeptical of the &quot;truth&quot; value of any thought process that does not perform stringent reality checks from experimental data or mathematics.<p>Then again, to find new interesting points of view mind should be given the capability to flow freely - but to actually utilize those fantasies in finding new truths requires also hard labor.",1441090737

When the kernel gets confused and says both drives are corrupted simultaneously, it&#x27;s easy to manually repair with dd.  (See which block has unrecoverable errors and copy that one over from your other drive.  Repaired.  Not sure why the kernel can&#x27;t do this automatically.  The data is gone, you can&#x27;t make it worse.)<p>For datacenter applications, having everything on one machine behind a filesystem abstraction seems like unnecessary complexity, not to mention a single point of failure and a waste of resources.  I&#x27;d much rather handle things on the application level; if I want three copies of my data around, write it to three different machines with disks.  When a copy seems unavailable, make an extra to keep the redundancy level the same across disk failures.  If I want some redundancy encoding, just store that instead of the raw file.  Now there is no complicated recovery when your disk fails.  The system is always in a recovered state because disk failures are expected and uneventful.<p>That said, there is a bit of complexity in implementing this, and even more complexity when you want all the pleasantries of a UNIX filesystem (permissions, quota, etc.).  I know of only one working implementation of this technique, and it&#x27;s not open source.  And, of course, if you&#x27;re going to use existing software rather than writing your own, you&#x27;re going to need a UNIX filesystem for it to use, not some clever chunk storage manager you wrote.  So btrfs and zfs persist.",1441090703

10151043,comment,10150807,10150981,0,0,schoen,,,"I don&#x27;t think this guide is written by a fundamentally cryptographically well-informed person (edit: despite being by a great PL theory expert). At the cosmetic level, it calls AES the &quot;Advance Encryption standard&quot; and says RSA was invented by &quot;Don Rivest&quot;.<p>OK, maybe these are typos in an early draft. But then it tells you that &quot;the problem&quot; with a LCG stream cipher with a 32-bit internal state &quot;is that if we encrypt the same text many times with the same password the encrypted text is always the same&quot; and that appending a random string to the password will &quot;remedy this&quot; (implying that this fix has made the stream cipher secure!). No, &quot;the problem&quot; with this LCG is that its effective key space is 32 bits and you can brute force it with 2³² trial decryption operations without even doing any algebra.<p>The text supplies an AES implementation that uses MD5 as a KDF, it supplies sample stream cipher code that uses RC4, it also goes on to recommend SHA-1 and says that &quot;In practice I usually encrypt something like an SHA1 checksum (160 bits) with a 800 bit [RSA] key. 800 bits is fast enough for me and sufficiently difficult to crack that for most purposes can be considered secure.&quot;<p>(Hint: expert advice urged phasing out keys of that length by around the year 2000, and an academic group publicly announced breaking a 768-bit key back in 2009. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-768"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers#RSA-768</a>  ... which the author even knows about because it is mentioned in footnote 14!)<p>More than a decade ago there had already been &quot;20 years of attacks against the RSA cryptosystem&quot;.<p><a href=""https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/RSA-survey.pdf</a><p>Do you understand these attacks? Do you know about the next decade of attacks that followed them? If not, you shouldn&#x27;t be implementing the RSA code that you&#x27;re going to use in production! (Let me emphasize that I don&#x27;t understand all of these attacks, which is why I don&#x27;t try to implement the RSA code that I use in production.)<p>The tutorial even criticizes some of its own recommendations (on p. 45). If it&#x27;s really oriented toward teaching people crypto that they&#x27;re supposed to use in deployed systems -- which I see plenty of indications of -- this is kind of a menace. Like a section on &quot;Curing Cancer&quot; that says &quot;People cure cancer with powdered rhinoceros horns&quot;, then 20 pages later &quot;Note: I know doctors don&#x27;t actually think rhinoceros horns can cure cancer&quot;.<p>I really like crypto education that helps people understand the big ideas and what&#x27;s going on behind the scenes. I think it&#x27;s great for people to get the opportunity to get to see how their crypto works. This guide could be that, if only it made clear that its advice and examples are NOT SAFE TO USE IN PRODUCTION and that you should use implementations developed and reviewed by experts. The author does not seem to have that point of view, instead saying &quot;[coding it yourself from scratch] is possible for algorithms such as RSA, where the core RSA algorithm can be coded in a handful of lines of code. This fits in with my philosophy of programming. I think it is better to completely understand RSA implemented using Erlang bignums, rather than not understand a fast RSA algorithm written in thousands of lines of assembler and using hardware acceleration which I cannot myself validate.&quot;",1441090443

It has <i>never</i> been about the &#x27;expense&#x27;. People without property, blacks, women, etc. were not prevented from voting because it wasn&#x27;t cheap enough or because they were too dumb (not that that excuse wasn&#x27;t used frequently).<p>Democratic reforms do not happen when everybody comes together to agree that they are a sensible next step. They happen when the masses fight and sacrifice with blood, sweat and sometimes their lives.<p>Our representatives aren&#x27;t experts in foreign policy or economics or other relevant policy matters either (series of tubes, anyone?). They rely upon advisors. This is another source of unchecked power and privilege (particularly for the economics profession, which abuses this power ruthlessly and are often no more competent at running an economy than the average person).<p>Direct democracy is not available to us today because we didn&#x27;t fight  for it. It has nothing to do with technology. It has to do with a lack of activism (the kind which involves real work).<p>As a society we&#x27;re actually steadily de-democratizing and moving towards a more feudalistic model where the decisions are largely made by legions of unelected financiers, elite economists and a corporate elite.",1441090270

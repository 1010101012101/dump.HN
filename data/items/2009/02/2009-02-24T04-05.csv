You're of course completely correct; I can remove history by using ""svnadmin dump"", or editing the RCS files backing CVS, or probably hacking Perforce's BDB file manually.  But that's not part of the default workflow, whereas ""git rebase -i"" seems to be an important part of the daily git workflow.  It's not a throwaway distinction, and has real implications.",1235451545

492669,comment,491923,492479,0,0,gecko,,,"> So, set it to ten years, and lose nothing of interest... Does that answer your objection?<p>No.  It's still lossy.  To turn the question around: if Subversion expired changesets after a given length of time, I think you would complain.  Likewise, if git expired mainline commits after a certain length of time, you would also complain (I sure hope).  git is lossy, and I happen to think that's entirely the wrong thing for a VCS to be.  Making it ""less"" lossy is kind of like trying to keep your teenage daughter ""less"" pregnant.<p>> You could do that with git now.  [Lengthy explanation follows]<p>I can also do that right now in Mercurial using the group extension (<a href=""http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/GroupExtension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/GroupExtensi...</a>), which is possible because Mercurial, being written in Python, is trivial to extend.  But that's not the same as being part of the Mercurial workflow, any more than the bookmark extension in Mercurial prior to hg 1.1 counted as a real answer to git topic branches, or Loom counts as bzr's answer to Mercurial's mq now: it's not part of the VCS.  Yes, I can make these all work however I wish--but as much as people have now forgotten, it's also relatively easy to make CVS and Subversion work in similar ways through tools such as Quilt (<a href=""http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt</a>), which allow for rebasing, offline commits, and many other features that you think of as git/hg/bzr-specific.  We've abandoned those tools for good reasons: they required extensions, shell scripts, and odd workflows to work in distributed environments.  We will do the same to our existing VCSes unless they can approach a more ideal workflow.",1235451378

When they showed me graphs of how much money I made them and didn't even bother with a Christmas bonus I quit.

I only lasted 9 months at the first job and 6 months at the second. I'm on my third job now (thankfully I like this one so I'll be here hopefully for a while) and I graduated less than 2 years ago.

Why make it negative?  ""ADHD"" sounds like ""a disease that needs to be treated"".  Hyperbrain sounds like ""the personality of some very smart and productive people"".  So there's really no need to use terminology that immediately taints the personality as being negative.  (Plus, the target audience will probably get upset and get distracted by something else.)<p>There is no reason to consider your personality a disease that needs treating, but it is also not bad to learn how to exploit it effectively.  That's the point of the article, and the terminology used appeals to the ""target market"".<p>Anyway, this is pretty much exactly my personality.  I consider myself pretty productive (look at my GitHub page, more than a few projects there), but I am very easily distracted from things I don't want to do.  The key is to not let yourself be distracted by stupidity (Reddit was my problem), and instead let yourself be distracted by things that are going to be useful.  Other programming tasks, answering people's questions on StackOverflow or mailing lists, etc.  If you aren't going to get any work done, at least get <i>something valuable</i> done.<p>I should really stop reading news.yc, though, because I waste too much time here.

I do agree that many of those things that people use to diagnose arrogance might actually indicate steadfastness, confidence, straightforward honesty or some other mostly positive attribute.

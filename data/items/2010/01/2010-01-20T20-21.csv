1065766,comment,1063485,1063485,0,0,dkimball,,,"I've read the book about this: _War and Peace and War: The Rise and Fall of Empires_, by Peter Turchin. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Rise-Fall-Empires/dp/0452288193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1264020585&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Rise-Fall-Empires/dp/0452288...</a> )<p>Turchin's model of asabiya is much more developed than the article's, but goes in exactly the same direction. He emphasizes the importance of frontiers and warfare -- the civilizational counterpart to Darwinian selection pressure, and a reminder that there are worse enemies than one's neighbor and higher causes than one's checkbook -- for asabiya development and, thus, the cohesion of societies. All this is borne out with some very impressive styles of measurement; he's the founder of a new discipline called ""cliodynamics,"" taking its approaches from ecological population modeling.<p>On the other hand, before we embrace war as the road to prosperity, we need to remember what commentors here observed -- that most civilizations wage war lawlessly, to the point of torture and genocide; so some sort of authority to control the intensity and severity of warfare would be a good idea. I don't think the United Nations will cut it; but Chesterton thought that the Pope would have, had the medieval project been taken to its conclusion...",1264021134

I am getting annoyed with Google junk results.

People who are committed to being ""better than"" in any way would never post something as cliché and tasteless as a Myspace pose.  Honestly, for the long term I'm looking for someone whose snob standards are sufficiently aligned with mine, but sometimes it's nice to go out with someone with no standards.

A company has a quota (usually annual) for how much can be sent out of China and the banks have records of your company's quota usage.  There are deals to be made.  If you're bringing in $X million USD to invest in China, you may be able to get the government to set your quota to that of your original investment or higher.  This is negotiable to some extent.  But the overall purpose is to lock in some or all of your gains so your choices are aligned to investing in China (real estate, stock market, other China companies, etc).<p>Similar system for personal gains.  If your a foreigner working in China your supposed to be paid by the local company which means through their local bank accounts which can only pay to your local bank account (usually only to the same bank).  If I recall correct, your default quota per year is $50K USD (or is that RMB? I never hit either limit).  So if your making $200K a year in China and are not blowing all that on housing and having a grand time, your limited to only being able to send $50K a year out.  Some get around this (as well as taxes) by paying their foreign employees through an international entity and then the employee bring in the cash he needs on a regular basis.  But this practice is deteriorating as China is becoming better at policing payroll of foreigners working in China.",1264019572

You make some good points about the perfect and complete lighting.<p>I've been lucky enough to spend time with wildlife photographers in the field. As far as I can tell they spend almost all their time creating and waiting for perfect opportunities. We spent time scouting out locations and doing test shoots to figure out what would work in that location. Looking at different angles so the background and lighting at that time of day was ideal. It also quickly became my understanding that professional wildlife photographers have a crazy knack for choosing appropriate settings (exposures lighting etc). Since opportunities are so rare and perfect moments fleeting... I guess that makes sense. All of that being said I don't remember any actual photos being taken at night. At dawn and sunset, almost always.<p>I have also been in the field with a guy who took his own photographs for a national geographic article. It was a wildlife and nature article not human interest. For his one article he took 50000+ shots. Then national geographic would use approximately 10-20 shots. This was back when digital was still gimmicky and professionals were using slide film. So they were developing 1500 rolls of slide film... this all seems so crazy now-a-days.<p>I'd be interested in how many photos people take now. Having to remove the film and put in new roll cold kill a wildlife shot. So you were often limited to 36 shots. The cameras used to create a horrid sound loading new film - the nicer the camera the louder and more obnoxious the sound.

I saw a post here not too long ago (i wish i could find a link). Its pretty handy. You can start a wave, and start threads and build off of it.<p>Another tool ive tinkered around with was mindmapping tools. There are a few out there where you can share and collaborate mindmaps. I really liked the UX www.mindmeister.com. Check it out!",1264018315

Media coverage of disasters enables the world at large to understand what's going on and act in order to help those affected. How many readers have donated money in the past week to Haiti relief? By comparison, how many donated money in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, which killed upwards of 140,000 people in Burma in May 2008, but received far less global media coverage, owing to press resitrctions in the country?<p>One other thing to consider about the press coverage of Haiti, and other disasters: The stress on the journalists covering death and destruction can actually trigger PTSD. The Nieman report just had an entire issue devoted to stress and other issues experienced by journalists covering traumatic events or interviewing the victims of disasters and crimes.

They are designed around providing a simple user experience, and all the consumer needs is familiarity.<p>Plugging in a computer is another matter though.  There's a mental barrier there that people will just never overcome.  Computers are complicated, and people use them for other things (okay maybe only web surfing and email).  They don't want to plug it in and start a program, no matter how simple it is.  Even if the program was henceforth telepathic and let you watch any content instantaneously in HD it would be a hard sell.<p>Dedicated boxes are the way this will go.",1264017631

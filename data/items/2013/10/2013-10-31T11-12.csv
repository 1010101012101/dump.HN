6646277,comment,6645009,6645105,2,0,Theodores,,,"This all began in the 1970&#x27;s when National Semiconductor brought out a series of integrated circuits for alarm clocks, clock radios, clocks for cars and so on. These chips included the LED display driver and the timing clock usually came from the mains.<p>Here is an example with the page of the data sheet regarding how the snooze function works:<p><a href=""http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/9252/NSC/MM5387AA/168/4/MM5387AA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/9252/NSC/MM5387AA/168/...</a><p>When the alarm goes there is a &#x27;latch&#x27; that is operational for 59 minutes. Pressing snooze does not turn this &#x27;latch&#x27; off, it suppresses the alarm output for 8-9 minutes. Turning the alarm off is what resets the &#x27;latch&#x27;.<p>Chips of this era worked on BCD - BCD ruled once upon a time, when people did things in FORTRAN...<p>I don&#x27;t think that National Semiconductor deliberately sought to emulate the snooze time of analog alarms from a previous era, it just was do-able to do 8-9 minutes in available silicon.",1383220702

You gain experience and stability through working for other agencies and companies, in this time you work on your own plans, save your own financing and ease into your own business at a period when self-sufficiency blooms from your and your staffs productivity.<p>I&#x27;m currently at this phase, I wouldn&#x27;t quit my job and request state handouts because there&#x27;s no saying that my idea for a business would work and it would be forcing other tax payers to accept the risk. So in other words, the inherent risks which come with entrepreneurship would be placed on the tax payer.<p>This would also mean people would take more careless business risks. This is similar to why bank bailout made banks less accountable, I think there needs to be a greater separation between state and economy ultimately.<p>Government subsidies also distort the true market value of services, for example in the U.S. if you invest in a government lobbied program, you can see in the region of 200%+ profit returns, whereas the most wealthiest returns for non-state backed industries are more like 7-10% profit returns. This leads to bubbles, inflation and would automatically mean a higher tax burden for tax payers.<p>You&#x27;re definitely correct that something needs to happen to make it easier for start-ups, I would argue though perhaps a tax relief for start-ups once they are up and running, or a reduction in regulation to make it easier to get going.

Hospitals already do this for patients with hypo/hyperthermia. This could be monitored/regulated with a second band worn on the upper arm near the armpit which measures body temperature directly.<p>The question is more one of how much of an actual change can they impart (and under what circumstances?) given the size limitations of something like a wrist strap. My hunch is that this would need to be a fairly large system (including its power source) to have a meaningful impact outside of sedentary activity in an environment which is mildly under/over temperature. So good news for people who get chilly working long hours in their cold offices (which is a completely viable market), but not for runners looking to shed gear. Maybe there&#x27;s something there for cyclists though, but only if they&#x27;re willing to put up with a wheel generator.<p>Also, humidity impacts comfort largely because of its impact evaporation rates.

But you have to pay into insurance first. Payment is deducted automatically by payroll tax.<p>- Hartz IV offers Euro350+housing per month, if you are available for the job market.<p>Now for entrepreneurs Germany offers a Gruendungszuschuss. Thats 60% of the former income + Euro300 for half a year longer then Arbeitslosengeld. Unlike Arbeitslosengeld its completely tax free, and nearly without requirement.<p>Health, unemployment, and retirement insurance for self employed are voluntary. Most self employed take health insurance, and omit the the other two.<p>Last not least its possible to go to Hartz IV as a self employment. This is a pain in the ass, as one has to show them your books every month, to get the difference between income an Hartz IV money.<p>Now the drawbacks. Health insurance for self employed assumes that you at least earn Euro2000, and charges 15% = Euro300 per month minimum. They will charge more, if you earn more, but wont cache back, if you earned less.<p>Most entrepreneurs don&#x27;t have retirement insurance, because its to expensive when you start your business, and once you lack retirement insurance by being unemployed or self employed, the payout is less then Hartz IV.

6646193,comment,6642222,6643506,1,0,simonh,,,"Agreed, it&#x27;s bunk. The reason you have modular designs is precisely because some parts aren&#x27;t good enough so you need to be able to swap in better ones. When all the parts are good enough, and are going to stay good enough, modularity offers insufficient advantages.<p>The thing with software is that you can have your cake and eat it. App platforms are intrinsically modular - every app is a little module of functionality. Looked at that way, the Apple ecosystem is staggeringly modular, with hundreds of thousands of modules available from many thousands of developers.<p>It&#x27;s possible what Christensen means by modularity is really commoditisation. The idea that eventually base operating systems will be so mature and stable that it won&#x27;t matter which one you&#x27;re running, so there will be no reason to pay a premium for a proprietary system. I don&#x27;t think that will ever be true. Human society, fashion, behaviour and needs are too dynamic and advancing too fast. OS and platform development has been going at breakneck speed for the entire history of computing and shows no signs of slowing down. Apple apparently &#x27;lost&#x27; the PC wars because modular commoditised modular windows ate it&#x27;s lunch. Yet now we live in a world where innovative mobile OSes, have totally redefined the computing experience and in the form of the iPad is chewing a great big hole back into the established computing market. The truth is that OSes were never commoditised and just good enough. It just looked that way because the stagnation of the dominant platform was misread as being stability.",1383219370

Outright banning all such devices limits this possibility.<p>I really wish the direct approach to the law could work so that this technology could evolve at its normal pace. What&#x27;s the issue we&#x27;re trying to solve? Unnecessary injury/property damage due to distracted driving. What should the law be? Enforce a severe punishment for drivers who cause personal injury or property damage while driving distracted. Oh, you were typing a text message when you ran over that pedestrian? Well we&#x27;re going to drain your personal assets first, perhaps garnish your wages, and then if and only if those assets don&#x27;t cover the damages your insurance will start to kick in. Oh, the pedestrian died due to your provable distractedness? You&#x27;re going to prison.<p>But again, I realize that&#x27;s very ideal and won&#x27;t work in the real world. Negligence doesn&#x27;t respond to punishment in the same way as crimes which require the perpetrator to make an active decision to forego their morals. Negligence is by definition passive. It&#x27;s the act of not doing. You could argue that device-induce distracted driving is a more active form of negligence, but the psychology behind the way beeps and buzzes control our lives is weird. Want to cut ahead of a long line when all you need to do is ask someone a question? Look up the phone number for the person sitting behind the desk and call them.

It&#x27;s not refactoring if you just randomly decide to modify a single function&#x27;s signature and then don&#x27;t follow up and fix the rest of the code.<p>> Other coders who are also working inside the same module/API boundary will have their edits broken by this change. The original developer cannot fix their code because it&#x27;s not checked in yet.<p>Not if you&#x27;re making small commits, often. Changing a function signature necessitates the modification of all callers to that function. This would be a large commit which includes all of necessary changes to ensure that the software remains in a stable state.<p>> I already explained why they can&#x27;t follow up - because the code that needs the follow up is in their codevelopers&#x27; working trees. Flagging here would be silly. Almost every single commit would be &quot;flagged for fixing breakage&quot;, since every single commit can refactor/change internal function signatures.<p>This is still just a process problem - if you committed and merged more often, these issues wouldn&#x27;t arise. The reason you&#x27;re having these issues is because you&#x27;re allowing your working trees to become too out of sync. If everybody is working on the same module, then those developers should be trying to retain lock-step. Even if developer A (the breaker) doesn&#x27;t have access to the code of developer B and therefore can&#x27;t update his function calls - committing smaller changesets and merging more often, where the overhead in assessing changes is tiny, will wipe out 99% of these issues. If you can&#x27;t see the forest for the trees, then issues are going to slip through.<p>> Yes, and we are all human so sometimes, despite heroic efforts, we will all make stupid mistakes as well as subtle mistakes.
Now, once we made the mistake, do we want our tool to insidiously hide this mistake from us, making it as expensive as possible to punish us for our mistake? Or do we want a tool that tells me ASAP &quot;Hey dude, you made a stupid mistake over there&quot;?<p>Except in JS, the code itself isn&#x27;t a mistake. It&#x27;s <i>your</i> problem - JS has nothing to do with ensuring that you keep your codebase bug-free.<p>> And to do this job, I have tools like languages that help me find those mistakes quickly.<p>Then use them, and stop complaining about something that you don&#x27;t even use.<p>> Making mistakes isn&#x27;t &quot;sloppiness&quot;, it&#x27;s human.<p>Making the same mistake repeatedly and then blaming your tools is sloppiness however you dress it up.<p>> If one language makes writing a non-shitty codebase harder than a different language, it is also the fault of that language.<p>It&#x27;s not harder, it&#x27;s just different.

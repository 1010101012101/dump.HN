204089,comment,203804,203804,0,0,wataguy,,,"Living in the developing world, as I do, net connections can be pretty flaky and certainly far from ubiquitous. As a result, things work much better for me if I can grab feeds when I have a connection and then read them offline. For me, partial feeds are a pain in the ass; give me a full feed every time. And no, I don't mind ads in my feeds.",1212126690

He says he only uses about 5% of what he comes up with. Coming up with a lot of crap is a recurring trend for many successful creative types, but you only hear about the 5% that isn't crap.",1212125913

You are a very talented writer, you can really capture the emotion though your words..<p>I go to college too and there have been some times where I felt the same way.. The best thing to do is to get involved with something you are interested in and meet people through there. Use events or activities as a medium to get closer to interesting people, its one thing that has really worked for me.<p>People are naturally social creatures, its probably hard but force yourself to go out and meet people. The best way to start a conversation is just to say hi. Yea you will probably get rejected by 90% of the people you meet but keep at it and the 10% will more than make up for all of those failures.<p>Also if you want to talk feel free to email me at chris.r.mccann [at] gmail.com I'd be happy to talk",1212125379

There's this very strange dynamic of party-going OSU students, diverse foreign-exchange OSU students, sports-crazy Ohioans, business-minded corporate-types, and aesthetic art aficionados.<p>Maybe, most of all, the message of Columbus is that diversity is good.",1212125352

If this passes, there's a good chance that highly qualified applicants won't have quite as long a wait in the future.<p>Another option, of course, is just to send in the application and let the government chew on it while you go somewhere else for a year or two.",1212124910

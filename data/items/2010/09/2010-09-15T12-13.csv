To me, having many (hopefully low cost) interviews simply allows software developers to be efficiently priced as market conditions change.<p>Now, the natural response, if employee value can move <i>upward</i> more easily, is that employers will be less willing to offer job/salary security.  But, on average, this is good, right?

1694046,comment,1693298,1693298,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The problem with doing this analysis of a bunch of college students at top-tier colleges is that there’s a big selection bias. My guess (from having spent four years as a Harvard student and talking to many of them) is that, statistically, the kids who manage to get into a school like Harvard while having low latent inhibition probably need to have something else working for them to compensate for that.<p>In other words, the types of people who get in can be (as a model, remember; this is far from completely accurate) classified along two dimensions, let’s call them A and B, where:<p>+A = Great latent inhibition. Able to focus and work really diligently on some assigned task.<p>-A = Less latent inhibition. Some probably ADHD. Less able to focus diligently because they get distracted more easily.<p>+B = Really ""creative""/bright/clever/smart/""rich mixture of thoughts"". Think ""high IQ"" here, though there are a bunch of correlated dimensions here that can’t ideally sort people. Better description might be ""paying close attention to the world"" or ""picks up new things quickly"".<p>-B = Less ""creative""/bright/clever/smart/whatever<p>Okay, so think about who gets into a place like Harvard. I posit that you end up with some +A+B types, some +A-B types, some -A+B types, and a lot less -A-B types.<p>In other words, to get into Harvard you’d better be a hard worker, or pretty sharp, or both, but if you’re neither you’ll have some trouble.<p>So now, what does this study actually do? It splits up the population into two groups, +A and -A, and then tries to find a correlation between that and +B/-B.<p>Well, in the first group we have +A+Bs and +A-Bs, while in the second group we only have the -A+Bs (the -A-Bs having already been excluded by the admissions criteria)<p>Then the study (or at least the Wired write-up) turns this into a causal link between -A and +B.... well, count me at least skeptical. I know some really really smart people who are also able to focus really well. Which is not to say that there certainly isn’t some other relationship between these two dimensions, but only that a study like this doesn’t seem like ""proof"".  If we imagine these dimensions as normally distributed and independent, where you need some cut-off sum of A + B to get into a selective college, the number of students falling at the far right end of both bell curves (the +A+B bunch) at once might be really small.",1284554832

Many albums (especially from independent labels) are only added months after release, if at all. Some titles are removed after a while for apparently no reason (I'm still pissed off that Psychic Chasms from Neon Indian was removed as it is one of the best albums of 2009).<p>* The iPhone app simply sucks. Sure it looks nice, but dear lord it eats a lot of battery. On my iPhone 4, listening to Spotify during my morning commute consumes about 20% of the battery as opposed to <1% of the iPod app. This is simply unacceptable. I guess this must have something to do with Spotify not being able to use hardware decoding as it uses Ogg Vorbis, not MP3 or AAC.<p>* The 3 devices limit for offline tracks is not enough. I've got a work desktop, a home desktop, a notebook, an iPhone and an iPad. That's 5.

They help them pirate it.<p>Pirating software is often a pain - find a proper release, install, replace a binary, generate a key, avoid online services, seek out cracked updates (or go without them). If your time has value, it's hardly free. Do you really think everyone pirating anything is going through this process for every Tom, Dick and Harry they know, as opposed to just saying, ""Yeah, it's $50 at Gamestop...""?<p>What the author is talking about sounds like the far more common scenario -- friends will see a pirated game being played (or just hear it being praised), and make a purchase later if they so desire (perhaps on services like Steam, where hordes of people who used to exclusive pirate games now periodically pay for the simple conveniences of being legit).  And the pirates themselves are occasionally 'turned' by the kind of value-adds that the author is taking about. How many people who <i>really</i> liked the single-player modes in their pirate copy of MW2 didn't go legit so that they could play multiplayer?<p>Piracy can unquestionably lead to expanded mindshare and buzz, it's silly to assert that it merely spawns more piracy.

Forget about the TAOCP, it really is overrated. Cormen is more recent and to the point. But don't read it cover to cover, but consult it when you need it. Furthermore, read the Dragon book (first one is enough) on compiler construction. Finally, learn to program in Standard ML, for example via the book by Larry Paulson (ML for the working programmer). That should be enough for the basic theory. If you got the above stuff under your belt, then this will take you pretty far.

1693995,comment,1690789,1693237,0,0,mseebach,,,"The reason local rates in Europe are so low is not regulation of the rates, it's regulation of the carriers, forcing them to open up the networks they build subsidized to competitors basically at cost, in part through mobile virtual network operator agreements. This removes the barrier to entry, I think in Denmark starting a MVNO takes a deposit on the scale of $8-10.000.<p>This is also reflected in the outrageous prices for roaming - this market is not opened up.<p>I suspect the case in the US is that the carriers aren't forced to open up in the same way.<p>But, the essence of my disagreement with the GPs post is the idea that entering a two-year contract to get a subsidized phone is ""customer-slavery"", ""clearly"" in need of regulation. Just get an unlocked phone and a monthly/pay-go plan. (Putting an APR on the contract I could get behind, though).<p>I've done that, and with my actual usage pattern it's significantly cheaper over two years (actually, I've been upgrading more like every year for a while), because I also don't need the big plan I'm forced into when buying subsidized. I haven't done the math counting in interest on buying the phone, but I'd be surprised if it didn't still come out cheaper.",1284552630

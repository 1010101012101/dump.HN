8580344,comment,8580007,8580007,0,0,siberianbear,,,"Wow, now that is really a blast from the past. I&#x27;m a similar age to the guy who wrote that article and had a similar experience of trying to figure all this stuff out.<p>Blue Boxes (at least where I lived) no longer worked, but black boxes and red boxes worked. I don&#x27;t know when blue boxes ever worked, but I have the impression it was in the seventies, or at the latest, the early eighties. A black box was a circuit you put on your line to pick up a call without dropping the voltage on the line enough for the phone company to think you&#x27;d actually answered. So, your friend could call you long-distance (even internationally) and you could talk to them without them having to pay a long distance charge. The problem was that you could always hear the ringing every few seconds in the background and their voice was attenutated. It was fun and it kinda worked, but I didn&#x27;t use it that much because it was so annoying.
The red box was a device for making free phone calls from pay phones. It faked the tones you inserted for a nickel, a dime, or a quarter. You could just hold it up to the speaker of a pay phone and just hit the button. I built one off a schematic I downloaded. At most pay phones it didn&#x27;t work at all, but I found two that it worked at. I&#x27;d go there and call all my friends in distant states and call them for hours. Every time the operator would come on and ask for money, I&#x27;d hold up the device to the speaker and press the &quot;quarter&quot; button a few times.<p>Later I got hold of &quot;hacking&quot; programs for &quot;MCI&quot; codes and other providers. Actually, MCI was more sophisticated that most of the other providers, and quickly shut off hackers. There were a lot of other providers that weren&#x27;t so smart. The way the programs worked is by dialing an 800 number, some &quot;user ID code&quot; and then a known modem number. If a computer answered (i.e., you got a carrier tone from a modem), you knew that the code was good. If not, you tried another code. These computer programs would just try random codes all day using a known-good modem number and then print you a list of the successful codes.<p>As I started to learn more about this stuff, I did crazier stuff like call all over the world. In this era of Skype it&#x27;s free to call all over the world, but in 1984 placing international phone calls was really expensive. But I&#x27;d call my teenage hacker friends in England and Australia and just chat with them for hours. At retail rates, I was running up a couple of thousand dollars a month in phone charges.<p>Occasionally I&#x27;d hear of someone in my circle of friends getting busted in some way, but in my teenage naivete I figured it couldn&#x27;t happen to me. When I was sixteen and got a driver&#x27;s license, I met some of the hackers that were within driving distance. One of them got busted at his house: the police arrested him and took all his computer equipment. Since he was a minor he got off with a slap on the wrist, but he didn&#x27;t get his computers back. I knew that my time was coming soon, since there were already some hints my phone line was being tapped by companies I was stealing from.",1415555279

A stack frame is removed every time you get to the end of a function and return. So, yes, the stack is closely linked to the depth of function calls.<p>However, in modern systems (or basically anything you&#x27;ll ever see today, including the cheapest microcontrollers), the stack doesn&#x27;t just keep track of where to return to after each function completes. It also stores all the local variables used by the function. This is vital because it allows the variables to be restored after you return from a &#x27;deeper&#x27; function. A convenient side effect is that when the function completes and the frame is popped off the stack, the references to the local references are destroyed and the data can be garbage-collected.<p>In this sense, local variables are directly related to stack frames. If your system doesn&#x27;t store local variables in the stack frame, it almost certainly doesn&#x27;t store them anywhere else (stack frames are the natural place for them), and you&#x27;ve only got globals to work with.",1415553010

Dost thou not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, the bees working together to put in order their several parts of the universe? And art thou unwilling to do the work of a human being, and dost thou not make haste to do that which is according to thy nature?- But it is necessary to take rest also.- It is necessary: however nature has fixed bounds to this too: she has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet thou goest beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient; yet in thy acts it is not so, but thou stoppest short of what thou canst do.

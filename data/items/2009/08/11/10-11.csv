The problem is that this is happening in the first place...<p>I'm not sure i can reasonably come up with a solution.  My first thought is to have more shelters, some policies about not enforcing crimes that a) don't hurt people and b) are unavoidable and lessons for cops on dealing with the homeless in a productive manner, but I am as far from an expert as one can me.  Anyone with more knowledge on this topic have any ideas?<p>Edit: Sorry, I went a little off track here.  Obviously what was happening did hurt you (in the form of lost business), but I'm seeing what happened as the end result of a problem.",1249988335

I was just trying to point out two things.\n1) While the rest of the article presents great points, this point is much weaker.\n2) Lawmakers need to take the content of this article to heart.  Unfortunately, the mention of drugs will probably make that less likely.",1249988096

Not sure if there is a market there for it, what do you think? Just going to chuck it out there...<p>I am sure everyone has noticed the rise of cafes and tons of other places offering wifi all over the world and from what I can see there are lots of people sitting in these places mainly for the wifi.<p>Anyways, what I am wondering is do you think the demand for a place where you can sit down in a comfortable environment and use the wifi got to the point where it be almost viable to open airport lounge type places in city centers?<p>I think you would have to start in a premium end of the market and charge an entry fee of $10 or something. Obviously have other revenue streams from food or what not but hopefully you get the idea.<p>Basically think of it like a really spacey cafe / business center / internet cafe type place...",1249987894

754963,comment,754859,754904,0,0,barrkel,,,"That depends on what you mean by ""interactive movie"". I've seen some games that rely too heavily on cutscenes, and other games that keep the character pretty strictly on rails (e.g. Call of Duty and Half-Life series), and I generally detest both of those.<p>I like to get into high tactics, if not strategy, in the FPSes I play, which means I like games that have the scope and openness for emergent action. Typical examples would be Far Cry and Far Cry 2 (but not Crysis, being spoiled by the suit's power). These aren't really what I'd call interactive movies, because even though they have plot to keep the character moving along, the main meat of the game is in how you tackle ""action bubbles"" - but those action bubbles are nice and broad that there's plenty of scope for deception, diversion, distraction, improvisation with explosives in the environment, and an openness to lots of different approaches that linear games like Half-Life (particularly 2 and episodes) can never really match.",1249987344

Things were looking up and then a day labor place opened up on the block.<p>Not all day laborers are homeless but many are. Initially I was very laissez faire about them but eventually they began to create a mess of empty bottles and trash, and harass the customers.<p>It killed business. It ended up taking about 4 months of calling the police on a daily basis and getting dozens of homeless trespass warranted to get things back on track.<p>It sucks but I felt I had little choice. If I had left things alone I would have gone out of business. Defaulted on my loan and had to lay off 12 people.<p>What you gonna do, this problem is huge.",1249986996

754957,comment,754054,754054,0,0,jorleif,,,"I've done the same thing he describes, of building a large system that would be quite small with modern tools. I wonder what could be to alleviate the problem. Of course good factoring of code and using a high-level programming language so that the existing code-base is as small as possible help somewhat. It feels to me that the real solution would be to make a stronger separation between the business logic and the actual implementation. In a way the code for a piece of software is an overspecification of what that software should do. It contains both a set of decisions that are necessary for the problem, and some that are necessary for the actual implementation, but otherwise arbitrary. In some way, one should build a ""problem model"" that is executable. Then the actual system would interact with this domain model. Then when the software infrastructure improves, the problem solved presumably does not change as much and most of it could be reused.",1249986330

I have looked (briefly) into the Open Document standard (I think that was the name), but it seemed too painful to me. I have some faint hope that creating word documents via the Open Office scripting API could be easier.<p>That is, rather than trying to create valid XML, just call a method on an empty open office doc that say 'creteHeading(""abc"")'<p>And so on... Of course probably it won't work, but it is the only hope I see on the horizon. (My problem is actually going from LaTex to Word).",1249985778

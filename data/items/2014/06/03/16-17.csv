So the user model would return &quot;users/user&quot; and your guest object could return &quot;users/guest&quot;.<p>The problem with using nil here is that you have to remember to check it <i>everywhere</i>, all of your tests have to exercise both the nil and not-nil cases, and most of the &quot;else&quot; clauses are just going to substitute default values anyways.<p>In my opinion if your views know so much about your user model that substituting a &quot;guest&quot; object is hard, maybe it&#x27;s a sign you need to pull some logic back out of your views.",1401814798

Because Tony Hoare introduced null references to Algol W, most Algol-derived and Algol-inspired statically typed languages since have made all pointers/references nullable.  Some, like Java, have bolted on Lint-like null checkers an afterthought (see @Nullable, @NotNull) outside of the official compiler.<p>It&#x27;s really nice to have the compiler not allow callers to pass null to functions where passing null wouldn&#x27;t make sense, isn&#x27;t useful, or the programmer was just too lazy to implement null checks.  More than half of the functions I write have inputs where null wouldn&#x27;t have an obvious meaning.<p>Objective-C&#x27;s treatment of nil receivers is particularly handy for programming in the small and particularly bad for programming in the large.  Sending a message to nil (similar to calling a method on null in many other languages) does nothing other than returning 0 cast to the type of variable you&#x27;re storing the return value in.  Chugging along accidentally accumulating nulls in many cases is worse than segfaulting and giving a nice stack trace.<p>Certainly in the realm of automated trading software, segfaulting when hitting a programming error is preferable to most other failure modes.

7841285,comment,7833379,7841117,1,0,dragonwriter,,,">  I care about what I eat<p>Then you <i>can&#x27;t avoid learning to estimate portions</i>. And once you do that, the way most standard food logging apps, web or mobile, work should generally work (there is room for improvement in friction, in some cases, but not in the particular area of making the app guess more.) There&#x27;s no shorter cut from which meaningful results can be gathered. And its not that hard.<p>> On calorie counting apps, the serving sizes are almost always useless.<p>They aren&#x27;t &quot;useless&quot;, they do require you to understand portions. They replace manually logging and tallying what is logged, not actually recognizing what it is you are eating.<p>> This burger is measured in ounces -- is that before or after cooking?<p>Pre-cooked. Its the generally-accepted standard (most logging systems I&#x27;ve seen expressly indicate this, though some don&#x27;t).<p>> I think if you&#x27;re neurotic or otherwise obsessed with tracking your calories super seriously, then maybe you&#x27;re right. But in my experience, most of my friends who start using calorie counting apps stop using calorie counting apps, because it&#x27;s so much damned work to track everything they eat all day long.<p>Calorie counting apps aren&#x27;t useful, though, if the user isn&#x27;t visually making meaningful estimates (and, yes, they&#x27;ll generally be estimates if you aren&#x27;t preparing it yourself) of quantitative portion sizes and specific included elements beyond &quot;1 to 5&quot; ratings of healthiness -- <i>because</i> of the very kinds of variability that you yourself point to. Calorie counting apps <i>can</i> facilitate the process of tracking, but they <i>can&#x27;t</i> replace the recognition and quantification of what you are eating part (which, yes, is <i>initially</i> the hard part of food tracking -- but its also the part that gets easy with experience.)<p>There&#x27;s some pretty simple rules of thumb for visually estimating portion sizes, etc., that can be helpful if you <i>aren&#x27;t</i> eating a predefined menu item that is already in the apps database, and its possible that UX could be improved by facilitating access to guidance on those when logging such items. But that&#x27;s different than the model you propose, which has serious GIGO problems.<p>> I&#x27;m advocating a smarter system. I&#x27;m guessing, which is more work than I want to do. Do the guessing for me. Do the work for me.<p>Sorry, you&#x27;re the one who has the sensory input from which to make a meaningful estimate. Its obviously not impossible for a machine to do this, given the right sensors and the right application of them to the food, but its not going to save you any work on a smartphone platform.<p>> I&#x27;m happy to say &quot;I think it was 1.5 servings and relatively healthy<p>Yes, but that&#x27;s not meaningful input from which any useful information can be gained. Unless you have a well-calibrated consistent definition of a serving -- in which case, you can just as well say how many ounces, etc., it was.",1401814186

It&#x27;s true, that under the assumptions of the paper, a 10 percent increase of the minimum wage increases operating costs by about 1 to 2 percent.  However, the paper assumes that this increase only affects a small number of workers by a small amount (1/3 of the workers have their wages increased by 5%).  A 100 percent increase in wages will affect almost everyone working in the restaurant industry (not just the 1/3 of workers the paper assumes).  And it will affect them by a large amount, not 5%.  Thus, the results of the paper don&#x27;t simply scale linearly with the size of the increase in the minimum wage.  Under simple assumptions (of the kind made by the paper cited) I calculate that costs to restaurants will rise by over 30%.  It could end up more or it could end up less, the paper didn&#x27;t provide a distribution of wages in the restaurant industry which would more accurately answer this question.<p>In any case, you should realize that this is a major increase in costs to restaurants, not just 1 or 2 percent.<p>The numbers I&#x27;ve seen for profit margins in restaurants range from 2 to about 3 percent.  Since 1/3 of costs in restaurants come from labor, a 30% increase in labor costs will mean that restaurants will have a negative profit margin of around 7 or 8 percent after the new minimum wage goes into effect.<p>This means that eventually there will likely be less workers, higher prices for food, and less restaurants.",1401813696

Otherwise the bus driver can&#x27;t buy dinner that evening.<p>In a place where human labor is cheap, materials are expensive, and enforcement of contracts is sketchy, keeping people waiting while you assess their character may be preferable to making a hasty commitment.<p>Maybe not every difference is explainable this way but I think a lot of them are.<p>If alien anthropologists arrived, they might look at our space programs and conclude that we had a different conception of time.

Time can be, and often is, started and stopped relative to that moment. Launches may have a published, scheduled time, but everyone expects it to be deferred until consensus is achieved that conditions are right. We are also careful that each launch be carefully timed to use an auspicious window, dependent on the planets around us and other cyclical conditions.<p>The alien anthropologist, ignorant of how his powerful ship even works, notes that he takes off whenever he wants to and just goes in a straight line to wherever he likes.

How healthy was it? How many common-sense servings do you think you just ate?<p>My point is that the numbers regular calorie counters give are very exact numbers -- 489 calories for a Big Mac -- but food is rarely served perfectly. Two burgers cooked within 10 minutes of each other at the same restaurant might vary wildly in the number of calories, depending on the size of the patty, the amount of seasonings and butter and what-have-you added to the dish, and so on. At the end of the day, I&#x27;m just guessing.<p>On calorie counting apps, the serving sizes are almost always useless. This burger is measured in ounces -- is that before or after cooking? How many ounces is the burger I just got from the restaurant? I know a Quarter Pounder with Cheese from McDonalds is, well, 4 oz (before cooking!), but does that translate 1:1 with my app? Who the hell knows?<p>I think if you&#x27;re neurotic or otherwise obsessed with tracking your calories super seriously, then maybe you&#x27;re right.

Values can be heterogeneous too.<p>As far as type safety goes, Swift is on par with modern languages.<p>ObjC also inherited several security issues of the C language, like unchecked arrays and unchecked arithmetic. Swift performs bounds checking by default (you can manipulate raw arrays with `UnsafePointer<T>`) and has checked arithmetic by default (you can allow overflows by prefixing the operator with `&`, so `&*`, `&+`, etc). It also never requires you to allocate and deallocate buffers yourself.<p>So Swift is more secure because it has no buffer overflows, no integer overflows (though they&#x27;re more an issue when you have buffer overflows) and no unsafe memory management. These are by far the three most commonly exploited vulnerabilities in software.",1401812404

This is the primary reason that Larson believes Swift can reach a much larger number of developers.<p>Ummm...

I think this is a good answer to the question of &quot;why would a physicist be working on the Monster group&quot; that addresses the core idea of required invariants, and one along the lines that I have heard before (I suppose at this point I should confess to be an ex-physicist, although I never studied QED at anything but the most elementary level).<p>But, having heard it, I feel wanting. As you have deftly illustrated, starting with some basic requirements about invariants (from special relativity) you can end up at the Lagrangian associated with QED. And you can then (after the fact!) point out that the field in question is the electromagnetic one. Having studying electromagnetism enough to know what you are talking about, I can hear this kind of argument and it seems clever to me. There is some difference in semantics of the states, of course (classical solution of of the confined electromagnetic field coming in quanta, but perhaps not understood as &quot;quantum observables&quot; proper). But if I had not studied these things I would probably just be confused.<p>And I think this is how I feel when I hear about this advanced quantum gravity stuff (once again, I don&#x27;t mean to complain about your excellent response, I think it just addresses a different issue then the one I am talking about).<p>If you are willing to entertain me, I&#x27;ll try to ask a clarifying question in terms of analogy. If someone asked me &quot;why does the Lagrangian for QED looks like it does&quot;, I might say to them that &quot;the speed of light (light being made of electromagnetic fields) is constant in all inertial reference frames (lets hope they understand Galilean relativity) and that this fact forces QED to look that way&quot;. This explanation makes reference to the &quot;stuff&quot; that the field is made out of and the observations about invariants (stated in ordinary language) that it must satisfy.<p>So, now if I ask &quot;why does the Lagrangian for quantum gravity looks like it does&quot;, you would say...",1401812330

I&#x27;m not sure how to reconcile those two things.\n<a href=""http://docs.raneto.com/commercial-licensing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.raneto.com/commercial-licensing</a>",1401811408

If I was in Scotland raising money and Americans came to Scotland to invest, there would be no SEC issues (assuming I wasn&#x27;t marketing to Americans; of course, this may imply qualified investors anyway). The problem is what it means to &quot;come to Scotland&quot; and to &quot;market to Americans&quot; has changed with the internet. So the question becomes how to differentiate actively courting US investors from local investors, and it&#x27;s an important question to keep any government (especially the US, unfortunately) from overstepping it&#x27;s sovereign rights and encroaching on another country&#x27;s.",1401811365

But when you iterate using for..in the key will be a string not the original array, and you lose that data.  The string is now indistinguishable from the subset of strings with comma delimkted data.  May that is inconsequential in your app but for some apps it dampens the effectiveness of the construct.<p>Ain't JavaScript a riot? [I just found an excuse to use snowclone in an HN comment.

1150972,comment,1150735,1150925,0,0,jerf,,,"""How do you deal with things that write files out or communicate with other processes?""<p>I have the tested code write the files out, then I have the test code examine the files. I have the tested code communicate with the other processes, then examine the results, possibly querying the other processes to see whether they got what they should get and did what they should do. I make it so it's easy to put the files in a temporary location, easy to start up test processes for the test to communicate with, and then test the system at this higher level.<p>I am aware that this is counter to the unit testing dogma. I am aware this requires certain amounts of access to the code of all parts of the system, but I usually either have it or make it a priority to get it. So far, the predictions of doom if I do this have failed to manifest.<p>And I've learned that when someone predicts doom that fails to manifest, that's usually because the predictions are based on untested theories and not actual experience. This happens to an <i>absolutely shocking degree</i> in our industry; the amount of software design dogma that is basically just one guy with a PhD's opinion he stated in a paper once 20 years ago, followed by a huge game of telephone, can hardly be understated.<p>(Your homework exercise, if you don't believe this, is to find the published, peer-reviewed paper in which it was determined that unit tests work best if they only test the smallest possible units. Good luck. If that doesn't float your boat, pick your favorite bit of OO-design dogma, like the Law of Demeter, and trace back where it came from. Even good ideas generally don't have the sort of actual support you might think from how far the ideas tend to spread. My take-away from that is that not only is it OK to question, it is a necessity.)<p>Everywhere your test code tests something other than the actual code is a place where bugs can hide. Mock objects are basically a systematic way for providing those places for bugs to hide. I agree with silentbicycle that they have a small place, but IMHO systematic use of them is wrong.",1267116759

There have been other projects, such as Dojo that make the complex tasks of JavaScript easier, and these I find incredibly useful, but to change the syntax of the language without significantly reducing the code size and complexity does not present a lot of value for the project.

It's hard to reason with someone who thinks that Singleton is great because it saves memory even if you told the person that it's negligible.

Here's my thoughts:<p>> I'd be willing to support legislation such as that proposed, if it included dis-incentives (i.e. significant tariffs and fees) for companies who outsource.<p>In the modern economy, setting tariffs is akin to declaring trade warfare. A few years ago, then-President Bush was advocating a tariff on steel to protect U.S. businesses, and the EU responded that they'd counteract with a broad set of tariffs on American exports. The plan fell through.<p>The only countries you can get away with placing tariffs on are countries you hurt tremendously by doing so. Things like the tariff on sugar which really hurts Caribbean countries while making American High Fructose Corn Syrup the #1 alternative. The Chinese and Indian markets are already and will continue to become more important to American companies. It might even be impossible to place a tariff/tax/penalty on companies who outsource due to Most Favored Nation terms in treaties, but even if it was - you really don't want to mess around with two countries that have a combined population over 2 billion, who are growing rapidly, and who are very important to the USA. Never mind the economics of how it'd change prices - setting a tariff creates a nasty domino effect of hostility in international relations and isn't really feasible in the modern world. So, count me firmly against that idea, but I do apologize for downvoting you. You expressed an idea you had that I disagree with, and I should've responded without voting.",1267114913

1150899,comment,1150735,1150838,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Dr. Richard Hipp (the main author of SQLite) once said in a tech talk that one of the big advantages of having thorough automated testing is that you can freely optimize or replace individual components without being held back by worrying about unknowingly breaking something. (I think he said they've replaced the query optimizer several times.) This fits my experience, and I think it's what Michael Feathers is getting at when he defines legacy code as ""code without tests"".<p>I'm not convinced that letting testing <i>drive</i> the design process is always a good idea (though the benefits of test-<i>informed</i> development are harder to argue), but having thorough tests is usually a huge win. Having thorough tests isn't free, particularly with good coverage, but it usually pays for itself in the long run.<p>> I also avoid mock objects like the plague, aggressively preferring to either build the interface to be testable in the first place, or failing that, adding some hooks in the tested code itself, rather than trying to push it onto the code from the outside.<p>Same here. Mock objects can be useful when trying to retrofit tests onto existing code, but that's just a concession to practicality. Reworking a huge, untested code base to make it testable can be a great way to introduce bugs unless done with extreme caution. (That's the main topic of Feathers's book, FWIW.)",1267114504

Regardless of which layer you are testing(unit, integration, functional), it is important to write a testing API.  If you have a bunch of copy, paste, change one line unit tests, it is going to be very difficult to change an API.  However, if you have one API call, ""go and do this thing high level thing"", then when the underlying API changes, you just change the implementation of that one API level function.  The tests end up more readable as well because they read like english.  ""Setup a basic environment that looks like this."" ""Change the behavior of the one thing I am testing.""  ""Validate the response"".<p>If you are writing functional tests, the same thing applies.  For a UI, you might have an API that reads like. ""Go to the home page."" ""Create a User"".  ""Login"".  ""Go to the page I want"".  ""validate this one behavior"".<p>Since all tests are using an API, you just change the implementation of the API call.  For example, if I change the number of fields required to login, I only have to change the login API call.  For all the tests that used it, they don't care about how you login, because that wasn't the thing they were trying to test.  It was just a pre-req.",1267114130

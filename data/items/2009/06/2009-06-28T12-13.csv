677685,comment,677439,677576,0,0,sucuri2,,,"I will check that.. On FF/Ubuntu it is working well. I should have tested it on multiple browsers before.<p>As for the disabled buttons, that exactly what i did, but on Gimp :)<p>For the snapshots, you get alerts on intentional and unintentional changes. We have some algorithms to ignore common/normal changes (like polls, number of visitors, # of comments, etc), but it is almost impossible for us to detect if a change is authorized or not, that's why we alert on all of them.<p>*I will check out launchly now. the idea sounds great.",1246193312

I will probably move that to the ""tools"" page to avoid too much noise.<p>It is going to be free, and once we are out of beta, we will start with premium accounts with more features.",1246192704

I spend hours adding and removing messages from there trying to make it clean, but at the same time explaining what it does.",1246192541

677676,comment,675256,675256,0,0,mpf62,,,"I'd like to mention another problem in the B2B space: customers often feel uncomfortable buying from very small businesses. And in decision processes where Consultants are involved you can almost be sure that they usually do recommend bigger companies.<p>I'm a one man show myself and I've experienced the problems described above many times. Even in one case where I was the only bidder who could actually prove with a working prototype that I would be able to realize the rather complex solution, they chose one of the big players who could only provide prettier brochures (btw. they had to shut down the project after burning over 100K).<p>Furthermore, it is often not easy to enter conservative markets as a new player. Established companies are almost always preferred in such markets.<p>Therefore, my recommendation would be (it worked well for me): Look for companies that already are doing business in your target industry successfully, try to win them as resellers and become an OEM. This way you can profit from their reputation and you can reduce your marketing/sales efforts, too.<p>I don't know if this tip comes too late for you, but that would be the first thing I would try right now if I were in your position.",1246192225

Of course that right after doing exercise you're not at your top performance... but stop for a while and the benefits of months of training will show.<p>In other words, he's comparing long time IQ change, and you're talking about short term.",1246192145

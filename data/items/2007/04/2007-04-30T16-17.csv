18152,comment,18107,18143,0,0,kmt,,,"That might mean that PG (and the other YC folks) would have to move as well.  AFAICT, YC wants to be close to the founders for physical meetings.  It might not be easy for YC folks to move (they have their lives, etc.).<p>Also, Boston is a niche: it is home to some bright tech people.  YC is close to them, while the valley is away, so YC is the obvious choice for Boston students.  That gives YC a competitive advantage at least in the area and makes it distinct.  Moving to the valley would make YC more generic and less of a brand.",1177950597

SocialMoth/Overhear.us have awesome design and Evan does everything.  iminlikewithyou.com is tasty (if a bit overly pretty), and I believe they do it in-house, as well.  Reddit is great and clean, and Alexis and Steve designed it.  <p>Everyone is swayed by a nice clean design, even technically savvy folks like YC (they also know that a good design can make a good product great, and with bad design the best product will probably fail--MySpace being an obvious and baffling exception to that rule).",1177949998

In fact, much of the Fortress language itself (even the definition of arrays and other basic types) is encoded in libraries atop a relatively small core language.""<p>I haven't looked at the details of Fortress yet, but I don't read 'Java' in the above quotes.",1177949492

18145,comment,17947,18008,0,0,mojuba,,,"From the web site's perspective, karma is a mechanism for internal calculations, and is in no way a measurement of your intellect or morality (?) or whatever else. And karma can't be turned into money for you, so why bother at all? :)<p>That's why a possibility of being downvoted never stopped me from commenting, be it reddit, slashdot, or YCnews.<p>One lesson that I learned from reddit in particular, is that if you are interested in the topic, you should read all comments, all the way down the page, because there might be something there, in the negative karma area.",1177949166

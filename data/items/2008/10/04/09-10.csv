The reason it [the risk-focused pitch] works well is because if there is no risk, there cannot be commensurate reward. I'll repeat it. If there is no risk, there can't be reward. If it's not a risky opportunity, then there's no reward of equal dimension. If you come to me and say, ""I've got a risk-free investment,"" the first thing I know is, there's not much money to be made. There's no free lunch in this world.</i>",1223114243

323415,comment,323348,323348,0,0,rkts,,,"cf. Hume, 1757<p>""In proportion as any man's course of life is governed by accident, we always find, that he encreases in superstition; as may particularly be observed of gamesters and sailors, who, though, of all mankind, the least capable of serious reflection, abound most in frivolous and superstitious apprehensions.  The gods, says Coriolanus in Dionysius, have an influence in every affair; but above all, in war; where the event is so uncertain. ...<p>""Any of the human affections may lead us into the notion of invisible, intelligent power; hope as well as fear, gratitude as well as affliction: But if we examine our own hearts, or observe what passes around us, we shall find, that men are much oftener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable passions. Prosperity is easily received as our due, and few questions are asked concerning its cause or author. It begets cheerfulness and activity and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every social and sensual pleasure: And during this state of mind, men have little leisure or inclination to think of the unknown invisible regions. On the other hand, every disastrous accident alarms us, and sets us on enquiries concerning the principles whence it arose: Apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity: And the mind, sunk into diffidence, terror, and melancholy, has recourse to every method of appeasing those secret intelligent powers, on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to depend.""",1223111777

However, we currently don't have any programmers in the company so doing any testing of how candidates write code and the quality of said code is going to be nigh on impossible to judge.  The most I've worked with are scripting languages and this job will require C/C++.  Does anyone have any advice on how to go about testing in a situation like this?  Feedback from both hiring/applying sides of the process would be really appreciated.<p>Thank you!",1264759186

If the pain gets too intense it becomes pretty easy to take the easy way out. Some people avoid it by going to religion, others can't make that leap and thus find another way to make it stop: suicide.<p>Sure mental illnesses needlessly cause suicide, but it's not impossible for someone to achieve a point of hopelessness where suicide becomes a natural expected rational decision.<p>But I agree with you, it should never be thought of as the rational choice, because there is always hope for better. And no, you don't have to fabricate that hope either. It's what keeps me working, applying to yc despite rejection, and staying alive the for the next day despite all my shortcomings and failures.

A lot of the writers seems to think that the critics are saying that the iPad won't sell or that nobody will like the device.

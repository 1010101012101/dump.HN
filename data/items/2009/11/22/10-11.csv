Unlambda is almost self documenting code, it's one of the first times that I'm not using 'literate programming' because there is no need for it.<p>All these newfangled languages hide what is actually going on under the hood. Unlambda is refreshingly clear and totally transparent.<p>Until you've programmed at least one 50,000 line project in a language you shouldn't be commenting on how hard it is ;)",1258887557

955628,story,,,31,40,RiderOfGiraffes,"Violins ""go to sleep"" if not played for a long time ...",,"I was chatting with a professional musician the other day, and she said something that caught my interest.  Apparently a really good violin will, if not played for a few months, ""go to sleep.""  It's difficult to say exactly what this means, but apparently its tone dies, it becomes ""less bright"" and, to the professional ear, ""sounds sleepy.""  If played again regularly and frequently for a few weeks it will then gradually ""wake up"" and become its former self.<p>Theorists occasionally doubt it and skeptics demand double-blind tests.  Practitioners laugh at them.  Many have experienced it ""first hand.""<p>I hypothesised that the wood contracts and becomes ""tighter"" when it's left alone, and that the vibration of playing will open up the texture.  She hypothesised that the glue will expand while playing, and when left alone will tighten up.<p>However, I've looked around a little and it's apparently a well-recognised phenomenon.<p>I would never have guessed, and found it interesting.<p>Compare and contrast:<p>http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22software+rots%22",1258887222

Much of the music I listen to (in the IDM, ambient and electronica genres) is sold in limited run printings now. It's not unheard of for a run of CDs or Vinyl to only amount to <100 physical copies.<p>Ironically, that seems to make me feel more guilty about pirating the music when it's not available, although I suspect, as you say, it increases the value of owning a physical copy while decreasing the 'damage' done by piracy - I should feel less guilty that I had to download it.",1258887149

For <i>Ringworld</i>, Niven invented several coherent non-human intelligences that set titanic forces in motion, and explored what the results would be like to live in. For a writer to merely ""examine ourselves"" seems almost lazy in comparison, and not at all what's unique to science fiction. <i>Dune</i> in particular was so dominated by mysticism and politics that I think it would have worked better as fantasy set in ancient Egypt.",1258886889

If there was no internet, I may have gone to a few shows here and there when a big name artist came through town, but because of the internet, I listen to a much wider variety of bands and choose to support those artists by going to their concerts.<p>There's a totally different experience to actually being in a crowd listening to a band. I may have a (near) perfect recording on my computer or iPod, but there are many nuances that you miss out on when you listen to music at home.<p>From the artist's perspective, there's nothing like playing live. Playing in a studio is worlds apart from playing with your fans right in front of you. I know quite a few artists that love that, myself included.",1258886220

I seriously doubt Spotify is valued at around 50,000 euros.<p>Artists are generally short changed when it comes to this sort of thing, whether it be selling music or streaming it. Artists make the bulk of their money in ticket and merchandise sales. It would be far more interesting to see how much the record companies are making per 1 million plays. It might also be shockingly low, but I somehow doubt that the record companies would sign a deal where they made little more than a few hundred bucks per 1 million plays.",1258885576

They could be doing so much more with their service for the community, and I don't mean going the big time corporate route obsessed with short-term revenue.<p>There have been many CL clones(kijiji), but none gained enough eyeballs to make an interoperating API work. I suspect these attempts failed because they didn't pay attention to the community and instead acted liked closed corporations right out the starting gate.

Give your music away for almost nothing (or dirt cheap) and then play your own shows.</i><p>This is <i>The Problem</i> for the record industry - there's an almost infinite supply of very talented musicians that are thrilled to do exactly what you suggest.  That makes it extremely difficult to buy the argument that we won't have music anymore if people aren't willing to pay for records.  It just not true, all we'd lose is heavily produced pop music, and everyone else would continue to play because they really love it.  I don't see live gigs drying up as an income source for quite a while, and they are (just barely) enough to let plenty of people play for a living.<p>I'd add ""teach lessons"" to that list, too, that's how most of the musicians that I know actually make rent each month; gigs are just beer money if you've got a full roster of students.  Learn a few extra instruments, you don't have to be very good to teach most students - I know drummers that teach piano, pianists that teach guitar, etc.  To optimize for income, find yourself a nice rich suburb with some cheaper (but still pleasant) areas to live in around it, and teach lessons to the kids in the suburb (you can charge probably 2-3x what you'd get anywhere else, even if you're not one of the best) while living cheap a couple towns over and playing gigs in the city that you're near.",1258884588

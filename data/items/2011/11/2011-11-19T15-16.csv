3255460,comment,3255191,3255356,14,0,arethuza,,,"""nuclear weapons have prevented continuation of WW2""<p>I would tend to agree with that. However, the levels of weaponry that were deployed were arguably far higher than was actually required to achieve effective mutual deterrence - by a huge factor. If you actually read the details of what would have happened if the Cuban Missile Crisis or Able Archer 83 had ended as shooting wars then prepare to have your blood run cold and we <i>did</i> get very close to indeed to shooting wars - particularly in the case of Cuba.<p>Somewhat ironically, given that I am British, a child of the 70s/80s and not a Conservative, one of the actual heroes of the Cold War was actually Reagan - not for his ""Evil Empire"" rhetoric but because he actually had the decency to believe that your average Soviet citizen was just as decent as your average America, Brit or German. He was, by all accounts, so shocked when he heared intelligence reports of how terrified the Soviet leadership were of a possible NATO first strike that he deciced to open up a dialogue with the Soviets. For most of the Cold War it was the <i>Soviets</i> who were afraid of NATO - perhaps justifiably so as I am not aware of any military leaders in the Warsaw Pact who actively tried to start a nuclear war, which is not something we can say about the West.",1321717263

For one, you could set up your computer such that if you don't enter some key combination every minute it shuts down. Or you could set up a tricky kernel that does not allow opening/cp'ing certain files and if you try, triggers a shutdown. Or you could have speech recognition running, and as soon as you utter a certain phrase near your machine, it shuts down.<p>The point is that inaction or inadvertent action by the law enforcement may trigger an action on the machine. Such digital landmines could be made so unpredictable that there would be virtually no way to extract the data on site reliably.<p>In general, there is no solution to this problem. The person protecting their data will always be able to surprise the person that's trying to extract it. Furthermore, no government can control ""manufacture"" of encryption, the way that it can control manufacture of physical goods. It could mandate that a backdoor must be provided, or that you need to escrow your decryption key such that it could get at your data, but let's face it: people that do have something sinister to hide will not care much for this regulation anyways.",1321715614

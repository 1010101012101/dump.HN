366616,comment,366107,366307,0,0,helveticaman,,,"I think there will actually be a certain amount of this; that is, advertising dollars will migrate to the web, at the expense of traditional media.  That being said, overall ad spending will fall, spending on traditional media will get hammered, and online ad spending will also get hurt, just not as much as traditional advertising.",1226901275

366614,comment,365331,366552,0,0,netcan,,,"When an applicant is expected to provide references, they probably call first to let these references know or ask permission. Since these are often not close friends, that isn't something you want to be doing multiple times. He/She must also reveal that they are applying for a job, something they may not want to discuss given the likelihood of rejection.
If you are going to 5 - 10 interviews over the course of several months, that's a reasonable inconvenience to juggle.<p>To avoid this the hiring company would simply have to obtain this information at a later stage. As you mention, they would have been in contact anyway to discuss compensation & such. A pretty minor detail.<p>Some things are unavoidable: Writing a job application is more emotionally draining & time consuming then reading one. Interviewing less then being interviewed.<p>But things like these really put to light the asymmetry: A major inconvenience for the applicant is acceptable to avoid a minor one for the employer.<p>I think the reason you get such seemingly strident positions from the applicant side of the street is that it feels a lot like abusing the asymmetry.",1226901134

366610,comment,366074,366515,0,0,litewulf,,,"""Post-religion anti-indoctrination memetic inoculation""<p>Those words all make sense in my head, but not really together. I really don't understand the anti-religious dogma, I think that there is a gradient in the beliefs of religious people and while there are definitely some reactionary elements, I don't think people who are ""anti-progress"" are united by religion.<p>Anyway, global average makes a great deal more sense, and I'd be willing to believe it'd work, but have my doubts on how fast most modern nations are willing to transform themselves into seas of highly educated citizenry. (Not to mention its hardly known at this point what the ""best"" education method is, so I'd imagine even such a fundamental retooling would involve lots of split testing at first ;))",1226900368
366609,comment,366587,366587,0,0,kirse,,,"Is anyone aware of research done into how mentally stimulating various video games are?  Maybe someone with one of those open-source EEGs could hook themselves up and do us a favor?<p>This article comes at an interesting time because I noticed recently that playing games like Rockband leave me much more mentally fired up - and tougher to calm down afterwards (oh, the irony...) - versus playing games like Team Fortress 2.<p>My guess is that it'd be correlated to how much direct focus the game requires.  Obviously one can't do much else when they're concentrated on getting thousands of colored dots played perfectly.",1226900261

Good marketing / positioning, creating solid referral relationships, as well as staff training (which brk nicely discusses) would probably add more than the math model would.<p>Which is almost a shame, since modeling is so much fun!",1226898616

If someone is capable of getting angry enough to kill people (either random killings or targeted) the perspective of how/why they became unemployed may not matter much from the killer's perspective.  I'm no expert in such edge case mental instability.  I just think that when people get that far over the edge, their irrationally doesn't factor in the predicates in the same way as the rest of us.",1226898127

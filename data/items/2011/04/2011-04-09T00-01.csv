Especially his ""Five Steps"" posts[1][2] were what got me into design and made me ""get"" it. And it didn't take a lot of time to read through them. I recommend that people skip his book and read these two pieces instead.<p>Bear in mind that the grid guide is more of an intro piece; you probably won't be able to create grid-based websites after reading it (I know I wasn't).<p>Another good resource is Typography for Lawyers[3]. I'm actually very surprised (and disappointed!) that Paul didn't mention it. It's recently undergone a redesign, which has rendered all its former links broken, and it seems a little harder to navigate and browse for fun, but you <i>must</i> flip through the digital pages. It's probably the best typography resource for newcomers along with Boulton's 5-step guides.<p>I also just combed through my bookmarks to see if Boulton had anything else, and a great presentation popped up[4]. It, too, is great to get you into the typographic mindset.<p>These are really the best way to get someone into typography, and they are quick to read; no resounding <i>THUMP</i> from dumping seemingly insurmountable literature on your desk.<p>Of course, once you've got the bug, it'll never leave you, and a lot of the world will look a lot worse and be more painful for it. Educate yourself at your own risk.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-better-typography"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-st...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-steps-to-designing-grid-systems-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/five-simple-st...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/?page_id=1876"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/?page_id=1876</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webtypography.net/sxsw2007</a><p>NB!

I know you mean well and I wish I could offer you more encouragement. Hopefully others are able to do so.<p>I'm writing this with more than ten years of experience providing international response search and rescue services. We got started after getting frustrated by our inability to get obviously needed supplies into disaster zones. It turned out to be easier to provide services. Along the way we learned a lot about the road blocks and solutions.<p>I've seen warehouses full of supplies from the US donated by  well meaning charities. Thousands of people donated clothing, packaged it up, shipped it out, and expected to make a difference. But there it sat, rotting in the heat and humidity. The intended recipients thought ""those damned stupid Americans, sending us stuff we don't need."" The donors thought ""those lazy recipients, not putting our goodwill to use.""<p>There are valid reasons why the Red Cross and other agencies say ""Just send money."" Just because a disaster has occurred doesn't mean that customs inspections stop, or taxes aren't collected.<p>A clip about one mayor's village doesn't accurately portray the entire picture, including what is already in the pipeline, if they'll still be there the next week, and the logistical problems of getting anything there.<p>You can send money in seconds. Supplies take days, or weeks, and these situations are very fluid. Send the money and it can adapt to the current situation. Send supplies and they'll rot, and possibly clog the network, if the situation has changed.<p>Getting ""the stuff"" from here to the port in Japan doesn't take care of all the distribution past that point. For starters, someone needs to break down your containers into smaller packages and route them via whatever means are available to their intended destination. (And those means are already shipping other things.)<p>And someone needs to track what is still needed, what has arrived, what is in transit, etc.<p>There are a lot of very complex pieces to the puzzle.

Is your opinion informed by experience?<p>Dismissing javascript as a 'play language' is to ignore, well, the internet. Sure, it's imperfect.. maybe more than most languages. But it's also wildly powerful, and there are plenty of ways to make large js codebases quite reasonable (ours is, and we build one of the most complex javascript front ends I'm aware of).<p>Suggesting that C++ would be a better language for writing web UIs really seems especially ridiculous to me. Have you written GUIs in C++? I have, and I assure you they're no nicer to maintain than javascript ones. In fact both languages require a similar amount of discipline and order to grow maintainable codebases with. The same is true for pretty much everything.. and when it comes down to it.. front-end code of any format can be very hard to keep manageable.<p>Javascript with tools like google's closure kit is about as reasonable as anything else I've built a front end with.",1302308115

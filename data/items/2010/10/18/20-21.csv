1805116,comment,1803351,1803815,0,0,DanWeinreb,,,"Peter, you imply that Python is better for, or more like, pseudo-code, but why is it better?  In my opinion, it is better for most people because they were taught syntaxes more like that of Python than that of Lisp.  An important factor in easy-of-understanding is to be similar to something you are already familiar with.  To the extent that this is the reason, it's not implicit in Lisp vs. Python, but rather more a question of which style of syntax is better-known.",1287435501

(We encouraged humor, and flaming as long as it was witty, so it was a lot of fun.)  What you say is true to an extent.  Macros, like most things, can be abused.

1805090,comment,1803994,1803994,0,0,bobf,,,"I attended Startup School, and felt Andy's recap did justice to the talks he chose to cover; however, as he said, there's lots more to learn by watching the justin.tv video archives. Two things I absolutely loved that Andy didn't mention:<p>1) Tom Preston Warner's focus on ""optimizing for happiness instead of money"". Watching the archives out of order won't give the same feeling as being there in person, but Tom's talk provided a very, very different point of view from the other 10 speakers (bootstrapping vs. angel/VC funding). Also, aside from Startup School, my impression of Tom is that he has very strong convictions about his ideals and is extremely hard-working. He was at the airbnb party after Startup School, and was inside talking to people, then moved outside - presumably because it was too loud inside to really converse effectively without yelling. I hadn't seen him for a while before I left, then saw he was still outside talking at ~12:30.  He's now answering questions ""all day"" today on HN at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1804443"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1804443</a><p>2) Brian Chesky was also one of my favorite speakers.

What it does not have is static typing.<p>I am at the SPLASH conference, and the Dynamic Language Symposium is happening right now.  There is controversy over whether we can find a way to have the benefits of both static and dynamic typing in the same language.  The great advances in type inference make me hopeful.  The keynote speaker, Allan Wirfs-Brock, replied to my question about this with more pessimism.  It is not a simple question; for one thing, not everybody even agree about which factors are ""pro"" or ""con"" for either static or dynamic.

I'll try to use well known to hn tech examples to illustrate.<p>Early years (during the hedge fund):\n1) The ""cigar butt"" value-investor -- looking for companies which held more book value (assets like cash on hand, factories, etc.) than capitalization (stock price times shares outstanding).  Arguably Sun Microsystems (right before Oracle bought them) and Yahoo now are pretty close to this in big tech companies, but back in early/mid 20th century, there were LOTS of these.<p>2) Value investing -- looking for brands which have growth potential but are undervalued by the market.  Apple right after Steve Jobs returned would be a tech example.<p>3) Special case situations, like arbitrage -- for instance, right before a merger, buying one or the other stock, and if you have someone like Apple releasing a product which has a component from one vendor, buying that vendor's stock.<p>WB largely ended this strategy for two reasons: it was successful enough to use up most of the available opportunities (as well as attract copycats), and it was very labor/research intensive for the returns you could get -- good percentage returns, but it was difficult to employ large amounts of money.  Sort of like angel investment vs. mezzanine IPO financing.<p>Mid years (70s and 80s): insurance<p>WB discovered the insurance industry (through GEICO), and basically had ""free money"" to invest (which is what an insurance company does with premiums).  He went from value investing to buying entire companies (or large shares) which he thought would grow and remain good companies.<p>Late years: (1990s to now): top-quality\nHe basically has the problem of having too much money to invest, and thus can only go after the largest opportunities; a 10x return on $1m is not enough to move the needle.  Thus, WB and BH buy entire top-quality companies, with a focus on sustained performance, vs. making a lot of speculative bets.<p>The old-school WB (and even better, Ben Graham, his early role model), is the only interesting one to me -- once he had established his track record doing something well, he was in a position to make reasonable investments no matter what.

The client's IT team are comfortable with Javascript, so we decided to build the application side in Javascript. One choice was node.js, another was to push the UI down into the browser.<p>As it happens, there is no requirement for more UX than a web application would deliver, so we are essentially delivering the ""application server"" inside the browser.

If you have less than a certain number of addresses, they're actually not  advertiseable, because ISPs will filter smaller announcements. Even if you have a portable allocation, you may find it difficult (ie, expensive) to get your ISP to advertise it.<p>Yes, my home IP addresses are not portable...  but IP portability <i>doesn't matter</i> until you have a large number of IP addresses.   Ok, so I have to renumber the 8 servers I have in the garage, big deal.    Now, if I have to renumber the 1000+ virtuals I've got in the data center, that is a big deal.  But my understanding is that everyone filters what's smaller than a /24, and some people filter below a /22... but at a bit over 1000, you are pushing a /22, so by the time that renumbering becomes a really impossible task, nobody filters you any longer.<p>Now, if you are multihoming for reliability rather than ease of switching ISPs, yeah, you have a good point.   DSL has been neutered in that regard, which is really fucking irritating... but I understand why they did it.  You know as well as I do that every route eats up a few bytes of ram in everyone else's BGP router, and TCAM is fucking expensive, so having a grand a month barrier before you can start adding your data to every bgp router in the world seems reasonable to me.<p>On the other hand, the barrier to getting some data center space and a multihomed /24 is pretty trivial by bay area sysadmin salary standards.   Over the next week, that's one of my projects. One of my customer has an old /24 of swamp space he wants me to announce.  It sounds like a good deal all around just 'cause my BGP foo was never good and what experience I have is old, so I get to practice on something I can break, and he gets to play in his swamp.  It's going to cost the guy nothing 'cause I want to play around... It'd probably cost him something around a grand a month if he was going with someone more professional than I am and/or if he didn't already have the swamp space.<p>But my point was that if you pay for an ISP with good connectivity, you get all the benefits of their peering efforts. You are outsourcing your BGP management to your ISP, which for most people is going to result in better service than doing it themselves.<p>I think you can get 90% of the benefits of running your own BGP with a lot less hassle out of a $200/month co-lo plan.  (just to be clear, that won't get you BGP you control or portable addresses, but if you've only got a few addresses, and the isp you chose is competent, well, that doesn't matter all that much for at least 90% of use cases.)<p>Edit:  I know little of the bittorrent protocol... but my understanding, and this may be incorrect, was that bittorrent from one computer behind a nat (without upnp or the like) to another computer behind another nat (again without upnp or a port forward or the like)  did not work well or at all... if you were behind a nat without a port forward (or upnp)  you could only talk to peers that were on a public IP or had a port forward.",1287432548

This should have been obviously wrong to them, but it wasn't.<p>Someone implemented a YAML parser that could serialize and de-serialize arbitrary objects referenced by class name.<p>It was not obvious that this meant it 'executed code', let alone that this meant it could execute _arbitrary_ code, so long as there was a predictable class in the load path with certain characteristics, which there was in Rails.<p>In retrospect it is obvious, but I think you over-estimate the obviousness without hindsight. It's always easy to say everyone should have known what nobody actually did but which everyone now does.<p>As others have pointed out, an almost identical problem existed in Spring too (de-serializing arbitrary objects leads to arbitrary code execution). It wasn't obvious to them either. Maybe it _should_ have been obvious _after_ that happened -- but that vulnerability didn't get much publicity. Now that the YAML one has, maybe it hopefully WILL be obvious next time!<p>Anyhow, that lack of obviousness applies to at least your first two points if not first three. It was not in fact obvious to most people that you could execute (arbitrary) code with YAML. If it was obvious to you, I wish you had spent more time trying to 'paul revere' it.<p>> The issue was reported to RubyGems multiple times and they did nothing.<p>Now, THAT part, yeah, that's a problem. I think 'multiple times' is 'two' (yeah, that is technically 'multiple'), and only over a week -- but that still indicates irresponsibility on rubygems.org maintainers part.  A piece of infrastructure that, if compromised, can lead to compromise to almost all or rubydom -- that is scary, that needs a lot more responsibilty than it got.  We're lucky the exploit was in fact publisizied rather than kept secret and exploited to inject an attack into the code of any ruby gem an attacker wanted -- except of course, we can't know for sure if it was or not.",1359665761

5147384,comment,5146508,5146917,10,0,sirclueless,,,"There is one huge problem with this, which is that under no circumstances can you reward people for placing larger orders than they can actually execute. If you do, you encourage people to make large orders in the hope that only part of them will execute, which can have catastrophic consequences if for some reason the whole trade executes in some unexpected case.<p>Any form of lottery is vulnerable to this. If you clamp all the timestamps to ten minute intervals, then you need some arbitrary rule to decide which of the valid trades in some time window to execute. If you randomly choose a few, you encourage people to put in more orders than they can execute. If you satisfy them partially, you encourage people to put in larger orders than they can execute.<p>As a result, the only way to do this that encourages proper behavior is to have some arbitrary competitive rule in place. The easiest and most obvious such arbitrary rule is <i>the fastest order wins.</i> This might seem anti-competitive at first glance, because it keeps out the tiny investors who can't get enough capital to compete in this area. But really, it's not that bad because it only takes a few million dollars if that to get top-notch hardware in a Manhattan or Chicago datacenter. In addition, market-making is by-and-large a commodity service: the entire HFT community can only make money when the market is inefficient, and market-maker competition makes the market more efficient. The HFT world makes money off of market inefficiencies, which are capped by the size of the market and the amount of outside investment. It's a hyper-competitive world of arbitrary rules, in place to encourage a more efficient market for investors. So you don't want to do it yourself, and you don't want to regulate them because you <i>want</i> HFT to be a insane low-margin nightmare for the benefit of everyone else.",1359665560

(Some of the operations people were often on site but located far enough away that much communication was as if they were remote.)<p>And its trend was increasingly remote.  Members sought this once and as they could, because it increased their effectiveness so much.  (And lowered costs and total time demands -- e.g. commuting -- in positions that were already delivering far more than 40 hours / week.)<p>This team outperformed the other teams by a fair margin.  And some of the truly remote members were among the most efficient and effective I've seen.<p>Throughout my career, I've seen very little evidence that physical presence -- colocation -- makes a significant positive contribution in software development.  I am biased, I will say, in that I both prefer and <i>need</i> a quiet work environment.  I feel validated or ""justified"" in this need, for me at least, in that I've consistently been one of the most effective employees in the organizations within which I've worked.  (And I've had numerous people in all sorts of roles tell me this.)<p>I don't mind colocation, if quiet offices are provided.  However, cubes <i>or worse</i> are largely de rigueur, these days, and even in such open space environments, I've witnessed not just the destructive nature of noise and interruptions, but depending upon the staff member enormous amounts of time wasted on ""socializing"" of various (very off-topic and sometimes inane) sorts.  Doubly bad in that context, in that it invariably distracts surrounding employees who are trying to work.  And it builds a conflict between not betraying teammates and one's own need to have them quiet down or take it elsewhere.<p>As for who tends to ""thrive"" in such environments?  Those who ""multi-task"", juggling lots of things shallowly to the point of making many mistakes and oversights.  Those who are constantly ""interacting"", meaning most often that they are interrupting someone else to solicit knowledge that they should have or be able to look up themselves.  Those who use the concept of ""team"" to disperse and deflect individual responsibility.<p>Granted, I and the people I've described may be a minority.  But in my observation and perhaps in staid corporate environments, those who benefit from colocation tend to be those who need to be herded and hand-held.  Those who want and are really able to get shit down, don't mind face to face but are greatly frustrated with pointless and distracting face to face.<p>(As an example of this latter, we got many of our meetings down to 15 to 30 minutes, when they were necessary.  People knew and held themselves responsible for knowing what was up, and the meeting could quickly focus on problem solving and setting a specific course.)",1359665466

Not a UI frontend with buttons for single-shot editing commands, but a real editor, that makes use of 2-dimensional space, to somehow really edit everything that matters to me about versions and sharing and changes and all that.<p>It's a really powerful metaphor. Microsoft did something very right when they released Windows Explorer with Win95, which treats your harddrive like it's a document that you're editing (i bet it's a ripoff, but that's not the point here). Copy, paste, undo, it's all there.<p>Can't we design something similar for distributed version control? How well would document-editing metaphors map to git? My underbelly feeling says that it might be a surprisingly good match, given the right visualization and editing primitives.",1359665413
5147366,comment,5146521,5147314,4,0,EliRivers,,,"""Why would I give someone 20 and then force them to spend them in a particular shop""<p>Why _wouldn't_ you do that, if the circumstances suggested it? It's a way of giving someone some freedom in choosing their gift, while restricting it to a range.<p>Maybe I want to buy someone a really nice suit, but I know they'd never do it themselves; they just can't bring themselves to spend a lot of money on a nice suit - they permanently dress in cheap clothes from discount stores. If I give them cash, they feel guilty for spending it on a suit, and also guilty if they _don't_ do that, because they know I wanted them to spend it on a nice suit. Gift voucher ahoy. I'm sure you can imagine other circumstances.<p>Others that leap to my mind are; forcing someone to buy books instead of blowing it on alcohol and skateboards; making it harder for someone to buy drugs with it (there are always ways to launder gift vouchers, but the discount can be huge); giving gift vouchers for some place they really love as a way of demonstrating that you've actually thought about it.<p>When someone gives me cash, it suggests to me that they haven't put in any effort. I'd rather they got me something that cost a fiver but they actually know I like, than giving me a twenty. I already have some money and from the point where I started working full-time, unless someone is going to give me a life-changing amount of money, they might as well not bother. A well thought-out gift-voucher can be a half-way house.<p>Furthermore, when you give someone money (unless you give a life-changing amount), it just goes into their pocket with the rest of their money. Some will go on an electricity bill, some will go on food, some will be train fare, it'll all just disappear in things they were going to do anyway. Unless they were living on the breadline, you've made no difference - there is nothing that they have, or did, that was because you gave them some money. You might as well have not bothered. Money - it's the gift people don't even notice.",1359665403

5147360,comment,5146870,5146870,22,0,at-fates-hands,,,"Having worked for a bike shop for almost ten years, this article was interesting to me.<p>Full disclosure - this is who I worked for (<a href=""http://www.eriksbikeshop.com/EriksHistory.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eriksbikeshop.com/EriksHistory.aspx</a>)<p>Some things about what made ERIKS so successful:<p>1) bike shops make almost zero money on their bikes. The margins are razor thin. They make a majority of their profit on accessories. For example, they buy kickstands for 25 cents and sell them for $12.<p>2) ERIKS actually used Macs in all their locations and used a custom built POS system. They only needed one IT guy who ran 8 stores when I was there (they have around 14 stores now). He said if they were using MS, they would've had to hire a bunch more support people. It helped keep costs down.<p>3) At first ERIK looked for lower rent, out of the way places to set up shops. What he called, ""sub-prime"" locations. Rent was lower, and because of their superior marketing, they didn't need a prime location to drive traffic.<p>4) They trained their sales staff. This was a biggie. As a new salesperson, you went through a full sales training.  You were trained in sales techniques. How to close, how to get people to buy accessories, how to approach someone, how to go through the process and asking the right questions to get to a single bike to sell. By far this is really where they separated themselves from other stores. Most places would hire bike ""enthusiasts"" and let them casually sell a bike if a person was interested. They had a very pro-sales approach and it showed in their numbers.<p>5) Keeping wages low. This is probably a contentious subject for most. But as a salesperson, I made minimum wage, with a small percentage for commission. I think it was 1 or 2% of the total sales I had. By keeping the wages low and offering in store discounts and bike manufacturing discounts (which the manufacturers offer, not ERIKS) they were able to pitch potential employees that, ""There's not a lot of money in the bike industry (lie), but people who work for us have a good quality of life and good perks of being a part of the bike community."" By keeping wages low, they increased their own bottom line.",1359665313

Going out on a limb financially is celebrated but most stories don't end with a win - just the ones we tell.</i><p>The biggest danger from startups as I see it isn't even the financial loss. That's very bad, don't get me wrong-- $100,000 losses aren't uncommon-- but it isn't the worst thing. The worst thing that comes out of startup failure is the confluence of opportunity cost with the extremely harsh age-grading of VC-istan.<p>Most industries give you 25 years to build a career, and then 15 more on the plateau before you even start to worry about age discrimination. That's something people start to face in their 60s, not 30s. In VC-istan, you have much less time and losing 2 years to a dogshit startup is catastrophic. The loss of opportunities even between 25 and 30 is a substantial drop. By 35, if you're not retired or an executive (never mind whether you actually <i>want</i> to manage) people start to ask what happened.<p>VC-istan is a hypocritical culture, because it superficially champions risk and failure, but if you don't have an unbroken stream of successes, you become yesterday's dogshit pretty much immediately. What ""we accept failure"" means in VC-istan is that people with the political skill to make their failures appear to be someone else's fault can continue their careers uninterrupted, but how is that different from the rest of Corporate America? It's not. VC-istan is just as narcissistic and intolerant of missteps. If you're not VP/Eng by 35 and a Founder by 40, goodbye.<p>The real calamity you risk in a bad startup is the career damage. You can easily end up in a position well below your level of ability in the next job, and once that happens, you're screwed because most people get bored rapidly and lose motivation when this occurs. I have no idea what happens to the people who fall under their age curve. I hope to never find out.<p>It's no wonder why people are so depressed.

5147285,comment,5145958,5146433,22,0,drudru11,,,"I will give you my 2 cents on this argument.<p>tl;dr - Python had no web frameworks built in or community favorite. Rails was a complete re-think of how to do web apps in the age of XML (acaffolding, convention over config, etc.) Every language since has now realized this and copied Rails. This is a good thing.<p>if you want a story while drinking coffee, read below...<p>I was a serious Python guy from 1996 til 2006. I still like and respect Python. Before Python, I was a wanna-be Smalltalk fan. (This is important towards the end)<p>Python always had a philosophy of 'batteries included'. This means that it will have libraries for just about everything you need as supported parts of the language. Contrast this with Perl where CPAN quality was very hit or miss. Then contrast this with Lua or Scheme. They had too many libraries and none were standard. Most of those were, again, not supported or not of production quality.<p>As a result of 'batteries included', Python was just a dream to work with. Everything was doable or easy <i>and</i> performant 'enough'. I could go on, but that still wouldn't do it justice. They had a great language design, great libraries, and portability. Python is still a great framework. They didn't have a good 'CPAN'. This was ok, since the built-ins were good. Outside of that, it was a bit of a mess.<p>However, over the years, it became obvious that Python had a huge flaw. They did not deal with HTTP or HTML well. People don't even talk about this anymore, but the promoted framework was 'Plone'. This framework was so complex and convoluted, that building a simple web app was just not possible. It is not spoken about anymore. New frameworks popped up as a result, and very few of those were much good. This was a huge problem. Most people had to build their own production system. I had to switch languages for a job in 2002, and I didn't deeply follow the web framework discussion in Python for quite some time. I can tell you this, though. There wasn't a single framework that popped up as the winner or as exciting.<p>I'm typically a conservative. When I see a new thing, my typical take away is ""this has been done before, what did they not learn from prior art"". For example, lets say someone creates a new OS. If they don't <i>really</i> understand Unix, they will get it wrong.<p>When the first Rails screen-cast came out, I took a look. There was a lot of buzz that was increasing. I go, 'what the heck, it is only 5 minutes and it is a video.'<p>What I saw was an excellent architecture for building web apps. This architecture was better than anything else out there by quite a wide margin. They supported modern HTML. Convention over configuration. ActiveRecord was truly a treasure. The default site actually looked relatively decent (vs. the typical programmer, zero whitespace, huge serif, Netscape circa 1998 site). They URL conventions looked good. This architecture was human friendly. These people understood what a modern app should look like.<p>I was sold. Just from that screencast.<p>I believe in using whatever language is needed, if the framework is excellent. I wanted to build excellent web apps, so I learned Ruby. Ruby was easy to learn, and it is as good as Python. Much to my surprise it was the first language to pull off having Smalltalk blocks! People didn't even notice this and now they really like it. Everytime I showed this to coworkers, they would go 'what is that? I don't understand'. When people eventually learn Rails, they would go.. ""check out these block things. They<p>So, in summary, Python didn't have a web framework. Rails was an excellent design, compared to <i>any</i> languages framework. Rails is pretty much going to be here for quite some time.<p>BTW, at this point. Rails is not my first choice. I think it is too heavy and web architecture has shifted a lot. Still, it would be in my top 3 choices.",1359664631

It would lend credibility to their hypotheses if they either provided their own reference or provided some measure of margin of error to the timestamps they so heavily rely upon.<p>For example, if Nanex had stated that they measured the time of release and the time of trades themselves as they appeared in CQS as observed from their machines then they could make a much more concrete statement as to whether: (a) the report was ""early"" or (b) the trades were ""early"" relative to one another. Most likely they would observe that the report appeared ""early"" as measured to their system clock (or possibly some other reference), but the trades did not appear before the report.

It was horrible and unexpected to find myself mentally unable to get my work done. Essentially it seems that the stress hormones released by constant physical & mental stress physically damages/alters the emotional centers of your brain. And over time the damage becomes more-or-less permanent. There is some research to support this, but it's a very new field (Some good research is coming out of the PTSD research being funded by the military.) I don't think it's far off to say that at least mentally, starting a company is a lot like going off to war. Less risk of physical injury perhaps, but similar risks for mental injury.<p>For healthy people, but particularly people genetically susceptible to stress-related disorders, startup work can trigger full-blown depression and bi-polar manic/depressive cycles. That's just part of the job, and you need to be prepared for it and take care of yourself.<p>IMO, successful founders are the ones that successfully cope with the inevitable manic/depressive cycles.

Most neuropsychiatrists and psychopharmacologists will freely admit that there is no real understanding of what depression is, let alone what causes it.<p>Many laypeople perceive depression as a simple chemical deficiency, much like a vitamin deficiency - give someone vitamin C and their scurvy goes away, give them SSRIs and their depression goes away.

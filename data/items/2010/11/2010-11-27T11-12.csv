1944818,comment,1944476,1944476,0,0,lyudmil,,,"I think almost everyone would agree with the crust of the argument, but I don't think CS degrees need to be eliminated. I think there's room for reform.<p>As in any other engineering discipline there are two distinct aspects in Computer Science. One is the ""more theoretical"" part, which deals with topics such as complexity, AI, operations research, language construction, databases, etc. Then, there is the ""more practical"" part, which deals with the application of the above theories to produce real solutions (what we usually refer to as ""programming"").<p>I think clearly universities are well-equipped to cover the first part. It fits well with current teaching methods and there's no reason to believe the courses would be substantially different from courses in mathematics.<p>The second part, which is what most students arguably want to learn how to do, is where I think universities really struggle. Firstly, many academics in the field aren't really qualified to teach the stuff since they have very little, often outdated knowledge of the industry. Secondly, to effectively teach ""programming"" you have to take on board a lot of subjective criteria. What makes good design or good code is inherently ambiguous. To my mind, effective ""programming"" courses have to be a lot like writing courses, where teachers lack objective criteria and teach their students best practices based on their experience of reading and writing good code. This is something CS academics are reluctant to accept, but if they did we could finally have effective CS education.",1290858808

My undergad major is ""Environmental Resource Management"" and I have a certificate in GIS (a 2/3 male field and my classes were all about 2/3 male).  I don't know if I am just oblivious or what, but it was the last week of GIS school before it dawned on me that the majority of women consistently occupied the last two rows of seats in class and a few other women floated around the classroom but I was the only woman who usually sat up front (assuming a seat was available up front, which it usually was).  I occasionally wonder why I seem to live differently from other women and why I seem to not hear or not take to heart (or something) such ""messages"".  Where are women hearing these messages?

I have a life-threatening medical condition which typically causes people to be underweight and I was quite thin as a child but put on a lot of weight as an adult (probably in part due to being prescribed steroids for my health issues).  After finally getting an appropriate diagnosis late in life, I did some research and changed my diet to address my health issues.  I have lost several dress sizes, even though that was not my goal.  I was getting plenty of positive male attention when I was a size 24-26 and my doctor was telling me to work on my health issues and not worry about my weight (because people like me are typically underweight, which is more immediately life-threatening than being overweight), so I had no goal of losing weight.  I was just trying to get healthier because I was so sick, on a lot of medication and miserable.<p>My experience tends to fly in the face of the pronouncements such studies make, so I just have a really hard time taking it seriously that you can come up with a generic suggestion for diet that will work equally well for 6 billion people.",1290857218

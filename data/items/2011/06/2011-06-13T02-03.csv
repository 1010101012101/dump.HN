For instance a change in the sun which would drastically warm or cool the earth far beyond the effects of CO2. Maybe a natural disaster or an industrial accident that had a cascade effect that would reach beyond what anyone could have seen coming. You can't do anything about either of these things but that won't stop people from suggesting it could have been avoided with the right (or more of): ""fill in the blank with your favorite solution to all problems in life.""",1307933978

I mean, in my experience, it basically went Friendster -> MySpace -> Facebook. While Facebook is certainly in the drivers seat to a much greater extent than MySpace was five or six years ago, history indicates they'll eventually be knocked off their throne. However, I haven't seen or heard of any serious newcomers in that space. I've personally seen enthusiasm for Facebook diminishing over the past year or two, but will Facebook be end up being the ultimate ""social network""? Is that basically settled?",1307933942

I will go ahead and say that further learning of languages and whatnot at your age is not necessary. If it's fun, go for it. But being well rounded by exposing yourself to things outside of technology will help flex your idea muscle (brain). Steeping yourself in tech is not the best way to come up with ideas. When I want ideas, I walk around and pay attention to how the people around me use technology and how they could better use it. Just chatting with people will help greatly. Soft skills will help you in life just as much as hard skills. Attempting to learn the sum of a college education from 15-18 is going to be harder than with the help of profs/TAs, you will miss things, and you may find yourself bored once in college (I did). So unless your goal is to be the obnoxious kid in the front row who knows all the material already, or if your goal is to do undergrad research (a better one), I wouldn't worry so much.<p>Once something cool does hit you, you'll find building it easier and more fun than any work or learning exercise.",1307933056

2647922,comment,2647301,2647301,55,0,patio11,,,"A minor heresy: most valuable programming involves a lot more gluing together libraries than it involves classical algorithms.  You can go <i>years</i> in industry without ever seeing anything more complex than a hash table, and you don't even need to know why hash tables work, really.  (And sorting?  Sorting gets done by calling list.sort(), not by coding a merge sort.)<p>1)  The way to go from ""dabbling"" to ""proficient"" is to ship software.  It doesn't have to be amazing software.  Entire industries are built on very non-amazing software.  You will learn more from writing and supporting 1 real application than you will from a hundred tutorials.<p>You are, from the perspective of 99% of people in the world, a magician.  Other people solve their problems by hand, by paper, by process, etc.  You can conjure demons, speak arcane words to them, and the problems <i>just go away</i>.  Find someone with a problem that they think is a Really Big Deal because they are not on speaking terms with any demons.  Speak to demons for them.  Get their money.  You'll learn a lot from the process -- in particular, how little speaking to demons is actually required of a demon-speaker.<p>2)  Study CS in college.  Study something else, too.  Your career prospects will not be dominated by your programming ability.  Restated for emphasis: your career prospects will not be dominated by your programming ability.  If you get really good at one hard thing plus programming, you're pretty much set for life (if that is your goal), since the intersection of the sets ""can do This Particular Hard Thing"" and ""can program"" will be only a handful of people.<p>3)  The really useful engineering classes are the ones that teach you how to interact with other people, in particular, how to interact with people who are not engineers.  People who are not engineers control most decisions you want made in your favor.  Look for courses like Technical Writing or Communication For Geeks or whatever and make a special effort to take those versus learning e.g. how to build microcomputers out of NAND gates.",1307932962

I think just about any academic curriculum aimed at application development starts off with basic console applications, works up to GUI apps, and then goes to the web. By then hopefully you see some patterns emerge that make learning new tech easier on you.<p>Then again, ironically, I did start to learn programming via the web through PHP, so I guess it can be done. The thing that helped me was that I already had a few years of experience working with static HTML, and I understood the problems PHP was trying to solve and felt the need for a solution myself. This was in the late 90s or early 2000s though, things were still a lot simpler back then than they are now. Websites didn't absolutely depend on JavaScript, you didn't have to know anything about AJAX, seeing CSS was fancy since having style information in your html was still common.<p>I don't know, if I think about learning all of it at once from scratch these days I want to vomit and have a seizure.

Do not, do not, <i>do not</i> assume that being a programming demigod is required to be a high-class consultant or that is even your primary source of value.<p>There are any number of folks who consult on things on HN, on everything from optimizing warehouse processes to pen testing Java web applications with obscure wire protocols to SEOing websites for software companies.  The common thread among those who make a lot of money is that their customers trust them to make them shedloads of money or avoid equivalent losses.<p>2)  I once read an interview with a wealth management professional on the secret to getting rich off regular labor, and his answer was interesting: ""Transactional work for rich people.""  To elaborate, if you're essentially  getting paid a portion of the transaction, you want to work for people whose transactions are huge.  Given that it takes virtually the same amount of work to sell a $2 million house and a $200,000 house, get the 7% off the pricier house.  Given that it takes essentially the same amount of work to write a SEO strategy for a company that has $20 million a year in revenue and one that has $20,000 a year in revenue, do it for the bigger company.<p>I get consulting gigs primarily because folks ask me to consult for them.  They typically know me from some combination of my blog, my Internet participation at watering holes like HN, or offline networking.  (Conferences and HN meetups have been very good to me, and I enjoy the heck out of them.)<p>By the way: I know this is probably blow-your-mind territory right now, but I wish somebody would have told me when I was a college freshman since it would have saved several years: $100 is not a high consulting rate.  People substantially less talented than you command multiples of it, for a variety of reasons.  For example, the <i>day</i> after you graduate, you could be billed out at $300 / hour by one of the large consulting firms like McKinsey.  That's probably a pathological example, but if you nail what McKinsey nails (giving clients the feeling that corporate money spent on them will ensure their personal career goals), you can also command rates that are substantially in excess of the numbers you are currently contemplating.",1307931266

A macro-system a-la Lisp (or Nemerle) could easily replace compiler plugins, and there is an active compiler plugin community so extensions to the compiler are desirable.

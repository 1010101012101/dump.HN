(Assuming you guys have, was it not used because the net tradeoff wasn&#x27;t worth it?)<p>It seems like if you&#x27;re already going through the effort to see if chunks have changed, you can readily do some heuristic where you check the end chunk of both sides, and scan inwards until you find a change; something to that respect, further minimize replicated data?  I&#x27;d assume you might have CPU cycles to spare, but I&#x27;m too far into assuming already to feel comfortable so I&#x27;ll just hope you answer :P  (thanks in advance, it&#x27;s been great to read what you&#x27;ve written thus far.)",1418777964

I wasn&#x27;t trying to tie it back to any particular scenario. Even in the absolute best case, the SSI program is clearly not about providing individual ROI for your tax dollars. It&#x27;s about your incremental work supporting others. Which is fine... <i>to a point</i>.<p>The &#x27;retained future income&#x27; portion of FICO payments, lets say with a 4% discount rate (ARR), is pennies on the dollar even in the best parts of the income curve where your earnings count the most toward achieving benefits.<p>Using &#x27;danans&#x27; numbers he came up with $35k of marginal utility from $115k of household income. Those numbers were obviously overly conservative, but did include an <i>average</i> SSDI of $24k. There are many, many benefits that danans did not include, which I enumerated in my reply downthread, but I&#x27;m willing to settle on $35k of utility from $115k of work as a starting point.<p>Now showing it without SSI/SSDI and just relying on food stamps, Medicaid, EITC, and other means-tested programs you still get horrible outcomes like the $24k - $30k example from &#x27;chipotle_coyote&#x27; but I agree it won&#x27;t be a straight-out loss up to $100k.<p>But I hear you -- if I believe enough in making an irrefutable point, I should just code up the site and accept pull requests on Github.<p>I have always shown my math and quoted my sources, so you might not agree with the methodology, but I&#x27;ve tried to be accurate with the numbers, and cite sources of inaccuracy where-ever possible.

The climate was changing due to human activity and shrinking of the Sun. Shit was getting serious and humanity needed a way to escape. The third planet from the Sun was chosen for seeding life into, due to it&#x27;s proximity to the star and life-supporting characteristics.<p>A ball of DNA was sent here to seed the planet. It contained the code for all living things, including humans with the source code for a consciousness able to evolve until it finds out the truth of creation.
And here we are, close to finding that out and able to continue what our ancestors left behind billions of years ago, before going extinct.
But that is only Step 1. Step 2 is finding out who seeded Mars and the Sun and the Universe. Might just be that it was us all along forever.

8760455,comment,8757630,8759877,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"<i>Except there is profit in that if one side has paid them to resolve the dispute badly.</i><p>Yes, you still need <i>some</i> trust that the mediator is not corrupt and actually knows how to resolve disputes. You obviously can&#x27;t pick someone completely at random. But, finding someone who is not corrupt and has specific domain knowledge is still easier than finding someone who is not corrupt, has specific domain knowledge AND is able to safely handle your money in escrow, which is what you&#x27;d require otherwise.<p>Trust isn&#x27;t a black and white thing. It&#x27;s a very complex and subtle topic. People can be trusted in some ways and not others.<p>Still, let&#x27;s take a look at how we can address your concern in ways that don&#x27;t involve funny attempts to arrange incentives via coin deposits and things (I was never keen on such protocols myself).<p>The simplest and most obvious way to avoid a corrupt mediator being paid off is to have a mediator who agrees to enforce some (mostly) predictable rules, instead of it being purely a matter of opinion. For example a mediator who offers to mediate mail order sales could publish the evidence they will use to resolve the dispute, and the act of making a payment involving them would involve effectively signing a contract with them (obviously you try and set up the software and contracts such that it&#x27;s pretty standardised and all done with one or two mouse clicks). Now the mediator has to produce not just a decision but also the rationale for how they arrived at that decision. If they can&#x27;t do that, the mediator will quickly gain a reputation as being unreliable and to be avoided.<p>This is the same approach as used by the courts. People take disputes in front of judges all the time, in the expectation that the judge is not corrupt. One reason they can reasonably expect this is that judges aren&#x27;t supposed to just pull an opinion out of their ass, they are supposed to show how they are applying and interpreting the law with references to other cases where there is ambiguity, or at least an understandable rationale for the decision when it genuinely strays into new territory.<p>Another way to reduce the trust needed in mediators is to use machines instead of people. This is the &quot;oracle&quot; concept described in the wiki page. The idea here is that a machine uses trusted computing to perform a <i>remote attestation</i> of the software it&#x27;s running. For example using Intel TXT / SGX, or AMD SKINIT. This lets you know how a dispute will be mediated with the precision of computer code. It can be a good approach if a contract or dispute is precise and measurable enough to be decided by programmatically, although again, these techniques are quite advanced and nobody is using them today.",1418776654

This agreement includes a &quot;session encryption key&quot;  that is completely random in the case of PFS (so it can&#x27;t be used to infer other session&#x27;s encryption keys, that&#x27;s the point). You then use this key for the whole duration of the session (with careful re-keying at some point otherwise it&#x27;s pointless)<p>PGP goes even beyond: there&#x27;s no session, and <i>each message</i> is encrypted with a different key. If you had to draw a parallel, it would be as if only one party is enough to decide the parameters of a session, and all parameters would still be changing every time. Also, each session is only ever used for 1 message. If you <i>really</i> want to draw the parallel, then PGP is the ultimate PFS.<p>> I actually wonder why we can&#x27;t just use Axolotl for an email interface, and call it a day?!<p>Because the number 1 problem in cryptography for a decentralized end-user product is <i>not</i> the cipher or the algorithms or <i>do we use Elliptic Curves</i> or whatever, it is <i>the distribution of keys</i>. The Axolotl ratchet is awesome, but it&#x27;s only a ratchet. PGP has some stuff related to key distribution and verification, TLS has some. If we are to implement global scale email cryptography, it will more likely be on top of PGP or TLS than anything else.",1418776215

8760420,comment,8755125,8755885,0,0,nathanwiebe,,,"Great question, the answer is that quantum oracles aren&#x27;t needed for the idea to work but in some cases it might be a really useful thing to have.  First off, just to be clear the idea of the algorithm is basically to use a quantum computer to directly sample from probability distributions that ordinary computers are stuck approximating.  However in order to do so, the algorithm has to interact with the data in some manner.  The quantum oracle really just serves as an abstraction for whatever method is used to input the data.<p>The first approach considered in the algorithm really doesn&#x27;t need a quantum oracle.  Since that algorithm only requires that you sequentially feed the input data you want to train the system with, you don&#x27;t need any sophisticated quantum algorithm to provide an entangled mixture of the data used to train the system.<p>The second algorithm we consider does use a quantum oracle (meaning a quantum device that allows the quantum computer to prepare an entangled mixture of input training examples).  In practice, if you have a database of training vectors (like MNIST handwriting images that you want to recognize) then you&#x27;d need to make a giant quantum computer that stores all of this and allows quantum access to this.  This could be done using a QRAM (although not all quantum computer designs have efficient QRAM).<p>Alternatively, the quantum oracle could be any other quantum algorithm that you want to learn about.  One idea that I&#x27;m a little obsessed with is the idea of using a quantum simulation subroutine as the quantum oracle.  Then this approach allows you to train a deep Boltzmann machine to learn features of the system that the subroutine is simulating.  Ideas like this could really accelerate drug testing and development by using AI and quantum simulation simultaneously to focus in on promising candidate drugs without requiring as much trial and error as current methods.",1418775752

But when you&#x27;re doing legal research, a lower-court case that directly addresses your issue but isn&#x27;t widely cited is much more valuable than a highly-cited Supreme Court case that doesn&#x27;t address your issue.<p>This is true where you are doing fine-grained research, but there are plenty of lawyers who are constantly delving into new areas of law that are adjacent to or tangential to their primary area of interest or practice. When this happens, it can be phenomenally useful to get up to speed on the area of law by seeing which decisions have the highest PageRank, or PageRank weighted by certain factors, etc.<p>In this way, one way to think about the startup that implements a PageRank algorithm is that it is not disrupting electronic legal research, but rather disrupting legal textbooks. In my experience, the fastest way to get abreast of a new field is to find the leading textbook. One could imagine a sophisticated database which could altogether remove the need to consult a textbook by painting a picture of the leading cases, key pieces of legislation, which sections are most often referred by which cases in which context, etc.",1418774485

Last month a large client of ours called our managed support team at 3AM saying they hired the wrong developer who completely trashed their database and hosed their entire application. They had their own backup system in place and it silently failed, but luckily they ordered our internal backup solution as a secondary. We were able to get them restored in 5 minutes, if they didn&#x27;t have our solution in place they would&#x27;ve had to spend weeks fixing what the developer broke.<p>Current Linux backup solutions are not made for humans. Have a look at the mondorescue guide[1], nobody is going to read that and comprehend it with full mastery, meaning you&#x27;re leaving yourself open to losing data. VPS providers offer backups that are usually in the same datacenter, which means you&#x27;re SOL if there&#x27;s a disaster. Those same providers also don&#x27;t allow you to restore single files/directories from snapshots, usually you have to launch a new instance or revert everything back to snapshot.<p>We ended up creating a simple Linux backup solution[2] that&#x27;s as simple as copying and pasting a single command to get installed, notifies you if your backups aren&#x27;t running, handles snapshots, and is secure. Restoring your data is a single command away, so you can focus instead on building your startup rocketship. Our mission is to make data loss a thing of the past.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mondorescue.org/docs/mondorescue-howto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondorescue.org/docs/mondorescue-howto.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://jarvys.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jarvys.io</a>",1418774471

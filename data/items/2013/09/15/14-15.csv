6389228,comment,6388714,6388714,6,0,bane,,,"On some level, college sports programs exist to train students how to be professional sportspeople (which includes things like becoming a professional middle school sports coach). No different, conceptually, than any other major. The fact that supply <i>far</i> outstrips demand just means lots of college sports students end up doing different jobs out of school, just like a creative writing major might end up working in an unrelated field.<p>But sports are weird and mysterious to me. They seem to integrate so strongly into people&#x27;s identities that they&#x27;re willing to overlook any number of rational issues with them. At times it becomes downright bizarre and cultish - Penn State football. I think sports are mildly interesting, but nowhere interesting enough to have the esteemed place of prominence that it has in the educational system.<p>When I was growing up, I studied in my school&#x27;s music program, and I remember attending many school board meetings where we had to justify our existence to receive any funding at all. We squeaked by with a combination of reducing budget, bake sales, corporate donations and a teacher going unpaid for a semester. And there were other challenges, ancient equipment, incomplete scores and no money to buy more (outfitting a 100 piece orchestra with music to read off of is very expensive) and on and on. We got very good at fundraising.<p>Meanwhile the school sports teams got new uniforms for free every season (music kids had to either provide their own instruments or rent them from the school), equipment was mostly new, regular morning announcements let people know about sporting related events, the school newspaper was 40-50% dedicated to the sports teams and students were forced en masse to attend rallies for the sports team in the middle of the academic day. When I was there my 30 year old school got a new state of the art stadium that occupied several acres of school property. They claimed it was to support all of the students, but it was only ever used for sporting events.<p>Support to the music program? Not once in middle or high school was an upcoming music program event mentioned on the morning announcements, and only one time that I can recall did the school paper mention a music program -- it was to let everybody know that an exchange program hosted by the music program was underway and we were about to have a bunch of foreign students attending classes with us. Students were encouraged to make nice nice with the foreign kids and invite them to sporting events to make them feel welcome.<p>When my school&#x27;s orchestra won a prestigious national competition it was never announced and the trophy we won wasn&#x27;t allowed to mix with the sports trophies in the school&#x27;s trophy case. So it sat in the music teacher&#x27;s office, which was a converted janitorial room. Our yearbooks had 30 pages dedicated to action shots for the school&#x27;s sports teams, the music program (4 orchestras, 3 bands and 2 choirs) had to jam onto one page. Our national win was cut in editing.<p>Like most high schools the cheerleaders and football players were minor celebrities able to get away with any number of school infractions including physical violence and property destruction against music program kids and their instruments.<p>I hated school sports teams.<p>One of the reasons I went to the college I went to was that it had no well known sports team and the President of the college refused to fund a stronger sports program citing research like the OPs that it was a waste of money for the schools. Our sports arena was more likely to be used for circus performances and concerts than basketball or hockey.<p>I agreed with his stance and secretly enjoyed watching the sports program kids learning how to raise equipment funds and fight for notice like the arts kids had to do.<p>And then he retired, his replacement poured money into the sports program and in a couple of years one of them made it into a national tournament. The sports program exploded, new teams were added, sports pavilions were added, practice fields were cut out of wooded parts of the campus.<p>I hated that once again, sports were finding this kind of irrational support.<p>And then...almost overnight my school went from being a virtually unknown to the largest one in the state with individual schools getting ranked in the top 10 in the country. Money and endowments started flooding in, new performing arts centers, science, tech and R&D buildings started construction. Entire new dormitory blocks sprang up. Two, all new, state of the art sports centers opened up and were opened to the local community. Why? The school president was able to spin the sports teams success into money raising (fund raising, donations, loans) opportunities to invest in every other aspect of the school.<p>So...I think I learned a powerful lesson. Sure sports look like a parasite on schools, sucking out way more then they appear to immediately return. But used as a tool, the new president was able to benefit the entire school in ways his predecessor could never have dreamed of. So yeah, I feel a sense of school pride, and while it&#x27;s not <i>about</i> the sports teams, I have to recognize that it&#x27;s <i>because</i> of the sports teams.",1379256435
6389227,comment,6388634,6388634,5,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I&#x27;ve ran across this topic on 3 occasions in the last week in various forms: online, with a team, and on a LinkedIn board. Wow, must be something in the air.<p>So here&#x27;s the short version:<p>1) Agile relationships with customers boil down to Time and Materials. You&#x27;re there working sprint-by-sprint doing stuff. Each sprint the customer and the team agrees on what it can do. The team decides, but the customer can always fire them. This isn&#x27;t estimation, this is just how an Agile engagement is supposed to work.<p>2) Most Agile teams split estimating into two parts: how difficult it is to deliver, and when it can be done. It&#x27;s important to understand that by separating these concepts, you&#x27;re not pressured to make time commitments when spitballing story difficulty. That&#x27;s a good thing. Decouple those concepts and leave them decoupled.<p>3) As a trailing indicator, you should use past team performance as an estimate of how the big picture is going to play out. [insert long discussion here about the various ways to do that]<p>4) None of this is business or contract management. That&#x27;s another can of worms. Yes, it all gets mixed up sometimes, but there are ways to keep visibility at the right level to let all the players work effectively.<p>5) None of this will make-up for working in a crappy environment. Sucky situations still suck.<p>Estimating can be a pain in the ass, but it doesn&#x27;t have to be. I <i>think</i> we&#x27;ve reached the point where most of the pain is gone if you set the environment up the correct way. (fingers crossed)<p>Shameless plug: I&#x27;ve got a no-nonsense Agile Tune-Up email series in case anybody&#x27;s interested. It covers estimation (along with many other Agile team topics) <a href=""http://bit.ly/15sz0Pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/15sz0Pl</a><p>ADD: As you can tell from the many comments, this is also a topic that has been done to death. There are more methods out there than you can shake a stick at. (Hence my reluctance to dive in with &quot;This is the perfect way to estimate!&quot;). But the key takeaway is this: <i>lots of simple, quick estimates that converge over time beat any kind of complex model done only once</i>. If you only get one thing, that&#x27;s the thing to understand. We keep trying to &quot;fix&quot; this by creating models, when the real answer is that over time the team learns to estimate each project as a separate entity. The more engaged it is with the problem and the farther along it is, the better the estimates get. It&#x27;s a funnel. Don&#x27;t spend a lot of effort trying to polish up the first part of the funnel: rather, make a commitment to using empirical knowledge and re-estimating to provide better and better estimates as you go along. There&#x27;s a lot more value added to everybody&#x27;s job that way.<p>Hell, I don&#x27;t care if you use KLOC, some kind of FPA, phases of the moon, or your lucky astrology mood watch to estimate, as long as you continue to re-estimate as you go along and your estimates quickly converge on the actual result.",1379256431

Flights are cheap to anywhere in the region and there are a lot of interesting places nearby.<p>So, use your house or apartment as your home base and then take lots of vacations.<p>Even just living abroad can get old though. After a number of years you wonder why you are doing it. What&#x27;s the point? You begin to find out what really matters in life, which to me is family, my craft and... food!

If you&#x27;re at college (anywhere) and were attracted there as a sports fan, you&#x27;d probably still be in college elsewhere if not for the sports, and you&#x27;d probably be there for more acadmically valid reasons.

Instead of responding to each individual comment, let me just note two things.<p>First, my post was not intended to be general advice to employees of all companies on how to handle a situation where they&#x27;re starting to look for jobs.  Of course, many environments would not respond well to that approach.  My point was just that that&#x27;s how we encourage employees to handle the situation at Return Path, and we have created a safe environment to do so.  By the way, it doesn&#x27;t happen here 100% of the time either, by any stretch of the imagination.  But I wish it did.  When it happens, it&#x27;s better for everyone -- the company as well as the employee, who either (a) ends up staying because we resolve some issue we weren&#x27;t aware of, or (b) has a less stressful and more graceful transition out.<p>Second, the way we run our business is around a bit of a social contract -- that is to say, a two-way street.  And just as we ask employees to start a dialog with us when they are thinking of leaving, we absolutely, 100% of the time, are open and transparent with employees when they are in danger of being fired (other than the occasional urgent &quot;for cause&quot; situation).  We give people ample opportunity to correct performance and even fit issues.  In terms of someone&#x27;s question below about lay-offs, we fortunately haven&#x27;t had to do those since 2001, but if I recall, even then, we were extremely transparent about our financial position and that we might need to cut jobs in 30 days.<p>Happy to jump in on other comments as well or respond individually at matt at returnpath dot com.",1379254557

There is, however, a social cost to not being on FB, especially if your social circle is not technologically adept. A salient example: An old friend of mine (like many people, I gather) has gradually slipped into a mode where she uses FB exclusively for electronic communication. She no longer checks her email accounts. She only uses FB messaging and FB status updates to keep in touch with her friends. In today&#x27;s &quot;simplify your life&quot; culture (which I think is a good thing, generally) she has pared down her electronic footprint to a single service, FB. Recently I discovered through a mutual friend (over email) that my friend&#x27;s mother is basically dying of cancer, she has travelled back home to be with her mother, etc etc. I didn&#x27;t know any of this because I&#x27;m not on FB, and FB is where my friend chose to inform everyone, keep everyone up to date on progress, appeal for donations, organize social events, etc. Sure, I could be in touch by telephone, and obviously I wasn&#x27;t ... but what if your friend(s) are not really phone people? I guess the point of this comment is, what if your friends are FB people? If you choose not to be, there is a social cost. Having said all that, I still will not establish a (new) FB account.

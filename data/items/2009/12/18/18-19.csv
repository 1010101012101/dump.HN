I wonder if it would sound as good if you were to be more concrete.<p>In particular, would you mention (or, at least, loosely characterize by subsystem or specification) some of the bugs in IE that you would consider a higher priority?<p>I'm asking because all of the following appear fundamental to me:  DOM Traversal, DOM Range, DOM2 Core, DOM2 Events, DOM2 Views, DOM2 Style, CSS3 selectors, ECMAScript conformance & garbage collection, the behavior of HTML forms when manipulated by script, the HTTP 1.1 Protocol...<p>I admit that there are 4 tests for SVG and 2 for SMIL that could be placed at a much lower priority, and if IE were sitting at 94/100 for missing those then I might agree with you.  (Those were among the bucket 5 tests that arrived via the contest.)",1261162757

1003689,comment,1003065,1003185,0,0,gwern,,,"Novamente is written in Java and is in the symbolic/probabilistic vein of AGI schemes. From very loose and unsourced scuttlebut I have heard from time to time that performance has been an issue. To go out on a limb, I would venture a guess that it has a lot of possible optimizations which are too difficult for a compiler but would eat up a lot of programmer time and hinder the extreme flexibility and changeability that Novamente would need, and so a smarter optimizer would be of considerable interest to Goertzel.<p>On the other hand, program optimization in general has been called an AI-complete problem (<a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/AI-complete"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/AI-complete</a>), so maybe the reason is the other way around.",1261162519

On the other hand, when facebook changed the default privacy settings, they put a giant-ass unmistakable pop-up message telling you about this and literally did not let you access the rest of the site until you had read about it. And the old privacy settings are still available.<p>I trust facebook not to give away more information than I tell them to, because when they got burned for that before they reacted well and learned from their mistakes.

I went into a huge depression and stopped attending classes.  Tulane cut my degree program, so I switched to Philosophy.  Started drinking heavily.  My grades plummeted.  22 hours from graduating, I found a job doing random tech things (some LAMP stack administration, help desk work, etc.) so I quit school.<p>My first year on the job I was highly unmotivated and did just the bare minimum of work required, but the second year (thanks in large part to an amazing boss), I really started to get active developing in php.  I realized that development was what I really enjoyed doing, and then I became a voracious learner.  I read every book I could get my hands on about software development, design patterns, frameworks.  A year after that I was doing primarily OOP php work, and now I'm in the process of developing my startup while keeping my day job.  (I also lost a bunch of weight and became a workout fanatic - that really helped with the depression and alcoholism thing - trying to lift while drunk is a terrible experience)<p>I think I will go back and finish up <i>a</i> degree.  There's a social stigma that goes along with not having a bachelors.  ""Oh, he wasn't smart enough for college.""  But in terms of helping me achieve my life goals?  I don't think it's at all necessary, as long as you keep on learning and doing.",1261159380

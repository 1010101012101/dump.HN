How do you tell the difference between &quot;vigorous debate&quot; and a &quot;flame war&quot;? If the algorithm utilized NLP to analyze the tenor of the discussion, that would be one thing, but upvotes vs. comment count is a troubling metric. I <i>want</i> to read threads where people are passionately discussing a topic with long back-and-forth debates. If that&#x27;s a &quot;flame war&quot; then I&#x27;d like more flame wars, please.",1406599175

(After all, even ultra-precise, mostly apolitical subjects like physics and chemistry often have trouble with replication.) The untrustworthiness of empirical evidence in social science makes deduction especially important.<p>In the case of sex differences, we need only one empirical result to determine the null hypothesis: male and female members of <i>H. sapiens</i> have different reproductive incentives. The null hypothesis then follows from an application of simple logic. That I <i>do</i> find convenient.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean the null hypothesis is always correct, of course. For example, there is strong evidence that mean IQ for men and women is virtually the same, which suggests the null hypothesis in this case is wrong. Neither need the null hypothesis conform to a &quot;sexist&quot; narrative; e.g., credible studies in cognitive neuroscience show that women are better on average at multitasking and verbal fluency. But the entire mainstream is committed to marginalizing the null hypothesis whenever it contradicts the politically correct narrative, logic be damned.<p>You are evidently a supporter of the mainstream, which is why you deride my [use of mathematical notation](<a href=""https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/493116213803757568"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/tqbf/status/493116213803757568</a>) instead of addressing the content of my comment.

Of course, many won&#x27;t because owning a car isn&#x27;t purely a financial decision and humans change slowly.<p>Discussions and imagination move much faster than reality but the world will catch up.<p>Technical note: The price per hour should be (time-related depreciation)/miles + hourly wage divided by the utilization rate. Mileage should be the sum of fuel costs per mile, maintenance cost per mile, and mileage based depreciation.<p>Running these numbers for a driver expecting $20 per hour (Average for a Taxi driver is ~$12) with 2/3 utilization and driving a Prius yields a pricing structure of ~$0.60 per minute and ~$0.20 per mile.",1406597807

I would say the main difference you will find is mostly at a DSL level. I find that bitcoinjs has nicer syntax than bitcore.<p>Bitcore has a fairly loose syntax. And a function can takes many different types of argument. As an example:<p><a href=""https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/lib/HierarchicalKey.js#L17-L54"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/lib/Hierarchic...</a><p>If you pass no argument, it defaults to a new BIP32 key on mainnet. Or you can pass in a network argument, or you can pass in a string private key.<p>Bitcoinjs-lib on the other hand, enforces fairly strict typing on functions. Functions often only take one particular type, as an example: <a href=""https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/hdnode.js#L73-L75"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/blob/master/src/h...</a><p>This function only takes a string key in base58 format.<p>In my experience of using both, it is easy to have programmer error in bitcore, because its syntax is so loose. Whereas it is a lot harder to make programmer errors in bitcoinjs-lib. Given that this is financial software, I prefer the bitcoinjs-lib approach.<p>For example, One problem I encountered with bitcore was I made a mistake in the derivation path of a bip32 key. Instead path of &#x27;M/1/0/1&#x27;, I mistakenly used &#x27;M/1/0/1/undefined&#x27;. Bitcore happily derived a key for me.

A portion of the 75% would fail to have the conversation due to... mutually insufficient interest in making the conversation happen.  (Flakiness suggests the prospect is at fault.  I would suggest that the prospect is, like you, a busy businessman, and that failure to follow up is most likely not intended to communicate &quot;We are pursuing other options&quot; but rather &quot;Oh, crikey, I forgot about that among the 100 things I had to do this week.&quot;  The successful consultant will learn to follow up with prospects and get them to say Yes or No explicitly rather than having that introverted fear of bothering somebody make one convince oneself that they&#x27;ve been rejected.

For example, most startups are not in a great position to require my services or, to be blunt, in a position to pay for them.  If one hypothetically sent me a cold email out of the blue, and I had consulting availability, I&#x27;d research/ask to figure out whether they were at a certain level of success/sophistication, whether the person contacting had decisionmaking authority, and whether they had high five figures in the budget prior to having a sales talk.

If your example was to be represented it would be 22-byte in length which is outside the bounds available — granted that I took the number of X literally and could be shortened multiple ways.<p>Moreover, the UUID is described as a region identifier where, in your scenario, all the beacons for the bus company would have the same region identifier but each individual beacon representing a stop would have an individual major and minor identifier (2-byte each) to uniquely identify that particular stop. So the way in which the iBeacon spec and somewhat AltBeacon are authored don&#x27;t really allow for that kind of implementation because of the limitations imposed by the small advertising packet space. Its intended that the identifier space be used for something like a UUID with a set of supporting identifiers (major, minor).<p>As you can see from the AltBeacon spec diagram; there is only 28-bytes available for advertisable data on a Bluetooth Smart peripheral.

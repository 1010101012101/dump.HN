If we are what we think/read then it would be a great starting point in finding cofounders or people who are on the same wavelength. \n\nI would also agree on seeing the latest comments - and maybe highlighting posts which you've commented on/ or submitted showing if there were new comments that you haven't read. So show &#34;7 comments | 3 new&#34; so it would be easy to come back to your home page and see how the discussion has evolved.  ",1172144710

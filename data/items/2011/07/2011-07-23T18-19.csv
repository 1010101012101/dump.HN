One would continue into the ant colony style civilization and another is space bound. One of the natural dividers emerging now is ""either one is an accessory to the computer(and all its consumer oriented entertainment) or the computer is an accessory(i.e. tool for further exploration and development) to the one"", and that would become even more pronounced with further development of even more effective (ie. direct connection) human(brain) to machine interfaces.",1311447502
2797525,comment,2797432,2797432,10,0,ForrestN,,,"I think this is an interesting idea with some potential. Good job building something for people!<p>I'm sure you're not at this stage yet, but the best way I can add value is to offer a few design notes as you move forward:<p>- The alignment, especially around the form, is sort of wonky. ""E-mail"" is separated to two lines (at least in Chrome), and the ""Schedule for delivery"" button is neither left aligned or center aligned. The e-mail field is also way longer than necessary for an e-mail address.<p>- There is a bit of dissonance between the old-looking, message-in-a-bottle font and the highly rounded edges of the forms. I'm not sure which direction is better, but it seems like it might be better to either go for tech-looking or aged-looking than splitting the difference in this way.<p>- The background, which is a not-great quality, black and white photo of a woman in a bikini, is distracting and strange whichever direction you go in. I guess the beach is where you find messages in a bottle, but it just feels very confusing and distracting from the core product.<p>- The name, FutureMessage.me, made me assume that I was going to send myself a message. If I can, and am even prompted to, send a message to someone else, there is no future message being sent to me. I read the name like ""message me"", as in ""send me a message."" I don't think this is a big problem, but it's definitely not as good as it could be.<p>- I was able to enter a non e-mail, ""asdf asdf asdf"" and schedule a message. I wasn't given any feedback on the thanks page telling me the address, so if I mistyped an invalid email, I might end up waiting for 6 months and not getting anything. Would add a bit more polish to correct invalid email accounts, and also to confirm the email on the thanks page.<p>- The thanks page is obviously thrown together and doesn't make much sense. I don't understand who the person is, and why he relates.<p>- The explanatory text isn't very strong. Coming to the site, I get what it does, but I don't understand why I would want to use it. At least for me, I didn't have a response like ""finally, I can send myself a randomly timed message!"" I think it would help if you fleshed out some ideas for usage, something to hook me in and think ""yeah, that's something I'd want to set up.""<p>- I'd work on the colors. The all grayscale with just the two words in fire-engine red is sort of harsh and doesn't look very appealing.<p>- The stream-of-consciousness stuff at the end is interesting, but might need to be adapted into another form. I think you've started to reflect on what might be interesting about your tool, but I don't think you're communicating those reflections very well.<p>- The tagline, ""Messages to the Future"", doesn't add much to the name. It might be good to rewrite this.<p>- Because it's so simple, there's no reason to use so much vertical space. I should be able to use the tool without scrolling like I do now on my laptop.<p>- Having the background on the wrapper and pushing the wrapper to the left makes the grey background on the right look just like dead space. Either center the wrapper, or find a better way of relating the backgrounds.<p>- After making the more important changes, go over carefully the spacing and padding of the different elements to make it look harmonious. As an example, the space between the name (which shouldn't have a colon) and the tagline doesn't look right.<p>Keep up the good work!",1311447449

2797494,comment,2797261,2797464,16,0,goodside,,,"That's not how it works. If we observe an object that's currently 12 billion lightyears away (i.e., its co-moving distance is 12 billion light years) the light we observe was emitted much less than 12 billion years ago. While light is in transit, both the distances ahead and behind it will increase due to Hubble expansion, so once you get up to cosmic scales like these the normal distance/velocity formulas don't apply.<p>In general, if you point a flashlight into space and wait one year, the distance between you and the photons of light will be <i>slightly</i> higher than one lightyear. As you wait longer, this difference becomes less slight. When you get up to much larger scales (billions of lightyears) the Hubble expansion dominates the equations.<p>In the most extreme cases, you get counterintuitive things popping up like distances that are so large they can't be traversed in any amount of time, even at light speed. Until you're using equations that make that seem natural, you shouldn't rely intuitive calculations from NASA press releases like this.

One might argue that the main purpose of government is to provide an aggregate benefit to society that would otherwise not occur due to coordination, efficiency of scale (lack thereof), tragedy of the commons, and other issues.<p>For example, in this particular case, even if consumers wanted these bikes / bike stations, it might never happen if the company relied on consumer sponsorship.  Who's going to pay for such a service when there's only a handful of stations and bikes?  But how is the company going to get a ton of bikes / install a bunch of stations without customers?  Of course, raising money is one way, but selling to a customer that (in theory) represents the entire population (and has some of their money) is another.<p>Not saying that in this instance, the government is not incompetent/derelict beyond all belief - all I am is saying is that you can't say a company isn't providing something people want <i>just</i> because they're selling to government.  In order to be able to do that, you'd have to first show that the government in question is completely broken in that it <i>never</i> provides things that are beneficial to society, which the author has not (maybe the U.S. government is close, but I doubt many would assert that it is 100% broken).",1311446186

OCaml is OO, and it's one of the most functional languages I know (the other being Haskell). Scala is a functional language and an OO language (and an imperative language, as a matter of fact). Clojure could also be considered OO, with the new protocols. Javascript is a very OO language, and quite functional as well (especially considering the libraries such as Underscore). Maybe we should be talking about functional and imperative programming styles instead, imperative being a loop, and functional being a recursive function (map, filter, fold/reduce).<p>> declarativity instead of an imperative style of programming<p>I guess there's a thin line separating these concepts, and also a great deal of overlap and confusion. Here, we're declaring what we want:<p><pre><code>  even = [i from nats[1:100] where i % 2 == 0]

Here, we're using ""the imperative style"":<p><pre><code>  even = []
  for i = 1 to 100
    if i % 2 == 0
      even.append(i)
</code></pre>
This is functional style:<p><pre><code>  even = filter(nats[1:100], i -> i % 2 == 0)
</code></pre>
However, this is also imperative - we're telling the computer what to do. The main difference is just that in the ""imperative style"", we're dealing with elements, while functional style is focused around sequences.<p>On the other hand, these concepts and expressions are used with so many different meanings and in so many different contexts, that it's no surprise that different people understand them differently.

Would it not be more efficient to just say &quot;don&#x27;t bother recycling anything except metal, glass, and #1 or #2 plastic.&quot; The rest can be trucked directly to the landfill, saving the extra trip and energy used to take it to the MRF for sorting.<p>I think there&#x27;s a good bit of political deceptiveness going on, people like to think that they are recycling and helping the environment so local government sets up a program to make it appear that they are.

Or a mix of &quot;stressed desserts&quot; repeated in different ways 100 times? And also what of the phrases before and after &quot;stressed/desserts,&quot; how do you place them since you are not sure about the order/orientation of this repeat?<p>This is the challenge of genome assembly. Now having more copies of the shredded document helps but some repeats are very nasty and aligning them in the assembly is not statistically tractable. And also they don&#x27;t necessarily encode for relevant genes so they are often filtered out. Furthermore, they are arguably the regions of the DNA that is the most prone to change, since you can think of them as the &quot;filler text&quot; of the document; if an important part of the document is unintelligible, then this document wouldn&#x27;t survive nature&#x27;s QC process of sexual selection. However, unintelligible parts of the document don&#x27;t encode important genes, so they evolve very quickly because they have a higher tolerance of typo&#x27;s and mutations.<p>So in an population pool that people use to assemble and come up with an consensus genome (keep in mind the population pool will have different gene variation), so it may turn out at a particular base pair position in the document, there is so much variation that the genome assembler can&#x27;t conclusively come up with an consensus sequence or a reasonable distribution of base pair (A, T, C, G).",1449369568

Heller:<p>> The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be rephrased, “Because a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.”<p>> Although this structure of the Second Amendment is unique in our Constitution, other legal documents of the founding era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state constitutions, commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose. [...] [A]part from [its] clarifying function, a prefatory clause does not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause.<p>The court also examined the meaning of the word &quot;militia&quot;. The word had a different meaning at the time than it does today. The militia did not refer to a specific military force, like the National Guard today. Rather, it referred to a section of the populace:<p>> As we will describe below, the “militia” in colonial America consisted of a subset of “the people”—those who were male, able bodied, and within a certain age range. Reading the Second Amendment as protecting only the right to “keep and bear Arms” in an organized militia therefore fits poorly with the operative clause’s description of the holder of that right as “the people.”<p>> We start therefore with a strong presumption that the Second Amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all Americans.",1449369045

Service state. The author essentially requests master-slave promotion. Corosync/pacemaker is an excellent place to look for well tested solutions here. The normal approach used there is superior to the author&#x27;s, ie. a floating IP used by all clients is switched to an already live replacement master, which is first jabbed in to action, and which shares the same backing storage as the nodes which has failed. (A great solution for shared backing storage on standard hardware is DRBD)<p>2. MySQL update. Change management with SOA has to be far more rigid due to complex interdependencies. Typically you version your entire service, exhaustively test it against peer services, and only then deploy the updated service. This implies a workflow process more formalized than the series of manual operations the author hand-waves about. That said, in a typical database scenario it is often possible to upgrade across minor versions simply by updating the binary, since it will read the old on-disk database store fine.<p>3. Heartbleed. With an appropriately automated approach to service builds, this should be trivial. Mask the affected packages or versions, rebuild all services, test and deploy. This really goes back again to overall workflow formalization and automation. (Solid infrastructure would have cryptographic signoff on stuff before it runs, eg. production demands a signature from test infrastructure that all tests have passed before executing a new service)<p>4. Service dependencies. This is far more complex than people assume. My advice is to use corosync/pacemaker, a well tested approach. (There are others)<p>5. Hadoop. Same as any other service.<p>There are many other problems with SOA-type infrastructure automation; some ideas I wrote up ages ago can be seen at <a href=""http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stani.sh/walter/pfcts/</a> as well as the sketch/documentation of the solution I built.",1449368817

If you&#x27;re going inboard with driveshafts you might as well put a differential in there and be able to put more than 50% (2wd) or 25%(4wd) of power to one wheel. Putting a motor in each wheel means you can only direct power around by reducing it.",1449367532

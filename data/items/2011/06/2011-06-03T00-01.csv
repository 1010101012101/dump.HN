2614723,comment,2613271,2614699,6,0,etherael,,,"All currency values ever are completely speculative, the value of a currency is a shared mass consensual hallucination, this even applies to gold. There is no innate reason that it should ever have been considered as a form of money except by the consent of those that offered and accepted it as such. Bitcoin is no exception to this, but that is largely irrelevant with regards to the realities on the ground of how people are currently trading <i>with</i> btc rather than trading <i>in</i> btc.<p>Those trading <i>with</i> btc just want a fast digital medium of exchange, they have taken to pricing their goods and services in a local fiat currency with more stability than btc (which is pretty much anything with the extreme market swings in btc right now) and a proviso that the conversion will be done at the time of the transaction. So, effectively they are simply treating BTC like cash. Due to the superfluidity of the exchange itself they can afford to ignore the actual exchange rate.<p>Those trading <i>in</i> btc are hoarding it with the expectation that the price will rise as scarcity increases due to other people speculating in it as well as the network hash rate of the mining effort spiralling upward.<p>These two points taken together was the core of my hypothetical idea about buying / selling agents that are effectively exchanges coupled with merchant service providers. It reflects the reality on the ground and plays well with both sectors of the market.<p>Just to answer the obvious points also, something you can print on your inkjet when you're twelve is also printable by any other inkjet holder. The BTC in your account are unique and the total supply of BTC is expanded by a well understood mathematical process at a predictable rate and distribution, not fiat declaration of a central bank. This is what is meant by bitcoin is not a fiat currency.<p>I also have enlightening perspective changing quotations from jesuits saved up just in case, and I am a militant atheist.<p>I guess I'm just weird like that. :)",1307062467

2614718,comment,2613774,2614600,9,0,9999,,,"A well known cracker named George Hotz (GeoHot), best known for iPhone jailbreaking, began to target the PS3's security to enable full access to the PS3's graphics capabilities via the Linux install option that the PS3 originally shipped with.  Sony was concerned that that would enable piracy, so they removed the Linux install option in a firmware update.<p>If you refused to install that firmware update, you could continue using your PS3 with that Linux installation, but you wouldn't be able to play new games or potentially play online.  Basically, compute clusters that relied on that install continued working, and continue to work today.<p>The removal of that option incensed many PS3 purchasers, tech writers, hackers, etc.  George Hotz then went on to crack the PS3's security anyway, enabling arbitrary code to run on the device (including applications that would let you run pirated PS3 games).  Sony sued Hotz, ostensibly because he enabled massive piracy.  This further incensed  varied and sundry ""hacking"" organizations which began to target Sony.  Eventually, Sony dropped the case against Hotz, for reasons that are difficult to discern (bad publicity for the most part).  At this point, various hacking groups were able to penetrate the Playstation Network as well as many other Sony properties, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of lost income at this point.",1307062342

I'll omit their insistence on promoting their own products over other standards and general push for increased DRM, such as Minidisc/ATRAC, Blu-ray, etc. and focus on their actual attacks.<p>It started with the CD root kit fiasco, in which music CDs distributed by Sony infected Windows PCs with software designed to prevent the ripping of music CDs to the computer, which also contained exploitable holes used by malware to infect computers.<p>Sony then removed the Other OS (e.g. Linux) feature from the new version of its PS3 consoles.  This wasn't too egregious, but next they retroactively removed Other OS from older consoles that originally supported it.  That upset a lot of people.<p>Along came GeoHot, a reverse engineer determined to get Other OS back, and no doubt other less-outspoken hackers.  So he and the others did, and along with it recovered Sony's private key used to sign PS3 software, allowing Linux to access all the hardware of the PS3, as well as running other homebrew software.<p>Less-scrupulous individuals, not including GeoHot himself, used the aforementioned work to run pirated software on the PS3.  This upset Sony.<p>The straw that broke the camel's back, though, was Sony suing GeoHot into oblivion (I personally suspect they also astroturfed gaming sites to get GeoHot's hack associated with cheaters at Call of Duty, which it was not).  This is the final event that triggered the misguided but potent onslaught of attacks against any and all Sony properties.<p>References:<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy_protection_rootkit_scandal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sony_BMG_copy...</a><p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/PlayStation_3#Private_key_compromised"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/PlayStation_3...</a><p>[Edit: fixed botched pronoun after partial sentence rewrite]",1307061835

Wouldn't that be the case for all small businesses?<p>It's almost instinctual for people to want to share things that have played a part -- large or small -- in adding to their quality of life. That being said, I don't think it depends on the what type of service the small biz offers, nor the audience that it panders to. Especially not the latter because whether you're selling aardvarks or zyzzyvas, if someone enjoyed their experience purchasing said aardvark or zyzzvya, they'll naturally be inclined to share.<p>That being said, I'm not exactly sure your last question fits into the equation. Even if the small biz generated most of its clients through mediums like direct mail and the like, that fact alone makes little impact on if the small biz should advertise via social media platforms like Facebook.<p>The question really boils down to whether or not Facebook ads (being that they're display based) is a better option for small businesses over Adwords, due to the inherent fact that Adwords allows the small biz owner to target specific keywords that essentially act as pre-sell for whatever product or service they offer.<p>I see a lot of small businesses advertising on Facebook, but mostly for businesses that are no where near where I live. A lot of people would quote the fact that there aren't many small businesses advertising on Facebook as evidence that Facebook is not a good platform for generating customers. I'd say that's more because people are unaware of how to successfully create Facebook ad campaigns to generate those customers than anything.",1307060940

Biology does this sort of thing all the time -- that's where it gets a lot of its power -- but this kind of simplified logic is easier for humans.<p>Looking over the paper, it looks like they figured out how to combine their seesaw gates and thresholding gates into AND and OR gates, then from there, used dual-rail asynchronous logic to make a four-bit square root calculator. They can't make NOT gates (or NAND, or NOR), so each bit gets two ""wires"", holding opposite values; this lets them make arbitrary logic without NOT operations.<p>There's a pretty slick simulator program you can play with here, along with more information, if anybody's interested:<p><a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dna/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dna/</a>",1307059902

2614592,comment,2613407,2613407,21,0,hncommenter13,,,"One important item that hasn't received a lot of attention is Groupon's ""Accrued Merchant Payable.""  If you'll indulge me, a longish thought experiment (yes, it relates to Groupon).<p>Imagine a sandwich shop that allowed customers to purchase future sandwiches--buy one today at a 50% discount, eat it sometime in the future.  The sandwich shop would receive $3 for a sandwich for which it normally charges $6, and it would owe me a sandwich at a future date.  Also assume the sandwich costs the shop $1.50 in direct costs (50% margins at a $3 price).<p>This proves to be a popular promotion with the shop's customers.  The shop sells lots of $3 ""sandwich rights,"" bringing in $3 in cash up front.  It spends a good deal of that $3 in cash to pay ongoing expenses and to get the word out about its 50% off sandwich deal.<p>But then the growth of its ""sandwich rights"" business slows.  Other sandwich shops offer a better deal--$2 for a $6 sandwich--and it begins to saturate the market of local lunch eaters, causing a slowdown in the sales of sandwich rights and the cash they've been paying the shop in advance.<p>Now the sandwich shop owes sandwiches to all of its rights holders, each of which costs $1.50 in cash expenses (to pay suppliers, employees, etc).  However, instead of holding the cash it previously received for the sandwich futures, the shop has already spent it on marketing to other potential purchasers of sandwich futures.  Clearly, if the shop doesn't have the money to pay $1.50 x # outstanding rights or can't get financing, it will go out of business.  Because the shop was dependent on sales of sandwich rights to finance its growth, when the growth rate slowed, the money dried up.  In essence, the shop borrowed from the future by sucking in cash today for discounts on tomorrow's sandwiches.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what Groupon has done.  Its operating cash flow includes ""Accrued Merchant Payable"" of nearly $291M (3/31/11).  But its cash balance is about $208M (3/31/11).  Because it collects cash up front from individuals and pays merchants over time (or, in its non-US operations, only when coupons are redeemed), Groupon is showered with customer cash before it must pay merchants.  Roughly half of this cash eventually belongs to Groupon, while the other half is eventually owed to merchants (true, there is breakage, but if nobody redeems the coupon, that adds little value for the merchant, so significant breakage/non-redemption isn't necessarily in Groupon's long term interest).<p>In other words--and Groupon spells this out--if the growth rate in coupons sold to customers dives, Groupon could face a cash flow problem.  It's not a ponzi/pyramid scheme exactly, but it is a highly risky financial practice to spend cash you will owe tomorrow on expenses you incur today.  As long as the company grows and/or can sell shares to the public and increasing prices, it will do fine.  Once the growth slows or access to capital dries up, it's vulnerable.  Groupon may well outrun the cash demands it has piled up by going public.  But it can't maintain these growth rates forever--remember those other sandwich shops selling similar products?--and will ultimately face the music.<p>Don't believe me?  Here's a quote from their S1:\n""Our accrued merchant payable, which primarily consists of payment obligations to our merchants, has grown, both nominally and as a percentage of revenue, as our revenue has increased, particularly the revenue from our international segment....We use the operating cash flow provided by our merchant payment terms and revenue growth to fund our working capital needs. If we offer our merchants more favorable or accelerated payment terms or our revenue does not continue to grow in the future, our operating cash flow and results of operations could be adversely impacted and we may have to seek alternative financing to fund our working capital needs.""",1307059687

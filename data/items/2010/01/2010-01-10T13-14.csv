Then i moved from TP to QBasic because it was faster to run stuff directly from memory than via the compile->link->run route in my PC/XT :-P.<p>Btw there is a ready-to-use language in modern (Windows) systems too: VBScript. Just create a new file in Notepad, use the .vbs extension, save it, double click on it and you're set :-). About four years ago I wrote an article on a Greek magazine about introduction to programming and used VBScript for the concepts (i mostly wrote about the general idea of programming, but i needed something people could actually use and see in their computers). A few days ago someone told me that he got interested into programming by reading this article and after messing a bit with VBScript, he went to learn Pascal and C :-).",1263131306

He asked me to add him to the list, but I told him he'd have to be on Facebook for that to happen.  He replied, ""oh, so only customers of Facebook can join?""<p>I thought his use of the word ""customers"" was odd, because I was thinking that ""users"" would be more appropriate.<p>But then I got to thinking.  Yes, advertisers are clearly customers of Facebook: they pay money in return for a service.  But these advertisers wouldn't pay a dime were it not for Facebook's users, who represent to advertisers either existing or potential customers.  In that sense, users are very clearly customers, though not necessarily customers of Facebook.<p>However, time is money, and users of Facebook are spending a lot of it on Facebook (""spending time"" on Facebook: the connection between time and money is clear).  Furthermore, the time they spend on Facebook is crucial to Facebook's ability to attract and retain advertisers.<p>This makes them very much like customers, I think: they are purchasing a service from Facebook with something valuable (their time), and if they did not do so, the company would fail.",1263131149

It's scary how predictable that is.<p>Say n is your number of signups per day, your retention is 'industry average' (3 months or so for most consumer stuff, 12 months for b2b) and you charge 22.95, then for a consumer product you will make roughly (say 10 signups / day average across a month) 10 * 90 * 22.95 / month after 3 months of ramping up, for a b2b product you'll make 10 * 365 * 22.95 per month after 12 months of ramping up.<p>The retention is very important because it determines how far you can grow, a 1 month increase in retention in the above (b2c) scheme is 33% more turnover, but retention is the hardest of all the variables to get under control.<p>It is related to customer satisfaction, card expiry, product life cycle and so on, the signup rate is only affected by the quality of your marketing and your presentation.<p>edit:<p>When people launch a for-pay service and they see their first stats they usually think that the income is going to grow unbounded, but every product has a life-cycle and you really need to factor that in to get any realistic amounts.<p>This mistake is also present in the business plans of many start-ups, you have to assume some upper limit to the life cycle of a customer to get realistic figures.<p>It is usually a safe bet to plug the industry averages (3, respective 12 months for b2c or b2b) in, you may be a bit better but usually not much unless you have a very addictive/compelling product.<p>It is also good practice to over-deliver by a bit compared to your plans, if you have investors it keeps them happy.",1263130681

How should we punish non-violent white-collar criminals? Take away their holiday homes?<p>> It's the intellectually lazy, ""Common-sense"", Joe-Sixpack politics of 3-strikes laws that got us into this mess. ""Lock criminals up and throw away the key, I say!""<p>Most countries have laws that separate habitual criminals from society. Most people view prison as having four purposes:<p>1.	Rehabilitation (i.e. change the behaviour of a convicted individual through positive (reward) and negative (punishment) reinforcement).<p>2.	Punishment<p>3.	Protect the public by separating harmful individuals.<p>4.	Serve as a deterrent to potential criminals.<p>The “three strikes” and similar laws in other countries are clearly to protect the public by separating habitual criminals from society. This is completely reasonable.<p>The deterrent effect has two components – the severity of the punishment and the effectivety of the prosecution. If a criminal believes he can escape prosecution, the deterrent effect will not work.<p>Unfortunately the left did the most damage to the judicial system. Firstly, prison sentences aren’t a deterrent any more. In the old days you received a prison sentence with “hard labour” - this was removed because the left opposed it – in most countries prisoners sits around all day doing nothing (this also increases the cost of incarceration).<p>The same goes to work – it was usual practice to set prisoners to work in their community on government property/parks. This not only reduced the cost of their incarceration but served as a powerful deterrent to people who see them and shows them the disappointment that society views their actions.<p>In my country the left started “improving” the criminal and justice system (with almost all the suggestions leftist suggestions).

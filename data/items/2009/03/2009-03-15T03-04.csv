Blueprint, by default, uses a grid chunked into 40px segments, creating 940px wide design. You then place divs inline or nested to create your design.<p>Blueprint also provides some extra goodies like defining styles for forms, error and success styles for divs, and some ie fixes.",1237089541

We're not even discussing the same thing. The legal limit on alcohol is not to prevent people from dying, but to prevent them from driving when their reaction-time and situational awareness are reduced. Alcohol is easy to control because they can make you blow those alcohol-meters. How do you measure how ""high"" someone is? It's not so easy.<p>Scientific research on this topic does not seem mature enough. It's an ongoing effort. But it's better than nothing.<p>To cut a long story short: just because something as dangerous as alcohol is freely available and culturally acceptable, I think we should be careful about legalizing drugs. I have smoked pot, my friends have smoked pot. From my experience, it's a lot less dangerous than alcohol. Scientific seems to suggest that pot is not particularly dangerous (unless you smoke an entire field).<p>I don't think we disagree on much. The difference is that I believe that one should be exhaustive when analyzing this issue. All possibilities should be studied. Information should be provided in an unbiased manner. And, ultimately, people should be able to decide whether to consume or not without any baby-sitting from the government.",1237087865

If we find someone to be an idiot, we probably don't waste too much time with him.  So, we end up with a very biased view of the world.  Given this, when we see a smarmy-looking site for an expensive parrot book, we laugh and think, ""Who the hell would buy that?""  The guy who's running the site was able to see how dumb most Americans (or at least English readers) are and picked a business accordingly.<p>Also, many of us would be embarrassed to admit that we were making our money this way, so we avoid even considering such activities.<p>So, what other information niches exist that would satisfy the needs of some small fraction of other 90-some percent?

516534,comment,516155,516297,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"That's the rub. It doesn't occur to most Americans how many products contain corn syrup. Wander through any conventional supermarket in America. Study the ingredients list for whatever product you have in your hand. The list of ingredients is printed in a small, sans-serif font below or next to the nutrition chart.<p>Notice the corn syrup in condiments: ketchup, salad dressing, peanut butter, jam, some pickles and mustards, etc. Notice the corn syrup in yogurts, ice creams, and frozen desserts. Notice the corn syrup in fruit drinks and flavored milk drinks. Notice the corn syrup in breakfast cereals and brand-name hearty-looking breads. Notice the corn syrup in brand-name cookies and crackers (Ritz, Wheat Thins, IIRC). Notice the corn syrup in canned pie fillings. Notice the corn syrup spaghetti sauces. Notice the corn syrup in canned soups.<p>Any food <i>not</i> located at a far outside aisle is likely to contain corn syrup. If a food has a brand name and it comes in a bottle, jar, tub, or box, it probably contains corn syrup. If a food comes in a can and it's not plain vegetables, it probably contains corn syrup.<p>I kind of exaggerate here, but not much. I notice that factory producers have been eliminating corn syrup from some foods in the past year or two. So, you might see ""cane juice"" or sugar in the ingredients list, instead of corn syrup. Cane juice is the new euphemism for sugar.<p>One of my Russian-American friends said about ten years ago, ""I khate American food. Too sweet."" It's ""too sweet"" because so many products contain sweeteners. If you're accustomed to American food, you probably don't notice the sweetness. Therefore, it wouldn't occur to you that it contains corn syrup (or sugar).",1237087340

516529,comment,516276,516354,0,0,jerf,,,"Some of your repliers are beating around the bush a little, I'm going to come right out and say it: Source control systems are for <i>controlling source code</i>. They are built from top to bottom around the idea that they are storing text files. They are build around the idea that a text-based patch is a meaningful thing to use. They are build around the idea that there is a reasonable merge algorithm to use to merge two people's changes.<p>They can be used on things that physically resemble source code but aren't, like text-based document formats (raw HTML, for instance), but you probably won't need their full power and, by design, they lack features that would be useful in that case. For your convenience they are capable of storing small quantities of binary data since most projects have a little here and there. But in both cases, you're a bit out-of-spec.<p>When you try to stuff tons of binary data into them, they break. They do not just break at the practical level, in the sense that operations take a long time but maybe someday somebody could fix them with enough performance work. They break at the <i>conceptual</i> level. Their whole worldview is no longer valid. The invariants they are built on are gone. It's not just a little problem, it's fundamental, and here's the really important thing: It can't be fixed without making them no longer great source control systems.<p>I use git on a fairly big repository and the scanning is currently at the ""annoying"" level for me, but the scanning is there for good reasons, reasons related to its use as a source control system. On my small personal projects it definitely helps me a lot.<p>SVN is the wrong tool for the job. I don't know what the right tool is. It may not even exist. But SVN is still the wrong tool. (If nothing else you could hack together one of those key/value stores that have been on HN lately and cobble together something with the resulting hash values.)<p>And, going back to the original link, criticizing git for not working with a repository with large numbers of binary files is not a very interesting critique. If Perforce does work under those circumstances, I would conclude they've almost certainly had to make tradeoffs that make it a less powerful source control system. Based on what I've heard from Perforce users and critics, that is an accurate conclusion. But I have no direct experience myself.",1237086983

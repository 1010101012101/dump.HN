It's not gonna get you rubbing shoulders with VC's, for the most part, but folks in the valley show up for stuff. Unfortunately, most of the really good parties only get written up after they happen.",1207817807

I decided not to apply to Startup School and this makes me feel better.<p>The more interesting posts will be your post-Startup School ones [one, two, three months afterwards]. I really hope you are inspired and start a thread on your blog on how you are doing/doing it, post-startup school. Followup is everything.",1207815932

Were you ready before you decided or did you become ready once you decided?<p>As soon as my apt. lease is up, I'm seriously debating about: leaving my job, traveling to another country to maximize savings and learn Spanish, code, code, code, put it out there..<p>Even though I have a good job (and with this economy, as my Mom tells me), I have four or five ideas that I want to execute on. I'm starting to delude myself that I'd be happier slaving away in retail or the service industry (the economy) and coding at nights, working on projects that I am interested on. But I know that if I execute right, that finding a job won't be a problem (it will be a choice - job or startup)",1207815623

159743,comment,159648,159648,0,0,lyime,,,"I think there is a common misconception in the startup culture that if you cant convince a friend/buddy etc.. to become a co-founder/partner, your idea is not very good or you are not very good at pitching the idea.<p>I cant seem to find a co-founder, I am 22. I have many friends who are in tech, many in the bay area. Most of them are just not interested in doing startups right now. Some of them just want a stable job, they are getting paid well. Some of them are just not really into web2.0, someone of them don't have the passion/not driven.<p>So it is possible that your idea is great and it just so happens that you are unable to find a partner. I am in that boat and I think if there was a tool to find co-founders. There is definitely a good chance of having success in your idea, especially since there are many other people like me with the same dilemma.",1207815420

Here's my cunning plan.<p>I build things I find interesting, and search for product ideas that other people are willing to pay for.  I talk about what I do.  This seems like a good way to meet and talk to the sort of people who are interested in making money by doing the sort of thing I do.<p>There's been a lot of talk about how not having a CF is a handicap.  Let's say it is.  You can get started, or not, but not getting started doesn't seem to get you closer to your goal, make you a better CF, or bring you into contact with people who can help you with your business.<p>It would be nice to have a good CF; a long-time acquaintance with a compatible personality, complementary skill-set, rich parents, entrepreneurial bent, few obligations, etc., but you either know someone like that or you don't.  If you don't, it will take years to change that  (""long-term"") and it seems silly to wait, if you really want to do your own startup.<p>Sometimes, you have to make do with what you have.",1207815087

Just to get an application up and running on Amazon seems to involve delving into message boards (I have EC2/S3 accounts but it's learning how to port my web app is not a priority at the moment)<p>The premise of EC2/S3 is that you can ask for services/CPU on demand - however Google with AppEngine has significantly lowered the barrier to creating a scalable web app (by handling scaling for you, once you write to their APIs and give them your code [another issue]). Not everyone wants to be an Erlang expert and roll their own scalable code.. (some people just want to be able to build a cool popular app and outsource worries about scaling).",1207814543

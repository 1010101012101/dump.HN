But this is because nobody cares about what we do, so it might be even worse in the long term.",1206086192
142311,comment,142274,142274,0,0,bdfh42,,,"I am pretty sure that every trainee and junior programmer I have ever mentored has come to me with a ""bug in the compiler"". I always try and find the gentlest way possible to tell them that it's unlikely that there is a bug and if there was then in all probability their more experienced colleagues would know about it.<p>Usually however it is a good start point for revisiting the topic of program structure and the tricky question of ""state"". A quick re-write of the offending routine usually removes the ""bug"".",1206085888

142308,comment,141845,141845,0,0,krishna2,,,"One more thing to do would be to add a start_time via js on the top of the page. Then, another at the tail end of the page - then use a javascript function to calculate the difference. This will give you the time for the server (or your web app). [You can also do some code to your controller or view - however you have it to generalize for all pages].<p>Now, this time is not the same as the time that firefox takes to display the page. For this, you will have to use the start time on head and then use a js function that will be called on body onload. This can now take the difference and show you the browser rendering time alone.<p>I have often seen that some pages get generated in the server in under half a second, but takes more than a few seconds for firefox to render. [For example, table with lots of rows, with lots of divs and esp. if there is any dynamic modification of nodes].<p>Another technique I use is to also display the times for both server/browser, only when I am logged in - and also use color codes to show the severity of the situation. [Like Green for under half a second, red for over a second..etc].",1206085533

142306,comment,141898,141898,0,0,abstractwater,,,"I work for a large company and I also feel the way described in the article.  What baffles me the most is the constant need of approval in case I'm about to do something that goes a little beyond the ""company policies"", like setting up a public repository for code that's going to be released anyway.<p>Often these mysterious company policies are not explained in the first place, yet I'm supposed to adhere to them.  So I find myself pondering, ""Is it ok to do this?""  Engineering-wise (and by common sense) it would be a no-brainer.  Then I waste time and energy asking approval.  Sometimes I get denied and so I wasted my whole train of thoughts related to an otherwise obvious choice.  What bothers me the most is that the majority of people seem numb to these problems.<p>Why did you hire me if basically you're questioning my trust, and why are you blocking me from doing what I'm supposed to do?  Then why you invite me to ""fun"" events afterwards?",1206085015

And Napoleon was a tyrant trying to impose his will on an entire continent. If freedom is incompatible with Napoleonic dreams, that is not a bug.<p>Freedom fighters have often chosen the guerilla way.<p>A better example for your point would be the Americans in WWII. But even then, soldiers are not robots and the best commanders give their underlings the freedom to get the job done.",1206084048

The corporation's ""thoughts"" are comparatively slow and stupid. Maybe one day there will be some Borg-like way of making humans act together, which truly makes something smarter and more nimble than any individual. But I don't think you can argue corporations represent the next step in evolution.",1206083450

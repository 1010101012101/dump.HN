I'm convinced that you can get through a top law school while sitting on your thumb, dude.  There's nothing in there that a reasonably bright and literate high school student can't handle.  I'm not saying it's easy - a reasonably bright high school student is a pretty well educated person.  But it's not in the same leage as grad programs in hard science, math, or engineering.  I think the main reason for the 3-year grad degree is to keep smart people who could figure this out more quickly and offer services for less money out of the field.  To make it worse, lawyers lobby heavily for regulations that tend to increase their billable hours.  Restrict supply, increase demand, largely through government manipulation.  I just couldn't be a part of it.<p>Medicine is a bit less objectionable, but I do believe that the Nurse Practitioner field has shown that a very high quality of independent care provider in less time.  Nurse practitioners have to do quite a bit of grad school and apprenticing, so it's still a degree-intensive field. But physicians have definitely tried to use licensing to limit the competition they feel from NPs.<p>This is why I like, and admire, the software field.  It's totally open and free.  If my clients want to open up a book and try to learn it themselves, they are free to do so.  If they want to hire someone right out of high school, they are free to do so.  If they want only a PhD out of Stanford, that's fine too, as long as they're willing to pay.  It's a genuinely open and free market - and while that means there are a lot of truly crap programmers, it also means that a brilliant person who is ready to contribute doesn't have to deal with a cartel that wants to keep him or her out.",1199717142

I'm waiting for my XO to arrive (should be within a week or so), and I'm going to be handing it to my 4 year old daughter to see how she gets along with it.  She'd very much like a computer of her own and I'm hoping that she'll be able to figure out Draw and TamTam and Memorize.<p>Anyone else here got experience with XO and a small child?",1199715890

95603,comment,95382,95476,0,0,mdipierro,,,"True: compiling is obfuscation, not encryption but, the same argument applies to Java, VB, etc. Even compiled C++ can be disassembled. Anyway, web2py inlines some stuff before bytecode compiling so if you decompile a compiled web2py app you do not get a valid web2py app (because there is no one to one match between modules) unless you tweak it. In most of the cases it is not worth the task.",1199715016

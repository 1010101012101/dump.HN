First, find your iPhoto library, then copy it to an external drive. then, attempt the iPhoto upgrade. iPhoto libraries are self-contained, as are aperture libraries, so you can very easily duplicate folders. I suggest you run a library rebuild through iPhoto before copying it, and if you want to be extra sure, I also suggest moving it with a utility that can tell you if certain files have errors while copying. In the past, I have found Ditto to be pretty good for this.<p>I did this recently, as every few months I take a complete copy of my aperture library and migrate it to an external drive which I keep off-site at a friends house. He, in turn keeps his library at mine. The overall point is that iPhoto > photos is fairly trivial to test it out, and see how it works for you. (PS. this is even easier if you have enough space to just duplicate the drive in-place. If you do that, though, I still recommend library rebuild before duplicating.)",1451069601

By giving out slower internet. Or internet with a free data cap. Or a way of &quot;earning&quot; Internet data after watching some ads (see: Grameenphone in Bangladesh). I&#x27;d somewhat agree with the &quot;Some Internet is better than No internet&quot; argument, except that there are better ways of doing the &quot;some Internet&quot; which Facebook isn&#x27;t doing.<p>> why not facebook provide free internet access to poor.<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t even paying for the data in Free Basics. The telecom operators are (I assume their business plan is to get more people hooked onto the Internet so eventually more customers for them. A valid plan.). They can use the same business plan (in a net neutral way) for the slower internet or internet with a data cap options; and I believe that&#x27;s what Aircel is doing.<p>(Aside: When you look at it this way it becomes even more obvious how devious Facebook is here -- without putting in money of their own to finance the actual data, they, a third party, jumped in and convinced telecom operators to enact a scheme which <i>Facebook</i> has a lot of control over despite not being the primary financers of the scheme. They get lots of credit <i>and</i> lots of control, without actually doing anything. When framed this way the parallels with the Brits&#x27; takeover of India seem a lot more real.)<p>And really, the &quot;no access&quot; part of your argument isn&#x27;t really well founded either. For most, data plan costs aren&#x27;t the barrier to internet access (in fact, a smartphone capable of working with the modern internet[1] is more expensive than a few years&#x27; worth of basic data).<p>[1]: Fun fact: Facebook&#x27;s mobile app evolves pretty fast and becomes unusable on older phones either due to browser compatibility, OS compatibility, or speed issues.

10791934,comment,10788496,10791713,0,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"> <i>To put it technically, he was delta hedged but not vega hedged.</i><p>Delta, the first partial derivative on price of the Black-Scholes model of option pricing [1], is the rate at which the price of an option changes in relation to the price of the underlying asset. For example, a call option with delta=0.25 requires one own 1 unit of the underlying for every 4 options (keeping things simple) to be perfectly hedged, <i>i.e.</i> indifferent to changes in the price of the underlying. If you are running a leveraged operation, delta-hedged means well-hedged.<p>Unfortunately, as the price of the underlying changes delta changes. Yes, one can describe this relationship in terms of volatility (as the price changes, volatility will spike, which in turn feeds into the value of delta). But it is simpler to describe it in terms of the second partial derivative on price, gamma. Gamma is the rate at which delta changes in respect of price.<p>Non-derivative assets are delta=1 assets; for every dollar change in the price of AAPL the price of AAPL changes one dollar. Duh. Buying and selling delta=1 products helps one hedge delta. Gamma, being a second derivative, is non-linear. That means only non-linear products will aid you in your game against it. Options, and option-like products, are really the only ones with &quot;gammaness&quot;.<p>Big operations gamma hedge as much as they can while trying to keep their delta contained. For example, if you sell 100 puts, you would keep yourself delta-hedged while you try to profitably buy 100 puts. Provided the price doesn&#x27;t wiggle around too much, this works.<p>This strategy is problematic, however, if your counterparty is Mexico. Mexico wants LOTS of options. If you can&#x27;t give Mexico LOTS of options, Mexico can&#x27;t bother dealing with you. So you tend to want to provide Mexico with LOTS of options because LOTS of options commonly means LOTS of profits (and LOTS of fees).<p>But the market doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of people buying and selling LOTS of options. Just lots of options. So whereas one might usually be 20 or 50 or 70 percent gamma-hedged, when one just booked LOTS of options, 2% seems like a pretty good rate for the first week after the sale. Sucks to be you if Libya or Iran or the Sauds decide crash the party in that time.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black–Scholes_model</a>",1451069311

There&#x27;s a world of difference. ;)<p>Decent intro to ASIC design with FPGA comparison and a pricing chart to illustrate the high costs:<p><a href=""https://www.u-cursos.cl/ingenieria/2010/2/EL653/1/material_docente/bajar?id_material=305352"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.u-cursos.cl/ingenieria/2010/2/EL653/1/material_d...</a><p>Note that the tooling that makes this possible, esp design synthesis, can run to $1+ million per user per year. Some are merely upper 5-digits to lower 6-digits. Really inexpensive. Mask costs have come down for older nodes in recent years because fab equpiment is finally paid off. Yet, you&#x27;re still talking millions for a full SOC with modern features. And it will be slow as hell because it&#x27;s on old stuff if it&#x27;s a CPU.<p>That the market demands more speed, more functions, less power, etc is why they keep dropping to smaller node sizes. Each one adds new effects that try to break the chip. The electrons even tend to leak out of the transistors. Can&#x27;t even assume they&#x27;ll stay in them haha. Actually, from what I&#x27;ve read, it appears chips are broken all over on latest nodes with lots of logic there just to correct that. Here&#x27;s an example of the crap they have to do at 28nm, which <i>isn&#x27;t</i> cutting-edge anymore:<p><a href=""http://electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/understanding-28-nm-soc-design-arm-based-cores"" rel=""nofollow"">http://electronicdesign.com/digital-ics/understanding-28-nm-...</a><p>So, you need specialists that make big $$$, $1+ million in EDA tools, mask costs at millions a set <i>per trial</i>, and other stuff like boards (regularly 6 digits on kickstarter). That&#x27;s for an ASIC. An FPGA&#x27;s design flow ends at the RTL simulation part, has no mask costs, free to cheap EDA, and often has pre-made boards you can use. Price you pay is lower-than-ASIC performance, higher watts, and very-high per unit price. Still a better deal on lots of systems plus can be converted to a hybrid later (see eASIC Nextreme).<p>Hope that clears up why one would choose a FPGA over an ASIC. All that said, the difficulties they&#x27;re facing in this case is largely due to choice to stay on Intel, Xen, and other difficult-to-secure crap. If one forgoes those software, then one can use Cobham-Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC SOC&#x27;s since they&#x27;re designed for easy modification & already at quad-core. Academics made many secure CPU&#x27;s out of his stuff. Just gotta license it, modify it, and run it through later parts of ASIC flow. FPGA still cheaper, but you can FPGA it too. :)",1451069297

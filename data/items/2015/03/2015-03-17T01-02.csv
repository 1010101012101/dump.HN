A variety of changes in your environment, such as different coding standards, dependencies, programming languages, etc, will cause a severe impact to your performance.  The result is a strong negative reaction to things that should be objectively neutral.<p>That is, a change in your environment can make you feel incompetent, and it is easier to get angry at the change in the environment than it is to be honest with yourself about what is happening.<p>I forget which book I ran across this theory in, but it explains a variety of conflicts that repeatedly come up about formatting, libraries, programming languages, operating systems, and so on.  Furthermore it is easy to experience the feeling yourself when you go from an environment where you&#x27;re competent to a new one.

When the passion starts dying, I know its time to do something else.<p>I&#x27;ve been a nursery grower. I&#x27;ve been a produce grower. I&#x27;ve been a landscape contractor. I&#x27;ve been a laborer on a concrete crew. I&#x27;ve been a delivery driver (twice). I&#x27;ve been a surveyor. I&#x27;ve worked in road construction. I bet I&#x27;ve moved more large cactus than anyone in Arizona. I&#x27;ve moved the largest organ pipe cactus ever moved in Organ Pipe national park. I have been a cowboy on a large cattle ranch. (I wore tennis shoes to work and no one cared because I put out.. and then some). I worked processing samples in a research lab. I planted 10&#x27;s of thousands of acres of forage/ rangeland grass. I have been a telemarketer. I&#x27;ve been an equipment operator. I worked at a 5 star resort taking care of pools. I built three barns. I planted thousands of trees with large crews. I worked on a grape farm one summer. I lived in the grape cooler. I did all this stuff before I was 40. Some I did for a short time, some I did for years. But I did it all well. I thought about it, dreamed about, loved what I was doing even when it was hard, tried to find better ways to do it, and above all... I did it. My dream as a child was to work at a doughnut shop, and I plan to not die without realizing that dream. (Maybe when I&#x27;m retirement age). Work is love and if it isn&#x27;t for you... well that&#x27;s a sad state of affairs. There is no low work, all productive work is noble. People who think otherwise are puffed up and deluded and frankly foolish.<p>I started programming about 4.5 years ago. Now I work as a web developer. And... for where I work, I&#x27;m the best by a long ways and I haven&#x27;t even been there a year. I maintain some applications I have written for clients in my spare time and am currently working on a pretty large application tracking milk production for a dairy coop. I learned to speak Spanish. I taught myself Python. I taught myself HTML, CSS, JS and SQL. I know Linux. I know world history. I have an unused college degree. I took several graduate level statistics classes. I can tie many kinds of kinds of knots and braid a whip. I&#x27;m an expert tree pruner and a pretty good cook too. And not a half bad fisherman. And this is only a small part of what I can do and have done.<p>Do what you love, don&#x27;t give a crap, find what is important and focus on it and resist nonsense at all costs. Tell them (nicely) to fuck off if they interrupt your production or are keeping you from doing/getting what you need to get by (food, sleep etc.). Usually, if you are worth it, they will slink away and let you continue your business. Leave when the excitement dies or its time to do something else. But most of all... always be passionate, always push yourself a little, push others around you a little, always live your work. That&#x27;s my philosophy and I don&#x27;t see it being any other way.<p>This guy has a crappy loser attitude. Remember... somewhere, someone is passionate or was at one time. That&#x27;s how the pyramids got built. Be passionate or suffer hauling blocks on the end of a rope. That&#x27;s the choice. Sorry for the long rant.. but people like the author drive me nuts.",1426557205

9215811,comment,9212860,9215040,0,0,pornel,,,"Aligned subdivisions are not that much of a problem actually.<p>I&#x27;ve tested median cut that can cut at various angles and variants that cut out spheres, and it didn&#x27;t make much difference.<p>Choice of the box to cut and the location where you cut is more important. Wu&#x27;s method is nice in this case because it exactly measures variance of sets after a split, while median cut just estimates.<p>However, Wu&#x27;s method needs lookup tables for the whole color (hyper)cube, which requires either large (or for RGBA still ridiculous) amount of RAM or reduced precision, and losing bits of input is way worse than having suboptimal division.<p>The biggest wins I&#x27;ve found (and implemented in libimagequant) were:<p>• Voronoi iteration after generating palette (like a final step in LBG quantization). This shifts axis-aligned subdivisions to local optimum (I&#x27;ve tried applying that after every subdivision, but it didn&#x27;t matter — once in postprocessing is enough!)<p>• Adjust weights/counts in histogram from quality feedback measured from remapped image. If you&#x27;re aiming to minimize MSE, then that&#x27;s not too expensive and it&#x27;s similar to gradient descent.",1426557124

However, those who put the time into making a proper pourover know better.<p>The best cup of coffee, for most of us, is <i>supposed</i> to have a certain amount of those bitter elements that the AeroPress is too cool to extract. Optimal extraction occurs between 92 and 96 degrees C. 74-80C is just too cool for optimal extraction. I&#x27;ve tested the SCAA findings in countless experiments. Their research, based on double-blind taste tests, is well done, and in my experience, quite accurate.<p>The information on the AeroPress FAQ, which talks about the grounds on the bottom of the bed brewed using traditional methods being much cooler, is just plain wrong.

It&#x27;s often even worse because rent control encourages so many off-the-books subleases, so they can&#x27;t directly deal with the landlord for fear of being caught. If the lease holder decides to give the lease up, they&#x27;re screwed. This has happened to more than one of my friends who lived with someone else who had the lease and then moved out. The original leaseholder kept the lease as a courtesy, but it&#x27;s actually a liability to them and they won&#x27;t do it indefinitely. It&#x27;s a shitty situation for all involved.<p>One argument against rent control is that it drastically drives up the price of the available units because there&#x27;s such a reduced supply, exactly because the &quot;trapped&quot; can&#x27;t move. This is a vicious cycle that causes even more renters to become trapped.<p>With subsidies instead of rent control, the available rental stock would be bigger, renters could choose from more options, and not be penalized for needing to move. Subsidies would still have an effect of increasing demand and ability to pay, thus pushing up prices a little, but the price inflation would be spread across the whole market, rather than concentrated on just the small portion of vacant units.",1426556604

It&#x27;s painful to make one html file per renderable item -- and debugging takes more time (once you&#x27;ve found who&#x27;s responsible for rendering it, you need to check the corresponding template, so there&#x27;s an additional step in your way.) There&#x27;s no semantic in using the filesystem to organize your templates: it&#x27;s the code that specify the meaning, and your programming language provides more organization units than your FS (or should we do &quot;one function per file and one directory per class/module&quot;?).
(Also, the obvious filename typo vs static checking of function names; and the fact that your template is going to contain some rudimentary form of code or force you to obfuscate your intent even more.)<p>Which is why I don&#x27;t like the proposal: it&#x27;s not unifying HTML and Erlang, it&#x27;s compiling string macros into Erlang.

Nobody (sane) is optimizing for &quot;amount of cars on the road&quot;, but rather the benefits that cars bring (economic benefits due to streamlined transportation, etc). Generally when the term &quot;waste&quot; is used, the implication is:<p>If option A can provide the benefits that option B can provide with less cost (in this case, space), then the incremental space being used is &quot;wasted&quot;.

9215643,comment,9214500,9214500,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"Some great passages in there.  This one could have been written today:<p><pre><code>   One of the peculiar phenomena of our time is the 
   renegade Liberal. Over and above the familiar Marxist 
   claim that &#x27;bourgeois liberty&#x27; is an illusion, there is 
   now a widespread tendency to argue that one can only 
   defend democracy by totalitarian methods. If one loves 
   democracy, the argument runs, one must crush its enemies 
   by no matter what means. And who are its enemies? It 
   always appears that they are not only those who attack 
   it openly and consciously, but those who &#x27;objectively&#x27; 
   endanger it by spreading mistaken doctrines. In other 
   words, defending democracy involves destroying all 
   independence of thought. This argument was used, for 
   instance, to justify the Russian purges. The most ardent 
   Russophile hardly believed that all of the victims were 
   guilty of all the things they were accused of. but by 
   holding heretical opinions they &#x27;objectively&#x27; harmed the 
   régime, and therefore it was quite right not only to 
   massacre them but to discredit them by false 
   accusations. The same argument was used to justify the 
   quite conscious lying that went on in the leftwing press 
   about the Trotskyists and other Republican minorities in 
   the Spanish civil war. And it was used again as a reason 
   for yelping against habeas corpus when Mosley was 
   released in 1943.


   These people don&#x27;t see that if you encourage 
   totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will 
   be used against you instead of for you...</code></pre>",1426554308

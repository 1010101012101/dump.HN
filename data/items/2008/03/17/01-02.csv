And who knows what kind of shady dealings at Bear might come to light during the acquisition?  Dimon & Co. had only a weekend to put this deal together -- not nearly enough time to fully inspect Bear's books and to figure out all the risks of the trade.  They had to set a price low enough to protect themselves.",1205718581

138590,comment,138515,138515,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I don't know of any ""how to be a VC"" books, but here's what I understand about VCs:<p>1. It's easy to be a casual angel investor (typically investing your own money) but not so easy to be a VC (risking others' money). VCs typically create funds in the hundreds of millions from a number of large organizations (pension funds, endowments, etc). A couple millionaires who simply have a lot of money but no VC experience aren't going to have much credibility when raising hundred of million dollar funds.<p>VCs are fiduciaries to their limited partners, so they're responsible for explaining all their investments. Angels can invest in a company that makes toothpaste out of poo if they want.<p>2. For the same reason, VCs also usually sit on the board of the companies they invest in. Angels typically don't.<p>3. Different VC firms have different policies on selecting which companies to fund. Some might require unanimity, some majority, some 2/3s, etc.<p>4. VCs typically make money two ways: yearly management fees regardless of how well the fund does, and a certain percentage of the profits of the fund.<p>5. VCs are professional investors who invest other people's money. They may also invest some of their own money, but the majority comes from outside investors. See #4.",1205718179

Bear Stearns does own it's building, which means JP Morgan is getting a huge piece of midtown real-estate as part of the deal.

One letter is more than enough.\n- It already has enough color, don't color any of the letters or the dot over the i.<p>You should always consider whether or not your logo will look good if you have only one color to work with.  Think about things like screening your logo in black-and-white (e.g., a t-shirt or trade-show duffel bag).  Incidentally, this is one reason to avoid gradients in general (another being that they just look like crap).  This is also why the bevel has to go.   So will the sound-meter analogy carry through with just black?  I think it might lose something if you don't have green and red to work with, but that's just my opinion.<p>You should also make sure that you can shrink your logo down to a teeny-tiny size and have it still be recognizable.  Think about things like favicons.<p>The font in the logo is actually pretty good... it's clean, readable, and a bit edgy.<p>I'm certainly no graphic designer, this is just stuff that I've read about logo design over the years.  :)",1205717188

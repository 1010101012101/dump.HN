4798320,comment,4798049,4798241,10,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"Ok brace yourself, this is gonna be a long answer :) Go down for the TLDR if you don't want to read everything.<p>It really depends on your approach. This project isn't well suited for performance, because it treats OCaml's <i>bytecode</i>, which is very hard to optimize for performance, because it has been designed to be interpreted by an Abstract Machine, not compiled.<p>For example, it is stack based, arguments are passed on the stack explicitly when a function call happens. On the other hand LLVM is register based, with function arguments. You then have two choices :<p>- Either you translate the bytecode very directly, by using an explicit stack (eg. an array of memory). This is the easiest approach, but it produces code that is hard/impossible to properly optimize.\n- Either you try to make a model translation, from stack based to register based, and translate every semantic to the LLVM model (for example, pass function arguments as LLVM function arguments instead of putting them in a stack manually). This approach is <i>much</i> more difficult, but promises a lot more potential for optimization.<p>Another problem is that OCaml's bytecode is untyped. You loose all type information.<p>We tried both approaches in the Z3 project. The main branch is based on the direct-translation/explicit-stack approach. It is not very fast, and hasn't a lot of promises for going faster.<p>There are experimental branches based on the translation model. We were able to get much better performance with them on some code. There is a lot of potential for optimization, because, this way, you write LLVM idiomatic code, and you are able to reconstruct some type information, that enables you to do further optimizations. But there are drawbacks :<p>- It is much more complicated. The ZAM isn't formally specified so you pretty much have to read the code of the VM to understand what's going on. Debugging is horrible.<p>- Once you're there you have to provide your own Garbage Collector. In the direct-translation approach, we were able to use OCaml's garbage collector directly, because we re-used the interpreter stack. But in this approach, you have at least to provide a way to scan the roots. And once you write LLVM idiomatic bytecode, you realize how ill suited it is for relocating garbage collection.<p>TLDR : In the end it is just not worth it to optimize this project for performance. A better approach would be to start from scratch and do a real OCaml -> LLVM compiler for ocamlopt, that would be able to use the full AST with type information.<p>But even if you did that you'd still have to tackle the Garbage Collection issue, that is not an easy one :)<p>EDIT : To provide more context, this is a very good post by Xavier Leroy on the do-ability of an OCaml->LLVM compiler, and on its interrest (keep in mind Leroy is conservative about that, but it's probably a good thing).<p><a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2009/03/3a77bfcca0f90b763d127d1581d6a2f1.en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/ml-archives/caml-list/2009/03/3a77b...</a>",1353167869

With the amount of work they'd already done, they had a product they were ready to start selling and could have set up an on-line store from day one.  The low target ($5000) basically guaranteed they could run off 500 or 1000 units <i>and</i> move them out the door immediately.<p>Since most of us could throw that amount on our credit cards with ease, the only rational reason to run the kick-starter campaign was to make sure the product was wanted before committing to production.<p>I'm not saying this is all bad ... in fact it's way better than the campaigns with cool ideas but backed by founders with no idea how to deliver.

That Google doesn't ""like"" what I do has no moral or legal weight. The same goes for sites that accept user-generated content.<p>Obviously not everybody who's a spammer is good at it or a true hacker, but I would venture a guess that most hackers are blackhat if they do SEO, simply because they see this as a system that can be exploited with controlled heuristic testing as apposed to some superfluous tools and a whack community a la seoMoz.org<p>And it's not a zero-sum game. Google is forced to improve their natural language processing capabilities, their ability to execute more computationally expensive processing on massive amounts of content, so on and so forth, to try and keep up and provide a legitimate product.<p>So back to the spamming; Any site that allows you to put a link on it is a target for seo, of course. Maximizing c-class IP diversity among links is important. But more importantly, these pages are usually Tier-1 to Tier-2 in link schemes as it's effective to point the low level forum spam at user-content generated sites with strong domain authority and funnel the juice to your primary site. They're basically just buffers.<p>How long does it last? Varies greatly on how you're promoting it, the niche its in, etc. It doesn't always have to be ""pump and dump"" - I have multiple blogs over a year old that are alive and producing $1,200-$2,000 month each with almost no effort. When you can create just one of those blogs with about 10 hours worth of work (in total), there's obviously money to be made.

It's highly unlikely a judge is going to find you have the same rights as the open source license, unless you were actually relying on <i>all</i> of those rights.  You certainly would not be able to sublicense those rights further, except to those you had already.  This is not the same as Novus's ability to ""stop licensing the software to new parties"", it means you would not be able to give others the rights you had gotten through estoppel.<p>In effect, estoppel mainly going to protect you from damages, not give you the right to use it as open source.<p>2. It certainly depends, but the apparent authority question is a lot closer than you make it out to be.  There are plenty of cases in the US where ""the nature of the transaction"" should have caused one to question whether the employee had authority, etc. \nNot just that, but in New York state, where Novus Partners is, the law is nowhere near like you make it out to be.\nAFAIK, under New York State law, the apparent authority doctrine will hold a principal responsible for its agents actions as long as the <i>principal</i> clothed the agent with apparent authority. Novus Partners would have had to have done something <i>explicit</i> to make you believe this person had authority to open source.<p>See Hallock v. State, 64 N.Y.2d 224, 231 (1984).<p><pre><code>  Essential to the creation of apparent authority are words\n  or conduct of the principal, communicated to a third party,   \n  that give rise to the appearance and belief \n  that the agent possesses authority to enter into a  \n  transaction,\n\n  An agent can never by his own acts imbue himself with\n  apparent authority, Id.\n\n  [T]he existence of apparent authority depends upon a   \n  factual showing that the third party relied upon the\n  misrepresentation of the agent because of\n  some misleading conduct on the part of the principal  not \n  the agent, Id.\n\n  Moreover, a third party with whom the agent deals may rely \n  on an appearance of authority only to the extent that such   \n  reliance is reasonable, Id.\n</code></pre>\nThe only communication I see from Novus Partners here is something saying ""sorry, he had no authority"". If there is something else, great, you may be right.

Yes, I was &*!@-ing my pants yesterday when it hit ~$505.)<p>The difference with Apple and other momentum stocks is that Apple isn't like Netflix, where hype deeply overshadowed the problem they have with increasing content costs, or Groupon, which simply has a terrible business model.<p>Apple makes an incredible amount of real money and real demand.  In this 4th quarter, Apple will make more money than Cisco will throughout its entire year.<p>My concern isn't that people will all of a sudden stop buying Apple hardware... that simply won't happen.  They will continue to make billions upon billions of dollars.<p>My concern is that there are a number of strategic missteps almost as soon as Steve Jobs died.  I think the iPad mini will cannibalize iPad sales completely and I think a lot of strategic decisions appears to be fraught with confusion and desperation, like Apple Maps, releasing iPad 4 6 months after iPad 3, etc.  I get the argument as to why they made the iPad Mini (my wife wants to get one because it will fit in her purse easier), but I still think very few will buy iPads, and they will need to double iPad Mini sales to make up for lost iPad sales, but I guess we'll see in January.<p>The major difference with Apple and a company like Microsoft or Cisco is that they don't have much recurring revenue streams.  Most of their revenues come from consumers purchasing their goods quarter after quarter.  In order to keep growing revenues, they really have to maintain their amazing pace of innovation.<p>If they make a really bad strategic misstep, and people slow down in terms of buying the products, it will show up immediately, and they won't have a strong enterprise pipeline to buffer them.  In 2011, Apple sales were about $60B.  In fiscal 2012, they were over $100B.  So, could their revenues drop to $60B in a year?  It's not probable, but it's possible.<p>That being said, their PE ratio is ridiculously low, something like 10x next year's earnings, and they have $120B in cash.  They can do something ridiculous like buy Facebook or even Cisco for cash, and still have more money than most other companies out there, so there is a lot of room for dramatic and aggressive action by Apple.",1353166068

Some people are saying that Apple is releasing only small iterations on existing products rather than blockbuster new products, but for every brand new product Apple has released since 1998 or so they've released far more iterative improvements. Some people are pointing to new services that are flawed, but Apple has released flawed services in the past (MobileMe?) and that hasn't had much of an impact on customer demand.<p>Does Apple face stronger competition from Samsung and others? Yes, but any reasonable investor should have factored in the fact that Apple's competitors would do a decent job building comparable products.<p>It seems to me that Apple's potential for growth remains unchanged - even if you don't factor in some new blockbuster product, in PCs they are growing at the expense of other manufacturers and they still have a lot of room for growth internationally. I don't see anything that's justified a 25% drop in value.",1353164712

Traditional captchas are fairly ineffective, but written questions like ""what color rhymes with true?"" seem to work pretty well for smaller sites.<p>Bigger sites dealing with a larger volume of traffic almost always require regular human intervention, curated IP block lists, stealth banning and the like.",1353164547

There are going to be fairly explicit standards about what should be endorsed and what shouldn&#x27;t.  Roughly things shouldn&#x27;t be endorsed if they are gratuitously uncivil or content-free, but there will presumably be a fully detailed version of that policy.  And there will probably also be a version of showdead for pending comments.  (Already anyone who can endorse can see them at /pending.)<p>We&#x27;re hoping that this feature will make the site <i>more</i> hospitable to women.  That wasn&#x27;t the only reason for doing it, because users get stupid and/or nasty about lots of topics (or any topic, if they happen to start insulting one another), but certainly some of the most cringe-worthy threads we&#x27;ve cringed over have involved female programmers.  So it would be hard to imagine a version of &quot;working&quot; for which pending comments working would not thereby make HN more welcoming to women.",1395968392
7484614,comment,7484304,7484526,3,0,vwinsyee,,,"I agree with your general sentiment. However, it only takes one member of the underrepresented group (with endorsing capability), or any member of a centrist or neutral party, to approve the a comment. (And as of so far, it doesn&#x27;t seem like pending comments can be disapproved, e.g. by a hostile party.)<p>Granted, it&#x27;s true that by nature of being underrepresented, the probability of that one member showing up to approve the comment <i>may</i> be unacceptably low. But I doubt it. In other words, to use your example, as long as the probability is high enough that at least one woman will show up to approve another woman&#x27;s comment, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>Personally, I think that this probability is pretty high, though, as pg mentions, this&#x27;ll have to be determined empirically. For example, it&#x27;s entirely possible (as discussed in previous threads), that the population of <i>active</i> endorsers are skewed toward certain groups. Or that even a slightly <100% probability of legit comments being seen can ultimately compound systemic biases in the long run.",1395968392

While they may have mulled over this game for a year, it remains a <i>relatively</i> simple idea and execution (compared to most other mobile apps). Threes has always seemed a little odd to me given that it was endlessly pitched on HN by people who seemed to believe that the authors are owed some debt of gratitude (even before the clones appeared), while endless rich and innovative apps languish on the market. I&#x27;m not saying they don&#x27;t, but the way they were singled out seemed incredibly strange.<p>There is something in this story about the value of ideas. For years we&#x27;ve heard that ideas are worthless, and execution is everything. In this case the execution was very easily cloned, and such is the case with most games and apps now, and the real novelty was the idea. So where does that leave that equation? Is the idea still worthless because the execution was cloned? Does the idea now have value? Etc.",1395968381

So that it becomes a natural behavior, in keeping with existing norms on this site. (perhaps emphasize the upvote button with color-coding, to indicate that the upvote also endorses the comment)<p>If not, why not? Why shouldn&#x27;t an endorsement count as an upvote that provides karma?<p>Second Question:<p>Do pending comments also apply to users with endorsement powers, or are their comments always visible by default, due to their endorsement privileges? I&#x27;m assuming not.<p>What if a privileged user were also required to be endorsed by a fellow karma-enabled user who was not the author of the comment under review, as a form of peer review? In other words, just because you have enough karma to review someone else&#x27;s comments, still does not guarantee that your own judgement of your personal statements might hold universal, objective merit.",1395968314
7484610,comment,7484106,7484106,20,0,ghshephard,,,"I loved threes,  Played it for close to 20-30 hours during winter break.  As soon as 2048 came out, I managed to get to 2048 on my second try based on my experience with threes.   I play 2048 in my browser whenever I have a spare 5 minutes, and when I&#x27;m on the Bus, I still frequently hop into a quick game of Threes.<p>The mechanics of the two games are very similar, and obviously 2048 is a direct descendent of threes - but I wouldn&#x27;t go so far to say that one is better than the other.<p>Threes has claim to originality, and first publication, so significant credit does need to go to Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend and composer  Jimmy Hinson of Sirvo for their original invention.<p>But, Threes does have some &quot;issue&quot; - one is really poor startup times.  It&#x27;s slow enough that I am more likely to play 2048 in my browser, than bother firing up Threes on my iPhone.   The piece assignment in threes, is also somewhat less pleasing to my experience than in 2048, for whatever reason.<p>Also - sometimes you are looking for nice quick fun - I get a nice rush of (finger mashing) 2048 to the 512 stage, and then very, very quickly racing to 2048 instinctively (plus the crush of defeat if I make a flickering mistake and get my pieces out of place).<p>Threes requires a lot more attention - I can&#x27;t really play it at full-key-flick-speed - Not every game has to be chess.<p>If you read through the emails, and design history on the &quot;making of&quot; - it really, really emphasizes how damn hard it is to build that original kernel of genius.  And then the piling on of all the clones/knockoffs/descendants shows how trivial it is for others to stand on the shoulders of genius.<p>One challenge of the AppStore (and obviously the Android stores, and simply by definition the Web) - is that there is no real way to &quot;reward&quot; the original developers for their many months of hard work, when others can simply clone, tweak the artwork and mechanics (or in the case of Zynga, just the artwork) - and release and market their own duplicate of a game after someone else has done all the hard work.<p>But, sometimes this opportunity to reinvent is good - I&#x27;ve tried a <i>lot</i> of podcast apps - because I listen to podcasts for about 4-6 hours/day, and, while &quot;Cast&quot; is my current preferred App, I&#x27;m looking forward to what Marco does with Overcast.    I would have hated it if we couldn&#x27;t have lots of diversity in that marketplace.  (And I would have shot myself if I had to use Apple&#x27;s (original, horrible) &quot;reel-reel&quot; podcast player).<p>Another approach though are apps like  Vesper - It&#x27;s &quot;another&quot; notepad app - but the developers (Q Branch&#x27;s John Gruber, Brent Simmons, and Dave Wiskus),  took months and months to polish and refine till it creates a totally different notepad experience (and, in my opinion, the best one on the iPhone) - isn&#x27;t it good that they had the opportunity to build something in the notepad category, in a different way?<p>All in all though, I hope that Sirvo&#x27;s Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend and Jimmy Hinson get the credit they deserve for building the &quot;first of&quot;.",1395968308

7484608,comment,7483509,7484444,2,0,dalke,,,"Sparse areas don&#x27;t have a shortage of parking, do they? That is, the context for this side branch is for when street parking is constantly full. A fix in that case is to charge for parking, and improve mass transit.<p>The idea around reducing zoning requirements for parking is to allow a core to emerge. And everyone&#x27;s agreed that it will take a long time. But it has to start somewhere, and it&#x27;s more difficult if zoning requires (say) 1.5 parking spaces per 1-bdr apartment, even when in an area well served by mass transit.<p>You mentioned Santa Monica. Here&#x27;s their planning commission report on parking for the city - <a href=""http://www.smgov.net/departments/pcd/agendas/Planning-Commission/2013/20130130/s2013013006Aa.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smgov.net/departments/pcd/agendas/Planning-Commis...</a> .<p>It includes: Reduce residential off-street parking requirements for some housing types in the Transit-Oriented and Mixed Use area to reflect actual Census data for household vehicle ownership and eliminate the visitor space requirement in all areas. Reduce off-street parking requirements for certain types of commercial uses (general office, hotels, restaurants, markets) in the Transit-Oriented and Mixed Use areas.<p>It also points out that while there is a &quot;Perception of parking scarcity&quot;, that scarcity doesn&#x27;t really exist.  Indeed, &quot;Santa Monica, like many other cities state and nationwide, has a parking supply that exceeds parking demand.&quot; Instead, &quot;drivers will almost always choose an on-street space over an off-street space and indicates that the <i>management</i> of parking resources, not the supply, is the underlying issue.&quot;",1395968253

And I feel for these guys having to watch everybody and his brother pile on to the idea they had to work so hard to tease out into reality.<p>But here is some hard truth: none of that matters.<p>Nobody cares how hard you had to work to get from idea to product. All they care about is <i>what you have produced</i> at the end of all that work. What makes it better or worse is how it stacks up relative to the competition -- even the competition that is shamelessly riffing off your core ideas -- not how much sweat you put into it.<p>And I gotta say, having played 2048, 1024 and Threes (the Android versions, at least), I think of the three of them 1024 stands up the best. It takes the core ideas in Threes and sands them down into a game that is easier to grasp and plays faster, without becoming so simple (a la 2048) that it becomes a game a script can beat. Threes makes you swipe-swipe-swipe after every game to get your score and &quot;sign&quot; it (why do I care about signing it?) before you can play again; 1024 just moves you straight on to the next game. Mobile games need to be simple and streamlined, and 1024 understands that imperative better than Threes does.<p>I say all this to help others understand why I would point to this essay as an example of how <i>not</i> to respond to a problem like a barrage of cloners. It&#x27;s because this essay sees the world entirely from the developers&#x27; perspective -- look how hard we worked! Look how long we labored! Look how subtle our decisions were! -- which is exactly the wrong angle.<p>You want your communications to speak from the <i>customer&#x27;s</i> perspective, not from your own. Customers don&#x27;t give you brownie points for how hard you worked on something. All they care about is how to get the best product for the best price. So if you put your heart and soul into something, and then someone comes along, tweaks your thing and makes it better, the way to respond isn&#x27;t to ask people to respect how hard you worked; it&#x27;s to look closely at the new thing, <i>understand why people like it better</i>, and then bring that understanding to your next iteration or your next product.",1395966931

Like the CCV classifier linked, Caffe is fully open-source [2], has a downloadable state-of-the-art model pre-trained on ImageNet [3], and scripts/documentation that make it very easy to compute features using our pre-trained model or other models [4].<p>Unlike the linked CCV release (unless I&#x27;m misinformed -- haven&#x27;t actually tried it, please correct me if I say anything inaccurate), Caffe supports completely customizable architectures via a configuration language, fully supports training [5], finetuning [6], and inference (feature extraction/classification) in these customizable architectures, and seamlessly runs on both CPU and GPU.<p>Caffe is also very fast; twice as fast at CPU feature computation as its predecessor DeCAF, and faster than cuda-convnet at training/testing ImageNet architectures on a Titan/K40 GPU.<p>The linked CCV release does mention Caffe, but quickly dismisses it due to the license.  It&#x27;s true that our pre-trained model [3] is licensed only for non-commercial use,  but ALL of the Caffe code is BSD-licensed, including the exact script we used to train said model.  So if you&#x27;re a commercial entity, using Caffe for feature extraction/classification from a state-of-the-art network is a matter of purchasing a $1000 GPU (NVIDIA Titan -- I&#x27;m assuming you own a computer), downloading the ImageNet dataset, and waiting about a week for training to converge.  This will buy you the ability to adapt the classifier to YOUR visual classification problem by finetuning [6], rather than being stuck with the particular 1000 categories the pre-trained model knows about.<p>[1] <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/BVLC/caffe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BVLC/caffe</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/getting_pretrained_models.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/getting_pretrained_models.ht...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/imagenet_pretrained.ipynb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/ex...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/imagenet_training.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/imagenet_training.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/caffe-presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/caffe-presentation.pdf</a>  (see page 14)",1395966572

Getting to your job on Wilshire is going to take more than 11 minutes, maybe 30. The time you may have saved in taking the train, will be out weighed by the walk to work. Not to mention that most of the people working there are not living along the expo line, many live in the valley. Getting a line from the Valley to West LA is all but impossible. There isn&#x27;t a lot of land to put it on. You have maybe Sunset to squeak it though, and that&#x27;s not all that flat of land either.<p>You have to get to work, and you want to do it quickly.

Included in this was a five-year commitment from Microsoft to release Microsoft Office for Macintosh as well as a US$150 million investment in Apple.&quot; - People forget back then that if MSFT dropped Office support for Apple it would have been a significant blow.<p>- Then Steve Jobs himself. I think these specifics support my initial comment.<p>&quot;If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again, we have to let go of a few things here. We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win, Microsoft has to lose. We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that&#x27;s great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don&#x27;t do a good job, it&#x27;s not somebody else&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s our fault. So I think that is a very important perspective. If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac, we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude; we like their software.\nSo, the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I&#x27;m concerned. This is about getting Apple healthy, this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again.&quot;",1395965148

7484352,comment,7483509,7483720,1,0,_delirium,,,"> multiple non-residence ownership taxation<p>One thing Copenhagen has done (in a not entirely coordinated way, with some messy parts) is to have large amounts of the housing stock just not permit non-resident ownership at all. A very common organizational structure is the resident-owned cooperative apartment building, and the bylaws usually require that you live there as your main residence as a condition of ownership: if you move, you sell. (Some exceptions for limited-time absences, e.g. if you take a sabbatical abroad, you can rent it in your absence without selling, usually for up to two years.) Another common organizational structure is buildings owned by nonprofit associations dedicated to building and maintaining good-quality housing. They rent but don&#x27;t sell apartments; they do allow subletting but again with time limits. This particular class of buildings arose initially as &quot;improve the housing of workers&quot; type charitable initiatives (some funded by philanthropists, and some by labor unions), but the organizations have persisted to the modern era, and have continued to construct new buildings (partly through state support for construction costs).<p>The market is being liberalized a bit lately, with many new buildings being sold as private condominium ownership. But there are some worries that if non-resident ownership is completely liberalized, the city will become like Paris, with a large proportion of apartments in the city center being <i>pieds-à-terre</i> owned by people who live elsewhere, which sit empty most of the year except when the owner wants to fly in to eat at Noma or something.",1395964868

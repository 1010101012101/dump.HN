Frequencies used for mobile communication are limited and with that the total bandwidth of a cell site is limited.<p>This is the main reason new G&#x27;s are coming out, 3G is packing many more bits per Hz then 2G was, and 4G is doing yet more.<p>New frequency bands are released for mobile communications to further alleviate the problem.<p>Network planners have to install more and more cells in dense urban areas and be careful not creating too much noise on the frequency as they have to reuse frequencies and codes.<p>In a place like HK skyscrapers are creating lots of problems with signal shadows and reflections.<p>Major office buildings sometimes have (unintentionally) selective glass that keeps outside mobile comms frequencies out and have indoor antennas that have strong and clean signals, but this is hardly the case for residential buildings.",1371452179
5891823,comment,5883504,5884816,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I don&#x27;t see anything inherently broken about null-terminated strings. It means that the smallest string that can be represented is a single byte, and the largest string that can be represented is unlimited. By mixing in an integer, you&#x27;re expanding the smallest string and placing an arbitrary limit on the largest string. If the integer and string data are mixed in a struct, then strings pack much less tightly, not just because of the space taken up by the integer, but also because it needs to be aligned. Most of the things you&#x27;d want to do with a string are O(n) anyway, like print to the terminal. Null-terminated strings aren&#x27;t perfect for every use, but no representation is, and C doesn&#x27;t prevent you from using a different representation when it&#x27;s more appropriate. If you&#x27;re writing a parser, then that&#x27;s a more demanding application than usual, and you ought not feel locked into using the default representation.",1371452072

I took the class when it was offered at Stanford and one of the most valuable things I took out of the class was how to build APIs for different business functions. Being able to automate huge parts of your business, regardless of what industry you&#x27;re in, is a huge advantage. Think about an energy company building APIs to monitor consumption and efficiency at client sites and adjusting their work accordingly -- that&#x27;s huge. This class does a lot more than teach you how to build webapps; it teaches you to think in an automation mindset and happens to teach you a lot of useful skills along the way.",1371452054

5891711,comment,5890752,5890752,1,0,goodcanadian,,,"I have done this . . . sort of. The job ad did not explicitly require a PhD, but it was the sort of position where one would be expected (notionally, a postdoc). If the position is meant to be research, you are almost certainly going to need a PhD and a record of publication. Seriously, a PhD by itself isn&#x27;t even worth much any more. However, there are plenty of job ads that ask for a PhD which are not research and do not really require a PhD. What I did was to contact the decision maker (sometimes it is easy to find out who that is, sometimes not), and then talk to him. You can ask if he is willing to consider someone without a PhD, and then give brief account as to why your skill set or experience is appropriate for the job. Keep in mind, this usually doesn&#x27;t work. You may have misunderstood what the job entails, or the decision maker may simply be unwilling to consider someone without a PhD (rightly or wrongly), or there may be a whole line of better candidates who all have PhDs.<p>You mention building &quot;something that goes beyond NASA&#x27;s Curiosity.&quot; This is a field that interests me, too. Most of the positions that actually build things are engineering or software. Most of them do not require PhDs, explicitly or otherwise. So, in short, I am not sure what position you are trying to get. If it involves building spacecraft, and asks for a PhD, it is almost certainly research, and it almost certainly really does require a PhD.",1371449740

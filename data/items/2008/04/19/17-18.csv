168069,comment,167255,167255,0,0,jward,,,"I've dropped 60lbs over the last year and over half of that was within the first two months.  All I did was be mindful of my weight and convince myself that losing it was important.  From there I just stopped eating as much crap and bought an exercise bike and made a simple rule.  If I'm not watching tv / movies with friends, I'm on my bike.<p>As a note of interest, if you do nothing but watch all the star trek episodes and ride an exercise bike with minimal effort you will end up burning over 50 fat-lbs worth of calories.  I still haven't made it through the first series I picked yet ;)",1208626947

I'm just learning git but the nerdhype seems strongly justified with this one :)",1208626770

I learned this in my first year at college and I like it better and better the more I work with it. It seems that Lisp is much more common, though. Any ideas why that's the case?",1208625958

They exist in economies where it doesn't make sense to provide this, if they were to have full benefits as we have it wouldn't scale with their cost and they would either go out of business or not be able to employ as many people, thus some people would be unemployed while some would enjoy great benefits, which seems even more ""unfair""",1208625750

U of T was close to home so I would be able live at home, and be able to afford it. With Waterloo I would have had to work for 6 months to save money for first year, and then work part time during school to afford the rest.<p>I was an arrogant little bastard and didn't want to settle for U of T. So I picked Waterloo.\nIt was tough, but I still think it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",1208625684

They absolutely dominate in quality and skill at producing electronics, most of the high grade lcd panels in the world are produced there.<p>You are suggesting that Americans buy panels manufactured in the US.  I have no idea what the benefit to this would be.  Worse panels at a higher price?  What does this solve?  It would create unsustainable and irrational employment.<p>The way to solve economic downturn is not to close your borders like you suggest.  That is the self-centered and naive way of thinking.  The way to improve your economic situation is through innovation and wealth creation.",1208624978

168046,comment,166905,166905,0,0,yason,,,"Maybe the emotions come for a purpose. I think they try to wake you up into realizing that you're not a 100% efficient coding/working machine and if you expect yourself to go to work and then work on your business (as I understood by your reference to ""your spare hours"" and to ""(emotional) problems""), you're trapped by your own expectations. Maybe doing the emotion track for at least a couple of days a week would be a good thing.<p>I sometimes don't get anything done, sometimes I get so much done. I've myself just learned to not expect much when I'm not in the flow and lacking the motivation and gut feeling to actually do the work I want to do. Things come, things go -- maybe I'll learn the following day that what I tried to do was eventually not needed. Or the following day might bring me the energy to start working on it, if it's the right thing to do at the time. If I tried to just execute through every single day, I'd be saturated with frustration by now.",1208624532

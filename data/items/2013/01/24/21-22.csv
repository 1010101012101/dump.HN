It does not factor in the increased amount of money going to their HMO (some of which is then sent as a dividend to GMO stockholders, there's a racket...)  It also does not factor in that people have to spend more on their own training and college education just to make the same wages as someone without these things could make at a factory in 1950.  You would be correct in saying food prices have fallen in the past 60 years, but their claims that the middle class now has more disposable income is false.<p>The fact which they can not deny is that inflation-adjusted hourly wages have fallen since the early 1970s.  Many of the points they make are sophistic.  They do make the point that commercial airplane travel has improved since the 1970s, but how often does the average middle class person use that?

Slaves were bought and sold, and didn't have the right to choose to work (or not), or for whom. Slaves were not afforded the right to participate in democratic process.<p>Middle-class Americans are not restricted the way slaves were. A middle-class American is not restricted by law from deciding not to work, or for pursuing other career opportunities.  They are allowed to vote.  They are allowed to travel freely, and choose where they will live.  To own property.<p>The thing that truly separated slaves from free people was not an income gap.  It was that slaves were legally restricted from living like free people.<p>The concern will rise if and when middle class people are truly institutionally restricted from participating in society.  If they were to institute policies to say only people with net worth over some value, or only landowners were allowed to vote.  Or if laws were passed solely based on the lobby of big business to the detriment of the majority opinion.  Or if people were legally restricted from changing jobs, or forced by law to work.<p>Some of these things are actually coming to pass. Particularly the manipulation of government and law by the very wealthy.  The greater the income gap becomes, the more legislative power the wealthy have.  The more legislative power the wealthy have, the easier it becomes for them to change the laws to maintain that power.  When that power becomes enshrined in law, then we can start comparing the middle class to slaves.<p>We're not there yet, but I think there are people with a lot of wealth who would much rather see us there than lose their wealth.",1359063834

But... that's not what I'm talking about, below.<p>--<p>Appearance.<p>Many of us are familiar with the advantages ""attractive"" people accrue in various situations (including employment, not infrequently -- speaking generally).<p>Well, appearance matters also in matters of attendance.  (And dress, and a few other things, for that matter.)<p>If you aren't in your chair during the ""prescribed"" hours, your boss may feel it makes them look bad.  And, they may be right.  Whether ""timely attendance"" improves your actual performance may be secondary to this concern, from the organization's perspective.<p>(Many here might argue it's actually counter-productive to their performance.  But... that's not primary to the organization.  Yep, that's right -- it's not primary to the organization.)<p>Plus, they may well think that ""if we do it for one person, we'll have to do it for all people"".<p>Ever notice how organizations are very circumspect about what they pay their employees?  (I mean, particularly, <i>within</i> the organization.  And yes, the question is largely rhetorical.)<p>Well, it's similar with hours.  Only, other employees can ""see"" the ""allowances"" made to you.  The organization is afraid they'll start asking for -- or insisting upon -- the same.<p>At which point, you need a significantly different organizational model -- one that can handle flex hours and/or offsite workers and all that.<p>They're not going to tackle that, just for your.  And many managements won't tackle it until they're dragged into it, kicking and screaming.  (Business management, for the most part, is a very <i>conservative</i> activity and mindset.)<p>P.S.  Personally, I've watched many employees talk away literally hours of their workdays -- chitchat with coworkers, on the cell phone, etc.  And I've cleaned up a lot of their messes.<p>But, they were in their chairs on time, and they ""tried"".  And they towed the line -- whatever line -- their managers espoused.  And that was often, ultimately, more valued and rewarded than high, but non-standard, performance.<p>P.P.S.  I guess one might think or argue that when hours are formally negotiated, the provides some explanation and shelter for the boss.<p>However, many organizations don't provide middle management with the authority to negotiate hours.  And... I recall from my own experience more than one memo coming down from senior management that stated the likes of:  ""No more virtual work plans""; ""Acceptable starting hour range changed from [this range] to [smaller range]""; etc.<p>It may be ""easier"" to pay you more (or less) -- generally non-public or non-publicized information -- than to let you be consistently absent when others are expected to be present.<p>Appearance.",1359063582

The purpose that a database serves is a good replacement for other kinds of IPC. It imparts meaning to data and allows applications to communicate in a common way.<p>Think about it this way: every language has a different way of representing some missing value -- null, nil, undef, Nothing, None -- and all are slightly different. But the application is probably influenced by SQL NULL semantics more than any of those.

Yes the dollar value of middle class wages have always gone up but it's still a big problem if they haven't risen in line with inflation or the overall growth of the economy. Economic gains are not sustainable if the middle class doesn't have the buying power to keep up with it. One reason our recovery has been so slow is that the gains from when our economy was exploding did not trickle down to the middle class which in turn did not create the demand needed to bring the economy back. The right likes to say that businesses aren't hiring because of regulations or economic/tax uncertainty. But the fact is if the demand was there, they'd be hiring left and right. The middle class just isn't capable of providing that demand right now.<p>He is also ignoring the effects of the average households going from 1 working adult to 2. Obviously, when household income doubles that family will have much more spending power to buy expensive i-devices.

5112339,comment,5111936,5111936,5,0,CleanedStar,,,"In the early 1970s, WSJ writers could have written an article pointing at how much better the middle class in the US had done over the past 40 years.  Now they have to resort to this sophistry.  When they admit the average hourly wage of nonsupervisory workers has remained about the same, what that actually means it is lower than it was in the early 1970s, adjusted for inflation.<p>So one point they make is workers are paying more to their HMOs than ever, so the % of fringe benefits to wages has increased.  This is proof against a stagnant middle class?<p>Then that a one income household can not cut it any more is mentioned.  What does this have to do with a stagnant middle class?  ""The U.S. economy was [and is] flexible and strong"".  No kidding, I can see GNP going up as well.  This has nothing to do with a stagnant (falling, actually) middle class.<p>The mention of 32% of disposable income - again, money is going to HMOs that went to nicer housing, cars, clothes etc.  Also, I don't know what NBER report they're citing, those numbers look much lower than other reports I have seen.  To believe this you would have to believe the middle class today has 68% play money with the 32% covering housing, cars and essentials.<p>""Joe Six-Pack when making a similar trip on a commercial jetliner. But unlike his 1970s counterpart, Joe routinely travels the same great distances in roughly the same time as do the world's wealthiest tycoons.""<p>I know many people in their 20s and 30s with middle class jobs, many of them have never been on an airline ever.  that airplanes have been improved means little to them.<p>The article sounds like just a lot of sophistry.  The fact is that inflation-adjusted hourly wages are lower today than they were in the early 1970s. Even if you don't give a flying fuck about the average American, it means there are less consumers to buy new commodities coming out.  They can go into debt to get it, but we all just saw what happened when the whole system is gamed so that these now poorer middle class people can buy houses with sub-prime mortgages.<p>Personally I don't have a Robert Reich/Paul Krugman/Keynesian view of this.  My personal view is the economic system has much greater essential underlying weaknesses that little Keynesian measures won't fix over the long run.  Which is just to say that just because I think Boudreaux and Perry are wrong doesn't mean I think Reich's suggested minor tweaks to the economy would work either.",1359062804

The delivery delays that were seen yesterday is because we choose consistency over availability in our systems.<p>In fact, most of the outages I see people complain about on Hacker News related to Gmail are because we won't sacrifice consistency of user accounts.  It's a different problem than huge scale serving of web search indexes or facebook timelines because in those cases if you're missing a few entries most people won't notice or care.  When you're searching for an email, you know what email you expect to find and you'll get angry if it isn't there.<p>Users won't stand for an email showing up one day, disappearing next hour, and then coming back later (which is what could happen in some designs for eventual consistency when serving from different datacenters).<p>Thus, Gmail availability is lower sometimes because we make sure that all of your data is there all the time. We're insane about it, and we have huge jobs that run constantly on our systems to ensure that we're even resilient to bad hardware.  With those we regularly find single bit errors and bad CPUs.<p>So, as a Gmail engineer, I'm sorry that there were delivery delays yesterday, and all I can say is that every time these happen we tweak and redesign our systems to make these more rare and to improve Gmail's uptime.

Both offer a nice scripting environment, and while Node is more web-oriented, there's still quite a bit of libraries out there to do stuff with, making it potentially perfectly suitable for writing an utility for doing <i>X</i>. Hell, I personally even consider it somewhat more attractive than Python in this regard because Node has no equivalent to the 2.X/3.X compatibility mess that Python has. (Python wins in having more ""general purpose"" libraries, though, making it potentially more suitable for not-directly-web-related-development in nature.)<p>And while this was mentioned a few times in the previous thread, it bears repeating again: There are quite a lot of people out there using Windows, <i>which includes developers</i>. Node is a first-class citizen on Windows, and grep, sed and friends won't be there out of the box for you. A properly done Node command-line utility is generally more cross-platform than a shell script using grep and sed would.

5112208,comment,5111073,5111304,2,0,csense,,,"> prisons are not real punishment<p>I think Aaron Swartz would disagree.<p>> punishing them with the clear intention of feeling good in some way<p>This plays some role, but I'd say the biggest reason people give in favor of having prisons is rational:  Deterrence.  If crimes aren't punished, what stops people from stealing when they want something they can't afford?  What stops the strong from beating up the weak for fun, for profit, or as a way to resolve disputes in their favor?  What stops the weak from shooting the strong because they finally get tired of being beaten up?  What reason is there to adhere to contracts and agreements necessary for effective commerce if it would be more beneficial to one party to break them?<p>If you agree that punishment is necessary, but prison is somehow deficient as a punishment, what's the alternative?  The punishment has to be sufficiently undesirable to cause most people to avoid crime in order to avoid the punishment.  In addition, if it's going to be implemented in the US, it can't be cruel and unusual punishment since that is strictly Constitutionally prohibited, and if it's going to be implemented in a relatively free and democratic society, it has to show respect for generally accepted human rights principles.  This excludes solutions like lashing, waterboarding, more extreme torture, massive expansions of the death penalty (I believe England as late as the 1500's would hang homeless children for stealing clothes to keep warm in the winter), or collective punishment (punishing someone else instead of or in addition to a criminal, e.g. many authoritarian regimes are willing to punish opponents by jailing, torturing, and/or killing their innocent friends, relatives, and children).<p>I do think that US criminal justice could be better.  Currently many crimes are punished too harshly, sometimes sentences are inconsistent, current implementation of plea bargaining sometimes leads to terrible injustices, public defenders are woefully underfunded, the education system doesn't do a good job of covering these issues, and life is far too difficult for people after a felony conviction (discrimination against workers with felony records is legal and widespread; this sort of discrimination shouldn't be illegal, but culturally we need to be more willing to let people have second chances).",1359061512

5112177,comment,5111432,5111660,7,0,gojomo,,,"Many of the analogies used to explain Bitcoin are, unfortunately, misleading. Saying 'each bitcoin', for example, as if it were a tangible collectable, introduces a bunch of associations that aren't helpful for understanding.<p>Instead, think of Bitcoin as a giant consensus accounting ledger. Everyone can see which crypto-signing-keys have the right to spend which balances. (The balances happen to be measured in an integral unit called a 'satoshi', and 100,000,000 of these satoshis equal ""1 BTC""... but these are tallies in a ledger mapping key-identities to available-spending-balances, <i>not</i> rare collectables.)<p>Given that, a person's Bitcoin holdings are simply numerical totals which, at the direction of their signing keys, can be handed in full or part to other signing keys. But it works like having a bank balance at a shared ""bank in the cloud"", massively replicated, with no single authority or point-of-failure, where everyone can see every transfer. (Balance transfers are public announcements, <i>not</i> the secure sending of a rare secret.)<p>So bitcoin balances are valued with regard to $USD (or other currencies) like other foreign-currency bank balances - who's willing to buy it, for how much, compared to who's willing to sell, for how much. That is, yes, ""supply and demand"", but based directly on the willingness of holders/seekers to transact, and only indirectly on the total 'supply' in existence.<p>That the price has run up indicates that holders of current bitcoin balances want more $USD to give it up, and that seekers are offering more $USD to get it. Every day more people hear about Bitcoin, and slowly and slightly (because it's pretty complicated and different) come to understand it better. Also, using a heuristic common for new technologies, people only believe something new will survive after seeing it survive for a while. [1]<p>From my perspective, heists and scams are <i>good</i> for Bitcoin, because they're providing a trial-by-fire and accelerated-education in various economic, security, and usability topics for anyone involved (or just watching from the sidelines). Things that took decades or centuries to work out in traditional economic systems will be resolved in months or years, and with countermeasures optimized for today, not the 18th/19th/20th centuries.<p>[1] See for example Nassim Nicholas Taleb on the 'Lindy Effect': <a href=""http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/12/worlds-not-ending-but-technologys-aging-backwards/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/opinion/2012/12/worlds-not-ending-but-t...</a>",1359061217

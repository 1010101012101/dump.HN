With all this time spent trying to avoid lawsuits, I sometimes wonder how people in the US manage to be productive at all.<p>Anyway, your arguments seems to boil down to that any platform which isn't under 100% open source control is a risky investment and that it's not worth it.

They do download packages or binaries with installers, or perhaps add a repo, but then, as you point out, an MS app store would not rule out downloading or purchasing elsewhere.<p>I agree with your other points.<p>It would also be very difficult to set up the deals with enough other vendors for it to be worthwhile. I can imagine many of them not being happy relying on a single channel.<p>Also, the presence of software on CDs in shops is good marketing for MS - a major objection to MacOS and Linux is ""I cannot buy software for it in the shops around here"".<p>If they excluded open source, it would reduce what is available.

623415,comment,623381,623381,0,0,trezor,,,"Because, just like Mac users, Linux* users and users everywhere which has a full rich user-interface, not a minimal mobile interface, they like to be able to get applications from any source, not just one central location.<p>While the Apple AppStore no doubt is successful, Apple has most definitely proven just how bad that idea works out in practice, and how trying to control it effectively leads to inconsistent censorship leading developers to either hold back on ideas or spend programming effort which could have been spent making their applications better, to make sure it complies with the store-policies. I can just picture updates & security updates lagging behind 2 months because the application needs reapproval.<p>No thanks. I'll just google, download a setup.exe and run the app thank you very much.<p>Now you might argue ""How would you know that this download is safe and properly QAed?"". That could be a fair point. But given how badly Apple has handled the AppStore with its rather limited set of applications, imagine if Microsoft were all of a sudden tasked to deal with the entire back-catalog of Windows software out there.<p>Do you honestly believe that could be reasonably QAed without Microsoft spending millions, millions and more millions in the process? And if they didn't people wouldn't bother using the store, since ""I find all the software I need with google, and nothing with this AppStore thing"".<p>Microsoft is making a pretty good move doing nothing here.<p>* Yes I know about package-management, repositories, etc etc. That still doesn't cut the need to custom compile applications from various non-official sources every now and then.",1243084589

However, this is all relative. While we worked with our hands in the sense that the author means, we did it with machinery.  My grandfather farmed using horses. I know he thought that working with horses was ""closer to truth"" than driving a tractor.  I am sure that my Dad would not want to go back.<p>So we no longer gap our own spark plugs, fix our own broken rear springs, replace our own tires, weld our own truck beds.  Has something gone out of the world? Yes.  Is the answer to teach every city kid how to use a pair of pliers?  Can't hurt, but that does not lead to an appreciation of the fullness of a life based manual labor.",1243084466

They really want people like Amazon to be on there side otherwise they might stop selling Windows software and start pushing Mac. In addition Microsoft probably wouldn't ship applications that they saw as serious competitors and would get a lot of legal hassle.<p>Apple's iPhone store only makes sense in the sense that it is simple for users to get software. In the long term I think it's anti-competitive and stupid, since there should be a Amazon store and various other stores that compete with each other.

Some others instead, might become better professionals by learning how to code. Different people, different skills, and they can both work on the web very efficiently in both small and big teams. :)<p>I love the attitude you express in the third paragraph. We need way more people willing to teach and support others understanding them. :)",1315047473

2957076,comment,2956185,2956921,10,0,rwmj,,,"tomjen3 is literally correct that the system call interface used here (int $0x80) still works.<p>However the system call interface used by most Linux programs today is different in two important respects:<p>(1) Most(?) current Linux programs run on x86-64 and I'm not sure if int $0x80 is even implemented for this architecture.  Whether or not it's implemented, it is not the one which is used normally.  Programs use a special 'syscall' instruction:<p><a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/blob/HEAD:/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/x86_64/syscall.S"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/blob/HEAD:/sysdeps/unix/sysv/l...</a><p>(2) Even on 32 bit i?86, int $0x80 has not been used by ordinary compiled programs for a long time.  This is because software interrupts were discovered to be very slow, since all registers are saved whether you need to or not.  There are faster methods to enter the kernel now.  Originally the replacement was to use the Intel 'sysenter' instruction.  This was slow too.  It was replaced by a ""call gate"" via %gs, see ENTER_KERNEL here:<p><a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/blob/HEAD:/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/sysdep.h#l187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://repo.or.cz/w/glibc.git/blob/HEAD:/sysdeps/unix/sysv/l...</a><p>I think modern code on 32 bit ix86 now uses 'syscall' where available.  It's hard to keep up, and a detail that doesn't matter for anyone except a handful of kernel and glibc hackers.",1315047354

That's not to say Java can't do what you want, but you might find it's better designed for tackling large abstract problems than algorithmic and mathematical ones.<p>For example, check out this list of people who have completed 250 or more problems (only works if you're logged in): <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=scores&show=veterans"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=scores&show=ve...</a><p>Correlation isn't causation and all that, but this shows you the tools that the people who finish all the problems want to use are, in order, C/C++, Python, Java, and Mathematica.<p>In the end, though, it's really a question of what your goal is. If you want to learn Java, then learn Java (but I would consider learning it using problems better suited to it). If you want to solve Project Euler problems, you'll have your work cut out for you just figuring out good algorithms; it's best to do it in the language that will give you the least trouble.<p>Incidentally, while Python automatically turns large numbers into digit arrays, if you stick with Java you might find its equivalent BigInteger class useful: <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1,5.0/docs/api/java/math/B...</a>",1315044465

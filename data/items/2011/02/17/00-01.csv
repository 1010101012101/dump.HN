2229158,comment,2228419,2228419,0,0,rauljara,,,"If the basic argument is that apple's margin are too high, I agree completely.  They are a massively profitable company; they don't need to be charging what they're charging.<p>If the argument is that there is something immoral about them charging people for use of their subscription service, I call bullshit.  Until incredibly recently, they had no subscription service.  Now they are offering the _option_ to use a subscription service.  If you find the fees are too high, you are not obliged to take part in it.  I think the real reason this upsets so many is that it clearly is worth it for many developers to take part in it, just like it clearly is worth it to let apple take their 30% cut for everything else sold on the app store.  People are riled because they don't want to have to pay apple this fee, but hard cold business logic demands that they should, because it is profitable to do so (or less unprofitable than not doing so).  It wouldn't be threatening at all if you felt like you could afford to just walk away from the ecosystem apple's built.<p>Which seems to indicate they are adding value.<p>Now, as to whether the value added == 30%, I direct you to the first paragraph.  But what's the motivation to create such a wonderfully easy to use ecosystem if you can't derive a profit off it?",1297904387

2229146,comment,2228419,2228873,0,0,darren_,,,"> all their music, movies, apps, etc are in Apple's DRM format and won't transfer to other devices.<p>Music on iOS devices isn't DRMed and hasn't been for some time. If your new device can't play m4a files this is a separate issue and you can transcode them just like if you had a pile of drm-free WMAs.<p>Apps are DRMed but even if they weren't it'd be irrelevant unless a WINE-analogue for iOS came about (and consider the time-scale this would take and performance issues, etc. UIKit is non-trivial). I can't move an Android app onto my iPhone either, despite its lack of DRM, and whether the blocker is legal or technical is irrelevant. The real problem isn't that a user can't move their 99c iOS whatever-app to their new android phone, it's that they can't find or don't know how to find or can't be bothered finding equivalent app(s) for their new phone. Leaving aside the whole question of relative top-tier application quality on the platforms.<p>Movies, I don't know the behaviour here. Do people collect big libraries of apple DRM-ed movies, enough to keep them stuck to a phone? TV episodes I could see, but those strike me as more disposable in any case.<p>What is the 'etc' in ""music, movies, apps, etc""? It's not your photos. It's not your emails. It's not your calendars or your contacts. It's not even the data saved in your applications - there's a trivial API now for transferring files from an application to your desktop via iTunes; if you can't export the data from your favourite applications to transfer to a different platform, that's on the application developers, not Apple.<p>I suppose it could be your alarms, preferred weather cities and stocks app choices. Or your SMS database, which I bet most people don't even consider as something that should easily transfer from phone to phone (though obviously it should).",1297904075

TV shows and movies are another matter and have other issues (such as only one download), which is why I won't buy them from there.<p>But it's not Apple demanding DRM. It's the content producers, who are still until the woeful delusion that DRM prevents copying. In reality it simply annoys customers. The only reason music is DRM-free on iTunes is because Apple extracted that concession as part of a deal that gave the RIAA three pricing bands for songs ($0.69, $0.99 and $1.29, which basically means $1.29 for anything new) over the previous model, which was $0.99 for everything.",1297903934

The walled-garden guy could care less about that. Now he can <i>say</i> that he only has the best interests of the customer in mind -- that's why his walls are so high.

The iOS Linode utility app is of value to me as a user, but it's a tiny part of what I get out of Linode, so it in no way seems reasonable for Apple to demand that Linode now allow sign-ups through the iOS app and hand over 30% of the monthly fee for those sign-ups. I'm not on Linode because of the iOS app, I'm on iOS because of useful utilities like the Linode app.<p>So when most of these useful add-on utilities are driven off the store by this crazy land-grab, users like me are going to be driven right off the platform as well.",1297902978

I'll just add 2 comments:<p>1) Regarding the fact that at any given time, there is knowledge that people have that hasn't been encoded in a form usable by the optimizer: I think this can be addressed by generating a set of decent designs with machine learning (on the pareto front, if you will) and then providing user interface tools to allow the humans to pick the designs that best handle the knowledge that wasn't optimized against. These user interfaces will often have to be quite elaborate but that's a tractable problem.<p>2) When working with Genetic Algorithms, and any machine learning technology, really, my experience has been that the first results only show what is wrong with the problem setup. The designs that are returned by a genetic algorithm are invariably nonsense at first and the then it's a matter of playing whack-a-mole as the optimizer exploits inaccuracies in the problem statement, a fix is made, a new exploit is found, repeat. This is often viewed as a deficiency of genetic algorithms but in my opinion the fact that the metrics being used can be gamed is valuable information that needs to be addressed as early as possible.<p>Finally, I understand my original comment came across as somewhat naive. If we ever get to a point where we can design physical products, I am imagining starting with something along the lines of a mechanical pocket watch, or maybe a nice desk chair.

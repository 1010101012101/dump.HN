The reason I picked GTD is because it seemed reasonable and other people claimed success with it; I didn't want to waste a ton of time evaluating methodologies. Similarly, there are a lot of productivity tools (especially software); I spent WAY too much time evaluating them, but only because each of them suck in their own special way. I think now I'm simply going to use Outlook 2003; I can't access it from the internet but I can sync with my phone which in many ways is even better.",1177160207
15455,comment,15030,15450,0,0,bls,,,"I just started using GTD-like techniques. The basics of it are this: (1) write everything down as you think of it, so you don't forget anything. (2) very often, go through the list of random items; do the small (two minute) tasks immediately, and organize the rest of them into into (groups of) ""next actions."" (3) spend all the rest of your time eliminating items from the ""next actions"" list.<p>I think it is effective. There were many times when I let a lot of email pile up in my inbox. Now, I very deliberately go through my email and respond to everything ASAP; everything that I can't do immediately gets filed away in a TODO list so I don't forget it. My inbox is thus ALWAYS empty. I don't know why but that makes me happy. It also makes other people happy because they are getting their responses faster. And, I get more done because having a list of ""the next thing I need to do"" makes me want to do things to get them off the list.<p>The other thing I found to be helpful is to schedule all my distractions. Now, I have a reminder that tells me ""hey, check your email"" and even ""hey, check your feed reader."" This seems silly, but it is really helpful; I know that I will get the ""check your feed reader"" reminder soon, so I just keep working until it comes. Sometimes, I get annoyed and refuse (!) to check my email because I'm busy; in fact, I had started with scheduling them hourly but I am slowly reducing it down to three times per day. As a result, I check my email and weblogs WAY less frequently than I did before (even with an hourly reminder), because before I would check my email basically in between each item on my TODO list or even in the middle of something.",1177160007

15449,comment,15449,9770,0,0,Rares,,,"Hey Paul,<p>Just because Microsoft sucks right now in Internet stuff and is not that flashy like the cute AJAX startups (who are dying like flies), doesn't means too much, we need to see how the winds are blowing:<p>a. You can't build an Office with AJAX. AJAX is too hard to program, relative to the functionality you get out of it. Heh, I am sure I will get a lot of smiles for this. The keyword is ""relative"". Btw, I have been doing AJAX in 2001, and it sucked big time.<p>To build a WebOffice, you need something much more reliable, faster and powerful than the shitty JavaScript. A development environment with static compile time checking, better control of machine resources, faster. A FLASHy virtual machine for example.<p>Google Apps (Sheets and Docs) are nothing more than toys, and they are locked in pit. They cannot grow larger than they currently are in an incremental manner.<p>It is a pity Google did not snatch Macromedia, for lack of vision. Now Microsoft is building their own lightweight virtual machine, for exactly this purpose: deliver large scale apps to the web.<p>b. .NET binding to the OS (the binding of Windows GUI to .NET 3.0). That's the single most aggresive move I have ever seen from a company. It goes like this: we are a monopolist of the OS market. Should you want to develop for our OS (which you must), you MUST use our developments tools and proprietary languages, which do not work on any other OSes. The monopoly is self-reinforcing, with one more leg added. The plan of the MS new boss is far-fetched (they mentioned 10 years), but it is sound.<p>The seeds are in place and the wind is blowing Microsoft's way, just give them time to grow.<p>So, I will start to respect Google's strategy the moment they push for the control of their underlying platform, making that little virtual machine.<p>Regards,
Rares

I'm saying that the reason for their success is not their own merit, but this random butterfly effect described in the linked study. It's a relevant discussion to have, since it indicates that there's a limit on how much you can control your own destiny in a social startup. ",1177157881

You get a new machine with a new version of Windows, and then you spend a lot of time trying to get all of your files moved over and your programs working again. And then, after all that -- the user interface looks different. Things have moved around. You'll have to spend some time learning how to use your computer again.<p>Meanwhile, the perception among Apple users is that they can put in a disk, run an installer, and they get to upgrade their old hardware to run the new thing. There might be a few user interface differences, but most of them are subtle. They don't have to learn how to use their computer all over again, and somehow it's better now.<p>In both cases, the perception isn't quite reality, but that doesn't matter.

In particular, the ergonomics are also consistent.<p>The issue with phones is that ergonomics can make or break your app, and that is dictated entirely by fixed hardware. Do you have only a touch screen? A keyboard? keyboard + touch screen? What about physical screen size and resolution? Your application will technically <i>run</i> on every combination of that hardware, but the end-user experience may suffer.<p>Those ergonomic issues impact the end-user in a huge way. If you've ever watched someone with a Blackberry (with a trackball) use an iphone optimized website, it's usable but not as efficient as using a touch screen. There's often no way around these limitations for the end-user other than getting a new device.<p>Mobile devices will eventually mature and converge toward common hardware and input technologies, but until that happens cross-device work is going to be a real challenge.",1255696504

885231,comment,885107,885197,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I don't think there are that many viable outliers; this sounds like the ""if just 1% of X people, and just 1% of those ..."" argument that some young businesses use as their market research.<p>Let's consider some of the demographics and logic here. First, we're specifically talking about XP users. Vista has been available for quite a while, and despite all the bad press and the vehement hatred that the tech sector has for it -- a lot of users aren't all that bothered by it. It works OK.<p>So, if someone is still using XP, then it's probably safe to conclude that either they're apprehensive of change, or that they don't consider their computer to be something that they should spend much money on.<p>In both cases, Apple loses at converting them. Macs are more expensive, and the operating system is completely different from the user's perspective.<p>The only outliers that leaves us with is those folks that have more than one computer in their home, of which one or more of their systems is XP. In those cases, either they already have a Mac in their home -- and Apple isn't winning a conversion -- or they don't, and Apple is not really likely to get a conversion.<p>But all that's just theory and guessing. Fortunately, one of my two businesses currently is in tech services for individuals and businesses. Of the roughly probably 100 systems that we currently care for, just 9 of them are Macs. Of those, 7 are used by people who will give up their Macs when you pry them from their cold, dead fingers. (Which is fine by us, we like -- and support -- Macs too.) Of the remaining two, one is an older laptop with persistent hard drive and charging issues which almost drove the client to get a PC replacement.<p>The other one is a more interesting story related to what we're talking about here. The client was persuaded to get an Apple at the behest of a friend who really really likes Macs, and is one of those misguided evangelists that believes that everyone else should like them too.<p>The problem is, this client doesn't <i>play</i> with computers. He just wants to get work done. So, one of the first things he did with his Mac was get an early beta of Boot Camp -- and install Windows on it.<p>Apple since then has done this really neat trick where a bug in that version of Boot Camp prevents the user from upgraded to XP service pack 3, and you can't upgrade Boot Camp to fix the bug without buying Leopard.<p>Meanwhile, the user is frustrated as all hell because the machine is really quirky. He <i>hates</i> it. He just wants to get work done, not dick around with it all the time. To him, the Mac is always slower than his other PCs, it's always more troublesome, and it was more expensive.<p>As a result of that ""conversion"", Apple has just won an enemy for life. He'll never buy one again.<p>I used to do the whole ""you're better off with a Mac"" evangelism thing -- essentially doing Apple's marketing for them -- years ago. That got old pretty fast when all those people started coming back to me with complaints, and most of their complaints distilled down to, ""it's not Windows!""<p>Now we recommend people just use what they're familiar with. They're much happier that way.<p>The marketing strategies from both Microsoft and Apple right now are completely irrelevant to their prospective customers.",1255696467

If the attacker got physical access to the hardware there is very little you can do via software, given the architecture of normal computers. So the only thing that makes sense is to find a way to detect physical access, and currently the only one is to physically protect the computer itself.<p><i>Edit:</i> still there are a few tricks that can be done in theory. For instance to flash a new bios modified in order to write some data in a given sector of the disk if after the power up you don't press a special sequence of keys. This makes the owner able to detect if there was access to the PC, and because it's done in the BIOS even starting a different operating system from the CD will not avoid the detection.<p>This is security by obscurity, but can work against Maids.<p>Another simpler, less effective, but still better than nothing approach is to set a password in the BIOS.

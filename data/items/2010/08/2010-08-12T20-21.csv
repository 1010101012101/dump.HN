I personally greatly prefer the 2nd approach, e.g. Harvey Mudd has 1/3 general science/engineering core, 1/3 humanities/social-sciences, 1/3 your major. Contrast with many engineering schools, where your major takes up >2/3 of your courses, which I think is a rather oppressive way to do things.<p>It's possible there could be a school with fewer of <i>both</i> kinds of requirements, where students get a build-your-own-major sort of deal. But if we're going to choose between more general requirements or more per-major requirements, I greatly prefer the first: to me, the 2nd (""all CS majors must take systems, theory, databases, and 2 of the following 4 classes"") is a lot more compulsive, and generally results in useless specialist classes being added based on who's politically powerful within the department.",1281646152

I mean, personally I'm pretty bad at negotiation.  If it is something that really matters, I always  need to get multiple bids.   I mean, personally, I switch jobs fairly often, so I think that my old salary is usually pretty fair... saying ""I am making X now, beat that""  seems to work okay.  I am leaving some money on the table, yeah; The thing is, as an employee, there really isn't that much room to negotiate most places.   Especially larger companies have strict guidelines for pay for particular positions.   Even at smaller places, the boss is very conscious of perceived 'fairness' -  The boss might not like his employees talking about money, but he knows we do it anyhow.   The idea is that paying one worker more than another without an externally visible reason can be damaging to the business above and beyond the extra cash expended.<p>The problem is that the employee is at a /massive/ disadvantage, even if she is a good negotiator.    As an employee, you are applying for a job designed for people who are not primarily driven by money... and you are competing with other people who are also primarily not driven by money.  If you apply for a full-time employee position, you are saying that you don't really care that much about maximizing your cash return on your time... that's not what full time jobs are for.<p>Listen to all this talk of 'work-life balance'  -  most jobs are not designed for people who want to retire  at 30.  most jobs are designed to be comfortable enough that you can do them most of your life.   And really, that's what most people want.<p>It's easier to maximize cash as a contractor, 'cause people who value safety, stability and comfort leave contractor positions as soon as they can, leaving the field to the mercenary and the incompetent, so it's  a place where a competent mercenary can thrive.",1281645779

E.g. there are several ways to send texts.  There&#x27;s the issue of fragmentation.  The new Google Photos has embarrassing auto-tags for African-Americans.  Google has a solid whole product right now, but so did RIM.  They will need to push really hard on projects like Tango and Project Fi to compete in future markets.<p>* Nest is garnering a reputation for being untrustworthy due to absurd bugs like: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpsMkLaEiOY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpsMkLaEiOY</a><p>* Google is the most published self-driving car manufacturer, but w/out a shipping product they aren&#x27;t clearly a leader.  All early reviews of their car indicate that it&#x27;s currently too conservative.  There&#x27;s also an issue: do people actually <i>want</i> the whole product?  It looks like Tesla and Mercedes will very likely beat Google to market with core self-driving features.<p>I agree with parent-of-parent that Google appears to be trying to position itself more aggressively in many consumer product markets.  Google is an excellent technology company, but most of their products have been niche hits.  There&#x27;s plenty of room for their competitors to leverage better customer relationships to own good chunks of the markets that Google seeks to own.",1437119952

Chances are that your first Sudoku solver uses some bruteforce approach, while your manual solution certainly does not. Then the intuitions that you get from many manual games can drive the design of your solver. Of course you can implement some established algorithm but I don&#x27;t see that challenging.<p>I have mathematician friend who won&#x27;t ever play Nine Men&#x27;s Morris because it&#x27;s a solved game, so it&#x27;s not longer interesting for him.

Well, if you have the ethos of &quot;read all code&quot;, no matter the language, there are some where that is easy to do, and others where its a bit of a drag.<p>(Mostly, its the languages that have IDE support, or which attract insufficiently brain-dead people that they can actually use EMACS to get around.)<p>If all you have is a simple editor, though, there are some languages that truly shine, and C is thankfully still one of them.",1437119627

9901660,comment,9901480,9901530,0,0,acqq,,,"While technically true, this diagnosis is a bit misleading.<p>The question is &quot;Why is Flash so vulnerable?&quot; and the part of Patio&#x27;s answer is &quot;codebase in a non-memory-managed language.&quot; Well, practically everything we seriously use has the codebase in a non-memory-managed language.<p>All the common operating system guts -- written in a non-memory-managed language. All the common browsers guts -- written in a non-memory-managed language. Even the guts of the &quot;memory managed languages&quot; are -- written in a non-memory-managed language.<p>C and variations, and not memory managed. And nobody managed to replace C and dialects with something else. The Rust language will maybe manage to be used for something serious, already implementing the experimental layout engine but at the moment it&#x27;s still too hard even to replace the current Firefox engine with the one written in Rust. It&#x27;s a good thing that Rust and other developments exists, but in practice, C is still everywhere.<p>So Flash is not an exception in being written in C or the dialect of it. That some parts of some systems can be implemented in memory-managed languages is a very old thing, and it doesn&#x27;t protect them from exploits. Parts of Firefox are written in JavaScript. Even when something is written in Java (which is memory-managed) didn&#x27;t mean a thing, as recently Java code was the favorite attack vector (in spite of being &quot;virtual&quot; and &quot;memory managed&quot;).<p>Security is hard. Certainly, millions of dollars of security research and the implementation of their results help the most, more than &quot;it&#x27;s not memory managed&quot; as it is too simple an answer to be of much use in the given context.<p>So why then Flash? Because of many things, but specifically Flash brought to the browsers huge functionality which is still slowly being reimplemented in the form of the standard features of the browsers. Even ignoring the fact that they brought these features without too much external reviews, the only way to bring so much functionality to the huge infrastructures that existing browsers are was for Flash to cross a lot of boundaries. And the attacks are the boundary crossings, so piggybacking on what Flash does is often the best thing for an attacker to do. Then, the second cause is certainly that Flash codebase definitely didn&#x27;t receive enough attention to become safer. And the current reason is -- even Adobe doesn&#x27;t expect Flash to ever become something worth of too much investment.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve implemented one memory managed language in C. Behind almost every language mentioned anywhere is some non-memory-managed C. Simple &quot;a single island&quot; languages can be very clean and safe. Add the features, use of the system libraries, boundary crossings etc, and &quot;memory managed&quot; is just a small point.",1437119251

9901636,comment,9896590,9901602,0,0,jcrites,,,"True, but I think part of this is about shaping behavior, and about self-discipline. And perhaps also the cognitive bias that comes from knowing one&#x27;s own program well. A program I wrote always seems more obvious to me than it does to others. It seems to me that the mind, while aware of gaps in knowledge between ourselves and others, cannot fully compensate for this. It&#x27;s like Hofstadter&#x27;s law (&quot;It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter&#x27;s Law.&quot;)<p>So I don&#x27;t know if I fully trust myself to decide which type annotations are obvious up front. Though maybe I&#x27;m just used to this way of working. I&#x27;m not aware of many solid studies of the differences that move far beyond personal preference. Especially studies that measure the performance of teams over time (vs virtuoso performances). Also, how happy would you be as the maintainer of a codebase if a new guy came along and submitted a pull request which was purely the addition of an already-inferred type?<p>Type declarations tend to be pretty low effort for me, these days. The way that I write code in Eclipse works like this:<p><pre><code>  // I type out this part\n  f(x)\n</code></pre>\nThen I invoke auto-complete and ask Eclipse to automatically assign the expression to a new local variable or field. If f() doesn&#x27;t exist, I might ask it to create that method. It will infer part of the signature from the type of x. Once I write the method, I can auto-complete its return type. Or if the method exists, taking the type of the variable &quot;x&quot;, it can suggest that I probably want &quot;x&quot; as the parameter. I just type &quot;f(&quot; and invoke auto-complete. Anyway, once I ask it to assign to a variable, I end up with something like:<p><pre><code>  Foo foo = f(x);\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m given a choice of common variable names based on the type in question which are easy to choose between with good defaults. So most of the time I&#x27;m sort of minimally describing or hinting at what I want, and the IDE guesses extremely well what I mean -- better than a compiler ever could, because it&#x27;s allowed to make multiple guesses and be wrong -- and then I capture or snapshot that by saving it as text.<p>The type inference is actually <i>just as present</i> as in the other languages, it&#x27;s just happening up front at editing time, rather than at compile time. And these benefits don&#x27;t only apply during original composition. If I edit the method f() and change its return type, I can just as easily auto-complete (or more broadly, use automated refactoring for) the change to the type declaration for the &quot;foo&quot; variable.<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re a programmer of dynamic languages or heavily type-inferred languages, this will seem like &quot;much ado about nothing&quot;. &quot;Isn&#x27;t it the same in the end?&quot; The difference to me is that it&#x27;s all there in the text, and on the screen, by default; and it&#x27;s all comprehensible even without an IDE and without an understanding of <i>all</i> of the types involved. I still drop out of the IDE surprisingly often to read code at the command line or in a web browser.<p>I can also see where the alternative view is coming from though that, if I don&#x27;t have to define the type of variable &quot;foo&quot;, then I don&#x27;t have to change the text when &quot;f()&quot; changes. I would support a &quot;var&quot; keyword in Java, and agree the problem is really about when type inference goes too far.

9901568,comment,9896590,9901384,0,0,jcrites,,,"Type inference can make the code easier to write. But, is the code easier to read, and overall less effort for the business? Code tends to be read significantly more than it&#x27;s written. This is a simplification but seems to be true enough; modification by subsequent maintainers involves a lot of reading.<p>I worry about features like overuse of type inference when it means the types in question aren&#x27;t explicit from the code that you&#x27;re reading (agreed, not all type inference involves overuse). For example, if I write:<p><pre><code>  var x = f();\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s the type of x? What&#x27;s the return value of f? I can answer those questions, certainly, but I have to go look for the answer. I don&#x27;t immediately have any mental concept or name to hang the idea off of. Whereas in a language like Java, I&#x27;d end up writing:<p><pre><code>  Foo x = f();\n</code></pre>\nNow I know the return value is a &quot;Foo&quot;. This may not seem like much, but suddenly if there are many different Foos in the code, I can see the patterns I didn&#x27;t see before, and I can draw correlations:<p><pre><code>  Foo x = f();\n  Foo y = g();\n  h(x,y);\n</code></pre>\nEverything can always be understood with a degree of thought, but type annotations seem to, in my experience, make programs a lot easier to read and modify. The original authors typically have the whole thing in their head, so it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to them, but it can be a huge difference for those who come after.<p>There&#x27;s a certain simplicity that comes from types that are so concrete, clearly named, and linkable as Java libraries are. You can figure out something about this code without reading the declaration or definition:<p><pre><code>  ListenableFuture<String> emailAddress = user.queryEmailAddress();\n</code></pre>\nYou have a pointer for what to search for and an immediate name for the concept. I suppose it&#x27;s like an index, in a way. An index to make code more readable and referenceable is included throughout. It&#x27;s hard to explain it, but I find this valuable even when I have support from a sophisticated IDE. (Plus I&#x27;m often working outside an IDE.)<p>Including these types is more time consuming up front than languages that support type inference, or are dynamic, but for long-lived applications it seems like the overall tradeoff is usually worth it. To be fair, I haven&#x27;t maintained any F# applications. If the type inference is purely saving annotations that are completely obvious even to a beginner to the codebase, then I could see that being worth it. (It seems to me that we are all beginners to the codebase in meaningfully large platforms.) The actual act of typing the annotations is also often pretty easy and handled automatically by the IDE, but I suppose you have that experience with C#.",1437116819

Most of the things you said are MVC and SRP, it has nothing to do with SPA, this is what I have been trying to explain. SPA stands for &quot;Single Page Application&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t specify anything beyond that, your code could be utter garbage with everything mangled together, and it&#x27;s still technically a SPA. MVC on the other hand does specify how to organize your code.<p>I think the problem here is the SPA terminology itself and the way it&#x27;s being used and marketed.",1437116578

However it is possible that they need an SEO manager to help them with other search engines beside&#x27;s their own. Perhaps they are trying to capture additional marketshare (despite being obvious market leaders) from the smaller guys!",1437116442

However, that does not mean that you can&#x27;t have a dynamic type system in a compiled language, or vice versa.<p>Also, if you add type inference, the examples given for variables in dynamic languages are perfectly valid examples for variables in a language with a static type system (the type would just be defined on first assignment).",1437116400

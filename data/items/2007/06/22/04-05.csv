Third best is a medium-scale (e.g. Viaweb) acquisition.  Getting bought early is the least attractive option to investors except going out of business.",1182488063
29980,comment,29919,29944,0,0,pg,,,"Actually the startups we've funded have a whole range of ambitions.  Some would sell early if they could; others are bent on world domination (like Loopt).<p>I don't know why everyone seems to think we encourage founders to sell early.  Like all venture investors, we make more money if founders <i>don't</i> sell early, and instead keep trying to grow the company.  We can afford more risk than founders can.  The difference between us and most other venture investors is that we don't forbid founders to sell early, if they really want to.  But surely you can see that it would be more in our interest if they all tried to be the next Google?",1182487800

A good partner can be a great reality check, in a way no one else could. This is probably the biggest single advantage for me because I can be dangerously stubborn on occasion.\n",1182486500

To the contrary, founders may well be in a hurry to scale UP, which you certainly can do when acquired by the right company, like Google (as you know).<p>And ""<i>maybe</i> we'll sell""?  Who are ""they"" kidding?",1182485428

6588179,comment,6585828,6588064,3,0,pcwalton,,,"OK, so we agree that this is serious, and we need to make sure that programmers understand whether 32-bit or 64-bit arithmetic is being performed, lest the bridge collapses.<p>In Rust a programmer familiar with the rules would write it this way, making it clear what&#x27;s happening:<p><pre><code>    bridge.d = (bridge.a as f64 * bridge.b as f64 + bridge.c as f64) as f32;
</code></pre>
Taking advantage of the implicit conversions, a programmer familiar with C++&#x27;s rules might write:<p><pre><code>    bridge.d = bridge.a * bridge.b + bridge.c;
</code></pre>
Now suppose that, years later, someone comes along and wants to refactor the code by adding a temporary. In Rust:<p><pre><code>    let tmp = bridge.a as f64 * bridge.b as f64;
    bridge.d = (tmp + bridge.c as f64) as f32;
</code></pre>
In C++:<p><pre><code>    auto tmp = bridge.a * bridge.b;
    bridge.d = tmp + bridge.c;
</code></pre>
And now they&#x27;ve changed the meaning of the code in a serious way, because adding a temporary silently changes the meaning of the code.",1382389148

I am working on an app that has the chicken/egg problem where it can&#x27;t make money straight away, it needs a strong user base to be effective.<p>I have been working on this app for the past year it seems like, with development really amping up in the last 6 months. We just brought on another developer to help us finish up and get it out the door. I submitted my market information and business proposal to a university marketing research class, and they gathered data from a 50 person survey for us, which validated our ideas & assumptions. When we do launch it will be a quiet soft launch with friends & family trying it out first. Then we will tweak it with their feedback before we really try to make it public and do serious marketing efforts.<p>All of that said, our monetization strategy won&#x27;t be implemented until post-launch once we have this feedback from actual users and a good amount of them sticking around. The whole thing is bootstrapped and we haven&#x27;t spent anything, aside from the weekend development hours. Does this seem like the right approach for launching our product?",1382388989

Venture investments as an approach to maintaining their endowment does not, in any way, conflict with this -- all universities maintain investment portfolios.<p>Hennessy isn&#x27;t exactly a new comer to technology: when I was looking at errata for my Computer Architecture textbook (_the_ Computer Architecture textbook) I found it more surprising for me to find that one of its authors (Hennessy) was the president of Stanford (given that Patterson is at Berkeley and that STEM folks rarely took leadership positions at universities).<p>I did not attend Stanford myself, but plenty of my friends have, and I&#x27;ve been on campus many times. Like any institution, I am sure it has many valid criticisms -- the idea the educational system is purely meritocratic and available to anyone intelligent and motivated, for example, is still a myth (in several senses of the word -- it representations genuine aspiration, but does not reflect reality).<p>However, it isn&#x27;t some kind of a incubator for a lilly-white privileged elite that it&#x27;s made out to be: it&#x27;s incredibly diverse and beyond being a top-tier research university, it also has a great humanities program including a core curriculum. Indeed, the endowment is why students who do not come from wealthy backgrounds have been able to afford it (the same is also true for many other elite universities).<p>A long time ago, a friend who was heavily into hip-hop culture and lived in New York asked me if &quot;people were just being shot randomly&quot; in California, as the rap music seems to suggest. The idea that everyone in Silicon Valley is a startup founder is equally as silly: I remember the weekend after I left Yahoo (by then perceived to be in decline) to join a startup in January of 2008 (the nexus of web 2.0 boom), more people asked &quot;why are you leaving a known company to join some tiny one that may not be around&quot; then asked &quot;what took you so long?&quot;",1382388305

I agree that within the circle of safety you can readjust your position however you want, given enough time for you to readjust.<p>What I don&#x27;t necessarily see, is that one straight line is the best way to maximize the escape. For example, I could consider going at pi/2 for a bit, having the monster trying to catch up counter clock wise, and then slightly bend toward pi/2 + alpha.<p>This may be wrong, and maybe it&#x27;s easy to see, but I failed at understanding whether or not that is possible from the explanation. After all, it&#x27;s a similar strategy to the pi/2 one. I.e., the monster will have to get there covering more space. This would be very different from aiming at that point when you are at the edge of the safety circle, since now the monster is at a different relative position. So it depends on whether or not there is no solution that gives you some extra time.<p>For example, why is a spiral (that keeps being a spiral after leaving the safety circle) worse than a J shape? (same point as above but with a curve instead of two straight lines at an angle).<p>Another point is the optimal strategy for the monster. If the monster waits for a second waiting for you to move, would pi/2 still be the best strategy?<p>To be honest I think that the solution sounds perfectly reasonable.

By the same token, loops aren&#x27;t really of much use in functional languages, if they&#x27;re supported at all, unless the language also supports destructive update (and therefore has imperative features). One can debate the merits of imperative vs. functional programming, but there&#x27;s no reason to avoid for-loops as a natural expression within the imperative paradigm.<p>One thing I like about python loops, which CoffeeScript and Ruby, and apparently Nimrod, have adopted as well, is that they make you iterate over a data structure, rather than the C-style of providing start, finish, and step. Iterating over a data structure provides a better guarantee that the loop will terminate without errors (whereas, in Java for example, you could fall off the end of a linked list or an array if you&#x27;re not careful about your ending test or update step). This ends up being conceptually similar to a map, which is how Ruby&#x27;s each method works anyway.",1382387191

This most certainly extends to non-family members if a conflict of interest exists. It would be unethical if you prescribed medication to your bookie.<p>Anyway, my point stands regardless. The fact that there may be no strict illegality in a school or faculty investing in student project, does not mean there are no ethical issues that have to be resolved. Furthermore, the faculty or school may be opening itself up to liability. Frequently these kinds of issues are not judged (in civil court at least) strictly on their legality but rather on the &#x27;smell test&#x27;. I can imagine a scenario in which a student may sue the school alleging some negative repercussions in his school life given that the investment fell through (maybe sue the school for tuition fees he paid prior to being &#x27;pressured&#x27; to quit school).

And it&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s capable of realizing as much in the first place.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;common sense,&quot; per se. It&#x27;s more like uncommon sense. Most people follow an effort in -> result out paradigm, believing the two are perfectly correlated. A &quot;smart&quot; person, in PG&#x27;s view, attempts to min effort and max result. (I&#x27;ve also heard this sort of hacker described as &quot;lazy,&quot; in a positive and non-derogatory sense. A &quot;lazy&quot; person finds the most efficient and effective ways to do things, minimizing man-hours and resources.)<p>The relationship between &quot;smart&quot;/&quot;lazy&quot; and IQ hasn&#x27;t been studied all that well, but it seems plausible that there is <i>some</i> sort of relationship. Perhaps it&#x27;s a strong one, and perhaps it&#x27;s not. Either way, I don&#x27;t believe an IQ test as a single-factor qualification gate will filter effectively for &quot;smart&quot;/&quot;lazy.&quot;",1382386757

6587889,comment,6580627,6580627,2,0,icu,,,"Thanks MIT_Hacker for the article.<p>I&#x27;d like to extend your ideas a little and make the point that:<p>1) When you combine the two extremes of programmers you can get more than just harmony, you can gain synergy, and<p>2) As &quot;new-found learner&quot; I believe that the idea of &#x27;good programming&#x27; can be abstracted to be &#x27;good creative problem solving and communication.&#x27;<p>About the first point:<p>As I said I fall in the &quot;new-found learner&quot; category, for my start-up I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to have a &#x27;veteran&#x27; developer on my team who is astounding.  Every time I watch him code or he explains the architecture I learn something new and useful.  Best of all, we have a high synchronization ratio.<p>However even though he&#x27;s been working for nearly 10 years as a developer for some of the best financial institutions in the world it&#x27;s clear that he doesn&#x27;t have the entrepreneurial thought patterns necessary to gestate and birth a start-up.  The other day we were talking about this very thing and he&#x27;s said that he&#x27;s tried, and with others just like him, to dream up the next big &quot;Facebook&quot; opportunity, yet inspiration keeps eluding him.  He told me a &#x27;cautionary tale&#x27; about a colleague who quit his job to start-up a Golf Scorecard mobile app which got funding and then later tanked.  From what he said to me it seemed that this newbie entrepreneur had no intimate knowledge of the the customer&#x27;s needs, too much customer inertia and not enough market pull.  I would be so bold as to say it over engineered the problem.  These issues seemed obvious to me, but only through the lens of my own entrepreneurial experience... gained the hard way.<p>The point is that the &quot;new-found learner&quot; probably comes from a place where their life experiences add a &#x27;je ne sais quoi&#x27; to the mix when combined with the technical experience of your &quot;5th grade coders&quot;.  This makes for synergy.<p>About the second point:<p>I&#x27;m absolutely certain that the time I spent as a finance and economics consultant has been applicable to my approach to programming.  Why?  Well I was lucky enough to be taught how to logically &#x27;think&#x27; my way to an optimal client solution and how to communicate the solution in the clearest possible way.  I would roughly call it the &quot;McKinsey&#x27;s Approach To Problem-Solving.&quot;  When I say that I mean approaches like &#x27;understanding the question&#x27;, &#x27;hypothesis driven solutions&#x27;, &#x27;issue trees&#x27;, &#x27;mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE)&#x27;, and the &#x27;80/20 solution search.&#x27;  Looking back I&#x27;m certain that what set the consultancy I worked for and the others was the ability to communicate the solutions.  Often economic or financial questions have complex answers.  Even if the answer is simple it is often put forward in a complex way.  By taking complex ideas and putting them forward in an simple way, and keeping simple ideas simple, the consultancy was extremely effective and profitable.  The secret to this effective communication was our Plain English approach to writing.  The CEO of the consultancy was fanatical about it, even to the point of reviewing as many client reports before they were delivered.<p>I find that by adapting these problem solving &#x27;thinking patterns&#x27; to my programming, while keeping in mind that I need to communicate clearly I&#x27;m at least productive enough to keep up with the &quot;5th grade coder&quot; in my team.",1382386497

If you have a Java code writing C code writing web pages [1], you&#x27;ll get progressively larger number of lines of code depending on where you take the count.<p>Another way could be needless, but legally mandated, duplication.

I just gave a different approach to the issue. My mind is not made up on this subject. I've been a programmer for too long: 0 is burned in my fingers and my mind.<p><i>> a machine instruction would operate on indexes, not ordinals</i><p>The interesting aspect isn't the difference between indexes and ordinals, but the difference between indexes and cardinals. The cardinals match the ordinals for normal people. For normal people, indexes have no meaning.<p>But the difference between indexes and cardinals aren't that easy for programmers either. In an example presented by Dijkstra a young programmer used 0 in everyday language as a cardinal replacing 1. Indexes have little meaning in real life, but cardinals do.<p>Good response, BTW. Thanks. It's interesting to link the concepts of ordinals and cardinals to the discussion.",1250870355

Everyone was required to follow the code - from the designers building ads to the salespeople cold-calling universities.<p>It was simple work, and I yearned to be promoted to the actual development group - they got to work in PHP and C++, while I was stuck with plain old HTML, CSS, and a smattering of JavaScript. Until I found out what kind of code was responsible for a majority of the company's revenue. One of their salespeople had apparently picked up a PHP book quite a while ago, and suggested to management that they move away from cardpacks and start generating leads online. He was crafty, and made them sign a document saying the code was owned solely by him. He wrote the software that drove the lead generation platform, and a few months later quit. They hired him back at twice the salary to come in once a week as a consultant to fix bugs.<p>And bugs a plenty there were. Of course, the three developers in the next pod weren't allowed to touch the Holy Grail of Lead Generation. It was owned by the contractor. There were severe, showstopping bugs cropping up nearly weekly while I was there - bugs that would cause clients to drop us. And that was once I came on board - they'd been using the same PHP file for the previous 7 years or so. And the contractor would always tell us that it was our (the designers) fault for corrupted lead data.<p>One of the developers in the next pod found a security hole in the server one day, and grabbed a copy of the php file. All 14,000 lines of nested if blocks that it was. Every ""bug fix"" was simply a switch at the bottom of the file, with one case for each of the accounts that ended up having bugs.<p>Every time we suggested ways of making the process of getting a campaign out the door faster and more efficient, management would tell us: ""OK, if you want it done - come in on the weekend."" The CTO couldn't understand what an API was.<p>I haven't worked at a place that required a tie for any of the employees since then. When it comes to small businesses, at least - from this experience and several of my acquaintances' - if there's a dress code, run very, very far away. It's usually an indicator that you're expected to be a cog in the machine - not a curator of the machine.<p>(The direct marketing firm was bought out by a competitor about three months after I left, who had even worse lead generation software.

Simply put, if you start numbering at 1, you are setting yourself up for more boundary problems and off-by-one errors than if you start at 0 (and by extension, inclusive lower bounds and exclusive upper bounds). That's not to say that some algorithms are not in fact easier expressed by numbering things from 1, just that they're not the majority.<p>Oh, and obviously 0 is even. Why? Because 0 mod 2 = 0, 0 is evenly divided by 2, and that's what ""even"" means. If you need more intuition, though: 1 is indisputably odd, and even and odd numbers alternate, so 0 is even. The rest is philosophy -- you can probably find definitions for ""odd"" and ""even"" where 0 is a problem. That's fine, but those don't help. Ignore them. Mathematically there's no problem whatsoever.<p>The trickiness only comes if you insist in thinking in terms of ""the first element"", rather than ""element number 0"". Some people use ""zeroth"", but this seems to invite more confusion because it induces two meanings for all the other ordinal forms -- if there's a zeroth element, does that mean the ""first"" element is in fact the second element?

I came from Los Alamos and in the early days I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good service as other people. So I set out to measure. You came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not getting a fair deal. I said to myself, ``Why? No Vice President at IBM said, `Give Hamming a bad time'. It is the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in, but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I haven't mistreated them.'' Answer, I wasn't dressing the way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came down to just that - I wasn't dressing properly. I had to make the decision - was I going to assert my ego and dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my effort from my professional life, or was I going to appear to conform better? I decided I would make an effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did, I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful character, I get better service than other people.<p>You should dress according to the expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady price.",1250867214

As I have heard it used, ""artsy-fartsy"" means ""self-consciously exhibiting the accoutrements and mannerisms of artists (or art lovers) in order to enjoy the respect accorded to artists (or art lovers), without producing anything of merit or interest (or having any taste).""  It also has a faint connotation of being a step behind society, imitating the stuffy pretensions of the last (and now hopelessly conservative) generation of critics, which makes it feel <i>slightly</i> imperfect for this context, but only slightly.<p>If one artist called another artist ""artsy fartsy,"" it would mean about the same thing as ""poseur.""  But usually it's applied by a non-artist to someone who has artistic pretensions:  ""Why are you being such a arrogant ass when you have done nothing to justify it?""  People tolerate all kinds of pathological behavior from great artists, and they resent it when a crappy or mediocre artist tries to take the same liberties.",1250867093

You dress to a minimal standard to show respect for others, and to communicate ""seriousness"". Sometimes, you have to spell the standard out out. I have worked with people who wear torn or worn out t-shirts and similarly worn out shorts. It turns off some potential employees and customers who catch a glimpse of them - fair or not.<p>Sure, it's a little silly to insist on suits for someone crawling on the floor (I still remember in incident with a skirt, an awkward cable, and a customer tour coming in at the wrong moment).

However, it&#x27;s also important to acknowledge that there is enormous variation in the freedom of the media to operate across countries. There are highly repressive media domains where a single actor represses others and achieves a near monopoly. Could the US improve freedom of expression domestically? Yes. Do we systematically repress dissenters as is common Russia, Bangladesh, etc? No",1447091962

10534542,comment,10534394,10534394,0,0,smt88,,,"1. None of your decisions are important. I&#x27;m not saying that to belittle you. I&#x27;m saying it because you can worry yourself sick if you&#x27;re afraid of doing the wrong thing. Life is a balance between &quot;analysis paralysis&quot; and jumping into things too quickly.<p>You should lean toward jumping too quickly. Even if you make some small mistakes, be open-minded and willing to learn from them, and you&#x27;ll be able to recover.<p>It takes many years of compounding a mistake before you&#x27;re unable to recover. Career-wise, it probably can&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;re 45+ (due to age discrimination).<p>2. Whenever possible, take your career in a direction that allows you to be paid more for working fewer hours. This will pay off later in life when you have the money to travel or just want to see loved ones.<p>There are many ways to accomplish this. One of them is to ask for better-sounding titles, even if they don&#x27;t come with more responsibility or pay. Another is to develop skills that are widely applicable, rather than highly specific. The worst thing you can do is to develop skills that are only applicable to your specific employer.<p>For example, I have a lawyer friend who worked on a lawsuit related to microprocessors. He did this for five years. When he wanted to move to a different firm, no one wanted to hire him because he only had experience with microprocessor litigation.<p>If you&#x27;re starting out as a developer, try to work somewhere that uses modern, popular technology. Both of those are important: modern and popular. For example, a company that exclusively uses Haskell or Scala is probably not a great idea. You&#x27;d want to get experience at something like Python, C++, C#, Java, or JavaScript instead. (Note that the culture of companies that use Java extensively are often very poor, so make sure to read Glassdoor reviews or ask HN about the company).<p>3. Sleep. If you focus on doing one thing at a time, you&#x27;ll be way more efficient than your peers, and you&#x27;ll have time to sleep 8+ hours a night. Don&#x27;t work at a company that expects you to sleep less than 6 hours a night and spend all your time at the office. They&#x27;re living in the past and don&#x27;t understand that overall output suffers when people don&#x27;t get to rest.<p>4. Build and use your social network. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask friends, parents&#x27; friends, relatives, and strangers to help you. If you don&#x27;t have many friends, go out of your way to make more.<p>My life is exponentially better because of only 2 friendships that I randomly made a few years ago. It&#x27;s been literally like winning the lottery. But you have to meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends before you find those relationships.<p>5. Your career isn&#x27;t and shouldn&#x27;t be your life. If you can&#x27;t have an interesting conversation with someone that doesn&#x27;t mention your job, you&#x27;re doing something wrong. Have hobbies and other interests.<p>In that same vein, ask yourself (or old people) what someone might regret toward the end of their lives. Absolutely no one will say &quot;I wish I&#x27;d spent more time working&quot;. Virtually all of them will say &quot;I wish I&#x27;d spent more time with my family/friends/pets/hobbies&quot;. If you don&#x27;t believe me, go out and ask.<p>6. Leave your comfort zone whenever possible. The more you practice it, the better you&#x27;ll get at it. Every amazing thing in life requires being vulnerable and leaving your comfort zone.",1447091659

Bringing down does not mean putting them out of business -- that&#x27;s rather incidental -- it means creating fear and terror amongst a large part of the users to convince them that the majority of the internet is against them -- the internet is not the place for them. It is not just threatening women or minorities, obviously -- it could also be pretending to be an extremist feminist, and suggesting men should be hanged, burned etc, provoking the other group, and causing conflicts.<p>Obviously there are numerous examples of groups of that sort of size which, whilst unpaid, have been extremely zealous in their attempts to &quot;bring down&quot; Reddit. It&#x27;s questionable how successful they&#x27;ve been. There&#x27;s been a singular failure to convert the masses into believing that &quot;ethics in game journalism&quot; is a pressing issue.

(The presence of such a power indicates that their is a definable market in which that seller is the only seller, and its absence indicates that in the markets in which the good is relevant there are acceptable substitutes which compete on price.)<p>So, it is probably defensible to claim that land is <i>prone to</i> monopolies, but inaccurate to say that land <i>is</i> a monopoly.",1447091553

What I cared about is that it combines elements of some of my favorite strategy games into a single medium.  I often say that it has elements of chess, poker and reaction based games like first person shooters.<p>It is like chess in that it is a game of strategy and board control, army movement, identifying what your opponent is planning and actively countering it, identifying weaknesses and exploiting them.<p>It is like poker in that is a game of imperfect information.  Unlike chess I cannot ever see the entire board in starcraft, only the pieces I have scouted and as soon as my scout leaves that information is now outdated and assumptions have to be made about the actions of the opponent since I last had accurate information.  Poker is similar in that you can never have 100% certainty of what your opponent may be holding, there is always that knowledge gap and great players can exploit it.<p>It is like first person shooters in that is it reaction based, the person who is able to more efficiently process the information they are receiving and make correct decisions about their course of action can execute faster and have an exponential return in terms of tipping the scales in their favor.  This applies to many things such as base building, army building and micro mechanics during army engagement.<p>I&#x27;ve been a fan for so long precicely because these fine strategy details and forced decision making make an excellent filter between the good and the great, the great and the elite.  Watching the elite play is comparable in my mind to watching chess grandmasters battle only in real time and not turn based where their perceived life is on the line and one slip up can cause instant death.  It&#x27;s that great adrenaline high, not the background story, that has kept me so engaged for so long.",1447090972

People feel like they need to get a leg up on each other in order to retain jobs and be promoted within jobs, so they make themselves available for work purposes when they are not being paid. Effectively, people compensate for the wriggling anxiety of an &quot;unfulfilled&quot; work obligation (an unanswered email received after hours) by giving away their labor for free (answering the email despite not being paid during that time period to do so). I think this is also why people may claim that they enjoy or don&#x27;t mind answering work emails after work; the reduction of anxiety after tying up an email provides a tangible upward delta for emotion. I am of the opinion that 99% of after-work emails would be eliminated if employers had to pay for the hour-block during which employees are answering emails.<p>&quot;But when asked what aspects have the most negative impact on work-life balance, work emails ranked rather low at 18 percent—topping the list were bad bosses, working after hours, and employers being inflexible about vacation.&quot;<p>Ah, the article is pretending that answering emails after hours isn&#x27;t working after hours. They&#x27;re the same thing, because thought and communication about details of work equals work. Bad bosses will tend to email after hours as well. Employers not respecting the majority of their employee&#x27;s time (which is spent outside of work) is also closely related to being &quot;inflexible&quot; (not respecting the contract) about vacation.

Behind the former (&quot;Anti-China trolls&quot;, that is) at the moment we have just one specific example brought to our attention. Behind the later (&quot;Russian trolls&quot;) is anything anybody understands as such. It appears that the journalist who wrote the article we discuss here considers every author of some pro-Russian opinion as a troll (according to the article kaitai linked to <a href=""http://kioski.yle.fi/omat/this-is-what-pro-russia-internet-propaganda-feels-like"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kioski.yle.fi/omat/this-is-what-pro-russia-internet-p...</a> ). So there you have a lot of ordinary people who could actually be Russians living in Finland. Or if we extend that to other languages, we also get the people who aren&#x27;t necessary native speakers.<p>Then we have the people supposedly working at some &quot;government site which pays people to write comments&quot; (as linked by zorf, <a href=""http://kioski.yle.fi/omat/at-the-origins-of-russian-propaganda"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kioski.yle.fi/omat/at-the-origins-of-russian-propagan...</a> ) being paid some 600 EUR a month, who again are almost certainly not the native speakers and probably aren&#x27;t motivated too much to care (&quot;we&#x27;ll lower your salary because you screwed up the grammar on some of your posts&quot;).<p>So we can&#x27;t expect grammar(Russian trolls) to have a high value, and the grammar(Anti-China trolls) is based on a very small sample. That &quot;proves&quot; the current state of the given inequality.<p>I also hope that this &quot;derivation&quot; also illustrates that naming names (&quot;Anti-China trolls&quot; &quot;Russian trolls&quot;) is actually a wrong approach to learn anything about anything.

Start deploying your cable. Once it gets long enough, say a few kilometres long, tides hold it rigidly pointing towards Earth. You solve the counterweight problem by also extending a cable <i>outwards</i> from your launch vehicle, so keeping the centre of gravity still. Eventually the bottom of the cable reaches ground level and you&#x27;re done. On the plus side, you now also have a 36,000km long cable extending past geostationary orbit, ideal for interplanetary launches.<p>> What would we do if several kilometers of ultra-strong cable fell down into the earth?<p>Not much. If the point at which it&#x27;s severed is low, the lower part will just fall down and you pick it up and weld it back on. If it&#x27;s a bit higher, the lower part falls down and burns it.

Public Citizen has another, <a href=""http://www.citizen.org/documents/fast-track-chart.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citizen.org/documents/fast-track-chart.pdf</a><p><i>&quot;When Richard Nixon was president, he cooked up Fast Track to seize power from Congress. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to “regulate commerce with foreign nations” (Art. I-8). Fast Track was a mechanism that delegated away to the executive branch Congress’ authority to control the contents of U.S. trade pacts, as well as other important powers.<p>Fast Track empowered executive branch trade negotiators, advised by more than 600 official trade advisors who mostly represent large corporations, to choose trade partners and negotiate and sign trade pacts, all before Congress voted. Once signed, Fast Track put such deals on a legislative luge run: no matter how many domestic non-trade policies were implicated or threatened by the deal, Fast Tracked agreements hurtled through Congress within a set number of days, with normal democratic checks and balances iced over.<p>Fast Track ensured that Congress’ role came too late to influence trade pacts’ contents: Congress only got a yes or no vote after a pact was signed and “entered into.” That vote also OK’d hundreds of changes to U.S. non-trade law to conform our policies to “trade” deal terms. Federalism was also flattened by Fast Track via a form of international pre-emption: state officials had to conform local laws to expansive non-trade domestic policy restrictions in Fast Tracked “trade” pacts. State officials did not even get Congress’ cursory role.<p>… Fast Track should be relegated to a museum of inappropriate technology. Congress, state officials and the public need a new modern procedure for developing U.S. trade policy, one that takes into account the realities of 21st-century globalization agreements.&quot;</i>",1447090011

I took a finance class at a top business school, and it&#x27;s nothing compared to Engineering. A bit of time-value-of-money and maybe some option math, but really it doesn&#x27;t come close to the sophistication of a CS or Engineering course. I went to a meeting last week with a guy who wanted an automated trading system. He hadn&#x27;t heard of Python. He didn&#x27;t have any idea how to execute other than on 3rd party programs (which of course use algos, but he was just providing the decisions).<p>- Lack of scale. There&#x27;s a lot of family offices who have a few tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. If they wanted an algo trading guy, they&#x27;d have to pay him a lot of money, you&#x27;d want more than one, and you&#x27;d need infrastructure. Plus there&#x27;s the risk you get all this, hire the guys, and their results are no better than random. A lot of small fortunes like this tend to spend more time in tech-soft areas, like private equity or private debt. The stock trades are an afterthought that they can&#x27;t spend much resource on.<p>- Two kinds of decision making: arbitrage and investment. The put it bluntly, arbitrage is easy to mechanize. If some guy quotes some options at the wrong value, it&#x27;s obvious you want to trade with him. There&#x27;s looser arbs (things that sort of always come back to normal), but the principle is the same. In some sense, it&#x27;s not a financial challenge, it&#x27;s a technological one. For investment (I think XYZ corp will go up), you need to have a sense of what risk you want to take. Utility functions are not easy to put into code. You can try, but you end up with situations where you decide not to have the algo on. There&#x27;s also the principal-agent problem; most traders are agents, they need to look good to their boss. They need to be able to explain why they are betting on some company. Often, more effort goes into how to justify your trades than what trades to do.<p>- Things that can&#x27;t go into a machine: I worked with a guy who used to go meet the CEOs, look them in the eye, and ask them if they&#x27;d make money. Now I&#x27;m not saying this approach works, but if this is your investment edge, how are you ever going to put that in a machine?<p>- Insider information: taking this in the loose sense, not the criminal one. If you&#x27;re highly dependent on understanding some part of the market better than others, you may be better off talking and networking rather than coding. Goldmans are great at this. Every time you meet them, they offer a bit of info in exchange for yours. It lets them see things like the mortgage bubble before it happens, whereas a model would probably have issues due to the small amount of computerized data.",1447089843

How do you get the cable up there? You can&#x27;t just shoot up a rocket with a cable attached and expect the cable to stay upright: it would fall down unless you give it horizontal speed. But if you do that, you&#x27;d probably end up orbiting the Earth and tying it up with the cable.<p>The other option would be dropping the cable down, but you&#x27;d probably end up with a similar problem. I&#x27;m no physicist, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that dropping that amount of mass would shift the center of mass of the satellite-cable system and mess with the orbit.<p>Even if you manage to deploy the cable, you&#x27;d still have the problem of the counterweight. I&#x27;ve read that proposed solutions include a captured asteroid (we&#x27;ve just been able to land - or crash, depending on how you see it - in one), a space station/spaceport (that&#x27;s definitely not cheap), an extended cable (which probably would require even more complex materials) or junk from the construction (still the same problem).<p>And we still haven&#x27;t got to the point of security. How do you keep things (space junk, satellites, meteors) from hitting the cable? What would we do if several kilometers of ultra-strong cable fell down into the earth?<p>I think that space elevators are a nice fantasy, and just that.

10534265,comment,10525771,10525771,0,0,redmaverick,,,"I was born and brought up in India and have lived in the U.S for around 6+ years before finally returning back home recently.<p>Living outside your own country for a significant length time is pretty mind expanding. This is what I have realized:<p>Culture is a very real thing. A lot of the thoughts that we have are not really our own. They are a product of the culture around you. It is pretty incredible to observe.<p>This is just from my perspective.<p>America values rugged individualism while most asian countries including India, China, Japan, Philippines value the opposite.\nHere are some things I found pretty interesting.<p>America: Family<p>1. Your child doesn&#x27;t owe anything to you. No child asks to be born. You made the choice to have a baby and so it is your duty and responsibility to educate them well and provide basic comfort and security. It is your responsibility to meet your own emotional needs. American parents feel like they are failures if their kid continues to stay in their home after they reach adulthood. Even the adult children feel the same way. I remember Travis Kalanick mentioning the time he was living with his parents as pretty depressing (after his startup Redswoosh failed) If you want to insult someone here you can say, &quot;Are you still staying with your parents?. You need to move out of your parent&#x27;s basement!&quot;<p>Once the kids move out, the parents reconnect with each other and will try and pursue their own interests.<p>India<p>Your life is a gift from your parents who will be the number one priority in your life. You owe your parents everything. Indian parents will do <i>ANYTHING</i> and <i>everything</i> for their kids. They will sell their property and get into a lot of debt, if it comes to that, to educate their kids and to make sure they have a great life. Kids are expected to honor and listen to their parents. Even after marriage there is a tug of war between the mom/dad who feels that their kid is being stolen from them by the spouse. If you want to insult an Indian you can just say, &quot;He/she doesn&#x27;t respect elders&quot;. In India parents work hard so their kids can enjoy their money and property. People admire kids who stay and live with their parents. Even celebrities who are worth many millions of dollars stay together with their parents as a family and there is nothing disrespectful about it. The children are an extension of their selves and there is a deep life long attachment. The kids will take care of their parents in their old age. People get very offended if you ask them if their parents are living in an old age home/retirement/assisted facilities.<p>&quot;A marriage is considered to be a union between two families and not two people!&quot;, is a common dialogue heard everywhere in India. Most people say this as if it is the most obvious truth. It&#x27;s almost like saying the sky is blue. In the US, a marriage is considered a union between two individuals and not two families.<p>Again, here is the question. How come most Americans feel exactly the same way? How come most Indians feel the opposite?<p>2. The need to learn a foreign language.<p>Most Indians know three languages. 1. Their own native language (like, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gujarati etc) 2. Hindi 3. English. A lot of people know and understand upto 4 or even 5 languages. So, there is nothing special about knowing different languages. People won&#x27;t be impressed if you tell them you know French, Spanish or Mandarin. It&#x27;s like telling someone that you can hop on one leg for a few miles. A difficult but pointless achievement.<p>For many Americans, knowing a foreign language is a big deal. They will go to great lengths to learn Spanish, French or Mandarin. Mark Zuckerberg showed off his ability to speak Mandarin a while back. I read one answer in Quora (which an elderly person wrote) mentioning that he regrets not being able to learn a foreign language. Tim Ferris shows off his foreign language acquisition skills to impress visitors to his blog and tv shows.<p>Again I have to ask the same question: How come most people in the US feel this way? To an outsider it seems really silly and absurd.<p>3. &quot;4 people&quot;. In India, many people live for the sake of society. This is true everywhere. Most people want to impress others but it is at a completely different level in India. People make life changing decisions not based on their own interests but for the sake of society. There are 20+ plus languages in India and interestingly, almost every single language has this phrase &quot;4 people&quot;. Are you planning to quit your job at Google to do your own startup? What will the &quot;4 people&quot; around you think? What do you mean you are not getting married? What will the &quot;4 people&quot; say? Conformity is everything. If your older sibling or younger sibling marries someone from a different race/caste/religion then it means that your family doesn&#x27;t have a value system and it will be difficult for you to find a spouse because you come from a family with no values.<p>4. Inquisitiveness. Indian people are very inquisitive. If you are overweight, they will advise you to start dieting. &quot;Looks like you&#x27;ve been eating a lot. You need to lose weight&quot;, is a common refrain. They will ask you how much something costs, how much money you make per year and enquire about your properties and other assets. If you tell them you booked a flight from L.A to Delhi, the first question they will ask is about the flight cost. If you are their friend they will quiz you about your savings. Again, this is not just one person or two but most people in India.<p>Again, the same question, why do most people born in a certain culture all behave in a certain way? It&#x27;s almost like people are hypnotized en-masse into believing some things as fundamental truths. Pretty surreal to experience it.",1447089331

10534183,comment,10533922,10533922,0,0,leroy_masochist,,,"Former investment banker here. This is a question I had when I hit the desk, and it&#x27;s an important question.<p>The short answer to your question is: because most of the volume traded on exchanges is large blocks of stock being bought and sold by institutional investors, and you need humans to make these deals happen.<p>Longer explanation as follows:<p>On the trading floor [0], you have two groups of people: the sales team and the traders.<p>The sales team gets paid when they make markets, i.e., connect buyers and sellers. Specifically, the financial institution takes a fee that&#x27;s a very small % of the overall transaction volume, and some of that goes into the sales team&#x27;s bonus pool. The more stock trades flow through the firm (specifically, their business unit), the more they get paid.<p>The traders, on the other hand, gets paid to do two things, which are really the same thing: a) not put too much of the firm&#x27;s capital at risk and b) set the firm up to make money by buying securities low and selling them high. Every trader has a &quot;P&L&quot; (profit & loss) number, which is the total amount of money they&#x27;ve made or lost for the firm since the start of the fiscal year. They get paid a bonus based on this number. They tend to know exactly what their number is at any given time.<p>So, there is actually a lot of tension on the trading floor between the sales team and the traders, because the sales team wants a lot of volume to go through their business unit, and any given trader wants to maximize her P&L.<p>Real world example might be: the sales dude gets a call from a hedge fund saying, &quot;we want to sell $100mm of our shares in Alphabet at $720&quot;. He then shouts over to the trader (who sits close to him) to tell her about the call and she thinks for a couple seconds [1] and then says, &quot;you need to make a market for 80mm of those shares at that price, I&#x27;m only taking 20mm.&quot;<p>In other words, the trader is saying that she&#x27;ll only tie up $20mm of the firm&#x27;s capital on this particular trade [2]. The sales person might come back and say, &quot;c&#x27;mon, they took that $50mm of Microsoft stock you were trying to get rid of last quarter, we as a firm owe them a favor&quot; to which the trader might respond, &quot;OK, we&#x27;ll take $30mm tops&quot;. So then the sales person will get on the phone and start calling everyone (other mutual / hedge funds, pension funds, etc) who might be interested in buying Alphabet at $720. Maybe the sales person makes it happen; maybe they don&#x27;t. In any case, they need to figure out whether they can get 70 million dollars worth Alphabet stock pre-sold to other people in the market at $720 before they get back to the hedge fund trying to sell it with a response as to whether they can make the trade.<p>All of this involves MASSIVE HUMAN FACTORS. I&#x27;m sure we will one day be able to train AI to work through various constructs of &quot;we owe them a favor&quot; but right now you still need humans to get big trades like this done. And again, big trades like this constitute the majority of the overall volume in the market. So, that&#x27;s why trades don&#x27;t run entirely on algorithms...yet.<p>[0] I was in banking, not S&T, but have a decent understanding of how this works.<p>[1] Being able to make decisions of this magnitude in a couple of seconds (and have them be good ones) is one of the two skills you need to have as a trader; the other one is not letting the outcome of the last trade (good or bad) affect your thinking on the next trade.<p>[2] There is potential for both upside and downside in a decision like this; if the stock appreciates, the firm can profit by selling the stock at a higher price than it paid, but the reverse is also true. This is also an example of why &quot;proprietary trading&quot; is such a blurry line. In order to make markets for big trades, firms usually have to put their own capital at risk, even for a few minutes. At what point are they trading for their own profit vs. temporarily assuming risk in order to broker a deal between two counterparties? Go read Matt Levine&#x27;s archived columns at Bloomberg if you find stuff like this interesting.",1447088653

When it&#x27;s time to leave, book a ZipCar for one hour. Grab its parking pass and use it to exit the garage with your car.

Don&#x27;t allow an exit without a corresponding entrance? Sucks for the next person to use the ZipCar. But how will they know it was you? Are video archives good enough to find the plate associated with a particular card swipe without a ton of manual effort?<p>(Assume you&#x27;re trying to store a car for a month or more.

There was literally not enough food, due to very poor agricultural practices and very inefficient industry. Per Yegor Gaidar (who later became Russia&#x27;s Prime Minister) there was barely enough food to feed the population of Moscow during the winter of 1985-85. This is what made the Soviet leadership of the time suggest some changes, before hunger really struck the country.<p>Actually, there were a few more or less efficient industries in the USSR: it produced quite nice automatic weapons, military aircraft and pretty reliable spacecraft. These things required efficiency (at least, in a form of a well-working end result) due to high visibility and apparent military importance. The regime could not afford to be weak on the military side, or look like a failure in space. It could ration butter, milk, sausage, etc to the population because it was not such a big deal, apparently.",1447088428

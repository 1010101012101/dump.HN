While I definitely agree, there is a steep learning curve for getting Kubernetes set up and configured, there are several factually inaccurate things in this article.<p>> With Docker we were supposed not to have installation instructions (aside from a few docker run arguments). We were supposed to run containers. Swarm fulfils that promise and Kubernetes doesn’t.<p>We run Kubernetes on CoreOS and every piece runs in a container. On the master, the api-server, controller and scheduler all run in docker containers. On the minions, the proxy and kubelet both run in containers.<p>> Another thing I dislike about Kubernetes is its need to know things in advance, before the setup. You need to tell it the addresses of all your nodes, which role each of them has, how many minions there are in the cluster and so on.<p>The master does not need to know the these things. Minions do need to know the address of the master, but they can self-register with master and join the cluster anytime.<p>With that being said, it did take two of our senior devs over a week to get a cluster we were happy with.

The dramatic photography of the magazine is only coming across in about 50% of the photos and the headlines are all clickbait format.<p>2. Their television presence includes shows like &quot;Drugs, Inc.&quot; whose primarily job is to scare old people with re-enactments of drug crimes.  Who would pay for that &quot;value&quot;?

And so on.<p>It just looks similar in the surface, but when one used such a system it is quite poor.<p>My experience boils down to Oberon, which was Niklaus Wirth version of Mesa/Cedar.<p>Smaltalk Works, which allowed me to have a glipse of the original Smalltalk.<p>The way Powershell, .NET, COM and DLLs work together on Windows (even though it is still lacking).<p>My own research into Xerox PARC systems, as I keep hunting those papers.<p>So with all of this, what do I mean by only being similar on the surface?<p>Yes, UNIX CLI experience provides a way to work interactively, pipe data between programs, have them communicate between them (if one makes use of IPC) and a few other things.<p>Note that not all UNIX have something like /proc.<p>However it is all text based, even the UI.<p>The Xerox PARC systems were graphical, the REPL was graphical and could use inline data, think IPython/Playgrounds.<p>The OS and the REPL being the same language meant that the whole OS was available in the REPL. Since one was running as root on those workstations, you could literal control everything from the REPL.<p>Like find window X, select text, convert to bold, for example.<p>Having the same language also meant accessing any OS library was just an import away, no extra steps required.<p>Imagine having a graphical CLI, where you can write e.g. soname.func(a, b) without extra effort and doing FP data manipulation.<p>Actually there is a Xerox PARC paper where they research UNIX as dynamic programming environment.<p><a href=""https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_xeroxparctXNeedsATrueIntegratedEnvironment_1363391"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_xeroxparctXNeedsATrueI...</a>",1446648584

Then when the National Labor Relations Board &quot;interpreted&quot; the law 27 years later to include it as a benefit that was inclusive of employment did it become a larger liability. Large companies were able to absorb the costs of pensions being paid into the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [2] after the 1974 setting of requirements, hurting the ability of small companies to set up comparable benefits. The slow death march of private based pensions follows the incentive curve and the movement to defined contribution for companies enables smaller companies to be more competitive with the big companies [3].<p>* The medical coverage one vexes me financially, as I do not know how guaranteed this is, of all the things that would be eliminated in a bankruptcy, this is most probable and would save the receiving company a lot of money.<p>My point here is that the 401k and retirement program free of the company means you create an employee who has more worries about retirement, but is not locked into an employer&#x27;s retirement pension contribution system.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ebri.org/publications/facts/index.cfm?fa=0398afact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ebri.org/publications/facts/index.cfm?fa=0398afac...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corpo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://20somethingfinance.com/defined-benefit-vs-defined-contribution-retirement-plans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://20somethingfinance.com/defined-benefit-vs-defined-con...</a>",1446648186

How difficult is it for a blind man to fill out a paper form?<p>With a Web form, users can check themselves whether or not rooms are available. The form can determine if there are errors before it is submitted so no further communication needs to be made. It can be built in an accessible manner so that the blind can use it.

Encryption can be added to the process, no paper or ink is used (reducing the cost of the transaction on both ends), and no landline (or access to a landline) is required on the user&#x27;s end.<p>Even a very simple form submission system that does nothing but replicate the fax machine form would still be better than the fax just due to the ability to encrypt the communication and accessibility issues.",1446648034

If this propagates across EU / US / other countries it will bring an end to many cloud-based services & many saving governments & commercial are planning or envisioning for the next years. Wild guess estimate in damages to the UK (five years) - £100Billion + long term effects.<p>It seems the group of people pushing on this piece of legislation so heavily since years have not learned a bit from what is / has been happening in the UK and elsewhere for many years across industries (alternative reality: they want to create an very large income stream for themselves. This will nevertheless be most likely be short-lived at the cost of the overall UK economy / competitiveness - short- & long-term).<p>What has been proven over-and-over again in the UK (and certainly elsewhere as well) is that government or similar oversight is not working and is constantly abused by those given access to these means when large financial amounts / incentives are available to those who &quot;bend&quot; these processes / regulations / e.a. to their own benefit. At the same time those so far do not have to fear any reprisal / punishment. This is another shortcoming and clearly demonstrates that the true intentions of this legislation must be completely different from the labeling publicly provided - I&#x27;m talking about punishment along the line given to so called &quot;hackers&quot; in the UK / US - 10 years min. - but wait - it was the UK just recently that has removed all punishment for breaking the law 100&#x27;000s of times by some of its services (they couldn&#x27;t make it legal without due process through the parliament so they just removed the punishment).<p>Let&#x27;s have a brief look into how well &quot;oversight&quot; works in the UK:<p>- News of the World (data / access sold off by government employees)<p>- UK Mis-selling saga with PPI - unique case as almost £30Billion in compensations have been granted - non-working financial oversight<p>- Gold fixing scandal - non-working financial oversight for many years / decade<p>- FX fixing scandal - non-working financial oversight for many years / decade<p>- Bailouts / 2008 financial crisis - non-working financial oversight for many years<p>- NHS data leaks - no due process and proper data protection<p>- plenty more to add ...<p>... crime and abuse of the rules happens when an opportunity is provided with incentives and no reprisal.<p>IMHO - that is the biggest danger from all these almost limitless surveillance laws and powers provided without checks.",1446647751

My family had a couple computers before, but the first computer that was really mine was a Gateway 2000 486/33. I think I got it around 1991 or 1992. The first and only time I&#x27;ve ever bought MS Windows in a retail box was Windows 3.0 for an older 386sx/16... The Gateway was the first of a continual sequence of machines that shipped with a Windows license built in.<p>For the time, the machine was relatively sophisticated. It had 8MB of memory and an ATI Mach 8 based graphics accelerator that was basically a single board combination of an 8514/A clone and a VGA Wonder. It drove the upgrade 15&quot; monitor fairly well at 1024x768x8bpp. Over the life of the machine, I added a 400MB disk, a CD-ROM, a 17&quot; monitor and converted it over to Linux 0.9something. It made a fairly reasonable low-end Linux workstation for a kid studying computer science.<p>Where the machine started to age was in memory capacity and bus bandwidth. Our machine was bought just before VLB became common, so all I/O had to be done over a 1984-era 8MHz 16-bit bus. This particularly killed video performance for anything beyond 8bpp. The 8MB of RAM was also pretty thin by the time Linux was running with X and Emacs. Emacs got the nickname &#x27;Eight Megabytes And Constantly Swapping&#x27; for a good reason, as far as I could tell. Neither of those issues could be addressed without effectively replacing the entire machine, so I wound up replacing it with a later Micron P5-100. Either way, the Gateway was a great machine and very formative for me. RIP, Mr. Hammond.",1446647726

There is an authoritative rejection of the patch itself at the end, but still the revised post sounds like Linus is inviting people to post their opinions over whether the code is actually problematic or not.  By contrast, the original post makes it clear that he is <i>highly</i> convinced that the code is bad and will need extremely persuasive evidence to change his mind.  Now, you could say that it&#x27;s rarely productive to solve problems by shutting down debate, and that he <i>should</i> invite opinions - but in truth, Linus probably would at least consider a sufficiently rigorous and detailed counterargument, and him clearly expressing the force of his opinion gives other people a signal that they should take the time to write such an argument, rather than being more brief (because they think Linus is hesitant and that that is sufficient), and then being promptly overruled, even if, given the chance, they could have persuaded him.<p>You might not see Eisenburg&#x27;s version as hesitant yourself, but that&#x27;s precisely the point - all language is ambiguous, but using reserved language errs on the side of having people think your opinion weaker than it is, while harsh language is the opposite.<p>Of course, the flipside is that someone who doesn&#x27;t know Linus&#x27;s history might well conclude that he&#x27;s so angry as to be beyond reason, discouraging detailed rebuttals for the opposite reason.  In fact, I think that is <i>likely</i> to happen in this case, and that therefore his post went too far - just because I am defending harsh language in general doesn&#x27;t mean I agree exactly with his tone choices.  There are certainly potential midpoints between the actual rant and Eisenburg&#x27;s version that would clearly establish his position without being quite so mean.  But hindsight is 20/20, and the problems with Eisenburg&#x27;s version show the danger in general of being reserved in online text communication, given its low bandwidth.<p>- The rant also makes it clear that he thinks the whole idea of using such functions is bad, and that other authors writing somewhat similar code should also consider themselves warned, whereas Eisenburg&#x27;s version makes it sound more like his complaint is specific to the case at hand - e.g. the especially poor formulation of the line criticized, compared to more elegant ways to use the overflow arithmetic functions, or the implementations of those functions.<p>- Nethercote explicitly noted that the rewritten version is much shorter, but actually it is missing two important factual details:<p>1. The claims that the code is not particularly safe, and inefficient even with &quot;magical compiler support&quot;.  (Eisenburg&#x27;s version just says it&#x27;s unclear and inefficient /without/ magic compiler support.)<p>2. The reason why Linus is pulling some random line to criticize out of a bug pull request containing many patches.  Issues with pull requests are usually merge conflicts, so is there an unstated issue with that here?  The actual rant makes it clear that the conflict just happened to make him notice that particular bit of code, which he found so distasteful that he felt he had to jump in.<p>By the way, I think Linus is full of crap: while the line at issue isn&#x27;t great, the use of those overflow-arithmetic functions in general is a great idea, considering how easy it is to screw up a manual overflow check in C, and how ridiculously frequently this results in real security vulnerabilities (among other issues), including of course in Linux in the past.  But that&#x27;s mostly orthogonal to his manner of expression.",1446647015

All these trust funds &quot;running out of money&quot; you hear about are simply the growth of those programs outstripping the IOU&#x27;s owed AND the amount congress allocates extra for additional growth.  You&#x27;ll get to a point where the growth spirals as lives are extended, etc<p>Debt is the place that you can start to install some controls.  That is why our media and congress always describe it as a &quot;showdown&quot; or &quot;battle&quot;.  The battle is quite lopsided because the vast majority of politicians in all parties don&#x27;t want to touch this and hate any boat rocking, and there&#x27;s a lot of lobbyists to pay back.<p>Can you honestly tell me what the spending priorities are for congress?  There are none!  Everything is important, and all budgets for every department may only grow based on their rules for baseline budgeting in the face of increasing divides between parties and people in government - in other words, the stalemate we&#x27;ve seen over the past 18 years results in budgets each year that are simply last year&#x27;s budget + 5% with occasional huge jumps in new spending whenever a crisis arises and everyone temporarily agrees to authorize new spending.<p>As I said, debt is the place to begin the place to begin debate about our spending priorities.  Why?  Because any new debt must be _authorized_, hence voted on.  It&#x27;s annoying to confront tough issues!  Hence all the acrimony.<p>Okay, so just look at your life, your security.  You think the system we have here is stable?  Its so fragile and full of corruption, look at what happened in 07-08 with the fraudulent loan scams the big banks were running.  And congress is the flashpoint for these crises every time.  So, I&#x27;m agreeing with you that there is potential for damage if we try to rein in the spending and get some priorities.<p>What&#x27;s the alternative that you are suggesting?

But when I dived into the details ClearTax makes things sound so simple and increases your procedures and you end up paying unnecessary tax. Luckily when I started I had evaluated ClearTax  and also liked it - its when I get into the details (the fine print of tax-laws) that my trust eroded off ClearTax.<p>ClearTax is also costlier than consulting a local practising CA (1.5 - 2x). However finding a good CA (or CA firm) and getting comfortable with them is a challenge. And it is worth pursuing the challenge. Even if I had to start again, I would consult a  local CA.  Also a good CA can help you save money and/or taxes (in legal ways). Apart from that I have heard that ClearTax has operational problems (like they miss out on filing returns when they are overloaded) - This last part is just from references and ClearTax might have solved it.<p>Note that the tax-laws for businesses in India are way complex and it is hard to understand those.

In TV and movies, you rarely see things in &quot;real time&quot; unless it&#x27;s specifically done for an effect (like the gimmick of &quot;24&quot; or to create some level of tension).<p>Normally, you compress time to a greater or lesser degree because you just don&#x27;t need to see every single action that someone takes in the course of a given hour or event.  Like you point out in the Python clip, you wouldn&#x27;t normally shoot the entirety of a guy running across a long field.  You&#x27;d show him start running, cut to a closer shot with him making progress, cut to the person/place he&#x27;s running toward for reaction or to re-establish the destination, and then cut back to the guy as he&#x27;s getting there.<p>When you drag these kinds of things out, it can be a good gag because it&#x27;s almost like a bad storyteller who includes every irrelevant detail.  It makes us uncomfortable and throws off timing.  In a more tense scene, time is often screwy because maybe you want to drag things out and show all of the characters&#x27; reactions to create anxiety and the feeling that &quot;they&#x27;ll never make it&quot;.<p>Anyway, thanks for the reminder about the Python bit.

This has about 50% of Alumina in it with typical density of ~4.<p>So it&#x27;s likely it would be around 3,3. More than aluminum, less than titanium.<p>But it&#x27;s supposedly about ~20 times more rigid than regular glass. For rigidity limited structure, you could make it so much thinner that you get significant weight savings. This could be important for glass fiber structures. Fiber vs. fiber, glass has been able to compete in strength with carbon fiber, but lack of rigidity is the downside.\nIncrease of stiffness might allow for usage of stiffer &quot;matrix&quot; (glue that holds the fibers together). That should increase overall strength. This limitation exists because if matrix is stiffer than the fibers, the structure will rip itself apart under load.<p>For strength or hardness limited designs, impossible to say. The article says nothing about it. Alumina is one of the hardest substances around, but I would not make any assumptions based on that. Typically it&#x27;s more about structure than the molecules involved.<p>For creep and fatigue resistant designs, bulk glasses are pretty useless because of their amorphous structure. Fibers can be used in fatigue situation though. Again the increase in stiffness and the possible increase of matrix stiffness could improve the situation. But the real thing here is how well the matrix can bind to the fibers. That again is impossible to tell.<p>Windshields? It&#x27;s big trade off really. Soft amorphic materials scratch easily. (By definition &quot;hardness&quot; is resistance to identation. Just add movement and you have scratching.) Typically &quot;hard&quot; amorphic materials suffer from cracking. This is because hardness usually comes with decreased ductility. But <i>fracture</i> <i>toughness</i> is function of stiffness and ductility. So this material could(?!?) improve hardness while being about as easy cracking as old windshiels. This would be good idea as windshield is mostly <i>mode of fracture</i> limited design. (It matters more <i>how</i> your windshield breaks, than how much energy it takes to break it.)",1446646202

It seems that people do not realize anymore that languages exist not only to pass the point along but also to express yourself (including emotions and feelings).<p>Further more I think that thanks to Linus being &quot;abusive&quot; it makes contributors think twice before they submit code and making sure the code is mostly valid, which in turn, results in higher quality code landing in the codebase and decreases the risk of potential bugs.

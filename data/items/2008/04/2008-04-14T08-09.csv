163031,comment,162672,162731,0,0,henning,,,"The classic anecdote about solving the wrong problem is asking engineers to deal with bicycle handle bars getting cold when it's cold outside: they design an expensive thermal heating system that weighs down the bike and makes the bike more expensive than the competition.<p>The non-engineer's response to the problem is to wear gloves.",1208162517

163029,comment,162672,162980,0,0,henning,,,"They certainly do measure abilities in a certain area, the question is whether that measures whether knowing why manhole covers are round can add value to an organization in the way that is currently desired for that position.<p>I don't see what connection stupid puzzles have to turning a spec or a vague, contradictory set of requests from a user into working code and working with other people.<p>Judging from friends who used to compete in mathematical olympiads, my educated guess is that the people who sail through the brainteasers are the ones who practice working on them (the way you prepare for a mathematical olympiad is to solve old mathematical olympiad problems).<p>Do you want to hire someone who spends their spare time working on job interview puzzles? Do you want someone who's delighted by answering ""why are manhole covers round?"" with the pointless, trite response of ""because manholes are round!"", which only begs the question? I swear to god those Joel on Software forum people get off on this crap.<p>Microsoft's problem is that you get fired if you look at open source code, so talking about neat open source side projects you did the way more enlightened companies like ThoughtWorks do is completely out of the question, which shows that they have much deeper problems than just figuring out the right interview questions.",1208162200

News.YC is an essentially self correcting system, in my experience, and can probably handle such content free links just fine.",1208161458
163019,comment,162803,162803,0,0,trekker7,,,"Well, the social news sites I already frequent have some central theme. Reddit is for general purpose news (so the most generic theme is already covered), Programming Reddit is for programming and technical articles, and Hacker News is for interesting articles and startup related links. What's the theme for your site?<p>To be honest the site lost me in the first minute because it didn't seem like I'd be interested in it. The theme wasn't apparent in the first 10 seconds. If it was a slickly designed site where people could upvote/downvote cool pictures of exotic sports cars, then maybe I would have stayed. There has to be a niche.<p>Plus, since there are a lot of other social news sites out there, and I already visit a bunch of them, it's going to be really tough to pull me to a new social news site. Perhaps try building something in a domain that nobody has really ventured into yet? We already have social video sharing, social image sharing, social news, and social profile databases. Maybe there's some new <i>category</i> of social websites that you and I haven't considered yet? Your chances in that new category might be better than with a new instance of the social news class.<p>""I built it but they didn't come"" is probably the leading complaint for the large percentage of startups that fail. You just have to be brutally, brutally honest and straightforward when analyzing your site. Put yourself in the shoes of an average visitor to the site: what does she read that catches her attention? How does she tell you apart from all the other sites on the Web that are similar to yours? Are you solving some burning need for this user that no other site can solve? What are you offering her that's going to make her bookmark your site and keep coming back? It's a really hard thing to do.<p>I'd suggest not just building one thing and waiting for people to show up. Rather, build a hundred things, each of which you think are pretty good, and then maybe 2 - 3 of them will become amazing hits.",1208161313

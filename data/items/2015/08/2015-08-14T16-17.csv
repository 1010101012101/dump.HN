Unlike retail&#x27;s cut of your selling price, Apple&#x27;s cut is completely arbitrary and rather unjustified.<p>If you sell software directly to users, the cost can be something like 3%, depending on which payment processor you want to use.<p>What additional service does Apple provide for that additional 27% cut? The buying experience is easier, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to translate into additional sales. You mention &quot;massive exposure,&quot; but there&#x27;s pretty much universal agreement among developers in the Apple world that the App Store&#x27;s &quot;marketing&quot; bump is pretty much zero unless you&#x27;re extremely lucky and get featured.<p>But hey, if it&#x27;s worth it, then you should be able to let developers choose and they&#x27;ll still go for it. On iOS, there is no choice. If you want to sell, it&#x27;s either Apple&#x27;s 30% or nothing.

10061214,comment,10055134,10057096,0,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"Yeah, I left out some of the details of the case, just because my comment was already long.<p>1) We heard a conversation between the senior officer and the arresting officer. (Actually a reading of a transcript of the conversation, because the original recordings were &quot;lost&quot;.) I don&#x27;t remember all of it, but the gist was the trainee asked if she should charge the defendant with a DUI and the senior office replied something like &quot;It&#x27;s your call. We could go either way.&quot;<p>2) The jury was never actually told the defendant&#x27;s BAC. I don&#x27;t know exactly why, but my impression is there was some technicality that made the test inadmissible.<p>3) We heard testimony from the arresting officer about the field sobriety test. However, she was a new officer still being trained, and this was only like the 5th real field sobriety test she had conducted. And the senior office had her restart it about halfway through, for reasons that we weren&#x27;t allowed to hear.<p>4) We heard testimony that the guy had drunk ~5 beers in the 2 hours before the cops arrived.<p>I&#x27;m sharing those now, because they&#x27;re the crux of the arguments I made.<p>I tentatively started out trying a line of reasoning that if the senior officer thought they could have not charged him, that means the cops have discretion about when it&#x27;s appropriate to enforce a law fully. And don&#x27;t we as jurors have a similar right. Isn&#x27;t that our role in this? If it&#x27;s just a matter of enforcing laws, a judge is better qualified. Our humanity and discretion is the point of having a jury of peers.<p>I tried reminding people of times when they probably broke this law, e.g., tailgating, at the beach, at a campground. There are lots of instances where somebody might have their key in the ignition, while consuming alcohol, but they shouldn&#x27;t be charged with a DUI. There&#x27;s the letter of a law and the spirit of the law. Yadda yadda.<p>I actually thought I was getting to some folks, until the foreman reread the judge&#x27;s instructions to the jury, which were basically, &quot;Your duty is to apply the law as it is given to you, whether you agree with the law or not.&quot; That type of wording is common in jury instructions, but I think it should be disallowed. It immediately shut down that whole semi-jury-nullification argument I was making. The rest of the jury felt they had to enforce the law – even though I tried to make the case that cops are also duty bound to enforce the law and they use discretion about when to charge people, likewise with district attorneys. They wouldn&#x27;t buy it. The judge&#x27;s instructions were too authoritative – or I wasn&#x27;t a good salesman.<p>So, I figured I&#x27;d pushed the jury nullification envelope as far as I could safely. I changed my tactic to argue that I didn&#x27;t think the guy was drunk – at least not beyond a reasonable doubt.<p>We didn&#x27;t find out his BAC. His sobriety test was inconclusive, for me. And while 5 beers in 120 minutes is a lot, this was a pretty big guy, probably 6&#x27;1&quot;, 230 lbs. That&#x27;s my general weight class, and I&#x27;ve used the BAC calculators before and played with a friend&#x27;s breathalyzer. I know I can have 3 (12oz, regular bav) beers per hour and stay right around 0.08%. (I wouldn&#x27;t drive after drinking 3 beers in an hour, but it&#x27;s good to be aware.)<p>So I just kept arguing that I wasn&#x27;t convinced that he was drunk. One of the other jurors actually got pretty belligerent, a few exchanges like this (almost verbatim):
Them: &quot;COME ON! You really don&#x27;t think he was intoxicated after chugging 5 beers? Is that how you party? Drink a sixer and hop in the car?&quot;
Me (ignoring the ad hominem bullshit): &quot;He probably was intoxicated. But likely is not the same thing as &#x27;beyond a reasonable doubt&#x27;. And I&#x27;m not giving this guy a DUI for possibly, maybe being intoxicated and playing music from his truck!&quot;<p>He kept pushing me, and finally I just turned to him and said, &quot;Look, I don&#x27;t <i>have to</i> convince you. I don&#x27;t have to even talk to you. I&#x27;m voting my conscience. You vote yours.&quot; That finally shut him up, mostly. In his defense, this was like hour 7 of deliberations.<p>I&#x27;m really glad I had this experience, but it was somewhat frightening to watch what the other jurors would do just because the judge gave them instructions. :(",1439571307

As the article states, they went &quot;to the manufacturer of the affected chip in February 2012 and then to Volkswagen in May 2013&quot;. Two years later the problem hasn&#x27;t been fixed, because a recall would be too labor intensive. Meanwhile VWs are still being stolen using this exploit. Now that the exploit is out there VW is forced to act.<p>And it&#x27;s not like regular people are going to turn into car thieves because this exploit has been made public. Not even house burglars will turn into car thieves.

However, the downside of this is that sometimes you want the scope to end early, and so you have to code around it.<p>With non-lexical borrows, the rules get much more complex: borrows are determined by the control flow graph, not lexical scope. However, you no longer need to code around those edge cases.<p>So the question of which is better really comes down to a question: do programmers find reasoning about lexical scope or the CFG more intuitive?

This article reports a meta-analysis that attempts to summarize the impact of background music. A global analysis shows a null effect, but a detailed examination of the studies that allow the calculation of effects sizes reveals that this null effect is most probably due to averaging out specific effects. In our analysis, the probability of detecting such specific effects was not very high as a result of the scarcity of studies that allowed the calculation of respective effect sizes. Nonetheless, we could identify several such cases: a comparison of studies that examined background music compared to no music indicates that background music disturbs the reading process, has some small detrimental effects on memory, but has a positive impact on emotional reactions and improves achievements in sports. A comparison of different types of background music reveals that the tempo of the music influences the tempo of activities that are performed while being exposed to background music. It is suggested that effort should be made to develop more specific theories about the impact of background music and to increase the methodological quality of relevant studies.&quot;<p>(It&#x27;s worth noting that despite a lot of theorizing and a few results, there&#x27;s still not a lot of evidence for personality traits mattering much, and it&#x27;s definitely worth noting that there&#x27;s a fairly consistent pattern of small negative mental effects even when people claim music helps.)",1439570719

So he&#x27;s in a middle ground where damages from the original arrest are unjustified, but damages resulting from his further actions are justified. If he hadn&#x27;t ran, he could have most likely posted bail.<p>But I don&#x27;t see anything fundamentally wrong with reimbursing OJ Simpson for the time of his criminal arrest and imprisonment, especially because that money would have just been used to settle the civil suit. Remember, <i>he was found innocent</i> (no double jeopardy + innocent until proven guilty). We both can say the system got the wrong answer for this case, but insinuations or references to a lower standard of proof don&#x27;t actually change the verdict.<p>Step back to a much simpler case of actual innocence. While walking down the street you are randomly arrested and held for a few days before you can post bail. What is the justification for the salary loss from your missed work being your responsibility, rather than the thugs&#x27; who caused it?<p>As far as encouraging judges/juries to find guilty for financial reasons. Do we want to hold back reforms on the fear that our system is so corrupt it will only worsen things? I can certainly see your scenario happening, but the proper course is to then fix those problems rather than give up and keep denying justice to victims of the &quot;justice&quot; system itself.",1439570505

Running with just 2 cables, the system remains nice and cool, the third one is there for backup. In case of failure, if resistance on one of the cables goes up, the electricity will naturally flow through the other 2 cables with less resistance. Any short in any of the 3 wires will instantly trip the 30 amp fuse. If, for some reason, 2 out of 3 cables get unplugged, but not shorted, for some reason. The last remaining cable does have a potential to overheat after hours of operation, but the fuse should blow way before any significant problem could occur.

    of tests on the effects of working with music. They polled a group of
    computer science students and divided the students into two groups, those
    who liked to have music in the background while they worked (studied) and
    those who did not. Then they put half of each group together in a silent
    room, and the other half of each group in a different room equipped with
    earphones and a musical selection. Participants in both rooms were given
    a Fortran programming problem to work out from specification. To no
    one&#x27;s surprise, participants in the two rooms performed about the same
    in speed and accuracy of programming. As any kid who does his arithmetic
    homework with the music on knows, the part of the brain required for
    arithmetic and related logic is unbothered by music—there&#x27;s another
    brain center that listens to the music.

    The Cornell experiment, however, contained a hidden wild card. The
    specification required that an output data stream be formed through a
    series of manipulations on numbers in the input data stream. For example,
    participants had to shift each number two digits to the left and then
    divide by one hundred and so on, perhaps completing a dozen operations
    in total. Although the specification never said it, the net effect of
    all the operations was that each output number was necessarily equal to
    its input number. Some people realized this and others did not. Of those
    who figured it out, the overwhelming majority came from the quiet room.</code></pre>",1439569182

When I had initially thought of similar ideas, Zendesk hadn&#x27;t moved an inch, but here lately they started getting into mobile support [2] so if anything I find it validation to the market that will just continue to grow.

However, this does not account for a whole class of subtle little interactions and questions that might be inconsequential one at a time but add up in aggregate to a whole new useful body of communication.<p>It&#x27;s when you turn to a co-worker to ask a quick question and open your mouth and then pause because you see them with headphones on, and then give up on asking the question, because the question is actually tiny.<p>In many many cases, that&#x27;s how it should be - people deserve their focus time, and we know how much programmer distraction costs. But there is also huge value in team members being available, in the serendipitous &quot;overheard&quot; tidbits that often save duplicated effort, keep the team cohesive and un-siloed. In kind exchanges, not requests to RTFM.<p>My point being that some (not all!) periods of time deserve to be &quot;open office hours&quot;, where people sacrifice some of their focus and invite others to bug them seemingly frivolously. That means taking off headphones and letting oneself be distracted, soliciting easy quick questions. It may seem to conflict a lot of <i>individual</i> productivity advice, but it can help grow the brain trust of the team as a whole.",1439568154

And that&#x27;s why standups work: you get a little face-time with your entire team, away from the desk, and it&#x27;s a chance to have everybody&#x27;s <i>undivided</i> attention for a minute or so and to get them rummaging around the attics of their brains for things that might be relevant to you.<p>You say what you did and what you&#x27;re planning on doing.

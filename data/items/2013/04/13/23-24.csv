My argument is that one of the reasons that people don't hire domestic help is because of moral qualms. Sometimes those qualms are unfounded, and in that case, an educational campaign to change attitudes may be an appropriate means to mollify those qualms and improve wealth creation across a community.<p>In your words, they are doing something less efficiently than they could, and need a reminder backed by a good argument for why they should hire someone else to handle those jobs.<p>""simply because you have accumulated more wealth""<p>That is part of a different argument. The mathematics I outlined are based on differential income, not wealth accumulation. That is, had I spent every penny of income or contributed it through taxes, such that I had less wealth accumulation than my gardener, it would still make economic sense for me to hire a gardener instead of tending to the garden myself. As you said, your goal is 'wealth creation across a community'. The scenarios I described are not incompatible with that goal. I can outline others if you wish.<p>Also, at that time my work was very bursty. I would sometimes visit a client site for a month or two, then not work for a few months. Her work was relatively constant, so she could maintain my garden while I was away. Even if I maintained the garden myself, I don't think it would be morally or economically objectionable to hire someone for that case.

This roughly equates to 360 Million people who live below the poverty line.<p><i>Are the numbers for poor accurate?</i><p>May be, may be not. Some believe these numbers could be as high as 77% specially considering the inflation rate and other factors.<p><i>Is it possible to live on 59 cents per day?</i><p>No but that's not even the main problem. Here is a comment from Jean Drze, an economist and former member of the National Advisory Council India [2],<p><pre><code>   What is really shocking is not that the official poverty line is abysmally low, but that even with that abysmal \n   benchmark, so many people are below it.The belated discovery that it is impossible to have a dignified \n   life on the official poverty line draws our attention to the appalling living conditions of the Indian poor. Taking a \n   position diametrically opposed to Mr. Bhalla and Mr. Panagariya, Mr. Drze argues, The message about the terrifying \n   nature of 'hidden poverty in India has been somewhat lost in the din of the recent debate.\n</code></pre>\nEven with such a low price point the number of poor in India are staggering.<p><i>Is there a class divide in India (in particular Delhi) and possess a sense of entitlement?</i><p>Yes. I would recommend reading on how the elite tried to stifle Delhi's first Bus Rapid Transit system by filing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Delhi HC [3]. Here is the reason from the petitioner's (a car owner in Delhi) on why he decided to file the petition<p><pre><code>    ""Car owners are the creators of wealth. Do you realise that they get exhausted sitting in their cars due to traffic \n    jams and they reach office completely tired? It affects their efficiency. Do you want them to perform less?"" asks the \n    main petitioner BB Sharan.You cannot keep a commander-in-chief waiting in traffic while his army is waiting for his \n    orders. How does it matter if a peon reaches office five minute before time?""\n</code></pre>\nThis is the attitude of the ""rich"" in India. The society doesn't matter as long as their work gets done.<p>[0] <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/news/press_pov1903.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planningcommission.nic.in/news/press_pov1903.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_pov.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_pov.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/what-does-indias-poverty-line-actually-measure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/what-does-indias-p...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19572583"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19572583</a>",1365896297

For instance, one of the Akka systems I built recently handles caching for large datasetsa given cache can take 20-30 seconds to compute.  Akka handles the computation while Play sits in front as a REST API.  Requests come in for a dataset and the data is either returned from the cache or generated.<p><i>But</i> if a request for a dataset comes in while the same dataset is already being computed, Play will return a Promise for the dataset already being cached.

I'd like to respond to the allegations being made on this string.<p>Regarding Orangethirty's statement, I don't know how you could claim that we sold any data. We absolutely do not sell any data. You should be more careful with your claims online, like many other startups we work really hard to do things by the book and build a strong reputation. Unless you have facts to back your claims up these sort of actions are very damaging to startup brands in their young lives.<p>Regarding Intellegacy's statement, CoFoundersLab does not have a call center, furthermore we don't even collect your phone number. Unless you are a Pro Member, at which point we collect a phone number for the credit card transaction. We do not use phone numbers for any other purpose. If you are not a Pro Member please mention that on this string, as it would be pretty cut-and-dry that we had nothing to do with the phone call you received since we don't have your phone number.<p>Regarding pain_perdu's allegations that we're doing anything wrong, I'd like to start with the following. You received a legitimate request from another member on CoFoundersLab to take an assessment. This member was presumably considering you as a co-founder and wanted to see how you matched up from a personality type assessment/entrepreneur archetype is what we refer that as. You then started the assessment but did not complete the assessment. At this point we did store your email on the BosiDNA system.<p>BOSIdna is a partner of CoFoundersLab. When you sign up for CoFoundersLab's FREE SERVICE you agreed to the following terms IF you take the assessment; ""By completing the archetype assessment, you agree to the Terms of Service of BOSI Inc. Find BOSI Inc.'s Terms of Service here: <a href=""http://www.bosidna.com/tos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bosidna.com/tos</a>. We rely on bosiDNA to conduct the assessment so you're also agreeing to their terms of use. So CoFoundersLab did not sell any information to bosiDNA, we have purchased a license from bosiDNA, we feel this is a valuable service and we provide it as an integrated experience for our members at no charge. bosiDNA has never paid CoFoundersLab for any service, and certainly not for our data. Therefore CoFoundersLab has not done anything wrong.<p>Having said all that, while bosiDNA reserves the right to email you; we do have an agreement that our members should not be contacted by bosiDNA directly without permission. There was a campaign that was sent out to a very small group of people inadvertently who were also CoFoundersLab members. I've confirmed with their CEO that issue has been resolved. This was an isolated case and will not happen again.<p>For those reading this, I want to further explain the email that was sent from bosiDNA was an invitation to join a free webinar. It went out to people who partially completed the bosi assessment to educate people about a free assessment.<p>It's a real slap in the face that CoFoundersLab provides a free service, made more than 25k introductions, all to help entrepreneurs launch new startups, and to be treated with such disdain is a real disappointment. I'd like to refer anyone reading this to <a href=""http://buzz.cofounderslab.com/Successful_Matches/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://buzz.cofounderslab.com/Successful_Matches/</a> to have a look at some of the successul entrepreneurs we're helping and assure you, we do not sell data to anybody, and that our mission and values are just, and we hope to make a huge impact on the entrepreneurs who are seeking great co-founders.<p>- Shahab",1365895887

At some point one can imagine a tipping point that it'll become a worthwhile investment for those that aren't super rich.  The assumption is the utility companies will act to protect their levels of revenue and raise prices to compensate.  This will result in more people investing in solutions.  Rince and repeat until your utlility companies are getting bailouts.",1365894121

E.g, every time a post contains the phrase ""steal software"", there will be someone saying ""you can only steal cars, not software"" and it will go on forever; same for eating meat/going veg, is Google evil or not, skeuomorphism vs flat design. I haven't ever learned anything from these discussions.<p>Too bad I have already started another weekend project :)",1365894102

It has not really gotten that much better in years.<p>Any new player cannot be just as good as google. It must be much better than google. If you manage to build something that is objectively better you can expect investors to shower you with money. Would not be surprised if google, facebook, MS would enter a bidding war to buy you. Don't know if Apple would be interested though.<p>The only way google can improve search is to drastically change their search algorithms. Perhaps throw away whatever they are doing right now and approach it from a new direction. This is the opening I believe new players have. A new approach to search, like contextual search will probably be enough to seriously threaten google.",1365894091

I'm floating around this half-baked idea of plugging Rasberry PI's into the light sockets of my home (since they're all central to the room [better for audio and microphone quality] and negates the need of running wire all over the place) so that I can have voice controlled computers in all my rooms and play music/make calls/automate my home/etc.  Being able to ask the computer some random question and get an answer without having to go to my computer would be insanely cool to me :)",1365894069

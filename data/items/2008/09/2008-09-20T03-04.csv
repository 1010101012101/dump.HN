I wonder how many clicks that cost them?<p>N.B.  As far as I can tell, this is a <i>prize</i>, not an investment, so calling the winners 'entrepreneurs' is a stretch.  They appear to be starting a charity, not a company.  And charities, while often noble in their intent, are not particularly sustainable; for sustainability, it's hard to beat a profitable company.<p>To paraphrase H.L. Hunt: if this world is worth saving, it's worth saving at a profit.",1221883171

They did not deserve to win this case and ruin Star's life.<p>Why don't the TSA employees go to jail when actual bombs get past the security checkpoints?  That's an actual risk.<p>Oh right, it blows the illusion of security theater.  Never mind.  I thought we were actually trying to protect the traveling public there for a second.  Silly me.",1221882572

Since she was just meeting a friend and wanted to impress him (her?), I just don't see the hoax intent.  It's like brushing your teeth and shining your shoes before picking up a friend at the airport -- not illegal.<p>Anyway, if she is appealing, I would like to donate some money to her legal fund so she can get a fair trial.",1221882383

309689,comment,309270,309487,0,0,boredguy8,,,"Uhh, no. But thank you for proving my point.<p>You're making two mistakes: a mistake between proof and belief and a mistake between types of claims.<p>I might believe you when you say it rained yesterday, but that certainly doesn't mean that you've done the work necessary to prove that it in fact did rain yesterday. To prove it, I'd need to see a video, examine the video for tampering, &c.<p>Similarly, if you said ""someone protected me from the rain by keeping a big umbrella floating over my head the whole day"", I'd need to see a video, examine the video for tampering, &c.<p>What do you know: the same evidentiary proof for two similar claims.<p>Notice how my second example uses a ""smaller"" thing than ""god reached down"" - the way you phrase it is entailing a whole bunch of metaphysical claims not entailed by the first claim. But two metaphysical claims can be examined using the tools available to us, and competing metaphysical claims would use similar evidentiary tools.",1221880671

I was arguing that those reasons for labeling atheism a belief are wrong.<p>To answer your post, I think the lack of evidence for all religions is a perfectly good counter. I think it shouldn't matter how long some idea has been around, or whether it appeals to our innate human instincts. But clearly both matter to a lot of people. As I'm not one of those people, I have no idea how to address this need.",1221880027

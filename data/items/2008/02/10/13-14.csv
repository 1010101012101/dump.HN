What you want is new insights being modded up - what you get is people being modded up for expressing well what everyone else is thinking, and modded down for dissenting.<p>I wish I could say that karma left me cold, but it doesn't - if somebody mods me down I feel insulted, if somebody mods me up it feels like praise.<p>To get on YC-topic, there's room for innovation here...",1202650727
112994,comment,112874,112874,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Sounds great, in principle. Here is what would happen if it actually occurred:<p>Various big projects of dubious value (particle accelerators, LIGO) will go begging for money. Any candidate who doesn't want to support them will be portrayed as anti-science. The majority of the effort will be placed here (scientists care more about grants than politics).<p>Standard science issues where the science doesn't fit the party line will be highlighted: evolution, climate change and sex ed. For the most part, science will be used as a club to beat republicans with. They certainly deserve it (1), but not only them.<p>Non-standard science issues that cut against democrats will be mostly ignored (race/sex differences in intelligence, lawyers suing doctors without scientific evidence, the possible link between abortion/miscarriage and breast cancer) . No one will ask the candidates what they think about Larry Summers or James Watson.<p>It sounds like a great idea. But I know my colleagues well enough to know that if it happens, it will simply turn into a ""give us money, we hate republicans"" event.<p>(1) At various points, I noticed birth control (non-condom) includes the warning ""Does not prevent aids or other STDs."" Until I heard McCain speak on the topic, I didn't think anyone was actually dumb enough to think it did.",1202650294

The upperhand you get when it comes to using phones as a platform is also very encouraging. It must be easier to engineer for the phones, when your actual data /content is itself small is'nt it.<p>So hence this discussion to think/rant on what you think could/coudnt be the next big 'micro' thing 8)<p>here's a list of a few i could think of that already exist or could become a reality pretty soon...<p>@micro-blogging \ntwitter, tumblr, ?<p>@micro-contacts/ids\nmicroformats have already shown the potential of this , ?<p>@micro-email\ndon't ask me why ,but i'm surprised i hav'nt see this already :D<p>@micro-html ?\nperhaps publishing for small dimensions like phones/google IG/netvibes/pageflakes? makes sense doesnt it...<p>@micro-photos , micro-videos\nperhaps an only thumbnail version of a flickr/youtube/etc (again could be adopted for avtars directory or nice drag'n drop playlist editor for videos) . another thing that would also make sense for phones/devices.<p>@micro-podcasting\nstarting with Qik, ?<p>@micro-playlists\ni think this is an awesome opportunity. be it a playlist of url's , video's or pictures ,being able to add a to-play while on the phone, and see your favourite micro-info . this would ofcourse need to have a micro-ecosystem of all kinds of data (ie. many of the micro's listed here) ,and being able to see each of them in the same dimensions. be it a biz card - or news or a blog post or video streaming<p>@micro-novels\nalready seen in japan via the use of twitter(that too published via phones!)<p>@micro-calendars\nperhaps on the lines of 'google agenda' version?<p>@micro- ????<p>Keep Clicking,\nBhasker V Kode",1202648820

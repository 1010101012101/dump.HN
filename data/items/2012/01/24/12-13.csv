A survey conducted by the International Coaching Federation (ICF) showed that 67.6% of people who went for coaching showed an increase in self-awareness, while 62.4% attributed coaching to smarter goal-setting. Of the coaching clients surveyed, 98.5% stated that their investment in coaching was worthwhile.  Madrid, 24 January 2012  The start of a new year is a time when many are seeking ways to improve their lives, but statistics reveal that only 46% of resolutions are maintained after the first six months. 80% of the reason that people dont achieve their goals is internal. Top Results Coaching enables people to identify limiting behaviour, creating a personalized coaching program to eliminate unproductive habits and obstacles preventing goal attainment, adopt new success techniques, learn new skills and create a mindset geared for success. Many people approach a productivity coach when they reach a point in life where they feel stuck, says Kirstin O Donovan of Top Results Coaching. When that point arrives, people start to feel that they no longer have control over their hopes and ambitions. Coaching offers a way forward, working with each person to help them achieve the results they want out of life.  Productivity Coaching Benefits Coaching provides an increased level of empowerment, while also helping to reduce stress, improve organization and time-management skills. Through increased productivity levels, quality of life is also improved.  In comparison to mentoring or consulting, coaching focuses on providing the skills that are needed to succeed, with support, motivation and on-going guidance offered along with tools that enable a shift in attitude and actions. Results can be drastic, with between 500 and 700% return on investment in most cases. Client, Maria Jose Casas, has experienced a significant difference since she began productivity coaching with Top Results Coaching.  Kirstin is a very positive and intuitive person. She has helped me to overcome difficulties in very different aspects in my life. When I started working with her, I felt depressed, insecure and confused. I used to see everything negatively. Since my first session she has been an incredible help in my lifestyle. I would really recommend her to anyone for whatever reason, professional or personal, says Maria.  As Kirstin says, If you dont invest in yourself, you wont have the quality of life you desire. Time is money, and time wasted is money wasted! Improve your productivity and achieve more in months than many people do in years. Kirstin O Donovan  Qualified Productivity Coach Based in Madrid, Spain, Kirstin O Donovan has been working within the Personal Development field over six years. Kirstin has a number of qualifications from numerous leading facilities, specialising in Life Skills Coaching, Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Stress Management along with productivity coaching.

What the person has actually forgot the password? How can they prove that they forgot something.\nShouldn't the court be the one proving stuff? Having to prove you have forgotten your password is like being guilty before being proven innocent.<p>Obviously, there are many cases where it seems extremely unlikely to us that someone has just forgotten his/her password, but as far as I'm concerned that does not constitute proof. (Otherwise, I think this would be one of those cases where people can get convicted just for being not very smart.)<p>> Not a bad idea in theory. However if the judge/jury can be convinced that you set up your password retrieving system specifically so that a search would destroy the password, they can still slap obstruction and contempt charges on you.

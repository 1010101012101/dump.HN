8112555,comment,8110907,8111513,1,0,peeters,,,"> you heat the whole house with hot water<p>As others have said, try cooling a house with rads.  It&#x27;s not like North America is oblivious to radiators; they were very much a standard way of heating houses before the popularity of AC made forced air a much more logical choice.<p>> Then you use insulation. This especially is something that feels nobody in the US has heard of. At least in California.<p>If you only know about the completely unrepresentative California, why expose your ignorance by projecting to all of the U.S.?  And further, why bother calling it &quot;the European model&quot;?  Obviously the way houses are built, insulated, and heated in a country like England or Norway is going to differ wildly from how it&#x27;s done in say, Greece.<p>Even <i>within</i> California the climate differs so much that there are 4-5 different building codes for insulation.  But in general, the minimum code for insulation in California is around half that of states with colder climates (e.g. R30 for ceiling in California, R50 for Wisconsin).",1406782722

Having worked in two different state governments for over 10 years of my IT career (some of it in management) I can assure you that most of the people in positions of power aren&#x27;t really forward thinking enough with technology and IT.<p>Also, most governments have made a feeble attempt to move toward a &#x27;one size fits all&#x27; type of IT structure.  This includes state run data centers, state-wide Active Directory structures, procurements services, buying from approved hardward and software vendors, yada, yada, yada.  They didn&#x27;t care that software from approved vendor A met 48% of my needs list whereas software from vendor B met 98% of my needs list at a fraction of the cost.  Vendor A had been approved by procurement and vendor B hadn&#x27;t.  How are we to know your Cousin Billy doesn&#x27;t own and run vendor B?  How do we know you aren&#x27;t receiving a kickback for buying from vendor B?<p>Which leads me to another ridiculous rule under State Government...I wasn&#x27;t allowed to receive anything from a vendor (worth > $10) as a gift, if it wasn&#x27;t also available to the general public.  So say I am interested in buying a server for $4500 and I&#x27;m on the fence.  The vendor wants to throw in 2 years of 7X24 technical support for 2 years if I buy the server from them.  NOPE.  If the general public can only buy the same server and get 5X8 for 1 year.  I wasn&#x27;t allowed to even (on the fly) negotiate a better deal.",1406782492

There are bad ones and great ones, but most are good enough.<p>Some people like the hustle and bustle and meeting new people every minute.  Others like a life of semi-solitude and private pursuits.  The attraction of controlling what happens on your own patch of dirt is so strong it has to be inbuilt.<p>The key to suburban living is careful neighbourhood selection.  When it comes to families, coffee shops and cinemas mean nothing, but parks, walks and schools mean everything.  It&#x27;s hard for young single people to grok that, but it&#x27;s very true.

Searching for a value in an array is much more akin to searching for a needle in a haystack.<p>So, for array functions, it&#x27;s like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Where most older homes would have people in the backyard, I&#x27;m in my climate controlled living room.<p>I hire a guy to come by every two weeks and mow my lawn. He charges me $30 each time. I used to do it myself, but I decided to spend my time doing other things. If I did it myself, yard maintenance is unbelievably cheap and not <i>all</i> that time consuming, a half hour every 2 weeks. I probably didn&#x27;t even get through 3 gallons of gas over an entire season and I&#x27;ve had the same lawnmower for 6 years. I don&#x27;t water my lawn, it&#x27;s pretty brown right now.<p>I use the pool system (we have 4) a handful of times during the summer, but I don&#x27;t mind paying for it as part of my fees since at least I have the option. The pool houses double as community centers and party spaces which is nice. I can take cheap yoga classes in one year round, I think it&#x27;s $5 a class.<p>I don&#x27;t use the playgrounds and don&#x27;t have any kids, but my wife and I make extensive use of the private park and trail system in my development. The central park is about a half-mile long (almost exactly long as NYC central park is wide), wooded, filled with trails (a circuit is about 2km), a small lake, adult exercise equipment, tennis courts, a field hockey pad, a basketball court and a few open green spaces. But there&#x27;s something like 20 more miles of trails and smaller parks and green space all throughout. It&#x27;s all immaculately maintained.<p>At one end of the park is a small amphitheater where they throw a summer concert series. We get our own 4th of July fireworks show too.<p>If I lived in a dense Manhattan style city, I&#x27;d probably end up spending it all on building fees, higher rent and significantly higher grocery prices.",1406779629

But the uses I have seen of linear algebra in machine learning are essential to achieving performance. There, the algorithms are often highly iterative, using the same exact source data. To perform such calculations with a loop is extremely inefficient. Even chasing pointers can be a significant cost. There is a reason why Fortran code is generally faster than C for linear algebra out of the box.<p>Also see: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/146186"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/146186</a>",1406779615

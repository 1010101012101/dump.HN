Although the pattern described is a relatively common pattern across a lot of ""webapps-at-scale."" For example, the CTO of Trip Advisor recently talked about how Trip Advisor is a series of distinct services exposing APIs that all run separately and are pulled together for a page render[1]. At some point most growing web apps simply outgrow the ability to be a single monolithic PHP/Rails/Python/whatever app and need start breaking things up.<p>Although, it seems like TPM is seeing benefits from this that go outside the typical reasons folks start to go this route, like outgrowing a single relational database or wanting teams working on different components to be able to work and deploy independently of each other.<p>[1]<a href=""http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-architecture-40m-visitors-200m-dynamic-page-view.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/6/27/tripadvisor-archit...</a>",1310684080

2765514,comment,2763182,2765074,7,0,bartonfink,,,"I can demonstrate it the way people have been demonstrating work ability for years - through a resume and an interview process. I put nothing on my resume I'm not prepared to talk about from start to finish, and I assure you that I've got no trouble finding work I find intellectually and financially agreeable. It doesn't always correlate with my academic interests, but to assume that I'm missing out on opportunities I'd like to have access to is somewhat less than logical.<p>People have a tiny itch and write a tiny program to solve that itch. That's fine - I have nothing against someone doing that. However, to take that tiny program and others like it as more than minor evidence of programming ability is a huge leap of faith that I'm not prepared to accept.<p>For example: I work with a guy who just released an Android app that is a Starcraft 2 build order trainer. It runs a timer and displays an image of what you should be building in the game at that exact moment (assuming perfect efficiency). The idea is that you plug in the order you want to build units ahead of time, and you're ""racing"" the timer to become more efficient. Supposedly he has about a hundred downloads, so it's not a huge success but it's also not an abject failure as far as apps go. Here's my problem. It doesn't DO anything.<p>It doesn't suggest reordering your build to account for obvious problems (e.g. never building a military unit). It doesn't optimize your build to account for obvious parallels (e.g. it won't tell you it's stupid to queue up units for production when you could put your resources to work elsewhere for immediate benefit). It doesn't even track wins/losses that I know of. It basically displays a series of images based on a script that you provide.<p>I'm sure it's very well written software based on the contributions he makes to our codebase at work, but it doesn't say very much about him except ""here's a guy who was able to write one mobile app."" He's not bad at coding, but he's really not great at solving ill-defined problems, and that costs him when he's confronted with something new. For example, he spent a week as part of a performance effort writing an aspect to generate timestamps whenever a method was called and when it returned. This sort of thing is commonly known as a profiler, a tool which we had access to from the start and which would have worked fine for our purposes. He didn't know about that, and wasted a week getting AspectJ set up and configured and writing his homegrown profiler while the rest of us were making actual, obvious performance improvements based on data from a real profiler.<p>Yet, according to popular wisdom on this thread, his SC2 app proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is a demonstrably superior developer to someone who doesn't code in their spare time. Most of the apps and hobby programs I'm aware of fall into this category. My point is that a program is a solution to a problem, nothing more. If you're trying to hire someone to solve problems (e.g. an engineer or developer - what have you), a demonstration that this person can solve relatively trivial problems should not be taken as a bell-ringer for engineering talent like it frequently is.",1310683870

Granted, it's nowhere near the facebook level of penetration but my actual interactions with friends on it have been of higher quality (I barely use facebook so that may have a strongly confounding effect on my results), largely because I can control who different types of content goes to.<p>I think the pervasiveness of G+ is going to go a long way in continuing to drive adoption and use. Facebook feels like a place I go to waste time, while G+ is always there when I'm inside of anything google (and between gmail, calendar and search that's at least once or twice an hour).",1310681478

Software is easier to manage and more flexible if each piece does one thing and does it well, with as little overlap with other components as possible.  This is what makes OOP a good system for designing large programs.  I helps people separate out the various components so that maintenance is of many small pieces with clearly defined boundaries instead of one large piece with none.<p>Separating out these services into their own ""apps"" is like splitting up classes.  It's a natural and good way to increase maintainability and flexibility.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns</a>",1310681460

To an extent some of these websites are already doing something like this peer-to-peer - Facebook is an OpenID consumer, for example.  Maybe sometime in the future this will be a big issue.

The reason it never really took off is mostly due to OSA itself, and not the scripting language I think.<p>For instance most of the Adobe product don&#x27;t care about OSA and offer a Lua extension mechanism instead (even there, I feel they only cared avout filters and publishing modules). Or even iPhoto had severe limitations on what could be done through the scripting interface.<p>The Finder has perhaps the most useful interface, but anything done there can also be done in the shell IMO. There must be other apps exposing very useful functionalities to OSA, but I haven&#x27;t see many.",1402217981
7864288,comment,7862456,7862456,2,0,quotient,,,"I agree that taking notes by hand allows me to focus better on the lecture, improves recall, and is generally more engaging. Yet I still choose to take notes on my laptop. Why?<p>I first note that there are, in my opinion, two major types of lectures: there are those in which I only need to note down major ideas and in which it is more important to listen to the lecture, and those which move more quickly, making it necessary to note down everything, as a single omitted detail can cause hours of confusion later on.<p>It is clear that for the first type of class, handwritten notes are just as good as those taken on a computer. There is little difference between the two, practically.<p>For the second type of class, however, it is clearly easier to type notes. Most people type faster than they handwrite, and with reasonable proficiency in LaTeX, anyone is able to more or less type up an entire lecture of notes quite easily.<p>But my reason for typing notes goes beyond that: the major issue I have with handwriting my notes is the inevitable accumulation of loose-leaf paper, and the ensuing confusion. I have only rarely actually managed to keep together an entire set of handwritten notes on a class. More rare is the case in which I actually manage to decipher my own handwriting later on, and rarest of all for me is actually going over handwritten notes. For some reason, I (virtually) never bother revisiting my handwritten notes. Organizationally, handwriting my notes is an enormous hassle that I cannot deal with. It just never works out.<p>Electronic notes --- I keep a single .tex/.pdf for each class --- are much easier to maintain, organize, and browse later on. I can continue making revisions, add hyperlinks to relevant web resources, etc. Moreover, as they are (when you are sufficiently quick) easier to take than handwritten notes, it&#x27;s also easier to thus create a <i>complete</i> set of notes that cover everything.<p>I recognize that by transcribing all my lectures in real-time, I am probably missing out on some of the experience I would have if I were more immersed in my professors&#x27; lectures, although I feel that I should point out that despite taking notes electronically, I am quite immersed. After some time of practice, I&#x27;m able to listen and pay reasonably close attention to the lecture while I&#x27;m just typing as the professor speaks. I would probably be more immersed if I were not taking notes at all, or very few, on a piece of paper, but as it is, having a complete set of typeset notes is just far more valuable to me (not to mention the value to the other students, and occasionally even to the professor --- I often distribute my notes to others).",1402217978

Developers ignored it.<p>2) UIApplication.sharedApplication.delegate vs UIApplication.sharedApplication().delegate  - nope.  It isn’t more concise.  It appears to be a wee bit more verbose.<p>3) Some benchmarks on the web are saying otherwise.  It adds extra bridging and ARC for numbers.  I don’t see how it can be faster and even if it is - nobody cares about speed. If I need to beat it, I can drop to C, IMP cache, and kick Swifts sorry little ass.<p>4) Safer - like the TSA says flying without nail clipp\ners is safer?  It doesn’t solve any problems I actually have. I think my last type error was in 2005 - took about a minute and a half to find it.  I routinely work in dynamically typed languages and avoid static typed languages like the plague they are.  I’m not opposed to type annotations when they help, but these just look like cargo cultism - like a lot Swift’s silly “features”.<p>5) It has less features where it counts - basically a less capable object model, weaker meta model, and more budensome interaction with C code than Objective C and a number of useful Objective C features have been walled off.  I have Objective C code that cannot be written in Swift.<p>6) Except for that kind of dynamic stuff like performSelector: afterDelay: withArguments: and that pesky NSInvocation that isn’t available.<p>There are better projects around than this pile of crap.

7864264,comment,7863499,7863499,3,0,joshontheweb,,,"I recently had a lucid dream for the first time.  Really interesting experience.  It was triggered by the fact that I plunged to a city at the bottom of the ocean and could still breath.  I realized this was impossible and became lucid.  I decided to try and have some fun with it so I &#x27;willed&#x27; myself to have a gun.  It worked, kind of.  I had something in my hand that i could shoot with but it was sort of undefined.  Kind of like if you are playing a 3d fps and the texture for your gun doesn&#x27;t load properly.  It was kind of amorphous and brown and glitchy.

The plaintiffs also get nothing if they don&#x27;t sue, and if they do they have a chance at a huge windfall. Imagine how many bad patents you could litigate with and lose if you could win one claim for $200 million dollars.<p>One of the (many) problems with software patents is that because the scope of what software does is so broad, what an individual patent would rightly be worth sounds extremely small, and so their worth tends to be vastly overestimated when not taken in the proper context.<p>You look at something like an iPhone, it&#x27;s probably covered by thousands of patents. Cellular wireless, wifi, video codecs, audio codecs, encryption algorithms, web browsers, app stores, music stores, digital telephony, media library functions, printing, Airplay, etc. etc. Each of those will be claimed by dozens if not hundreds of patents. And &quot;1% of revenue&quot; sounds small when you&#x27;re not taking that into consideration, even though in reality 1% is <i>huge</i>. Even calling it 1% of the value of all patents covering the device is ridiculous, and revenue has to cover at least a couple of non-patent sources of costs like manufacturing, distribution, marketing, etc.<p>There is an obvious absurdity if there exist 1000 patents that could each be considered to be worth 1% of revenue when you only look at them one at a time.",1402215428

Last year was interesting, as or-tools[2] won a bunch of categories after a long reign by Gecode[3].<p>For those that don&#x27;t know much about constraint programming: it is a declarative programming paradigm for solving highly combinatorial problems.<p>The basic idea is: you model your problem as a set of variables and a set of rules (constraints) on what values those variables can have in order to be a solution to your problem. For example, for two variables x and y, you might express the constraint that x ≥ y.<p>Once you&#x27;ve characterized your problem in this way, you can basically press a button and the constraint solver will find you one or all solutions by a combination of search and inference which intelligently pares down the search space. For best results, you can also specify the search strategy for the solver.<p>More interesting than the simple constraint example given above are global constraints, which can express relationships for more variables and can therefore use more intelligent inference than simple pairwise constraints. The traditional example is the all_different(x_1,...,x_n) constraint, which ensures that the variables upon which it is operating take on distinct values.<p>A lot of constraint programming research is oriented towards finding good algorithms for global constraints. These can then be re-used by any model which needs to express the same kind of relationship. There are already quite a lot of these; they can be found in the global constraint catalog[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.minizinc.org/challenge2014/challenge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minizinc.org/challenge2014/challenge.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/or-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/or-tools/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gecode.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gecode.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.emn.fr/z-info/sdemasse/gccat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emn.fr/z-info/sdemasse/gccat/</a>",1402214760

So the language grew organically in ways that were hard to predict, rather than having a clear philosophy and a long-term trajectory.

7263352,comment,7263088,7263088,30,0,einhverfr,,,"To be honest though, the UK has been beyond laughable for a few years on this now.<p>During the great Icelandic banking crisis, the UK government used anti-terrorism laws to seize assets held by Icelandic banks.  I quipped at the time that maybe they were worried about the assets being used to buy lumber for longships from Norway and wealthy bankers going a-Viking again.  They might furthermore give the folks up in Orkney ideas and what then?  Lose Caithness and Sutherland?  That&#x27;s an existential threat there....<p>If it was legal to use anti-terrorism laws in that case against a foreign entity far removed from any real terrorist activity (moreso than, say, the British-owned HSBC), then it is hard to see how antiterrorism laws wouldn&#x27;t be perfectly legal here or anywhere else.

7263347,comment,7262662,7262662,3,0,captainmuon,,,"Besides the technical measures in the other comments, there are a bunch of other tricks that might be useful. (Please don&#x27;t take this as advice, but just as a thought experiment! If I were writing a spy novel, these are some things my characters would do.)<p>Find a homeless person, and ask him/her to register a bank account in exchange for some cash or a meal. Use that account to set up your website anonymously. You&#x27;ll find that you need to dirten money if running such an operation - reverse laundering or taking &quot;clean&quot; money and putting it untracably into the business. Such a proxy account is a vital ingredient.<p>Don&#x27;t rely on Tor alone. It might be completely subverted, you wouldn&#x27;t know until it&#x27;s too late. Buy access to a botnet and route your stuff over it.<p>Have multiple servers. If you have one single server, its easy to trace. Either by brute force: the ISPs disconnect/slow down 50% of customers for a split second, depending on wheter your site went down or not they know in which half you are, repeat until they find you. There are much more sophisticated techniques that don&#x27;t require active interference. But if you have at least two or three identical servers at different locations, it makes it a lot harder to catch you. Don&#x27;t forget tamper-proofing your servers.<p>Have trustworthy accomplices. Generally, the less people you tell what you are doing, the better. But if you have a close circle of people you can really trust, it becomes much easier to pull this off. You can work from multiple locations, give each other alibis, etc..<p>Build fake personas. Don&#x27;t just take a pseudonym, but create fake identities. Keep records on their interests, their motivations, what you disclosed about them. The purpose is to throw investigators off. You should be aware of techniques used by them, such as behavioral analysis, stilistic analysis, etc.. Working with accomplices can help alot in creating these fake identities and concealing your own (e.g. writing style).<p>Go somewhere safe. If possible, move your servers, or even yourself, somewhere where what you are doing is not punishable, or the authorities can be bribed.<p>This list could go on for ever... I&#x27;m not sure how practical many of these ideas are, but one thing is clear, you&#x27;ll need a certain amount of &quot;criminal energy&quot; to pull this off - no matter whether your intentions are criminal or not. (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m too pussy to actually have done any of the above, so it may or may not work :-))",1392814601

7263170,comment,7261003,7261247,2,0,SimHacker,,,"When designing pie menus, there are both physical (articulatory) and mental (cognitive) factors that you should consider when choosing the number of items and their directions.<p>Gordon Kurtenbach and Bill Buxton did an experiment that varied the number of menu items and measured the selection time and error rate. They expected the selection time to be monotonically increasing as they added more items. To their surprise, that was almost true, except for the transition from seven to eight items. It was quicker to select from an eight item menu, then from a seven item menu!<p>That, I believe, was because of the effect of the cognitive bottleneck of associating the items with which direction to move, not the physical difficulty of moving in those directions. While the slices of the seven item menus were wider and had more area than the slices of the eight item menus, and Fitts&#x27; Law would predict that seven item menus were faster than eight item menus, Fitts&#x27; Law does not take into account the time it takes for users to map their intended command to the direction of that command, and how the mental framework in which users remember and relate the directions to each other affects selection time.<p>Eight item menus have all of their items in well known directions, each of which is associated with a very familiar concept, which come in nice pairs, and the pairs come in convenient orthogonal groups, like up/down, left/right, vertical/horizontal/diagonal, like compass directions.<p>Twelve item menus like a clock face also work well, especially for circular sets of items like hours, months, zodiac signs, etc. But the effect going from 11 to 12 is not as dramatic as from 7 to 8. But still the 12 item menu has a nice familiar aesthetically pleasing cognitive framework (including opposite and orthogonal pairs, first tier vertical/horizontal axes and second tier in-betweens) that you can often exploit, depending on the content.<p>Three item menus are still slightly faster than four item menus, because the effect of the proportional difference in target area overwhelms the difference in the number of items, and two of three triangular directions are well known concepts that are pretty easy to remember, compared to six of seven directions.<p>An eight item menu optimally exploits that effect, while a seven item is unfortunately sub-optimal with mostly difficult to remember directions. There&#x27;s no word or concept in the English language for six out of seven of those directions -- they&#x27;re all just kind of slanted differently, similar to but not quite like the well known compass directions, and there are no nice symmetries, opposite or orthogonal groupings to exploit, by arranging complementary items in opposite directions, independent pairs along orthogonal axes, etc.<p>So if you&#x27;re designing a pie menu with seven items (or even eleven), it&#x27;s better to just throw another item in to bring it up to eight (or twelve)! I gave an example in the DDJ article of a &quot;seven days a week&quot; menu with an additional &quot;today&quot; item thrown in at the bottom to bring it up to eight, with the weekend and today in the lower part of the menu, and Wednesday at the top. See, I don&#x27;t even have to link to a picture or enumerate every item for you to easily visualize and remember it!",1392811385

The problems they are trying to solve take for granted all I know, all I struggle with, and all I still haven&#x27;t even learned yet.<p>The more I &quot;level up&quot; in development, the more I&#x27;m convinced there is not enough attention paid to how to really advance through those levels.

We can&#x27;t just time ourselves writing a script, like in the olympics, so almost all of us have a hugely overinflated or underinflated sense of our own skill. Everyone has hundreds of anecdotes proving their value over those who by any metric would be our betters (years of experience, languages mastered, formal education, etc).<p>I&#x27;m reminded of when I was a brand new developer in my first job, how pleased with myself I was at my commit messages, compared to my officemate. Sure, he worked on patching a financial aid system written in three languages, two of which I&#x27;d never even seen, and I only wrote sql queries to be run by hand, but I knew what made me better: commit messages.<p>This confirmation bias is one reason I like pair programming, especially between two partners of different levels.

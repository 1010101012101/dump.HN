It is possible to write a query like this but handling n+ steps (A..B, A..B..C, A..B..C..n) is eventually going to make your query optimizer sh*t all over itself in all likeliness. You're not simply joining two tables but you also have a temporal relationship between each event. For example, if you're looking for users who performed events A then B then C, then you need to self join B to A making sure that all events in B are after A and then all events in C are after B.<p>Beyond that you have to worry about whether A, B and C are all within the same session. Trying to define a session such as ""all events that occurred until there is 30 minutes of idle time"" is going to be damn near impossible in the SQL query.",1340819884

There are a lot of really great discussions in posts by more ""popular"" designers that I wish we saw more of in shots for those who are still up-and-coming.<p>A big reason why I disagree with this sentiment so much is because it has become less a place where you post your progress and methods and more a place to hype your startup, post your better idea of an app or site or just plain steal a style from another designer. There's very little ""process"" and a lot of sleek, shiny finished concepts. A lot of early-adopters, regardless of their talent, have thousands upon thousands of followers that keep their posts above everyone else's in the Popularity algorithm. A lot of these posts could really use improvements, but instead you see comment upon comment praising the designer.<p>I think this is a huge flaw because we're giving credit where credit might not necessarily be due. We're stroking egos and supporting bad UI and UX because posting a comment on a popular user's page means more click-throughs to ours. This is a flaw in the community and I strongly believe more emphasis on critique would help bridge the gaps we see in poor design, UX and help people feel more at ease about not only <i>giving</i> criticism but <i>receiving</i> it.<p>> <i>If Dribbble really cared about fostering a community of critical feedback and conversation..</i><p>If Dribbble really cared about a lot of things, the site wouldn't look and work the way that it does.

I brought up Egypt, Israel, Yemen and other dictatorships and I did not intend to start a flame war. I have no argument with ""all Jews"" or ""all Israelis"" and I admire that you oppose evicting people and you support at least some solution even if it is a two state solution that gives the non-Jews the remaining 22% of the land that was occupied in 1967, that would be a good start.<p>""The conflict is two-sided.""
The South African conflict was a two-sided conflict and so was the American Civil rights struggle. In case of Israel I don't think any Palestinian military is occupying Israeli civilian population, I don't think Palestinians are denying food to enter Israel, I don't think Palestinians are shooting Israeli fishermen in Israeli waters, or shooting pro-Israelis in International waters, it's Israel that's doing all of that to Palestinians. One side is the occupying power and the other is occupied.<p>""The whole purpose of Israel was creating a refuge for Jews from around the world, because it became historically clear that Jews need it.""<p>It did not have to be at the cost of Palestinians. In late 1800s the Jewish population of Palestine was less than 3%, even as late as 1914 the Jewish population was only 8%, in 1948 it was 34% and that population kicked out 750,000 of the local population (about 80% of the total Palestinian population) and declared Israel on 78% of the land.<p>Here's a hardcore Zionist Israel Zangwill in 1905:<p>""Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already twice as thickly populated as the United States, having fifty-two souls to the square mile, and not 25% of them Jews ..... [We] must be prepared either to drive out by the sword the [Arab] tribes in possession as our forefathers did or to grapple with the problem of a large alien population, mostly Mohammedan and accustomed for centuries to despise us."" (Righteous Victims, p. 140 & Expulsion Of The Palestinians, p. 7-10)<p>""Singling Israel out is not honest and is in fact a form propaganda.""<p>I did not single out Israel, I mentioned about half a dozen names. No one here justified Saudi, Yemeni or Bahraini repression, why are you singling out justifying Israeli repression? I don't like $1.3+ billion of my tax dollars being sent to Egyptian dictators nor $3+ billion of my tax dollars to Israeli occupation and apartheid, nor the weapons to Bahraini apartheid, I'm not singling out Israel. Even if someone is more vocal against Israel, you should know why it is so, Israeli is getting more US taxpayer money and indirect subsidies than all other countries of the world combined (the direct aid alone is more than what we give to entire Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, given the GDP per capita of Israel, we should be outraged at that military aid Israel or Egypt or Bahrain are getting).",1340818588

I've never seen one application skew across versions so hard, or single-handedly fragment the space as much. (BTW kudos to MS for strongly encouraging their IE users upgrade).<p>What makes this perplexing is that Google has solved this problem with most of their other installed software offerings, Chrome particularly. There's basically only one version of Chrome (v 19 as I write this). Heck, even MS realized their mistake and is making efforts to roll up old IE users into the latest version. And of course Apple has done a fantastic job keeping all of it's users at the same iOS version.<p>I am well-aware of the OEM madness that drives Android fragmentation, and that you might think it's not ""Google's fault"" because of this.

I believe the Python developers anticipated this, struggled with it, but did it anyway because they believed it to be the right call in the long run. I'm hoping they will be right, because I do enjoy programming in Python 3 more than I did programming in 2.<p>Would it have been a better call to work on problems like the GIL instead? Perhaps. Certainly many, yourself included, would consider that a more significant problem to solve than the comparatively minor touchups that Python 3 did to the language. However, I do tend to disagree there: I think that the slow accretion of cruft that bogs down a language over time is a more significant problem and more likely to cause a language to fall out of favor. And I think the timing works out in such a way that Python can recover the lost momentum from the transition in time for projects like PyPy to come up with a good answer to the GIL.<p>So, yeah, we disagree ultimately, but thank you for explaining your POV better.

Task an editor with fixing that broken XML by hand (can't go back to the vendor due to extremely tight deadlines).<p>4. Complain to the vendors and hope they listen for next time.<p>5. Have the editor manually upload said XML to various hosting services.<p>When that miserable list became my responsibility, I quickly turned to automation. I wrote scripts to fix up the bad XML, upload the content where it needed to go, send out emails to interested parties, and so forth.<p>""Fabulous!"" they said as they heaped on the work. I pushed my capabilities even further by writing more software to pump out ebook files and do other cool stuff. And I wrote long white papers about how we might modernize our broken electronic publishing procedures.<p>But by this time, nobody was interested. I had become totally typecast as the <i>widget maker</i>, the guy that makes the cheap XML go zoom. None of the artsy credentials that brought me on board in the first place (English degree, writing portfolio, etc.) seemed to matter anymore. I was the tech.

It's poor practice not to.""<p>I would argue that it is poor practice to support them.<p>First is cost.  Even if it only takes 10 grand to make a site ""functional"" in x browser, rebuilding an application to fully work with ie7 does not.  If it takes 15-20% (or greater) more development time to add in support for IE7, but IE7 does not provide 15-20% increased revenues (it won't, unless you're making business software specifically for tech-agnostic corporations).  You might say oh, it doesn't take 15-20% more time... just use jQuery and magic will happen.  No man.  It takes much more time.<p>Second is more philosophical.  Assuming you are a consumer focused company like AirBnB, you customers are fully capable of upgrading to a new browser.  There are no IT limitations on a personal computer.  It takes all of 5 minutes and is completely painless.  Stop coddling IE7 users; it is obsolete.<p>As far as pages working without JS: this is 2012, not 2002.  If you still treat today like you treated 10 years ago, you really have no business complaining about anything on the internet.  The internet is not for you, and neither is a site like AirBnB.

However, it is well understood (see bugs.python.org and search for ""GIL"") that the GIL causes performance problems in otherwise correct and performant Python code. For example, such programs can run <i>more slowly</i> if there are more cores available than if there is only a single core available. Various workarounds to the GIL implementation in CPython have been proposed to address these problems, and it's better in Python 3.X, but the problems still exist.<p>And one still cannot write true multithreaded programs in Python using the language's standard thread library. To use all the cores, you have to resort to the processing module, which relies on processes rather than threads; this vastly increases the memory consumption, and makes the resulting programs less idiomatic as well.

I am merely stating what I believe to be a fact.<p>I see a lot of opinions on HN that obviously come from people who have never actually run a business.  Of course, everyone is entitled to an opinion with the caveat that opinions loose a lot of validity when they are not backed by ""skin in the game"".<p>Bringing an employee onboard is an expensive process.  The search itself can be expensive.  If you found the employee through an agency you owe the agency a finder's fee.  This typically runs from 15% and could be as high as 50% of the employee's salary.  To put numbers to that, if you pay someone $100K and the agency charges 25%, you, the employer, owe them $25K.<p>Of course, it doesn't stop there.  There's a lot more to employee compensation than the agreed-upon salary and recruiting costs.  A quick Google search located this calculator:<p><a href=""http://www.artlogic.com/resources/employee-cost-calculator/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artlogic.com/resources/employee-cost-calculator/i...</a><p>Using that as a reasonable reference I calculated that, if you keep your $100K/year employee for three years your annual cost is $150K per year.<p>If, however, you only keep them for one year (change ""Expected term of employment"" to ""1"") the cost goes up to $170K per year.<p>If we look at a $150K/year employee who leaves in one year the cost of that employee sits at around $240K.<p>Even this doesn't paint the entire picture.  Bringing someone onboard takes work and will definitely consume clock cycles.  More than one team member is likely to be involved in the on-boarding process.  Overall productivity will be affected during this period until the new hire comes-up to speed and can ""solo"" if you will.  The effort isn't trivial at all and it costs thousands of dollars for every hire.<p>There's also a hidden ""cost"" which takes the form of internal competitive data that you have to trust your employees with.  Nobody thinks that this is a cost until you go through the experience of training someone for months only to have them go work for a direct competitor.  These things do happen, and believe me when I say that it never sits well.  At that point thin ethical walls protect you from a competitor gaining a leg-up through ill-gotten insight.  This very directly equates to money.<p>The cost of poaching by --presumably-- the very agency you might be working with is also not trivial.  You just dedicated a ton of money and time to bring someone onboard and the agency convinces him/her to go elsewhere.  Now you are left with a hole to fill, which will take time and money.  During that time team productivity will take a hit, product delivery will suffer and you will be distracted away from product and business development in an effort to fill the hole.  I can't put a precise number on this but believe me when I say that it ain't cheap.<p>So, yes, anti-poaching is fair and just.  For some it takes going through the pain of having this happen once or twice to understand the concept.",1340816734

I didn't claim arbitrary parallel programming should be easy; just that the GIL causes multi-threaded programs written in standard style in Python to not work properly in CPU-bound contexts, because the GIL prevents these programs from using all the cores available, and, furthermore, because even in single-core contexts it is prone to performance failure modes such as convoying and starvation that induce <i>worse</i> performance when there are more cores available. (cf. very extensive discussions in bugs.python.org on GIL problems, along with David Beazley's, Antoine Pitrou's, and others' attempts to address them).<p>It is a standard, uncontroversial expectation of general purpose languages that offer threading that the threads run in parallel, using the available cores. I don't believe this needs substantiation any more than the claim that general purpose programming languages should run serial programs deterministically.<p>I believe the better course for Python post 2.X would have been to fix the core problems with the language's reference implementation, while maintaining backward compatibility with the very large existing code base, rather than adding features of dubious value, doing nothing to address the GIL problem, and breaking compatibility with the vast majority of 2.X code. While this is certainly my opinion, and yours obviously differs, you can't badger away the limitations of the GIL, and you can't just browbeat people into accepting the 3.X series as a good thing.<p>Look, I don't hate the language -- I use it every day and like it a lot. But don't pretend that there aren't real problems with Python when there clearly are -- the discussions on bugs.python.org are mainly driven by strong proponents of the language and are hardly politicized -- and don't pretend that Python 3 wasn't problematic; it's created years -- yes, years -- of problems and confusion with 2 vs 3 incompatibility, has expanded the footprint of the language and changed its semantics in substantive ways (cf. the many, many accepted PEPs post 2.X) that make implementing the language harder. Every language bump (whether 2.5 to 2.6 or 2.7 to 3.0) has meant additional work for the developers of alternative implementations; this is obvious on the face of it; you need only read these projects' blogs and look at the elapsed calendar time.",1340816606

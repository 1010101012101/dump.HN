I challenge you to find a single one that requires you pay for the arbitration process in all but frivolous cases.<p>Let&#x27;s take Amazon&#x27;s:\n&quot;Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#x27;s rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys&#x27; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions,&quot;<p>Paypal goes further, in fact:\n&quot;If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PayPal will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive&quot;<p>NACA&#x27;s next complaint is that you don&#x27;t get an in-person hearing, but at the same time complains about the expense of <i>arbitration</i>?\nThis is non-sensical.<p>Naca also makes some more falsehoods:\n&quot;Forced arbitration clauses generally bind the consumer—not the company. The way many forced arbitration clauses are written, the seller retains its rights to take any complaint to court while the consumer can only initiate arbitration.\n&quot;\nAgain, i&#x27;ve yet to see any of these. Amazon&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t.<p>Maybe paypal, that bastion of horribleness, says something here:\n&quot; You and PayPal each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PayPal shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.&quot;<p>Whoops, nope, they agree to arbitration bilaterally too\n(they also agree to pay the fees)<p>They cite exactly <i>zero</i> examples of any of these claims, btw.<p>Part of my life is reviewing TOS&#x27;en, and i&#x27;ve got to have reviewed thousands. I have not seen <i>any</i> that are either unilateral, or where you would pay fees.  All I ask is for one example :)<p>I also doubt such a thing would be upheld even under current supreme court precedent.<p>The rest of the NACA complaints basically come down &quot;you can&#x27;t take them to court&quot;. Which is yes, the point of arbitration.\nTo avoid the cost of court.<p>The truth is, NACA doesn&#x27;t like arbitration because the lawyers involved in it are class action lawyers.\nShocking.",1398473945

At age 50, participants were also tested in terms of cognitive functioning, social relationships, as well as for general levels of well-being (these were assessed using standard scales).<p>What the researchers found was that, even after accounting for things like IQ and socioeconomic status at the beginning of the study, bullying appears to have a significant impact on people’s lives for decades after the bullying has finished.&quot;",1398471988

This is a sure sign of USB&#x27;s technical failure. Which isn&#x27;t to say that USB won&#x27;t thrive.<p>Here&#x27;s my thought about those chips. I do a lot of simple prototyping, testing, data acquisition, and so forth. To these ends, I often build my own little gadgets that combine some sort of microcontroller with some analog electronics, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t be insulted if you called me a hobbyist. Still, the stuff that I make works, and solves problems.<p>There are &quot;USB microcontrollers&quot; that contain a built-in USB port. Then you have to wade through each manufacturer&#x27;s peculiar documentation, and hope that their demo code does what you need, or prepare to roll your own on both the embedded and desktop sides.<p>Or, you hook up a USB-to-serial bridge. There&#x27;s nothing magic about serial, except that it only robs you of two pins, and setting it up is 100x easier. Also, the bridge chip runs independently, making it 100x easier to write real time code on the microcontroller.<p>If I went to any other kind of interface, I&#x27;d use the same approach of a &quot;bridge&quot; module plus a microcontroller. There are such modules for virtually every conceivable interface.<p>I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of watching my gadgets work on multiple platforms with no extra effort on my part. I think a platform needs to have at least one &quot;people&#x27;s port&quot; and the FTDI chip meets that need nicely.",1398471310

We have a specific logged Hipchat channels -- but the rest just keep 75 lines for context and that is it.  We also never have logged (nor ever will) the 1 on 1 conversations.  Employees in a physical location can go outside and rant about a boss, family issue or other random noise -- and this isn&#x27;t unhealthy, it is normal.  We want to encourage open communication and straightforwardness -- and having communications &quot;forgotten&quot; is an important part of that.  It also had additional benefits.<p>1. It limits the nightmare of discovery if we ever get sued, ever word every employee ever said won&#x27;t be painstakingly scrutinized.

The timing and intensity of light relative to when your internal clock thinks it is in the day determines the amount of slowing or lengthening of your cycle. So bright light during when your body thinks it is &#x27;morning&#x27; will slow down the cycle, and bright light at &#x27;night&#x27; will lengthen it. That&#x27;s why many people use f.lux. But how much, how long?<p>Your cycle&#x27;s natural free-running cycle length (without zeitgebers, or cues, to entrain it) appears to be determined by genetic factors. This is hard to measure without doing some tracking and, ideally, actually free-running.

The act of running causes you to increase your rain exposure, so unless I'm missing something, at some point the ""exposure time"" will become long enough that the act of running is rendered ineffective, and then actually becomes worse. (For example, if you ran around in a circle for a set time, instead of from point to point).<p>Like I said, I do get that by that point it may not functionally matter, and that if you ran from your car to the store you will not be as wet as if you walked, but it is important to understand the subtleties in order to properly understand why.",1243018498

The study mentions the availability of cheap hand-tools as one of the reasons.  Similar to cheap hand-tools, it mentions, the availability of a computer in everyone's home has permitted cheap video editing, sound editing, and almost priceless transfer of videos/music, but the study doesn't go into too much depth regarding other applications of cheap computers/internet.  Obviously the existence of the internet and the many cheap businesses which have been started using it as a medium of distribution are testament to the applications of dispersed manufacturing (or hacking).<p>The study mentions that manufacturing will continue its trend of becoming available to even more people than it is now, but that centers for development such as a community manufacturing center would still most likely develop.<p>My questions are as follows:<p>In what ways do you think the internet will continue to disperse and converge?<p>Which technologies are still out of reach to most people in terms of price or required technological know-how?<p>What is the optimal size for hackers to be able to effectively collaborate but not be bogged down by excessive control?",1243017644

Chinese has an iconic lexicon where each glyph is a single word.  Both Cantonese and Mandarin speakers both use the same lexicon, but have different pronunciations.  There are several lexicons (pinyin, big5, ancient) and thousands of glyphs in each.<p>Japanese has three lexicons; hiragana, katagana, and kanji.  Kanji is the oldest and adapted from Chinese.  Glyphs are iconic.  Hiragana and katagana were developed in Japan and are phonetic.  Together they form most of what you see as Japanese text today.  I think katagana is used more for foreign, non-Chinese words.  There is also romanji which is essentially English letters.  Anyway, apart from kanji which is Chinese, there are less than 100 hiragana and katagana glyphs.<p>Korean is even simpler.  They too borrowed from the Chinese and occasionally still use some Chinese glyphs, but the official lexicon is Hangul.  Hangul is phonetic and has 24(?) basic glyphs.  Some glyphs can be combined into compound glyphs called double consonants and double vowels making about 40 glyphs total.  A Korean word can be written by breaking it down into syllables, combining glyphs to form a syllable super-glyph, then putting those together to form a word.<p>The explanation of unicode and python3 is great.

UX is about process which means it's about navigating politics and procuring buy-in and being able to communicate across a broad range of cultures.<p>If you're the only one championing the message of usability & design, then you might get some limited short term success but you will inevitably leave and things will decay back into the ground state.<p>Instead, the correct goal for a UX person should be to instill a culture of usability within a company and act as a facilitator for the people who are building the products.<p>University HCI courses emphasize the technical skills almost exclusively because that's what they're good at but what they end up doing is graduating a bunch of bright, talented people who unfortunately don't have the temperament to play the office politics necessary.",1243016122

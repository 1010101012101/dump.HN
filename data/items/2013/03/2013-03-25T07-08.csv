5435922,comment,5435510,5435510,2,0,argonaut,,,"It seems exceedingly obvious to me that you should leave. Which makes me wonder in the first place why you are even being hesitant about this decision.<p>1. You should not feel bad about anything. They could fire you at any time (assuming control is split equally among the three of you). You do not owe them anything. As long as you're respectful in telling them you're leaving, there is nothing wrong with quitting.<p>2. That being said, I also believe that you're a bit misguided about the best direction for a startup at this stage. I disagree that it is smarter to focus on developing an audience instead of building the product. In order to build an audience you at least need an MVP to show to potential customers/users. Your slow audience growth numbers are easily explained by the lack of a minimally fleshed-out product. You are not going to see huge numbers for a landing page. And many products require some sort of education  / early adoption before they get mass traction. Speaking for myself, if I see a landing page I'm not going to even bother putting in my email on the invite list. I'd like to see a demo at the very least. The fact that you guys don't have an MVP after two months is a bit of a concern for me. I'm not sure how much responsibility you bear for that. This point is irrelevant as to your decision on whether you should leave, but it's something for you to reflect on if you ever want to start another company (by yourself, with others, etc.).",1364198336

Application with the content provides a way to open the document interaction controller with reference to the document, iOS supplies icons of apps that can open it, user selects app and it opens with a different launch options so it opens the content directly.<p>There is nothing more fine-grained than file-type but mime-types, win32 registry keys, etc have always just been conventions really outside of a few well-known types.  BFS (beos) tried to add in metadata attributes to the filesystem and it was pretty slick, admittedly.<p>I guess I can kind of see the complaint about wasting space on duplicates but if one app is a viewer, and the other is an editor... well I think the OP comment is kind or obtuse.

Yes, the author touches on some uncomfortable topics. Yes, I can see how someone might find certain arguments upsetting, or even offensive. At the very least, not everyone will agree with every point Wittens makes.<p>But the take-away, at least for me, was how vast the grey area is between the ""sides"" of these topics, and also how much of what we perceive (about people, sexism, and the tech industry as a whole) happens within a bubble. That there are a ton of related and important issues in the wider context, which fail to get addressed when the discussions are so narrow in scope.<p>There are plenty of other take-aways too, and perhaps I'm missing something that someone else will point out, but overall I found this piece really refreshing, especially after a the other discussions I've read lately, on HN and elsewhere.<p>------------<p>Note: I originally responded on this link, which is now dead:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5434142"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5434142</a>",1364195646

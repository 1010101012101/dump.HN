6913406,comment,6906529,6909401,1,0,jsteemann,,,"Yes, AQL was inspired by XQuery.<p>I think SQL is really good for querying relational databases.<p>Actually we started with implementing something like SQL&#x27;s SELECT clause in the very beginning of ArangoDB. The rationale was: &quot;why invent another language? SQL is everyhwere, so let&#x27;s use it!&quot;.<p>We very soon found that SQL is not a good fit for working with semi-structured data. There is no definite schema for a collection in ArangoDB, so it is unknown which attributes (think: columns) a document (think: row) will have. Thus using standard SQL would have introduced a lot of potential ambiguities. Example:<p><pre><code>    SELECT a, b, c \n    FROM c1 \n    INNER JOIN c2 \n    ON (c1.x = c2.y)\n</code></pre>\nWhen inspecting the above query initially, the database has no idea if attribute &quot;a&quot; will come from c1 or c2. Each document in both collections can have an attribute &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; or none at all. So a query like the above could throw an ambiguity error at runtime only, and not at query compile time. Fully qualifying attributes with &quot;table&quot; names would have worked (e.g. &quot;SELECT c1.a&quot;), but would be a deviation from standard SQL, which doesn&#x27;t require that. And then people would have asked &quot;they claim to support SQL. But why doesn&#x27;t my SQL statement work in ArangoDB?&quot;. Probably a lot of confusion.<p>Apart from that, it is common to have multi-valued attributes in document databases (and thus in ArangoDB). Think of an attribute which itself is a list.<p>SQL really is not designed for this. Putting a horizontal lists into a single attribute/column is an anti-pattern in the relational world. Instead, you would normalize most data into separate n:m mapping tables etc., and join them later.<p>No need to do this with a document database: horizontal lists are supported, and there is less NEED for normalization. It is up to you how to model the data.<p>With all that in mind, we very soon switched to a language we thought would better fit a non-relational database such as ArangoDB. \nWe intentionally decided against using SQL keywords, to avoid confusion.<p>I hope the decision for starting AQL now is little more comprehensible.",1387180024

What does it take to keep a person alive?<p>3. What does it take to keep a person conscious?<p>4. What does it take to keep a person in control of his mind?<p>5. What does it take to keep a person in control of his body?<p>6. What does it take to keep a person happy?<p>We need to answer to all of them, in the right order. The answer to every question is necessary for the next.<p>0. It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me, as it&#x27;s not something that requires maintenance. I either exist or I don&#x27;t. It looks like I exist, so this question will never matter to me (assuming I&#x27;m selfish and others don&#x27;t have to exist).<p>1. I prefer my body to be preserved than not. Hopefully, we will reach the point where I can be revived.<p>2. Being alive is nice and all, but it&#x27;s not pretty exciting. Want to be in a coma all your life? Probably not. Still, it&#x27;s easier with current technologies to bring consciousness to someone in a coma than to bring life to a dead &quot;preserved&quot; body.<p>3. Now you&#x27;re talking. I like being conscious. Without it, it&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t even exist. But passively feeling the world has its limits.<p>4. Control of my mind changes everything. I&#x27;m no longer limited by the external world, I can imagine my own. However, this also brings the ability to suffer, which I don&#x27;t believe is present with consciousness alone (a world in which there&#x27;s no good or bad). In that state, The Matrix would be enough to entertain me for a while. Unless it&#x27;s not.<p>5. Well, now I can actually change how the world works. Sure, you could argue that I already could when I was able to communicate with The Matrix, and you would be right. But I make a distinction here, just because. At this point, you have some control over the above, and you can actually be in control of your fate, life and future. This is probably where you reach a point where you start automating the above conditions, and build the infrastructure to keep you alive/conscious/active/etc.<p>6. Now that&#x27;s the hard question. To exist, to be alive, to be conscious, it&#x27;s not really subjective. Most people would agree about what it takes for these conditions to be met. But happiness, that&#x27;s a hard one. Excluding all of the above from the scope of happiness might help. Being healthy, conscious, able to think, are all necessary for happiness to ever be considered, so we don&#x27;t have to think about them. We must think about art, love, family, etc. These are all things that are not necessary to exist, being alive, being conscious, having control over his body, etc. Why do we need them? Why can&#x27;t we be happy once 1-5 are fulfilled? Is there a need to reproduce, as a backup in the case that the system fails and people cease to exist? Are we more happy when we&#x27;re more people? Are we more happy when we have more resources to maintain the conditions above? Should we measure happiness as the predicted time left to live? Is living in 2013 worth less than living in 2020 (in which case, it would make sense to cryogenize someone and defrost/revive him in the future)? Don&#x27;t we do it because it&#x27;s too risky (we still don&#x27;t know what might happen when we lose control)? Is loss of control the main fear we have?<p>I want to live in a world where 1-5 are taken care of. They&#x27;re objective conditions, they don&#x27;t change from person to person. At this point, we will be able to reflect on life, and build a future where we can be truly happy. If that&#x27;s possible.",1387179448

Agriculture is too mechanized and there are no longer very many family farmers and precious few peasants.<p>But in Russia, things are different. Hundreds of thousands of people still live a subsistence lifestyle with minimal access to technology. There are many people who have gone off into the woods somewhere actively escaping civilization, and most of these people are still peasants, in other words they still have the skills and capabilities to survive on their own even in the harsh climate of Russia.<p>China is too dependent on large river valleys where the big cities are located, but at least some of the agricultural land is far enough away from cities that people would survive, and they too are close to peasant levels of subsistence lifestyle.<p>So a nuclear war would destroy the United States, but Russia as a state would be back within one generation.

So, how do you explain Java&#x27;s flavor of OOP — which is necessary to explain why Java does certain things that would otherwise seem like arbitrary invocations — without explaining OOP at least in part?

Their thinking is that they&#x27;re like an &quot;anti-virus&quot;, and they can protect everyone if you just let them <i>infiltrate everything</i>.<p>They&#x27;ve had this thinking since at least 2010 when I saw them talking about it in a public debate with Bruce Schneier, but probably much earlier, since it already seemed like a planned thing. Unsurprisingly perhaps, it came soon after US Cyber Command was formed, and then merged with the NSA. That&#x27;s when this corrupted idea (probably from Keith Alexander himself) started emerging, and why it&#x27;s so dangerous to keep them merged (something Obama keeps defending, even after his own non-independent review panel suggested him to separate the two).<p>So their idea of security, isn&#x27;t actually having secure systems (anymore?!), but for them to have backdoors into everything, which of course is nonsense, and they are creating more problems than solving. But for all we know that&#x27;s exactly how they like it, much like the war on terror, which keeps being prolonged by creating more terrorists, and keeping the Military Industrial Complex well fed and profitable.<p>Or they think all the data they are collecting about the whole world is well worth risking having compromised systems, even at home, but they present the idea of themselves having to do this to &quot;protect Americans&quot; as a lie to cover for that, and because they know it sounds better to the public and (some) politicians.",1387177475

It seems to help to fully update the system doing &quot;upgrade&quot; before &quot;doing the upgrade&quot; (dist-upgrade) that will uninstall things... That said, it can obviously be a bit of a waste to upgrade everything like gnome just to uninstall it immediately... As such, I typically manually uninstall large tasks then upgrade then dist-upgrade and manually add the tasks back. In &quot;theory&quot; it should just be as you say  - one big dist-upgrade - but I&#x27;ve yet to encounter an upgrade that didn&#x27;t need special attention and I have learned that minimizing the installed base being upgraded is a good first step to a smooth transition.",1387177408

Of course it is always hard to figure out the actual intent of a shooter when the event ends in the shooter&#x27;s death, but the possibility of a connection really makes one wonder if suicide prevention activities would also have an impact on school shootings.<p>Although most of the news coverage of school shootings goes to events in the USA, they do happen in other countries and some of those countries might be more willing than the USA, to improve suicide prevention activities, and to include school shootings in their measure of effectiveness. It might take a few decades to gather enough data to be sure of whether or not it works, but long term experiments are still valuable and we need to do more of them.",1387177201

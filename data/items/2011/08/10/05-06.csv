Using 8.8.8.8 may cause CDNs to potentially direct you to a node that's nowhere near your actual physical location<p>2) Aggregate traffic on a node. The more people using 8.8.8.8 for DNS, the more people who may land on the CDN nodes associated with 8.8.8.8's location and thus that node may be more loaded than the one closer to you<p>[edit] Google even covers this in their Public DNS FAQ: <a href=""http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq.html#cdn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq.html#cdn</a>.

I usually look at big things like this in terms of where the money's going. But in the context of 'get unwitting customers to show up for free coffee when there's no money on a viral marketing gift card so that they'll spend money anyway', I'd ask 'where's the credit going' -- and no one at Starbucks corporate will claim creating a sleazy confidence game for some career leverage.

It's the fastest and easiest option, (perhaps the website admin isn't available) and excising the Starbucks logo alone would look awfully suspicious.

Anecdotally, I know that many of our newer customers did watch the video and found it helpful in understanding our product.<p>We also use Olark chat on our site, which besides giving us the ability to chat with our customers easily online, we can see what pages the customers are visiting in real-time, during our chat.  I've chatted with scores of customers this way, and it's typical for most every user to jump all around the site to get a good feel for 'how it works', 'what it does' and 'how much does it cost'.  It's helpful if you have an obvious ""sign up"" link incorporated on every single page of your website, so no matter where on your site a customer decides they want in, they can do so easily.<p>I can say that adding that video did not hurt conversion, but it also didn't substantially increase conversions either.

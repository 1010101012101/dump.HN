10993187,comment,10991729,10992191,0,0,nodamage,,,"A few more thoughts:<p>1. This effectively poisons the well for any other BaaS providers out there. If two of the biggest companies in this space (StackMob and Parse) can get acquired and shut down in less than 5 years, what does that say about the future of the smaller companies in this space? As a developer how could you possibly trust any of these companies going forward, based on this track record?<p>2. Syncing is notoriously difficult to get right. Building a generalized syncing solution is <i>even harder</i>. Bugs in sync code tend to lead to data loss, which leads to angry customers. These types of bugs are hard enough to track down and fix in your own code. Trying to track down and fix bugs in complex third-party code can be damn near impossible.<p>If you decide to adopt a third party solution that purports to do your syncing for you, do your research carefully. Not just by looking at the toy samples which look easy to set up and work perfectly, but experiences and reports from actual developers who have tried such solutions. What kind of problems are they having? What are the limitations of the current implementation? How mature is the product? How responsive are they to bug reports? If something goes wrong and data is lost, how much insight do you have into the system to figure out why?",1454036059
10993186,comment,10991434,10992682,0,0,dllthomas,,,"I&#x27;m not sure which of the two cases you&#x27;re addressing; I&#x27;ll respond with one comment assuming each.<p>If you are talking about case 2 (fixed UBI, fixed tax rate, making up the difference - when there is one - by printing money or borrowing), then when one individual stops working the UBI payment does not decrease.  If productivity falls when that worker stops working (presumably the case for most workers), then we would expect to eventually see some \ninflation.  It may work out to 1%, with the proper assumptions; I&#x27;m not certain.<p>Still I don&#x27;t see why it follows that <i>&quot;a rational actor would stop working&quot;</i> - some may, but only if they decide the small decrease in UBI <i>and large decrease in earned income</i> is worth it.<p>At sufficiently high UBI level relative to earned income, that&#x27;s pretty likely to be the case.  At sufficiently low UBI level ($1?) that&#x27;s pretty unlikely to be the case.<p>> Similarly, if 95 out of 100 stop working, then the other 5 have little incentive to work, because their income is basically funding everyone else.<p>The same chunk of their income as ever is going directly to fund everyone else.  A bigger portion of their income is being diluted by the money printed to make up the rest of the UBI.  But as the currency devalues, presuming they are doing things people want, they are able to demand more money for their production.  The UBI is diluted toward meaningless.  At some point, other workers decide to get back in the game, because the (nominally constant but really much lower) UBI will not fund the lifestyle they want, slowing the inflating.<p>This is a negative feedback loop.",1454035992

It might help your startup, but at the cost of reputation and goodwill. I could choose to start a company and tell people about it by mentioning it in hundreds of posts on message boards and news aggregators, but even if I contributed intelligent discussion and content along with it, I&#x27;d still likely be downvoted, &quot;thumbs-downed&quot;, and lambasted the vast majority of the time.<p>Mentioning it is fine in some cases, where it&#x27;s actually very pertinent to the discussion (&quot;actually, my startup happens to be solving exactly this problem!&quot; or &quot;for a great example of X, check out <a href=""https://startup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://startup.com</a> [Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a co-founder]&quot;).

Getting well-deserved and organic publicity is much harder.<p>Your post was in response to a minor-ish announcement about a programming language that&#x27;s been around for 4 years, one very similar to the most popular one (JavaScript), and which definitely isn&#x27;t some kind of unicorn or barely-known gem.<p>If you just wanted to show that real people are using TypeScript in production, why couldn&#x27;t you have said &quot;my startup has been successfully using TS for X amount of time and we&#x27;ve been loving it&quot; and nothing more? Anyone who was genuinely interested in what startup it was could look at your other posts, or message you, or click the link from your profile if you had it listed it there. You didn&#x27;t even link to any source code to show people examples of practical TypeScript.<p>The exact startup that&#x27;s using TS doesn&#x27;t matter in respect to the nature of the comment you made. Perhaps if it were something really notable and unexpected, like Twitter or Google suddenly using TS for their frontend, then mentioning the company makes sense. Here, it just seems like shameless self-promotion.<p>As a result of your post, I think a little more highly of TypeScript, but in turn, I also think less of your startup.

Because you know what&#x27;s not conducive to learning? Having no choice as far as subjects; having no choice how long you spend on them; having no choice on who to learn from; having no choice who you learn with.&quot;<p>Most people don&#x27;t really want to choose and if given too many choices, will be overwhelmed and not get anything accomplished.<p>New learners of language, for example, have no idea where to start, which teacher to choose, or which subject they need to learn.<p>I work for myself and I&#x27;ve been working on my current project for over a year.  There were so many times I wanted to give up and so many boring parts, but I slogged through it all, because I know the end result will be a great accomplishment.<p>I&#x27;ve met so many developers that get bored when they have to work on something that has the slightest hint of monotony.  I feel like that&#x27;s one of my greatest assets and I<p>We should encourage discipline when learning..and the method you suggested with 50 minute segments, etc does the exact opposite.<p>Experienced teachers know exactly what someone needs to learn to get to the point where they can learn for themselves.<p>This is what k-12 is all about.  Once you get into college, you most definitely have the choice.<p>There may be students that get to this point faster..which I think is what AP classes are all about.<p>&quot;How much work would most developers get done if they had their day broken into 50 minute segments, five minute transition times, and six different projects they were required to work on every day with equal consistency?&quot;<p>I have no idea about other developers, but for me, not much.  This sounds like a terrible way to develop any project.<p>&quot;PG has a classic essay on makers vs managers on scheduling, and he places emphasis on how for work like programming, getting into the material takes time. I see no reason this wouldn&#x27;t apply to learning.&quot;<p>The mistake here is assuming everyone has the mind of an engineer/software developer.<p>&quot;My mother runs a Montessori preschool. Consistently, the kids that go off to first grade come back with stories of attending traditional school and wondering when they get to start doing something instead of sitting at their desk. Or when they can do something new instead of going through material they already know with the class&quot;<p>Children shouldn&#x27;t be making these decisions.  When I was in school, I hated math.  If given the choice, I would have played video games all day.  Looking back, I&#x27;m glad I was forced to sit and learn all of those math skills that I pretty much use every day.  Part of learning is memorization, which can&#x27;t be skipped.  Another part is having the discipline to do something you don&#x27;t really enjoy, but need to do it to achieve a goal.<p>&quot;It bothers me greatly when someone blames the nature of people for problems that are systemic in nature&quot;<p>Systems are created around human behavior, not vice-versa.  My wife learned in an environment like you envision: lots of choice and very little structured learning.  Since no teacher told her what to study, she now has huge gaps in knowledge that she really has no time to make up as an adult.  I would never want to put a child through that as it depriving them of their future success.<p>&quot;it feels no different from the ridiculous number of ADHD diagnoses we have these days, which seems to largely stem from not giving kids space to be kids.&quot;<p>ADHD is over-diagnosed, but removing the structure from our current education system has nothing to do with it.<p>I also think that we need to teach kids to put down the ipad and phones when they are learning.

People say a lot, and just don&#x27;t know?&quot;(<a href=""http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2015/04/fresno-chief-of-police-accused-of-murdersuicide-cover-up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fresnopeoplesmedia.com/2015/04/fresno-chief-of-police...</a>).<p>And honestly, I expected him to say that there wasn&#x27;t, and that some cops are of course corrupt, but that is just the way things are. You know a canned response. What he said, I&#x27;ll never forget, in paraphrase, &quot;In Fresno, more than anywhere else... well lets just say the police officers here don&#x27;t ever have your best interest in mind.&quot; He then smiles, shook my hand and went on his way.",1454033933

During that time, the house was cleaned spotless, laundry done and folded, even ironed my shirts and hung them (as opposed to my typical pattern of snatching them from the dryer and ironing them immediately before I wear them), and many other things were done that I would have normally procrastinated and waited until the very last minute.

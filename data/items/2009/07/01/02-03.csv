682018,comment,681952,681973,0,0,rs,,,"I came up with the same conclusion a while back for my projects, BUT it only makes sense if there isn't a feature differentiation between the Free and Paid products. If the Paid products do come with compelling features then it will make a lot of sense to have a Trail period as it will give potential paying customers an opportunity to ""test before buying"".<p>Having said that, asking for payment info upfront is generally not a good idea when you have a trail period. But then again, if you do not pick it up, you might get some abusers who won't cough up the dough after the trail period is over.",1246416850

He explicitly says that if he could do it over again, he'd have stopped at the point where he could live comfortably but not extravagantly.<p>I used to wonder how people like Bill Gates could resist walking away once they'd made their first ten billion, and doing something fun or personally fulfilling.  If I were Gates, I'd be living on the Moon and looking through a telescope at Mars.  But upon thinking the question through a little farther, I realized that if Gates were the type to do something like that, he'd never have made that first ten billion in the first place.  He would've quit after his first ten million, without the resources to do anything <i>but</i> live well on Earth with the usual expensive toys.<p>A depressing paradox, when you think about it.",1246416770

682012,comment,681952,681952,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I would offer a cancellation policy within 30 days. The way I see it, there are only two reasons why anyone would get payment information up front.<p>A: To 'trick' people into paying for something they might have decided against buying. (Bad reason)<p>B: To limit people who try to take advantage of unlimited free trials - buy using credit card info as an identifier, you could tell who's already had a free trial and who hasn't (to some extent).<p>If it's for reason A, don't do it. If it's for reason B, do it, but don't charge them until they confirm at the end of 30 days. Send them an email with something like, ""We hope you enjoyed your free trial. If you are happy with the service and would like to continue using it, click here and get a promotional 10% off your next 3 months.""

Chances are good that you won't want to live through such a time.<p>Think about it.  It takes time and money to commoditize any new technology; wealthy early adopters are often required to help the technology evolve to the point where it's ready for the masses.  Remember when only the ""rich"" had phones in their cars?

681965,comment,681503,681636,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"I like _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_ by Michael Feathers. It's a collection of techniques for bootstrapping tests into an existing code base - carefully, incrementally restructuring the code to add enough tests to safely perform deeper structural changes. At the same time, it's ultimately a book about improving legacy codebases (testing is just a major technique), so it focuses on using testing when it's most useful.<p>(Also, maybe it's just me, but a book that starts from, ""Help! I just inherited a C++ project with ten years of rot and half the comments are in Norwegian! How do I even start adding tests to this without breaking it further?"" seems a bit more practical than one that starts by applying unit tests to example code designed for convenient testing. It's seldom that easy.)",1246413609

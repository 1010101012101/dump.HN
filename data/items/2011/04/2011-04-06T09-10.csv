(1 out of 6 persons, currently more than 60 percent of peoples around me own an iPhone). I'm not aware of any gift-giving holiday (and I'm french). The only reason I can come up with is that the internet/connected french community is very strong, hence knowledge such as ""this app is awesome and free"" can spread very fast.<p>I just looked at the user's review on the appstore, and the rating is very high. There's even 5 stars with comments like: When will the french version be available? (It was written in french. I did the translation)<p>There's no french interface and It doesn't seem to really bother users, it could be a plus though.",1302083764
2414505,comment,2414491,2414491,10,0,mihar,,,"Here's some background:<p>When developing new advertisement format, our team did a lot of data-mining and A/B testing to reveal unknown patterns in human behaviour. One of the patterns was that, if you put random badges on the edge of the screen, people will tend to click on them out of curiosity. If you put more coupons, theyll click even more. And if you show them coupons only once in a while, the time pressure will make users click even more.<p>The resulting CTRs were dwarfing any other means of advertising. But beware, this behaviour only lasted as long as there were good deals hidden under coupon badges. Changing good deals to no deals would decrease coupon CTR for a whole site for weeks.<p>With promising CTR results, we wanted even more milk from a coupon, so we implemented a form for collecting emails for newsletter. The number of collected emails has again exceeded all expectations of our client.
And, as if this is not enough good news from our tingling little coupon, niche and local websites are also reporting good physical conversion, meaning: people showing up in the stores with printed coupons.<p>So what is happening here?<p>A lot of curiosity and a big pull. Coupon badges basically generate a pull relationship with a customer, who is then more likely to engage with a coupon content.<p>Since all this sounds like a mouth-full and we cant tell you exact statistics and our case studies, we give you popify.me<p>popify.me is the simplest version of coupons that you can test on your site and see it for yourself. Youll prepare a coupon and put it on your site in a minute. Theres also a viral loop included for social media spread and some sweet statistics.",1302083754

2414503,comment,2414280,2414280,15,0,nikcub,,,"I am also self-taught, although I dropped out of University two years into a CompSci/Engineering double major, so I will recommend some resources to you that helped me immensely. Each of these books has an associated MIT course with lecture video, notes, etc. available online.<p>First is Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs[1], which you can read online, and the associated course at MIT, which is 6.001[2]<p>Second is the famous 'Dragon Book', Compilers: Principals, Techniques and Tools[3] and the associated course which is 6.035[4]<p>Extras would be the Python book 'How to think like a Computer Scientist'[5]. MIT course 6.00[6] uses the book as a reference, and the courseware is again available online.<p>Other than that - the usual suspects on learning C (K&R), UNIX (TAOUP[7]), the bash shell along with grep, sed, awk, more algorithms(CLRS[8]), functional programming and machine learning. Take your time, it takes years to build the relevant experience and knowledge and you are never done.<p>I love the MIT courses. Work and learn at your own rate. I feel that it is important to implement all the code yourself even if it looks easy in a lecture - there are little things you pick up as you write algorithms out.<p>Even though I had worked through SICP I still watched all the lectures again and implemented all the examples with benchmarks and unit tests. I usually set aside one day on the weekend to work on study, and usually an extra evening or two mid-week to read papers and books. Once you get into the routine it is great.<p>It might be the best approach to set yourself a timetable and weekly schedule, just like in UNI (ie. every Saturday plus Tuesday and Thursday nights) and work through the MIT courseware and associated books in order (6.00, 6.001, 6.035). The more advanced MIT courseware is an excellent bonus.<p>[1] <a href=""http://xrl.us/sicp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/sicp</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://xrl.us/6001"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/6001</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://xrl.us/dragonbook"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/dragonbook</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://xrl.us/6035"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/6035</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://xrl.us/thinkcs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/thinkcs</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://xrl.us/6000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/6000</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://xrl.us/artunix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/artunix</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://xrl.us/clrs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xrl.us/clrs</a>",1302083730

I would say that the admission standards here in India are very rigid , going by the top two engineering entrance exams. For IITs 4k out of 150k people who write the exam get admissions whereas for the RECS and some second tier colleges the admission rate was around 15-20%. Hence i think the problem is not that the admission standards are lax. 
What the wsj article was hinting at a lack of basic comprehension and technical skills. Lack of comprehension skills(in English) can be explained by the fact that English is not the first language ,even though it may be the medium of instruction. 
The other weakness has a lot to do with lack of interest, motivation and also a sense of lethargy which sets in after going through two years of what can best be described as a bootcamp preparing for the engineering entrance exams.",1302082489

You start to spot the cases where this is not immediately obvious after some FP practice.<p>- After learning logics programming, I realized how much of my programs do a poor man's version of backtracking.<p>Maybe one of those languages is so much fun that you'll eventually change your 'lifestyle'. E.g. I use Haskell in many cases where I'd previously use Python or C.<p>[1] Of course, it doesn't always come natural. C++ STL does provide maps and folds, but since pre-C++0x doesn't have lambdas, using them requires more effort.",1302081638

United States, 395 U.S. 285 (1969)'') and that DP knew this the whole point of the new scheme was to continue segregation.<p>More here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co</a>.

Then set the grid to 1px X 1px (in some unobtrusive color) When creating a new doc, always go to view / (check) snap to grid / then whenever making a sprite simply put everything together, and draw a rectangle around it. With the rectangle still selected, make sure its height and width are in even pixels, and Go to object / artboards / convert to artboard. Hit save for web, and you are done! (hint, make sure strokes are always set to inside, or outside, and never centered, adobe defaults to center, so creating some reusable graphic styles can make this quicker)

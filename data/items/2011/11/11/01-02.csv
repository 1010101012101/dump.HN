3222966,comment,3220819,3221030,87,0,grellas,,,"What Zynga is doing is pretty repulsive, as I previously commented in a related thread (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3219437"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3219437</a>), but it is not accurate to say that ""[t]hey have to fire you for cause for you to lose your options.""<p>The overwhelming majority of employees at startups sign documentation acknowledging that their employment is at will and can be terminated at any time by either party for any reason, with or without cause. In relatively rare cases involving founders or high-placed executives, the company will sign contracts stating that, though the employment is at-will (i.e., can be terminated at any time for any reason without liability), the employee will get accelerated vesting of one sort or another in the event of a termination ""without cause"" or a resignation for ""good reason."" ""Cause"" is usually defined as willful failure or refusal to perform duties that continues after notice and an opportunity to cure, misappropriation or misuse of company trade secrets, commission of a felony or other action involving moral turpitude, etc. and ""good reason"" is typically defined as material reduction in compensation or duties, relocation to a remote area, etc. If you have an employment agreement that provides for such acceleration, then you are clearly protected against the Zynga-style threats described in this piece. If you do not, then you generally are <i>not</i> on firm legal footing but still may have some fighting chances.<p>What are those? If you can argue that an otherwise permissible at-will firing becomes impermissible because it is animated by discriminatory animus (race, sex, age, etc.), and you belong to a protected class, you could argue that the threatened firing is illegal and would subject the company to damages (which, of course, would include the value of the unvested stock that would otherwise have vested had the company not acted illegally to terminate your employment).<p>If you can argue that the ground of termination violates public policy, this might be a separate basis for claiming that the firing is illegal, notwithstanding that the employment relationship is at-will.<p>If you can argue that the company has given you implied promises that your employment would be for a certain duration, this also might take it out of the at-will category and give you fighting chances.<p>If you can argue that you were induced by fraudulent misrepresentations, e.g., to leave an existing employment based on the promise of equity compensation, or if the at-will language in your agreement is defectively implemented, or if any other ground might exist by which you can legally claim you got cheated or had some promise made to you breached, all this too can take this out of the pure at-will category as well and give you a basis for leverage.<p>To sum up, ""cause"" is not usually needed by an employer to terminate employment and recapture unvested equity. But you also by no means automatically lose just because your employment is at will. This is a complex area. With a lot at stake, it pays to get good legal advice to see if you can find a good angle by which to protect yourself.<p>A good legal case depends on legal rules that support it and, even more important, on good facts that motivate judges, juries, and anyone else looking at the case to <i>want</i> to go in a certain direction. Here, Zynga is providing all the good facts an employee needs to motivate people to want to slap them upside the head. That by itself is not enough. But if you find even one legal hook that gives you a sound basis upon which to attack what they are doing, then you can stand and fight. It is not easy, but sometimes you have no choice.",1320975978

Furthermore, if you hire someone whose skills become unnecessary, you just lay them off. You don't keep them on board and try to renegotiate them down to a lesser compensation.<p>Here's another analogous scenario: Imagine that you are hired under a contract that says ""We don't have the cash on hand today to pay you full market rate today, so we're going to pay you $X per month (which is significantly below market rate), plus $250k bonus at the end of each full year that you're working for us, up to $1m over 4 years, assuming the company lasts that long"".

Normally an early employee's 4 years are up way before a company is worth billions of dollars. Even in the last year or two of a 4-year option plan, the employer's implicit choice is ""is it worth another .1% for me to keep this person for one more year?"", and .1% might be worth 20k or even 50k, and so the employer doesn't even consider ways of reducing that cost because it's tiny compared to the early employee's value.

No options, no nothing. Same would go for an individual who retired while still at the office. They're a cancer and you can't keep them around. I cannot see these types of people being reassigned. Oddly enough, some of those people are actually kept around, but that's another story.<p>But in the case of someone who was promoted to a level of responsibility beyond their capabilities, after working at the company for some time, I could see management clawing back those options and benefits given to them in addition to the ones they were originally at the time of their initial employment.<p>However, and if I'm understanding what is being written about Mr. Pincus, going after those options deemed excessive which were granted to early employees for the sole purpose of not having them participate in an equitable share of the profits of a stock sale, well, that's fraud.

3222857,comment,3221211,3221211,1,0,dylangs1030,,,"I don't think Google+ should be trying to compete with Facebook and Twitter in the traditional sense of the word.  Just because a website fits into a niche of companies under the broad heading, ""Social Network"" doesn't mean that it has the same intentions as its other incumbents.  Facebook more or less eradicated MySpace because it was a case of two websites being too similar in function, and Facebook was simply superior.  Twitter and Facebook coexist without one or the other being eliminated because they don't directly compete - Twitter is useful for different functions that Facebook doesn't accomplish; but neither does Facebook or Twitter <i>try</i> to accomplish the other's specialties.  While I agree that some competition is needed to expand user base and continually maintain attractive and trending features, it would be better for the social networks to specialize.  A website like Facebook could never defeat Facebook - it has a de facto monopoly on vicarious, virtual socializing.<p>That said, you don't really go on Facebook to announce something to the world unless you have a really popular ""Page"" (as opposed to profile).  You sign up for Twitter and tell your followers what the update is.  It's much more professional for a working environment.  Facebook is personal.  I feel Google+ fits somewhere in between these two dichotomies right now, which is why it feels somewhat awkward for a lot of users.  But I think it's still a very good network that has potential to specialize into something neither Facebook or Twitter quite accomplish yet.  If it can create its own niche within a niche, competition won't be as important as maintaining its own superlative market share for specialized functioning.  Otherwise, it will die out, because directly competing with Facebook will <i>not</i> work at this point in time.",1320974018

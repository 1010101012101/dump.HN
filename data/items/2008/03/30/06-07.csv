In my book, dogs have personalities.<p>Still, rather than about personality I was talking about basic pulsions, namely those directly related to survival and reproduction.<p>Contrary to rms, I easily concede that ideas are faster to <i>fill</i> survival needs. But where do those needs come from? Why do we care about surviving, as individuals and as a species? We wouldn't ever have put our minds to work on the problem of survival if the visceral will for survival wasn't already there.<p>I argued that our genetic conditionings related to sexual selection persist because our genes haven't had time to 'learn' their increasing irrelevance. The slowness of genetic adaptation is an argument in favor, not against, the prevalence of genetic heritage as a factor (certainly not the only one) in our drives and personalities.",1206860346

My point remains the same: it's a belief either way.

149937,comment,149271,149807,0,0,vlad,,,"Cool.  Congrats!  So, once again, you're missing Startup School. :/<p>I saw a few problems with auctomatic.  Number one, I was never sure how this would work out considering eBay PowerSellers, your target market, would almost entirely be in their 40's, with auctomatic's team below drinking age.  When I was 22, I enjoyed having customers 30-50 years old relying on me for my eBay software, but at 24, after Startup School, I realized that it was okay to be around, as well as to design, new software for people my age--and maybe you were beginning to feel that same way, as well.  (Just like the Beatles could have probably tried to make more money by  targeting older adults of their parents' age since an average teenager doesn't have nearly as much money as a 40 year old; yet, the Beatles became famous by creating music that was great for their own peers at the time.)<p>The other problem I found with eBay is that a startup based around another company's technology and users, at it's best, is tied down to another company, and eBay is not the most technically advanced, consistent, or stable parent to deal with (in my experience) even if they were one of the first web apps to come out with an API.<p>My third worry was that I believed that it would be better to do something for free to attract tons of buyers, and then convert them to sellers, than vice versa, because sellers will go to where the buyers are, from the tons of research I did, and not vice versa.  That's why I concentrated on software for buyers this entire time.<p>The fourth is that such a startup targeting older adults would need to have older employees targeting forums where such sellers hang out, and I'm not sure any of that was being done other than visiting the eBay's annual conference.  I believed you were focusing on creating killer technology and getting funding, but not the boring stuff like talking to older customers who couldn't care less about technology or social networking, nor did I believe you were asking them to tell their friends, etc, in places where older adults might be.<p>This move seems to make tons of sense.  You're decoupling yourself from a being dependent on another company, you're focusing on the buyer aspect, and between the many different  ""properties"" you may be developing, there are plenty of youthful opportunities like boxing.com and call.com to keep one excited and relative to others our age (just for the psychological benefits.)  Oh, and you get paid as part of the process, and stay with the same great team, too.",1206857465
149936,comment,147710,149928,0,0,gruseom,,,"At this point I can only appeal back to what I already said: it depends on whether or not <i>there's an algorithm for everything</i>. If this is true, then sure: assuming enough processing power (and programming power), anything can be simulated. And if it's <i>not</i> true, well, it follows that there's a hard limit, Ã  la your speed-of-light analogy, to what computers will ever be capable of. Doesn't it?<p>How is that a strong claim? I don't state that the ""algorithms for everything"" thesis is true or false, because I don't know. Nobody does. My point is that singularianism depends on a belief about this; a belief that is, based on what we currently know, rather miraculous, and therefore not very hard to dispute.<p>Thanks, by the way, for quoting me as saying ""<i>may</i> be"". I was starting to doubt my ability to get my point across!",1206857379
149935,comment,148773,149289,0,0,euccastro,,,">> We just are what we are.<p>><p>> You can only play to win if you have some control<p>> over your life. If you do, then you aren't just what<p>> you are now.<p>Yes, for all practical purposes I assume you have much control over your life, not because I'm totally convinced, but because there's no value, for practical matters, in entertaining the alternative.<p>I didn't mean that we can't change what we are. We definitely have power to make changes in the cultural (and chemical) part of ourselves, which is a big part of what we are. But where does the motivation to do so come from? It ultimately boils down to the same old pulsions.<p>Now here's a similar, but subtly more puzzling question: imagine some day science enables us to meaningfully overwrite our genetic conditionings so we can control all we feel and desire, from hypothalamus to cortex. Our psyche could become something totally alien to humanity.<p>Now, what would drive our desire to reflash our EPROM in this way?<p>I can think of a couple motivations similar to the ones that lead people to experiment with drugs: escapism and curiosity. Or, from a rationalist perspective, we might choose to get rid of inconvenient desires so we could more wholeheartedly pursue whatever ideals have emerged in our consciousness. For example, we might renounce sex and love without regret, and feel, say, the pleasure of acquisition of knowledge with the same intense visceral passion.<p>So it's plausible that even sane, already happy people see this transformation as desirable.<p>But this brings an interesting bootstrapping question. What we are doing is changing the ""coordinate system"" that we use to evaluate the desirability of stuff. According to what ""desirability coordinate system"" do we compare the old (genetic) one with the new (reflashed) one? Obviously, it has to be according to the old one, since that is what we have at the time the change is considered.<p>What does it even mean that one value basis favors substituting itself by a different one?? It recalls Nietzschean thoughts: that our minds, societies and cultures are battlefields for the struggle between competing values/ideas/memes, and that our very nature is aiming to become something else.<p>My initial point was that there was no absolute coordinate system that allowed different coordinate systems to be compared for desirability. I still believe this, but I no longer have such a nihilistic reaction to it.<p>Back to the point, I think for most people going against the grain of their instincts will be more a cause of suffering (even if it's more evenly distributed through their lifetime) and deathbed regrets than any particular pain endured in the pursuit of love. Therefore, I think pain avoidance is a weak reason to avoid romance.<p>Then again, I can believe there are people who are genuinely disinterested in romance/sex (Da Vinci and Warhol come to mind). Also, I can understand that some people choose to focus their energy on other things. What I don't believe is that such things are intrinsically more ""important"". It's just how you choose to redefine your game.",1206857271

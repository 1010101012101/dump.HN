There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good answer right now. Web Components appears to be intended to solve that problem, but it isn&#x27;t looking so good in my opinion.<p>I would probably go with a similar approach to reducers in Redux: a simple function that takes a state object and returns some library-agnostic representation of DOM. Of course there is no standard representation of DOM that I know of, but you could just output a plain JS object representing the DOM tree. There are probably many libraries out there offering a way to represent DOM that could easily to plugged into (with a simple wrapper) whatever new DOM rendering library is hot.",1451278528

10799937,comment,10799124,10799849,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Parks, libraries and schools are largely not communally-owned spaces, but government-owned. Crucial distinction. In fact, some of the best alternatives to the traditional classroom model (i.e. Montessori, Sudbury, democratic, etc.) tend to be privately run schools. As such, private schools are on the positive side here.<p>Again, this mystical &quot;community&quot; is mostly an illusion. It&#x27;s either private ownership or government ownership via eminent domain. Commons aren&#x27;t applicable in most cases.<p>Bonds with extended family are to be settled on an individual case-by-case basis. Many people rightfully may consider their extended families to be not worth interacting with, and in any event this is all a flimsy normative sentiment.<p>Beauty standards are determined first societally, then by entrepreneurs. The profit motive is intrinsic to a world of uncertainty (see Frank H. Knight&#x27;s <i>Risk, Uncertainty and Profit</i>). It is wholly neutral. There is nothing wrong with pursuing profits, even though a lot of people have an anti-capitalist bias and are convinced it&#x27;s demonic.<p><i>I mostly agree, except in the sense that people are maybe being sold a bad cure for an ailment they might not have had, spending money they don&#x27;t have, perpetuating the problems that caused them to want to escape in the first place.</i><p>Clearly these are unresolved issues on part of the consumer.<p><i>Markets are flawed because the actors in them are not rational or well-informed (which is often an axiom of whatever model one chooses to use), and because the actions available to them are dictated by those currently on top.</i><p>This is the almost cliched refrain of every moral reformer. Market participants are irrational, therefore $SOCIAL_ENGINEERING_POLICY_OF_CHOICE. Of course, there is information asymmetry in <i>anything</i> one does (market or no market), and the classic resolutions are through screening or signaling.<p>(Also, the definitions of &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;informed&quot; in economics are quite different from their colloquial counterparts. Moreover, assuming universal irrationality by default leads to nihilistic conclusions. At least it should anyway, most people use it as an excuse for their pet reforms by completely ignoring the irrationality in state institutions.)<p><i>For instance, violence or overt threats of violence in pursuit of gain is considered to be taboo in markets (that I know of), since those who have goods or the means to produce them generally want to keep that relative power over those who do not.</i><p>What the fuck? Violence is taboo in markets because the bourgeoisie capitalists want to exploit the underdogs? Could it possibly be because the initiation of force against voluntary actors is considered immoral by almost everyone? Hopefully you do, as well, but I can&#x27;t deduce.<p>EDIT: The anti-capitalist and socialist crankery seems to be inherent from examining your post history.",1451278508

I recently developed a web form that has a little over 1,000 lines of JQuery.

10799886,comment,10795296,10799560,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually not so much, there is a fun class they used to give new employees at Google (called Nooglers) called &quot;life of a dollar&quot; (well that was what it was called when I joined) which talked about how Google made money with search advertising. And one of the key things about that class was how the cost per click, or the amount of money Google got when someone clicked a link, was fundamentally tied to how all of the other processes made (or didn&#x27;t make) money. After I left Google four years later, I actually joined another search startup called Blekko where not only did I get to see the &quot;high level&quot; view of where Google made its money (and how much it would share with us if we used their ads) I also got to see the contracts involved and the clauses where Google wanted to protect its margins. We also partnered with one of Google&#x27;s largest advertising redistributors, Infospace.<p>When I left in 2010 I started also following Google&#x27;s financial reports. Year after year, following that indicator you could see pressure on Google&#x27;s search ad business, and you could watch Microsoft&#x27;s Bing ads get to be more and more profitable. Did you know that if in 2010 Microsoft could get the same CPC as Google did for their ads on Bing that Bing would have out performed all other parts of Microsoft in terms of revenue and profit? As a search vendor in the middle I could see what Microsoft shared with us and what Google shared with us, and we could back compute the actual CPC, and the ratio of the CPC. Whats more we could watch Microsoft&#x27;s going up while Google&#x27;s was (and is) continuing to go down.<p>I was also there as their CPC plummeted and they told Infospace (and through them us) that we could no longer show Google ads on Mobile search. No only Google could from now on. And that wasn&#x27;t just us, that was everyone. And we&#x27;ve watched as more and more of their search page became &quot;sponsored&quot; in one form or another, and how people with Google ads on their web sites were getting less and less money, even though their traffic was the same or better.<p>I&#x27;ve been watching the Google money machine slowly deflate for the last 5 years (coming up on 6) and called almost every move they&#x27;ve made prior to them making it. All based on understanding that rounded to the nearest billion dollars, nothing in Google makes any money except search advertising. Even Youtube can barely break even these days and we&#x27;ve seen how the 99% of Youtube &quot;stars&quot; actually have real day jobs rather than be able to produce content for that service. We&#x27;ve seen Google working hard to &quot;yank back&quot; the whole Android is open source thing, in the name of &quot;user experience&quot; to be sure, but attacking Cyanogen? Threatening Samsung? Forcing HTC to throw itself under the Microsoft bus? And paying for more and more traffic, $4 billion a year? how much further can they push that life vest?<p>The good news here is that predictions are like freebies, you win some you lose some. No alien contact this year, sorry Inquirer! But I&#x27;ve been more right than wrong about predicting Google&#x27;s road and I&#x27;m confident in this one too. Google is stuck between a need to please the street and the cost of engineers that produce no revenue. They have way more of the latter than they need, and from what I can tell they have pretty much been aggressive as they can at getting rid of people &quot;gradually&quot; who were in the bottom 10%. And their CPCs continue to fall double digit percentages year over year, and they don&#x27;t have any business that is growing at that rate. Throw in an EU anti-monopoly monkey wrench, or a Facebook throwing their search over to Bing, or the EU getting their tax policy together and eliminating the double irish? Suddenly the need to shed costs fast will overwhelm their ability to do so quietly.<p>I kind of thought they would end up doing that this year but they dodged a bit by turning into Alphabet which gave them some new accounting tricks.<p>I&#x27;m sticking by my prediction they are going to have a layoff next year of between 8 and 12% of the company. They could surprise me by putting a bunch of people into an Alphabet subsidiary and then &quot;divesting&quot; themselves of that subsidiary. It would have to take 8 - 12% of the company though to make it worth while.<p>I understand your angst. Nobody likes to think about the company where they work having layoffs (hey I&#x27;m working at IBM which Cringely is constantly predicting will explode at any moment!) But the truth is that its really all sort of mechanical. Goods and services go out and money comes in. The costs of delivering those goods and services has a variety of components, the largest of which is often personnel.<p>And if you look around and realize the company could be making all the money it is currently making with or without you, and without you it would be banking the cost of your salary and benefits. Well then you need to be especially mindful of the indicators for the current business, and the growth rate of the revenue your project is contributing too the business versus the cost of keeping you around.

For me, it finally explains a lot of lower than expected performance issues I&#x27;ve had with AVX/AVX2.  In case others are interested, here it is.<p>-----<p>Agner wrote:\nYou are always limited by cache ways, read/write buffers, faulty\nprefetching, suboptimal reordering, etc.<p>Yes, although in my example I&#x27;m considering the much simpler case\nwhere there are two reads but no writes, and all data is already in\nL1. So although problematic in the real world, these shouldn&#x27;t be a\nfactor here. In fact, I see the same maximum speed if I read the same\n4 vectors over and over rather than striding over all the data. I&#x27;ve\nrefined my example, though, and think I now understand what&#x27;s\nhappening. The problem isn&#x27;t a bank conflict, rather it&#x27;s a slowdown\ndue to unaligned access. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen this discussed\nbefore.<p>Contrary to my previous understanding, alignment makes a big\ndifference on the speed at which vectors are read from L1 to register.\nIf your data is 16B aligned rather than 32B aligned, a sequential read\nfrom L1 is no faster with 256-bit YMM reads than it is with 128-bit\nXMM reads. VMOVAPS and VMOVUPS have the same speed, but you cannot\nachieve 2 32B loads per cycle if the underlying data is not 32B\naligned. If the data is 32B aligned, you still can&#x27;t quite sustain 64\nB/cycle of load with either, but you can get to about 54 B/cycle with\nboth.<p>I put up new test code here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/nkurz/439ca1044e11181c1089"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/nkurz/439ca1044e11181c1089</a><p>Results at L1 sizes are essentially the same on Haswell and Skylake.<p><pre><code>  Loading 4096 floats with 64 byte raw alignment\n  Vector alignment 8:\n  load_xmm : 19.79 bytes/cycle\n  load_xmm_nonsequential : 23.41 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm : 28.64 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm_nonsequential : 36.57 bytes/cycle\n\n  Vector alignment 16:\n  load_xmm : 29.26 bytes/cycle\n  load_xmm_nonsequential : 29.05 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm : 28.44 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm_nonsequential : 36.90 bytes/cycle\n\n  Vector alignment 24:\n  load_xmm : 19.79 bytes/cycle\n  load_xmm_nonsequential : 23.54 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm : 28.64 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm_nonsequential : 36.57 bytes/cycle\n\n  Vector alignment 32:\n  load_xmm : 29.05 bytes/cycle\n  load_xmm_nonsequential : 28.85 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm : 53.19 bytes/cycle\n  load_ymm_nonsequential : 52.51 bytes/cycle\n</code></pre>\nWhat this says is that unless your loads are 32B aligned, regardless\nof method you are limited to about 40B loaded per cycle. If you are\nsequentially loading non-32B aligned data from L1, the speeds for 16B\nloads and 32B loads are identical, and limited to less than 32B per\ncycle. All alignments not shown were the same as 8B alignment.<p>Loading in a non-sequential order is about 20% faster for unaligned\nXMM and unaligned YMM loads. It&#x27;s possible there is a faster order\nthan I have found so far. Aligned loads are the same speed\nregardless of order. Maximum speed for aligned XMM loads is about 30\nB/cycle, and maximum speed for aligned YMM loads is about 54 B/cycle.<p>At L2 sizes, the effect still exists, but is less extreme. XMM loads\nare limited to 13-15 B/cycle on both Haswell and Skylake. On Haswell,\nYMM non-aligned loads are 18-20 B/cycle, and YMM aligned loads are\n24-26 B/cycle. On Skylake, YMM aligned loads are slightly faster at\n27 B/cycle. Interestingly, sequential unaligned L2 loads on Skylake\nare almost the same as aligned loads (26 B/cycle), while non-sequential\nloads are much slower (17 B/cycle).<p>At L3 sizes, alignment is barely a factor. On Haswell, all loads are\nlimited to 11-13 B/cycle. On Skylake, XMM loads are the same 11-13\nB/cycle, while YMM loads are slightly faster at 14-17 B/cycle.<p>Coming from memory, XMM and YMM loads on Haswell are the same\nregardless of alignment, at about 5 B/cycle. On Skylake, XMM loads\nare about 6.25 B/cycle, and YMM loads are about 6.75 B/cycle, with\nlittle dependence on alignment. It&#x27;s possible that prefetch can\nimprove these speeds slightly.<p>Agner writes:\nThe write operations may sometimes use port 2 or 3 for address\ncalculation, where the maximum throughput requires that they use port\n7.<p>I don&#x27;t recall if you mention it in your manuals, but I presume you\nare aware that Port 7 on Haswell and Skylake is only capable of\n&quot;simple&quot; address calculations?

I can&#x27;t build a library because the point is to not depend on libraries.<p>My suggestion is that if your going to build an application in the browser, your project needs an architecture that will last beyond today&#x27;s libraries and tooling. You want to recognize what&#x27;s unique about your app and express those parts without touching the DOM or network, even if they seem trivial now.<p>My particular favorite way to do that is using an event bus to create a catalog of custom/domain-specific events, with views emitting operation- or command-like events and internal models emitting new states. This is basically the important part of Flux without the special concepts (stores, dispatcher) that you may be fine without, and is already available in jQuery, Backbone, node&#x27;s EventEmitter, and many other libraries out there.<p>React and immutability and the rest of Flux are all very reasonable next steps if somehow you come to need them, but you are likely not spreading your UI development across hundreds of engineers. Unnecessary new stuff is just going to steer your conversations towards libraries and away from your domain.",1451276619

Things like parks, libraries, schools, which are for people and of people, but which increasingly are not by people.<p>> After all, a private property owner may extend nonpossessory or usufructory rights to usage of their land, which would make it perfectly viable for social gatherings without being necessarily more exclusionary than a commons or public ownership.<p>There&#x27;s a difference between being a tenant on someone else&#x27;s charity land and being a member of a community, and although I don&#x27;t really have the expertise, time, or space to go into it, I imagine it involves a sense of belonging and ownership and community, that sort of thing.<p>> The promotion of the nuclear family model is an organic result of prosperity, which enables its existence to thrive.<p>This is true, and we&#x27;ve seen people moving back in with their parents on graduation now that the economy is weaker. This being true doesn&#x27;t preclude there being a narrative that might eg take ideals like Independence and Self-Determination and turn them into a social impetus to form weaker bonds with extended family. I personally think it has a lot to do with our physical mobility increasing faster than our ability to maintain meaningful connections long-distance, but who knows.<p>> Same with beauty standards.<p>This has been problematic for generations and there&#x27;s a lot of literature out there. I think that waving away the effects of image crafting on the psyche of young and impressionable folks in pursuit of profit is wrong of you, and you should consider re-evaluating this stance.<p>> I also fail to see how &quot;promoting exotic vacations and recreational activities&quot; is bad.<p>I mostly agree, except in the sense that people are maybe being sold a bad cure for an ailment they might not have had, spending money they don&#x27;t have, perpetuating the problems that caused them to want to escape in the first place. Again, just for example.<p>For the last sentence, here&#x27;s my interpretation: Markets are flawed because the actors in them are not rational or well-informed (which is often an axiom of whatever model one chooses to use), and because the actions available to them are dictated by those currently on top[1]. I think OP was referring to the way that boiling human interaction down to market interactions - trusting the Market to be a true and somehow just proxy for Everything - is causing problems; that is, trusting markets (alone) to meet human needs is failing.<p>Hope this helps.<p>1. For instance, violence or overt threats of violence in pursuit of gain is considered to be taboo in markets (that I know of), since those who have goods or the means to produce them generally want to keep that relative power over those who do not. We see alternative, or extra-market action in eg ecoterrorism, where someone whose needs or desires are not being met, and who have no in-market recourse, resort to destruction in order to reduce profitability of hummers or whatever.",1451276597

False positives can and do happen, and they lead to unwarranted appointments, specialist visits, exploratory surgeries, etc.  Other reasons physician groups are opposed to it is because they view it as profiting off people who are hypochondriacs, and a huge amount of the customers would probably be drug abusers and steroid users.

This is visionary thinking; maybe realistic, maybe not, but visionary.<p>The Americans have a great love of adventure that extends to space travel, but we are also an impatient people who want Buck Rogers and the 25th Century to happen tomorrow and not in 450 years.<p>Unfortunately, Vietnam and the Great Society and post-Vietnam stagflation of the 1970s put an end to our brief push out of the gravity well.  Trillions of dollars were earmarked for other purposes, pushing Nasa and its quaint, difficult-to-understand projects to the back burner.<p>Post-Apollo, Nasa limped along with the Space Shuttle and the I.S.S., but the Shuttle is dead and the I.S.S. will eventually lose its political support.  Now we can&#x27;t even fly our astronauts to the I.S.S. without Russian assistance.  What kind of commitment to human space flight does that demonstrate?<p>So, it&#x27;s refreshing to see a smart visionary like Elon Musk actually walk the walk.  If he says he&#x27;s going to put a greenhouse full of plants on Mars by 2030, I believe him.  This is a project that Nasa could have, and should have, done long since.<p>But since the country no longer supports this kind of public effort, at least we can place our hopes in private efforts to accomplish the same thing.  Many of the 15th-16th Century explorers of the New World were privately funded, after all.<p>Probably in the end, it will be public-private partnerships that get us into space for good; the country will decide that it wants people to be in space, and firms like SpaceX will become contractors to Nasa like the rocket companies of old.  But the difference will be that these newer companies are space-capable on their own, can launch their own craft from their own pads and bypass Nasa completely.  Perhaps Nasa will then be more of a research organization, doing the deep space probes and basic research that private firms can&#x27;t justify.",1451275758

Those boilerplates include routers, frameworks to bind routers to state, frameworks for server-side rendering, some new ES7 syntactic sugar, a bleeding edge module bundler like Webpack...the list goes on. They may or may not be a great combination of frameworks, but each has their own learning overhead.<p>So people confuse learning react or learning redux with learning how to use every single framework shipped in the common react boilerplates. It can take weeks of studying or learning enough about those frameworks to understand how they all work.<p>React itself is moving along at a healthy pace. Popular frameworks around react change about every week which causes this fatigue that OP speaks of. The most important thing IMO is learning the core concepts behind react, flux, redux, react-router, and worry about product client/server rendering and module bundling later.",1451275722

There is no terse way to describe a UI. Period. C++ or Java I understand they are typed languages with an avowed aim of giving the programmer fine grained control over the program.

Heck I'd use a group giant balls of flaming gas as a transmission medium, then encode data as the pulses of their supernovae. Anything with eyes could receive the data, luckily I would also use RSA encryption and it would sound like noise to everybody else ;p",1278363512

In addition, we regularly look for e-mail newsletter where we can advertise but have trouble finding them—a lot of people want to sell us banner ads on their websites, which have proven useless, but relatively few have newsletters.<p>I'm not sure why this is; I would guess part of it is because people have to actively sign up for a newsletter, rather than merely finding the website through Google or whatever.

1489077,comment,1488891,1488891,0,0,bimble,,,"Not a good comparison, I have to point out.  You appear to have had one VPS on each service and run the test once on each.  No idea how old either was, how crowded the host you wound up on was, or any of that.  So interesting, but not scientific.<p>For all I can tell, the Slicehost VPS may have been very old, and the Linode VPS may have been brand new on a fresh machine (so no one else was using it and eating into the disk access times).<p>The forums for both companies have customers talking about hdparm results and such, so it's worth looking there for a broader sample.  In general, people testing an existing VPS against a new one (for either service) tend to see better results on the new one.  It's just a fact of life if you get a VPS - the old hardware stays in service because customers still run on it, and those customers don't want unnecessary downtime.  For best results, make a new slice on each, talk to the techs at each to make sure you're in their latest and greatest datacenter, and then see how things stack up.<p>It's also worth pointing out another caveat with a VPS - shared disk access.  So for scientific results you'd also need a way to control for the number of users on the box, and their usage patterns.  If some jerk on your machine consistently thrashes the disk with swap access, it's going to be a pain on any service until their admins see it happening and reboot that VPS.",1278363337

1489074,comment,1482242,1484670,0,0,ktsmith,,,"I can't speak to anything but my own experience. Having helped on a few ecommerce sites for very small merchants, the amount of fraudulent purchases that came through was staggering. One of those companies has been open for about six months now and is only breaking even in large part due to the expense of dealing with chargebacks. What they have observed is that a significant number of cards were tested through what appears to have been a rented botnet. Those went away with the addition of a captcha. The remaining fraud that looks like card testing (only purchases of low value items, with IP's far away from the billing address and similar peculiarities) are often done from Tor exit nodes.<p>Small merchants have very little support in this area. Local authorities often don't care or have the man power to deal with these types of issues. The banks and visa/mastercard also don't care since they just force the merchant to eat the costs and still collect all their fees. It would be very difficult to tie these transactions back to any one person in most cases as the tester is going to be using a valid card, valid billing/shipping address. Once they know the card works they can just have a mule go get a cash advance from an ATM or start having big ticket items shipped to various places for pickup. Or they just resell the card info as verified which increases the value significantly.",1278363190

1489072,comment,1478827,1478827,0,0,TheLastPsych,,,"As the author of the article, I thought I'd add my observation about the comments here.<p>The point of my post was twofold.<p>First, an observation about what we think we know.  When you say, ""tiananmen square massacre"" to people, most have a basic understanding of what happened, EXCEPT that the single image they have associated with it is the one of the student in front of the tank.  That incident happened, of course, but it was the image selected to ""teach"" you about that incident, and that's what stuck.  1) This allows you to think you know something (one image), thought you don't know really anything (what was the point of the whole thing?) 2) you know only what someone else decided to tell you.  If they had chosen to show you a pic of a student dropping a hand grenade in a tank, well, there you go.<p>Second, the most pointed criticisms on this board come from scientists (e.g. electromagnetic).  This is because you're not relying on words, you're actually trying to understand the process.  Some will do it better than others, fine; but my point was that most people are not taught that that process is important, they are taught only to ""know"" things.  In college I knew a guy who could identify a lot (30?) dinosaurs.  By name. Is he an expert?  Everyone thought he was.<p>Point: when I asked him what the modern descendant of the triceratops was, he said it was a rhino.  And no one disagreed with him, even after I pointed out that triceratops laid eggs and rhinos don't.  He didn't know that, but even once he knew it it did not change his thinking; he was taught to think in terms of names and appearances, and he applied himself accordingly.  (I write that story up, in case anyone cares.)<p>That he thought he was an expert is fine; that he didn't know dinos laid eggs is also fine, but it is of importance to understand the divergence between egg layers and mammals.  That's where most people fail, and that's entirely the fault of the way we learn: the news.<p>It's not school-- we barely remember much.  But watch a segment on the news, and you think you're informed, and then you extrapolate from that ""information"" entirely on the force of prejudices you've acquired from watching other news...<p>Who thinks China is mean to students?  Ask around.  Then ask them why they think that.  I hope it obvious that had the desire of the news media been to tell you that the Chines govt. was nice to them...<p>I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but let me spin it around.  While I'm guessing most of you are technically oriented, how many would bristle if, after a catastrophe, the government refused to send in crisis counselors and mental health support people to the site?  It's not been shown to be effective, and could be counterproductive.  But your intuition might suggest to you that it should be done, and so the govt. is left defending itself.  Or perhaps you have a strong opinion on what Paulson should have done with AIG.  Or whatever-- there is some field out of your expertise where you abandon your logical and scientific mind, in favor of prejudice and presumption in the form of empty words.  And you don't know it.<p>The criticism that I am a poor writer is a common one.  I know, I know.<p>I hope I made my point here (and perhaps enticed some readers?) without offending anyone, which is something I try very hard not to do.<p>Cheers.",1278363143

For non cash intensive startups going after VC it's a distraction especially if they are not Top Tier VCs:
* VCs are extractors not builders
* they are on the board and are going to give their ""opinions"" and often they never were tech founders themselves
* best advice comes from having gone through the same thing as the founders: building a company vs sitting in (board) meetings
* if you raised with a VC at seed level and that VC does not follow up, you are dead (negative signaling)
* VCs want to ""put a lot of money at work"" to justify their work. The bigger their fund the more they have to justify their management fees and the less company they fund the easier the job even if risky.
* it is their job not a hobby: pressure to succeed or pretend. More at stake than for Angels or angels agregate in seedfunds. Angels most of the time already made their money and built their reputation. They consider more it play money and more ready to lose it.
* It takes more time to raise with them than with angels or seed funds

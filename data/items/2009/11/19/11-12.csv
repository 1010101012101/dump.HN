950089,comment,949971,949971,0,0,tumult,,,"Read this earlier. Dead on. Any company which cannot build decent software does not have a bright future. Not just in computers -- probably any field. Software is becoming a more pervasive part of life every year. The many who cannot adapt will be easily replaced by the few who can. And with software, it really is easy for one person or company to replace thousands in a single stroke.<p>For now, though, this effect is probably most visible in the tech field. There's a large and growing disparity in profits between companies which can produce good software, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, and those which cannot. I suspect this disparity will more and more reflect how the economy functions for individuals. It wouldn't surprise me if the wealth gap further widens every year. I'm not sure if our politicians, society or culture are prepared to deal with it.",1258631661

If asking a woman about how attractive a man is based only on a photo you will get results like that because you've withheld most of the information she'd use to judge his attractiveness in person.",1258630901

I've got a client site that does fade-in/fade-out effects on multiple simultaneous elements, ajaxyness, and horizontally scrolled lists of images.

DirectWrite's support for Y-directional subpixel antialiasing and subpixel positioning is what IE9 will benefit from. (A DirectWrite backend is in the works for Firefox, too.)<p>DirectWrite rendering is better than the next best Windows rendering, which has so far been the best rendering across OSes -- yes, this is a personal opinion, and no, I'm not interested in debating the relative merits of Windows and OS X rendering. Unless Firefox gets its DirectWrite backend first, IE9 will have the best rendering available on any desktop platform.",1258629901

But it was either needed or fun. To read code as an exercise can be pretty boring I guess, this is not what programming should look like.<p>I can't see how there is so much value in reading a big codebase that expresses more or less the same style and patterns in many places. Maybe it's better to check for <i>some</i> interesting code in different projects. I bet that reading SICP or an algorithms book and to code <i>a lot</i> is a much better way to spend your time.<p>A good approach IMHO is to try to write some non trivial code, for instance an interpreter for a simple programming language, and if you have problems try to check what other code looks like and how it address the same problems you are facing. Then it will no longer be a pain to read parts of the implementation of Ruby or Python or Tcl, since you are discovering very interesting things, solutions to problems you encountered.<p>Another thing that's worth a lot more your time is to learn new programming languages. But there is no point in learning Python if you know Ruby, or the contrary. You should try to learn languages that are <i>really</i> different. For instance SmallTalk, FORTH, Lisp, C, Assembler, Haskell, Joy, Ruby, Tcl are different enough.",1258628561

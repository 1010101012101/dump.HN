Indeed, the frequency with which Comcast's DNS server stops responding to me has me switching to 8.8.8.8 on a bi-montly basis (and screwing up all the CDNs at the same time).<p>Shutting down this rogue DNS server will have little to no serious consequence on people's lives - it's not like the ""internet"" is a reliable service.

3767170,comment,3763781,3765316,2,0,gruseom,,,"I would phrase category A differently: when the work is valuable for its own sake. That's not necessarily fun. It's more likely grueling. Even when it's fun, the fun parts don't add up to nearly as much fun as the painful parts do pain. Yet one can continue because one senses (I almost wrote ""knows"" - can one know?) that the work is valuable, necessary, important. That's deeper than fun.<p>What I find interesting is that this comes from within. The other two motivations you list are external. I wonder if the external ones burn out sooner.<p>When your motivation is intrinsic (that is, you have a felt sense of the work and you know what it is and you think it's important) you have a basis for deciding when to listen or not listen to other people's opinions. But when it's extrinsic, you're more likely to do what other people say and perhaps give up if it doesn't work.<p>Edit: another thing about intrinsic motivation is that because other people don't have the same sense that you do, what you're doing may seem absurd and they will tell you you're doing it wrong. So the challenge of this path is not just the work is hard and that you fail a lot; it's also that it will probably force you beyond the pale of social proof, something humans are not hard-wired to enjoy.",1332953611

3767147,comment,3766727,3766727,5,0,tedchs,,,"I am a DNS and network engineer.  DDoSing the DNS root servers is extremely unlikely to succeed, for multiple reasons:<p>1. The ""root servers"" are not 13 physical servers attached to the Internet.  Each IP is anycasted from multiple locations around the world.  You can validate this by tracerouting to one of the IP's from different points on the Internet.  Almost certainly, each of those locations has multiple high-power physical servers handling requests (either with a hardware load balancer or anycast).<p>2. The people who run the root servers have thought about this already and taken appropriate countermeasures.<p>3. What many folks do not understand is the root servers do a very very small amount of work.  They do not contain records for second-level domains (example.com).  Their sole purpose is to hold the NS records that delegate the ""."" zone to the nameservers of the various TLD's -- .com, .us, .uk, etc.  Each of those TLD's has its own set of nameservers that <i>then</i> delegate to other name servers.  If you were to configure your NS records in Godaddy or Netsol, those records are served from the TLD's nameservers, not the root nameservers.  The root nameservers have zero knowledge of, say, example.com itself.  What they do ""know"" is that the .com nameservers (a.gtld-servers.net through l.gtld-servers.net) do ""know"" how to resolve the name.<p>4. As others have said, there is extensive caching in the global DNS system.  For example, records for the delegation from ""."" to ""com."" have a TTL of 6 days.  This means that, theoretically, the root servers can all go totally offline for up to 6 days before the ISPs' caches would start to expire.  Even if those caches expire, smarter ISP's will NOT simply drop those records from their cache and starting throwing errors -- they will retain the ""stale"" cached records until the authoritative nameservers come back online.",1332953428

At most I'd make a few tentative marks before going ahead and cutting it. When you give a problem like this in an interview, you can assume you're expected to prove your relevant skills to the job.

That must be way every fifth post is about how to focus, how the ""get things done"", etc. Well, if we are ""capable"", we sure don't seem like it. Check those kinds of blogs: people that post on such things rarely post on more important issues.<p>Besides, even if you are ""capable of worrying about multiple cultural issues"", by worrying about both trivial and important things at the same time, you confuse your priorities or get paralyzed.<p><i>>Don't try and derail this one, because it's relevant to many, many people, and it's a serious issue in this industry.</i><p>It's only a ""serious issue"" in that it's being discussed a lot. It's not a serious issue in its manifestation or it's consequences at all.<p>As for women in IT, well, ever considered they just don't like it that much? It's not like being a man or a woman only affects your tastes towards some industry due to the sexism (or ""sexism"") in it.<p>Besides possible differences in inherent tastes (due to evolutionary traits), society also shapes men and women differently. For example, women being given barbie dolls and men Lego by their parents might be a much more important reason for them not liking IT, than any sexism in the IT industry.<p>When students pick up a university course, for example, they hardly have any idea about how the industry is. In my country at least, they don't have any idea at all --almost no one works as an internet or similar anywhere before graduating from university. Still, that doesn't prevent women/men applying to study IT in university being around 20:80. Other fields are Math, Medicine and Physics, which are like 50:50, and Biology, with is like 60:40.

3767068,comment,3765717,3765969,2,0,lambda,,,"> In almost all states, if the wife gets pregnant by another man, the man is still on the hook for child support for the next 18+ years... even if she divorces him and marries her lover.<p>This is a complex situation; it's not an anti-male law, but an attempt at a pro-child, and pro-relationship, law. Read this article for a discussion of some of the difficulties: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/magazine/22Paternity-t.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/magazine/22Paternity-t.htm...</a> . The issue is that when a man has started raising a child, and treating him or her as his own child, he has an obligation to that child. Even if the parents end up divorcing, he has still committed to raising that child. In some cases, he can end his obligation if he also ends his relationship with the child. But in many cases the (non-biological) fathers don't want to do that; they want to have their cake and eat it too, still acting as the father while not being financially obligated to support the child.<p>Part of the issue is that the law is just outdated. As the article above points out, it is based on the common-law assumption that a child born in wedlock is the husband's unless he's impotent, sterile, or ""beyond the four seas"" when the child is conceived. Now that we have better methods of determining paternity, we can do a more accurate job, but you still need to take into account the impact on the child and their relationships with their parents if you suddenly declare that the man who raised them is suddenly no longer their father.<p>And yes, this is pretty off-tangent here. Just because there is a different sort of injustice elsewhere, doesn't mean that an on-topic, relevant injustice is invalid or should be ignored. We are discussing sexist behavior in the workplace among programmers, a relevant topic, which doesn't really have anything to do with paternity laws.",1332952499

The more people realize that their actions might have unintentional and unpleasant consequences, the better they'll be at checking their behavior and making adjustments.

There's actually a couple of pieces to this one: it's non-compacting, so your app gradually slows down; and (because it's Boehm) it has to guess at what's a pointer, and sadly just doesn't do a good job, so you gradually leak RAM through no fault of your own.  The new GC, which I think is called SGen, is a precise collector, so I assume that it fixes the memory leaks, but it's still non-compacting, meaning you're probably going to want to restart the process every once and awhile to prevent serious heap fragmentation.<p>2.  Mono gradually became unstable the longer it ran.  This grew exponentially worse as you added threads.<p>Both of these issues can be circumvented by having multiple processes in a load-balanced configuration and simply restarting them every once and awhile.  Heck, IIS does that with App Pool recycling anyway, and it doesn't have these issues.<p>The FogBugz team still uses Mono to host FogBugz on Unix systems, I believe by going the reboot-every-so-often route, so I assume they've found ways of living with the above two constraints.",1332952219

They used extremely colorful terms (""divisive! harmful!""), but that's essentially what it boils down to: It's fine that ""len"", ""dict"", and ""list"" are builtins, but it's horrible that web2py introduces a few more for web2py apps (""request"", ""response"", ""session"", and a few others). Well, that's not much more than a difference of opinion. They feel very strongly about it, for some reason.<p>ronacher also dislikes web2py's use of ""exec"" for some reason. Almost all of his criticism is meritless (web2py precompiles for production, and the namespaces are used as he thinks they should be). The part that isn't, about classes with destructors leaking is valid, but it's a general Python ""bug"" that web2py potentially amplifies if you use it -- but it is not idiomatic in either Python or Web2py.<p>It's rather telling that every single strong criticism of web2py you can find on the web comes from someone who has never used it, and more often than not has some vested interest in a competing framework.<p>Web2py is not perfect, far from it -- but it is extremely well built, very robust, has a lively and helpful community, and gets things done quickly and well. Give it a try when you have the time and feeling curious.",1332951947

The protagonist is supposed to be this ""naturally talented genius"" who detests the bookish Indian academic education system, so throughout the film he takes potshots at the stuff he's taught in school, ultimately choosing to drop out without a degree until the Dean formally requests him to take the finals, upon which he gets the highest grade in the university. Its a completely one-sided portrayal, and while it is valid in the sense that Indian education system is wholly bunk, it is unfair to draw any deep profound lessons out of a shallow screenplay played for laughts. The pencil thing as has been pointed out by the commentators below is an urban legend.<p>The most talkedabout scene in the whole film involves a vaginal delivery using a vacuum blower as a suction device, and a AA battery as an inverter as the OB barks out instructions on a webcam. As a former electrical engineer I refuse to even entertain the possibility of such a stunt. Yet everybody in the media - the newspapers/TV/talkshows went gaga over this scene, suposedly a parable for ""necessity is the mother(pun intended) of invention"".<p>There's 2 scenes where the conductivity of brine is demonstrated when a person urinating on a live wire gets electrocuted, again played for laughs.<p>There's a scene where a student in his final year is unable to graduate because his thesis involves getting a toy helicopter to fly. He's unable to figure out the propulsion mechanics, so in disgust he throws the helicopter into the trash. The hero, our natural genius sophomore, picks up this helicopter, spends the time rigging up wires in the EE lab & finally gets it to fly. He puts a camera on the copter & as it coasts high in the air, it captures the video of the senior who has committed suicide by hanging in his dorm! Now is that crass or what ? Commiting suicide for failing to figure out some stupid propulsion mechanics! I remember thinking at the time that if this same film had been made in English, the critics & audience in the US would have torn it to shreds for such pandering & crass footage. But India being what it is, this very scene was lauded for its authenticity!<p>Even setting aside all that, the wrapping a string around your palm 11 times is simply trading off precision for some trial & error , not sme clever solution.

The bandwidth to give everyone in a mid sized city 100mb internet access costs around 20$/person a month + the cost of the wires.

Google+ is a Google product that ties up all their services and as such, makes a ton of sense.<p>The whole point of the article is to alude not to how good/bad Google+ is (heck, the article has nothing to do with Google+ at all - which you probably noticed, or should have), but how Google would be so much better if they looked back at their roots.",1332950546

Still, I fell in love with Pyramid <i>because</i> it didn't try to do much for me.<p>My previous company has a huge SQLAlchemy-based codebase with literally hundreds of defined classes, many with hugely complex relationships (as it was built on top of a legacy database that had accreted over many years). Switching to a non-Alchemy backend simply wasn't an option. They also have a large, complex web application built in Zope  with hundreds of tested, working page templates. Django is the easy first choice when starting a new Python web app. However, if we'd replaced the Django ORM with SQLAlchemy and Django's templates with something like ZPT so that we could incorporate our large pre-existing code, there wouldn't have been a lot of Django we could still use. In particular, the admin would have been virtually unusable without a large amount of reimplementation to adapt it to our internal code.<p>Pyramid was a big win for us in that it used our preferred backend choices by default. More importantly, though, was that it's comparatively very easy to change those defaults without losing the rest of Pyramid's features. After a couple of hours of experimenting with integrating our legacy codebase, I had new pages up and running.<p>I have nothing bad to say about Django and I've used it successfully in other projects. It's a neat framework with a lot of talented people behind it. But Pyramid has its own charms, especially for those who absolutely need to do things their own way.",1332950502

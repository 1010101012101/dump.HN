And I realized the power that lawyers/prosecutors wield over accused is enormous. To <i>win</i> a case they can design outrageous plea bargains - plead guilty and get 5 years, don&#x27;t plead and face death if convicted. Even if lawyers representing accused try to educate him that the chances of conviction are less than 1% the fear of facing death penalty is so enormous that accused typically end up pleading guilty. And not without a reason. Loss aversion plays a big role when a human arrives at a decision. And just like that the prosecutor who initially had a very little chance of winning the case ends up winning it.<p>I know that I&#x27;m sort of oversimplifying here but the key take away here is that prosecutor has absolutely nothing to lose! Well OK, he could end up <i>losing</i> the case but that&#x27;s nothing compared to what accused stand to lose. There needs to be a counterbalance to the power wielded by prosecutors, and this is a good start!<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7998287"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7998287</a>",1446108211

Writing free software is incredibly easy because you need only a bare minimum of building blocks.  Also once the initial tool set is built, anyone can join with virtually no cost to entry (for example, if you had emacs and GCC binaries and a computer capable of running them, you could participate in free software).<p>Free hardware is completely different.  You have to rely on other organizations all the way down the chain.  And even if you manage to build a tool set to build something, it&#x27;s not like anyone else can simply copy it and get started.  They end up having almost the same struggle that you did.<p>Consider as well how long it took for the free software view point to become acceptable to mainstream thinking.  Even today, almost 2016, there are huge populations of programmers who think free software is crazy.  But now there are companies built on free software with near billion dollar valuations, and other companies mostly built with free software that are in the many-billions-of-dollars of valuation.  The concept has gotten over the hump, though it was a huge struggle for decades (and it continues to be necessary to make sure that legislation doesn&#x27;t take our freedom away).<p>Software was crazily hard.

10469800,comment,10468755,10468755,0,0,todd8,,,"TeX&#x27;s macro style of programming is too difficult. Nevertheless, people have done amazing things with it.<p>TeX has somewhere around 325 primatives, and one of the most important is the \def primative used to define macros. These primatives are used to define additional macros, hundreds of them, available in different so called formats. A basic format known as Plain TeX includes about 600 macros in addition to the 325 primatives. LaTeX is another format, the most widely used, but there are others, like ConTeXt, that are also very capable. Each of these extend TeX&#x27;s primatives with their own macros resulting in different kinds of markup language.<p>TeX&#x27;s primatives are focused on the low level aspects of typesetting (font sizes, text positions, alignment, etc.). LaTeX provides a markup language that is focused on the logical description of the document&#x27;s components: headings, chapters, itemized lists, and so forth. The result is a system that does simple things easily while allowing very complex typesetting to be performed when needed.<p>In addition to the TeX core primatives and the hundreds of commands (implemented as macros) in a format like LaTeX there are additional packages, classes, and styles that are used to provide support for any conceivable document. LaTeX has a rich ecosystem of packages. Typesetting chess? There&#x27;s a LaTeX package for that. Complex diagrams and graphics, there&#x27;s a LaTeX package for that. Writing a paper in the style of Tufte? Writing a book? or a musical score? or building a barcode? there are packages for that. The documentation for the Tikz & PGF graphics package is over 1100 pages long! The documentation for the Memoir package is 570 pages.<p>The amazing thing is that all of this is built out of macros. Diving into this, and once one needs to customize the look of a document it&#x27;s inevitable, you find yourself in a maze of twisty little passages.<p>Once upon a time, while writing assembly language for large computers, I enjoyed writing fancy assembler macros. I was facinated with Calvin Moore&#x27;s Trac programming language based on macros and Christopher Strachey&#x27;s General Purpose Macrogenerator. These were early (mid 1960&#x27;s) explorations into the viability of macro processors as means for expressing arbitrary computations. Reader&#x27;s interested in trying out macros for programming can try the m4 programming language (by Kernighan and Ritchie) found on Unix and Linux systems. m4 is used in autoconf and sendmail config files. Yet, TeX macros are in a whole other dimension.<p>All of these powerful macro systems have one thing in common: parameterized macros can be expanded into text that is then rescanned looking for newly formed macros calls (or new macro definitions) to expand as many times as one wants. This isn&#x27;t just an occasional leaky abstraction; it is programming by way of leaky abstractions. Looking at TeX packages is some of the most difficult programming that I&#x27;ve done. It&#x27;s unbelievably impressive what people have come up with (e.g. floating point implemented via macro expansion in about 600 lines of TeX), but it&#x27;s also unbelievably frustrating to program in such an environment.<p>The LaTeX3 project is an attempt to rewrite LaTeX (still running on top of the TeX core). Started in the early 1990&#x27;s it is still not done. I think its just that they are mired in a swamp of macros. They do have a relatively stable set of macros written, with the catchy name expl3, that are intended for use when writing LaTeX3. Here&#x27;s a sample<p><pre><code>     \cs_gset_eq:cc\n    { \cf@encoding \token_to_str:N  #1 } { ? \token_to_str:N #1 }\n</code></pre>\nThis is described in the documentation as being a big improvement over the old macros and &quot;far more readable and more likely to be correct first time&quot;. I can&#x27;t wait.<p>I think LaTeX is absolutely without peer, but I wish improving it&#x27;s programming method wasn&#x27;t so daunting. I keep toying with starting a project to do just that, but so many others have tried and failed. It&#x27;s disheartening.<p>Links:<p>[TRAC] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAC_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAC_(programming_language)</a><p>[GPM] <a href=""http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/225.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/8/3/225.full.pdf</a><p>[m4] info pages available on Unix and Linux<p>[Tikz & PGF] <a href=""https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en</a><p>[Memoir] <a href=""https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ctan.org/pkg/memoir?lang=en</a><p>[expl3] <a href=""https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94wright-latex3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb30-1/tb94wright-latex3.pdf</a>",1446107564

Even if everything goes as expected, they are cutting you up, and putting you under drugs that mess with you so badly that you don&#x27;t notice them cutting you up. You spend at least a few days, if not weeks, recovering, usually involving more drugs which come with side effects and addiction risk.<p>And that is when it goes right.<p>There are always small percentages thrown at you of the chance of possible complications, so a 3% risk of a drug problem is another one to add to the list.

If, on the other hand, you had Pascal-style strings with a known length up front instead of null-terminated strings, then the mispredict could be resolved independently of loading every byte of the string, and it could have outstanding loads for two strings simultaneously. But only for strings that span more than one cacheline.<p>The only limit for speculation is the OoOE buffers. I abbreviated it, but the inner loop is a minimum of 5 Âµops, so you actually end up hitting the ROB limit at 39 iterations before the store buffer is full. Though some architectures could reduce it to 4 with a compare+branch instruction. (x86 fuses this sequence to one Âµop but I&#x27;m not sure if it reduces the ROB entries)<p>If you don&#x27;t hit the ROB limit, then even after you hit the store buffer limit, the load buffer can take some loads. So assuming 4 Âµops, 42 stores and 48 loads would be actively buffered while their cache misses are resolved.<p>There&#x27;s no public documentation on what modern CPUs actually do for branch prediction; that&#x27;s why I said &quot;likely&quot; - I&#x27;m not claiming that any specific CPU does precisely what I described.

Goodbye my account and all connected Amazon services together with AWS (with all the files and sites hosted...). As you can see below(1), &quot;your account cannot be reopened&quot; - I cannot even use AWS contact form, because I must sign in before. Amazon people from the main contact site don&#x27;t know how to help me. So here I am, with a few sites hosted on AWS and no access to them.<p>(1)\n&quot;Hello from Amazon Payments.&quot;<p>&quot;We are writing to inform you that we have closed your Amazon Payments account and cancelled all open orders.&quot;<p>&quot;We took these actions because our records indicate that an unauthorized person has logged into your account. For your security, the credit card information stored on your account cannot be accessed via our website and your full credit card number is not displayed in your account.&quot;<p>&quot;Due to this unauthorized access, your account cannot be reopened. In order to continue shopping with Amazon Payments, we ask that you open a new Amazon account. Your order history and additional features such as Wishlists cannot be transferred to your new account.&quot;<p>&quot;We are unable to say how your sign in information was obtained since the activities used to obtain these details occur away from our website. Some techniques used to gain access include using malicious software to capture a user&#x27;s keystrokes and Internet activity, trying commonly-used passwords, and sending fraudulent e-mails requesting recipients provide or update personal, financial, or other account information (commonly known as &quot;phishing&quot;).&quot;<p>&quot;For information about safe online shopping, please visit the &quot;Security, Privacy & Accessibility&quot; section of our Amazon.com Help pages.&quot;<p>&quot;We regret any inconvenience, and we hope you will provide us the opportunity to serve you as a customer again.&quot;",1446106123

In the case of Homejoy, my assumption is that the claims/promises they made constitute a contract with their users that limits their ability to make use of your data outside the described scope. IANAL, but I think there&#x27;s a reason we don&#x27;t regularly hear about things like this - it&#x27;s actually hard to do without getting sued.",1446105661

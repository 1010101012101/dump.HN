470846,comment,470798,470819,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It sounds like he's no longer able to pay the mortgage because his business has fallen off a cliff.  Customers that were willing to part with their money in good economic times have disappeared in bad economic times.<p>It'd be really easy to blame him for taking out a mortgage he can't afford, but this is what happens in recessions.  While the money supply is being inflated, some investments that are marginal (like his business, apparently) seem pretty attractive.  When the money supply starts contracting, they suddenly get squeezed out of existence - which forces them to default on their debts, which further contracts the money supply.  Financially, the right thing for this guy to do is to let the bank foreclose, but in the short run that'll make things worse for everyone else.",1233986238

I grew up living in Government funded housing and eating thanks only to the welfare system.  That, combined with working my way up to the point that I now have money as an adult, makes me see financial matters differently than others around here.<p>I accept that.<p>But give me a break.  Boo Hoo, her house is only worth $700,000 now.  She spent nearly $50,000 upgrading it and now its worth less.  Oh the Horror.<p>I get that it hurts when you have to go down a step in your standard of living.  I’m not entirely unsympathetic.  But there are millions working to have a place to live at all.  So I can’t spare much sympathy for this woman.<p>Short sell the house, find a place you can afford and shut the hell up.  Getting kicked out of your $700,000 house is not the end of the world",1233985535

I think it's equally wrong to view it as an external force that just happens to visit people at certain times.<p>In my experience, genius is the result of turning over a problem in your head over and over, learning all the angles, and then relaxing and forgetting about it for a while.  While you're forgetting about it, your brain can make subconscious connections between everything you've learned that seem to come from nowhere.  But <i>you have to have the background knowledge</i>.<p>I find that I have tons of creative ideas when I'm just starting out a project.  They almost all turn out to be bad ones.  Then once I explore a bit, learn everything there is to know about the area, I'll <i>occasionally</i> get a decent idea.  If I don't think too hard about it.",1233985368
470838,comment,470254,470827,0,0,wheels,,,"Fortran 77 is still pretty widely used in physics, with some relaxed compiler rules that make it a little less ugly.  Fortran 90 is however, I find, a lot more like Pascal.<p>I suspect you're right on Java surviving as a legacy language.<p>While I'm not sure (and really don't care) if Java or the JVM will survive for an extended period of time, I do find it interesting to note that programming languages seem to be comparatively resilient to change relative to everything else in computing.  While the FORTRAN in that photo looks odd, it's still a comparatively small gap between it and FORTRAN from 40 years later than if we were to compare the operating systems, applications or user interfaces from similar time spans.  I can still figure out what it's supposed to do.  I'd be completely lost if you put me on a batch terminal or a VAX/VMS prompt.<p>The last really transformational idea in programming languages hit the world the same year I was born -- in 1980 -- with Smalltalk.  There are a lot of variations on the themes of functional, imperative, and object oriented languages, and I expect new metaphors will evolve, but it's interesting seeing that really, now for at least the last almost 30 years, we've basically been remixing ideas.<p>And that's where I'd revisit Java for a moment -- perhaps the only transformational change that it brought to the table was the use of a formalized VM in a widely popular language.  Even if Java's VM doesn't survive, I'm pretty sure that's a notion that we'll still have in programming environments for many decades out.",1233985326

There's lots of COBOL code out there, but <i>nobody</i> wants to maintain it.<p>2019's only 10 years away though, and 10 years is relatively short in programming language terms.  10 years ago, the languages commonly used in industry were C++, Java, VB, Perl, and PHP.

The mathematical idea at the heart of Lisp is still around, but those don't time out.  And Fortran is alive in the sense that there is something called Fortran, but it probably has less in common with Fortran I than with other more recent languages.<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/history.html</a><p>If Java survives till 2109, it would probably be in the latter sense.

To provide the know-why, we must understand ourselves, our context, and our objective.<p>We also need to understand whether we (our system and sub-systems) and our context (our super-system) are purposeful: can any of these systems select their own means and ends.

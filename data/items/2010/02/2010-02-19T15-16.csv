Actually no. I don't think it makes much sense and I don't agree
that the concept is sound. Spokes distribute load and allow for 
lightweight rim, this construction just concentrates load on few
points—looks like it is just asking rim to be squashed.

The point is that nearly nobody would even understand what such a choice is, and in an environment where nobody fully understands the implications of their actions, it is not a legitimate argument to then cite people's actions as supporting the current system.

Copyright deals with rights in written works. Trademark is about rights to brand names and marks on products. Rights of publicity are about using famous people's names and likenesses without authorization.<p>I don't know much about right of publicity, but as far as trademark goes at least, there is this exception known as ""nominative use,"" which basically allows you to use a trademark to refer to a product, so long as it doesn't look like you are using the name to market your own products. This is what allows you to use a trademarked product name in a review, for example.<p>My guess is that, in this case, the company could have pushed back a bit on the IOC's blanket warning. Nominative use (which, incidentally, is backed by the First Amendment) would at least protect the right to report newsworthy events about Olympians. But if the company's reports start to look more like product endorsements or marketing pitches, it would become a different question.",1266594850

Whenever a ""friend"" uses an Facebook application, that application has access not only to their list of friends but to yours.<p>Recently, Facebook took information that was shared by users under an agreement and setting that kept it private (e.g. profile pictures), and forced it, pre-emptively, to be public.  Except for the weasel words that were surely already in their user agreement, they broke if not their legal contract then certainly their social contract with their users.<p>What is reasonable?

1137176,comment,1136664,1137068,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> There is a fundamental difference between the government spying on citizens or abusing the information they collect, and companies doing so.<p>I respectfully disagree. It doesn't matter whether, for example, an identity thief obtains the personal information necessary to take over my life from a government database leak or from a private company. The consequences are just as damaging.<p>Moreover, I find no meaningful distinction between the power of government and the power of megacorps any more. The gap between the power of the individual and the power of the state/megacorp is so vast either way that either is a fundamental threat to quality of life if they screw up.<p>> People voluntarily sign onto Facebook every day, and the company does not violate its privacy policy (if it did, you'd have grounds for a law suit).<p>Well, firstly, I challenge your claim that they always operate within their privacy policy. For example, Facebook collected vast amounts of information about me without my knowledge or consent, because a huge part of their <i>modus operandi</i> is to get friends to contribute information about each other and develop their database via networking effects.<p>Secondly, I don't think their privacy policy really matters, because it's one of those legal cop-out things (if it even has any legal weight at all) that companies hide behind when they do something unreasonable. As we see in cases like the recent Buzz mess, there is a world of difference between what people might think they are agreeing to and what a company's lawyers think their privacy policy lets them get away with. This is a well-known legal problem, and indeed most jurisdictions have provisions in law specifically for cases where there is an agreement between two parties with disproportionate power to negotiate the terms.<p>In any case, these companies can and do vary their privacy policies on a whim. A privacy policy is a PR exercise, and little more. The big names have shown repeatedly that they cannot be trusted to safeguard sensitive information properly, and that they will push and if necessary break the boundaries of reasonable behaviour as much as they can get away with. People's privacy is too important to allow that kind of unregulated power, precisely because once lost it is difficult to ever regain.<p>Finally, the ""you can raise a lawsuit"" argument is pretty meaningless in a pay-your-own-fees jurisdiction. No individual is likely to receive sufficient compensation for any abuses even to cover the costs of bringing the case, unless there has been a serious event that follows a breach. The big companies know this, so they can happily go around risking everyone's privacy, and write off the costs of paying out compensation in any cases that do go to court as a mere business expense. This is not an effective deterrent, which is why I say we need company-destroying penalties for people who deliberately violate people's privacy or abuse their databases. Making it a criminal act and throwing the directors in jail is an acceptable alternative. Making them turn up in court as a formality and issuing a fine so puny that a first-line manager can pay it out of his expenses budget is not.<p>> It's not the government's place to institute laws to protect consumers from themselves.<p>Oh, I disagree. For one thing, I disagree with your characterisation of people as mere consumers. In many cases where databases are being built, the information is collected indirectly, not via a simple supplier/consumer relationship. And of course there are some services that are effectively essential, or indeed things you are legally required to have, and while you may be a consumer of such a service you don't get any choice to opt out (or your only choice is between providers with similarly dangerous policies regarding personal data).<p>In any case, I think it <i>is</i> the government's job to protect the little guy. It is one of the most fundamental and necessary requirements of any civilised government that it protect the individual against abuses by those more powerful than the individual alone can fight. Pretty much all law is based on this premise.<p>Of course people have to take reasonable responsibility for their own behaviour. I'm not disputing that, or saying that the government should clean up after someone who is grossly negligent or knowingly does something that will endanger themselves. But there is a difference between that and expecting an average person going about their daily life to fully comprehend all the legal subtleties and dangers in the world around them, which no-one on this planet can do completely.<p>> The proper action here is educating people about privacy, not adding more legislation.<p>I'm all for putting education ahead of legislation, and I absolutely agree that awareness about privacy issues needs to be raised.<p>But you have to have legislation to back things up. There's no point raising awareness if you don't provide an effective redress if megacorps violate the privacy policies that an educated user carefully read. There's no point expecting people to look after themselves if you're going to uphold a 20 page privacy policy written by a team of professional lawyers that would take a typical person several days and several thousand in legal fees to understand.<p>What is needed is a combination. By all means, make education the priority. But right now, there are abuses going on that affect even savvy users; it's not as if everyone who just got done over by Google's Buzz problems is a clueless person who should have known that by signing up to a completely unrelated Google service they were opting in to this.",1266594843

You need to follow good procedures that you will learn with experience, you need to have certain qualities, not the least of which are <i>social skills</i> -- bad research well described will trump brilliant but poorly-presented research every time -- but do not underestimate the role of dumb luck. For every awesome research problem that turns out to be tractable, there are many that just don't pan out.<p>There's a story I heard about Feynman. They say that Feynman used to take on grad students, and they would ask him what to work on. Feynman dreaded these questions. If he told a student to work on Interesting Problem X, and (s)he labored on it for years, only to find that it was intractable and therefore ultimately uninteresting after all, he was afraid the student would be terribly depressed, as depressed as only a late-term Ph.D. student can be. The story was that Feynman would tell the students to come back in a day or two, then take a problem and frantically work it out as fast and as far as he could in a day, trying to get a few years ahead of the student in a few hours, far enough ahead that he could be confident that an answer was likely to exist. Then he'd hide all his notes and present the problem to the student as an interesting and novel new idea.<p>Unfortunately, if you aren't a theorist, and your adviser isn't quite as smart, conscientious, and downright devious as Richard Feynman was, you'll be a normal grad student: You'll work away on a problem, and maybe it will be exciting, and maybe it will be boring, and the odds are on <i>boring</i>. [1] The secret is not to worry about this. If you want a successful research career, just <i>keep moving</i> from problem to problem: Finish your thesis (yes, with a stapler if you have to -- when you gotta finish, you gotta finish) and then devote your postdocs to finding a <i>better</i> problem, using all those Hamming-inspired skills you've been working on.<p>---<p>[1] One truism: By the time you finish your thesis <i>you are likely to be so bored with your own project that you will want to scream</i>. Even if your project, properly presented, is actually pretty exciting to the independent observer. You lose perspective in your fifth or sixth year. That's why it's more important to keep moving than to hold out for the <i>perfect</i> project, or the <i>golden</i> dissertation.",1266593055

  - ""All Lists"" area doesn't show percentage done easily.  Make it a visual graph with a percentage value.

1137074,comment,1136643,1136964,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Or do you seriously believe that the government should have the right to violate people's privacy based on their political leanings?<p>I'm not the original poster, but something to think about - communism isn't a political leaning the way debating about state/federal powers is a political leaning. Mainstream communist literature - Communist Manifesto for instance - directly advocates violence and rioting, to the end of placing the state under control of the workers. Marx said that condition - control by the workers - would be socialism. Socialism could then slowly dissolve until it's a classless, peaceful society, but Marx said you'd need to make a lot of violence on the bourgeois first.<p>I don't know, if there was a group that advocated, for instance, that they should confiscate and destroy all the property of non-Caucasians, make sure whites control everything, but that's only a necessary step to a perfectly peaceful and equal society - well, would you want the FBI to keep tabs on those people? How about if someone believed that they should kill all infidels to place society under the control of Muslims, which would then lead to a peaceful society? No, Communism isn't a political leaning, it's a very bad thing that's done very bad things.<p>I'm visiting Cambodia in two weeks by the way, I'm going to see the relic of one of the most literal applications of Marxist communist doctrines:<p>> People were often encouraged to confess to Angkar their ""pre-revolutionary lifestyles and crimes"" (which usually included some kind of free-market activity, or having had contact with a foreign source, such as a US missionary, or international relief or government agency, or contact with any foreigner or with the outside world at all), being told that Angkar would forgive them and ""wipe the slate clean"". This meant being taken away to a place such as Tuol Sleng or Choeung Ek for torture and/or execution.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields#Process"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields#Process</a><p>Communism is a bad thing. The legality/criminality of advocating it should be equivalent to the legality/criminality of other forms of advocating violence and destruction.",1266592228

There is a fundamental difference between the government spying on citizens or abusing the information they collect, and companies doing so. People voluntarily sign onto Facebook every day, and the company does <i>not</i> violate its privacy policy (if it did, you'd have grounds for a law suit). If Facebook users find its privacy policy acceptable, I don't think establishing contrarian laws is a proper response. It's not the government's place to institute laws to protect consumers from themselves. I don't believe Facebook abuses the customer's trust (and there are already contract laws against such things). The proper action here is educating people about privacy, not adding more legislation.",1266592104

1137058,comment,1136261,1136261,0,0,matrix,,,"I would rate this article as very basic at best. I became very interested in fashion after I needed to learn about it (long story). One thing you'll see a lot of -- and this article is guilty of this too -- is that clothes should fit well. Duh. The thing is, it's very rarely explained what that actually means. Part of the reason is that a lot of people writing these things simply don't know, beyond a few basics (listen to a tailor or a fashion designer who understands drape, etc). The other part is that the definition of ""good fit"" changes with time. Currently, the trend for mens fashion is for slim fitting garments. In two years that might change.<p>Dressing well is not about wearing certain types of prescriptive clothing (""thou shalt wear a slim-fitting button-down oxford, slim chinos, and expensive longwings"") but rather, is about dressing appropriately for the context, and choosing your clothes with a little care. This means fit, but it also means making sure the colors and patterns work well together (I can expand on this topic a bit more if anyone is interested).",1266591908

All one needs is to find vulnerabilities is smart people (and maybe a lot of computing resources to brute force fuzz a lot of software).

For example, you can type &quot;gcc --pricing&quot; to get the amount you owe from compiling all those continuous integration deployments.<p>&quot;GNU is sitting on a hundred billion dollar opportunity, and I&#x27;m really excited they are capitalizing on it.&quot;\n-Sam Altman, YCombinator<p>Thanks very much to all of our current contributers that have made this step possible. If it weren&#x27;t for the hard work of you, we wouldn&#x27;t be able have such an incredible position in the market and rich go-to-market strategy. As part of this fundrasing, we will be setting aside 10% of the investment to give back to the community that have made us so very, very happy.<p>&quot;They got embedded in all the huge enterprise companies on the backs of volunteers! Now they can flip on the revenue stream. I really respect Richard for his cutthroat business strategy.&quot;\n-Larry Ellison, Oracle<p>Unfortunately, some long time friends in the Linux community will not be joining us in our journey, namely the Linux kernel, so we will be using $50 million from this funding to complete the GNU Hurd kernel on an accelerated timeline so that our current users don&#x27;t experience any interruption of service.<p>------<p><a href=""https://diafygi.github.io/gnu-pricing/website/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://diafygi.github.io/gnu-pricing/website/</a>",1431301975

9521957,comment,9521015,9521835,0,0,to3m,,,"Semi-autonomous road trains, assuming - and I admit this isn&#x27;t a minor thing ;) - only the lead lorry need be occupied, would let you get more lorry-hours per driver hour. This might not actually improve the driver:lorry ratio, but by spreading one driver over multiple lorries you could operate the lorries in shifts with that same ratio.<p>Say currently one driver can drive 8 hours per day. So if you need to drive for 24 hours, it&#x27;s going to take 3 days. If you had 3 lorries doing that journey, it would take 3 days.<p>But say you had your semi-autonomous road train. Now you could do the journey in 24 hours. One driver drives for 8 hours, then the next guy, then the next guy. The two lorries behind just tag along.<p>Imagine 3 x 25 hour journeys, where the destinations didn&#x27;t quite match. Previously this would take 4 days. This time: there&#x27;s 24 hours of shared journey and an extra unshared hour of travel at the end of the route. Now your drivers have to split up at that point. The guy who was driving the road train last will have to wait 16 hours, so his journey takes 24+17 = 41 hours; the guy who was driving before him will have to wait 8 hours, so his journey takes 24+9 = 33 hours; the other guy can jump in his lorry and go straight away, so his journey takes 25 hours.",1431301887

9521951,comment,9516478,9521579,0,0,tagrun,,,"> If you take Mathematica&#x27;s/your polynomial and do that with it, you get an infinitely large relative error at 1 because log(1)=0 but your approx_log(1) is not 0.<p>So what?<p>Instead of accepting that his polynomial is more erroneous, you are steering this whole discussion in a totally synthetic direction.<p>Essentially your whole argument is <i>global</i> relative minimax error must be finite at every single point in the domain.<p>I don&#x27;t know where you got this idea/mantra but the point here is to have a rough and fast sketch with small overall error in applications, not mathematical rigor, which you can&#x27;t have with a 2nd degree polynomial anyway. His polynomials give inifintely huge L^1 and L^2 errors near origin; the minimax is finite (1) but it doesn&#x27;t make an infinitely big error OK. Which is why such simple minded mantras are wrong and bound to fail.<p>While minimax is the only thing that gets mentioned there, the world is a bigger place. There are many error measures. The concept of minimax approximation breaks down at the points where the function is 0 (you can have any arbitrary small number and we&#x27;re still doomed according to minimax) --this is not the end of the world, in many application, L^2 error (RMS) is more relevant, in which case Mathematica&#x27;s approximant is again 10 times better.<p>Do I want to make my errors 10 times larger over the <i>whole domain</i> and do I want a bumpy approximant just to make minimax happy at <i>one, single</i> point in the whole floating point range? No, thanks.<p>If we&#x27;re going to pick nits and be rigorous, his function fails big time at x=0 and x<0, and for x=\pm \infty as well as NaN. Now if this is a real concern, people just put a conditional there and live on happily. You can do that for x==1 case if this is a serious concern in your application ---even though it is very unlikely (this shouldn&#x27;t bother you since you&#x27;re OK with bumpy functions, and it&#x27;s going to be a small bump in this case anyway and still beats his polynomial by an order globally).<p>The whole point here is to have some rough sketch of log that works fast and yields small errors overall in the actual calculation. If I wanted rigor, I&#x27;d use libm log2 or <a href=""http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_log.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_log.c</a> which is also quite fast.<p>Understand this, relative flavor of minimax is some measure which is rarely directly relevant, and is hardly suited for log function. It&#x27;s not God&#x27;s absolute commandement and the requirements of domain specific rough approximants depend on the actual usage: whether the errors are going to end up being additive, multiplicative, etc.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not going to waste more time on this.\nHere are the unwavering facts since the beginning:\n1) His polynonimal has 10x worse relative error, and worse RMS error in the whole domain\n2) Your whole argument &quot;but what about x==1&quot; is wrongly placed since the approximant you have been fiercely defending here itself suffers from infinite pathological errors at x <= 0; if it bothers you so much nevertheless, just put an if(x==1) return 0, and there you go, I still have a 10x better function.",1431301783

9521942,comment,9521255,9521255,0,0,CthulhuOvermind,,,"Interesting to see this here. I did my masters thesis on this sdk the past September. We compared a neural network in native C to a CPU opencl implementation, and a FPGA implementation. The FPGA had about 8-10 times the kernel performance of a i7-2600k for the task. Interesting enough, what caused the jump in performance was the capability to have memory close to the kernel, with enough capacity to handle the kernel demands. The CPU was capped on what the ram-cpu bandwidth was, around 21gigs, however, the slower pci-e FPGA did not suffer, because of FPGA implemented memory could hold the necessary data at hand. Hence I sent the data to the kernel asynchronously, then a kernel with around 120 parallel implementations would operate and feed back the data through pci-e.<p>Having OpenCl certainly reduced dev time by around 85% id say. And that&#x27;s from someone fluent with verilog, who didn&#x27;t know openCL before doing this.",1431301554

For instance, Ronald Coase addressed this issue in an article called &quot;The Problem With Social Cost&quot;<p>> A candy maker had had the same property for over 60 years when a doctor moved next door.  After eight years passed without incident between them, the the doctor built a consulting room right against the confectioner’s kitchen.  The doctor then found that the noise from the confectioner’s equipment interfered with the doctor’s ability to work, and in particular to hear with a stethoscope.  The doctor filed suit to force the confectioner to stop using his equipment.  The court recognized that the confectioner might suffer some hardship – thus admitting to the reciprocal nature of harm that Coase would later recognize – but it argued that to avoid even greater (unspecified) individual hardship and inhibiting land development for residential use, the confectioner must stop<p>Coase proposed considering how the parties might settle the dispute in a market transaction once the court made its findings; for space reasons I will present a simplified version of Coase’s argument.  Though the doctor had won, in a market settlement he would be willing to allow the machinery to continue to operate were the confectioner to pay the doctor a sum that was greater than the doctor’s loss of income from having to either move or install sound abatement material.  Conversely, had the confectioner won, in a market settlement he would have been willing to accept payment from the doctor to stop using the noisy machinery if the amount were greater than the confectioner’s costs to move the equipment or install sound abatement material.<p>In difference with Pigou, for Coase the general principle in cases of damage is that each case should be considered for its particular circumstances: “When an economist is comparing alternative social arrangements, the proper procedure is to compare the total social product yielded by these different arrangements” [0]<p>I&#x27;m not saying one solution is perfect but I am just more open-minded as to how disputes are handled without the use (or threat) of force.

The fact that it is needed at all is already a failure of the OS.<p>And the Desktop app itself is sort of unstable, and classic shell is also sort of unstable, the combination result in lots of crashes, specially if you are having issues while trying to play some games (example: on my machine every time I scroll the map too much in Arcanum from Troika Games, it crashes, crashes the desktop, crashes the classic shell, and the mouse stops working completely... it is really amazing, it crashes so hard I am impressed instead of frustated).",1431299209

In the traditional market, the loops of funding things are more or less closed. If you want something you pay for it and therefore fund it. If it doesn&#x27;t get enough funding, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s priced incorrectly, or it&#x27;s not desired. The Free Software gift economy, for all its benefits in the area of user freedom, is entirely missing these price signals. See: Werner Koch.

Take welfare, for instance. Social welfare programs help the vulnerable, and undoubtedly some non-zero percentage of people are taking advantage of said programs wrongly. In the US, people who are liberal are more interested in the former, and people who are conservative are more interested in the latter.<p>This is a chief reason why one group is for it and the other is against it. It&#x27;s not that liberals don&#x27;t think welfare fraud exists at all, they just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big problem compared to the good such programs do. And it&#x27;s not that conservatives don&#x27;t think such programs do help some deserving poor people, they just hate the thought of some of their tax money going to someone mooching off the system.",1431298981

I do not hold any qualified education to argue for or against whether or not something like that is ever possible, but considering the heated debate back and forth, to me it seems as if it&#x27;s not about Soylent itself or anything, but rather about the whole principal idea.<p>I enjoy cooking and good food, and put some effort in what I eat and what I don&#x27;t eat, so I am not even personally interested let alone invested in this. Also the marketing speeches of Soylent fixing everything are outright laughable, but I can&#x27;t stop wondering the knee jerk reaction against the idea behind Soylent itself even.",1371149964

The vote is held, with everyone able to vote for one person on the list.  If there is a single winner (50%+1) then that person is declared the winner and the election if over.  If no-one gets a majority of the votes the top 2 candidates face off in a run-off election about 2 months later.<p>This allows everyone to vote for their preferred candidate in the general election without &#x27;wasting&#x27; their vote, but ensures that the eventual winner was chosen by at least 50% of their constituents.<p>There&#x27;s obviously some tweaks that can be made (for one, it doesn&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be non-partisan) but I think it does a very effective job at avoiding some of the party politics and the pandering to the base for the primary then moving to the center you see in many elections.",1371149192

This makes sense, because you can use this information to take action on their site, by either approving or denying the pull request.<p>The only use case for commit-commit diffs that I can think of, though, is if you plan on manually merging them and resolving conflicts, which you cannot do on Github (to my knowledge). There exist many graphical and command-line utilities that you can run on your machine, the same place you will be making those changes.<p>To me, Github&#x27;s two jobs are to host reposiitories, and to make it easy to find and view the repositories of others. They do both of these jobs very well, and this map plugin makes Github better at the second in at least some cases. Once it comes time to actually start changing things, though, I get off of Github, and work on the local copy I have with the tools on my machine. Replicating this functionality isn&#x27;t, to me, what Github is for.<p>As an aside, if there is a way to manually construct a url, there&#x27;s a shortcut to getting Github to add it to the UI. A few months ago, someone made a JavaScript bookmarklet to add a search bar to any repository, since the UI for this functionality was so clunky.

You could also argue that penalizing a child for what is unarguably random chance on the part of their parents is cruel and unusual, not to mention this would mean that the debt (licensing agreement) is essentially inherited by the child, which is illegal if not outright unconstitutional to my knowledge (i.e., unless the debt is under a joint card with the deceased, you cannot inherit their credit card debt, although the creditors get rights to part of the estate covering the debt).<p>Edit: Apparently Myriad patented more than just strands for the BRCA genes, including some methods and tests, which is one of the reasons their case is important to SCOTUS.

But to my understanding, you can share memory on KVM, but not diskspace (at least not easily), which is why every single KVM offers out there have very small disk allocation. This works great for DO, because they are offering SSD, and SSD VPS (regardless the type of VM) are small in size, so it fits perfectly.<p>I think the whole idea with VPS, is that you can share resources, so there is nothing wrong with that, its the overselling part that should be of concern and I have no reason to believe that DO is overselling. Their performance is pretty good.<p>The point I was trying to make referring to the OP, that VPS like DO can be profitable even at such a low price, because of the way VPS work. Even with very small revenue, if you have enough customer you can make good money. That&#x27;s why the math works. Most other KVM offerings are so expensive because they don&#x27;t have that tipping point scale to make them profitable with the same price.

5875764,comment,5875183,5875271,1,0,a3n,,,"But this one might. I&#x27;ve been thinking ...<p>One, it&#x27;s almost a given these days that any secret program will eventually be rumored, revealed or detailed. So to rely on a program being secret (and <i>how</i> many contractors have access to all this?) is to design a security regime that is destined to fail.<p>Once a program is rumored, it&#x27;s subject to possible question by Congress or others. In order to prolong the program&#x27;s secrecy, security officials must lie. Yet the program will eventually out, revealing those lies, and further eroding our trust in government. If they lied about that, they&#x27;re capable of lying about anything, by demonstration. The loss of trust is the most damaging result, since democracy depends on it.<p>Two, if a program is secret, generously funded, not subject to oversight (and if Congress can&#x27;t talk about it, then there isn&#x27;t any real oversight), that&#x27;s a rich, fetid environment for the growth of sloppy procedures, illegal activity, and just plain waste. And remember, these are government contracts run by government contractors who lobby. The program will do anything it can to sustain itself.<p>Now that Prism et al. are out, the cover is blown. One of the justifications given for secrecy is so that targets are not aware of the surveillance, and are comfortable communicating in an insecure way. Are they going to disband the program and send everyone home? No. Notwithstanding any foiled terrorist plots (and how can we believe <i>that</i>, they&#x27;re proven liars), the money has been largely wasted, and now the program that was designed to depend on secrecy will likely continue.<p>A better approach would be to assume the program will be revealed, and in fact reveal its existence openly in Congressional testimony. Keep secret what must be kept secret, like location of telecom vaults and other assets, but say what it is, what it does and what it&#x27;s for.<p>This is much harder, because you have to design a program that will be effective even when known. But it&#x27;s better, because its existence is acknowledged from the beginning, so citizens don&#x27;t suffer from exposure eruptions and lies, and we know what&#x27;s being done in our names to ourselves and everyone else. We even have some small chance of telling our representatives that we don&#x27;t like it and to ask them to stop it. And if it&#x27;s stopped, we have a small chance of believing that it really is stopped.<p>Any such program would likely be less sweeping than what&#x27;s being revealed, and so less subject to abuse, and less potentially wasteful. People in the program will have to work harder and more creatively to get results, and they&#x27;ll probably get better results.<p>If nothing else, the trend is not our friend, and if this kind of carte blanche isn&#x27;t stopped then we eventually will look more like East Germany and less like the myths we learned in civics class.",1371148418

I&#x27;d love to see a Java driver happen, and we&#x27;ll do everything we can to support such a project.",1371147996

(The lion is not scary if it doesn&#x27;t have teeth)<p>Pure proof would be the people that put others to test before acknowledging labels. You are authority because you ACTUALLY know the domain where you claim authority, you are authority because you care about the consequences of your decisions on the all people affected by them. I obey because I saw that you actually are better than me in the context, and pain has nothing to do with it.<p>Pure label people look at pure proof people as disorderly, rebellious, dis adjusted, and they don&#x27;t comply but hack their way around. The sense of comfort for pure label people comes from a well known establish order, and they feel that without authority society will spiral into chaos. Order is more important than people. I think they are correct.<p>Pure Proof people look at pure label people as sheep, drones, overly compliant people that are too lazy to try understand what actually works. The sense of comfort for pure proof people comes from objectively understanding the context, see how it is supposed to work regardless of the current implementation, and once an appropriate solution is found, then passionately support it. They feel that with excessive authority society will be for a few, hence just another form of chaos. People is more important than Order). I think they are correct.<p>(I know that for a dualistic mind agreeing with both is non sense... you will have to stretch your brain if you want to understand how this is possible and is OK)<p>This is an spectrum, so most people is in neither pole, but somewhere in between.<p>I believe that the truth in this case, is in the balance. And society to progress needs both. Our current society implementation massively favors Pure label people for historically or manipulative reasons, and to the point of almost looking at pure proof people as pathological.<p>Since the situation is out of balance, our current implementation of society 3.0 is faulty.

My immediate reaction is that for most practical applications, the Court&#x27;s holding means that even though the broadest possible biotechnology product claims (to the isolated DNA itself) aren&#x27;t going to be patentable, the key elements in making and using a biotechnology-based invention are still going to be protectable via patents (Part III of the Court&#x27;s opinion makes this especially clear).  This will allow researchers and competitors a little bit of wiggle room to design around biotechnology patents because they can use the basic isolated sequence but there will still be substantial limitations on what they can do with that isolated sequence.  For this reason, I&#x27;m skeptical that the Court&#x27;s opinion will have a negative effect on the incentives for creating biotechnology-based applications.  To the contrary: by affirming that cDNA can be patented, it may strengthen the incentives for investing in research in this area.&quot; (<a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2013/06/myriad-isolated-dna-out-cdna-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2013/06/myriad-isolated-dna-...</a>)",1371146774

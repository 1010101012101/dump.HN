His uncle wasn't making a specific claim against the theory of gravitation, but using gravity as an example of the ignorance of scientists as evidence against listening to their claims in general.  this kind of reasoning is common and dangerous.",1235339879

Capitalism relies on people's self-interest to ensure that each investor will invest in the opportunity that has the most value-creation potential with the lowest risk.<p>Investors, people ""managing money"", aren't just sitting on the sidelines cashing in on everyone else's good ideas. Their essential purpose is to move available capital to wherever it will produce the highest returns - i.e. wherever it will produce the most wealth.<p>The total wealth of a nation impacts the wealth of everyone in that nation.

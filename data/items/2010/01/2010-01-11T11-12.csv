The crux of the argument for peak oil, as I understand it, is not that we'll run out of oil but that extracting it will become quickly very expensive.  And building alternatives, as we already know, is very expensive.  So that we'll have a period of time where we'll have a dramatic decline in our standard of living.<p>It doesn't matter if we'll always have oil if very few people will use it.",1263211159

What would have taken 5 minutes in the pre-smd time took me a couple of hours and it was still sub-standard work.<p>Now I've been 'out' of electronics for a long time, almost 30 years now, but in a way I'm really happy. I'd hate to be an electronics hobbyist today, the state of the art has advanced so far that you're probably best off buying an FPGA kit and using that instead of rolling your own circuitry.<p>Arduino seems to capitalize on that feeling, to allow people to take a small step back from those black boxes and to open them up again.",1263210304

(And yes, I've listened to one of IBM's research scientists discuss this and when asked explicitly what they were up to with POWER6 and he basically they did it because they could, but they didn't see any future beyond that and overall they were going back to focus on parallelism like the POWER architecture had in the previous designs.)<p>> I too have written multithreaded code, and decided the solution was to stop writing multithreaded code.<p>Amen.<p>But again, I don't think that's viable.  We need some way to use multi-threads somehow to get the performance we need in future programs.

What makes something ""dogma"" is <i>ignorant</i> adoption of a view point or preference and then blindly parroting it and actively demonizing people who choose other tools.<p>The best programmers (the subset we are talking about) don't blindly adopt (or maintain) their preference for  a specific language out of ignorance. Linus Torvalds, for example, has a very strong anti C++ bias [1]. That doesn't make him not part of   the set of ""best programmers"".<p>Again I agree with your  larger point of  going around bashing other people because they have different tastes from yours being an <i>unproductive</i> exercise.<p>""I would hate to program in PHP (or even, I think PHP sucks as a programming language because of reasons x y z) and would much prefer to use Python (or arc or whatever) "" is very different from ""People who use PHP are idiots and should be burned at the stake"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643/focus=57918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57643...</a>",1263208502

The thing that makes Facebook different from MySpace, text messages different from push email, isn't technical, it's all in how users <i>think</i> about what they're doing.<p>> There is no ""public, status-seeking"" mindset to web based email that is missing with desktop email.<p>There <i>is</i> a public, status-seeking mindset <i>inherent</i> in using email—that's why it works so well on the web. It's actually kind of useless to make it a desktop application; it's just a historical accident that it was first incarnated through the desktop metaphor at all.<p>> Why should the developer care at all about these?<p>The point is to <i>hide</i> the fact that the user is using a website, because the user has certain connotations about web sites that he or she doesn't have about desktop applications, even if those desktop applications happen to render HTML over HTTP under the hood. The user should be able to download a desktop application and not <i>know</i> that there's a web application sitting at a URL somewhere that it's just accessing and displaying.<p>For a perfect example of this, look at the iTunes Music Store. It's all HTML—but would it feel the same if you accessed it as a website, rather than through iTunes? People trust iTunes with their credit card information more readily than they trust a website. People are more willing to click a ""Buy"" button in a desktop app than a website. There are usability studies that prove both of these things. Again, it's about how the user thinks about your service—and by using Fluid or Prism on the <i>developer's</i> side to package your service as a desktop app, you can <i>change</i> how the user thinks about your service, without having to change how your service works internally.",1263208287

We tell our recruiters to put job descriptions out for ""Software Engineers"" versus ""Flash Developers"" and ""PHP Developers"".<p>For us, it's rare to find someone with both PHP and Flash experience.  Heck, most of the senior devs have less than 2 years experience using both at the same time.  So, instead, we look for really smart programmers with solid software engineering fundamentals since we figure that it's much easier to teach a smart person a new language than try to teach someone core CS concepts.<p>We've seen this work fairly well with several new hires.  The language is, like you said, just a medium and changes depending on the project.  The real challenge comes from understanding how to architect code in a way that's flexible/scalable/maintainable.",1263208199

It'd just be in those languages.<p>Some people will always whine and moan about any language, but in every case there's a work around for any dislike they have.

What I meant with agnostic is that it is a point of personal preference, not dogmatic. I'm not sure which word fits better there than agnostic.<p>> f this were true, PG could have written HN in PHP.

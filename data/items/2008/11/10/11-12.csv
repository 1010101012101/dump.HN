359131,comment,359041,359041,0,0,peanutsmum,,,"if going to bed at the same time / getting up at the same times works, then you're probably lucky to not have such an extreme disorder. I've tried this and it doesn't work for me, the only solution has been to change my life so it fits more around my condition. This is through a combination of - 1 part time job, 1 teaching job and a number of freelance jobs. \nFreelancing is probably your best option as you can work from home at hours that suit you, the best way to get freelance work is via direct contacts, get yourself a linkedin profile & your own website (if you don't already) and get networking. Most of my freelance work comes from word of mouth, so make sure as many people as possible know what you do & that you're available. \nContracting is an option, as you could deal with the sleep deprivation for a couple of months, then take a couple of weeks off - there's loads of agencies about, just make sure you 'sell' yourself to them with a really great CV.\nAlternatively, do some research and find a company that promotes more progressive working styles, I worked at one small agency which allowed people to work from home if they chose, or work shifts at the office that suited them. \nDon't give up hope, it's not your fault you have this condition, and if workplaces' could be more flexible it would be better for everyone that's currently excluded (i.e. people with disabilities, single parents, etc).",1226318233

359118,comment,359041,359041,0,0,a2dam,,,"I have this exact condition and am in a very similar boat. Two things helped me a great deal: medication and training. The training I am sure you've heard before, and if it worked by itself you wouldn't have this problem. I've found that a combination of Provigil (an anti-narcolepsy drug) and Strattera (a non-stimulant ADD drug that has the side effect of early awakening) helps a tremendous amount. Throw in some Ambien once or twice a week, and I'm able to edit my sleep cycle to be much more in line with normal work hours.<p>There are those who say this is excessive.

In GMail's terms it says they will hand over the account to the next of kin if you send them the death certificate, or if you have power of attorney over that person. Yahoo won't give access under any circumstances, although that's obviously over-ridden by the court's decision.<p>I found out about this was thinking about social media sites and how they're affected by death recently, which I did as a BarCamp talk and wrote up here:<p><a href=""http://www.paulsilver.co.uk/blog/2008/10/death-and-social-media/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulsilver.co.uk/blog/2008/10/death-and-social-me...</a><p>I think there's stuff that should be in web applications that we miss because we don't think about death, i.e. should we have an extra e-mail for the next of kin of a user?

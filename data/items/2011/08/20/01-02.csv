But because it is so hard, an important task for any programmer is to know their limitations and work around their limitations - master the skill of software engineering.<p>Just consider, the things that ""only a few people can do"", like playing 2800 chess, are turning out to be what a computer can more easily accomplish. Whereas the things ""any idiot can do"", like speaking English, are turning out to the things that computers have a really hard time doing.<p>In this sense, if programming is a ""humanistic"" field, it seems like many people and kinds of people can achieve excellence in it. But naturally this depends on what an organization cultivates.",1313805282

It sounds like they're planning to license it, I guess, if they can.</i><p>You know, back in the day everybody and his dog was telling Apple to license MacOS (I mean OS 7-9, not OS X). Apple supporters would tirelessly explain that turning MacOS into a commodity OS would make it neither fish nor fowl: It wouldnt have the reach of Windows nor would it have the seamless integration of an Apple-only product. There was a brief and half-hearted attempt to license it which only cannibalized Apples existing sales. Steve killed it the moment he returned as CEO.<p>Now HP has declared that despite being a dominant manufacturer of PCs, it cannot win in the personal computing business and it has no marketing muscle nor manufacturing chops to succeed and make money in the phone or tablet businesses.<p>Only everyone talks about how great their OS is. This sounds exactly like Apple when they were all but acquired by NeXT in a reverse takeover. Only instead of doubling down on their manufacturing and marketing like Apple did, theyre exiting the business and licensing their OS. I am not going to predict that they will fail, but I am going to say it will be interesting to see what happens with licensing and to compare it (if only for entertainment purposes) with what happened with Apple.",1313805103

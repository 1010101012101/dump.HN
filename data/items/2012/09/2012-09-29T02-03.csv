4588712,comment,4584631,4587174,3,0,ivan_ah,,,"> if you want widespread adoption, you need to target a course.<p>You may be right about that, but I think there is also value in a single book which covers all these subjects in an integrated manner. Especially Calculus and Physics, which are very co-dependent.<p>Imagine the use case of someone who wants to learn science on their own. Perhaps he/she is taking an online course which has calculus, physics and linear algebra as prerequisites. Traditionally this would mean he/she has to get three different textbooks (400+ pages each) and slog through all that material. There are excellent free books out there on all of these subjects so money will not be an issue, but going through 1200+ pages will be very time consuming.<p>This is the gap I want to fill: (1) textbook for self-learners, (2) add-on material for a university class, (3) reference book for adults who want to review the material they learned while at uni.<p>For audiences (1) and (3) having an 5-in-1 product is definitely a good thing. For audience (2) having all the extra material might make my book appear off-topic and decrease interest. In the next iteration, I am going to think about splitting the narrative to make books for individual subjects to cater more to (2).",1348887505

Realistically, if your game is good enough to make $1, it will probably make more than one dollar, but the goal of the October challenge is to finish a game that is good enough that you want to sell it. I'd argue that the emphasis is finishing and polishing vs. LD48's emphasis on game rapid creation and innovation.  In either case if you want to have an inclusive community that also emphasizes learning and experimentation, you can't apply an arbitrary quality bar to entries, it's just not in the spirit of the jam.

4588638,comment,4586581,4588513,8,0,chipsy,,,"I had a similar experience to yours -- when I was in college. LD was run on an infrequent basis then. I participated in two, as well as some student-run ones, and figured, ""ah, I think I've done enough jams, I should do bigger games. These little ones aren't serious, they aren't what I want to be doing.""<p>Years later, LD started getting run more frequently and got more popular. Remembering having a good time with it previously, I participated again and put in a lot of effort, thinking I could crush it with more experience, and soon realized I was wrong about both my experience and my prior perspective. Here's what I realized:<p>- Most of the time I spend on a big project is spent on learning something specific to that project. Minimizing the schedule means that I only learn things necessary towards finishing. This is not an easily dismissed skillset. It isn't the <i>only</i> skill, but it's your most easily  monetized one.<p>- Tangibility is really really important towards motivating future work. This is why prototyping software is worthwhile in the first place. When it's finished, you have a reference, one which you own and probably understand better than anyone else. The reference isn't the code(which is probably butchered) or the assets(which are necessarily cheap) but in the possibilities suggested for future improvement.<p>- Prototyping - and creation itself - is a fractal endeavor. Each time you build a new feature, you have to do the same kind of work that goes into a game jam in order to prove and flesh out its capabilities. This is repeated the whole way up the ladder, until the project is complete. At each step you can prototype until you hit tangibility, polish it a bit, then move on to the next feature, etc.<p>While I agree that of 1000 entries, most are going to be half-baked, that's kind of the point. You're being encouraged to go in and pick up the experience of <i>every</i> stage of the project, so that when you want to expand scope, it's not hard or surprising, it just involves more learning and specialization.<p>As well, it helps you in identifying bad, unmarketable ideas faster, which is the real problem that plagues game developers - a lot of time and money sunk into something that could never sell.",1348884932

The same criticism could be leveled against... any system where a requestor can allocate memory and stall a handler that is independent of the incoming request loop.  How would this be different in a different concurrency model?<p>>Space is almost never a reason to use coroutines over threads.<p>I wouldn't necessarily say so.  I have a polling service that uses a few thousand standing goroutines.  The memory overhead for each individual goroutine is so low that I can just spawn them casually.  Each goroutine only actually does work for a few seconds every few minutes;  the vast majority of the time, each goroutine is spent sleeping.  For this type of problem, I find that organizing things with goroutines and channels makes my code very easy to reason about.  That, to me, is the biggest win of Go's concurrency model; that it's very easy to reason about.",1348884913

That means they're legally the sole copyright holders for all software they distribute. The official reason for this is so they can pursue GPL violations in court without involving the actual authors of the code. It also permits them to change the license on any of their software.

Jacob and I love seeing people as excited about the future of Bootstrap as us. We're hopeful that this is just the beginning of it. And now, onto answering some of the questions/comments folks have brought up here thus far.<p>Jacob left over a month ago and my last day is next Friday (10/5). He's going to Obvious, and (announcing it here for the first time) I'm going to GitHub.<p>The timing has nothing to do with a disagreement about Bootstrap (seriously, none what so ever), and more to do with us both wanting a change in our own lives for what we do day-to-day. Twitter, the company and product, are both amazing and Jacob and I have worked there for 2.5 years. We're stoked for our next things and we both want to keep working on Bootstrap no matter what. We have an obligation to the community and know it could go much further. (Oh, and yes, I screwed up the date on the post. My bad, yo.)<p>Bootstrap was created by me at Twitter as a means to make better looking internal tools (I wrote about this on A List Apart awhile back: <a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/articles/building-twitter-bootstrap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/building-twitter-bootstra...</a>). It started off as a simple HTML/CSS thing, then Jacob built plugins on top of it, and we open sourced it together. We made it at Twitter, so when we wanted to open source it, we went to Twitter to ensure it was good to go. Thus, it was named Twitter Bootstrap (originally, ""Bootstrap, from Twitter"" actually). Now, it's back to just ""Bootstrap"".<p>We don't really think of it as the next jQuery, Django, or Drupal. But you can't deny there is something to front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, and that's what we're excited about. HTML and CSS are the two easiest and most basic building blocks of websites. Everyone knows and uses them, and that's a big part of why Bootstrap has grown so much, and can continue to grow more.<p>No, we weren't ""given time"" to work on Bootstrap, but that's because it was a project I started on my own to help other engineers. Jacob came in to shape it into a proper open source project and then wrote all the JavaScript plugins (Fun fact: before the jQuery plugins, he wrote a MooTools library on top of it called Tit, which <i>is</i> a type of bird). Anyway, we weren't given time because it wasn't a company priority, naturally, and we're okay with that. We worked on it, at the office or at home, whenever we wanted and folks were generally okay with that as well.<p>The move to making Bootstrap its own project and organization is a joint one, between myself, Jacob, and Twitter's Open Source team (@cra). The transition will take time, but we need to grow Bootstrap beyond the two of us and Twitter, and into something more. There is really <i>sooooo</i> much potential for making better things on the Web, and we're hoping we can keep that up with the help of the community.<p>Anyway, we're both stoked to keep working on Bootstrap. It's a great project that can be so much better, and that's pretty damned awesome to us. Twitter has been amazing for both of us and will continue to down the road. We wish nothing but the best for everyone we've worked with.<p><3",1348884101

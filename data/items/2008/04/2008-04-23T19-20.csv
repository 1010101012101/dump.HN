You will learn a lot about how meaningless Twitter is once you disconnect from email/phone/internet/tv/radio for a week and feel incredibly liberated. If you want to find an idea that will change the world, disconnect from it all for a short period. When you come back the first thing you will do is cancel your Twitter, aim, etc and the next thing you will do is start doing something meaningful to more people than just those who are plugged into the net 24 hours a day.",1208979605

Something's weird there. Admittedly, it used to be quite high (116, <i>nervous chuckle</i>), but nowadays it hovers below WordPress' query count.<p>I don't know where you're getting that whole admin authentication thing from. Nowhere in the code does it do anything <i>remotely</i> similar to what you said. The cookies simply hold the browsing user's ID and md5ed password (the md5 is the only information on the password that is stored), which is then authenticated. It's not a username and password for the admin area. It's just the information of the user who's logged in. Nothing new.<p>There's no single ""is_admin"" check or anything of the sort. There's no ""authentication to the admin"". It's not an all-powerful section that checks for a single thing before giving you access to every function. The group that the browsing user is associated with must have the proper privileges to perform the various functionality that is checked throughout the administration section.<p>As for using salts on the md5 encryptions, I don't see anywhere in WordPress's code does that either (I just downloaded the latest copy). I might add it in to 2.0, though. Should be a fairly easy change.<p>If you want the software to improve (which doesn't exactly seem to be the case), I just think you should either file tickets or confront the developer (me, and a couple contributors in the IRC channel) instead of spouting off misinformation on other sites.",1208979521

It's easy to make a small, sustainable business in some areas, especially service businesses. If you get certified and get a union card, you can hang out your shingle as a plumber or electrician, and odds are you'll make plenty of money, but you have no hope of getting super rich.<p>As a plumber, there really isn't any technology on the horizon that is any obvious threat to make your job redundant, and people in India will never take your job. You are creating wealth, just not a ton of it.<p>This kind of business may be harder to make sustainable in the internet technology industry, but as 37 Signals has demonstrated, it's certainly not impossible.",1208979322

Please tell me how to get one"" , though I don't mind if you answer it that way - ""plus internet"" is a very interesting direction. Thank you.<p>I was asking ""How did <i>you</i> get <i>your</i> startup ideas?""  which is a little different.<p>Some context.  I  was reading some books (Christiansen's ""Innovator's Solution"" and de Bono's ""Serious Creativity"" - I am a developer but I do read a business book once in a while! :-)  )  which seem to advocate a deliberate, methodical  approach to idea generation.<p><pre><code> I wondered how startup  founders (especially the YC folks) generate their ideas.\n</code></pre>\nHence the  (original) question , trying to tap the experience of people reading this. Over the last couple of days I heard some debate on on whether creating an idea first and then gathering co founders is better than the other way round so I added that.<p>\nApologies for any errors in phrasing. English is not my first language.",1193734288

For DabbleDB we rolled our own OODB because the GemStone licensing was too steep, but they're loosening that up and I'd take a serious look at it if I were starting something new.",1193733334

ObjectStore, GemStone, etc.<p>I think these systems really only make sense in the telecommunications, CAD, etc. niches where performance is critical. <p>That said, the new trend in DB systems are main memory relational systems based on column store architectures (vs. traditional row store). The performance of such architectures is really quite promising. Go to Stonebreaker's talk at the latest VLDB in Viena.<p>Or take a look at his new company:<p><a href=""http://www.streambase.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.streambase.com/</a>\n",1193733012

Lend them an empathic ear, then take their pain/talent/idea and add the internet.<p>Let me give you an example.  I met a musician the other day.  He's got a kid now, and he said that most of the energy he formerly put into improvisational music now goes into improvisational storytelling; every night, he makes up a bedtime story with his kid.  He said he was thinking about recording these stories for sentimental reasons.<p>Since I DO have an unhealthy obsession with the internet, my first thought was, ""hm, ok, recorded stories <i>plus internet</i> equals ...?""  That is, what if you had LOTS of families recording these stories and you managed to get all that data into one system.  It doesn't <i>quite</i> work with bedtime stories -- I think those tend to be a little too personal to be of general appeal -- but there are plenty of very talented storytellers out there... there are local societies and whatnot.  It's a tradition that dates back to the beginning of language.  Why not create a Youtube-like environment where people with a passion for storytelling can share their stories with each other and the world?  This guy I was chatting with said he'd never have thought of that, but you could see the wheels turning in his head as soon as I mentioned it.<p>So let's say you've gotten this far.  At this point, if your goal is to create something cool that could change the lives of a group of people, you're all set.  (I bet this story idea could turn into a cool folk-art community.)  But if your goal is to turn it into a startup, there's one more step... you need to apply this filter: ""ok, interesting idea, but is this a <i>business</i>?""<p>Point is, a good place to start is to get outside the YC/TechCrunch echo chamber and talk to people who have good ideas and painful frustrations but <i>don't</i> automatically think ""ok... plus internet?""",1193732784

Nobody wants to actually come out and say that Wolfram is nuts, but people are treating him that way -- metaphorically speaking, smiling and nodding politely while backing away slowly.  Keep in mind that this is a culture where the quality of one's mind is all-important, so accusing someone of being crazy is the worst possible insult.<p>Maybe it will turn out that Wolfram has been right all along -- but until and unless that happens, I think it's good that people who make wild and utterly unsupported claims are met with great skepticism.\n",1193731241

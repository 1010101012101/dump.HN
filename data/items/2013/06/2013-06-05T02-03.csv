This sort of unqualified assertion may lead people to believe Go's questionable design decisions were, in fact, made out of ignorance.<p>A language with null references is exactly like a language with option types, where every reference value is by default optional.<p>Removing this default does not increase complexity for the user.  Conversely, it allows the user to write less code and enjoy more safety, which is clearly a complexity decrease.",1370401148

Since everybody gets the deduction it just causes everyone to have to bid that much more in order to be the highest offer. And the higher prices don't really spur new home construction to compensate as you might expect, because the areas with high demand are largely urban areas with minimal available undeveloped land and zoning regulations that often prohibit the construction of higher density housing that would relieve pricing pressure.

All these games have entries at BoardGameGeek.com. There are reviews there and/or video reviews/playthroughs to get a feel for them.<p>Anyway, here we go:<p>Main Games<p>==========<p><i>7 Wonders</i> -- on the lighter end, this one goes over well -- it's a gateway game, possibly the Catan of our time. All types of gamers are open to playing it. The game plays 7 (I think 8 with an expansion) and games can be played in 30 - 40 minutes each, so you can find yourself playing 3 games back-to-back. There are 2 or 3 official expansions to keep it fresh. Probably worth having in the collection.<p><i>Lords of Waterdeep</i>: another lighter game which is a popular D&D-themed worker-placement game.<p><i>Dominion</i>: perhaps a little bit more complex, but not by very much; it's a modern classic which popularized the deck-building mechanic. It's all about looking at a tableau of cards available for use during the game and figuring out which combos will enable one to succeed -- analytical types tend to be good at this. It has a lot of expansions (people shy away from the small ones and go for Intrigue, Prosperity and perhaps the newest/last, Dark Ages) and can play up to 6 or so.<p><i>Agricola</i>: a classic worker-placement game that adds a bit of Dominion-like thinking about creating good card-combos. It has a lot of replay value -- and there are various expansion decks, etc. to add variety. It plays up to 5. It takes a bit of getting into though -- there's a learning curve to understand the various card-combinations in addition to learning which actions to take when.<p>For some people, this game is something of a cult.<p>Other more games that have been very popular lately include:<p><i>Tzolk'in</i>: a recently-published ingeniously-fashioned worker-placement game with interlocking gears on the board that represent the movement of time (tzolk'in is the name of the Mayan calendar and the game came out in 2012, when that was in the news). You put your workers on the gears and the longer you leave them, the better stuff they'll be able to get or do. But you don't have many, so you'll need to pull them off in order to put them elsewhere. People are drawn to this one.<p><i>Battlestar Galactica</i> -- a cooperative game with a traitor mechanic -- you're trying to get to Caprica but one or more players may be a Cylon. There's a lot of player interaction and it's tense. There are people addicted to this one. It has 2 expansions.<p><i>Space Alert</i>: a very social game where you are trying to run a spaceship with the other players while various threats are coming in -- you talk through what you want everyone to do but play your action-cards face down and then, after the mission's 10 minutes are up (there are soundtracks for them, announcing where various threats show up, etc.), everyone reveals their action cards and you get to see if everyone did what they planned to do at the proper time or if your ship dies because someone didn't get power to the laser cannon when you were trying to fire it or didn't get to the ship's computer to jiggle the mouse to make the screensaver go away...it's a fun, humorous game and it has an expansion to add playability.<p><i>Galaxy Trucker</i>: by the same designer as <i>Space Alert</i>, you quickly build ships by turning over and choosing tiles for various components while a sand timer is trickling. Then you send your ships out into space where they will encounter various threats and opportunities. The threats can damage the ship, leading to small--or very large--pieces of it coming off. There are expansions.<p><i>Race for the Galaxy</i>, as suggested by someone else, is very good.

It works. And there are expansions/variants.<p><i>Munchkin</i>: a small Steve Jackson Games game which is very popular and has a ton of expansions -- it keeps SJG afloat -- but some people loathe it.<p>There are some dice games like <i>Martian Dice</i> and the very different <i>Liar's Dice</i> which also might work.<p>Again, I think these are games that are well-known in gaming circles and so good for starting off with.<p>Buying Games<p>============<p>As far as buying games go, the online stores offer the best pricing -- two that many people like are coolstuffinc.com and miniaturemarket.com -- in addition to low pricing, you get free shipping at $100 or so and they each have a reward system, so you get subsequent discounts.<p>Or you might want to find and patronize your friendly local game store (FLGS), but most of them charge full retail, which can be 30% (i.e. $10 - $30) more.<p>I hope all this helps and happy gaming.",1370400130

And remember, what seems easy in one little blog post isn't easy in a real program where you've got dozens of the little buggers flying every which way.

5823278,comment,5819701,5821903,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"The point is that it matters very much to a dealership and <i>they</i> see a significant difference between the two.<p>Dealer staff aren't usually trying to look at <i>overall</i> expenses--that's for the accountants to bother with--but the profit/loss per vehicle. This is enforced by nearly everyone's income (on the sales and finance side of the business) being determined on a per-sale basis.<p>Simplistically, each car on the lot represents a loan. The longer it sits there, the higher the fees & interest paid. Dealers want to move each unit as quickly as possible to keep the repayment fees as low as possible, and to prevent eating up dealer holdback, floorplan assistance, and other incentives. Nearly all of these are calculated on a per-car basis. If it did not matter to dealers, they (and their salespeople) would not know how long the cars stay on the lot--because it directly tells them how much money they're losing per day on that vehicle. Moreover, nearly every salesperson and manager at the dealership know <i>exactly</i> which cars are the oldest cars on the lot, <i>in rough (if not exact) order of age</i>.<p>The various ways dealers make money--holdbacks, incentives, rebates, floorplan assistance, inflated MSRPs, documentation fees, etc.--all exist to offset the expected costs of doing business--floorplans, commissions, taxes, regulatory fees, etc.<p>When Car A hits the lot on Day N, the dealer is sitting on 100% profitability from the sale (let's just assume 0 haggling & they get sticker price + all their fees, etc.). Each day the car sits on the lot, they drop further from 100%. The dealer and salespeople are highly incentivized to sell for as close to 100% as they can.<p>Beyond that, a dealer is in a very unhappy position when the cost of having Car B on the lot is high enough that it begins decreasing the profitability of other cars sold. How does occur? In simplest terms: Car B is on the lot long enough that it's actually eaten through all the cash assistance available to the dealer for Car B, and is now eating through the cash available on Car A.<p>Let's say the dealer loses 1% profit per day on the lot. It takes 100 days to reach 0, obviously. On day 101, the dealer is now at -1% profit, and that has to come from another car on the lot. It's not unheard of for a car to be on the lot for 300-400 days. I've rarely seen much over 400, but it happens (especially with oddly configured models). In our simple, imaginary scenario, that 400-day-old car has eaten through not only its own profit, but that of 3 other cars.<p>When you arrive on Day N and Car B has already been there for 100 days, the dealer is significantly further from 100%, and is going to be more willing to bend further to move Car B than s/he is to move Car A, which is sitting on 100%, and whose profit the dealer is strongly interested in preserving.<p>There are further factors often at play here, as well. Say you are a Sales Manager at the dealership. You have a salary, but on top of that, let's suppose you are paid bonuses based not only on number of cars sold (like salespeople), but also on average days-on-the-lot. The better you are at moving your inventory, the more you make. Have a few cars sitting on the lot significantly longer than the others? Well, now your bonus is fucked up.<p>The longer a car has been sitting on the lot, the higher your possible chances of working out a better deal purchasing that car. Once a car hits a certain age on the lot, the dealers may even dip into their holdback and other assistance dollars to get the thing moved.<p>Note: I am not attempting to suggest that the dealers are behaving entirely rationally. I'm just pointing out that these things matter to dealers, who typically look at everything on a profitability-per-car basis.<p>Disclosure: I know enough about bonuses from selling the oldest cars on the lot to feel confident in saying that lot age matters very much to dealers in a number of ways--enough so that they're willing to pay a salesperson more to sell the 400-day-old car than the 20-day-old car. It matters. The 20-day-old car might make you $300. The 400-day-old car could make you $1,000. When John and Jane Doe walk on to the lot to find their new sedan and you have <i>almost</i> exactly what they're looking for in a 400-day-old model and exactly what they're looking for in a 20-day-old model, which one do you suppose you will try to sell them?",1370398262

5823260,comment,5823029,5823029,26,0,nhashem,,,"As a resident of Los Angeles, this seems anecdotally (which has the usual caveats) obvious to me.  I saw home ownership lead to issues with employment <i>within the Los Angeles metropolitan area.</i><p>There is a lot of ""affordable"" ($400K to $600K) single family homes in the San Fernando Valley, or towards Orange County, so I had a lot of coworkers buy homes in those areas.  If you work in Venice, a house in Torrance is about a 45 minute commute by car.  I know this will sound absurd to a lot of people in HN, but if you told a Los Angelan your commute to work was 45 minutes each way, they would say ""that's pretty good.""<p>However, if you bought a home in Torrance and live there and a company in downtown LA wants to hire you, even though you're only driving about another 8 miles or so, your commute will probably explode close to an hour and a half, and at least one day a week there'll be some clsuterfuck of an accident on one of the freeways, and you'll have the lovely experience of leaving your house at 8:00am and somehow still being late to your 10:00am stand-up meeting.  Fun times!<p>So I saw home ownership cause former coworkers limit their economic mobility to within <i>one section of one city.</i>  For them, it was an option to simply wait until a desirable job opened up in the areas with a bad-but-not-intolerable commute, or they were able to mitigate commutes by negotiating flexible hours with their employers (e.g. working 7am to 3pm, or 11am to 8pm, or only coming in 2-3 days a week, etc).<p>I recognize Los Angeles' traffic is about as bad as it gets as far as a home ownership ""anchoring"" someone, but if home ownership causes a reduction in mobility for professionals in a high-earning and high-demand field, I can only imagine the kind of impact it has on the rest of America.",1370397853

I buy more stuff from them than anywhere else, actually.<p>I've even bought a couple of suits from them, and they were fine. It's not a problem as long as you measure carefully and plan on getting some alterations/hemming done locally (as you would with any off-the-rack suit).<p>Hey, that might be an idea. Amazon sends around someone to measure you, then you get a bespoke, tailor-made suit delivered in a week or so.

My initial thought was that they way to achieve this at a lower cost would be to redirect all mail direct to this company, who could then receive all customers' mail at one central office/warehouse which would lower staff costs massively.<p>I don't know if mail redirection is possible or easy to set-up in the US, but it is in the UK - although I just checked prices, and that alone would cost $6.40/month for each customer. [2]<p>> <i>These people most likely scan mail at their homes using a scanner provided by Outbox.</i><p>If their FAQ is truthful, they will bring all mail back with them - as it says you won't get mail delivered unless you specifically request an item. Maybe they have clever machines to speed through the process of opening/scanning/filing? At the very least, this means drivers can just rush round collecting items, and the opening/scanning process can then be streamlined back at HQ.<p>[1] <a href=""http://help.outboxmail.com/customer/portal/articles/984656-how-do-you-collect-my-mail-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.outboxmail.com/customer/portal/articles/984656-h...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZGsrC9zxlm0J:www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk&client=firefox-nightly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ZGsrC9z...</a>",1370397699

7165985,comment,7164602,7164602,12,0,StevePerkins,,,"By this article&#x27;s logic, virtually every Linux desktop environment &quot;stole&quot; from Microsoft for over 10 years, and have spent the past 10 years &quot;stealing&quot; from Apple instead.  Hacker News is stealing from a million different old Perl-based forum sites.  Sure, you kinda sorta have a point... but it would be very hypocritical for anyone here to care much about that point.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure that I buy the main premise of the article, that GitHub&#x27;s and BitBucket&#x27;s &quot;communities&quot; warrant comparison.  Of course they don&#x27;t.<p>GitHub&#x27;s pricing model offers you open collaboration for free, and charges you for private repos.  Thus it is ideal for open source development, and open community.<p>BitBucket&#x27;s pricing model offers you unlimited private repos for free, but charges you by the number of collaborators.  It also integrates well with JIRA, a very popular task/bug tracking system in small to midsize shops.  In sum, it&#x27;s not really trying to be an open source &quot;community&quot;... it&#x27;s trying to compete for the in-house business of small to midsize shops.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to draw collaborators to your open source project, then BitBucket is a poor host.  Likewise, if your company has one or two dozen developers and a large number of repos, then GitHub makes no sense as a paid host.<p>All of my personal projects are on GitHub, and my company is all on BitBucket.  I&#x27;m not so much interested in their &quot;innovation vs. creative bankruptcy&quot; as I am in the choices they&#x27;ve made with structuring their pricing models.",1391349594

Also a third party firmware brings no benefit in the eyes of the corporation, device was already sold(thanks to marketing and low price) and now comes device bricking firmware that inflates costs and eats margins. It&#x27;s very easy to see why someone would like to defend himself against such menace.

That&#x27;s the problem I&#x27;ve noticed:  Do you really want to hire someone who takes 80 hours to accomplish something that takes 8 hours for someone else?  I think we&#x27;ve all seen this happening.  I was brought in to a parallel team one day because they were about to miss a deadline.  Turns out 25 year old guy was trying to build a graph database from scratch.  He didn&#x27;t know that he was building a graph database, and wasn&#x27;t really aware they existed.  He just knew what he needed, and went about building it.  He spent a huge amount of time building his own awful, non-performant implementation.  I told the team lead to get Bob to help.  Bob has kids who are in their mid 30&#x27;s.  Bob sat down, logged into the VM, and a few hours later had an instance of Neo4J running and hooked into the app.<p>But hey, he thinks foosball tables don&#x27;t belong in offices, so why hire him at a startup?",1391349254

For comparison, the radiation worker yearly dose limit is 50mSv, but the 50mSv are distributed to all the body, and you get the 20mSv in your finger. Doesn’t sound good.<p>The problem is the repetition. Taking 4000 dental x-rays in a year is not a good idea. (I’m not sure if someone proved that it’s dangerous, but don’t try this just in case.) This is also the reason why x-rays technicians hide behind a shield while taking the x-ray.<p>* Nobody claims that x-rays are not dangerous. The claim is that the risk is minimal under reasonable use and in some circumstance (for example an accident) the benefits are much bigger than the risks.<p>* And the Linear No-Threshold model is mostly an upper bound, the risk of small radiation dose is perhaps smaller than what is extrapolated from big radiation doses.<p>For example, suppose that 4000000 patients take one dental x-ray and 1000 dentist take 4000 dental x-rays each one. In which group will be bigger the increase of the cancer total number? The Linear No-Threshold model says that the expected number should be equal. But perhaps it’s smaller in the patients group, because the body perhaps can deal better with a low number of problems from radiation.",1391348965

This is <i>normal</i> there, and most people are okay with it. Yeah, some publishers and developers take it a bit far, but a lot of others don&#x27;t. Combat Arms/Warrock sort of had a pay-to-win setup -- you bought weapons with in game cash, or could buy them outright. But, play a few games, get some cash and suddenly you have the same weapons those who have no patience did, and more importantly it was a twich based skill FPS -- even if you had the best weapon, I&#x27;d still headshot you with the base M4 before you knew what was happening.

For example I am 36 and even though I feel that I am up on Node.js and CoffeeScript and ToffeeScript and some NoSQL and Three.is and some other stuff that I think is still relatively new, I have little to no mobile dev experience.  Part of that might be related to the fact that mobile dev was sort of niche for a significant part of my programming career.  I have a lot of experience with many different technologies but not the same ones as younger developers so I don&#x27;t quite share their programming worldview.<p>I have also spoken to a number of developers older than me who are far behind.  Like they didn&#x27;t understand the point of Ruby or Node and thought Php was just fine.  Or they thought that all of the organizations code should go in two giant repos like the old svn way.<p>So the reality is that sometimes older people aren&#x27;t up to date or don&#x27;t share your culture.<p>Having said all of that I personally believe that in most respects younger developers are just as far behind as the older developers and often lacking quite a bit if perspective.

It is also possible to run a Python/django app in an Azure Website Service. The cost is the same, but  management and security if the OS is taken care of for you. Upgrades and patches happen automatically. You can setup automated build, test and deployment from Git. You can setup background and maintenance jobs without having to manage cron. You can setup auto scaling of VM&#x27;s. It saves a lot of work.<p>Of course, this risk of this is lock-in. But the technologies underlying Azure are almost all open. If you&#x27;re carefull what you use, you can always take your code and run it on a VM in AWS if you want. Of course, you would have to setup/build your own scaling and maintenance processes, using (also proprietary) AWS services.<p>Like Microsoft, Amazon is likewise trying to get you to use proprietary cloud services. If you use S3, Beanstalk, Redshift, Search, you get locked in to AWS the same way Microsoft will lock you when you use SQL Azure, Azure Table Storage or Service Bus. You just need to be be very careful with any dependencies you take on into your startup.<p>That said, I have also had a very good experience with BizSpark. Not only do they give you lot of free stuff, but I they can also connect you with interesting partners internationally, and help your business in unexpected ways.",1391346888

What you will find, though, is that there&#x27;s a tradeoff there, because not everyone does; as you get older, you&#x27;re less inclined to work 80 hours a week for a project (unless it&#x27;s your own.)<p>At the new company, we hire for cultural fit, and this means we tend towards (but aren&#x27;t exclusive) people around our own age (27, on average).

Quite an allegation.<p>But don&#x27;t forget to consider that rather than the American media, not a small bunch to corral easily, conspiring at the government&#x27;s request not to report on something &quot;juicy,&quot; that the media may have simply had things to cover that they felt were juicier or were perhaps spooked by the incendiary nature of the interview and engaged in self-censorship. And that it&#x27;s possible American media has a different take on what&#x27;s juicy and what&#x27;s become old news versus foreign media.<p>Also consider that with the Internet it&#x27;s not easy anymore to effectively create a media blackout over something not much worse than what&#x27;s already been revealed by the media without repercussions.

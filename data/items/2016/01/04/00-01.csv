People just got up and left their property.<p><i>...the decay of trade and industry was not a cause of Rome’s fall. There was a decline in agriculture and land was withdrawn from cultivation, in some cases on a very large scale, sometimes as a direct result of barbarian invasions. However, the chief cause of the agricultural decline was high taxation on the marginal land, driving it out of cultivation. Jones is surely right in saying that taxation was spurred by the huge military budget and was thus ‘indirectly’ the result of the barbarian invasion.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography_of_the_fall_of_...</a><p>History does not repeat, but it surely does rhyme.",1451869138

If performance is mission critical, a two-language code base (Python + C/C++/Fortran/CUDA) is not that hard to do, fairly common, and will give you the required performance.<p>> Bringing up Fortran&#x27;s speed here is like commenting on how much faster C++ is in a thread about Ruby.<p>No; once you start saying &quot;I want more performance than Python&quot;, it&#x27;s obviously interesting to see what level of performance a &quot;low-level&quot; language gets, to put the result in perspective.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not trying to beat down on D, so please try to interpret this as constructive criticism.

I have come from a Java/Swing Development, so developing with GWT was rather easy for me. Over the years as I&#x27;ve been training junior developers to develop with GWT, I found it is rather hard for them to get their heads around the framework. But, once they do - it becomes easier.<p>GWT is for large codebases, if you are trying to make a small project with GWT - you won&#x27;t find much benefit from it. As the development is Java based, there is a lot of cross-pollination of good ideas, practices and tools. For example, you could use familiar testing frameworks, DI frameworks and debugging tools.<p>Finally, you can share code between Server, Web Clients and (Native) Mobile Clients.

I am modeling it after Mega.co.nz, which provides varying levels of ways to be confident that the JavaScript it is serving you is not compromised, and relies on you having a private key it never intercepts.<p>I think the biggest barrier to privacy online right now is how inaccessible applications like Bitmessage are to the average user. Having to install a local python code base and store gigabytes of data that takes potentially hours to download sucks.<p>A browser application like this is not a fool-proof method of privacy, but it&#x27;s pretty darn good, and is leaps and bounds better than Facebook which stores your data in plain text and proceeds to sell it or whatever. It&#x27;s also better than something like a zero-knowledge service such as SpiderOak&#x27;s Kloak where your data is still owned (but encrypted) by some random person who can revoke your access at any time and track your usage, who you&#x27;re communicating with, and possibly serve you malicious JavaScript.<p>In summary, an application that:\n* Provides completely anonymous, encrypted, untraceable, uncensorable messaging between people and groups (using Bitmessage as the data store)\n* Is accessible like any other web application and provides pretty good security in doing so\n* Can be used as a browser extension if you want virtually guaranteed security/privacy\n* Relies on a data store that no one owns, everyone can access, and everyone can forever contribute to<p>There are questions about the security of Bitmessage, but I know it will be improved over time.<p>It is a struggle to decide how much time to dedicate to this application, though.

He describes how the valuations everyone talks about in the press often come from preferred stock financing rounds (ie: classes of stock which come with a caveat limiting both their upside and downside).  As a result, the numbers betray what many people think to be the company&#x27;s &quot;valuation&quot; come IPO time (Square, which possessed a &#x27;ratchet&#x27; was an example of this apparently).  As a result he said it&#x27;s possible to largely disregard many of the stated &quot;valuations&quot; in the press for these $1bn+ companies as their financing rounds have been closer to debt than equity.  One key upshot of this also was that people holding common stock (employees who have exercised options, e.g.) may be caught with their pants down as they made choices based on a stated valuation which differed from that of their shares.<p>[0]: The Jay & Farhad Show: The Tech Industry: Tech Bubble or Tech Bust?\n<a href=""https://overcast.fm/+DcD5EhUGs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://overcast.fm/+DcD5EhUGs</a>",1451865826

Can you help me understand?<p>I&#x27;m an experienced cook, so (again, with the exception of the immersion circulator) I&#x27;m not in the target market for these devices.  I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the target market though.  I was thinking that it was for inexperienced people who want to cook at home.  When I play that scenario through my head, it doesn&#x27;t completely work.<p>Take your salmon example: getting the pan to a good temperature and cooking the fish to the ideal temperature is not easy, so I can see how an inexperienced person could easily benefit from real-time temperature feedback.  What I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out though, is that after gaining experience from cooking fish a few times, what&#x27;s the benefit of the real-time temperature feedback?  I guess the thing I&#x27;m wrestling with is that as one becomes more experienced, the value of these smart devices seems to rapidly diminish.<p>I don&#x27;t intend this to be negative or harsh, so I hope it doesn&#x27;t come across that way.

9687617,comment,9686577,9686577,0,0,VLM,,,"The article could be extended and mashed up to obtain an interesting, perhaps useful, alternative conclusion.<p>A quarter century ago there were very popular pop psychology books by a guy named john gray whom I believe is still alive on the difference between men talking about problems and women talking about problems with the claim of an unusually accurate stereotype is men, especially tech men, mostly talk about problems to fix them as best they can (however poorly that may be) and women mostly talk about problems to air their grievances and de-stress and if they wanted a best effort repair, being strong women they&#x27;d have already done it themselves so men should F off, shut up, listen, and not tell them what to do.  The above is a gross and inaccurate summary based on failing memories of an entire series of pop psych books from a long time ago, but I don&#x27;t think I totally messed up my summary.  At least not on purpose.<p>Anyway looking at the article thru 25 year old pop psych glasses in a crazy extended mash up, the author is bent out of shape because worldwide whenever problems are discussed the only response is the &quot;manly response&quot; of trying their best to fix the problem, however incompetently.  So far the author and quarter century old pop psych are in sync.  They diverge at my suggestion that perhaps attempting the &quot;womanly response&quot; of actually listening would be worth a try when confronted with a problem.  Or maybe 25 year old pop psych is best left in the dustbin of history.  But it is interesting to think about a bit.<p>I&#x27;ve made a lot of money for longer than many HN readers/posters have been alive by fixing stuff.  When I&#x27;ve gotten really stuck, sometimes its helped to actually listen rather than wielding keyboards and screwdrivers and soldering irons.  Just saying anecdotally the obsolete pop psych stuff is occasionally not totally useless.<p>Note I&#x27;m not trying to ignite a flamewar about women in tech.  Especially since &quot;shut up and listen&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily only useful when talking to women, and I&#x27;m not even claiming that a quarter century old pop psych worldview is true or universal or even generally useful, although I am claiming its super creepy deja vu to hear a modern retelling of part of the story, admittedly with different conclusions.  Its just that the author describing (male) techies trying to solve the worlds problems totally sounds like something John Grey would have written.  I wonder if the author read the same books and quite possibly unconsciously is channeling John Grey or something.",1433873939

We may still need more quality lawyers, but as we remove the uses for inexperienced lawyers, we are decreasing the number of future experienced lawyers.<p>Translation used to be a very non-trivial work.

I&#x27;m a Python(2) user who is always on the lookout for the next language to jump to since I&#x27;m never moving to Python3. With Swift on the server and iOS, and being a very pleasing language similar to Python, this will be what I study next as I look to migrate off Python2 as it dies (which itself may take a while).

Are they in-house or a 3rd party firm?  Do they have a tech-specific background?  How long? What other searches are they working on? Then (assuming the recruiter is a seasoned professional, make a friend); offer you may be able to help them with referrals to your network.<p>Try this word track-- &#x27;I get calls like yours a lot. The role sounds interesting.  But my process to evaluate potential opportunities is to &#x27;always&#x27; do a brief phone-screen with the Hiring Manager first. I&#x27;m not a prima donna, but I&#x27;ve found this ultimately saves everyone&#x27;s time and energy. Feel free to share my profile and background notes with him. If you still want to move forward; I can be available for a call Friday morning @ 9:30am&quot;",1433873006

9687461,comment,9686824,9686824,0,0,soham,,,"(About me: I was an early engineer at one of the fastest growing SaaS company on the planet. I had the privilege of contributing to our interview process that took us from 5 to 250 engineers. I&#x27;m now trying it from the candidate side: <a href=""http://InterviewKickstart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://InterviewKickstart.com</a>)<p><i>tl;dr</i><p>You have three choices:<p>1. Apply with a strong referral and/or<p>2. Apply to exactly the same kind of jobs/projects that you have had work experience in, and/or<p>3. Apply to a company that&#x27;s hiring only one or two people a quarter (slow, careful)<p><i>A bit more</i><p>Everyone hates the tech interview process. Everyone. Including people on the other side.<p>Let&#x27;s understand the process, by taking the most typical case, where a candidate with experience in X type of projects, is applying for a job with Y type of projects.<p>e.g. If you have worked on say Payment Systems&#x27; projects for last 5 years and you are now applying for Deployment Systems&#x27; role, then as an interviewer, how do I evaluate you? I don&#x27;t know enough about Payment Systems to judge your work of 5 years in 45 minutes. And I can&#x27;t presume you know enough about Deployment Systems that I can ask you questions built on my knowledge of several years.<p>I hence have the following options:<p>1. I ask someone about you. That&#x27;s possible, but not systematic, because I need to find a person that I trust very well. It&#x27;s much better if that person refers you. Hence your option #1.<p>2. I can hope that you and I have some project in common in the same domain. That&#x27;s getting much harder these days, as programming is getting very vast. Hence your second option. Then I can evaluate your work and decide one way or another, quickly.<p>3. I can look at your work of a different domain and give it a proper evaluation. That&#x27;s takes time, often hours and days. I can&#x27;t spend that much time, when my goal is to hire 20 engineers a quarter (and hence interview 5x more). Not to mention that evaluation is also subjective, error-prone and contentious. Everyone has different ideas on design and code-quality. Add that to the fact that I need your work evaluated by everyone in the team, not just me. It just becomes untenable. Hence your third option (apply to a place that&#x27;s hiring slowly).<p>Being human, hence, I have to fall back to the path of least resistance. That path is to find the lowest common denominator of our knowledge, which can be evaluated in a short amount of time. Yes, it&#x27;s not perfect and it&#x27;s still a bit subjective, but there aren&#x27;t that many ways of writing quicksort <or insert your favorite question>, you know.<p>I hence ask you that question, begrudgingly, knowing fully well, that I&#x27;m myself going to be subjected to the same treatment when I go out interview. But at least now I know why, and I look for the best I can in the current process.<p>Humans.",1433872857

1068383,comment,1068382,1068382,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I think the biggest problem with VC's is that there is absolutely no quality control. When an entrepreneur decides to raise money, we will need to talk to at least 20 to 50 firms and most of the VC's that we speak to really have no clue as to what it takes to build a sustainable business. So after a while, if all we do is to chase after VC money, we become part of their echo chamber. My experience is that VC's are not miracle workers. I believe one study shows that 5% of the VC’s make 95% of the money. Therefore as entrepreneurs, we are competing with 95% of the dogs for 5% of the meat. I think bootstrapping is very important for both entrepreneurs and for the VC's. In my experience, the only way to have a meaningful conversation with VC's is when we are already shipping products. I usually don't even prepare a separate PowerPoint presentation. Instead I start the meeting by saying, ""Let me show you how I convince customer ABC to buy our product"". Life is good after that.<p>The following is a good read if you want to learn more about VC's from an entrepreneur's perspective.<p><a href=""http://www.startupforless.org/2007/10/how-to-turn-your-vc-into-your-worst-enemy-by-denny-k-miu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupforless.org/2007/10/how-to-turn-your-vc-in...</a>",1264109411

(Pittsburgh, Tampa, and Chicago Midway did it right.)<p>This looks like there's three trade-offs to putting restaurants in the secure zone:<p>- If a group is traveling together, and only a member or two is taking a flight, putting the restaurants behind security will prevent the group from dining together.<p>- Put restaurants behind security will lock out local customers who live/work near the airport, but not actually needing to fly.  In my experience, some restaurant chains will make better or more interesting locations at high traffic areas than more ""locally"" focused places.<p>- Finally, putting these places behind security will increase potential bottlenecks in the way system, since now more employees will need to be monitored or tracked.

If I have a can of soda and a cup of Ben and Jerry's, that's 37% of the day's calories right there, with pretty much no nutritional value.  So you can have junk food, but not so much that it's going to make it hard to get all the nutrients to need while staying under your whole quota.<p>Another guideline is that if you end every day hungry, you're doing it wrong.  Cheese will fill up your quota without filling you up.  Fruits and vegetables, on the other hand, are filling and nutritious without packing a lot of calories.  I shoot for a roughly even three-way split between calories from fat, protein, and carbs.  I don't really use ""special"" caloric restriction recipes; I just cook/prepare whatever I want, while staying within the rules.  I eat out a few times a week too.<p>Typical breakfast is eggs, maybe with mushrooms or something thrown in, and a fruit.  A lunch might be chicken or fish with salad, or maybe a sandwich (bread is calorically dense, though, so careful).  Dinner is pretty much the same as lunch, except that it's almost never a sandwich, is probably a bit more food, and includes red meat more frequently.  Lentils and beans are all-around excellent, by the way.<p>I do count calories, because it would be too easy to lose track or cheat otherwise.  I use Daily Burn, which has a huge number of foods in their database, and if I eat something they don't have, I guesstimate using things they do have.  Counting calories makes it a lot easier to stick with it, because the more aware you are of what you're eating, the less tempted you are to be naughty.",1264107995

787942,comment,787759,787759,0,0,silencio,,,"I think the author forgets that Apple initially told all us developers to forget the idea of a native iPhone app and just deal with having only webapps for the iPhone until iPhone OS 2.0 was released.<p>I think the author also forgets the 30% cut, while making Apple a small profit, is also about paying for hosting the app, running the app store, providing limited support to users, credit card fees, and other such overhead. If Apple really desperately wanted that 30% cut, Mobile Safari would not be supporting HTML 5 features like geolocation that make it easier for webapps to access the same information native apps can. I expect to see further improvements to Mobile Safari that make it even easier to take advantage of the iPhone's hardware.<p>Plus, there <i>is</i> a subscription model for the app store that is not news, but is not yet commonly found on the app store yet. One example would be some of the monthly fee-based GPS navigation apps. The same model also allows for adding more content to applications for an additional fee.<p>I don't disagree that the app store is broken in some ways and needs fixed (wait, I don't see most consumers actually caring about it though...), but the argument is presented without sufficient research on the part of the author, even taking into consideration the date on which it was posted.",1251316552

In fact I agree that finishing any project is usually tough, some aspect of it sucks. Why are so many things left unfinished? Doesn't matter what the project is pick one. Where I work there is unlimited demand for time and features and projects compared to finite time available to work on them. The most successful folks have learned the skill of figuring out what to say no too. In the face of unlimited demand, one might as well only choose the ""Hell yeah"" stuff. Life is better that way. It took me a long time to figure that out. If all of the stuff one said ""Hell yeah"" to was easy life would be boring. Running a 100 miles doesn't sound to easy to me. If one does survive the hard phase on a ""Hell yeah"" project that is what the best things life are made of. Might as well try out as many ""Hell yeah"" things as possible.

You will have an economic incentive to get more efficient appliances, cars, etc while this costs the federal government very little. To combat the regressiveness of this proposal, the feds could offset this with reducing payroll taxes.<p>The obvious downside of this is that it doesn't have the ""sexiness"" of the rebate (it's a behavioral finance thing) and we wouldn't see the returns immediately.",1251316199

From what I understand Muay Thai is a much better cardio workout. Tae-Kwon Do might be more fun but it wouldn't benefit me as much as the Muay Thai (not to mention kickboxing is probably more useful in a real fight).<p>So to reiterate my original statement: I think you can end up making the wrong decision if it's based purely upon excitement in an idea and not practical information which may be less exciting.

Also, most, if not all, of these golf courses have the worst looking websites, which leads me to believe that there is no one looking after any web presence or anything web-related.<p>This actually touches on a bigger issue which I'd love to discuss.

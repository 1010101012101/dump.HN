The simplistic view that code can be accreted through a &#x27;red/green/refactor&#x27; cycle of adding a test, coding til it passes, and so on, misses the meta-game that it makes the developer play: if you are going to stick within the rules, you have to decide which test to add that will force you to write the correct additional code so that it enables the refactoring you know your code actually needs. If you actually know what the code should look like, it&#x27;s pointless trying to get there by trying to make the right sequence of legal test-first moves - it turns coding into a kind of chess puzzle.<p>TDD zealots will say &quot;but you&#x27;re overthinking it! YAGNI!&quot; but that is to deny that sometimes, a smart developer really is capable of holding more than a small piece of the system in her head at a time and can actually see elegant, flexible solutions before the tests force her to.",1398261576

7633917,comment,7633175,7633441,20,0,mhw,,,"> the factory/provider/whatever pattern, comes in real handy when 2 years from now, a crucial ODE library that your air-defense system uses, absolutely has to be replaced by something else.<p>Hmm; that&#x27;s the point where your enterprise experience and mine diverge. Here are what I consider the key observations from the organisations I&#x27;ve seen:<p>The majority of uses of dependency injection seem to be an attempt by a developer to not commit to a technology choice, or to build and preserve some feeling of control over the selection of platforms and technologies. Often I think this is a result of technology platform choices being taken away from the developer, typically by some kind of architecture function. So we abstract away from databases, ORMs, XML binding libraries, network transports, messaging systems, basically anything that&#x27;s not part of the core application. See Java Enterprise Edition deployment descriptors for an industrialised example.<p>At the same time, in any sufficiently complex enterprise environment, the chances of any of the platform technology choices changing rapidly is <i>tiny</i> because of the basic risk avoidance culture. And even if you do decide to try migrating to a new technology platform (e.g. database, app server, messaging platform etc), none of the existing deployed applications will migrate because the cost of retesting the application on the new platform is too high relative to the business benefit you can demonstrate.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you say &quot;it&#x27;s just a 20 line configuration change&quot;: the result of your configuration change is to switch from one implementation containing thousands of lines of code to another implementation containing thousands of lines of <i>different</i> code. Your ops team simply won&#x27;t trust you to put that configuration change live without as much testing as when you put the original application into production. And if it&#x27;s several months since the last production change, good luck getting hold of the people who can carry out the testing - they&#x27;ll all be off doing other things.<p>So the developer is building abstractions to insulate from changes in technology that never happen, but at the same time the one kind of change that&#x27;s guaranteed to come along over the lifetime of a deployed application is a change in business requirements. And this is typically the exact type of change that all the abstraction and configuration frameworks don&#x27;t tackle, because it usually results in changes in the way that components interact with each other, not just substituting one interchangeable part for another.<p>So, who can gain from abstracting away from the technology platform? Well the main benefit comes when you want the same code to run in many different environments. So the main uses in descending order of likelihood:<p>* You might sell the same piece of software into multiple customers and want to support the variation in environments you&#x27;ll find. Hello, IBM, Oracle and SAP, as you point out.<p>* You might have different configurations of your software for different environments (development, test, staging, production and so on), but you need to be careful to make sure your test results from one configuration are actually valid for another.<p>* You might <i>actually</i> need to run the same code in production in more than one environment. There are cases where this happens (e.g. in a desktop app vs. a web app, or a mobile app), but often its just as easy to build an API around the code and invoke it over the network.<p>So, in my experience the effort of implementing all this configurable decoupling is very rarely rewarded by a significant reduction in downstream effort.",1398261158

There are some\ncolleges that use Ada in introductory courses. There are others with\nstrong ties to the defense/aerospace industry that happen to offer Ada\ncourses as electives.

Ada 2012 [1] is the most\nrecent version, though given that I&#x27;m really encouraging this for\nembedded use you&#x27;d be using a subset of that. AdaCore is the primary\ndevelopers of GNAT, which is current through Ada 2012.

The language\nreference does specify how calling to C/C++, Fortran and Cobol code\nshould function or be exposed within an Ada implementation.

I&#x27;ve seen what results when these are absent, I&#x27;ve quit jobs because these were absent and the culture prevented any improvements. I&#x27;m not working on safety critical systems anymore, but if I ever end up back in those projects I will insist on using the right tools/processes.<p>I don&#x27;t want to wake up one day, turn on the news and read about a crash or malfunction that was caused or should have been prevented by my systems. Poor processes and tools enable these failures, and we should have zero tolerance for them. We have certifications/licensing for engineers (mechanical, civil, aerospace, electrical, etc.). If they sign off on a system/design that fails catastrophically and the failure should have been detected (via models or industry standards or whatever), they are held liable. Software developers in the safety/critical systems space have too cavalier an attitude, we&#x27;re too well insulated from the aftermath of our defects. That attitude may never be changed, but a change in tools/processes to ones that contain, minimize or eliminate large classes of failures is certainly worth the effort.",1398261108

For applications above a certain level of complexity you are forced to choose one of those paths. There simply is no way to avoid it. Both are valid choices of course, each with their own pros and cons. But don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking frameworks are somehow evil. What I think you mean when you say that is &quot;other people&#x27;s frameworks are evil&quot; and your frameworks (that you build with libraries) are awesome. That may be true, but keep in mind, when you build your own framework, you now have become the maintainer and de-facto teacher for both your application <i>and</i> your home-rolled framework you created to build it.

Much of the complexity that you get in client work where you don&#x27;t control the requirements Basecamp is able to simply avoid by not building.<p>The idea that if you own your own product and control the requirements that you can have a MUCH cleaner codebase without needing as many tests is 100% true. But, David didn&#x27;t say that and it&#x27;s a shame. It&#x27;s a much more powerful point because there are cases where clean architectures are valuable and the  standard Rails MVC pattern isn&#x27;t enough. At the same time, there are plenty of times where the basics will get you a very long ways. If you control the complexity, simple MVC might be all you ever need.<p>Everything in software development involves managing requirements and tradeoffs.

You reduce complexity, you reduce surface area required to test.<p>It&#x27;s like weight reduction in cars, you reduce overall weight a few pounds, you can also reduce an extra 5-10 lbs. in required components to support the added weight/complexity.<p>I just wish that people could discuss these ideas with nuance and empathy towards other project&#x27;s requirements.

These patterns add complexity from the get-go of an app. He ridicularizes, and picks both an extreme example and an extreme Angular solution, but the message is sound.<p>2. These patterns have failed us in the past. Anyone who has worked on large enterprise projects has dealt with the immense complexity and, surprisingly, with the lack of configurability in the end result (a failure of the pattern objective).<p>I&#x27;d add a last point, not explicitely stated:<p>3. Last, but definitely not least, Javascript does not need these! Javascript is not a classic object oriented language.<p>Let me try my hand at supporting my last point.

Just refer to a mythical DBConnection object in the DB client code:<p><pre><code>  connection = DBConnection.singleton()\n</code></pre>\nAnd have it so that the DBConnection object instance exists prior to being called (instantiate it in the configuration stage of the app):<p><pre><code>  DBConnection = { prototype: new PgsqlConnection(...) }\n</code></pre>\nJavascript being classless[1] and supporting prototype based object inheritance invalidates many of the assumptions behind patterns in use in classical OO languages.

As I think easy string interpolation is an antipattern, and I&#x27;m comfortable having to feed values into the string formatter, I&#x27;m not upset, but you&#x27;re not going to convince people with that.<p>As we slowly, oh so slowly, but surely move into languages where buffer overflows are not possible to write (or at least require scary excursions into some sort of &quot;unsafe&quot; package), easy string interpolations that allow the programmer to believe they don&#x27;t have to think about the correct encoding of the value become the next most pressing security threat. Pretty much every &quot;injection&quot; is due to over-simplified string interpolation.<p>Unfortunately, if your string interpolation syntax is as easy is &quot;This is an interpolated $string&quot;... it&#x27;s also <i>wrong</i>. Dead wrong, very wrong, run away screaming wrong wrong <i>wrong!</i> String interpolation is actually a very hard problem, and this <i>must</i> irreducibly manifest itself in the API. ImJasonH&#x27;s example, while it isn&#x27;t &quot;string interpolation&quot; in the Ruby/Perl/etc. sense, <i>does</i> involve using a template system with sensible escaping mechanisms... it&#x27;s HTML-specific, though, but for HTML it&#x27;s incredibly powerful and easy to use <i>correctly</i>. In fact Go&#x27;s HTML templating is the most powerful and easy-to-use <i>correct</i> HTML templating system I&#x27;ve ever seen that isn&#x27;t in Haskell. Presumably there are others out there, but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of the competition and most of them will sit by, twiddling their thumbs and whistling idly, while you put 100 injections of every kind into your HTML page.<p>My guess is Go will never grow this style of string interpolation, pretty much because it is so very, very frequently wrong. The way Go is already doing it is as easy as it can feasibly be, without encouraging wrongness.",1398259406

Part of what makes a good business person a good business person is an ability to navigate the potentially frustrating waters of professional communication. Consider the exchange the author laid out. He repeats the same thing over and over again (give me details please), assuming the other person will pick up on the passive aggressive repetition and begin to do things on his terms. Instead of accommodating this person&#x27;s communication style, he blows them off. Notice this: he blows off the opportunity not on its substance, but on his impression of its messenger. If the guy wants a phone call, roll your eyes privately, give him a phone call, and blow him off ten minutes in if the opportunity doesn&#x27;t seem worthwhile.<p>Secondly, there&#x27;s this idea that time spent programming is the most productive, and anything that subtracts from your precious programming time is a waste of time. This is a tricky point, and I&#x27;m going to head off all the impassioned comments stating that programming actually is sacred by saying: sometimes the biggest gains can be made through design and development, but sometimes not. Witness all imperfect products that represent successful businesses because their leadership knew when to devote attention to development and when to pull off and devote attention to business.<p>If he were a programmer being paid for his programming time, it would be absolutely the case that any time spent not programming was a waste. However, the post clearly states that he&#x27;s in charge of the product, and yet he seems to have budgeted little time and apparently no attention to furthering the product. If doing product work is such a waste of his time, it would be in his best interest to bring on someone who will do that full time for him, allowing him to focus on programming full time.",1398259389

Not joking I&#x27;ve done this job for 15 years and worked with several large companies including one you mention. Perhaps your experience is in the 1% of &quot;enterprise&quot; companies who have clue but this by far is the majority:<p>Bold statement here: 99% of the use cases of all these patterns are totally pointless and a waste of money and time. The add nothing to the product, they increase complexity, decrease performance. It&#x27;s cheaper and more reliable to chop your product up and write each chunk in whatever separately with no official architectural pattern usage system-wide.<p>Typically in the real world, you&#x27;re going to end up with:<p>1. Literally tonnes of DI/IoC code and configuration for an application with an entirely static configuration. This is either in XML or DSL form using builder patterns. Consumes 30 seconds or more to start the application up every time. Aggregate over 50 developers is 16 hours a day pissed out of the window.<p>2. Proxies for anaemic domain models that are fully exposed. Consumes 30 seconds to generate proxies that do sod all. Aggregate over 50 developers is 16 hours a day pissed out of the window.<p>3. Leaky broken abstractions everywhere actually destroying the entire point of the abstractions. Makes refactoring impossible and maintenance hell. It&#x27;s better in some cases that they are not even there and that basic savvy is used over COTS patterns.<p>4. Acres of copy pasta. Why bother to write a generic implementation when you can copy the interface 50 times and change the types by hand?<p>5. Patternitis. So we need to use the BUILDER pattern to write the query to connect to the DOMAIN REPOSITORY for the AGGREGATE to call the CODE GENERATOR that fires up the ADAPTER to generate the SQL using the VISITOR PATTERN which farts out some SQL to the database PROVIDER (and a 90 layer stack dump when it shits itself). This is inevitably used in one small corner while everyone in the rest of the system hits a wall in the abstraction and says &quot;fuck it&quot; and writes SQL straight up and skips the layers of pain and because there are no code reviews (because people are all sitting there waiting for their containers to start up whilst posting cats on Facebook).<p>LINE 10 (remember this)<p>These things are never rewritten or refactored. They slowly evolve into a behemoth ball of mud which collapses under its own weight to the detriment of customers, a team of enterprise architects (usually from ThoughtWorks etc) usually appear at this point then attempt to sell outsourcing services who will &quot;fix all the shit&quot; for a tiny fee, leave a 200 page powerpoint (with black pages just to fuck your printer up). The company struggles on for a few years and is saved at the last minute by a buy out by a company at an early stage of the cycle who slowly port all the customers and buggy shit to their product platform. Then the team either dissolve and knowledge is lost or they take a cash sum from the sale and start up some ball of shit company that does the same again.<p>GOTO 10.<p>That&#x27;s enterprise 101 because the people that have been hit by the clue sticks know better than to subject themselves to this and do work in SF and SV and London. Me: I&#x27;m a masochistic crazy person who wonders every day why I don&#x27;t just go and write web sites for half the cash or flip burgers because it&#x27;s less painful.",1398259305

This was the first time most of the students did any programming at all. To fix, this they changed the course to the class room being &quot;theory&quot;. Which mostly meant learning terms (What is an Int, String, etc). The second half of the class was a &quot;lab with paired programming&quot;. Those who knew how to program going in would carry those who didn&#x27;t. Many students couldn&#x27;t even type at a reasonable speed. If you and your pair had no idea how to complete the assignment, the TA would basically do it for you.  This brought the fail rate in line with other classes. This continued for the rest of their college career.  You could get through doing <i>zero</i> solo programming.<p>The result was seniors who don&#x27;t know about inheritance.  The only thing they know is &quot;public void someName()&quot;.

In python you can always monkey patch whatever outside dependencies you have, whereas in Go, you can&#x27;t do that without structuring your code to allow it.  Careful use of interfaces and dependency injection can let you do it, but if you don&#x27;t know to use that style, you can get big blocks of code that become hard to test because they expect the whole operating environment to exist, which may be hard to do during testing.<p>If you want to write code in a Domain Specific Language (even if that domain is &quot;math&quot;), it&#x27;s nearly impossible in Go.  You can&#x27;t do operator overloading or all the really crazy hacking on the functionality of basic parts of the language to make it work in fundamentally different ways (the way you can with numpy etc).  Go will always look like types, functions, and methods.<p>Right now, Go has no user-defined generics.. this is actually not a problem for many projects, but if you happen to need a lot of specialized containers for different types (like red black trees, graphs, etc), then it can be a barrier.  There are ways around it, probably the best way is just code generation to duplicate the container code per type that you need. The other option is just using interface{}, which is basically void* or &quot;Object&quot; for Go, and casting in and out of it... but that can be slow.<p>There&#x27;s probably some stuff I&#x27;m missing, but those are the major points that I can think of.",1398258340

If you have (as I often do) a couple of hundred LOC spread across a few files, with one or two models/views, then there is negligible gain to automated testing - by the time you&#x27;ve set up/torn down the test DB, you could have refreshed the page in a browser 5 times and seen all the error messages in there. I accept that this threshold can be hit very rapidly once you get towards a modest website, even; but my day job basically involves writing toy SPAs with a very simple API behind the scenes, built and then left chugging along until they&#x27;re out of date, so I often sail under it.<p>A bigger anxiety I have about TDD is that, while there are no end of resources on using tests to drive software design, I haven&#x27;t come across much about good design of tests (suggestions very much welcome).

A lot of the examples are needlessly verbose and some are even wrong, like the &quot;providerprovider&quot; he rightly mocks.<p>Well, how about we look into the actual documentation?<p><a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers</a><p>What you find is that you define a provider like so:<p><pre><code>    myApp.provider(&#x27;Car&#x27; //...\n</code></pre>\nand then, if you want to configure it, you inject it with the suffix &#x27;Provider&#x27; into your config function (called when launching the app):<p><pre><code>    myApp.config([&quot;CarProvider&quot;, function(CarProvider) { //...\n</code></pre>\nSo - what&#x27;s so ridiculous about that?<p>----<p>Next up he still does not seem to understand the difference between Services, Factories and Providers. That&#x27;s cool and all and might even prompt some to, you know, investigate further and assume that maybe they haven&#x27;t understood it correctly yet before clicking &quot;must blog now&quot; button. He jumps the shark (straight to ridicule) by making up his very own nonsense:<p>> <i>Of course we we can configure providers if we need to configure our applications. How else could we configure our applications and make them configurable for our enterprise scale configurable applications.</i><p>You know, actually the distinction makes perfect sense. A provider is an object that you know you will want to configure globally before it is being used (data source providers, url routers etc.). A service sits on the other end of the spectrum and is being called freshly right when you need it (more in the direction of the pure objects he has in mind). Factories sit in between those two - they cannot be configured ahead of the application, but allow for more internal functionality instead of just returning an object.<p>Having the distinction helps people editing the code figure out what they want to do and others, in turn, to understand what the other programmer was up to. Yes, you can use them somewhat interchangeably, but that&#x27;s life for you: things overlap. How well and strict they are used <i>is up to the programmer</i>.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not bashing plain, custom OOP Javascript - If that&#x27;s your thing, by all means do it, knock yourself out! But what&#x27;s with the hating on people who seem to have a different approach? Wouldn&#x27;t it be healthier to first try to understand where <i>they</i> are coming from? Surely they can&#x27;t all be totally in love with wasting their time on &quot;ruining it&quot;.<p>----<p>In the end what this comes down to is that the author doesn&#x27;t seem to have sufficient experience with the kinds of environments that make the structures in AngularJS not just pleasant, but actually a life saver. That&#x27;s fine - we don&#x27;t need to all have the same perspective. I just don&#x27;t get this style of argumentation that boils down to &quot;don&#x27;t understand, must bash&quot;.<p>He also makes fun (as does one of the SO comments) of this quote from the (old?) angular docs:<p>> <i>An Angular &quot;service&quot; is a singleton object created by a &quot;service factory&quot;. These service factories are functions which, in turn, are created by a &quot;service provider&quot;. &quot;The service providers are constructor functions&quot;. When instantiated they must contain a property called $get, which holds the service factory function.</i><p>You know what? Fuck it. When I tried to understand the Servicy/Factory/Provider distinction, I stumbled upon the same SO post and you know what ended up being the perfect way of understanding it? Forcing myself to go back to that paragraph right there <i>until I understood it</i>.<p>> <i>No, you are not reading a thesis, you are reading the angular docs apparently. If it were a thesis it would probably be trying to explain a solution to some sort of problem instead of describing a made up solution to a made up problem. (Actually, that&#x27;s not strictly true because academics are in a world of their own too but close enough).</i><p>> <i>It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t really do enterprise any more.</i><p>I&#x27;m as sceptical as the next guy about frameworks, hate &quot;enterprise&quot; with a fiery passion and I escaped academia before it fried my brain.<p>But I don&#x27;t think myself too cool to do my due dilligence before dismissing something that I very obviously don&#x27;t understand yet.",1398258125

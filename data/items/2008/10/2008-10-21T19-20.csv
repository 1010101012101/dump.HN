339276,comment,338956,339158,0,0,lsc,,,"yeah.  I guess I would extend this to all advertising that goes beyond making me aware a product is available.  If I know about it, and I need it and can afford it, I'll buy it.   If you have to browbeat or manipulate me into buying it, you've created negative value.  first it wasn't a good deal for me (or else I would have bought it without the browbeating)   and add to that the cost of browbeating or manipulating me.<p>But then, most people seem to prefer to buy from salesmen, even when buying technical products that the salesmen often don't fully understand.  After getting the facts about various products, most companies I've worked for then invite salespeople to pitch (salespeople who are often not technically qualified to even discuss the product)  and then make decisions based on how good the salespeople were.   This seems irrational to me, but it also seems to be how most businesses work, so maybe I'm wrong.",1224618095

Clearly they are part of it but money is the main driver.<p>Money is priority #1, that's why sports are so important.<p>Money is important to students as well, the bulk of the income their degree will generate depends on the reputation of the school, <i>not</i> on how much they actually know.<p>And that's when they are first entering the job market. 
After that first job, the only way college matters is through the relationships you built there. 
Obviously relationships you build at work matter more and more over time.<p>And here again sports is important in creating that image of tribal success that draws the people that you want to connect with, to make it far in life after college.<p>That's the way life and college work.<p>If you don't like this harsh and cynical money based game, go to a school that doesn't have a sports program and be a scholar.

339266,comment,338909,338909,0,0,seacheala,,,"It seems a little pre-apocalyptic to suggest that blogs ""as we know them"" will soon vanish from the earth. Sure, FB, Twitter, etc. are gaining ground - but more by creating a need that people didn't know to exist previously rather than by pushing out blogs. The problem with a text-full blog is its lack of interactive elements, which FB, Twitter have capture nicely. Collaborative technology may be where it's at, but unique, well-reasoned blogs that contribute to the intellectual landscape can stay around with a strong following (think fivethirtyeight)...it just seems that nobody's particularly interested in reading a tome about your personal daily errands anymore when status updates will suffice.",1224617336

339258,comment,338857,338857,0,0,daveambrose,,,"Fantastic read. Thanks for sharing. My favorite paragraphs:<p>""That is the ultimate irony behind ""The War of the Worlds."" The discovery that the media are not all-powerful, that they cannot dominate our political consciousness or even our consumer behavior as much as we suppose, was an important one. It may seem like a counterintuitive discovery (especially considering its provenance), but ask yourself this: If we really know how to control people through the media, then why isn't every advertising campaign a success? Why do advertisements sometimes backfire? If persuasive technique can be scientifically devised, then why do political campaigns pursue different strategies? Why does the candidate with the most media access sometimes lose?<p>The answer is that humans are not automatons. We might scare easily, we might, at different times and in different places, be susceptible to persuasion, but our behavior remains structured by a complex and dynamic series of interacting factors.""",1224616692

HN is packed with ppl who have taken the plunge into the unknown to start something without having any idea how it would turn out.

339253,comment,337828,339230,0,0,senihele,,,"Yeah, very good point about transparency.  I remember reading some entrepreneur's story who stressed fostering this kind of environment.  It is a somewhat different but related point: he insisted that everyone in the company spend time doing customer service, so everyone had a sense of what the customer's needs were and how the product was progressing.  I thought this was very clever.<p>I also think you're right - there doesn't seem to be enough innovation in regard to compensation.  Even bonuses don't necessarily create the right incentives - often these seem more related to the overall health of the economy rather than work or contributions.  While it is a good idea to share success with employees, regardless of the cause, it does little to encourage employees in their individual actions.  While you say this sort of salary structure is in reaction to a company's growth, it seems like they are even less useful as a company grows and each individual's contribution has an ever smaller affect on how well a company ultimately does.",1224616461

Each athletic program has a certain number of scholarships they give out. In the case of football, these scholarships are awarded almost entirely without regard to the academic quality of the athlete. How true that last statement is varies greatly from school to school, but in general, they only need to meet some pretty minimum requirements.

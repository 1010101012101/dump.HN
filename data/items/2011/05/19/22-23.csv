2565680,comment,2564078,2564078,14,0,randomwalker,,,"Today I got to talk to Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, one of the very few legislators who is fighting this. Here are my notes: <a href=""http://33bits.org/2011/05/19/fighting-protect-ip-congresswoman-lofgren/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://33bits.org/2011/05/19/fighting-protect-ip-congresswom...</a> There were some surprises for me. Here is the summary:<p><i>Appeals to free speech and chilling effects are at best temporary measures in the fight against Protect IP and domain seizures. Even if we win this time it will keep coming back in modified form; the only way defeat it for good is to convince Washington that artists are in fact thriving, that piracy is not the real problem, and that takedown efforts are not in the interest of society. We in the tech world know this, but we are doing a poor job of making ourselves heard in Washington, and this needs to change.</i>",1305845979

2565677,comment,2565458,2565458,8,0,tspiteri,,,"I'm not sure GNOME is becoming a Linux-only project, but if it were, I wouldn't see anything wrong with that. I think it is somehow similar to the window manager issue from a few years ago, where some people wanted GNOME to support lots of different window managers, which meant they had to work around the quirks in each of them, or limit the functionality to the lowest common denominator.<p>Sometimes, an issue in the desktop environment needs some deep digging for proper fixing. Having to dig deep into each of the supported platforms is daunting and will probably lead to a worse user experience. So I think they should just pick their platform and work on it.<p>Nobody expects Apple, for example, to support the Mac OS X UI on different kernels/platforms, even though Darwin is very Unix-like. Apple actually go one further and only support their own hardware. Why can't GNOME focus like Apple does?",1305845929

It's well known for some time that Redhat was providing the majority of funding for Gnome either in dollars or people hours. If Redhat could exert their influence over the rather influential Gnome project (Gnome is not known for strong internal leadership nor strong political/business acumen), it could potentially pull of something it has been trying to do for years: hurt Ubuntu.<p>That being said, it seems Ubuntu has been making the moves necessary to be less dependent on Gnome/GTK. I hate to sound all corporate espionagy but this really feels less about Gnome and more about the corporate players.<p>And leaving the tinfoil hat realm, if this is all about Gnome and what they want...I feel this is going to be a rough road and they don't have an idea what it really means to build an OS and being responsible for everything: upstream development, apps, drivers, hardware....the list goes on.",1305845388

2565625,comment,2564002,2565432,1,0,tzs,,,"Speaking of pharmaceutical patents, I'd like to see two changes:<p>1. There should be automatic licensing of the patent to anyone who wishes to make the drug, at a royalty rate on gross sales determined by statute. I'm thinking something around 5%.<p>2. The patent term should be extended from 20 years to something like 100 years.<p>The idea here is that drug companies invest huge amounts in developing new drugs. Many of these don't even pan out. Some make it into production, and they are patented for 20 years. The drug company then has to charge a lot to make up for that huge investment before the patent expires, and the generics come on market.<p>So, for the first 20 years we consumers pay something like $30-50/month (after insurance--it could be $200 or more a month without insurance) for these drugs until they go generic, then it drops to around $4/month (and that is without insurance!).<p>Under my proposal, the generics would come out right away, for maybe around $5/month, and the original company would make back its investment over a very long term instead of needing to make it back over a relatively short term.",1305844706

Cir. 1994)\n    (Newman, J., concurring). Given the reality that software source\n    code is human readable, and object code can be reverse\n    engineered, it is difficult for software developers to resort to\n    secrecy. Thus, without patent protection, the incentives to\n    innovate in the field of software are significantly reduced.\n    Patent protection has promoted the free sharing of source code\n    on a patentees termswhich has fueled the explosive growth\n    of open source software development.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    The economic benefits that flow from software innovation are the\n    product of significant investment in research and development.\n    And the incentives provided by the patent system encourage that\n    investment by providing the same quid pro quo as in other\n    technology fields: the promise of economic rewards in exchange\n    for the public disclosure of useful inventions. See generally\n    Testimony of Nicholas M. Donofrio, Executive Vice President,\n    Innovation and Technology, IBM Corp., Before the H.R. Comm. on\n    Science (July 21, 2005); Cong. Office of Tech. Assessment,\n    Finding a Balance: Computer Software, Intellectual Property, and\n    the Challenge of Technological Change, 23 (1992) (recognizing\n    that patent protection is of importance to the U.S. software\n    industry). The exclusive rights granted to patentees\n    encourage software innovators to pursue inventions that they\n    might not otherwise pursue, in broad and diverse areas.\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    Patent protection for software protects innovators from\n    appropriation of their efforts by free-riders. Without\n    patent protection, the risk of appropriation may force software\n    innovators into other, more promising ventures. See, e.g.,\n    Richard S. Gruner, Better Living Through Software: Promoting\n    Information Processing Advances Through Patent Incentives, 74\n    St. Johns L. Rev. 977, 1004 (2000). The free-rider problem is\n    particularly acute in the software sector because software\n    products are vulnerable to rapid, inexpensive copying that\n    undercuts the initial developers opportunity to benefit * *\n    *, thereby undermining its incentives to invest in software\n    development. Pamela Samuelson, et al., A Manifesto Concerning\n    the Legal Protections of Computer Programs, 94 Colum. L. Rev.\n    2308, 2332 (1994). While literal copying is the province of\n    copyright law, the ease of appropriating software source code\n    makes the patented inventions included in the code uniquely\n    susceptible to instant appropriation.\n</code></pre>\nThese are all taken from the amicus brief IBM filed in the Bilski case.\n<a href=""http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964-ibm.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patentlyo.com/08-964-ibm.pdf</a><p>edit: fixed to replace duplicate quote with the quote I meant to paste in.",1305844173

The app comes pre-packaged with a set of sites/blogs that people can subscribe to so they don't open the app to just a blank screen. We submitted to Apple last week and were rejected today because we need to have written permission from all of the pre-packaged blogs in order to use their names and images in the app.<p>Of course, trying to get permission from such sites would be a long, horrible process, so we are looking to replace these sites with ones we can get permission from quickly.<p>Here is a screenshot of what the app looks like on initial launch:<p>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/960396/Screenshots/blogfire.png<p>The user can re-arrange/edit the list to their liking by adding/removing sites.<p>If you own/write a blog and would like to be featured as part of the pre-packaged sites in the app, and you are willing to give written permission to that effect, please email me at chad@jazzychad.net with ""BlogFire"" in the subject line. Also include a link to an image/icon/avatar I can use for the site in the app.<p>This would be a great opportunity to get your blog featured in a shiny new app and potentially increase your readership. The app is free and has some viral sharing components, so we hope it will spread like, well, wildfire.<p>Also, if you are connected with any of the blogs in the screenshot and would be able to help get permission from them, please email me as well.<p>Thanks! -Chad, chad@jazzychad.net<p>EDIT: In your email, PLEASE also include a link to an image I can use for your site... preferably square at least 48x48",1305842952

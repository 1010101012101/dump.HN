But I don&#x27;t think a reasonable interviewer would <i>require</i> someone to get that answer, and I can see how this problem could showcase a candidate&#x27;s thought process and ability to reach incremental solutions.<p>For example, a naive approach is to sort and find the element where <i>arr[n] == arr[n+1]</i>.  From here, the interviewer can see if the candidate is aware that most sorts are O(nlogn).  A better candidate knows that with a fixed range, you can sort in O(n).  Maybe the candidate will go with a hash table or set and check for the duplicate that way.  I&#x27;ve interviewed people who look good on paper but don&#x27;t intuitively grasp how to use hash tables, so this is a useful screening exercise.<p>My point is not that this question isn&#x27;t simple, it&#x27;s just that there are a number of ways to approach it besides the &quot;aha&quot; moment that give you insight into how a candidate works.",1381949639

Who cares they look like goofballs wearing 50s clothes this is 1980 lets watch battlestar galactica (the original).<p>The dukes of hazard was all about the car chases, I didn&#x27;t even notice Daisy&#x27;s attire (or lack thereof) until my hormones kicked in and suddenly she was very interesting indeed, like from zero interest to 1000+ in what seemed like weeks.  When I was young I thought it was a stupid show, like a lame version of Knight Rider which I much preferred.<p>So the happy couple is reunited and their relationship rekindled on the love boat.  Well good for them but I have no interest in watching them smooch and grope each other for thirty seconds on camera.

Most appropriations laws do not specify that the executive can spend &quot;up to $X&quot; on a given thing, but must spend <i>exactly</i> $X on that thing. To wit:<p>> Regarding the spending power, the picture is a bit more nuanced. In<p>> the early years of the Republic, Congress passed laws that authorized the<p>> president to spend up to certain sums of money, and the president was<p>> accordingly able to carry out his constitutional duties while spending<p>> money in amounts not precisely specified by Congress.<p>> In most areas of the federal budget, however, that practice has long<p>> since ended. Congress now typically specifies precise amounts of money<p>> (or, in the case of so-called entitlement programs, precise formulae to<p>> determine amounts of money) that the president must spend for each<p>> authorized program.<p>> When Congress appropriates the money necessary to fund those authorized programs, it effectively orders the<p>> president to spend no more and no less than those amounts. It would be<p>> odd, indeed, if a president were to assert that he could choose to, say,<p>> send Medicare beneficiaries (or their medical care providers) less money<p>> than they would be entitled to receive under the relevant statute.

Or generating Java code - so one could write code in something more concise, without having whole team to do the same or even adding other language runtime JRE.<p>There could even be common abstractions for many target programming language, allowing to write algorithm once and then just translate it (browser + server data validation anyone? there are attempts to use translations to JavaScript from various languages, but why try emulating existing languages complex behaviour in JS instead of creating language specifically designed for translation?).<p>Related term is probably Concept Programming [1], with interesting presentation slides [2] in external links.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_programming</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xlr.sourceforge.net/Concept%20Programming%20Presentat...</a>",1381948628

Why not agents?<p>Because actor is an establish paradigm and that has been around for a while. I haven&#x27;t heard Hickey&#x27;s talk on &quot;agents&quot; but based on your description, how are agents radically different?<p>What stops actors from reading the snapshots of the world? They can 1) subscribe to &quot;world&quot; actor and get publication  when it changes or 2) if database is immutable (I guess you are hinting at Datomic or Clojure&#x27;s datastructures here?) an actor can also call a function. Remember actors in practice are there to help isolate concurrency contexts. Reading truly immutable data is safe so actors could just periodically read this immutable data (just think of the database a function). It would be awkward having to process messages from mailbox, timing out, then reading world state, process world state, going back to processing messages. Etc. I like 1) better.<p>>  the actor has to define its behavior.<p>How does an agent bypass defining its behavior? Doesn&#x27;t an agent have a piece of code that specifies what that agent does.<p>> and send transformation functions on the data of that specific agent, which will be then processed by the agent&#x27;s thread in an ordered way.<p>So this basically centralizes the state of all the agents in one central location that is an immutable database? Hmm interesting. It is a different way of looking it at it I guess. Each actor usually handles its own internal state privately. I guess we also assume that there is something underneath that constantly distributes all these incrementing tree of states across a whole system. I don&#x27;t know I would rather think of actors explicitly choosing to send their state to a system half way across the world rather than rely on another layer of distributing state.

It&#x27;s just that some tools are more dangerous than others. In other words, I don&#x27;t believe that threads are a &quot;worse is better&quot; approach. There are things that can be improved about the specific implementations of threading, but on the whole, the paradigm is far from broken.<p>> Empirically, if people are fucking up, it makes sense to analyze why and to give them automatic solutions to their fuck-ups.<p>The problem is that other implementations of concurrency are not as widely adopted and people tend to fall back on threads (especially OS threads) when they really don&#x27;t need them.

I feel like this is a great opportunity for the AskHistorians subreddit. But I think generalizing to just Europe says something, though, rather than comparing countries to countries. And while I do agree there has likely been some exaggeration, I also think you may be underestimating the logistics of massive populations considering the time period (as well as just how early they had certain things, if you&#x27;re ever near the Met in NY, check out their Chinese stuff and the dates next to them, though their collection is pretty small).<p>The best hypotheses I&#x27;ve seen (which I can&#x27;t find, it was in passing long ago somewhere), suggests European division fueled a lot of later innovation. War does seem to drive technology. When you&#x27;re China back then, who are you really competing against? You&#x27;ve already finished the conquering and unification phase that individual European countries are still dreaming about. So why do you need guns? You&#x27;re essentially Rome of East Asia (and Romans are no more, perhaps not a coincidence). Korea, Japan, and Vietnam are either vassals or non-threats. You&#x27;ve got silk, porcelain (which itself was pretty amazing compared to &quot;European&quot; alternatives), and tea to pass your time instead (and to trade with). You&#x27;re already pretty huge for the time period, and managing a country of that size and technology level is already pretty challenging. Meanwhile, Europe is a perfect climate for border skirmishing and competition. When England came knocking on China&#x27;s door in a more aggressive fashion, the Emperor at the time still had arrogant delusions about China&#x27;s comparative might. And they paid for that. But the opium wars and WW2 were a wake up call.<p>Also, glass. China never discovered glass, and glass unlocked all sorts of technologies.<p>Edit: So the other way of looking at it is: The Han tribe did get ahead of their neighbors with all their fancy doodads early on, and perhaps that&#x27;s why China is the size it is now. The Romans almost did it in their local sphere, and arguably England later, although by then technological spread was more uniform. If ancient Europe had been sitting next to ancient China, perhaps they&#x27;d be speaking Chinese now?",1381948293

That the system threading system would improve independently of the language and have fewer edge cases were put forth as good reasons to do that.<p>Initially it was slower because context switches are slower, and anything that had to context switch into and out of the kernel was thus slower. Later there were other reasons. &quot;User level&quot; or as I prefer &quot;Single Context&quot; [1] threads have the ability to be very fast because they have extra knowledge about what is going on and access to other address spaces (so you don&#x27;t have to save something if you know how it&#x27;s used). There has been lots of great work on this since the early 90&#x27;s when this decision was made so I suspect the issue would be significantly less.<p>[1] At the time kernel threads were &#x27;single context&#x27; and quite fast.

When I started working with Scala, I realized that its actor model was sort of like Erlang, but missing stuff like the supervisor tree which is rather useful. So I looked around, and discovered Akka. Shortly afterwards, Typesafe was formed by merging the groups creating Scala and creating Akka. Then, my company was moving towards a services oriented architecture that used the HTTP api as its core for accessing services. I felt that this was inefficient, especially because you couldn`t do any message queuing or event related stuff without layering it over the top of HTPP`s RPC calls. That seemed counterintutive because fire and forget messaging is a more fundamental construct than RPC. Then I discovered Spray which had already done a lot of the groundwork needed to have an HTTP composition technique for services, plus it even had a more efficient HTTP server to use when you needed to allow for HTTP RPC. And now, Typesafe has joined with Spray.<p>This is making Scala look more and more like <i>THE</i> Java successor. Clojure is still a strong contender, but the Typesafe activities have really pushed Groovy out of the ring, as well as things like JRuby and Jython. I doubt that Java will ever go away, but I can see that Scala and/or Clojure will eventually supercede Java as the main development language for the JVM.<p>And this is important because the JVM is showing signs of moving into the dominant position in the new world of massive multicore. It may never muscle out things like Erlang/Elixir or Python, but it will probably be the core dominant platform of this century.",1381947579

I think <i>this time</i> that the explanation that we grossly increased regulation, taxation and even more so the fear of <i>future</i> taxation, government spending and benefits, and just in general have significantly raised the both the direct cost of hiring someone, and the reasonable expectations of future cost of hiring someone is a sufficient explanation. I find the idea that raising hiring costs can be done without resulting in lowered hiring to be, shall we say, something that can only be rationalized by a brain in &quot;politics&quot; mode, rather than &quot;rational&quot; mode.<p>(The test to this theory is that if we elect a regime that tones all of this back, and the economy comes roaring back 1980s-style, then this theory was essentially correct. If we do that, and it does <i>not</i> come roaring back, then my theory here is incorrect. I believe in treating politics scientifically, at least, my personal politics. My highest allegiance is ultimately to what works.)<p>However, lest this sound like a raw ideological rant, I do think it is near inevitable that either by the 2020s or the 2030s at the latest, that this automation displacement will be a real problem. We&#x27;re looking at a world where trucking is gone as a viable job. Where fast-food will probably be rapidly in the throes of total roboticization. Where what farming jobs are still available will be rapidly falling to yet more sophisticated robots that have human-like dexterity and ability to detect ripeness. Taxis, gone, in favor of heavily capital-based self-driving car rent pools. I think this whole automation argument is premature <i>today</i>, but it&#x27;s going to be a real problem in a relatively small number of election cycles. How is anyone who is not suitable for college and has no useful artistic talent combined with enough work ethic to use it profitably going to make it? I don&#x27;t know.",1381947222

On second though, I think I know what is going on.<p>First, linking with the webkit framework is not the problem, <i>using</i> the framework is. I was playing around with preferences and also location. As you say, this is when the Webkit frameworks kicks in, which might explain the memory blowup to 118MB.<p>Second, I seem to recall that modern OS allocators are reluctant to release memory back to the OS (pool) unless required (when available memory is low) hence the process appears to use more memory than what it actual might be using. When I just restart Flux without fiddling with preferences, memory usage stays at around 45MB. I still think this is way too high if you think about what the program is doing, but given the above, even if Activity Manager reports that Flux is using 45MB, it might not really use 45MB now, only at some point.<p>I remember I used Xcode&#x27;s instruments to investigate my program and could then see that the real active memory used by the process was usually much less than what Activity Manager, top, and ps w/friends were reporting. So a large part of the memory the process is currently holding (45MB) might be released back to the OS if needed, I think. If someone has more details on this, please elaborate.<p>Edit: Flux is also running with 4 threads(!) which of course also adds to the process memory usage. Isn&#x27;t a thread stack around 4-8 MB?<p>Also, Flux appears to use 0.1% CPU continuously which is sloppy since CPU usage can be remedied by putting (nano)sleep in the poll cycle to make it use zero CPU.",1381946741

So if it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to automate a task, then employment will occur instead.<p>People are also conservative by nature, so society tends to shun radical new ideas.  That conservatism is why it&#x27;s usually necessary to start your own company in order to put such ideas into practice: almost no one believes it&#x27;ll work until it&#x27;s shown to work, so it&#x27;s rare for big companies to make huge changes to their established business model.<p>Most new companies aren&#x27;t huge successes on the scale of Google because success is distributed according to a power law.  There are only a few big winners, and big winners are the only companies that can influence a whole society.  Therefore it seems mathematically unlikely that most jobs will disappear to automation because most companies won&#x27;t automate unless they&#x27;re economically forced to.  So even if some work could theoretically be done by a machine, most companies will choose to employ people right up until competitive pressure forces them to embrace automation or go out of business.

The availability and quality of public services (parks, schools, government offices, etc.) and, for me, exposure to a variety of cultures, is a huge factor.

My experience is that there simply isn&#x27;t the wide availability of jobs elsewhere as in the Valley, even in places that are &quot;hot&quot; in the start-up scene, and for the most part they are more &quot;enterprise-y&quot; in nature (i.e. software developers belong in the IT department, are cost centers, and should be considered as fungible as our call center staff).

This is just plain a false statement.<p>&quot;Tea Party republicans have nothing to show off to their constituents except for achievements in idealogical concessions from the other side.&quot;<p>They have showed how alike the party leaderships are and are making a lot of people think about third parties.  The 2012 election also showed that the 2012 convention problems were not a fluke.",1381946548

It&#x27;s a conference proceeding, which means it&#x27;s essentially a progress report on a line of research. And small sample sizes can produce compelling evidence if there is a large effect size observed, particularly with the objective physiological measures (subjective psychometrics are much more susceptible to bias). This research is also likely to be supported by other studies, making this essentially replication of an observed effect.",1381946469

Normally the system of checks, and balances actually works so no individual can exploit the entirety... and if they do, they only have a limit time span to cause havoc, at which point the people vote them out.<p>however there&#x27;s two flaws.  A lot of people are putting emphasis on gerrymandering.  Which I suppose is a practical problem that at least has some semblance of possibly being solved.  However to me gerrymandering is really just exposing an even deeper problem, which is a large uneducated populous that is not only becoming uninformed but misinformed... and since we all live in our own bubbles, its really easy to gain confidence that the misinformation we have is true.  Remember that Ted talk a few years ago about the filter bubble? This is a practical reality of its effects...<p>The thing that scares me on a personal level, is I have no clue if the information I take for granted is true or not... and i may very well be just as guilty in voting for the wrong candidates.",1381946411

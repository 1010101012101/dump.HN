We had fresh fruit for one, two weeks after a resupply (from Reunion island, they were actually among the best fruit I have ever had, and not only because they were the first after and before several months of no fruit at all) but apart from that, fruits vegetables were most of the time limited to potatoes, onions and increasingly bad apples and oranges (and that&#x27;s when they didn&#x27;t mistakenly put the fruits and vegetables in the -20°C storage). Really, I&#x27;m not sure how they could keep vegetables much better than we could.<p>(Delicious fresh meat and fish all year round though, but that&#x27;s because we were not in a place as extreme as Antarctica)<p>Otherwise, I had much the same experience, with a dedicated &quot;cinema&quot; actually - just a building with a rather good projector and a computer with large storage.<p>But some people simply cannot imagine life outside the full society with all the amenities their are used too. It&#x27;s fine, and much better for everyone if they already know it <i>before</i> leaving.<p>EDIT: oh right, &quot;a few summers&quot;. Summers have all kind of things available that you really miss in winter. Our chef actually tried to limit the amount of good things he&#x27;d cook during the summer so the overwintering personnel would have it rather than those who were there for just a few months.",1372359728

5954074,comment,5953739,5953739,4,0,feverishaaron,,,"Looking at their usage &quot;graph&quot; (if the relative visuals indicate actual percentages), it appears that IE overall is a very small percentage of their views - perhaps 3-5%. Within that small percentage, IE 8 makes up what appears to be around 20% of all IE users. So they are spending time to optimize for around 1%  and maybe 2% of their total views.<p>I&#x27;d suggest that it probably isn&#x27;t worth it to spend a significant amount of time to support an audience that small. To determine if this is true, the company should track conversions from those using the IE browsers. If they have an average or higher than average number of conversions, one could argue that it is worth the time spent.<p>Otherwise, you are probably wasting significant engineering and design resources to solve problems for laggards who probably won&#x27;t give you any money.",1372359628

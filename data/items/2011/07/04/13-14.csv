Therefore I have dig a little bit deeper.<p>""As of September 2004 the U.S. Congressional Budget Office reported that federal government spending for 2004 was projected to be $2.293 trillion, or slightly less than 20% of the GDP. Of that, $159 billion was for net interest, $486 billion for defense, $492 billion for Social Security, $473 billion for Medicare and Medicaid, $191 billion for various welfare programs, $136 billion for ""retirement and disability"" benefits, and $64 billion was projected to be spent elsewhere."" (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending</a>)<p>Therefore your numbers are correct. It is big work to find numbers for the same year but for example military spending between EU and USA can be compared:<p>""The combined defence budgets of the 27 EU member states in 2008 amounted to 284.9 billion ($406,7 billion). This represents 1.63% of European Union GDP[2], second only to the US military's 477.4 billion ($620.5 billion) 2008 defence budget, which represents 4.5% of United States GDP."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_of_the_European_Union</a>)<p>In this case we still have different agents but military spending has indirect economic effect on different EU countries (e.g. military airports in countries that do not even have its own war air planes).<p>Still your argument is really strong having in mind social security of federal budget's spending. Europe Union has its own budget as well but it is way smaller compared to US federal budget (about 1-2% of EU GDP vs 20% of USA).<p>Finally it is not very good to mix EU and Euro zone (because not all EU members have Euro).",1309787353

But the key is, your 9yo and 11yo trust <i>you</i>, and should continue to do so.  They don't care what you answer when signing them up for Google Mail - they don't even notice discrepancies of that nature.  In the case they do, you tell them why you're doing it.<p>Google did most certainly make Alex cry - in exactly the same way that his hard drive crashing would have done so.  Sure, ultimately it's the parents' fault, in a way, for letting him use fallible computer systems, and that in itself is probably a good lesson, but Google most certainly shares the blame here for boneheaded policies that don't even give parents the option of interceding.

At that age they are also fairly unable to separate fact from ficition and news from gossip.<p>The age limit of 13 seems pretty reasonable to me and if as a parent you think your kid is so mature (hint: he isn't) then it is definitely your responsibility to act as a guardian.<p>Google didn't make your son cry, you made your son cry.

Even if they don't, many people think they do and you can sell them that. Some businesses don't have much money, you may be able to get cake from them. Yes, I once developed a website in exchange for a cake a month. They were some of the best cakes I've ever had. You will move up from cakes and Craigslist as you develop more skill (re: programming, especially databases).<p>Try attending local conferences. I mean conference in the loosest sense of the word as in BarCamp or equivalent. Local meetings with other people doing what you're doing. Some of those people might need development work. If nothing else you'll see what people are up to and get a better feel for the local business.<p>It gets better.",1309785794

Because of this we can know that, say, 60% of Vit D variability is heritable.<p>I hadn't seen a GWAS on Vitamin D levels before you asked your question, but I pubmedded it and it turns out that a small one came out this month: <a href=""http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/13/2739?view=long&pmid=20418485"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/13/2739?vi...</a><p>In short, 4 base pairs (out of 3 billion) account for 2.8% of the population variance of circulating Vitamin D. With such a small # of people, it's not surprising that few independent SNPs hit the genome-wide significance level, but it's still pretty impressive that the 4 SNPs that they found can account for so much of the variance. (In other words, it looks like they identified the source of ~5% of the genetic variance, or 2.8% of the total variance.)<p>This looks much like the lipids story: early GWASs give you a handful of loci with influence, and later GWASs with may more participants will give you a much richer set of loci that collectively explain 20-30% of the variance.

I don't have a lot of time to write much at the moment (see above), but I wanted to let you know it is doable. And worth it. I see far more of my family and have a far more rewarding job than I would if I were working in a corporate environment.<p>In fact, I have a proposed panel in to SXSW on this very topic — your startup and your family would each happily take up your entire life ... so how do you balance the two of them and not fail at both? Once the panel picker opens up for voting (August 9th), I'd love it if you could vote it up.<p>Anyway, there are a bunch of different ways your startup can go, and a bunch of different ways your family can go.<p>On the family side, are there any grandparents nearby? Is your wife supportive of what you're trying to do? Is she income-earning? Are the kids super-needy, or are they older, more capable, and more self-contained? Do you have resources in the community that you can rely on (church members, neighbors willing to babysit for free (or trade babysitting time), etc.)? All of those will help.<p>On the business side, how young is the startup? Are you bootstrapping, or are you looking for investment? If you're going the financed route, have you taken any rounds yet? Are you the only founder, or do you have co-founders? Do <i>they</i> have families? Or are they all single? Those all have a bearing on how things will go.<p>My super-quick story: I mentioned my wife and three kids. I also have a mortgage. And it's all paid for with our bootstrapped small web-business. Most here would call it a ""lifestyle business"", as we've neither taken funding nor are looking for funding for it. I also have a second subscription-based web app (<a href=""http://monotask.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotask.com</a>) that's just about to launch, that I've worked on with a cofounder who also has a wife and three kids.<p>Summarizing <i>my</i> advice (recognizing it might be wildly inappropriate for your goals, as I can't give advice on financed startups), I'd say:\n* build something small that meets a need you either have or see as obvious\n* launch it as soon as you can, and start getting feedback on it\n* don't quit your day job until the side project has proven itself\n* if it doesn't seem like it's going to prove itself, pivot\n* start to hoard your cash now; don't spend any money you don't absolutely need to; this is your runway\n* don't wait to get moving on it: as someone said once, almost every person you'll talk to who's started his own business — whether it succeeds or fails — will say ""I only wish I'd done this earlier.""",1280590503

How can you possibly judge and match that without having some degree of emotional understanding? This is yet again one of those great unsolved problems.<p>On the other hand, there must be a solution beyond simply matching interests from a long checklist. Maybe you should approach it like Aardvark. You could make a friend of a friend based contextual system. Imagine a giant grid of people remotely connected to each other through friends and you parse the daily routine conversations between users and create a personality profile using current psychometric testing (it's seriously inaccurate, but we need a shot in the dark). After that you offer to match them together anonymously at first (this is important) and then see how they hit off.<p>Yet again I doubt that it will work at all due to privacy issues and moreover it will be too computationally expensive to justify...",1280589786

We were wheat farmers, and the majority of that time was spent on a tractor.  Because of the way that we went around the field, the right end of the plow started out next to the edge of the field.  The best view of this was to sit facing the edge of the field (body turned to the right) so you can easily see ahead as well as the right edge of the plow readily.  With a 32-foot plow, some degree of skill is involved in not overlapping already-plowed area (or taking out planted crop during the first round), and not leaving a gap between two rounds.<p>This meant that I did the bulk of the driving with my left hand, even though I am seriously right-handed.<p>And the result is that to this day, my left hand knows how to drive a straighter line than my right hand does.",1280588545

3122408,comment,3118125,3118125,1,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"If Ubuntu has done anything wrong with the full-on switch to Unity in 11.10, it's that it's kindly done us the favour of removing a classic desktop and not even providing anything approaching similar to replace it. I can't speak for Gnome3 since it doesn't like my hardware at all, and its 'classic' mode seems broken (possibly as a result of compatibility issues).<p>Anyway, that wouldn't be a problem at all, but Unity is still flawed, is totally unproductive for development work, and there's a distinct lack of customisation:<p>The launch bar is useless, and doesn't work at all if you let a window snap to the left hand side.<p>You can only add application shortcuts to it (why can't I add bookmark folders?).<p>There are no configuration options to be seen (what if I don't want auto-hide?), and whatever options there are, they're minimal.<p>Workspace switching isn't smooth at all and requires a strange number of clicks to make any use of.<p>Auto-hiding menubars just obscures GUI elements I'd like to be able to see at all times. If they're not there, I have to stop and remember where to look, because I can't just glance at the top of the screen. The actual name of the app is always visible, but clicking it does nothing. This is unbelievably unintuitive.<p>As for it replacing the classic desktop, I'm not sure what exactly was wrong with it, and why a GUI fit for a netbook or tablet is now being shoehorned into a desktop OS before it's had enough care and attention to bring it up to par with the standard desktop experience.<p>I regret running the upgrade and as soon as I can I'm switching to something more productive and usable, because 11.10 and Unity feels like too big a jump into unfamiliar (and unstable) territory.<p>And this is coming from an OS X user (who only uses Linux at work).",1318884751

The discussion is about inequality of <i>income</i>. Taxation doesn't change my taxable income. It takes away part of my income (and gives much of that slice to someone else).<p>The tax cuts you're complaining about are assessed <i>after</i> the income level has already been determined. That is, the salary number on my pay stub is significantly higher than many other Americans. Even if the marginal rate were cranked up to 90%, the fact remains that my taxable income is much higher than many others.<p><i>Both Democrats and Republicans go begging hat in hand and do the bidding of their true masters in Wall Street.</i><p>The bankers aren't angels, no argument from me here. But you're painting an absurdly one-sided picture. Why do you think it is that the bankers need the bureaucrats to ""do their bidding""? It's because those politicians really do hold the power! It's true that the bankers are corrupting our democratic process by looking for favors. But it's <i>equally</i> true that the politicians are corrupting our democratic process by selling favors.<p>And from what I've been able to read from these Occupiers (and I grant that this is just my impression, and I may be wrong), it seems like the ire is directed at those bankers, and that they are looking for the government to help redress the problem. But the government is <i>part of</i> the problem. In particular, they're using their regulatory power as a weapon, hurting us by granting favors to privileged parties. Why would we want to increase the power of that weapon -- ask them to do even more regulating -- when that power is what's enabling the mischief? The only sane answer is to take away their weapon.",1318884708

On the other hand, newer products like Google Pinyin have rapidly picked up in quality, predicting long sentence structures from very little data input.<p>Google Pinyin has evolved to be able to identify sentence structures from sets of hundreds of homophones based on pattern recognition. For example: When I input nzjdhhm to input , Google Pinyin is able to pick out the correct Chinese characters instantly. Even showing a more descriptive input like 'ni3 zui4 jin4 dou1 hai2 hao3 ma,' There are literally thousands of variations for possible homophonic combinations of Chinese characters that can fit this sentence structure. While some constructs are obvious based on patterns, the ability of Google Pinyin to pick out the correct characters is surely related to the fact that this statement has been typed thousands of times.<p>I'm not sure if the failure of Google Translate to improve is due to the inapplicability of the model for translating contextual languages like Chinese, or just a function of the amount of data driving Google Translate. I'm very curious as to why Google Pinyin speaks fluently and Google Translate still speaks at a Kindergarten level.",1318884019

You can write multiple dependent claims (although they are generally disfavored in the U.S. and cost extra in fees). But say you have something like this:<p>What is claimed is:<p>1. A chair comprising a seat and a plurality of legs.<p>2. The chair of claim 1, wherein said plurality of legs comprises four legs.<p>3. The chair of any preceding claim, wherein said seat is made of plastic.<p>So claim 3 is a multiple dependent claim, but the way it would be interpreted is basically as having the scope as if it were written as two separate claims: one depending from claim 1 (thus covering any chair with a plastic seat and some legs), and one depending from claim 2 (thus covering any chair with a plastic seat and four legs). So it's just a concise way of writing something that would logically expand into more than one claim, which isn't really the same thing as multiple inheritance in programming.",1318882358

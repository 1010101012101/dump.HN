And when you do, Twitter is still pretty near worthless. You heard a plane crashed in the river, so you search Twitter, and see a bunch of posts like ""OMG a plane crashed in a river, now I'm going to the gym."" and maybe a picture of a submerged plane. Who cares?<p>You won't destroy Google by building a search service that does nothing but break news 5 minutes before CNN does.",1234144709

472795,comment,472389,472389,0,0,Bjoern,,,"Why a article with such a provocative headline (and so little content) makes the top here at HN is a riddle for me. Might have something to do with the fact that the HN Rules have been floating around too, namely alot of new people around. (Sorry for digressing.)<p>Coming back to the article I want to mention some points.\n(Maybe some things are biased..)<p>Ref. 1.)\nWhile a bigger font size is good for your eyes (hope you guys don't stare to long in one session on the screen) it is bad to understand the bigger picture in my opinion.\nSure you are ""forced"" to write good code, but that is a standard mantra which you should follow anyway. People who like TDD (BDD) aso. have embraced this deeply. Doesn't that huge font size rather reduce your productivity? Please consider this: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000012.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000012.html</a><p>""Its better to have more screen space, not less.""<p>Ref. 2.)\nMaking a syntax element like hard coded strings so much stand out is contra productive in my opinion. It would be much smarter to focus on emphasizing the important aspects of your code rather than over-highlighting strings. No?\nI mean sure, everybody has a different taste and style, but where is the harm in hard coding certain strings? Firstly its fast, secondly this is a typical flame of how far can we eliminate certain things from our code? (instead of embedding SQL use ActiveRecord, etc.) If you want to go so far great, start by embracing e.g. gettext, and put everything is a DB. Oh wait, why is my code so slow?<p>Ref. 3.)\nI fully agree, though why does this whole article sound like a sales story for .net ? \n""Here are lists for a few .net languages: C#, VB.net, F#.""<p>Ref. 4.)\nBasically I agree but ""Ghoulish regular expressions""? If you define it by ""ghoulish"", how about rewriting it to make it more clear anyway? Increase tests by 1%? Uh, well I think with proper input verification you can eliminate alot of problems. I mean its great to work with unittests but a good advice would probably have been, hey please work with unittests its has shown to make code better but if you are too lazy at least use assertions?<p>Ref. 5.)\nInteresting advice, good idea though but if you look at code from ""an open source project"" than it might make you scream and run away. I think this advice is maybe better:\n<a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>\nThis is btw. the perfect article to outline why this whole ""How to manage x in y <time unit>."" is stupid.<p>Ref. 6.)\nGood advice. "".. distraught at just how much room you've got for improvement."" Hm, depends on what my goal is.<p>Ref. 7.) \nInteresting advice, though wouldn't a ""cruicial to your application method"" be rather well programmed? Often it is probably better to refactor the whole function because if its so long that you have problems just writing it from scratch again, then there is too much code in it in the first place.<p>Ref. 8.)\n""And don't just write. Write a compiler!""\nWTH. Please Mr. Justice Gray, could I remind you that the article title is ""8 ways to be a better programmer in 6 minutes."" ? I mean the whole idea of this article is rubbish, (see peter norvig link) but compiler, 6 minutes, what?<p>While I generally agree than understanding ""a"" compiler and what it does. (Scanning, lexing, parsing etc.) Then also implementing one, is very good for your education but it should rather be in your next article of ""how to be a better .net programmer in x years.""<p>General comment:<p>I really like HN, the quality coming from reddit is great, but posts like this are a waste of time. (At least in my opinion.)",1234144540

For instance, in Python:<p><pre><code>  class UnsafeString:\n    def __init__(self, str):\n      self._str = str\n      self._sanitized = None\n    def __str__(self):\n      return self.sanitize()\n    def unsafe(self):\n      return self._str\n    def sanitize(self):\n      if self._sanitized != None:\n        return self._sanitized\n      else:\n        self._sanitized = sanitize(self._sanitized)\n        return self._sanitized\n</code></pre>\nThat way, as long as you wrap all input in the UnsafeString class, you'll have to be explicit if you want the unsafe version and you'll get the safe version by default.",1234142032

472726,comment,472477,472703,0,0,rtra,,,"To further expand on this, we would have a request function returning type IO UnsafeString, and all output functions would have type IO String. By abstracting the UnsafeString type we would make sure its users don't use the type's internal representation (I don't yet know if this is possible in Haskell,) so the only way to use input as of type String would be by asking a private module for a conversion, which would sanitize any dangerous input. Now you only have to look to the input methods to be sure no unsafe input is getting through.",1234141692

472724,comment,470695,471798,0,0,yters,,,"First, to clarify.  By inspiration, I do not mean that someone hears a voice telling them what to do.  Instead, I mean the person has a vision of something higher, outside of themselves, that they try to replicate in their art.  Maybe you already think this, and we're just talking past each other.<p>Homer starts off the Iliad with an invocation of the muse.  Read Plato's dialogue Ion, where Socrates says exactly what I'm saying.  Plus, you will find the same idea in Phaedrus, Republic, and the Symposium.  I'm not saying Einstein is religious.  He's obviously not a theist.  But, he did think his ideas were not merely constructs out of his own mind but following some higher sense of beauty.<p>pg writes a similar idea in his essay on taste:<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html</a><p>He says taste is not subjective, not something people just create.  There is a timeless logic to it.<p>Finally, in closing, here's a relevant cite from the very end of Dante's Paradiso:<p>As the geometrician, who endeavours<p>To square the circle, and discovers not,<p>By taking thought, the principle he wants,<p>Even such was I at that new apparition;<p>I wished to see how the image to the circle<p>Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;<p>But my own wings were not enough for this,<p>Had it not been that then my mind there smote<p>A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<p>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:<p>But now was turning my desire and will,<p>Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<p>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.",1234141571

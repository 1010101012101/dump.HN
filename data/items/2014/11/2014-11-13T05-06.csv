What is truly concerning is that per-capita, it is becoming more and more affordable for agencies to spy on every single person everywhere, all the time.",1415858394

The challenge is that the Windows implementation has one code base while Mono has a complete separate code base.<p>The Mono community was essentially forced to re-implement .NET because no open source implementation was available. Customers have reported various mismatches, which are hard to fix because neither side can look at the code of the other side. This also results in a lot of duplicated work in areas that aren’t actually platform specific. The best way to build a cross-platform stack is to build a single stack, in a collaborative manner. Mono and .NET aren&#x27;t one, but they&#x27;ll be able to work together in an unprecedented way. There&#x27;s Linux stuff in Mono that we would like to use (and vice versa).<p>To answer your last question: Yup.",1415858269

Rules are usually emergent, and these kinds of rules are better suited to the communities they arise in, since they are tailor-made for the circumstances and preferences of the people from which they emerge. Contrast this with Federal rules and regulations which have little or nothing to do with the way life is lived in rural Alaska.

I don&#x27;t get it how breakfast is a completely acceptable time to eat just dessert food -- pancakes and syrop, waffles, oatmeal smothered in sugar honey and cinnamon, cereal, even &quot;healthy&quot; yogurt with sugar in it, toast with jam on it. Not saying I don&#x27;t do it, I eat those things to once in a while without thinking much about it, but in general looking at it, it just seem so strange.<p>There is the whole &quot;breakfast is the main meal of the day&quot; mantra. Is that really true? Not sure anymore. Maybe it is something created by cereal  and bacon producers out there...<p>For the curious, for breakfast, I am used to eating porridge -- buckweat, wheat, oatmeal with butter and salt. Or just rye (I call it &quot;black&quot;) bread and butter (yeah I know bread is sugar too to some degree).  Coldcuts, cheese, smoked fish. Not all healthy and good but most are not sweet.<p>Something that is hard to give up is fatty foods, I like bacon, olive oil on my things, even eat whole cured and spiced pork fat. I would cut slices of it and eat it as a snak. But I am almost underweight for my height.",1415856716

I&#x27;m not sure, but I basically cannot lose weight without that start.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;ve been very tempted to start an intermittent fast (even while not losing weight!) after seeing Michael Mosley&#x27;s program on BBC a few years back.

But society saw that increase as belonging to the business owner who purchased the machine.  Wages fell and fell as worker productivity increased.  Entire families, including children, had to work just to survive.  After a great deal of fighting, and not a little bloodshed, we got the definition of a 40 hour workweek, and society came to see it as proper that a single person working 40 hours a week should be paid a wage high enough that they could comfortably support an entire family.  Society expected employers to share the increased value workers were generating with the workers.<p>We&#x27;re facing a similar situation now.  Computers and automation technology came into the workplace around 1980 or so.  And society sees the increased value workers create thanks to these tools as belonging to the company, not to the worker.  The idea that a worker should be paid enough that they can work 40 hours and provide for an entire family comfortably has vanished.  Now the concern is only that no one be paid above the market rate for their position, and that the market rate be kept low.  Society and the business world was entirely unprepared with the breakneck pace of productivity growth that computers brought about.  The idea of having wages keep pace with the productivity gains simply seemed absurd, as it would require large and frequent raises.  And now we&#x27;ve gotten so far behind, with wages stagnating for decades while companies have grown accustomed to ludicrous profit margins, that any reasonable correction seems ridiculous.

What if it wasn&#x27;t? What if it was something else? You are telling this young man to start a revolution against a company that may have no malice in their intentions. Naming/Shaming companies have real effect. This company doesn&#x27;t seem like a multi-national huge corporation with deep pockets, atleast from their webpage I didn&#x27;t gather that they were. Publicly shaming them may do real damage to the company and people that work there.
If the person <i>really</i> was discriminated against, then go the legal route, sue them and settle it that way. If he was wronged, then law is on his side. Once you win that lawsuit, then feel free to blog and start a revolution because then you have a guilty party. Right now, its just his word against no one else&#x27;s word, they can&#x27;t defend themselves.",1415855416

The data collected is generally uncopyrightable if not reproduced in it&#x27;s entirety without modifications. The relevant case is Feist v. Rural [0].<p>IANAL, but I think the best bet for staying technically legal is to use jurisdictional arbitrage and tit-for-tat to liberate the data. If someone scrapes a US server and are in the US and they generate enough load to deprive the owner of use, then they are technically liable for damages under trespass to chattels. If they instead trade scraping labor with people in other jurisdictions, then that other entity would be liable. There might be some other legal defense/attack that might be usable by the entity who has the data being liberated, but I reckon it would be tenuous at best.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural</a>",1415855370

It requires social engineering, infiltration, or else planting bugs, intercepting shipments, etc. It can be done, and certainly was done, back in the age of typewriters. But it requires some old-fashioned, boots-on-the-ground fieldwork. It&#x27;s a lot tougher to place bugs in embassies today than it was in the 1970s. And in some respects, it&#x27;s logistically tougher than hacking into computers, which can be done from any location on Earth. (Which is not to say that computer hacking doesn&#x27;t benefit from social engineering strategies, of course).<p>&quot;Unhackable&quot; is a poor choice of words -- more like &quot;practically speaking, tougher to hack.&quot; This is a speed bump, not a roadblock.<p>Of course, if the US were to adopt this sort of strategy, we&#x27;d have to make sure we&#x27;re manufacturing the typewriters domestically.

Cows have done <i>pretty damn well</i> considering their spot in the food chain.  Much better than, say, tyrannosaurs or Bengal tigers.  Were I reincarnated and given the choice between a cow and a tiger, would I pick the cow?  Of course not.  But realistically (I use the term loosely given that we are talking about reincarnation), the tigers would all have been taken by nobler and more deserving souls than I, and I would have the dilemma of, say, a cow and a flea.  Ah, I forgot: this is nofunspeak.  So: tigers are independent, fear-no-man humans innately sovereign, cows are their slaves, employees, mistresses, and children, and fleas are property of the horror-state that would be erected if the real estate were not currently occupied (this is likely to be our point of supreme contention, which I must confess boggles my mind.  It seems perfectly obvious that states of some kind are a naturally occuring phenomenon.  I mean, they&#x27;re all over the place.  It also seems obvious that they are easier to get wrong than right.  If only the criminals are allowed to set up states, all the states will be run by criminals.)  Or, in today&#x27;s boredom-state:  tigers are whoever you think of as bogeymen, cows are the virtuous economic producers industrially farming their villes, and fleas are their unkempt IT guys, anarchist commune residents, and (shudder) idealist college students (Reader&#x27;s note: I have been all three of these at some point in my life, so I have some flea cred).<p>Shall we aphorize?  Who is more free, my dog that&#x27;s dumb as a rock and I don&#x27;t allow off my property, or the dead one euthanized as a puppy because I didn&#x27;t adopt it?  I mean, the second one can sit on whatever dog heaven couches it wants, but this seems small consolation.<p>Now at this point it must be addressed: yes, my dog,  by rights, <i>ought</i> to be allowed to fulfil her noble duty of guarding Tibetan shrines.  It&#x27;s good for Lhasa Apso health, according to that article in <i>Nature</i>.  But didn&#x27;t we go over this?  In our bleak world, there are not many shrine-guarding, tiger, or free-from-political-power spots left.<p>Clearly I am treading in moral gray area, because I am contradicting the central dogma of the (world-wide! Tip your local Peace Corps Rep!) American religion, which is <i>freedom ueber allen</i>.  Choice, man!  But I have just demonstrated a scenario that is beneficial enough that both parties would voluntarily agree to it (cow doesn&#x27;t get eaten by wolves, human gets milk), but limits the freedom of one party.  Behold!  Political power, <i>ex nihilo</i>!  And so we see that choice is very easy to lose: give everyone the same amount today, and tomorrow most of it will be in the hands of a few.  This makes voluntary beneficial exchanges rather tricky.  Of course you could periodically reset the amount of choice people had, perhaps by cancelling contracts (Jubilee!), but that reeks of <i>rules</i>, and <i>political power.</i><p>And as for the car: you and I may be happy, but Joe down the street has to breathe the same air.

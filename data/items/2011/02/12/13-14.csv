Not necessarily the best way to build a stable workforce, but in as far as IANAL, completely legal in the US unless it violates an employment contract or industry specific Federal regulations.<p>On the other hand, forcing people to take time off after an extended push probably has some benefits on productivity.

These courses are designed to allow Boston-area developers gain a better working knowledge of Rails.<p>The first workshop, to be held March 3rd and 4th at the office of Fairhaven Capital, One Hampshire Street in Kendall Square, will provide an introduction to Ruby on Rails for software developers with experience in other technologies such as Java, Python, C#, PHP, HTML, and SQL. The second workshop, to be held March 31st and April 1st again at Fairhaven's office, will provide more advanced Rails training, with a focus on scaling high-traffic Rails applications.<p>The courses are open to the general developer community, and with Fairhaven’s sponsorship, will be offered at $600 per course – a discount of over 50% off thoughtbot’s normal rate.  Each course is open to 25 students – if they are oversubscribed, a preference will be given towards developers from start-up companies.<p>Applications are now being accepted at http://workshops.thoughtbot.com/fairhaven.<p>The courses will be provided over two full days, with a networking event held for participants the night of the 3rd and 31st.""",1297517855

From n1256.pdf, the essentially unchanged and freely available draft of the C99 standard:<p>(5.1.2.3.2): Accessing a volatile object, ..., or calling a function that does any of those operations are all side effects...<p>(5.1.2.3.3): In the abstract machine, all expressions are evaluated as specified by the semantics. An actual implementation need not evaluate part of an expression if it can deduce that its value is not used and that no needed side effects are produced (including any caused by calling a function or <i>accessing a volatile object</i>).<p>It does not look like this allows an implementation complete freedom in deciding what constitutes an ""access"". In fact, I'm pretty certain that 'volatile int i; i;' is required to access i <i>exactly</i> once.

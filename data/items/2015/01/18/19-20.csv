Grandmasters do use computers to assist with opening preparation, but it&#x27;s certainly not the case that computers have completely rewritten the opening books.

I have a full time job)...<p>-A load builder, temporary placement scheme creator, and shipping router for a large cattle feedlot in the Midwest (my brother got me this job, while I was working on it a building maintenance man came by, asked about it, told his wife who did data entry for a crop harvesting company and I got the gig below)...<p>-A ticket management and payment system for a crop harvesting company. The original application was in Access, and was slow and clumsy and full of bugs leading to bad payments at times. I re-wrote it using SQL, python and web interface, and host it for the company. Now they can use the application when they are out doing remote harvests (they harvest grains etc. in 4 or 5 states). The owner was pleased and recommended me to a milk producing co-op (below).<p>-Milk production and payment calculation for a 15 dairy co-op. Working on this right now weekends and evenings (I have a full time job). This is a complicated application that takes a number of factors (amount of Butterfat, government fuel prices, amount of bacteria etc.) and calculates payment due to individual dairies. The original app is in Lotus Approach and it&#x27;s been a struggle getting everything out and finding how it all fits together (the person who made the original application passed away). In fact, I should be working on it right now instead of playing on HN. But Lotus Approach is no fun. At all.<p>Not sexy.. but good side work that fills a real need. There are lots of companies that could use an update, or have very specific needs they can&#x27;t fill with off the shelf software.

For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</i><p><pre><code>    sleep 3 | echo &quot;Hello world.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThat doesn&#x27;t really prove anything about data processing pipelines, since <i>echo &quot;Hello world.&quot;</i> doesn&#x27;t need to wait for any input from the other process; it can run as soon as the process is forked.<p><pre><code>    cat *.pgn | grep &quot;Result&quot; | sort | uniq -c\n</code></pre>\nDoes this have any advantage over the more straightforward verson below?<p><pre><code>    grep -h &quot;Result&quot; *.pgn | sort | uniq -c\n</code></pre>\nEither the cat process or the grep process is going to be waiting for disk I/Os to complete before any of the later processes have data to work on, so splitting it into two processes doesn&#x27;t seem to buy you any additional concurrency. You would, however, be spending extra time in the kernel to execute the read() and write() system calls to do the interprocess communication on the pipe between cat and grep.<p>Also, the parallelism of a data processing pipeline is going to be constrained by the speed of the slowest process in it: all the processes after it are going to be idle while waiting for the slow process to produce output, and all the processes before it are going to be idle once the slow process has filled its pipe&#x27;s input buffers. So if one of the processes in the pipeline takes 100 times as long as the other three, Amdahl&#x27;s Law[1] suggests that you won&#x27;t get a big win from breaking it up into multiple processes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law</a><p>Edit: As someone pointed out, my example needed &quot;grep -h&quot;.

But then having gone through that process, why would it be natural to assume that the original album artwork would not be equally in need of licensing if it were to be reproduced in a derivative form?<p>Much of the same arguments apply - if the use was transformative then there would have been no need to pay for the music or the artwork. Yet it was recognised that payment for the right to cover/derive from the music was necessary, so it would seem logical to apply the same perceptual standard to a no-less-copyrighted piece of artwork.<p>Much sympathies to Andy, though, as it doesn&#x27;t sound like a fun time to have to go through something like that over a project that was fundamentally well-meaning.",1421609633

8908529,comment,8906524,8906816,0,0,zaroth,,,"A lot of capital gain, particularly for the middle class, is actually inflation.<p>You buy a house, pay your mortgage for 30 years, and perform regular maintenance. After 30 years your basis is nearly $0 and the market price has gone up 4x-10x what you paid.<p>Now you&#x27;ve paid for the house once, plus all the local taxes year after year. Trivia, how much more should you have to pay?<p>Currently the basis of the house would step-up to market value when you bequeath it to an heir, so no taxes are due. If you take that away, there&#x27;s 30% of the value of the house in federal and possibly more in state taxes that would have to be paid.<p>A $500k exclusion is grossly insufficient. Home ownership is the golden road to middle-class. A tax policy like this is akin to saying you have to be able to buy the house all over again. E.g. If you can&#x27;t afford to pay a 20% down payment (to the IRS) on the house you just inherited then you can&#x27;t keep it.<p>To put some hard numbers in an example, your parents buy a $120k house with a 30 year mortgage in 1970. Due to nothing but inflation the house is now worth over $700k. That is not current income, and should not be taxed as current income.<p>That&#x27;s (one reason) why long term capital gain is taxed at a lower rate.

Most of the work is Microsoft stack web related but mobile apps and api building has been steadily increasing for a several years now to the point that probably 20% of my 2014 revenue was in that space.<p>50-60% of my revenue is sub-contracting. I have a few firms that often take on projects that they are not suited for or do not want to increase staff to cover and they often sub out all or parts of the project to me. These relationships were built through networking with other developers who worked for these companies - never the bosses per se. Meet other devs and when the company needs help, they remember and recommend. In my experience this kind of introduction is about 5x as fertile as a cold intro.<p>Roughly 30% of my revenue is from direct relationships between myself and another company. These tend to merit a higher rate but also increased risk.<p>Very few of my direct relationships start from cold calling/intro (not sure if any ever did actually); most came via word of mouth recommendations of other people. Networking at the right kinds of events can also increase your profile and help you meet the right people.<p>ProTip: Networking at <i>networking</i> events is a terrible idea.<p>Lacking a sales force the best pseudo sales force you can create are acquaintances who understand your skill set and respect you as a person. They don&#x27;t need to see your work, they don&#x27;t need to have hired you before - to drop your name to someone who asks. They need to know your name, what you do and have a generally good feeling about you. If you pay them back for this, even with a simple thank you or lunch - they will continue to be an advocate for you.<p>Another tip which probably falls into the anecdotal evidence category - get off of ODesk and ELance. You are right about the price war. Your name and value to people also gets damaged because you seem to be just another guy among thousands who need to find work that way - it is a &#x27;dime a dozen&#x27; mentality and they will always see you as that.",1421608813

Doing what defense contractors want for the same reason we subsidize corn in Iowa is indistinguishable from having an actual reason when the actual reason is secret.

Have you tried feeding your wife food devoid of known triggers but told her they were in the food? I would hope not, because it&#x27;s not an ethical thing to do, but you need that sort of thing to nail it down. Also, since she seems to accidentally eat food of unknown provenance, can you be sure the times she&#x27;s gotten away with it without symptoms that the food in question was truly devoid of triggers? In others words, it is very very easy to confirm that things are bad for you, correctly or not.",1421608024
8908435,comment,8908022,8908022,0,0,DougHaber,,,"I have written a lot of Perl code over the years, and I also hold the uncommon opinion that it is a great language, and often a far better choice than other similar languages for a lot of tasks. I agree with the author of this article that most people who criticize it are extremely ignorant about it.<p>The most common complaints about Perl tend to be about the code of people who don&#x27;t know how to write Perl. Since when is it reasonable to judge a language on how the amateurs use it, instead of the professionals?<p>Perl does have its warts, but no language is an exception to that.  When you learn to use a language well, the warts no longer matter. You get into the habit of writing code in a way that doesn&#x27;t brush up against them, and that holds true for every language out there.<p>To clarify any mention of Perl 6, you need to realize Perl 6 isn&#x27;t Perl.  It is a whole different language with a really bad name.  I know this has caused great confusion, but Perl 5 is extremely stable, still being developed, and not going anywhere.  You don&#x27;t need your Perl 5 programs to run in a Perl 6 interpreter any more than you would need them to run in a Python interpreter.<p>I have written my share of code in other languages, but I always return to Perl.   As a C and Unix programmer, it feels like a very natural fit in ways that other languages completely do not.  It has amazing string parsing, a superb (though extremely misunderstood) OO system, tons of great libraries, direct interfaces to POSIX and other system interfaces, really good database interfaces, networking, and protocol wrappers, very flexible interfaces to native code, and a really brilliant and well evolved design.<p>While you should always use the right tool for the job, Perl is a better choice far more often than people are realizing these days.  There is so much anti-Perl sentiment out there, and the great majority of it is completely misplaced and made by people who haven&#x27;t properly learned how to use Perl.",1421608022

With influxdb you\n  can log {&quot;section&quot;: &quot;front page&quot;, &quot;user&quot;: &quot;bob&quot;, &quot;browser&quot;:\n  &quot;firefox&quot;, &quot;hits&quot;: 1} as a single metric and then use an SQL-like\n  query to filter by section / user / browser (or any combination of\n  those) as and when you want to.&quot;[2]\n\n  &quot;I&#x27;ve spent the last week working on upgrading our Graphite\n  system. I ultimately killed it and went with InfluxDB. The ease of\n  installation and cluster creation were clear winners.\n\n  Additionally the storage options for Influx trump Graphite across\n  the board. I tried writing a custom backend and it went nowhere. The\n  docs and code are terrible. I also noticed that Ceres hasn&#x27;t had a\n  commit in a year - kind of disheartening.&quot;[3]\n\n  &quot;I haven&#x27;t had the best experience with Graphite. Namely, our main\n  systems practically never crash but Graphite does fall over every\n  few months. Seriously, Graphite is less reliable than the systems we\n  use it to monitor.&quot;[4]\n\n  &quot;We&#x27;ve had the same problems.&quot;[5]\n\n  &quot;My biggest problem with Graphite was that it managed to grind an\n  expensive large RAID array into the ground with a relatively small\n  number (in my eyes) of metrics. We had the realisation that we&#x27;d\n  waste a tremendous amount of hardware or have to cut down\n  drastically on our data collection if we were to roll out Graphite\n  across the board.\n\n  (And yes, we had crashes too)\n\n  The reason for the disk grinding was simple: The whisper storage\n  system is ridiculously inefficient as it does tiny writes all over\n  the places, and an excessive number of system calls to boot.&quot;[6]\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739208"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739208</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739784"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739784</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8740058"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8740058</a><p>[4] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739391"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739391</a><p>[5] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8742242"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8742242</a><p>[6] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739465"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8739465</a>",1421607889

I did have a minor problem with ctypes (explicitly importing _ctypes was required), but apart from that surprisingly smooth sailing.

No modification to the source code needed and I ended up with a nice .exe and a bunch of .dll and .pyd files (including those for numpy and PyQt4).

When the lottery started, it was run by criminals, was corrupt and resulted in a lot of violence by competing criminal interests. By creating state-run lotteries, the situation improved dramatically. Now math is really the only way that people are cheated out of their money, you don&#x27;t have warring organizations trying to control the lottery and at least the government is seeing the proceeds.<p>The lottery may be a horribly-regressive tax, but it&#x27;s better than the situation that existed before it was legalized. It&#x27;s akin to the situation with illegal drugs. If governments started selling them at a slightly-lower price and with higher quality standards, you could still argue that providing drugs to people is making them less healthy. But the situation would be better than what we have today since the states would be making the profit, we&#x27;d be rid of the associated crime and many of the overdoses that result from variable quality of street drugs.",1453431439

Every year there are a large, large number of brand new cars that don&#x27;t get sold, and are marked down when the next model year comes in. Likewise there are structures that get built and never sell out. A building of condos near my house never got bought, so they turned them into apartments for far, far cheaper than they were priced as condos. We overproduce clothes so much that there are several nation-wide retail stores specializing in overstock merchandise for very cheap (TJ Maxx for example). All of these things are places where we have more than necessary production, so priced get driven down to where they are more affordable for poorer people.<p>The person you replied to said &quot;production isn&#x27;t the problem, distribution is&quot;, and you seemed to agree with that in your comment.

If so, I totally agree with you.<p>I would say they&#x27;re in such need as they would take any job offered them, misery notwithstanding, but you&#x27;re 80% with me yes.<p>> I would just like to take a moment to wonder at the shitness of our world where the best we can do for those who have been deprived of everything is to ask them to break their backs so the extravagantly wealthy can make a bit more money.<p>I kind of agree with you here. I don&#x27;t think Bezos is up in his office masturbating vigorously to camera footage of homeless people walking into Amazon warehouses to work. He&#x27;s not hiring them because he wants to make money, in all likelihood most of them will need a fair bit more training than regular blue collar workers who are between jobs or people looking to earn some extra money, and I&#x27;m also willing to bet that a homeless person would be fairly less reliable in terms of showing up for their shifts on time if only for the fact that they literally have nothing including a car. Amazon probably does want to help, and they want to enough that they&#x27;re willing to overlook the problems that come with hiring homeless people.<p>Now we can argue all day about how Amazon could afford to put those people in 5 star hotels for the entire Christmas season and it probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt them, but that&#x27;s not the point. They&#x27;re a company, not a charity. They don&#x27;t need to hire these people at all if they don&#x27;t want to (and if they didn&#x27;t, no one would even be arguing about this in the first place) so forgive me if I&#x27;m not willing to throw them under the bus for at least trying to help.",1453431266

10950437,comment,10942391,10946240,0,0,quanticle,,,">The issues with skeuomorphism occur when the attempt at making a &quot;real life&quot; object imposes restrictions on functionality that would not have existed otherwise.<p>Just because you can do something doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Before relaxing the restrictions on functionality and making everything resizable and customizable, you need to think about the cognitive load that is going to impose on your users. Books are actually a good example of this. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever actually wanted to resize or reflow the text in a book. Most books work rather well with the default settings. I can just pick it up and start reading. I don&#x27;t need to mess with the column layout or scroll settings before I can start doing what I intended to do.<p>The other advantage that skeuomorphism gives you is that you can piggyback on pre-existing user expectations. A dial may be a bit awkward to use with a mouse, but at least I can look at it and figure out what it does at a glance. The same applies to other skeuomorphic UI elements, like 3-d buttons, notebook-like pages, tabs, etc. I can, at a glance, look at all of those things and know what the expected behavior and interactions are.<p>Compare this to Apple&#x27;s flat design or Google&#x27;s material design. Sure, it looks great. But I don&#x27;t know how to interact with it. Is this text a button, or is it just a label? Does this panel move when I swipe on it? Does swiping in from the edge do something? How about pinching to zoom? The fact that so many apps have a modal overlay tutorial on first run should tell us that our &quot;flat&quot; designs are unusable. Yes, having some kind of help that explains what each control does may be appropriate, but we shouldn&#x27;t have to explain how to use the controls themselves.",1453430833
10950436,comment,10921411,10934378,0,0,mdip,,,"I&#x27;m not sure what else I can write to convince you -- I&#x27;ve detailed how I &quot;read&quot; so quickly in a few comments on this topic.  It&#x27;s true but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that unusual (your comment is making me think it may be which I&#x27;ll try to keep from going to my head).<p>I used to work in Infrastructure in the early 2000s and a coworker and I had a running contest on how many certifications we could amass (my company had a library of reading materials).  It was my coworker who pushed me to take a speed reading course.  We&#x27;d each read 600+ page books covering the material around 3 times (maybe 4, but later reads are not complete reads) over a week while testing each other at work.  Both of our pass rates were perfect[1] (Novell CNE, CNA, MCNE, A+, Security+  -- do those still exist? -- and a myriad of other certifications of dubious worth) -- failing meant we had to pay out of pocket, so we passed.<p>The &quot;first read&quot; is a skim/scan, very superficial read, and it&#x27;s easy to get through a large book this way, especially if it&#x27;s material I&#x27;m already comfortable with.  The 1000 page books are technical books (points I made elsewhere) that aren&#x27;t all wall to wall content, lots of diagrams, code, etc.  I read a book more than once if I want to learn the content (the first read is partly to weed out a book that has no value to me).<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s the equivalent time it takes to <i>learn</i> the material that matters.  After a 2 hour &quot;read&quot; (skim/scan/speed-read) of a 1,000 page book, I&#x27;m nowhere <i>near</i> where I&#x27;d be if I had read the entire thing, slowly, word-for-word while taking notes and doing exercises.  If I feel the book is worth it, I&#x27;ll read it again, then read parts of it carefully, to the point where I&#x27;ve likely read the book 3-4 times with notes and exercises included.  I&#x27;m at &quot;equivalent to reading it slowly&quot; by the end of the second read.  But that&#x27;s a <i>low</i> bar for a book of that size.  Considering that same exercise would have taken me a month to complete the <i>first</i> read.  How much of Chapter 4-6 will I remember on day 30 of multi-evening broken-up reading sessions reading it &quot;slowly&quot;?  How likely am I to be burned out by then?  By doing it this way, much more of it is fresh in my mind and (most important to me), I&#x27;m more likely to devote the time to learning the material knowing it will take a week, not a month+, to get what I want out of the book.  After finishing a C++ book recently, I was writing in the language.  I&#x27;m nowhere <i>near</i> proficient, having only two books and a 10-year gap in my C++ code experience, but &quot;the old way&quot; I would have been more likely to let it sit on the shelf half-read, never completing it.  If I did, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to write more than a &quot;Hello, World&quot; program without having it pulled up along-side my IDE, constantly referring to bits I hadn&#x27;t read in over a week.<p>[1] Pass rates, not scores.

Now, we have more people than can be reasonably assigned to do useful work without essentially paying them to warm a chair.

Google search results counts on site-restricted queries are used to return the amount of matching content per site, with some bash and awk glue to string it all together and parse results.<p>As expected, Facebook is huge, as is Twitter.

It doesn&#x27;t seem sustainable long term, but we&#x27;ll see. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem with basic income any more than the current system. The bigger issue I find with basic income is that proposals typically don&#x27;t include any mention of price control on the seller side and purchase control on the buyer side. Poor people are often trapped there because every local actor selling them stuff is trying to maximize rent extraction, and they continually buy things that are expensive and bad for them (case in point the recent cigarette article). Landlords get a lot of money from rent extraction, since they&#x27;re paid in rent directly. It&#x27;s even worse with universal, unconditional basic income. If as a landlord I hear everyone in my apartment complex is now getting an unconditional basic income of $20k/yr, guess what, next year rent prices are going up by around $20k, with lowered adjustments to account for other actors (like local food suppliers) also competing for this extra $20k/person/yr. This is basically the same thing that has happened to student loans. Without <i>authoritarian</i> measures to restrict economic freedom, which in addition to being <i>authoritarian</i> must also be <i>good</i> measures so as to not backfire as every other centrally planned economy has, basic income has no real chance at a large scale.

Syntax is surprisingly dependent upon semantics.  For example, take Swift.  If the last argument to a function is a closure, you can write it outside the trailing paren, like this:<p><pre><code>  let result = myArray.map { element in\n     let x = element.doSomething()\n     callSomethingElse(x, element)\n  }\n</code></pre>\nCan you imagine this working with Python syntax?<p><pre><code>  result = map(myArray) lambda element:\n    x = element.doSomething()\n    callSomethingElse(x, element)\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s even taking some creative license with indentation; it&#x27;s unclear how you would even express this without multi-line lambdas, which were never introduced because they interact with the indentation-sensitive syntax in funny ways.

I&#x27;ve done little with C++ in about 10 years so this was almost all &quot;new material&quot;.  I started on Saturday morning and completed the first read in about 3 hours.  I spent the <i>day</i> Sunday doing the second read, taking notes, but still without exercises.  I spent the remainder of the week on subsequent reading doing exercises in 2-3 hour sessions every night.<p>This book would have taken me a month to read, the first time, before (I recall a Novell Netware book of 800 pages taking me almost a month to complete).  And I would have gotten <i>much</i> less out of it as a result of the gaps of time between topics.  I am not presently a &quot;C++ genius&quot; having read the book, but I&#x27;ve written a few programs and am comfortable with the material.  And I know I&#x27;ll read it again and refer to it.<p>You can&#x27;t become a proficient speed reader over night or with just &quot;some training&quot; or &quot;a course&quot; without a lot of practice.

10950323,comment,10944615,10947407,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"You understand how the economy as an aggregated whole behaves. What you&#x27;re ignoring -- intentionally or not -- is the other face of economics, the hairy & ugly one, distribution. The way that any given person experiences the economy is a product of prosperity (as you put it) and distribution. In this day and age the volatility in distribution reliably dwarfs trends in overall prosperity. There are a large number of individuals who will be hurt by this (or any other) shift many orders of magnitude more than they will be helped. You invoke a collectivist argument to defend these groups&#x27; suffering on the basis that it will benefit the whole according to the economic dogma you hold dear.<p>Fair enough. You might even be right. Even if one were to assume that you are, however, why does it follow that those involved should be happy with their fate as a stepping stone for society? That their complaints are nothing but &quot;childish whining&quot;?<p>Furthermore, the fact that an action creates winners and losers is far less open to interpretation than its ultimate connection to the progression (or regression) of society. If you substitute faith in one system for faith in another then the same argument you made earlier has been made in a million other contexts to defend acts that you would consider unconscionable. In this context &quot;It&#x27;s for the best, honest!&quot; is a weak argument regardless of how convinced you are that your model of ultimate benefit/detriment to society is correct.",1453429120

If you view the constitution as a social contract between the citizens and the government, reducing freedoms of any kind is always to the advantage of the government and always to the disadvantage of the people, even if in the short run fewer people die from firearms-related deaths.<p>Similarly, I would suggest that in terms of privacy, there are people who are willing to sacrifice their own privacy (as well as mine) by outlawing certain encrypted devices because they think that will make us all safer from--something? Are we going to define certain phones and tablets and computers as Assault Devices and make them illegal if they have a pretty fruit logo? Or run an OS named after a cute robot?<p>The problem is that our government is made up of people. People who are trained just exactly the same ways that we are: by positive and negative responses to actions. People who learn by experience that doing a thing that makes their lives easier (removing freedoms) can be accomplished by stigmatizing the exercise of that freedom.<p>Voila. There you have all the explanation of why freedoms are in a constant fight against being reduced. It&#x27;s not because of any conspiracy or because governments are bad by default, or anything nutbaggy like that. It&#x27;s because the basic approach of human nature is to make your life a little easier. That&#x27;s it.<p>Reducing freedoms make the lives of the people in government agencies easier. That&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>My opinion comes from some odd experiences in my life. I&#x27;m from Texas, but I live in NYC. I like guns, but I also support abortion rights. I was trained as a classical violinist but write code for a living. I studied Aristotelian philosophy and categorical, deductive logic; I work on data with inductive methods.<p>I think that a lot of the disagreement between parties is manufactured, that people who care deeply about liberty in whatever form it takes: guns, abortions, free speech, privacy . . . whatever--people who care about these things have a lot more in common than they often realize.<p>I wish there was a better way for us to work together and understand that all freedoms live or die based on our group commitment to all freedoms, not just one or two that we happen to feel good about right now.",1453428258

Sexually transmitted diseases are mostly that because they can&#x27;t be transmitted any other way (other than sharing blood).<p>In fact a number of &quot;sexually transmitted&quot; diseases can&#x27;t be transmitted sexually at all. But apparently it&#x27;s somewhat common for humans&#x27; sexual organs to develop scratches during sex, resulting in blood mixing. So a number of sexually transmitted diseases cannot in fact be transmitted without exchange of blood. And euhm ... scratches are more common with anal or oral sex (sharp teeth near the relevant parts, I guarantee you there&#x27;s 5 tiny bleeding scratches in your mouth right now, especially right after eating and/or stretching muscles and tissues beyond their normal limits ... leads to bleeding)<p>(this is not just true in humans, cats for instance are in fact much worse (due to the hook involved ... women might want to skip looking up what that means), when cats breed, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed that you can find blood on the relevant parts.

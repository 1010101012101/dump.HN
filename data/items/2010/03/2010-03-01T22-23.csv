Also, choose activities that are non-addictive (and recognise the addictive elements in those you do choose) so you can remove them from your life when they are no longer useful.<p>I know that WoW is fun, or EVE online more so (for me) but I stay well clear because I know that way lies madness.<p>HN, Twitter and even Google Analytics are relaxing for me, and all borderline addictive. They also have benefits to my business.<p>Just make concious choices about how you relax and then you are on a good path.",1267484393

The journalists I know are largely resigned to being crapped on by whoever they work for.  They create all the value (similar to a programmer at a startup run by biz-ev guys) while someone makes the money and then gives them a small piece of it. They're use to getting crapped on like this.<p>That said, they're really picky about who they let crap on them.  Someone might let the HuffPo crap on them so they can share space with celebrities and get lots of hits on their story.  Someone might let the NYTimes crap on them, because, it's the New York Times!<p>So if this startup's going to run the same game, they'll need to have a good reason for journalists to want to get crapped on by them.",1267484391

Unfortunately I can't really say how long I spent on it as it intermingles with things like level design and graphics. The levels themselves have a lot of custom code - I wasn't about to make a real level editor for such a short game. And, this being flixel, I wasn't using the Flash IDE to create this.

I really don't believe in it for most situations.<p>It's mostly my tendency (weakness) to focus on developing new features than to update the marketing site. I'll be updating this with pricing very soon since I finally hired a great developer to help out in some of my coding responsibilities and to help shape ZZA's policies and future.<p>-------------
Here's our current pricing:<p>10 cars or less $55.
70 cars or less $125.
200 cars or less $225.<p>No contract. No limit on features. No setup fee.
--------------<p>Here's what we did/considered to reach these prices<p>0. We wanted to serve the startup dealerships. We know how hard it is to start one up (we did it, after all), so we wanted to provide a cheaper entry point.<p>1. We looked at what competitors were charging and what features they were providing.<p>2. We talked to more than 10 dealers to get their input.<p>3. We definitely don't want to convey that we are competing on prices. We're not! We're competing on understanding of domain, features and quality.<p>4. I read some blogs regarding this subject. Like Joel's and some others.<p>5. Had tons of discussions with people who's judgment I trust.<p>6. Estimated at what volume of vehicles would a given price make the most sense.<p>After doing these things, I simply wrote down 10 @ 55, 70 @ 125, 200 @ 225. It <i>felt</i> right.<p>As you can see, it's very non-scientific and many would disagree with this way of doing it. But it's what we did.<p>Maybe when it's time to rethink our prices, we'll have more time for surveys and research.<p>Hope this helps.",1267480851

Those figures were manufactured before we had any indicator that really smart people like Einstein have necessarily high IQs. Just a thought. Lewis Terman.

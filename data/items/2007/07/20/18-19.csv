Did Alexis or Steve pay money for it?  Was it thrown through their window by Diggers in retaliation for building a better social news site?  Was it left behind in the apartment they rented in SF?  Did Scott Stapp seduce Alexis and leave it on the nightstand in the morning?  So many unanswered questions.",1184956829

In C/Java/etc. if you see more than two levels of nested parens you know at a glance that it's code that's hard to follow.  No wonder people's alarm bells go off when they see Lisp.  If they could just relax and learn it, they would find it isn't so hard.",1184955562

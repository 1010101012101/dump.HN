I'm not aware of any Browser that supports Postscript.<p>As for turing complete: SVG is fully scriptable with Javascript, which is turing complete and built-in in every browser.",1229935688

They still charge a full month at a time, but if for example you create a slice for just a couple minutes, they automatically pro-rate it and refund the unused time.<p>Coupled with their API that lets you instantiate new slices just like EC2 instances, they're definitely the closest thing to EC2 I've seen going.",1229934161

406203,comment,406010,406129,0,0,DougBTX,,,"Since you can write down all abstract syntax trees using the same syntax, and you can convert most languages into an abstract syntax tree (all the popular ones), it would be easy enough to write down most languages using the same syntax.<p>The real question would be whether that AST syntax would be better than the language's own syntax. I'm guessing it would be harder to read, since a good syntax for an AST would describe only the semantics of the tree, making it harder to pick out the structure of the language itself.",1229933422

Clojure seems to have reinvigorated interest in Lisps also, but with the benefit of one of the larger available libraries. Should be an interesting decade in language development.",1229933358
406199,comment,405680,405680,0,0,jamii,,,"Thinking back over my entire secondary education this is what I learned:<p>History: Very little stuck.<p>English: I guess I got a lot of practice writing. But at no point did we ever discuss useful things like how to write clearly and effectively. Instead we spent 5 years deconstructing literature, a process which consists of skimming over half the text and then making up flowery rubbish.<p>Geography: Simple physical geography. Weather, volcanoes etc<p>Science: Actually quite a lot. My science teachers seem to have done a fairly good job.<p>Maths: Nothing. Whilst I passed all my exams I didn't really understand anything and left school incapable of constructing simple proofs. I now have a masters in maths so its not like I didn't have the ability either, but most of my first year at university was spent correcting misconceptions I had gained at school.<p>Computing: After 7 years of school I knew roughly how a computer worked but still couldn't write a simple program.<p>Now that doesn't strike me as 7 years worth of education. Most of the counter-arguments on this page seem to come down to the necessity of learning things you don't want to learn. The problem is that I didn't. I, like most people, cannot be made to learn something by fear of examination. It has to be made interesting or useful otherwise I will memorise it, write it down in an exam and promptly forget it.<p>The problem with school education is that it's just not very efficient. I don't think that there's some grand conspiracy to keep the downtrodden masses in their place. It's just that our theories and methods of education are out of date and ineffective. Schools have worked more or less the same way since the 17th century.<p>Even in university I went to lectures where I spent 4 hours every morning for 6 days a week imitating a human photocopier. Mass lectures don't make sense in the modern age. It would be far more effective to just video the top lecturers and let the rest spend their time actually talking to the students, rather than at them.<p>I could rant as well about education being taken over by exams. How often at school did you practice working in groups, collaborating on joint essays, learning to function in a team? I would guess almost never. Because it makes it too difficult to grade an individuals contribution. Did you ever do original research or experiments? Were you given free rein to choose projects? Did you ever see an exam question that made you stop and think? It sometimes seems like the entire education system is built around the fear of cheating.<p>I know its easy to sit around and complain. Its certainly a popular thing to do in geek circles. But we have to recognise that there is a problem in order to fix it.<p>Progress is being made, slowly. The rise of open courseware means that educational materials are no longer being treated as commodities that universities have to protect and keep secret. Once its out in the open artificial selection will take hold and material will begin to improve. The best lecturers now have audiences of tens of thousands rather than just a single room.",1229933270
406198,comment,405557,405998,0,0,kragen,,,"Erlang gets a lot of its syntax and implementation technology from Prolog, but it's true that the distinctive things about Erlang (massive shared-nothing concurrency, supervision trees, tuples, pattern-matching on binaries) have nothing in common with the distinctive things about Prolog (backtracking).  They both have pattern-matching, but so do lots of other languages (even Python to a small extent).<p>I'm pretty sure Prolog is still being used, but it doesn't have the buzz of, say, Fortran or COBOL or Pascal.",1229933254
406197,comment,405557,405731,0,0,kragen,,,"I think I can see how MapReduce could be argued to be a ""game-changer"" (although I'm not sure it's true), but why F#?  If I understand correctly, it's basically OCaml on the CLR.  So you get a Python-like brevity of code (and ease of programming? maybe it has better error messages than OCaml?} with C# performance and access to the CLR libraries.  That sure sounds useful, but why is it a ""game-changer""?",1229933059

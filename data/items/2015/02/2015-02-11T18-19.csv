Forming muscle, pound per pound, takes less calories than burning fat produces. So you can have a calorie deficit while gaining <i>more</i> weight in muscle than is lost in fat.<p>Depending on exercise patterns, precise nutrition, and other factors, a calorie deficit can result in:<p>Weight loss and decrease in body fat % (net weight loss disproportionately from fat),
Weight loss with no change in body fat %, 
Weight loss and increase in body fat % (weight loss from disproportionately from muscle),
Weight gain and decrease in body fat % (weight loss from fat offset by greater weight gain in muscle.)<p>(I don&#x27;t think there is any way for a calorie deficit to result in weight gain <i>and</i> increase in body fat % simultaneously, but I may be overlooking something.)<p>Additionally, changes in absorption, metabolic efficiency, and other factors can make what is <i>assumed</i> to be a calorie surplus based on food/exercise logs into a deficit or vice versa; both the &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; side of calories in vs. calories out are, absent a lot of detailed measurement most people aren&#x27;t undergoing even in inpatient medical settings, a lot more approximate and have a lot more bundled assumptions than people tend to think.",1423680899

Markets are <i>not</i> by any means &quot;efficient,&quot; and are highly vulnerable to getting stuck at local maxima like any other gradient descent algorithm.<p>I think the ability to engage in permission free innovation is actually a much more significant advantage than markets. You could nix the market and implement some kind of socialism and I think you&#x27;d still have a fast, innovative economy if you allowed people to negate the bureaucracy. I&#x27;m not saying markets don&#x27;t have advantages, just that they&#x27;re not a panacea.<p>I saw this when I worked as a government contractor. There was an incident within the org where I worked that had the effect of temporarily suspending the bureaucracy, and for that brief period of time it innovated like a small agile private company! Everything felt like it went vertical. Then the bureaucracy came back and all innovation halted. Now you had to ask permission, so nothing could happen.<p>Thing is: as the size of a corporation approaches &quot;big,&quot; its internal procedures and politics start to resemble government. Microsoft, IBM, and yes even the venerable Google start to look a lot like government agencies internally. As they grow they take on a lot of government&#x27;s problems, like sclerotic bureaucracy.<p>The meta-corp model avoids this by allowing individual &quot;departments&quot; to function with an extreme level of independence. It uses mechanisms like equity finance to capture upside while creating enough autonomy to allow permission-free innovation.",1423680691

9034718,comment,9033149,9033149,0,0,nadams,,,"Disclaimer: I went through college and currently teach part time. I wish something like github was around when I was in college - I only got into self-hosted SVN repos near my senior years. As a professor - I believe in transparency when it comes to my classes.<p>tl;dr; What should have happened is that UofI should have worked with github to turn those repos into (free) private ones. That way the content is removed from the public and search indexes and the students can still use/review the material they created in the class later on if they want to.<p>I have only taught 3 classes/2 subjects - object oriented (heavy programming), and operating systems (light usage). I run my own source code hosting service and will pre-provision private repos for them (for free obviously). I also encourage them to get private repos from github (you can get it for free if you need it for a class) if they don&#x27;t like mine (I am not one of those teachers who force them to use their book or service - students are free to use whatever resource they want....just maybe not CVS or RCS...).<p>I strongly recommend private because obviously I don&#x27;t want other students to copy their work (but I do encourage collaboration for homework). However, most of my assignments are pretty open-ended to the point where I would notice obvious plagiarism. A few students have created public git repos because they aren&#x27;t familiar with github or even git - which I am perfectly fine with. I would rather change my assignments than force a student to take down their git repo (which I should probably do anyways). The last thing that I would want is for a student to have a negative association with using source code hosting services like github.<p>Some comments suggest that the university may claim ownership over the code - which may be BS depending on how the code was acquired. The university may have paid some guy off the street to write this code and the university hired a professor and said &quot;you will use this code to teach your class&quot;. If this was the case - then I could be ok with this takedown. If a professor wrote it in their spare time for the class and the university is trying to claim ownership - then I have a problem with it.<p>This does make me wonder - how many students requested private repos for their classes and shoved the code there? They won&#x27;t have their code taken down obviously - so the only people who are punished are those trying to learn and understand the class and git/github.",1423680642

I am fine reading resumes that are up to 5 pages in length (but many people aren&#x27;t).<p>* Suck it up and set up a Latex resume.<p>* You&#x27;re not an expert - if you are, you&#x27;d not be looking for entry level positions, and you <i>likely</i> wouldn&#x27;t be a hobbyist. You&#x27;d probably have a history of consulting in your expert field.<p>* You need to put titles in your positions. While useless in precision, it gives a sense of the order of magnitude of responsibility your organizations saw fit to grant you.<p>* &quot;Responsibility -> Action -> Result&quot; is a good triplet for resumes.

9034660,comment,9032598,9034155,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"No.  The rules come from different languages, but once the word is considered an English word, only the orthography matters.  If you make a new word by combining skip and hop into &quot;skiphop&quot;, someone may mistakenly pronounce it [ski-fope] rather than [skip-hop], despite the fact that neither &quot;ski&quot; nor &quot;phop&quot; are identifiable as Greek roots, because phi makes an &#x27;f&#x27; sound, and that makes the subsequent &#x27;o&#x27; vowel pronounced as the &#x27;o&#x27; in &#x27;phobia&#x27;.<p>Knowing the etymology helps, but is not necessary.  When linguistic researchers create nonce words for their experiments--words with no etymology at all, like &quot;gluff&quot; or &quot;splim&quot;--they find that people still generally pronounce them in the same ways.<p>They also find that people impute meanings to the nonce based on structures found in the word.  For instance, when given the nonce words &quot;plorkish&quot; and &quot;erildophate&quot;, and told that they are synonyms, subjects may claim that the latter is more sophisticated or scientifically precise.  Or perhaps they are told to match the word to the person who spoke it, and a significant fraction of subjects match the words to the pictures the same way.<p>You can do the test yourself.  Print out photos of Bill Nye and Kanye West.  Write out &quot;plorkish&quot; and &quot;erildophate&quot; on index cards.  Tell people the words are synonyms, and ask them to match the word to the photo of the person who said it.  If they don&#x27;t swing at least 60% in favor of West=plorkish and Nye=erildophate, and pronounce the words the same way, I will eat a tiny portion of my least favorite hat.<p>I claim bonus points if they also use them in a sentence or identify the part of speech as adjectives.  Perhaps ask your subjects to also guess the sentence their chosen person spoke when using the word.<p>People do actually get paid to test this.  This might be a good Science Fair project, actually.",1423680224

This has been found to work for weight loss; you give a normal-weight donor&#x27;s microbiome to an overweight person, and they lose weight a significant fraction of the time.<p>So, when I read:<p>> the woman received a fecal transplant from her overweight but healthy daughter, via colonoscopy<p>I cringed. There are <i>three</i> things wrong with that. First: you don&#x27;t need to use a relative, because fecal transplants don&#x27;t have risk of rejection. Second, you wouldn&#x27;t use a donor who&#x27;s overweight.

I think it would be great if Smalltalk fans could replace Javascript with Smalltalk, if I even had a real option of using Smalltalk (and the differences between Smalltalk and Python can easily be overstated). Even in the absence of a standard bytecode, I have no problem with better things battling it out, as a way out of an artificially maintained monoculture based on a language with unusually many and severe design flaws.<p>Meanwhile, asm.js is presented as a bytecode which just happens to be a horrible kludge. Why couldn&#x27;t we have designed a proper bytecode, again?<p>I can drag my feet through Javascript because I have had to for years, as if it were a temporary arrangement, but why does anyone feel happy to think that we are going to have to deal with the same horrible decisions in 20 years? Can I see something that even tries to be better just before I die, at least?",1423679402

It allows for precisely this kind of thing. Unfortunately, because it was designed by committee, it&#x27;s apparently not very good, and it&#x27;s hard to actually get a setup that works with it properly. Notably, any kind of receiver in between your device and your TV usually causes it to not actually work, or for only parts of it to work (commonly, the receiver allows for power-on but blocks remote control).<p>In my case, I have my PS4 plugged directly onto a Panasonic TV. When I turn on my PS4, the TV turns on automatically and switches to the right input. And similarly, if I turn my TV on when it&#x27;s on my PS4 input, or if I switch to the PS4 input after turning it on, the PS4 automatically turns on. Curiously, turning the PS4 off does <i>not</i> turn off the TV. Admittedly, this behavior can be annoying, because if I turn off my TV while it&#x27;s set to the PS4 input (which is maybe 75% of the time), I can&#x27;t turn it on again without the PS4 immediately booting up, even if I wanted to switch to another input. What I wish I could do is have the TV turn on automatically & switch inputs when turning on the PS4, but not the other way around. Another thing this feature does is let my TV remote control my PS4; for example, I can use the arrow buttons on my TV remote to navigate around the PS4 home screen. This is potentially useful for watching movies, although I haven&#x27;t ever actually experimented with it.<p>Note that getting this to work requires turning on some settings that are ordinarily disabled. I didn&#x27;t even know the PS4 had this capability until I started googling for what one of the disabled settings meant. Somewhere in PS4&#x27;s settings there&#x27;s an off-by-default setting called &quot;Enable HDMI Device Link&quot;. Turn this on. Then check your TV settings for something similar. On my Panasonic there were two settings &quot;VIERA Link&quot; and &quot;Power on Link&quot; which needed to be on for this functionality. On Sony TV&#x27;s it&#x27;s probably called &quot;Bravia Sync&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a Polygon article with some more info: <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/21/5126628/ps4-remote-control-hdmi-cec-tv-sony-samsung-panasonic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/21/5126628/ps4-remote-control...</a>",1423678824

I&#x27;m very in favour of spreading this analysis, but I&#x27;m afraid that there might be some sort of bias going on (for example, I really want to adjust for industry, because I suspect that tech and media companies are leading this trend, while materials are not).<p>Edit: Just saw that this is an interactive notebook!

But, to me, the point of ISO 216 adoption in place of US Letter (and other common sizes) is about having a general-purpose/common-use aspect ratio with inherent properties that help simplify things across the board for a lot of people. If it wasn&#x27;t already used so much elsewhere, I&#x27;d be a &quot;harder sell&quot; (even to myself). But, it is used elsewhere... a lot... and has beneficial properties too. Trying to clean up the mess and simplify the chaos. Remove the unnecessary extra baggage associated with other systems.<p>Aside:  If I was king of Sun III (previously known as Earth), my replacement for &quot;US Legal&quot; sized paper would be 210mm × 340mm.  This maintains the width of A4, but gives it a length similar to that of US Legal.  Moreover, it achieves this using the Golden Ratio. Calling it φA4 for the time being.<p><pre><code>    US Legal..:  8.5”  × 14” (Before mm conversion.)
    US Legal..:  216mm × 356mm —> approx. 1.647:1 ratio

    A4........:  210mm × 297mm —> approx. 1.414:1 ratio
    φA4.......:  210mm × 340mm —> approx. 1.619:1 ratio
</code></pre>
See <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/S0rrRnP.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/S0rrRnP.png</a> for an example.<p>Aside: Apparently the 210mm × 340mm size is used for some folded paper towels and some pastry bags already.  Also, Mexico&#x27;s &quot;Government-Legal&quot; is 216 mm × 340 mm — same height as my proposal but with a 6mm width difference. (Theirs matches US Letter/Legal width of 216mm instead of the A4 width of 210mm.)",1423677647

Every time I have to deal with even the most minor of DRM I am annoyed.  If I have to put in a disc for a game I have already installed, it makes me actually dig out that disc.  Registration codes annoy me to know end, especially very long ones.  I am a veteran and still work with the government, in my job I could wind up without network access for some period, so I do not even think about buying a game that requires network authentication for the single player version.<p>Any time an illegal, cracked version of a piece of software is superior in usability to the legitimate version, I consider that a major problem.<p><i>Everybody in the game industry knows that ""cloud computing"" is the future.. </i><p>This may prove true in the long run, but I find it far from obvious and it certainly is not true right now.<p>Remember that there are people (people deployed in the military come to mind, also some rural areas even in America..) for which consistent network access, much less fast network access is a luxury they do not always have.  This may change in the future, but it is going to hold true for a while still.<p>Also, there are some people that just do not like the idea of their software needing to check in and report back.  They do not like it for privacy reasons and because they may like being able to play retro games long after they are unpopular and forgotten about by most.<p>Cloud computer will definitely affect gaming (already has to a degree), but I think the idea of it being ""the future"" for all or even most games is not obvious",1275000991

Let me also say that I think approaches like battle.net are much better than DRM.<p>But, they do not necessarily need to stop piracy.  What they need to do is earn a reasonable and healthy profit.<p>They could (potentially) do this witout worrying about piracy at all.  They would benefit from preventing all piracy that would otherwise have been a sale, of course, but if they are earning a profit even this is only beneficial, not necessary.  The piracy that would not otherwise have been a sale is simply irrelevant to the company's health.  In fact, in some circumstances piracy that would not otherwise have been a sale could be beneficial to them by providing publicity and helping to gain a fan base that will eventually make purchases (again, this should not in any way be read as condoning piracy, but it remains true.)",1275000405

We were not planning on getting the user's card information during initial sign up. Our rationale for this was that we wanted to make the initial sign up process as easy as possible. I also assumed that it would reduce the likelihood of chargebacks.<p>Once the user signed up for their account, they would be able to use the application and save their card information in the application at their convenience. If, after the 15 day trial, they still had not entered their card information, their installation of the application would become ""locked"" until they entered their card info.<p>Are there good reasons why this is an inadvisable strategy, and why we would want to get the card information <i>before</i> the trial period begins?<p>Thanks in advance for your input.",1274998922

It only costs so much because our lifters are hideously inefficient.<p>The reason rockets are so inefficient is that we don't know how to keep cracks from spreading through our structural materials, so we have to derate their strength by huge factors to get reliability.  Nano- and micro-composite materials look like they will be able to vastly improve this situation (and indeed already are in the latest jetliners), and the rocket equation gives big big cost savings for weight savings.  High strength materials are also good for rotovators and other semi-passive lifters.<p>Another big opportunity is to shift some of the propulsion to the ground.  It should be straightforward to shine launch lasers up the tail of a standard rocket and reduce its propellant requirement by many percent, which the rocket equation then multiplies into a large cost savings.  Exclusively laser launched vehicles are also possible but speculative at this point (they need visible light lasers to get range but those are still too inefficient).  Most of the necessary technology exists or can easily be built.  All we lack is the optimism to make the investment.<p>As for getting metal back, the asteroid belt is energetically close despite the distance.

Burger King for lunch, a loaf of bread a day, hardly any veggies but massive amounts of cheap carbs and meat. I was technically overweight, because I put on so much muscle and I&#x27;m not a tall guy. Obviously I did no gym-type exercise. No-one, looking at my diet, body-mass, or lifestyle data would think I was fit, but I was all muscle and in the best shape I&#x27;ve ever been.<p>The older guys I worked with could lift more than me, for longer, with less visible effort. You&#x27;d never look at them and think they were fit, and they ate like pigs too. Again, if you looked at their data they&#x27;d be a huge diabetes risk. But they were fitter in their 40&#x27;s than I was in my 20&#x27;s, and I was pretty fit back then.<p>Now, 20 years later, after spending most of those 20 years sitting on my arse pushing little buttons, I&#x27;m going to the gym and eating well (diabetes is an effective motivator!). Look at my data now and I&#x27;m a bit overweight, but with a good diet and exercise regime.<p>But compare me with my good diet and exercise regime to those older guys who spent their working lives doing physical labour and eating like crap, and I&#x27;m a weak, blubbery mess.<p>Either the &quot;fitness&quot; they&#x27;re measuring isn&#x27;t what we understand to mean by the word &quot;fitness&quot;, or they&#x27;re not measuring actual fitness.",1453089429

I&#x27;ve spent some time living in France and that certainly seemed to be the case.  Status quo meals in the US?  Terrible.

There is no such thing as &quot;good food&quot; if you push it to the limits and eat too much of it. Celery has a lot of active component, just smell this taste and you will know. It is mainly good but as an addition to a normal meal&#x27;s main component, which is traditionally white rice or noodles in the East, bread or potato in the West.<p>Among these I would guess the best is rice. But even rice you cannot eat 50 pounds of eat without harm.<p>I think the main issue here is that food is not science, and should not be the subject of science. Some chemical reactions are, but not nutrition. Nutrition is a cultural thing, much more connected to health, well-being and social living than to chemical reactions, milligrams of whatever and parameters of our bodies.",1453089066

He decided to do a series of ethnographic nutrition studies in villages in Switzerland, Gaelic communities in the Outer Hebrides, Eskimos and Indians of North America, Melanesian and Polynesian South Sea Islanders, African tribes, Australian Aborigines, New Zealand Maori and the Indians of South America during the 1930s and find out what common denominators they had in their diets that contributed to their great teeth and good health.

What I said is that it has multiple causes, some bad (lack of social mobility) and some good (Larry and Sergey starting Google).</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting and probably important that he doesn&#x27;t actually come out and say whether or not he believes economic inequality to be a bad thing, either.<p>There is significant evidence that a high level or economic inequality has bad consequences for people - it can literally be bad for your health, via psychological mechanisms. This is important since if inequality is bad in itself, then you might want to eliminate some of the ostensibly good reasons as well, after having eliminated the bad reasons.<p>So instead of taking a stance on the badness of economic inequality (yay or nay), he bangs on the drum that one should first go after the <i>bad</i> causes of economic inequality. I doubt anybody else in the discussion would disagree with that, which makes the whole first point rather pointless.<p>On point 2, &quot;<i>So you could for example have no poverty and perfect social mobility, and still have great economic inequality.</i>&quot;<p>Does pg realize that perhaps somebody might not agree with that? This seeming lack of understanding makes the second point rather pointless as well.<p>On point 3, &quot;<i>I called out lack of social mobility as one of the worst problems contributing to economic inequality</i>&quot;<p>Is he aware of the argument that economic inequality can reduce social mobility?<p>Since I doubt that pg is wilfully ignorant of the potential subtext that goes on in the heads of the people he responds to, I can&#x27;t help but have the impression that people are talking past each other. I guess part of the problem is that the people he responds to aren&#x27;t making their arguments very well (at least from the perspective of a highly technical mind), and another part of the problem is that pg seems to be insufficiently aware of the large body of work on the topic in disciplines outside his &quot;home turf&quot;.",1453088837

10922419,comment,10921938,10922188,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I think you need to step back even farther: what is the point of money?  If you don&#x27;t have a good answer to that question, how can you reason about the benefits and drawbacks of different ways to distribute that money?<p>I&#x27;m going to out on a limb and suggest that the point of money is economic growth.  This may seem like a circular argument, so let me expand on that a little.  Imagine you have a farmer.  This farmer wants to grow food and he has plenty of land.  However, he does not have enough seed to plant all of his land.  He has nothing to barter with until after his food is grown, so he ends up &quot;wasting&quot; part of his land (letting it go unplanted) because he could not get enough seed.<p>In this scenario, everybody is a loser.  The farmer grows less plants and will not be able to barter for things he needs in the future.  Society also gets less plants.  So it makes sense to give the farmer more seeds so that he can plant his whole field.  In fact, because he can do that, he can repay the favour in the future by giving up some of his fully grown plants.<p>Money is a kind of token that can be used to trade for things.  It is very useful for society to give people money if they will use it to trade for things that they need, which will in turn produce things that will improve the quality of living for everyone.<p>Money that is piled up and not spent is not helpful to the economy or society.  If there were a limited amount of money (and in some ways there is), then we could say that people who hoard money are a burden on society because they stop people from making use of that money to improve society.  Ideally we would split up all the money in the world and give whatever amount is needed to the people who would be able to use it.  In a really ideal world, each person would be motivated and able enough to spend the money in a way that would produce benefit for society.<p>Of course this is not the case.  There are many people who hoard money (bad).  We can also see that there are people who would spend money improving the beer brewing industry (maybe not so bad) at the expense of investing in life saving medical research (arguably seems better than beer in some ways).  In fact, quite a lot of people simply want to consume goods and distribute money around, as opposed to trying to improve things.  Those people are at best neutral to the system, though better than the hoarders.<p>From a societal point of view, it is best to distribute money in a way that maximises people&#x27;s ability to use it beneficially, while minimizing people&#x27;s ability to hoard it or distribute it arbitrarily (buying shiny useless toys or food/shelter that they don&#x27;t need).  So already we can see that depending on what people want to do with money, it is beneficial for society that there is an inequality.<p>Having said all that, I think that the inequality that we have reached at the moment is far from ideal.  Now the really interesting bit is that what I wrote so far seems to favour a fascist economic system.  I suspect we can do better, though ;-)",1453088490

The Lightning intercepted U-2s, flew as high as 88,000ft (27,000m), and in a NATO exercise in intercepting Concorde, was the only fighter to do so leaving F-15s, F-16s, F-14s, Mirages and F-104s behind.<p>A fun anecdote involves airframe XM135 (which is still preserved at Duxford if you are in the area, as well as an incomplete TSR-2) [5] [6]. A persistent electrical fault that appeared only when accelerating meant that the people working on the jet had to accelerate it. Whilst taxiing, with the ejector seat on safe, no canopy, and wearing only noise guards (so no radio), Wing Commander “Taffy” Holden accidentally went airborne. He had a few hours in a Tiger Moth but nothing comparable to the Lightning (“I had never flown a jet aircraft, no”), so he had to figure out how to fly it, and since he couldn’t eject, how to land it, which he did eventually after three attempts, contacting Air Traffic Control via hand signals.<p>On another note, the most performant Cold War aircrafts flying in the US today are probably the two FAA-approved brand new SU-37s from Pride Aircraft [7] which were sold by the Ukrainian Air Force with zero hours on either the engines or the airframes and completely Westernised with English language controls and modern electronics.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_City"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunder_City</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Lightning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Lightning</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_TSR-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAC_TSR-2</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnGXerN0tlo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnGXerN0tlo</a> (Jeremy&#x27;s jet fighter garden feature - Speed - BBC) “Do you stock Lightning jet fighters?

Using 64-bit integers, I don&#x27;t think you can turn Grisu2 into an failure-free algorithm. However, you can definitely improve its reliability by handling special casing small integers (as is done in Errol2/Errol3). By my estimates, this should improve Grisu&#x27;s success rate from ~99.5% to ~99.95% [see math at end]. The remaining 0.05% is far too large to for enumeration and using a lookup.<p>If you are willing to print numbers that are correct but possibly suboptimal, you can also use Errol2 and modify it to remove checking. This will give you the speed of Errol3 without having a lookup table. I might look at making such an implementation and maybe call it Errol2b.<p>[math for calculating approximate error rate]\nWith an input floating-point format with p bits of precision and an intermediate format with q-bits of precision: the &quot;chance&quot; of value failing is close to 1 in 2^(q-p).

So, let see some of them.<p>Ok, we shouldn&#x27;t look at indicators of inequalities (the Gini Index for example), but we should look at inequality effects. Well, there&#x27;s a lot of literature looking at it and finding that the Gini index is an acceptable proxy for the other measures (acceptable is kind of fuzzy here, bear with me). We also know that a Gini index of 1 doesn&#x27;t mean perfect equality. This because it depends on the definition of equality and on what you measure. Also, we know that a little bit of inequality is not only acceptable but required to foster social mobility (and it is probably part of PG&#x27;s argument). How much is the problem! But saying we shouldn&#x27;t look at inequality index but at the underlying issues and  the individual cases is as much a misguided suggestion as suggesting a startup to stop looking at DAU/MAU.<p>But even if we discount this critique as futile. Do we really think that reducing a little bit the inequality will stop startups? If we setup the system in a way that Page make just 10 billion dollars instead of 15 billion out of Google (I&#x27;m making numbers up) he would have decided for a clerk work instead? Is he seriously saying that? And then, wasn&#x27;t him (to be honest, could have been Sam Altman) that said that you shouldn&#x27;t start a company to become reach but because you think you are the only one able to solve this issue? I know it sounds like a straw man argument. It is a sort of. But I believe in the law of diminishing return. I believe that I started a startup because I was determined to solve a hard problem, not for the upside (although it was important, but I was smart enough to know that the probability of making big money were really small and other investment had better returns).<p>Then there&#x27;s the point of variation in productivity that is so fuzzy my head exploded. What does he mean by that? Which his the definition of productivity he is using? Seriously, that&#x27;s a problem. Because if he defines productivity by the ratio value individually produced/hours, I wonder how he estimates the value produced in the last week by Larry  Page. By Google&#x27;s value? And how he approportionate the value produced between Page and the thousands of people working for Google. Even for a simple example, how do you compare a productivity of a woodworker making chairs and a steelworker making swords? You could count the unit produced per day, but they are different products. You could assess the market values of their output, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the value of their output changes between peace time and war time without their productivity actually changing.<p>Finally, it comes the last issue. He acknowledges that there&#x27;s a small number of startup founders coming from poor backgrounds. I don&#x27;t have data about that, so I believe him. Yet, I don&#x27;t think determination is something lacking from poor people; it is the opposite! So, which is the problem here? Well, my little anecdotal experience tells me that when your parents could help you, you could go for the long shot, but if you need to eat, it is better to find something that give you the food quickly. It doesn&#x27;t go against his argument, actually, kind of make it. But I wonder why it didn&#x27;t make it explicit.",1453086453

(remote, Charlottesville, VA)<p>About Us: Our products help our customers measure, analyze and understand system behavior at a very deep level. There are good tools in the application and network layers, but usable tools for servers and databases are practically nonexistent. Were fixing that, focusing first on tools for MySQL.<p>DevOps Brainiac<p>Our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (its awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL, Cassandra and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is ""we need another backend/infrastructure engineer.""<p>Front End Brainiac<p>The web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP, D3, Angular, etc., and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.<p>Email us at jobs@vividcortex.com if interested.<p><a href=""https://vividcortex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vividcortex.com</a>",1362167945

5306577,comment,5306155,5306155,20,0,lobster_johnson,,,"I like the way people are starting to look at alternative approaches to text editing. Light Table has some good ideas, for example. For me, multiple cursors and fast symbol navigation in Sublime Text has been a huge time saver.<p>Personally, I have never needed code folding (I prefer to have my own map of the code in my head, and anything that obscures that map just gets in the way), or Sublime Text's minimap, nor have I ever needed the symbol sidebar that is found in some IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans). What I really want is <i>more efficient editing</i>.<p>For example, text editors like Sublime have zero language-sensitive refactoring support. I can't rename (variables, methods etc.) or  extract methods, for example. Even some really simple operations like ""select entire current nesting level"" are unavailable. I remember using Eclipse 7 years ago and really liking the intelligence of the incremental compiler backend, even though I hated Java; it seems that with backends such as Clang, those tools can once again be applied outside big, annoying IDEs like Eclipse and Xcode.<p>Not sure if this particular approach is useful except to a small niche, but it looks pretty slick. Good luck with the effort!",1362167782

5306523,comment,5305993,5306396,1,0,lutusp,,,"The reason I replied to the article is that I see too much peudoscience being put forth as science. And this matters very much -- there are groups in society who want science's status without the discipline. Creationists and Christian Scientists are just two of many examples.<p>My point is that, below an easily detected threshold, it's no longer science. It may be part of an overall scientific enterprise, but to call something science that depends on someone's personal tastes or preferences is very misleading, and may grant credibility to activities that don't deserve the name ""science"".<p>> until a hypothesis gathers enough supporting data to become a principle, the process of science at the margins is inherently social.<p>Yes, which is why we have science. Science is a method to get around humans' predisposition for distorted thinking. If humans were rational, there would be no science -- what we call ""science"", those rational creatures would call ""thinking"".<p>My point is that, when science becomes social, it's at the border of science, at the border of anything useful. And it may explain why most published research findings are false:<p><a href=""http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a><p>> I didn't even get into matters of ethics and politics. For example, there are important medical principles today that were gathered through highly unethical (and regrettable) research in the early 20th century; if similar experiments were performed today, the experimenters would be vilified and the results discarded out of principle, even if it was robustly scientific with a significant impact.<p>Interesting example. It turns out that scientific results are scientific results regardless of their origins. We should do all we can to prevent travesties like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment</a>), but once the data have been collected, it would be foolish to throw them away because of their origins.<p>> ... and the results discarded out of principle ...<p>Not really. Most studies that are carried out with appropriate scientific discipline are accepted as legitimate, regardless of their origins. Remember that scientific experimentation is not about whether a result makes us feel good, it's about whether the result reflects reality.<p>For those reasons, the Tuskegee researchers should all be thrown in jail, the public outrage is entirely justified, policies should be put in place to prevent any such thing from ever happening again, but the results should not be discarded. And, as it happens, they weren't.",1362167248

In any case, since this is a startup, there is a ton of opportunity to grow and help us build an empire.  Our first salesperson could easily wind up VP of Sales or Chief Marketing Officer or something down the road (if they are interested, of course).<p>We're also open to adding another technical person to the co-founding team.  The right person would need some seriously strong technical chops, with a background in the JVM world, preferably with some or all of:<p>serious Groovy/Grails experience, strong knowledge of various persistence mechanisms (relational databases, graph databases, document databases, etc), experience with Lucene, Mahout, jBPM, Activiti, Camel, Jena, Solr, and/or Hadoop.

A double extra super bonus would be any experience or background as a business analyst or similar role.

All of that has given me perspective that seems lacking on some entering into these religious conversations.  I don't even know how many code editors I have used over the years.  I probably couldn't list them. I've even had to write some of my own.  The point is that across all of those technologies, platforms and years, this has never mattered.  The text editor has never --ever-- played a significant role in the factors leading up to the quality, schedule, success or failure of a project.<p>If you like using vim and messing with it.  That's OK. I use it too when I work on Linux.  No issues there.  Now, to go to the extreme to say that one is not a professional programmer if one does not use vim (I claim I have seen many times) is, well, nonsense.<p>In addition to that someone chose to call me a fool who does not know what he is talking about.  I felt the incomplete list might be a reasonable superficial qualifier.  Not enough?  My email is in my HN profile.

There far more important and useful places to spend your learning hours than learning to use a shit editor with a shit UI that originated at a time keyboards had half the keys they have today, GUI's did not exist, monitors were terminals that displayed 80 x 25 characters and mice were nowhere to be found.<p>In the context of starting, launching, growing, evolving and maintaining a tech business spending any time to get into something like vim is an absolutely irresponsible waste of time and effort.",1362166976

Take MS DOS and MS Windows 95 as an example - IIRC Win95 still ran under DOS, yet it exposed completely new APIs and model of user interaction. Would you say that discussing Win95 means discussing DOS? Would you say that Win95 is the same as DOS?<p>As for modes - I didn't want to get into this - you seem to be convinced that having modes is a bad thing. Your argument is that ""every other editor is modeless"" - and it's false. The truth is that almost every modern, serious editor includes vi emulation mode and hence can work in a modal fashion - from Visual Studio to PyCharm to SublimeText all of them have an option to have modes. So your argument is simply wrong.<p>Is modal editing objectively worse thing? I don't believe so. I think that, while introducing some overhead for simple commands (one additional key press for changing modes) it significantly simplifies complex things, because you don't need modifiers and chaining commands is easier.<p>As for VIM being vi brought back to life - see Win95 argument above.",1362166743

In general, navigating to part of the list is O(n), but if your list is a doubly-linked circular linked-list, or alternately if you keep a pointer to the end as a special case, then ""navigate to the end of the list"" becomes also O(1).

From my limited experience, it seems that people sometimes spend a lot of time on concurrency when faster code would have been easier<p>It can reach FORTRAN speeds with the right tools.  With Numba (<a href=""http://numba.pydata.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://numba.pydata.org/</a>), your pure Python code gets compiled down to optimized machine code at call time, if your arguments are Numpy arrays.  With NumbaPro (<a href=""https://store.continuum.io/cshop/numbapro"" rel=""nofollow"">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/numbapro</a>), we automatically parallelize for multi-core CPUs, and we emit CUDA/PTX for GPUs, and automatically exploit the parallelism in your data and algorithm.<p>The reason ""higher level languages"" can be faster than lower-level ones is because the compiler has more information about data parallelism.  Typically ""low level languages"" are lower in that their type primitives are smaller, and hence the algorithms around those have turned vectorizable arrays into opaque for loops over arbitrary loop variables.<p>I certainly agree with you that many people now reach for distributed and parallel while leaving a lot of single-core and single-node performance on the table, mostly by ignoring the realities of memory bandwidth on modern CPUs.

My friend explained that he did not realize <i>it's not normal</i> for the aunt who's on meth to be the ""stable"" one in their family (dad is such a drunk he never eats or buys food Auntie Meth feeds the boy, somehow). Unfortunately, that poor kid is now fucked.<p>I also used to live in a part of Baltimore City in the midst of gentrification and shared my block with people who'd lived in the same house for generations and people on welfare.

Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into ""layers"", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.<p>I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS (and other platforms) to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.<p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)<p>See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!",1362166384

And the essay you wrote on this topic is equally interesting.<p>I get what you are saying, and you are right that what I am proposing is innately unscientific.  What I am trying to say is that the process of making new science often has to have these flaws, because ideas in the real world are rarely evaluated on their merits alone.  Ideas come from people who are fallible and have to fit their ideas into a social context.  What you hold to be the ideal:<p><pre><code>    Scientific findings must be able to rise above their origins and stand alone\n</code></pre>\nis the same as what I hold to be ideal, and I also mentioned it's what my dad admires about science.  But the reality is more complicated: when a fresh result comes out of a lab, people judge it by the affiliations of the authors, what journal it came from, and that person's prior ideas and assumptions, because replicating or depending on the truth of that result could be a costly mistake (millions of dollars, years of work).  The sparsity of biological research in particular means that there are sometimes only a few labs in the world that can readily run experiments with any relevance to a given topic, so until enough attention is given for it to be replicated, a single result and corresponding ""story"" pretty much stands solely on the reputation of the authors.<p>So while it is absolutely correct that a scientific principle should stand on its own, and those principles are the ones we learn in the college intro courses, until a hypothesis gathers enough supporting data to <i>become</i> a principle (let's say it is only a few years old), the <i>process</i> of science at the margins is inherently social.<p>I didn't even get into matters of ethics and politics.  For example, there are important medical principles today that were gathered through highly unethical (and regrettable) research in the early 20th century; if similar experiments were performed today, the experimenters would be vilified and the results discarded out of principle, even if it was robustly scientific with a significant impact.",1362166107

Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: \nJava. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: \nYou know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.<p>You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.

You can do a lot. You can recognize idioms, use different representations behind people's back, etc.<p>But all those things take time that is not spent running your program.  On average, you can do pretty well.  But it's still overhead.  As you get farther along in your JIT, optimization algorithms get trickier and trickier, your heuristics, more complex.\nYou will eventually hit the wall, and need to spend more time doing JIT'ing than doing real work to make optimizations to some code.\nThis happens to every single JIT, of course.\nThis is why they try to figure out which code to optimize.\nBut even then, you may find there is too much of it.<p>Because of this, the languages <i>are</i> slower, it's just the overhead of better JIT algorithms, not slower code.  In practice, you hope that you can optimize enough code well enough that nobody cares, because the ruby code takes 8ms, and the C code takes 5ms.<p>For example: Almost all of the allocations and copying can be optimized, but depending on the language, the algorithms to figure out what you can do safely may be N^3.<p>Also, PyPy is still pretty young in its life cycle (in this iteration of PyPy:P) for folks to say that they can make stuff much faster if they only had a few things.\nIt really needs a very large set of production apps being rin by a very large set of folks for quite a while to see where the real bottlenecks still are.\nPast a certain point, you run out of optimization algorithm bullets.  The way compilers get the last 20% is by tuning the algorithms for 10 years.<p>Of course, i'm not trying to slag on PyPy, I think they've done an amazing job of persevering through multiple rewrites to get somewhere that seems to be quite good now.  I just am a little wary of a fairly young JIT saying that all big performance problems fall into a few categories.",1362165426

I am in the process of starting two more.<p>In all cases these businesses started in my garage (one actually in my closet, before I had a garage) and managed to grow to the point where I got them out of the garage and actually hired many people.<p>Some of these businesses shipped product internationally, all over the world.<p>All of these businesses were hardware and software businesses.<p>Some succeeded and others failed.<p>And, in every single case, different technologies and tools came into the fold.<p>In no case whatsoever --not one-- across THIRTY YEARS of entrepreneurship did a fucking text editor have anything whatsoever to do with the success or failure of the enterprise or project.<p>Across a wide range of languages and technologies:  machine language (actually typed-in code with a hex keypad), assembler (various processors), Forth, C, APL, C++, Fortran, Visual Basic, Lisp, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Objective-C, Verilog, 8080, 8085, 80x86, PDP1104, 6502, MC68K, PowerPC, Xilinx FPGA's, PC, Mac, Linux, embedded, workstation and server software and a few other things I probably don't remember doing.<p>Not once.  Not ONE TIME.  Have I experienced a situation where using something like vim would provide any advantage whatsoever.<p>And, yes, I use vim on my Linux servers because it's there.  I don't have to think about it. It's the tool that comes with the box and I use it.  From there to actually CHOOSE to use vim everywhere for coding our projects and to go past that and evangelize vim?  That would be insane.  There far more moving parts and issues in a business or in any piece of software for a text editor to make any real difference whatsoever.  You can go on believing it does.  And that's fine.  That's not going to make it any real than believing in the tooth fairy.<p>Show me a real project and a real business that came in on-time, bug-free, profitably and ahead of schedule BECAUSE OF vim and I'll gladly eat my words.  Because I actually happen to know what I am talking about I can say with absolute confidence that the whole thing is a big smelly pile of bullshit.  If the authors had the tools, keyboards and peripherals we have today vim would have been completely and utterly different.

5306205,comment,5304873,5305026,4,0,simonster,,,"It's true that implementation makes a bigger difference to performance than language features, but language features can indeed affect speed. One clear example is that a language that checks for integer overflow will be slower than a language that doesn't. There are a lot of situations where there's no way you could optimize out the extra instructions you'd need to check for overflow.<p>Some language features are easy to optimize away for some common cases (e.g. array bounds checks, so that your program throws an exception instead of segfaulting), but you can't optimize these if, for example, you're iterating over data you read from a file using indices you also read from that file.",1362164558

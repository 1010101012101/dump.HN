5178428,comment,5177994,5178224,3,0,rjknight,,,"Some industries or professions are male-dominated because the industry itself has been around for a long time and thus has historically been male-dominated.  Weirdly, those industries are probably diversifying faster than IT because they were the first obvious targets for women wanting to ""break the glass ceiling"" - being the first female lawyer, professor or general in a particular firm/university/country is quite a prestigious achievement, and books and movies are made about those kinds of people (though actually this makes me realise that I'd love to read a book or watch a movie about a woman who does something cool as a software developer - and no, <i>Hackers</i> doesn't count).  It's easier to bring external political pressure on those industries partly because everyone regards them as important, and locking women out of 'important' industries was probably regarded as a major problem to solve for politicians.  Also, the first women to achieve something close to workplace equality with men were probably relatively high-status women to begin with, and they would have wanted to break into prestigious professions.<p>Programming and IT has not, until recently, been regarded as particularly high-status, and it was not regarded as a problem for society at large that most of the people doing it were men.  But now people regard software and IT as very important - people like Steve Jobs or Aaron Swartz or Mark Zuckerberg or Tim Berners-Lee have a similar order of influence in society as, say, senior judges, politicians or scientists.  It now seems unreasonable that, if ""code is law"" (in Larry Lessig's phrase), the law is being written mostly by men.<p>I guess those are the <i>political</i> reasons why people regard the gender balance in software as <i>'problematic'</i>.  There are other reasons too - greater gender diversity may lead to greater diversity of thought, and this is generally a good thing; women may bring different skills and attitudes which may be beneficial (though this is by no means guaranteed, and certainly doesn't mean that any given woman is going to do this); purely personally, I've worked well with women in project management, business analysis and other roles and I'd like to see similarly talented women doing programming too.<p>The question of why Etsy are doing what they're doing is intriguing though.  If one believes that sexism is rife, and that self-interest of the firm concerned argues against spending money training female developers who aren't necessarily even going to work for you, then it is almost impossible to explain the behaviour described in the OP.  One of the assumptions must be wrong, I guess.",1360180596

5178400,comment,5176140,5178287,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"It's hard. Startups begin in a state of constrained open allocation. It's not ""work on whatever you want"" because the company needs laser focus, but it's also not big enough for managerial extortion/closed allocation to set in, because the nominal social distance between any two people is still 1 edge. Small startups can have problems, but the loss-of-culture usually happens when companies get larger.<p>Around 15 people, that one-edge factor becomes less true and if you don't explicitly manage the culture, you'll start having political problems. People won't turn malevolent right away, but your process becomes biased in favor of losing good people and attracting bad ones, especially as the TechCrunch coverage mounts and you become attractive to narcissists who want to be your next generation of transplant executives. You have to be an exceptional judge of character to avoid hiring bad executives (remember: many of these people lie and schmooze for a living) and judgment-of-character does not scale.<p>Most companies lose startup culture rapidly (like, before they get to 50) in the process of hiring executives, because traditional dinosaur managers assess their self-worth based on metrics like ""number of reports"" and want to be handed control of other people. Also, once you have a world in which engineers are getting 0.08% and VPs get 0.5%, the ""Uncle Tom Engineer"" effect sets in and you lose your engineer-centric culture.<p>Valve did a couple things differently. First of all, my understanding is that they use profit sharing instead of equity. There are advantages and drawbacks of that model, but at the sub-0.5% order or magnitude, ""ownership"" is meaningless and a more generous profit-sharing system is going to be a lot better for most employees than a meager equity/stock-option system. Second, they made open allocation a cultural pillar that no would-be executive can challenge.<p>Valve trusts before it hires, and that's different from these get-big-or-die VC-istan companies that hire people in bulk but don't implicitly trust most of them with their own time.",1360180261

My post was not even about how the system is biased against men, it was about how bias against men also exists.<p>It is extremely difficult to achieve a perfect balance of a 50/50 gender split in the industry. There isn't a 50/50 ratio in Computer Science/Engineering to begin with. If a company or manager tries to bring the ratio to 50/50 (like in my post), you are bound to hire people who are not a good fit simply because you eliminated a portion of the pool for no valid reason. Of course bad hires occur all the time, but trying to force a 50/50 split or a female majority when the supply is not there will only increase that chance.<p>Sexism against females in the industry is nothing to be laughed at.

But because energy drinks are sweet and easily drinkable, novice caffeine users can hit their upper limit in a short amount of time.<p>And because the half-life of caffeine ranges from 5 hours to 15 hours (!) you can get a strong excess build up in your body in a quick amount of time.

The bulk of the heavy lifting that keeps it going is paid labor.<p>In the mid-to-late 1990s, work on Perl was funded by revenue from books, employers, and conferences.   Apache by financial donations to an NPO.<p>In the 1990s, the ""community value"" of helping others by offering free support in on-line forums was promoted by industry as a way to gain reputation enough to get a job.  It was promoted by some investors as a way for commercial efforts to gain users and obtain free labor without paying the full cost of support.<p>Clay claims that it was ""something new"" when Linus could post about the kernel in its earliest days and get a ""global network of collaborators"".   That's a remarkable claim that ignores not only the entirety of the GNU project effort that preceded it but decades of (quite often commercially motivated) software sharing the preceded that.<p>Clay has confused a difference in the modality of economic collaboration that becomes possible when source code is shared, with ""love"".<p>On the topic of motivation he is also too glib.  He asserts that Linus' collaborators asked for nothing other than the chance to come together and do something interesting.  That it was suddenly possible to do big things for love.<p>He ignores that it took all of 23 months before the founding of VA Research (as evidence that commercial interest was already, by then, a major factor).<p>This kind of talk bothers me because it takes what I think of as a high value (love) and misrepresents it and misrepresents history.

The reasoning was that females are more creative and in general, more social. This idea of ""females > males"" was expressed multiple times over my time here, and it has really begun to take off. In our last round of hiring a co-op, our team lead said ""the new co-op has to be a girl"". In the screening phase, the team lead decided we would not interview a few of the male applicants, for no specific reason. We then picked 2 people (1 male, 1 female) for interviews. The female candidate was interviewed by myself, a co-worker, and the team lead. This candidate was not exceptional in any way and was not more skilled than the other candidate. She was hired the second the interview ended.<p>A year prior, we had a female co-op student who was on a 8 month term. 3 months into the term, she was given an offer by the manager for a full-time position. This offer was in secret, and other teams were not to hear about it until her last month. As she was still in school, she expressed that she wanted the job but wanted to finish her last year and graduate. And so the position (and budget), was saved for her for the year, regardless of whether or not she was able to graduate.<p>I have no problem against hiring female engineers. However, hiring female candidates over male candidates simply because of gender is discrimination, and that's not something I agree with. This kind of discrimination can also be detrimental to the success of the team/company.<p>Simple example: Let's assume 10 of 30 (about 33%) applicants are female. The team decides to select 10 people for interviews (yes there are places that do not interview based on fit alone but fit + headcount). Since there are only 10 females, if we only select females, there are a few problems. 1) We lose out on any male candidates that may be a better fit (which also comes from a pool of 20/30). 2) We're forced to spend money and resources on candidates that essentially have a 0% chance of being hired because they would not have passed the screening if sexism were not in play.",1360179355

To some extent, there's a hint of academy politics as well: people who publish, get cited, etc., move more quickly than people who don't. To another extent, there's classic politics: people who schmooze within the Beltway, know how to play the media game, etc., get ahead quicker than others.<p>In many respects, David Petraeus is the perfect embodiment of these political principles. He published, he politicked, he maximized his media exposure, and he hobnobbed within the right DC circles. I'm not qualified to judge whether or not he was as good a leader as many believe him to have been. But he was certainly a top-notch political operative.<p>(Other government agencies, e.g., the CIA, have very similar internal political incentives. The game is almost the same.

Those points could just as easily say 'people' instead of 'women', and as near as I can tell be just as true.  I'm quite willing to believe that ""People"" tend to be conservative about switching jobs, especially if they've had a negative experience in the past.  And I can see tech interviews set up ""people"" for failure; but I don't see anything specific to women in that, unless you want to start from some really negative stereotypes.  Working on those issues will probably help your offer acceptance rate, regardless of gender - but you need to be sure you can still distinguish good candidates from bad candidates, so you can't just toss them entirely.<p>So that leads us to the contrast between point #3, don't lower hiring standards, and the conclusion - a method of trying to get better results from reduced experience requirements when hiring.  Getting good results from less experience is definitely something important and useful, but less experience -is- a lower standard, so I think the most interesting topic is there.  Is watching people in hacker school really enough of an equalizer compared to years of experience?  How does it compare to running an intern or co-op program?  Is there any problem with the sponsored hackers getting trained on Etsy's dime but working for a competitor?  How is hacker school different/better than working with a local university?",1360177743

I have a business degree & work in business development. I can also hack enough to contribute to the product I work on at a valley giant.<p>I taught myself to code over the last few years b/c I was tired of the attitude I got from hackers when I talked about concepts & ideas. Now I only appreciate what hackers do more.<p>There are two premises that motivated me to write this post:<p>1) I believe that both suits and hackers under-appreciate each other. The lack of symbiosis is the reason most start-ups & projects go nowhere and/or fail.<p>2) Hackers pigeon-hole business folks just like suits do hackers. Suites think that any ol' hacker can just 'write some code' and build their product; hackers think any suit can 'do some marketing or sell the product.'<p>Neither is true.<p>What I'd like to demonstrate to hackers is that some suits (like some hackers) have 'it.' Call it intuition, business savvy, a sixth sense, whatever. It's the ability to determine whether an app, website, concepts, etc. has market value or potential.<p>So the idea came up to use HN to ask people to share what they're working on and then have me - the suit - give VC-style, pinpoint feedback to show why/how whatever project does/does not work in the market<p>Our goal here is to a) prove the importance of some suits - those with 'it' - to the conceptualization & execution of a project, and b) dispel the theory that any hacker can just 'create something and turn it into a business.'<p>But, the larger aim is to prove that if we want to move ourselves forward, we're going to have to develop a much healthier respect and appreciation for each other - hackers and suits.<p>So, if you're up for it and have a relevant, project post your MVP, app, site, whatever and I will break it down.",1360177385

I have yet to do the research, but my gut tells me that empirical evidence would surely prove that my organizational and note-taking methods are universally and uniformly the best for all human beings living on this planet.  As such, I judge my subordinates not on their performance or their contributions to the team, but rather by their ability to recognize the unquestionable brilliance of All The Things That I Do.  While I stand here waiting for you to fetch your laptop (by the way, next week we are switching to iPads - NO MINIS!), I will post an insightful essay to my extremely valuable blog explaining my frustration with people who mistakenly believe that any human being anywhere would not be better off if he just tried harder to emulate me.<p>You may now commence agreeing with me,<p>Your Team Manager",1360177368
5178142,comment,5176140,5177874,7,0,InclinedPlane,,,"<i>sigh</i> Let's call off the angry accusation slinging straw man slap fight and just pencil in on the official forms that we did it, shall we?<p>I haven't said, nor do I mean to imply, that my dad is better than your dad, err, I mean, that software development is somehow on a higher plane or superior to other work. However, there is something that sets software apart from most other work in that it is almost entirely design work, even ""construction"" is design work. (Of course, there is often something that sets most genres of work apart from other genres too, every industry has its unique aspects.) A particular engineering task might require more man-hours in design than in construction but that is an edge case, and the ratio is unlikely to be higher than an order of magnitude, the norms still apply. And again, software sees a rather larger range of scale than almost any other industry. The difference in, say, the amount of data handled by a given piece of software can range from a single byte (or even a single bit) up to petabytes or higher (the LHC processes zettabytes of data per year). That's 21 orders of magnitude. The difference between the smallest features in a microchip and the longest superhighways on Earth is only 15 magnitudes, and those are considered to be hugely different industries.<p>The main point I wanted to get at though was that due to the primacy of design individual talent can often have an outsized impact on overall product quality or capability. You certainly see that in many other disciplines but not necessarily on the same scale. Because, again, it's not terribly rare to have a situation where a piece of software developed by a single developer is just generally better than one developed by a team working at a multi-billion dollar mega-corp. That's the equivalent of some guy building a Mach 10 plane in his garage that runs on solar power. You tend not to see extremes on such magnitudes outside of software.<p>Indeed, it's even a driving force in the industry, as the idea of being able to build some new or better product from nothing and scale up to a billion dollar company in a matter of years starting from only one or two founders is rather common in software and shockingly uncommon outside of it.",1360177365

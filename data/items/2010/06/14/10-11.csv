I was really astonished as to how sophisticated the spam economy is. Previously I thought spamming was just someone opening a free account and sending dozens of hundreds of emails for a affiliate account of his/her.(Ah... the ignorant days!). But they use high tech solutions to get through spam filters and covert channels for payment. It requires skilful use of a lot of things just to send email. At first I was just curious of how these things work. But by the end of the book as was astonished by how creative these people can be in there use of tools.<p>The OP is right in presuming that this creative entrepreneurial energy can be channelled to make greater things in the favour of man kind. (That will also reduce the internet traffic and free the precious limited bandwidth).",1276512661

If Aspartame causes cancer it should be significantly visible in the subject animals.

I can still get a lot done here and communicate with others online... but I guess that's only good for so long. Face to face is so much better.<p>2) I guess, if I'm honest, fear of not being good enough. I make good money here but worry that I wouldn't if I went somewhere else where there are much more talented developers. Maybe it's justified, maybe it's not.

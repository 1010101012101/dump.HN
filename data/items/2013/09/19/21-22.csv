Simple, clear, anyone can read it. What&#x27;s wrong? One of the following:<p>* It&#x27;s based on timing and unreliable<p>* It stores state and the steps can&#x27;t be reused.<p>You simply cannot put the line &quot;Then the edit version of the credentials should not change&quot; elsewhere because the step involves <i>the previous state of the system</i>. This step can <i>only</i> come after this step:<p><pre><code>    Given a credential for a supported vendor\n</code></pre>\nThese tests all look like they&#x27;re testing really nice general properties, but they aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re almost always just checking little properties here and there, and rarely doing just what the step says. Which could be fine, but the language doesn&#x27;t support any idea of specified dependencies. I cannot change a test without understanding the code behind it.<p>What you end up with is a big codebase based on regexes, with very heavy (non-specified) dependencies. You have to be extremely careful not to end up like this, although the tests look more complex afterwards (but you have re-usable steps).<p>I think there&#x27;s a great place for a quickcheck & cucumber combination.",1379627996

It&#x27;s also entirely possible that potential sources of funding are waiting for other games that focus on swordplay to release[0]. In addition, their team is a bit light on game veterans. The co-founders are both authors who don&#x27;t appear to have business experience, much less game development experience. Their VP of game development is an industry veteran, but one who has mostly done art development.

Colleges are long-term institutions and can (and should) make architectural investments that are long-term rather than short-term. A cheap throwaway is exactly the opposite of what colleges should do, although there are plenty of situations where cheap throwaway housing is appropriate, where short-term economics outweigh long-term economics in the buyer&#x27;s eyes.<p>This line of thought brought to you by the superb book, <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, by Stewart Brand.

There&#x27;s nothing stopping from other companies from coming up with something similar; the problem for now is adoption.<p>I&#x27;d like to find a document editor outside of the major competitors like Microsoft and Google, but to be honest, the others are frankly terrible by comparison. When that changes, at least in the document area, Google is going to rethink what they&#x27;re doing or buy them out (which is also possible).<p>The one thing that ties all of these services together for now is Gmail. Because it serves as a single login, it makes transition to other Google owned products easier. Besides being good at the services they provide, this is the real grease in the wheels that makes the whole machine run.<p>We&#x27;re already seeing other services crop up to fill the niche YouTube is filling. Vimeo, for example, is actually quite good. While it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the silly videos and stupid clips YouTube is famous for, it&#x27;s got a lot of creative people making beautiful content.

6414548,comment,6414403,6414403,2,0,argonaut,,,"> many angels wont invest in startups that arent likely to scale to the $50 million valuation level because theyre afraid VCs wont invest.<p>Firstly, I don&#x27;t think this is true. Angels won&#x27;t invest because their business model is the same as the VC&#x27;s model.<p>I&#x27;ll be blunt and say that I think this is a pretty bad idea for both sides of the table: founders and angels/investors. In fact, this would be an even worse deal for bootstrapped companies than it would be for non-bootstrapped companies. This is bad for founders because it impacts revenue. A normal SV startup has no revenue, so it&#x27;s not too impactful there, but for a bootstrapped company, having to give 0.X% revenue can be really hurtful. Less revenue = less growth and more likely to run out of cash. The vast majority of founders would probably <i>prefer</i> giving equity than doing a rev. share.<p>Secondly, this idea depends on the assumption that bootstrapped companies are inherently much, much less risky than typical go-big startups, which is the only way in which I can see the risk ratio justifying the much smaller potential returns of having a rev share of a slow-growth company. I do not think this is the case.The whole reason for the go-big VC ecosystem is because startups - <i>any</i> startups - are extremely risky, and you therefore need an extremely high potential reward (i.e 50-200x return) to justify investing in them. Bootstrapped companies are not sufficiently less risky (in fact, I would argue they are <i>more</i> risky than VC backed companies).<p>Another problem: would you cap the rev payout or would the payout continue in perpetuity? Investors wouldn&#x27;t like the former because it caps their reward, founder wouldn&#x27;t like the latter because it&#x27;s an obligation that lasts for a very long time.<p>Finally, given that most startups exit as acquisitions, what then? Again, an entire avenue for rewarding investors is cut off.",1379627544

The point I was trying to make with the cake metaphor is simply that the price of x is not determined by the cost of the inputs, but by the value of the output.<p>The part of your comment that I don&#x27;t understand is the bit about the government support. I don&#x27;t really see how that relates to the cake metaphor. Am I missing something?<p>Also, you&#x27;re describing a situation that can logically only arise in the context of market failure (this is interesting because I alluded to this in my first comment).<p>If people aren&#x27;t willing to pay the higher cost of the cake because the benefit doesn&#x27;t justify the cost, why would it make sense for the government to use tax money to intervene?<p>Short answer: it doesn&#x27;t.<p>This only makes sense if the total benefit of cake > the cost of the cake, but there was some market inefficiency in the way.<p>You could certainly argue that this is the case with scientific research. In fact I personally would agree with this argument.

6414455,comment,6407197,6413204,1,0,cehlen,,,"Yes, you are correct that is how it works.  Im still in development and have about three major bugs I still need to work out, plan on doing that this weekend.  And performance is bit slow due to I have not minified the JavaScript yet, also a weekend project.  The goal of I Am Near is to associate content and services to specific geographic locations.  Currently content and services can take the form of full blown applications, embeddable widgets, or SOAP/RESTful web services.  The basic premise is that a users experience should change depending on where they are.  For example if a user goes to <a href=""http://www.mcdonalds.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcdonalds.com</a> in their home they would be presented with general information about McDonalds and listings of the closest locations.  If a user is in the same shopping mall at lunch time they would be presented with specials and deals to help entice them to go to the McDonalds 50 yards away.  If they are in an actual McDonalds they would have the ability to order their lunch and even pay for it using their smart phone/mobile device.  The HTML5 geolocation API gives you the latitude and longitude but often that is meaningless.  As a developer I would much rather be given information such as user is in Old Town Scottsdale or user is in Store #2345 than user is at 33.26552, -111.89116.  Fundamentally that is the problem I Am Near is trying to solve.  If you get chance please play with it. Right now its just me so any additional developer input is greatly appreciated.",1379626197

Last time I measured, it was about ~100mA vs ~1mA (at ~3.7V) used by the radio.  So, it&#x27;s not couple of minutes of battery life, but rather _many_ hours of standby life instead.  People usually aren&#x27;t very happy when a fully charged phone dies overnight.<p>I&#x27;ve seen apps do some crazy things and it really has a significant effect in over-all battery life.

Sure, some of it is &quot;process&quot;, but not &quot;process and people&quot; (to me, though the people are good too).<p>-- Academic science definitely has a profit motive: get money to do more science.<p>-- Academic &quot;workhorses&quot; get paid $40k because they&#x27;re either in training (grad student) or in a holding pattern (postdocs) and looking for the &quot;right&quot; long-term gig.<p>-- Biological sciences have perverse career trajectories compared to others in STEM.  I still can&#x27;t believe that you need multiple 5-year postdocs to be (truly) eligible for faculty jobs.  Probably some supply-demand things going on there.<p>-- My gut tells me... People in science who bitch about others&#x27; motivations are just projecting their own unhappiness.  You can love science and its beauty without committing your life to it.",1379624752

However, after they added copy and paste I really began to appreciate the simplicity, stability, and functionality.<p>I resonated with this article quite a bit. For SEO work and regular tasks I still prefer a Thinkpad with a Trackpoint and a great keyboard (X201 is my current weapon of choice) (My dad was a Sys Admin at a computer Recycling company and so I had quite a share of various laptops from major computer companies in Silicon Valley.) However for video/audio I have a maxed out Macbook Pro i7 (pre-Retina), iPad 3, and still use iPhone 4S, had iPhone 5 and sold it.<p>So here is the thing I have iPhone 4s, iPad 3, and Macbook Pro (pre-Retina) with no desire to upgrade at all.<p>iPhone 4S vs 5, the screen on iPhone 5 is too big. 4S feels perfect in my hand.<p>I agree with Steve why would I want a smaller iPad 4, if I have iPad 3 that is bigger size having retina?<p>Macbook Pro (pre-Retina) is the last laptop that can be have its memory and battery changed without having to take it to Apple Store having to do that is a hassle.<p>Now iOS 7, its throwing away all-things-apple-design and now following Android? The main reason I advocated Apple products was simplicity in its like real life skeuomorphic design (more here: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/11/scott_forstall_fired_skeumorphism_the_design_concept_that_s_tearing_apple.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/11/...</a>) I love that. You have seen the latest TechCrunch article on other App companies following suit and redesigning, with Hipmunk being a good example of over-simplistic Android feel that is not very user friendly.<p>All that background to say, I was hoping Steve Jobs would instill a culture/legacy after him to continue with the same thinking and mindset about the design. Yet, now I see how much of what Apple is was tied to Steve Jobs. Its a little scary: to have Apple changed after Steve Jobs, and sad, thinking about what Apple will become in a few years.

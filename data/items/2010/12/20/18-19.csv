We skipped the process that Jason talks about, built something, and then tried to market it in various trial-and-error ways. Surely we could find <i>someone</i> who would want it at a price that would make us happy?<p>We tried different media, different target markets, biz dev, etc. Only to find out that the idea was just a stinker. That takes a whole lot more time, money <i>and emotional investment that can be hard to walk away from</i> than <i>really</i> digging into some potential customers before you start coding.<p>It's much, much easier to scrap a crappy idea before you've built it. It's almost impossible to scrap a good idea once it's been validated.<p>I would say that among the people I know who have been very successful starting companies, a very healthy majority sold the product before building it, intentionally or otherwise.

I realise the odds are pretty much against me on every front. The two biggest obstacles I see are heavy SEO keyword competition and, well, zero user base to start with. Adding insult, this isn't my field so I've got no networks to lean on for support.<p>Despite all that, I feel strongly about the idea. If I don't pull it off now, I'm convinced that someone else eventually will: I'm convinced this is the right direction for the people-matching problem.<p>If anyone's interested, I'll be blogging very openly about the whole startup (link on homepage). In particular, I'll be publishing detailed analytics as I go along.<p>Would seriously love any kind of feedback from HN: especially if anyone has any particular ideas or suggestions to help get me going on the growth/marketing front.

I frequently read good articles and then forget to vote them up because something else catches my attention.

Just the opposite: some hacker types get worked up because they seem to be allergic to promotion of any kind, and thus won't upvote the article, even though they would have otherwise. But I'm betting that the balance of people who upvote because they liked the article AND because they were reminded outweighs the anti-promotion crowd. Either way, I don't think it's a big deal.

This is exactly what I did, and it was exactly a year ago that I quit my well paying day job to jump in with both feet.  Our start was similar to yours too, we had an idea that got some funding from an incubator. We had some prototype and our idea wasn’t really proven at all.  I found HN, read Founders at Work and every one of PG’s essays too.  I felt exactly what you’re feeling now.  Ride that high as long as you possibly can.  You’re going to have an amazing journey no matter where this experience takes you in the end, and I can promise that you won’t regret anything.<p>With that said, please think about if this is really the right time to make the jump.  As you know, an idea is worthless, it’s about execution.  Testing can take forever to find the right direction to go in.  When I was making the jump I always told myself that we’d figure something out before our runway ran short. We had so much time to do it, how could we not?  Well, we ran out of time and could never find that key feature to make us profitable.  I did a million things completely wrong and so will you, but you don’t need to quit your job to make those mistakes and learn from them.  I always try to encourage people who want to make a similar jump to make the really dumb mistakes when you can pay your bills with a 9-5, not when those mistakes can cause you not to eat for a night.  I personally think it’s a bad idea for anyone to quit a job just to waste time building and testing an idea.  I feel it’s best to make the jump when you find something that’s working and use all the new free time you get from quitting the 9-5 to sell/test/improve that.  When you find that revenue driving feature or idea you can easily improve on what you have, but If you have nothing you can be stuck trying to find it forever.<p>I wish you the best of luck, and I'm looking forward to reading more updates as the company grows.  Your team sounds like it has a lot more experience going in than mine did, so I'm sure you will figure something out soon.<p>If you're interested where I am now, I’m actually writing this from my desk at the same 9-5 I quit a year ago.  That’s right, I’m back working at the same place I left (I guess they liked :) ).   I don’t regret a thing, but in hindsight I do wish I waited until the vision I was going on was a little more clear and mature.  I'm 100% sure I'm going to give it another shot in the future, and I'll get a lot further than I did this time thanks to everything I've learned.",1292870528

2025277,comment,2024252,2024252,0,0,jdietrich,,,"All farming essentially boils down to the conversion of energy into a form which people can eat. Grass turns sunlight into carbohydrate. Cows turn grass into meat. The bottom of the chain is sunlight, the top is us, farming sits in the middle. Our choices in farming are essentially one of how efficiently we can convert solar energy into food calories. Modern farming and food production is heavily reliant on oil to fuel tractors and make synthetic fertiliser, but the primary energy input is still sunlight.<p>Going vertical just spreads the same amount of light over a broader area. Your yield only increases if you use electric lighting, which is only economically viable if electricity gets very, very cheap. Using vertical sheds to farm cattle doesn't help, because the land use to house cattle is negligible compared to the land needed to grow their feed. Vertical farming doesn't help reduce soil depletion, because it depends on what we use now to amend poor soil - oil-based fertilisers. Vertical farming is a perfectly reasonable solution if we solve cold fusion, but there are a whole lot of other problems that magically disappear if we discover a limitless source of practically free energy.<p>Food is just a proxy for energy and any future food crisis is likewise a proxy for an energy crisis. Much as it'd be easy if we could solve it all, we can't. We've been living on millennia of stored energy and that store is coming to an end. We cannot escape the fact that we will have to dramatically reduce our energy use. Easy solutions to the problem of energy are tremendously appealing, but the laws of physics are a harsh mistress. The future of our species rests entirely upon joules, watts and kilocalories. Vertical farming is an appealing but irrational fantasy, rooted of the same fallacies as food pills and jetpacks.",1292870512

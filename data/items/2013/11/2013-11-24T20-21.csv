I guess they did not implement it because they don&#x27;t want to put complex features like this, and that&#x27;s understandable. But sometimes an economy can work much better when detailed information is available about what&#x27;s around your home, which is not the case today. Companies do use advertisement, but single individuals don&#x27;t and companies don&#x27;t wait for people to search for their product, and I&#x27;m sure there are ways to advertise yourself if you skip the dating stuff, and let everyone post their interests so it can searched and found by people around you. Advertisement only gives voice to people who can afford it because there are too few room for it.<p>The real problem here is the number of participants (you need a big sample if you want users to find matches) and how it cannot be datamined.<p>I think it would work if it was anonymised and if it would encourage private talks.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why google did not try that, they know how to effectively sort data by topic and category.",1385326722

Some gene&#x27;s turn on and off. Attributes like your face and fingerprints change over time.

Or in english, an entire record of their genetics from start to end:<p><pre><code>    struct LIFETIME_UUID {\n        void * uuid;\n        void * pit_uuid_TIMESTAMP1; \n        void * pit_uuid_TIMESTAMP2; \n        void * pit_uuid_TIMESTAMP3;\n        ...\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThat should eliminate conflicts in edge cases like identical twins or cloning.",1385325600

For now I&#x27;ll just point out that many young creators in video are falling into the youtube sphere of influence.<p>A lot of independent video producers have switched from using their own proprietary video distribution systems to merely hosting their videos on youtube. The monetization difficulties are made up by the ease of distribution, network effect, and lower costs.<p>Also, there are a fair number of kickstarter projects where the end result is the creation of videos on youtube (such as Tropes vs Women). Within the Film & Video category on kickstarter many projects in all sub-categories will release their content on youtube and the webseries sub-category is almost entirely youtube projects. If youtube had better monetization models and improved ability to host paid and unpaid content almost all of those projects would host on youtube.<p>Consider the many musical acts that have risen to fame through exposure or maturation through youtube. Walk off the Earth, Julia Nunes, Pentatonix, and of course Justin Beiber being just a few examples among many.<p>Consider that Bon Jovi&#x27;s song &quot;Living on a Prayer&quot; recently made its way back to #25 on Billboard&#x27;s charts (27 years after release) almost entirely due to the popularity of a viral video on youtube of a fan at a Celtic&#x27;s game dancing enthusiastically to the song.<p>(Edit: also look at the importance of youtube in the most widely heard pop music such as Psy&#x27;s Gangnam Style, LMFAO&#x27;s Party Rock Anthem, Lady Gaga&#x27;s Bad Romance, Gotye&#x27;s Somebody That I Used To Know, etc. It&#x27;s clear that youtube is as culturally relevant as MTV ever was, and that&#x27;s just a tiny fraction of youtube&#x27;s influence on the world.)<p>Or consider the veritable ecosystem of new funding platforms springing up to help creators using youtube to monetize and support their work (such as subbable.com, tested.com). Google&#x27;s idea along these lines is to introduce pay walls, whereas almost every creator prefers to use more of a pledge drive / premium level model.<p>Google has tackled the technical bits of web video quite well. They built a system that handles video uploads at greater than 6,000x real-time (over 6,000 seconds of video are uploaded to youtube every second).<p>Youtube alone is responsible for nearly 1/5th of all internet traffic.<p>Stop and read that again, it&#x27;s important. 1/5th of the usage of the entire internet is being dedicated to the use of youtube. And that figure is growing by double digit percentages year over year.<p>Unquestionably people are increasingly spending their video viewing hours watching content on youtube. And creators are increasingly turning to youtube as their distribution platform.<p>So yes, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s fair to say that there&#x27;s a very strong case that youtube is the future of video. And yet google still treats it as a hindrance, as a second class citizen. As mentioned above creators are desperate for tools to help them support and monetize their video making but they have to turn to 3rd party services to do so. Google has the expertise and capability to offer creators everything they need in a one stop shop. They also have the ability to invest in and support video makers to plant a seed of content creators on their site. And they did, but half-heartedly and without sufficient follow through. It&#x27;s going to take years until more than a handful of people can support themselves through youtube and even longer before we can see the sort of content that a &quot;youtube generation&quot; of artists is capable of creating. In the meantime such creators have to contend with google making arbitrary changes to youtube for their own petty reasons with little thought for the true potential of what they control.",1385324515

I am not making this up.<p>As you well know, back in the day when CGI was magic and server-side includes were amazing, there weren&#x27;t a lot of options for server side programming. You had C, if you were a Unixy systems programmer and didn&#x27;t mind doing string processing in C. You had Tcl, if you wanted to go the AOLserver route. You had whatever shell script you wanted, if you wanted to pipe and stream together Unixy commands. After a time, you even had server-side JavaScript, if you spent a lot of money on Netscape server products.<p>You also had Perl, which ran on just about every Unix under the sun and behaved the same way pretty much everywhere. Even if you couldn&#x27;t rely on one Unix utility behaving the same on every Unix variant (unless you somehow managed to get the GNU tools installed), you could rely on Perl being just about everywhere. Better yet, it had a fair library of code being developed and published because people were sharing it.<p>In the early days, you might have to use a Perl fork to connect to an Oracle or a Sybase installation, but you even had that option. (Yeah, you could do that in C too, but that would be borrowing pain far beyond string handling in C.)<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to see why Perl ended up with a lot of that market. It fit that niche which hadn&#x27;t previously existed, and there wasn&#x27;t much competition. (Korn shell. Korn. Shell.)<p>The market expanded rapidly. Then the competition expanded rapidly because the market expanded rapidly. It&#x27;s innumerate to suggest that the relative position of market share will remain the same or even grow when the market grows so rapidly and so much competition appears.",1385323230

Then you can talk to them a year later, if they're candid they'll tell you how things went. It's interesting seeing my friends who bought trying to time the market largely got wrecked - one friend lost a lot trying to catch the falling knife of Indymac and Washington Mutual. Another friend who lives in Amsterdam is a more fundamental investor, looks at the numbers and the markets. He invested in Marvel before it got bought by Disney and Baidu after the crash, and made a lot since then.<p>Long story short, it's a good brain exercise no matter what, it's a topic that matters to a lot of people, it's fun, it's very flexible, and so on.",1276246658

Again, on the output side that would mean being able to display two points at that separation with something contrasting in between.<p>On the other hand, elsewhere Wikipedia says that it means being able to distinguish Snellen optotypes whose total size is one arc-minute. On the face of it, that implies more resolution than two pixels per arc-minute. (Hand-wavily, maybe it's about the same: if you can resolve 2x2 pixels in a square of side 1 arcminute, then for high-contrast Snellen-type images that maybe suggests that you ought to be able to distinguish about 2^(2x2) = 16 different such images, and a Snellen chart actually uses 10 or 12 different optotypes, depending on whether it's one of Snellen's original ones or a modern variant. That's pretty close to 16.)<p>Phil Plait's blog entry that someone else linked to talks about the difference between ""normal"" and ""ideal"", and concludes that an average person looking at a new iPhone at 1' distance will indeed not be able to resolve the pixels (though not by much).",1276246380

There you can see that three primaries cover a large range of human colour perception.

1423244,comment,1421698,1423181,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Thanks. Though I think, in fairness, not too many people are arguing that any one event actually won the war.<p>The problem, I think, is that it is very easy to look back and see how things ""should"" have gone differently. Hindsight is a bitch :) I know a few people who have started a sentence with the words ""If I were Hitler I would have..."", and you have to turn round and say yes. Any sane man in Hitlers shoes could have won the war. But Hitler was in Hitlers shoes, and he didn't.<p>And then there are those who are often forgotten when discussing of the war. For example what about the Australian contribution; the Japanese are known for being resilient, refusing to give ground under any circumstances. But the Aussies had the same attitude and theirs was one of the most successful armies in the war (even in all time I think). They harried the Japanese on a number of flanks, that arguably kept them at bay where otherwise they may have won (or prolonged even further) the Pacific war.<p>Then there is the more complex matter of things which would have lost the war. This usually ranges from the sublime to the ridiculous; with all sorts of theories. But often ignores simple things like, the U Boats could have got lucky and hit 3 or 4 convoys in  a row. Logistically that could have won Germany the war as easily as anything else. It's simply impossible to predict.<p>A lot of Brits will argue that us holding out for those crucial few months was what won the war; I'm not entirely sure I disagree, it was certainly an extremely important thing. But so many people forget the country was full of US, French and other soldiers at the time; it was multi-national resilience. And, at the same time, the supply convoys kept us going, again a multi-national force.<p>At the end of the day my History teacher at school summed it up best:<p><i>You will meet all sorts of people who claim they won the war. But the truth is people won the war; lots of people from different nations pulling together in the same direction for once. It's a thing to be proud of.

Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute. The media exaggerate their numbers and importance. The media rarely mention the fact that the great majority of religious people belong to moderate denominations that treat science with respect, or the fact that the great majority of scientists treat religion with respect so long as religion does not claim jurisdiction over scientific questions.""",1276243839

The article makes it sound like he believed it likely that this exploit is already in the wild, but didn't want to say that directly when he said:  ""I've concluded that there’s a significant possibility that attackers have studied this component, and releasing this information rapidly is in the best interest of security""<p>And an active exploit in the wild seems like the kind of thing that would tip the scales.  Or maybe he believed that they'd sit on this for 6 months while all the black hats quietly formulated and circulated an exploit.",1276243556

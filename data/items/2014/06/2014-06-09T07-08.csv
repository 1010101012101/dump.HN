Can you imagine how big emscripten output would be?<p>I have been arguing that dart2js could have been using hand-written JIT compiler on the client side, but the startup performance compared to AOT would really be a big deal. I think a combination of AOT and JIT would be the best, but sadly it is also true that JavaScript lacks right level of abstraction.

If any of you have developed with the Kinect, (i spent a year on it 2 years ago) it is pretty impressive for a not too expensive piece of hardware.<p>I think MSFT is doing it right by really working on it, as we all are aware they have had their share of flops.<p>Putting out a great product specially like kinect is pretty exciting. Oculus is cool but its FB buyout puts it in a strange place and it was years out anyway from general adoption. The kinect is much simpler and cheaper and has already been out on the market which, gives it some validation. Plus, I am not sure how many people will go through the trouble of putting on goggles in wide range adoption. That being said I think simpler devices like the kinect have more mass market appeal, and thus the adoption of devices like kinect will ultimately be instrumental in the success of more complex interfaces like Oculus, etc...",1402300511

I am not defending the status quo but just pointing out that people who argue for abolishing the whole system needs to first understand its historical role before taking a drastic action.<p>At the risk of over-simplifying, there is a tussle between &#x27;software as a collection of algorithms which in turn are defined as a special class of mathematics&#x27; which is not patentable, vs software as a &#x27;product&#x27; that provides useful functions which is in-line with how patents have been applied in other areas. Things get a little more complicated with &#x27;process patents&#x27; as applied to software.<p>It is hard to draw a fine line here and I don&#x27;t claim to have any answers except looking at each case individually and deciding to apply it, sort of like the early definition of art vs porn: &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; (or something to that effect).<p>Even if you were to grant a expansive protection for functional cases or business methods (implemented by the software), you will still have ridiculous ones like the &#x27;Amazon one-click patent&#x27;.<p>Regarding examples of &#x27;success stories&#x27;, I am not sure if these apply but the entire model of software business was driven on licenses during its critical growth period in the 1980s.

Wifi clients usually only save the name and security type/PSK of previously joined networks. In many situations, the same SSID is broadcast by multiple different APs with different MAC addresses in the same area so it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to remember a specific SSID/MAC pair.<p>If the same client (iPhone) probes for a list of SSIDs with one random MAC and then probes for the same list again a short while later with a different randomised MAC, you could still track that individual based on the list of networks they probe for.<p>If the client MAC is randomised for every single new 802.11 probe that makes it harder but you could still track based on a single unique SSID probed for (i.e. something more unique than NETGEAR).<p>I&#x27;m going to look into this and possibly update my tool iSniff GPS.",1402299627

Would this extension framework allow an app to stream a file and have it played in another app. For instance, on my Android TV stick I can open my network share in ES File Browser and click on a file and have it play via MX Player. The ES Browser streams the files via samba  from the server and then passes it to MX Player to play. Would the Apple extension system allow for this type of model.<p>I am just using video as an example. I guess in general I am wondering if the new Apple framework would allow the host app to continuously stream content to an extension. So, I guess another example would be like a website. If it&#x27;s a dynamic website in spanish, for instance, and I would like to use Bing to convert it to english. Would it be possible to design an extension that would dynamically translate the site, or would it be more of a static deal, where once translated, you have to execute the extension again to translate additional dynamic content that may have appeared on the same page.<p>Also, apple claimed that they are going to expose GPU to apps, so you can now write apps that can offload calculations to the GPU.

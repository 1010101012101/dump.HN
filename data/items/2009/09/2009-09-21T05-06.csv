834067,comment,833434,834002,0,0,netsp,,,"I have come across gay men from Orthodox Jewish backgrounds. Since secular or even atheist Jews are a perfectly possible thing to be, they can have an identity as Gay & Jewish. Most go that path. But some seem to want exactly what this article is talking about to be developed. They want some smart rabbis to come up with some smart reasons around the contradiction.<p>The Jewish tradition doesn't really emphasise a rule against homosexuality as much as many think. Many of the much more explicit rules (eg. If your brother dies, you get his wife) have ways around them or are ignored. They are sort of vaguely interested in the how and have this sort of instinctive understanding that it's possible.",1253511405

Here's how I would set it up:<p><pre><code>  1. Sign up with affiliate networks (LinkShare and Commission Junction, etc.)
  2. Set up website to allow people to post product price requests
  3. As requests come in, automatically create Amazon Mechanical Turk HITs to search for product and price
  4. Use affiliate API or have outsourced team (India, Philippines, etc.) create link for product.
  5. Reply to user (a la Priceline.com) or post to site that you have found their price, and display link or require registration to get link, whatever you decide works</code></pre>",1253511191

834056,comment,833591,833591,0,0,roundsquare,,,"The time frame is very problematic.  With most Grameen style lending, there are several year long cycles where the size of the loan increases each year.  So in year 1 you get a tiny loan, if you pay it back then in year 2 you get a slightly less tiny loan, etc...<p>In the first year, its fairly common for that loan to be used to refinance a loan at a really high interest rate from a local money lender, but this does provide some benefit.  Now you are paying back a loan at 15% instead of 50%.<p>Also, a lot of the money goes into paying for kids' education, something that will not have any real ROI in the short term.  I'm curious about the mention that education hasn't improved, from what I've seen this doesn't match but I haven't really done a large scale survey.<p>Its true, some recipients use the money for non profit-making activities (e.g wedding dowries), but my understanding is that many of these would happen anyway with loans at a higher interest rate.<p>In any event, anyone who thinks that one type of financial instrument is going to solve poverty is mis-guided, but I don't know that these studies really show a lot.",1253510877

I know, for anecdote's sake, that Tweetie is almost certainly the most-used application on my phone. If you want to belittle Wired or iPhone users or Twitter users (and Lord knows it's trendy to do so), feel free, but do expect to get hit with the occasional bout of sarcasm in response (just as I expect that people who believe in the myth of the Wonderful Hacker News Comment Community will downmod all such comments into oblivion).<p>As for ""discourse"", well, I've been active here for a while and lurking for longer, and my first impression was that HN was a site that syndicated TechCrunch articles. Took me a while to realize there was anything other than an echo chamber here, and I'm still not entirely sure about that.",1253510624

Price is somehere between the maximum the buyer is willing to pay, considering his other options & the minimum the seller is willing to sell at, considering his opportunity cost.<p>In a competitive market, the price usually creeps close to the latter because consumers have more and better options to consider. In a monopolistic one, it creeps closer to the latter for the opposite reason.<p>The reason the price of content might be zero in the content industry is that A) The opportunity cost for the seller is 0 & B) The market is more competitive.",1253510299

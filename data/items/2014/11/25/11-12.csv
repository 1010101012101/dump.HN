8657339,comment,8651367,8651367,0,0,nstart,,,"I know the question was meteor js vs angular js, but having developed heavily in meteorjs before it hit 1.0, I can at least speak of it. As whatthemick said, consider how much of your app needs to be in real time. Meteor js gives you a huge amount of power to wield when it comes to building real time applications, but it doesn&#x27;t lend itself very well to building a stable experience. Not that meteor js isn&#x27;t stable, just that it&#x27;s very very easy to bugger yourself while using it.<p>For me there are a few major reasons I wouldn&#x27;t use meteorjs just yet on projects I&#x27;m doing on my own.<p>1) Documentation is scrappy and is full of bad practices.<p>The best example for this is the use of the {{with}} parameter bindings; essentially the data context issues. I discovered some time ago that if you aren&#x27;t careful with data contexts you could end up causing connected methods to run many times over when something completely irrelevant changes in the data context. I in fact pushed the meteor community to give me an answer for this one but ultimately I solved it on my own (I tried the google group, IRC, and stack overflow channels). The SO question and answer can be found here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25376541/why-are-all-meteor-template-helpers-within-a-with-each-block-called-when-an-unre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25376541/why-are-all-mete...</a>\nMy google groups question which got just one answer was - <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/2VKHCK0uAtQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-core/2VKHCK0u...</a> . In that too, notice the hacky way in which it was suggested that I solve the problem.<p>2) Test Driven Development was problematic at best.<p>This problem is going away fast though so it&#x27;s a little glib of me to mention it. The meteor community is big on TDD and they are pushing to make it happen. Again though, documentation is scrappy. Separation of concerns is tough. And this brings me back to point number 1. Best practices related stuff is hard to find. I love the style of keeping use cases separate from the interface, but meteor seems to encourage mixing it all up. This makes TDD difficult because good luck trying to setup tests to run in 0.0781 seconds for that small area you are making changes on.<p>(Maybe take the above with a bit of skepticism. I haven&#x27;t used their testing framework since it hit v1 and I&#x27;ve heard they had big changes and improvements in it)<p>3) Manipulation of UI is strange.<p>Since meteor and its templating engine are bound together in a really really tight way. Meteor actually binds stuff based on the location within the HTML documentation. So if you muck around with inserting and removing elements by yourself, Meteor suddenly can&#x27;t keep track of where it&#x27;s supposed to change things. Example: We wanted to do a simple &quot;fade out and below element slides up&quot; animation when deleting a row from a table. Since meteor reacts immediately to deleting an element, you actually have to run the animation (animate the element to be deleted by fading out opacity while setting height to zero) and then run the delete function on the animation callback. Let&#x27;s assume we deleted the second row in the table. So just before the delete function runs, the second element has a style of opacity 0 and height 0. After you run the delete function, the element that was the third element (and is now the second) vanishes. Why? Because the element previously in the third row, is now in the second, and meteor thinks the second element should be invisible and it&#x27;s height should be zero. From what I know, this peculiarity is still there. The &quot;meteor&quot; way around this is to actually store the animation completed status value IN THE DB and if it&#x27;s false, the height and opacity should be explicitly set to the correct values (or something along those lines. Either way, animation status, in the db).<p>Those three points really hurt my experience of meteor js. And while I enjoyed it at its best moments, it hurt too bad at its worst for me to recommend wholeheartedly to anyone, including myself.",1416916506

The big picture is that there are hardly any functions in the standard library that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> terrible.<p>If you wanted a safe, fast printf function in C for example, one way to do it would be to provide a function that took a format string and returned a reusable handle, much like you use regular expressions in a library like PCRE.

It even opens the door to a JIT and/or AOT backend, all without major changes to the actual compiler.<p><pre><code>    void (*hello)(char const*, int);\n    if (!printf_jit (&quot;Hello %s, you have %d points\n&quot;, &hello)) {\n        /* jit failed */\n    }\n    hello (&quot;Steve&quot;, 80);\n    printf_free (hello);\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t lump C++ in the same boat.

I got into chemistry and physics too because I was was also good at those and interested in them, as I&#x27;d been for a long time. Computer Science as a thing to study didn&#x27;t occur to me until a bit later, even though I&#x27;d been programming since grade school, and learning computer science since high school. First just classes off and on, then later delving into what my graphing calculator could do and then the family computer.

In my experience they have nowhere near the level of multilingualism as Switzerland or the Nordic countries. You can go to any random Danish town and speak English, and it&#x27;s a requirement for many jobs that you be fluent in both Danish and English, with extra points for speaking a third language (e.g. everyone in the civil service, hospitals, etc. is multilingual). But in most of Germany people are functionally monolingual, at least when it comes to conversations. They may have studied French or English in school, but they cannot carry on a conversation in those languages. The main exception is educated professionals in major cities. And even among those it&#x27;s spotty: many doctors in hospitals cannot effectively communicate with patients in any language but German, and the civil service almost never can. Younger people are more likely to be at least bilingual, though; a 30-year-old doctor is more likely to speak English than a 50-year-old one.",1416915402

The following is the notice I received from Microsoft on the 24th (first notice came in October):<p>--<p>SECOND NOTICE – European Union VAT Changes Coming 1/1/2015<p>Tax laws in the European Union (EU), which govern the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate applied to business-to-consumer digital goods, are changing on 1/1/2015. This affects the VAT rate on content offered in the Windows and Windows Phone Stores. You may want to start thinking about how this change could impact your EU pricing decisions.<p>Beginning on 1/1/2015, the applicable VAT rate for paid business-to-consumer transactions for digital goods will change from 15% to the country-specific VAT rate.<p>All EU countries are Microsoft tax remit, which means the price you select in Dev Center for your app and/or in-app purchase is the final sale price to the customer and already includes applicable taxes. Microsoft then subtracts the taxes from the price prior to payout, and remits them on your behalf.<p>--<p>They then give the VAT rates for each affected EU country. Most go up to just above or below 20% VAT. Hungary goes as high as 27%, and Luxembourg, the lowest, goes up by 2% to 17%.",1416913737

8657228,comment,8656989,8656989,0,0,yaantc,,,"There&#x27;s a lot of PR / excitement aroung full duplex operation on the same channel (by opposition to what&#x27;s usually called full duplex and use separate donwlink and uplink channels), so let me be the Grinch a bit here.<p>The high level view of FD is that one removes the transmitted signal from the receive path, allowing reception. This must be done at two levels: 1) a big chunk is removed in an analog way 2) the remainder is removed in the digital domain. The reason is that no A/D converter is good enough to work only in the digital domain. Depending on the team, there is a claim of 85 to 100 dB reduction in the Tx to Rx loop. That&#x27;s impressive, but still a bit short when in LTE a device can receive at ~ -100 dBm (YMMV) and transmit at +23 dBm. And the analog removal part will have a tricky calibration: not a problem for a controlled demo, but tricky (and potentially costly) in real life.<p>On top of this, all those techniques remove the internal looping of the Tx signal to the Rx. That&#x27;s already a challenge, but then there are the external reflection: the Tx signal has a direct loop in the device, but can also bounce on surrounding walls/stuff and get back the the Rx path this way. The issue then is that there is a serie of time lags and distortions, so the UE doesn&#x27;t really know what needs to be subtracted. En the power level of such reflections is big enough to kill the reception, on its own. This reflection issue doesn&#x27;t exist for some devices like line of sight micro-wave backhaul, but is very common for all user devices (used in-door or in urban environment: no line of sight, a lot of multi-paths).<p>The reflection issue makes me pessimistic for consumer devices applications. And for other application with little / no reflections, there may be more cost efficient ways to improve things that do not require the tricky analog calibration.<p>So the teams working on FD do impressive technology, but the road to a profitable business case is still to be proven. Good luck to them, although I&#x27;m skeptical (but would be glad to be proven wrong ;).",1416913651

8657226,comment,8656385,8656385,0,0,nstart,,,"Let&#x27;s break it down a little bit.<p>First, is an ecommerce company a start up. According to the current generation&#x27;s definition of start up, kinnnda sorta. A start up is synonymous with growth. Ideally, an ecommerce company should be that, but if it is something that falls into more like bespoke systems, then no, it isn&#x27;t a start up. Yours sounds more like the product type kinda of ecommerce site (sign up and set up your shop) so yes it would fall into a start up category at some point.<p>Second, is it tech? Forget being a start up for a moment. Is an ecommerce company a tech company. Having worked in the ecommerce field, I know the answer to be this; you decide whether or not it&#x27;s tech. The ecommerce experience I had was largely a sales driven one. Tech took a back seat for it. I&#x27;ve consulted for another ecommerce company, whose primary focus was great customer care, followed by online conversion optimization. Their tech interests were limited to customer profiling and facebook ad targeting. None of them were tech start ups. They were just start ups (ish).<p>This begs a question. What makes a startup a tech startup? For example, what makes medium a tech startup? In their case it&#x27;s all about the experience of the writing application and reading. Technology is solving tough problems and driving them forward. And that&#x27;s really it, is technology solving the problem? More importantly, is tech driving the business forward.<p>In the cases I mentioned, tech was the back seat. Tech enabled us for sure, and if the site was down we&#x27;d be dead. But really, it was just a magento site with a custom theme on top of it.<p>In your case, beyond building out the initial product, what&#x27;s going to be a primary driver of the business here? Is it all about the marketing? Pushing sales people hard? Being crazy about customer service? Building a product that does some technically amazing things along the lines of data crunching? Thing is, you probably don&#x27;t know yourself. You might like to think it&#x27;s all about the product, but at some point you might decide that you&#x27;ve done enough on the product and everything is driven by a &#x27;phone-to-phone&#x27; aggressive salesforce. Who knows?<p>Short answer to your question so far, if you envision fast growth of users, and your business is driven by technology solving real world hard problems, then it&#x27;s a tech startup and yes, a hacker/techie would get behind it. A start up using tech is not the same as a start up driven by tech. As for interest, techies are attracted by interesting problems. The best way to know if you&#x27;ve got an interesting problem on your hand, is to talk to them about it, and see if they are interested.<p>Heck, I got behind the ecommerce venture I was in simply because I was using technology to solve backend problems in the company. That&#x27;s what got my gears rolling.<p>But all this raises a more serious question. Are you doing this primarily because you are fascinated with the idea of a tech startup? Or are you doing this because you have a real problem that you&#x27;ve (ideally) validated and you want to solve and you need strong technology backing it? You&#x27;ve probably guessed the answer should never be the former. One last note before ending this long comment, don&#x27;t force your startup to be a &#x27;tech&#x27; one.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not and that&#x27;s cool.",1416913614

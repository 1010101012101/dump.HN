6276448,comment,6273692,6276136,3,0,dpritchett,,,"Here&#x27;s a link to an example of that coping strategy from some bad Clojure I wrote last night [1].  I sometimes use an accumulation of lets for a similar effect, but only when describing simpler transformations.<p>The lets might look like so (warning- silly example):<p><pre><code>    (defn n-squared-over-two-plus-three-as-str [n]\n      (let [squared (* n n)\n            halved  (/ squared 2.0)\n            added   (+ halved 3)]\n        (str added)))\n     \n    > (n-squared-over-two-plus-three-as-str 1)\n    &quot;3.5&quot;\n</code></pre>\nSure, I <i>could&#x27;ve</i> just done this as a deeply-nested structure:<p><pre><code>    > ((fn [n] (str (+ 3 (#(/ % 2.0) (* n n))))) 1)\n    &quot;3.5&quot;\n</code></pre>\n... but it&#x27;s harder to read, debug, and reason about.  You wouldn&#x27;t do that in a non-functional language either!  I suppose the tolerance for deep nesting is different for different programmers.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/dpritchett/cloball/blob/62300d31666ab12613f82e929fd11fcacb9f4007/src/cloball/core.clj#L38"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dpritchett/cloball/blob/62300d31666ab1261...</a>",1377518352

6276442,comment,6275858,6275858,2,0,nikic,,,"Obligatory comment: Nowadays nearly nothing uses actually &quot;regular&quot; regexes, which is also the reason why regex engines are typically using backtracking and not Thompson NFAs.<p>For general-purpose applications (e.g. use in programming languages) people usually want a regex flavor with support for at least backreferences and typically also (recursive) subpattern references. Note: Adding support for backreferences makes matching regexes an NP-complete problem (as opposed to a simple linear-time algorithm without them).<p>(But of course, having fast NFA implementations for really-regular regexes is still useful. After all a large part of the regexes you typically write will not use backreference etc)",1377518257

But I kind of suck at it. During a more frustrating sessions, after some groans and curses my girlfriend naively asked me: &quot;If the game makes you so angry and frustrated, why do you keep playing it? Why don&#x27;t you play another game?&quot;. It made me think. I guess I like being challenged. And the harder and the more times I fall, the better is the feeling when I finally win.

The worst is during Jan to early March when you get 6-8 weeks of cold weather.  It&#x27;s only down around 10C but the buildings aren&#x27;t insulated and everything is made of tile, so the wind slices through the walls and the tiles suck the heat out of your body.  A lot of these housing blocks are built on top of enormous shopping malls, or train stations or both.  And getting to and from work every day means pushing your way through what my Chinese wife used to call &quot;a sea of people&quot; which people in the West would only see if you went into a city for fourth of july, or new years eve  fireworks....

Much like when a bear is chasing you, you only have to be faster than those around you. Eventually the bear will chase you again and you&#x27;ll be the only one left. To make that a little more concrete, you can only keep moving while there are viable places to move <i>to</i>. Sure, that&#x27;s probably fine for our lifetimes but we&#x27;re handing on a legacy where we refuse to fight for anything. When these machines and processes are everywhere they become even harder to fight against.<p>Edit: Also, moving when you have family (partner, kids), becomes even <i>more</i> complex and stressful.

I propose looking into that aspect a bit more.

Planes are somewhat decent means of transportation on long, rarely travelled distances, but for everything else, both cars and trains are the more ecological, economical and scalable way to get from A to B. Unfortunately, both cars and planes (and, to a lesser extent, trains) are still subsidised to a large extent, masking the real costs of going from A to B in a little tube with wings, thirty other people and so-and-so many litres of kerosine.<p>If you had to pay the real price to use airplanes (i.e. the costs of airports, air traffic control, standard-taxed kerosine, appropriate taxes to revert the ecological destruction caused by airplane traffic etc.), youd prefer to walk.",1377514919

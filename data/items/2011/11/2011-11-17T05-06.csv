This seems to be the case (and yes, I'm generalizing here) for complex software solutions that have either many components, or are sold as a single complex point product.<p>Quick, effective customer support in the form of P1 issue resolution would be the second highest praise one aims to receive from a customer. Your point about the ""best customer support is customer support that is not needed"" is the highest praise of all (especially in an infrastructure play).<p>Quality customer support undoubtedly helps with customer satisfaction and often is one of the underlying factors to  sales' ability to up(sell|grade) existing customers.<p>Your unhappy customers may be a marketing or sales issue; not necessarily a customer support problem.<p>As such, without additional information, my answer is ""F"", qualified with ""you may have framed this question incorrectly.""<p>Customer support can be considered a last line of defense to help resolve deeper issues, such as fundamental dissatisfaction with the product. The feedback that you hopefully take back from disgruntled customers should be fed back to your sales and marketing organizations to understand if the problems are indicative of a larger trend (i.e. product/solution not meeting needs of key customers), or if the lost customers were one-offs with specific circumstances unlikely to 'spread' to other customers.<p>EDIT: Added last paragraph.",1321509595

Maybe you've just seen too many examples that took OO to an extreme, and those soured your taste for the whole style of programming.<p>Objects <i>can</i> be used judiciously and combined with other programming styles to do very powerful things.  Even in 2011 it's not shameful to fall back on a plain C function or data structure in cases where objects don't really add anything of value (not that many programmers seem to, but I digress).<p>It also depends on the language and what the code does.  In C++ for instance, if you happen to be working in code that relies on the C++ exceptions model (ignoring for the moment that some argue quite correctly to avoid C++ exceptions), you <i>must</i> use objects in order for cleanup code to be executed in every possible case.

3246547,comment,3245756,3246133,1,0,fritzy,,,"Essentially, that's our take as well. However, we do have a plan for dealing with conflicts and missed updates soon -- probably after Thoonk.js 1.0 slated for late December. Here's how I replied to this question on the blog comments:<p>The data in the thoonk feeds are never edited locally on the client. Any user-actions that change data go out as a websocket rpc call, and get placed in a job queue. The workers validate the data, check ACL, and then update the corresponding feeds, which then bubbles back up to the user. This happens nearly instantly, and the feed updates are atomic. If two users edit an object, then the last edit wins. For the data we have, this isn't a problem. However, we've got a plan for dealing with concurrency and conflict resolution in the future so that we can can handle being offline for periods of time, and detecting and dealing with conflicts. 
--<p>For &bang in particular, we'll probably just let the user that owns the task resolve the conflicts. ""You queued an update to this task while offline, but Bob edited as well. Which version would you like to keep?""  In general, you can't edit eachother's data, but you can add to it, so it isn't much of a problem.<p>Thoonk 1.0 will have update history and incrementing revision numbers for feeds that will give you enough information to resolve your conflicts (whatever the method you choose is) and will help your app recognize and retrieve missed updates.",1321507930

Well I did as I was told and I now have several friends who have bought many of their other albums , attended a few concerts, and bought some T-shirts and whatnot all because I shared that one CD with them.

BFG was around for a year and a half or more and has considerable test coverage, is actively developed, actively maintained. There was a sprint held at PloneConf last week and a number of presentations which resulted in a large number of issues being dealt with.<p>If you're coming from Django, you might find Pyramid a little offputting at first. It is a non-opinionated framework which means they don't make too many decisions for you. Template language, form library, etc aren't decided for you. I find this to be a good thing, but, if you're looking to pull together a bunch of pieces to toss an app together, you might be a little disappointed.<p>Many of the developers hang out on irc.freenode and groups.google and are pretty responsive.<p>I use it all the time for many different apps. I find it to be pretty lightweight, does what I need it to do, doesn't get in my way and doesn't have too much cruft. Relatively easy to deploy - almost identical to Django.<p>I don't believe Graham Dumpleton has gotten NewRelic's monitoring agents working with Pyramid yet if that is a concern.",1321506263

The economic theory is that law should incentivize people to act a certain way, and that if the odds of prosecution are low than the deterrent effect has to be made up on the sentencing side instead.<p>I don't really know what the 'right' policy is.",1321506234

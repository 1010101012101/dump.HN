These object are not rendered the same as formatting is by the browser.<p>So in your example that select box has a list method which doesn&#x27;t have a property that supports indentation.<p>You&#x27;d have to write a new set of methods that extend the current form inputs.

A bit later in the document they say<p>> If you decide to reimplement one of the APIs for which &quot;Reimplementable independently&quot; is &quot;no&quot;, then we won&#x27;t stop you, but you are on your own.<p>so I think they mean to say sth different than &quot;the APIs can&#x27;t be tried to be implemented at all&quot;.<p>I think when they say &quot;reimplementable independently&quot; they mean &quot;to develop a feature-par system&quot;, which might be way too strict. For example, the unit format also is marked as &quot;not reimplementable independently&quot;, when it is clear it is in some form; plausibly, some attributes one can specify in unit files as implemented by systemd can&#x27;t be replicated in other systems, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there can&#x27;t be similar, partially-compatible implementations. I guess in some (most?) cases, those might be enough.<p>Also, logind&#x27;s case might be marked as not reimplementable independently to discourage forks like Ubuntu&#x27;s, which caused their version to remain stagnant when the API changed upstream. I&#x27;m not sure, but logind&#x27;s API might still be a moving target, so a reimplementation might have to face some issues.",1398376470

In SV, this could lead to a cooling down (or worse) of the labor market.  The established players (Google, Apple, Amazon, etc) will probably pull through alright, but the VC money will thin out.  If I was a software engineer and I wanted to hedge my bets, I would probably try get a job at one of the bigger, more stable companies in the next year.  If things do cool down, I imagine that programmer jobs and salaries will be the most noticeable side effect.<p>Of course I could be entirely wrong.

I most often now see Google+ used for posts that are set to private within a family. Thanksgiving plans shared just among a family. Your friends on Facebook don&#x27;t care about that, but your siblings do, and Google+ makes it much easier than Facebook to maintain a circle for that sort of thing. You just create a Circle called Family, and after you use it a couple of times, Google defaults your posts to that circle. To the world it looks like you&#x27;ve <i>never</i> posted on Google+, but meanwhile you&#x27;ve been sharing pictures and funny jokes with your brothers and sisters <i>every day</i><p>And if you don&#x27;t use Google+ this way, but most of your family has a Google+ account (is it possible to not have one anymore?)

The cash is cheaply financed by low-cost debt and it has utility as an insurance-liquidity-pool-of-last resort in the case of a policy reversal by the Fed.<p>For argument&#x27;s sake, assume debt is mis-priced right now relative to equity. If you believe that, and you are a bank, what you do is increase ROE through increasing leverage (shor debt markets+long equity). So, if you are a bank you borrow and buy back shares. Or, you borrow and keep shares at a minimum/flat.<p>On the other side of your ledger, if you are a bank and you believe debt is mis-priced, the last thing you want to be doing is going long credit (to customers). So, what you should expect is increasing debt/equity ratio and flat/decreasing proportion of long-credit/total assets.<p>The &quot;stingy credit&quot; allegation is perfectly rational if you make the assumption that debt is fundamentally mis-priced as an asset class. That is the essential assuption Wilson is making to explain why money is chasing equity/pe/vc.<p>The only open issue is whether or not the assumption is correct.<p>If we look at policy, when regulators ring-fence reserve and increase the reserve level, they are forcing the banks to sell-equity. The reason they are doing this is because--assuming equity is mis-priced--they understand that banks will leverage up. The problem with banks leveraging up increasingly over time is policy hysterisis.<p>If the fed policy results in increasing bank leverage, the baking system will become increasing more &quot;brittle&quot;. This tie the hands of the Fed--when they move to revert policy--they will risk creating a problem due to having added &quot;brittleness&quot; to the financial system.<p>So, even the fed is acting as if the assumption about debt pricing is true.<p>That being said, it is a more difficult case to explain from first principles whether or not debt is truly mis-priced as an asset class. But the analysis can be followed as far as I can tell simpley based on the binary assimpyion (yes/no). And one of those assumptinos seems to explain alot, while the other faces a harder time making sense of the data we are seeing.<p>From your piece:<p><i>The hope is that the lower interest rates will encourage people and businesses to take out more loans and thereby start spending again.</i><p>What we are seeing is opportunistic borrowing for financial engineering. We are not seeing 1:1 borrowing to spending on operating expenses or PPE. We are seeing borrowing that is being spent on share-buy-backs and/or cash-stockpiles that maked increasing leverage ratios more operationally risk-tolerant. (And it seems this is true for corporates and financials, at least to a first order approximation.)",1398373876

Once the first case is confirmed by a blood test, every person who cares for an infected patient must wear a hazmat suit, gloves, a mask and protective goggles and exercise extreme caution when administering treatment. Decontamination chambers are generally installed between the isolated patients and the external environment. To confine the epidemic, it is critical to trace the entire transmission chain. All individuals who have had contact with patients who may be contaminated are monitored and isolated at the first sign of infection. The affected communities must also be informed about the illness and the precautions to be taken to limit risks of contamination. Basic hygiene – such as washing one’s hands – can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.</i><p>1: <a href=""http://www.msf.org/article/guinea-%E2%80%9Cthere-no-treatment-and-no-vaccine-ebola-priority-isolate-suspected-cases%E2%80%9D"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msf.org/article/guinea-%E2%80%9Cthere-no-treatmen...</a>",1398373379

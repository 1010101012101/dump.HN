I don't max them because for a while, my returns were lower than my student loan interest rates and I felt it be a better use of my money at the time.<p>Until my loans are paid off, I will be sticking with just those 3 retirement accounts.<p>I pick my own ETFs because I'm super type A, but it's based on crowd appeal. So if I find 5 experts recommend an ETF, and it has a low management fee, I'm likely to purchase it.<p>I stick strickly to ETFs (but in all asset classes, such as bonds) because the rate of return generally exceeds CDs and Bonds, and I don't need the money at the moment. Plus, Bonds and CDs pay out so low that I'd rather just have my money in a high interest (hah) savings account.<p>What else do YOU have in mind?

If javascript exists, scoop up the html and introspect it to build your rich widget. If the javascript never loads, you have a working page.<p>This, I believe is a good use of custom data attributes. When your JS introspects the html, it can use data here for configuration and setting values. It's messy and often impossible to use the same values you output to html in your javascript models.

I really do think banks gain a kind of veneer of respectability from their proximity to money, rather than an intrinsic worth in what they do.

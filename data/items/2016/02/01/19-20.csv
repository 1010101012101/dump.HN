11014889,comment,11011343,11013352,0,0,tzs,,,"> Already a lot of counterfeit users of FTDI (i.e. knockoff Arduinos and cheap &quot;VAG-COM KKL&quot; auto diagnostic cables) are switching to CH340 instead of buying real FTDI.<p>The driver situation for CH340 seems a bit sketchy. Whenever I&#x27;ve considered buying cheap Arduino Uno R3 clones via aliexpress.com, but then first went searching for CH340 OS X drivers, all I&#x27;ve found have been drivers on random sites whose provenance seems to be &quot;I found this somewhere&quot;. Often these are unsigned drivers so I&#x27;d have to disable driver signing to use them, although last time I looked there was a set of signed drivers floating around.<p>For Arduino knockoffs, I prefer something that uses the same hardware that a genuine Arduino would use, or something that works with the CDC driver that comes with the OS. For Uno R3, this is the clone I&#x27;m using for development [1]. It uses an ATmega16u2 to handle the USB, which is what a genuine Uno R3 uses.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P2FX9WY?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P2FX9WY?psc=1&redirect=t...</a>",1454356692

The medical device might still be bricked if the computer accessing the device runs Windows Update.</i><p>Yes, exactly.<p>I used to work at a sub-contractor for a large manufacturer of medical equipment, and all the systems we dealt with were like that. The device would run a very small embedded OS but would have a serial port for talking to a PC for firmware development, firmware updates, logging, diagnostics, etc. Their older stuff used real hardware serial ports, but their newer systems (~6-7 years ago now) were moving to virtual USB/FTDI serial ports, with an FTDI chip included in the embedded system.<p>These tricky FTDI drivers would absolutely have the potential to brick and/or alter the operation of such a device; it&#x27;s not far-fetched or a flight of fancy at all.<p>I have a special interest in this thread/issue because I have recently been contacted by that manufacturer regarding one of these FTDI-using systems which has recently begun to exhibit new problems.

After that, I decided that I need a &quot;change of scenery&quot; and to explore the big world of professional software development.<p>The second company, which I currently work for since a year now, is however somewhat very different.\nI&#x27;ve started my career with an already existing business project (imagine your typical java enterprise project here -> rdbms + application server + java rich client), supporting it, making the clients happy with _everything_ they want.<p>It was in a really bad condition (architecture, software design, ui design of the main application, the client was fed up with), but it was doable, so I decided to make a change. I started developing a new client, with modern design and a cross plattform approach, and everyone loved it, I got great response from everyone and the project even got a stockup of developers from 2 to 6 - just because of my work and the resulting interest of the client (= more money++ for my company for a project which was theoretically thought dead). Everything was great.<p>The last 3-4 month however were terrible. \nI learned enough about this project to understand of what hell im into now: the client hasn&#x27;t the slightest idea of what this project is doing anyways. The team leader had no experience in leading teams or even projects, because he was actually an architect which has done a solo job on this project for 4-5-6 years now.<p>After all, the project was developed because the client&#x27;s company had money. But this is a different story, however...<p>The feature requests of the client were getting more and more, the time to accomplish goals was getting less and less. There wasn&#x27;t even time anymore to test things, (I know, testing - haha, but this company is pretty well known in the world of testing and test-consulting, every other project there is heavily tested for example), or to get rid of technical dept. - every accomplished jira task was just a patch of code and hopes, pushed into the project git, hoping that everything will work - but of course, if you changed something, everything fell down like theres no tomorrow.<p>I just couldn&#x27;t work like this anymore, I&#x27;ve tried it several times to talk with my boss or my project lead to get rid of, or at least, minimize the impact of technical dept on this project, because it was the main problem which consumed most of the time AND budget, when solving features for the client. After the &quot;critical path&quot; of this project, and 2 happy clients, we had a sit in with the whole team, including the team leader, and my boss.<p>We talked about everything, what went good, what went wrong, how to improve ourselfs and how to manage clients in order to prevent something like this the next time and I was really, really happy with it.<p>As the time went by, the project lead was taking a break because of way to many additional workhours, I was fine with it. It was just one month to go until new year, and after that, I thought, everything will be fine - of course it wasn&#x27;t.<p>The workload doubled in this month, no team lead, just me and my coworkers who had just half of an idea of this _great_great_ project. Anyways, we&#x27;ve made it. Everything the client wished for was done and even more, they were happy.<p>As my vacation began and the new year started, I fell into a deep depressive hole. Me and my project lead were so terrible burned out, that after 3 weeks of vacation, I needed another 3 weeks just to get into real life again. Today is my last free day of this 6 week timeout and I hope that I&#x27;ve got enough power and endurance to get back on track.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a lot about company politics in the last year, how to handle clients, new coworkers, bosses and a lot of do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s on enterprise java development. But I&#x27;ve also learned alot about the &quot;darkside&quot; of software development.<p>I love the craftmenship and all the clever thoughts and every single person I&#x27;ve worked with - but if you start a career in that industry or a new job be aware, that money is the only thing that counts at the end of the day. So be grateful if you&#x27;re getting paid to play with the newest technology or just try stuff out.<p>P.S. - Sorry for the long personal post and the horrible spelling, english is not my native language.

If productivity expectations are set based an open office, then the increase with the more expensive private offices is unknown.<p>Additionally, high overhead increases risk. Maximum productivity is only important as long as you have more work than there are employees to do it. What if there&#x27;s a downturn (as in 2008)? Now you&#x27;re locked into an expensive lease and no longer have the revenue to support it. The company with lower overhead can hold out longer until things turn around. Employees can be laid off.

People become like you describe; they master the do nothing job via office cult cargoism. It must be exhausting to have a &#x27;fake&#x27; job like this and knowing damn well that if you lose this job you may have nowhere to go.<p>I think 100 years from now our great grandkids will be living in an automation utopia and look at our daily work lives as something just a harrowing as any story from Kafka. There&#x27;s a lot of craziness we let slide because we&#x27;ve convinced ourselves total employment is one of the main moral goals of a capitalistic society. Its probably not sustainable in later stages capitalism.<p>In my lifetime I expect to see GMI deployments in various nations as automation keeps eating the world. I have yet to be convinced that the status quo can be maintained and the cracks on the facade are already showing. Later stages capitalism is a totally different beast than early stages. This is all new ground.<p>Not too long ago this sounded like crazy sci-fi talk to me, but now that I&#x27;m in a partial management position I&#x27;ve been involved with hirings/firings and all sorts of staffing and productivity issues, this has shown me that employment in general is something of an illusion. I&#x27;d say 80% of the work/value done here is by 30 or 40% of the staff, maybe 20% if we&#x27;re being really tough. A lot of hiring, if not most, is vanity hiring by VP&#x27;s who want more people under them for status and budget reasons. This isn&#x27;t some rational engine at work here. Its its own kind of bubble and as we saw in the 2008 mortgage crisis, it gets deflated pretty easily when money stops coming in. (5% to 10% unemployment in 12 months 2008-2009).",1454356195

Literally turning your back on the room and refusing to go to meetings makes you unpopular. It&#x27;s true that your popularity among your superiors is the most important popularity, but popularity among your peers is also important; if you can&#x27;t get the respect of your subordinates you won&#x27;t be an effective manager. People will work to undercut you. In 99% of cases, you won&#x27;t get their respect if they think you don&#x27;t like them.<p>In aggregate, peoples&#x27; behaviors are very predictable. Before every action, ask if this kind of thing would endear a toddler to you or not. If it would, it&#x27;s a good thing to do. If it wouldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s going to be an uphill battle and you&#x27;ll have to do many toddler-approved things to undo the damage.<p>This is why you should bring donuts for the office every week; toddlers love getting edible treats, and so do grownups. Make sure everyone knows you&#x27;re the one who brought them, without looking like you&#x27;re making sure everyone knows that you&#x27;re the one who brought them. This will make people like you more.<p>Turn your desk around and start going to all their meetings. Say supportive and encouraging things. Make irrelevant broad, philosophical statements, literally stuff you&#x27;d find on motivation posters. You&#x27;ll get popular fast.<p>If you care about your career, you must realize that your actual job is only ~20% of what you&#x27;re paid for. You&#x27;re really paid to be likeable and charming, someone that everyone wants to keep around the office. Do whatever you have to do to keep your code limping along and then put the rest of your energy into becoming popular. You&#x27;ll be promoted and tasked to hire a version of yourself that hasn&#x27;t learned these lessons yet, and the cycle will continue.",1454356136

The point of this rule is that you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re bitter or holding a grudge; if the new company thinks you create vendettas whenever there&#x27;s a problem, they&#x27;re going to want to stay away from you for fear that you&#x27;ll be unfair to them if such a misunderstanding arises in the course of your employment with them (e.g., hurting their reputation in the marketplace, leaking source code because you&#x27;re mad at your boss).<p>It&#x27;d be reasonable to say something like &quot;We had different perspectives on the structure of the workplace and it just wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for&quot;.

This is a good principle when discussing previous employers anyway. You always want to sound like you&#x27;re over whatever the slight was, that you see and understand their perspective and don&#x27;t blame them for having it, but simply don&#x27;t agree with it.

The free software folks that were criticizing the usage of BitKeeper for the Linux kernel weren&#x27;t able to offer alternatives, whereas Git was born from the hands of the same pragmatists that were using BitKeeper. Linux itself, along with the GNU toolchain, happened after Multics, Unix, 80386 and MINIX. Well OK, the GNU project was started before 80386, but nevertheless it was started as a clone of Unix. You can see that from its recursive name.<p>Or in other words, sometimes what you call proprietary software also represents innovation that can be copied and innovated upon should the need arise.

And when I say that I don&#x27;t mean it in the shallow way most people do, I mean actually literally fundamentally broken. Here&#x27;s why: The average human reads somewhere between 150-300wpm. A decent typist types at 60wpm. If we take 300wpm as an optimistic estimate of average reading speed, the moment you&#x27;re having a lively discussion the channel is swamped at seven participants or so. Slack makes multithreading easy by associating multiple topic &#x27;channels&#x27; together for a single group so that you can talk about one topic in this channel and another topic in that channel and it&#x27;s not confusing or unwieldy, people who want to hear about certain topics can subscribe to a channel and people who don&#x27;t can just not subscribe or leave. You don&#x27;t have this &#x27;stepping on each others toes&#x27; problem where three people want to talk about this and three people want to talk about that and they all use the same channel to do it.<p>Avatars, emoticons, that stuff is all a bit tacky but the core fundamentals of the design are a sound improvement over IRC, and IRC needs to respond to that.",1454355504

RxJS provides a standardized (and cross-language [1]) &quot;standard language&quot; of working with reactive flows. It&#x27;s very nice to have a reusable &quot;toolbox&quot; like RxJS and knowing that the skills you put into using it transfer to just about any other language you might want to use (and vice versa, I first used RX in C#). While there are RxJS integrations into React, the benefit to Cycle is that in presuming (and building explicitly on top of) RxJS it ends up being a relatively small &quot;glue library&quot; and a set of documented conventions for RX observables (&quot;event streams&quot;), more than a complicated chunk of &quot;framework code&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://reactivex.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reactivex.io</a>",1454355501

This can be easily tested if you know how to factor p: the order of the multiplicative group (Zp)* is the euler&#x27;s totient function on p. If you know the order of the multiplicative group then you have an algorithm to find the order of your generator: you try all the divisors of the group&#x27;s order, see the smallest one that works.<p>Unfortunately, if you don&#x27;t know how to factor p then you can&#x27;t easily do that.<p>Another question is: How can they know it&#x27;s not a prime if they don&#x27;t know the factorization of p?

My car can tell me speed limits, which lane to be in, and knows information about all major roads in the area.<p>Your car navigation isn&#x27;t &quot;positive control.&quot; It can&#x27;t slow your car down for you, and when it fucks up (like Uber&#x27;s navigation does 50% of the time on the way to Union Station), it can&#x27;t fuck up control of the car.

You could hack together an app to tell an Amtrak driver the speed limit in any given location, but that wouldn&#x27;t have helped Amtrak 188. To prevent that crash you needed a system that can override the train operator and slow the train.<p>Once you give the computer authority to override the driver, a huge amount of complexity sets in.<p>First, a substantial portion of the Northeast Regional track does not have cellular coverage.

As far as I&#x27;m aware, proceeding without movement authority is a far more common cause of rail accidents than overspeed, hence why systems have traditionally been mostly concerned with separation and movement authority rather than speed.<p>Really the biggest flaw of the US&#x27;s push for PTC is reinventing the wheel: ETCS[0] has been standardising this all over Europe (with parts, such as GSM-R, being adopted in large parts of the world!), and the goals for PTC largely match up with ETCS Level 2, as far as I&#x27;m aware. There are a number of off-the-shelf systems available, leaving the largest issue as GSM-R frequency acquisition. And, I suppose, the political issue of using a non-American system.<p>ETCS Level 3 essentially allows pure-radio positioning, but there&#x27;s currently no planned deployments because nobody yet has constructed a system that meets the required &quot;safety integrity level&quot;. Note that one of the issues here is you need devices at both the lead and rear vehicles to ensure train integrity, whereas currently typically one only has such equipment in the driving vehicle(s). There&#x27;s hope to use the EGNOS satellite augmentation system to get better accuracy guarantees than GPS/GLONASS/Galileo provide, but it&#x27;s all still experimental, and the only experimental project there failed.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System</a> (an article which I will openly say defines far too little jargon it uses!)",1454354781

I really wanted to wait at least for version 2 as I thought of it as way to gimmicky and clumbersome for above reasons. I got one for my mother as a birthday gift and surrendered some days after that to get mine soon after as she was calling me specifically to tell me how much she loved it. Long story short to my great surprise I really like it. Like a lot. I find myself reaching for my phone much less than before and as a consequence I am much less inclined to follow Twitter/Facebook/Email OCD than before. When I check some notification / reminder on my watch there is nothing to do due to the severely limited software. Apart from a quick glance and maybe a very short reply there is little I can do with it. The &quot;apps&quot; are - apart from the watch face - very slow don&#x27;t offer a lot of notifications. But surprisingly it covers the things I use my phone most for on a daily basis: Checking notifications, setting timers, adding reminders, navigation. It handles these things well for me yet. While being miles away from that it reminds me of the movie &quot;her&quot; where technology gets rid of visual interfaces and fades away from the &quot;glowing squares&quot; to are the ubiquitous screens of today. And for that reason alone it is much more and something completely different than a smartphone with a tiny screen. Sadly though there are nearly no apps that use the tactile interface etc in a innovative / surprising way for e.g. real life games or something like that just yet. But this will hopefully change over time. One last thing that I really find worthwhile sitting in front of a screen way to much is the activity tracking and reminders to &quot;stand up and move for a minute&quot;. In combination with my whitings a lot of aspects of my life are now measured completely automatic and continuously (Hearth Rate, Weight, Distance Walked, Steps, Body Fat, Workouts) which I value quite a bit.

Sure, let someone decide to be &quot;princess sparkles&quot; for a day or whatever, but I NEVER want to have to figure out who is who in order to be able to open a query window, don&#x27;t want an existing query window to stop working because they changed their nick for a joke in some channel I&#x27;m not in, I never want to split logs of messages with people based on whether they were john or john|break... etc.<p>Regardless of MY technical competency or capacity for burning time, I will still need non-technical project-helper person to be able to spend an afternoon to create a handful of Trello boards and channels, and make those boards&#x27; changes push to their respective channels.<p>And even though I myself can suck it up and jump those hurdles, I&#x27;ll never get a majority of my friends or colleagues to do so.

I spent the last three years learning to program because I had an idea for a website. I created it, but frankly, I don&#x27;t have the business background nor the proficiency to be a one-man startup success story. I&#x27;ve learned MySQL, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, Laravel, HTML, CSS, some Python, and a lot about general computing. I&#x27;m an excellent typer, and I&#x27;m savvy with most tech.

I read job requirements, and I feel like most startups or tech companies would choose someone with a computer science degree or more legitimate programming skills. I tell myself that I can&#x27;t get a job as a counselor since I don&#x27;t have a Masters degree. I also feel like my limited references (having worked for myself the last 3 years) will hold me back from getting any position that pays over 40k a year.<p>The frustration here is that I am extremely valuable to many companies, but without a strong résumé, I figure I&#x27;ll be glossed over for a stronger on-paper candidate.

I&#x27;m also glad they realize a lot of these decisions were made by people with trade-offs that aren&#x27;t obvious years down the line. So, it has to be done carefully. I agree with moron4hire that this is a <i>very</i> shallow take at it where it&#x27;s basically just syntax. Prior studies on programming languages, particularly for quality or composition, showed certain features had strong benefits compared to other languages without them. I started on a list of examples proven by evidence in academic studies or field use:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10734477"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10734477</a><p>I&#x27;d like to see them start with what&#x27;s been proven. Syntax was my lowest worry as COBOL and BASIC were used successfully by laypeople because they looked like pseudocode. So, just start with a BASIC then modify by how people solve the problem. Most issues in software defects and maintenance have nothing to do with syntax. It&#x27;s an improper expression or manipulation of data, control, or interfaces. The techniques above address those.<p>So, I challenge anyone wanting to explore evidence-oriented paradigm (aka do science) and improve SW development to start on those techniques. Pull up all the scientific literature that puts them to the test against conventional alternatives. Look at the logic behind solutions & the results in terms of numbers. Re-run the studies using Quorum-style methods along w/ attention to reducing any biases. Use test data (eg applications) that embed realistic errors or integration problems that can show or refute the above&#x27;s value in facilitating robust development. Once a technique is proven, start working on various approaches of doing it in both syntax and analytical model (i.e. effectiveness). Do it for all of them and we&#x27;ll have better tooling that increases effectiveness instead of just pretty syntax.<p>That&#x27;s my take on it. Good luck on that round of research.",1454353676

For example, C++ recently added a return-type syntax that resembles what you see in Rust:<p><pre><code>  auto multiply (int x, int y) -> int;  // this is valid C++\n</code></pre>\nThe reason why this syntax exists is because, well... it&#x27;s a bit complicated to explain here, read <a href=""http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-auto-decltype-return-value-after-function.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cprogramming.com/c++11/c++11-auto-decltype-return...</a> instead. :)<p>Furthermore, the `name: type` syntax is simplest solution when your language supports both patterns and type inference, as Rust does. IMO it also reads more nicely because when scanning code I care more about what a value&#x27;s name is than its type (which may only be because Rust&#x27;s type system is relatively strong, and I count on it to catch me if any types are out of place).<p>There&#x27;s also the emerging historical trend: AFAICT, every language designed in the past ten years has put the type after the variable name. Rust, Go, Swift, TypeScript, Nim, Crystal, Pony... even Python 3 (<a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/</a>). All the proposals that I&#x27;ve seen for optional types in Ruby and Javascript put the type after the name as well. And this syntax has roots in a much older language, ML, and is generally shared by ML&#x27;s descendants (such as OCaml, and also possibly Rust).",1454353413

Sure, it&#x27;s maybe worth it if you don&#x27;t have a job and this will get you jobs (but I&#x27;d be skeptical that a jobless creative would sign up for a $30 monthly fee job board). Seems like the fee would filter out applications from more talented people who have a lot of incoming work requests already but would be curious about a more curated channel. Idea: only charge for posting $$$ jobs (like craigslist) and focus on getting a roster of super talented members.",1454353279

It&#x27;s more of a feelgood/guilt piece.<p>What we should do is have programs to make better parents.  If they have children, make them take nurture programs, etc.  I know, they don&#x27;t have time... But they have time to want to raise children.  When pregnancy and parenting is by and large by choice, given they are talking about &quot;families&quot; we should come to expect more from parents in rearing their children, poor or wealthy.",1454353254

3167747,story,,,8,5,larve,"Ask HN: Should I be more entrepreneurial?",,"3 years ago, I started a one-man company building electronic hardware for artists. I did everything myself: electronics, software, manufacturing, accounting, marketing, music. The only thing lacking was any business sense whatsoever: I quickly burnt out after 2 years, realizing that I just worked 90 hour weeks making 10$ an hour.<p>Rethinking my priorities, I figured out that I actually had already reached my 4 goals in life (to use new-agey self-help blog-terms): make art, make technology, having friends and family, enjoying life. I also realized what I dont know how to do: managing people, understanding people, being business-savvy enough to make money. I have done the crazy stuff I wanted to do, and at age 29 feel like Im actually retiring, doing stuff that is just like watering my plants.<p>Since me slowly shutting my electronics venture down, Ive been quite happily freelancing halftime without trying very hard (doing electronics and software), making about 60k-80k EUR per year (living in a very low-income part of east germany, which makes me pretty much cresus), and pursuing my other projects on the side. I dont miss the excitement of having a company, and am usually happy doing one-man projects.<p>I know Im completely underselling myself as a freelancer (I work for 50$/h at the moment, although I had gigs for 100 EUR / hour this year as well), which I understand as me not actually caring. However, I think I miss the possibility of being able to pay a smart developer to develop a compiler backend for me, of having a design agency design some custom cases, of having a company in china produce a few thousand devices. Business-like endeavors that are more driven by a love for art and technology than market, which I learnt is a recipe bound for failure.<p>I know that Im quite sharp and pick up things easily. I also have a laser-like intensity, as well as enough self-discipline to reach my goals, even if they take a few years of hard work. That is, as long as I dont get bored, which is as soon as I feel that Im not learning anything anymore. Would you recommend me to:<p>* Chill out, relax, and enjoy what I have<p>* Look for someone to manage me, keeping 80% off my 20% but allowing me to have a bit of a bigger scope<p>* Manning up, study business, finance and marketing, play the game and make some serious $$$ for a few years<p>* Slowly ramp up my revenue, getting more consulting gigs rather than codemonkey gigs, getting a suit and upselling myself<p>* Slowly building up a few moneyprinting endeavours (a few iphone apps, a few webapps), either slowly building up a revenue stream or actually turning into something that someone would like to take over or nurture to $$$.",1319799106

Meanwhile Samsung - the best Android phone manufacturer right now - are also now signed up to provide Windows Phones and are investing in Bada. And pretty much all Android phone manufacturers are operating on pretty thin margins because of the competition.<p>Plus Kindle and others are starting to fragment what Android means - are app developers going to be held back by having to keep things running on the far older Fire version if they want to access what is likely to be a massive market? Oh, and those pesky little patents suits aren't going anywhere in a hurry and are likely to be, at the very least, expensive. On the upside it now has a mass market advantage and a lot of people betting on it.<p>Meanwhile Apple's previous unrivalled dominance in terms of product quality has significantly eroded (if not disappeared altogether) and it's iPod -> iPhone upgrade path is dropping away as the iPod ceases to be a big seller (though the Mac is now becoming mass market which at the very least boosts the Apple brand and awareness).<p>The iPad is still the undisputed king of tablets but that's likely to at the very least come under more sustained pressure than it has so far as further iterations of Android tablets improve. Plus the potential for a post-Jobs psychological hit exists and, those patent suits aren't just running one way.<p>And both of them are going to be threatened by Nokia and MS getting their shit together with a couple of nice looking phones, a billion dollar marketing budget and a shed load of brand recognition in the mass market space.<p>Bottom line - I don't think anyone should carp right now, this thing is a long way from playing out.",1319797331

I think it's a really good platform to build on, as demonstrated by it's growth outside of the Microsoft world.<p>This article highlights why (good) C/C++ have such a hard time moving to C#/.Net. In .Net memory management is, 99.9999999999% of the time, fire and forget, whereas a big chunk of learning and programming C/C++ is about memory management. 
Most C, and some C++, programmers would have baulked at having a massive object graph in memory - releasing it becomes a massive headache, and that's before you even get into synchronisation issues, and the .Net team have done a really good job of taking this headache away (yes, I realise they 're not the first). 
However, we're now at the point where there are a lot of C# programmers who've never heard of a linker (by default, csc compiles and links in one go), have little concept of static vs dynamic linking, and, more importantly, don't have the first clue about memory management.
This manifests itself in things like not using IDisposable properly/consistently, using the string.+ operator rather than using StringBuilder/StringWriter, and developers have no idea about the difference between class and struct, especially when it comes to parameter handling.
Even books like (the excellent) C# in Depth are pretty light on the memory management side of things, deferring this to books about the CLI and DNR. Whereas, the truth is, if you're going to write a big application, you're going to have some concept of this.",1319796103

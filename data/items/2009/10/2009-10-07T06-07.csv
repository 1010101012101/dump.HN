He could create a throwaway google account and buy a dev phone, or buy one of the many non-google-branded Android phones either already on the market or coming out this quarter, which can be used without a google account. Once you've got the phone, there's absolutely no requirement that you use a google account whatsoever. The only functionality which requires it are the google apps (gmail, maps, etc, and using the market). There's even a 3rd-party app market already out there (<a href=""http://slideme.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slideme.org/</a>)<p>I don't see how letting google knowing who he is -especially when they probably ALREADY know- is any worse than letting Palm know who he is.

Newspapers are about $10-$15 per year. ""<p>Ok Why don't you find me an Indian Edition of ""Coders At Work?"". ;-)<p>More seriously you are (somewhat) right. Some books (most <i>popular</i> technical books <i>eventually</i> become available in cheap Indian editions. <i>If</i> all books available on the Kindle  had a cheap Indian edition, your argument would have merit. There are two advantages to the Kindle over waiting for the Indian Edition of a textbook (if it ever comes out), time and convenience.<p>First technical books, there are large numbers of technical books that are <i>not</i> available in Indian Edition. Buying from Amazon isn't an option because the postage costs ramps up the price. (the ""2 day"" shipping option  doubles the price. For heavier books Amazon ads an extra 10 $ to ship to India.The lesser options often result in the book not being delivered because it got ""lost"" somewhere in transit).
 So if you order from Amazon (and many many people do, in spite of the delays and the cost , because they have no chpoice), the added postage fee more than cancels any discount.<p>Often the Indian edition books are released upto a year  or more after the foreign edition is released and the paper  and print quality is really sucky (to make it cheap I imagine.)<p>Give me an option of <i>instant</i> purchase (today  you have to order books form India and wait for weeks to see how important this is) and I'd choose that in flash. Indian booksellers often take <i>months</i> to deliver a book not in the store inventory. Indian booksellers <i>suck</i>. Even an ""Amazon India"" would destroy them if it existed.<p>And as for textbooks specifically only a <i>minor</i> subset of the good  textbooks in say Mechanical Engineering is available in Indian Edition. The situation is better for ""Perl in 21 days"" type software books.<p>For example Peter Norvig's ""Artificial Intelligence A Modern Approach "" 3d edition is slated for release at the  end of 2009 in the USA. I don't expect to see it in a cheap Indian Edition till the end of 2010.<p>I maintain that <i>if</i> the Kindle works well in India in terms of connectivity and so on (this remains to be seen), it will be a <i>huge</i> disruptive force in bookselling. Indian publishing houses are still in the 19th century as far as technology and distribution are concerned.<p>Some of my friends were trying to set up an e-publishing startup with a kindle like device and did some market research on this. (They didn't get  funding  which is another story entirely).",1254896531

8611585,comment,8611198,8611471,0,0,justsee,,,"Do you think changing the mission target of a 12 year mission on the day of landing has a scientific or bureaucratic / political motive? I&#x27;m inclined to believe it is the latter.<p>Until 12 November the FAQ [1] stated:<p><i>During the first week – the minimum mission target – a first run of the most important scientific measurements will be completed. During this phase the lander can operate on primary battery power, should this be necessary. In a second phase that is meant to last up to three months, a secondary set of observations will be conducted, using backup batteries that will be recharged by the energy from the solar cells on the lander. However, no one knows precisely how long the lander will survive on the comet.</i><p>Editing to omit the minimum mission target on 12 November [2] indicates something was already wrong at that stage, which would presumably relate to the two batteries that were to power the lander over more than a week, but no public announcement of any issue like that was made. So we should instead assume the batteries were fully operational.<p>Instead we have ESA announcements and news articles asserting that the reason for the very short period of operation was a lack of solar power, but solar was never planned to be required for over a week at least.<p>It seems obvious that they had a battery failure. That would not be surprising, but why not openly announce it?<p>[1] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140805030451/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20140805030451/http://www.esa.in...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141112043243/http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/Frequently_asked_questions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20141112043243/http://www.esa.in...</a>",1416056042

The participants are primarily those who live in the slums. Public participatory mapping projects have happened for decades now, often happening without computers and more tied into the planning side of things. The article is quite correct, for these types of mapping projects, the map is a visible end result, not the intended object. The planning part of the process is required and needed.<p>What the confusion with &quot;crowdsourcing&quot;, humanitarian mapping and public participation mapping is with OpenStreetMap - anyone can contribute from anywhere to anyplace, therefore it&#x27;s crowdsourcing. And with the recent Ebola humanitarian mapping, anyone can trace aerial imagery and add in whole towns that were never mapped before ever to a map for use by aid organisations primarily. So they both use the same stack, they both are in developing countries, but the people doing the mapping are different. local people mapping their own area and it being used not mainly by aid organisations for humanitarian purposes, and international (the true, faceless crowd) people mapping crises areas and it not being used by the local people for local planning.<p>All this doesn&#x27;t contradict what the article states. It&#x27;s even more important that these mapping projects are being used for local planning.

Nothing really happened for eight months as I worked on other projects in the Rust ecosystem. Out of the blue kvark contacted me wishing to collaborate. He has similar gripes to me with respect to graphics APIs, but unlike me he has had a large amount of experience in professional game development. It is thanks to him that we are where we are today.<p>We still have a long way to go towards making gfx-rs a polished and production ready. A great deal of the ugliness stems from us lacking a few key language features. Thankfully those are slated to be finished by Rust 1.0, so things will get better soon!<p>> Are you a game developer?<p>No, I&#x27;m a CS student who is interested in computer graphics and procedural generation. I come from an art and illustration background and my original goal for Rust was to generate my art[0] algorithmically in real-time. Unfortunately most of my time over the last couple of years has been spent helping to build up the Rust ecosystem to a stage where it is a viable choice for game developers.<p>> Why did you put so much work in such a huge project?<p>I could sit around battling with clunky tools like C++, but if everyone did that then nothing would change. Instead I have chosen to sacrifice some of my &#x27;project time&#x27; towards helping to make Rust look like a viable choice for my peers. I may struggle to ever finish my actual project, but if I can help other people create wonderful stuff in the future then I will consider my time well spent.<p>- [0]: <a href=""http://voyager3.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voyager3.tumblr.com/</a>",1416054213

Not to mention, the government coming in with the offer of national IDs (read: &quot;the better to start taxing you with!&quot;)<p>Slum politics and culture are never simple to explain as there are always many ways to effectively discuss them.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/09/google-and-microsoft-putting-rios-favelas-on-the-map/380826/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/09/google-and-microsoft-put...</a>",1416053837

I learned that code change the world not music and the web has become a part of our daily live and technologie evolved rapidly in the past years.<p>In august i came across an interesting peer 2 peer project called bem.tv on github and  after i digged a bit deeper i found out, its all made with javascript, therefore Nodejs , Angularjs and WebRTC are the new canditates for the realtime (mobile) web and APIs become the  currency in an opensource world.<p>I found one of the most sophisticated WebRTC APIs out there, which obviously disapeard shortly after i decidet to use it  and now i am looking for a co-founder , partner for a new startup to reestablish it as a fremium BaaS.<p>What i dont want - grow quick and exit<p>My goal is to find a dedicated team and boostrap everything from startup, without any money involved to create a product that people love. Remote work is possible.<p>What you need to have - You need to be able to reproduce complex structures and authentification with JWT, angularjs and rest APIs.<p>What i can offer -  100% commitment and passion to learn whats required,i have HTML skills and a great network and a vision.<p>Currently i am learning angularjs and play around with tools to create  APIs, like strongloop, swagger and apigee.<p>If you feel appealed with the discription and want to be part of a new beginning, feel free to contact me.<p>Mail: marc@let.de  phone: +4915773329231 Some example backend screenshots and API description at http://macbroadcast.org  all code is available on github.<p>Thanks for you attention<p>Looking forward to hear from you",1416053835

8611518,comment,8610704,8610704,0,0,jdswain,,,"I had this book at University. It made a good companion text to our main textbook, the dragon book. The dragon book covers a lot of ground, and is very interesting, but Holub&#x27;s book is much more practical, with everything illustrated with real code examples (if my memory is correct). This was a big help when learning and made compilers a lot more fun. It&#x27;s well worth reading.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that most of the content is still just as relevant today. Coding styles change over time, and definitely the popularity of languages has changed, but the theory is still just as useful.<p>Off topic, but we had the &#x27;International&#x27; edition of this book. Many publishers at the time did this, I&#x27;m not sure why. The explanation was that it was to make it more affordable for us, although the prices were still high. They were soft cover editions with plain covers (this book had a red cover with only the title and author, in white). The linked page is the first time I&#x27;ve seen the real cover. This is probably an early example of regional pricing, much like DVD region codes. They could charge more in USA and less in other territories I guess.",1416053530

The sugar here and there is nothing compared to the massive mental burden of OO, inheritance, compilation, DLLs, Visual Studio, etc etc etc.<p>Scheme, via SICP, is much easier to get started with, and one can learn the basics with that quickly (including getting much more comfortable with the sequence abstractions -called LINQ in .NET- than even the average .NET developer).<p>All these reasons are also why I greatly prefer F#.

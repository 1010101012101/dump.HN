34410,comment,34409,34409,0,0,queensnake,,,"Not relevant to the article but, I've got a piece of user interface I want to patent - sure patents are evil but the underlying tech is kind of easily deducible / re-creatable once seen (it's a human-aided optimization system, the method of human interaction is obviously on display). So I feel I need that protection to even show it to anyone. Again not too relevant but, does anyone have experience with protecting 'fragile' tech? ",1184559493

Clearly, sending a tractor back 1000 years would do wonders for local productivity. The boost from the marginal US tractor would be orders of magnitude smaller.<p>This is pretty obvious.<p>What isn't obvious is why the developing world grows so slowly in spite of the multitude of available improvements from the first world. The article mentions looking for 20% growth in some countries. Is that really a high number considering people in the US is 40X richer than Eritrea?\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP...</a><p>Increasing freedom is important here, clearly. Increased ease of communication must be playing a roll.<p>One thing I've never understood is why it seems people don't try to make much money off of the poorest 5B people. If you tap that market, the growth potential is ginormous. This reminds me of an excellent article about design for the world's poor.\n<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/science/29cheap.html?ex=1184904000&en=3c586de4efc78ca5&ei=5087"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/science/29cheap.html?ex=11...</a>",1184558576

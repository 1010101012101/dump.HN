In contrast, the tor network look at attributes such as up-time in order to shape and redirect traffic flows for improved performance. When the network is increased by 70% from newly created nodes, those new nodes only get a small portion of the overall traffic until they have had time to established themselves.<p>They do say later in the interview that they could had added the nodes slowly over time, but that sounds implausible with a bot network or one paid by stolen CC.

8812742,comment,8811305,8812546,0,0,scrollaway,,,"> many critics of veggie meat offerings complain that it doesn&#x27;t &quot;taste like meat&quot;, so they can&#x27;t eat it.<p>No, that&#x27;s not how it works. Most <i>taste</i> critics of veggie meat are that it doesn&#x27;t taste good <i>and</i> it doesn&#x27;t taste like meat, so isn&#x27;t a suitable replacement for it.<p>Fish doesn&#x27;t taste like meat, yet it&#x27;s ruddy delicious. But fish does not market itself as a drop-in replacement for, say, beef. Fish indeed would be a very poor drop-in replacement for beef and I&#x27;m fairly certain people would notice if their burger suddenly tasted like salmon.<p>I had a similar problem with bread during my keto diet. Everyone doing keto around me kept saying &quot;oh you can do this and that to make a low-carb bread and it&#x27;s a perfect replacement for it!&quot;. Well no, it&#x27;s bloody not. I&#x27;m french and have very high expectations for bread. &quot;Wiping your plate&quot; is not the main feature of bread in a dish.<p>I love meat (and as a sidenote, I love chicken tikka). I like some veggie &quot;meats&quot; (although I&#x27;ve tasted repugnant ones as well), but they don&#x27;t replace meat, I&#x27;m sorry. Just because they can take the place of meat in the diet of some does not make them suitable for it, and that is why people complain it doesn&#x27;t &quot;taste like meat&quot;. The complaint would not be about the taste if it weren&#x27;t there to replace something else.",1419901032

Anybody who&#x27;s ever bought a pack of gum in a Manhattan cigar store or asked for something to be stamped FRAGILE at a Chicago post office or tried to obtain a glass of water from a South Boston waitress knows well the soul-crushing effect of a service worker&#x27;s scowl, i.e. the humiliation and resentment of being denied the Professional Smile.</i>",1419900886

I&#x27;m glad the problems you listed are much smaller than they used to be, but none of them were solved with grassroots boycotts. Many of them went away due to changes in economic conditions and an expanding moral sphere.<p>And I was being realistic, not fatalistic. There are countless examples of people engaging in immoral behavior for better quality of life. Here are a few:<p>- Eating meat. It&#x27;s bad for the environment, not-that-great for one&#x27;s health, and visits immense suffering upon animals. But bacon tastes good, so people rationalize their behavior.<p>- Driving a gas car. It pollutes the environment, aids immoral regimes such as Saudi Arabia, and contributes to climate change. But again, they&#x27;re so convenient. Except for Tesla, electric cars are slow, small, and short range. The reason Tesla is an exception is because Elon Musk recognizes that, in order to be successful, electric cars must be better than gas cars.<p>- Pirating content. Piracy deprives artists of income and violates the principles of contract law. If you don&#x27;t like the cost or terms, then don&#x27;t consume the content.<p>- Not conserving resources (electricity, water, etc).<p>Some individuals do some of these things, but never civilization as a whole.

The tools necessary to increase housing supply in the face of rising demand have been available since the early 1900s—as discussed extensively here, in <i>The Rent is Too Damn High</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078XGJXO)—and"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0078XGJXO)—and</a> yet this endless series of articles doesn&#x27;t mention the obvious.<p>The solution to rising prices is to increase the supply of the good in question.

If your house goes up from $300k to $500k and your property tax rate is a typical 1.25% per year, then you made $200k for doing <i>absolutely nothing</i>, but you&#x27;re paying $2500 per year for it. If you don&#x27;t like it, sell your house and make a clean $200k (ok, slightly less due to transaction costs) and downsize or move.<p>What I would support is a law that allows retirees of low income to keep a locked-in property value, on the provision that the house <i>must</i> be offered for sale at that price upon the owner&#x27;s death (and can&#x27;t be handed down, though next of kin may bid on it).

The AR-10 (the parent of the AR-15 that used 7.62 NATO) was part of the &quot;competition&quot; that somehow ended up selecting the Army&#x27;s very own M14, through expedients like replacing screws and/or pins with coil springs while the rifles where in the custody of the Army.<p>An early limited use of the AR-15 in Vietnam produced outsized reports of <i>extreme</i> stopping power and lethality, explained by the very high velocity of the the 55 grain bullets of the time (3,250 fps in something I just looked up, which matches my memory).  From my research, before the civilians in the DoD forced it on the Army and Marines, mere wounding was never a selling point, that sounds more like excuses after real experiences showed how bad it really was.<p>SLAM was a fraud, his schedule could not have produced the data he claimed to have collected then, a scholar  reviewed his appointments calendar and noticed the discrepancy.  It appears he did a limited number of bullshitting sessions and pulled his results out of his ass.  Read e.g. the completely unrelated Hackworth <i>About Face</i> for a bit more on his feet of clay, in Vietnam.<p>My counterpoint to the soldier&#x27;s load argument is that the tradeoff went too far, e.g. I&#x27;ve read some accounts of SAW operators who <i>really</i> wished the round was more effective.  I submit there&#x27;s a case to be made for fewer but more effective rounds, but not battle rifle level.

Personally speaking, I&#x27;d be more interested if they had a more complicated technical methodology.<p>If they simulated assembly modules, or had a more intricate assembly system (Joints are... surprisingly complicated and intricate), I&#x27;d have found the article interesting. Otherwise, this was a very brute-force methodology to build a massive art piece.<p>For example, imagine if the Ark were built out of a metal skeleton simply welded together. The Skeleton could have been scanned in with a 3d scanner, and then a custom model built around the support.<p>The model could have then been a hollow-shell, simulated with FEA for structural integrity and then designed to be press-fit together (without glue).<p>Such a methodology could have been accomplished without using literally tons of plastic that this guy has done.<p>The way the article goes, it sounds like the frame was designed after-the-fact. Which is kinda surprising that they made this work at all without collapsing in on itself.",1419898105

8812578,comment,8809910,8809910,0,0,hunterloftis,,,"I&#x27;m the Node platform owner at Heroku.<p>Great timing on reliability questions - I just finished writing an incident report for Node! All apps were up, but about 44% of deploys failed for 1 hour on the 18th this month. That&#x27;s the only incident report I&#x27;ve had to do in the past six months:<p><a href=""https://status.heroku.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://status.heroku.com/</a><p>Our support team is amazing; we have several node devs on the front lines and anything they&#x27;re not sure about gets quickly escalated to me. One of my favorite things about Heroku is that all customers - paying or not - get real support from full-time staff with deep experience.<p>Heroku also works great with non-node apps, as you mentioned. We have hundreds of customers running PhantomJS and doing some pretty incredible things with it (like spinning up temporary dynos to walk their content and pre-generate server-side data for client-rendered single-page apps). PHP, Java, Ruby, etc are all first-class and with official buildpacks - plus, since a buildpack is a simple bash script, you can write one for just about anything:<p><a href=""https://github.com/hone/heroku-buildpack-jsnes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hone/heroku-buildpack-jsnes</a><p>The biggest reason I see folks hacking on less solid services is price. I think we could do a better job of making clear just how far you can go, for how cheap, on Heroku (I didn&#x27;t realize myself until I worked here). Unverified accounts can run 5 free apps... and verified accounts can run 100! Each app gets 750 free dyno hours each month (there&#x27;s only 744 hours in a month), and each dyno can handle really amazing throughput with node. To test for yourself, you can write a &#x27;hello world&#x27; app, add the free blitz:250 addon, and then slam the app with 250 concurrent users to see how it holds up with nearly a million requests an hour (hint: linear scale without a flinch). You get free rabbitmq, mongodb, postgres, redis, https, etc. All of Toyota Europe is run on node on Heroku, and they only use a couple of dynos per country.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll end this novel with the conclusion I came to after seeing how the sausage is made: Heroku grows with you. It starts free and becomes cheap once you&#x27;re pulling non-trivial traffic, and it surpasses everything else in terms of app (vs ops) focus. If you&#x27;d like to learn more, I&#x27;m happy to nerd out.<p>Cheers,\nHunter",1419898064

Europe always had a shortage of developers. They are also not markets where people from other countries can go and work.<p>So, that means all things being equal, when really good developers leave their countries they are depriving the local market of their talent.<p>If you think of the equation this way -- when engineers immigrate to the US they are bringing with them the investments that their own countries had made. Outside the US many countries subsidize higher education, especially engineering.<p>It used to be that the money that these engineers sent back would more than offset the local productivity gains.

I installed it to get around some particularly nauseating behavior of some sites long ago, and largely forgot about it and browsed blissfully unaware of how much it was helping.  Then I realized that someone else&#x27;s Pandora was playing ads, and mine wasn&#x27;t, it just plays song after song.  I felt rather bad about that.  This is a well established transactional structure which we are all used to on the radio, songs interspersed with the occasional ad to generate revenue.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been stealing from Pandora for a few months now, especially because I&#x27;ve been on the cusp of paying for it for a few months even without the ads.<p>Visual content with visual ads isn&#x27;t really that different, except that some sites vastly overshoot the expected norm for the ad-inconvenience to content ratio.

8812573,comment,8808152,8812487,0,0,pandaman,,,">But I saw studies to the opposite however.<p>Well, we are running in circles in here, are not we? These studies do not seem to be able to explain why the console DRM is not reducing sales. So you come with some other explanations instead of DRM. Which is something I expected because the whole premise seems very unnatural to me. Some intrusive and complicated DRM schemes might be able to affect sales negatively but there are just not that many people who have emotional reaction to DRM. I would not buy a game that required me to enter code from manual myself. I would not buy a game that depends on some central server verification. Not because I am religiously opposed to DRM but because it&#x27;s asking for too much of my attention. I am just fine with console games - they just work.<p>On the other hand, the PS2 modchips required 20+ wires soldering and expensive at the time DVD-R technology. A lot of people went for that. So, while there are some people who infringe just because it&#x27;s free, there are also people who infringe just because it&#x27;s somewhat cheaper. The later category is converted to paying customers with the DRM.",1419897973

I've worked on this problem briefly; my role was miniscule, but the basic idea is that you can encapsulate beta cells in an artificially immunologically privileged space, such as an alginate capsule.

Peer review and publication are specific contemporary terms used by professional scientists.

Forcing a user to fill out pages and pages of info isn't going to make them more loyal to your site, it just annoys them. It also won't stop spammers - they are just as creative as you are.<p>So let the user use your site (perhaps flagging changes such as comments as pending) but send them a link to authorize their site. Once they've done that, their changes go live and they can fill in the info you need of them. By doing an action (such as commenting), they have proven they are interested and they are much more likely to want to finish the registration process.<p>Edit: On second read-through, I see you might be talking about replacing a login with a URL permanently. I don't like this idea as much as it's a lot easier for me to remember my username/password than I am a unique URL (that's complex enough to not be easily guessable).

So your marginal utility is increasing.

It's like eating an ice cream. Maybe you have another ice cream and then another but at some point you're going to get sick. In Facebook's case, there's only so much Facebooking you can do before you start getting <i>bored</i>. Unless Facebook manage to keep launching new features, improving things to counteract this. And doing that is no easy task. As your user base grows, your software has to become even more and more addictive to compensate. I think there's more a problem with diminishing marginal utility with Facebook than there is with Amazon or Google or Apple or maybe even Twitter since the latter seem to serve a more direct, simpler, more basic need.",1277651022

459157,comment,458835,458835,0,0,giardini,,,"CS at CMU can be a crushing experience for even extremely bright students. I knew one. He chose to go into CS, but didn't realize that a large percentage of the other CS students were already hardened developers far more prepared than he was. He crashed and burned and almost lost his scholarship before moving to another degree plan. Today he's a programmer but his self-esteem is gone and he feels like he's faking it even though his work is good.<p>I chalk it up to the CMU CS experience. They should screen their CS students more carefully. It is extremely difficult for students (who tend to be idealistic and optimistic) to  anticipate how difficult the workload will be. It should be the university's responsibility to restrict class size or offer alternative preparatory classes for less-prepared students. ""Survival of the fittest"" may be great for the university but it's a tremendous waste of time and effort for many students.",1233370512

(The anal-retentive programmer in me doesn't like the vagueness in the method name.. what if there's a language called trim? :) but something along those lines makes sense. I remember reading that /php-trim-python was recommended for urls (vs php_trim_python or something). Is there a consensus on whether dir/ecto/ries are better or worse than hyphens?<p>The only thing I'm not sure about, is that I want to make sure the main user experience of looking up one function is as fast as possible. I thought it would be a bit faster to not have the search redirect to another page. On the other hand, google.com is obviously ""fast"", so maybe it doesn't matter too much.<p>I don't personally think it's a money maker, my general feeling is that programmers are too ""tech-savvy"" to click on many ads.

If you don't use them for something on a regular basis or have some regular verification process you may not know what you have until it's too late.<p>And, of course, I've also seen situations where subtle data corruption in the master database leads to weeks of subtly corrupt backups.

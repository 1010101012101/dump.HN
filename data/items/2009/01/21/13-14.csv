443200,comment,443048,443177,0,0,cmos,,,"This is creative, but the problem with clever 'backpay' solutions and startups is that often they are starved for cash, so the extra 5% or 10% is valuable money that they could be using to grow the business.<p>From an owner's perspective, I would never spend future revenue today.  What if your not making enough money to pay the bills, yet have to give a percentage of revenue to a developer?  They aren't going to stick around if things get tough.<p>It would be slightly safer to agree to a percentage of profit, but much better to just give a percentage of the company.  The same could be said for replacing the lower salary.  When you go to work for a startup there is a reason you get paid less: cash in the early stages is extraordinarily precious.  This can not be said loud enough.  I would not work for a company that didn't understand this.<p>It's a battle to start a company, and you really need everyone ""in the same boat"".

This extra could be 5% or 10% of the first year or two years' revenue but is not capped and so if the startup is very successful the developer could do quite well, but the founders have not sacrificed any long-term equity in their business.<p>I thought that was a nice way to give the developer a share of the business' success without actually giving up equity, and also without asking the developer to take a total risk that they could have wasted their time and never receive anything for it.",1232544687

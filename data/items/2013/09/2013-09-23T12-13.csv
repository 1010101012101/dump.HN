The company most likely spent >2 hours of staff time filtering resumes, & handling communications before issuing the code challenge.<p>If a fizzbuzz-order phone screen was done before the longer coding challenge, for multiple candidates, then most likely >> 2 hours.<p>What sucks though is when the hiring manager pretends (as managers often do) that the challenge will take &quot;only 2 hours&quot;, but in reality -- to get it production-grade, well-document, and (as happens quite often) provide fixes or workarounds to bugs in the hastily drawn up spec -- it ends  up taking 5-10 hours.<p>And as a reward, you get sent back to the internal recruiter, with their finite attention span and short-term memory capacity.

Modern UI designers need to implement a similar rule, if Cthulhu rises and decides to use your phone, or Vulcans land and click on your website, and they love it and feel you designed your product specifically for members of a horror mythos or space aliens, as a designer you&#x27;re probably doing something wrong unless you&#x27;re a hollywood sci fi prop designer.",1379941032

It&#x27;s considered the second safest metro in the country, after Mrida. The drug traffic violence worries everyone but is mostly confined to border states.<p>Education is complicated and very different from the USA. The local public elementary school that I walked past every day seemed to have literate students and attentive teachers working sincerely on education but there&#x27;s a scandal of unqualified teacher hiring and international test results from rural areas are depressing. The neighborhood I lived in was considered activist and organized so it may have been unrepresentative. The former leader of the national teacher&#x27;s union went to jail this year and the new president is working on reforms.<p>Free guaranteed schooling ends after eight years. Competitive testing puts a really large number of students into many different large but good public high schools with serious academic focus. Those who don&#x27;t pass or who want more personalized or specialized attention can find private high schools ranging from cheap to Manhattan prices.<p>Several nearly free universities comparable to good top-tier and second tier state schools in the USA also take many students based on exams. More expensive private schools are also available.<p>So if you train your kids right and play the game, quality education is very cheap.

I just made simple HTML, added my own Ajax Requests (before jQuery) and had a blazing fast web app without all the fake &#x27;state&#x27; that ASP.NET WebForms added.<p>Once MVC came around the corner, you basically get the Generic Hander + a way to properly structure your code.

I would agree that for a great many use cases there are potentially better and less costly tools than this stack, and as a .Net contractor by trade I&#x27;m (privately) one of its biggest critics.  But big (non-tech) businesses love Microsoft (rightly or wrongly), and as a result, in my local market i can provide for my family a lot better by staying put.<p>I appreciate the benefits of being at the cutting edge, but I feel there are hidden costs for some that aren&#x27;t obvious.",1379940586

If you&#x27;re going to demand that the candidate do some coding for you, at the very least give them a token amount of money in exchange for their time.<p>Yes, when you&#x27;re hiring a lot of people, the cost can add up, but you shouldn&#x27;t be demanding such a large slice of someone&#x27;s time without being prepared to compensate them fairly.",1379940565

Don&#x27;t forget that the first version of ASP came out in 1996. Bill Gates&#x27; &quot;Internet Tidal Wave&quot; memo was in May 1995.<p>At the time, Microsoft wanted a way to VB programmers onto the web, and still using familiar, easy tools. And staying inside the Microsoft mothership, of course. ASP grew into ASP.NET Webforms. (.Net 1.0 launched in 2002)<p>If one was familiar with VB or .Net and winforms, ASP and webforms wasn&#x27;t too much of a leap. But the abstraction was slow and leaky to work with, and the rendered html contained huge hidden state fields and other oddities. So a new generation of devs who grew up with the web generally greeted it with &quot;WTF!&quot;. That&#x27;s  where ASP MVC comes in.<p>IMHO the wheel has turned far since then; On windows 8, JavaScript is a language for developing desktop apps, so that web developers can try their hand at desktop - the reverse of the situation that Webforms set out to address.",1379940545

But you nailed it, we aren&#x27;t trying to be a large reseller and have hundreds of active designs, although I think donkey tees only has a small resale side now.  We were shooting more for a niche of some slightly off color, but mostly pop culture topics.  The idea was to only keep around 40-50 active designs for order, and to make them a better quality than most others.<p>I&#x27;d say its probably an easier road to be a reseller because you can pick designs that have a track record of selling and then just compete on price and service.  In our case we are trying to hit a harder target I think, not that the t-shirt business isn&#x27;t already crowded as hell anyway.  And I think a couple of people nailed it, we aren&#x27;t communicating clearly through our design about what we are doing and why it looks like we are charging more but really are the same price as others because we don&#x27;t have shipping charges in the US.<p>Thanks for taking time.",1379938954

We agree on that you don&#x27;t immediately need these tools if you are just starting out or write simple code, BUT I think it&#x27;s very easy to reach a point (I mean you are efficient enough in the technology itself) when you feel the need for these tools.
For example I&#x27;m not quite there yet, so I use SublimeText or an IDE but every time I edit a line I just hate these tools, because they feel so slow, and in that exact moment, when I won&#x27;t have to look up the manuals every time, because I don&#x27;t know the framework/language/technology I will switch to Vim for sure, because I think at that point when you are a <i>pro</i> in the technology, an IDE will get in your way. When you can crank out hundreds of lines without even blink, Vim is the way to go. Again, for beginners this is not the case. For casual coders? They probably do it for fun, so why not do cool things?
I cannot comment on Mercurial vs Git, because did not use Mercurial, I only read that with Git, you can do anything you want and with Mercurial, you can do most of the things simply.<p>TL; DR: There is a point in your knowledge about the technology when you simply NEED these tools.

While I know Google offers calculator functions, and unit of measurement conversions, I usually don&#x27;t know the exact format to use which will key the special functions.  Typically searching Google for &quot;percentage calculator&quot; or something similar takes you to a site with a clear UI and instruction.  Often times this is quicker than randomly entering searches into Google, hoping that my wording will spawn that special function.<p>So while yes, it&#x27;s scary/crazy to launch a web app that is so easily clonable for Google, the &quot;general use&quot; nature of Google means that they&#x27;ll never have these functions as prominent features.

People should have kids because they want to show them the world - as children they reasonably expect to love and cherish - not as some cynical insurance scheme.<p>> Why is that the employer&#x27;s fault?

If you can only do the latter, then it will just have to be less pretty.<p>The Old Google was the latter (very usable, not beautiful).<p>The New Google is the former (looks visually pleasing, very unintuitive to use).<p>I curse every time I compose an email now in Gmail.

Is ANYTHING gained AT ALL by HIDING all those buttons that are there to be used?<p>Heck, I still can&#x27;t tell you how to make a hyperlink. I think you have to mouse over the hidden buttons.

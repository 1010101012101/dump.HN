7926747,comment,7926493,7926493,5,0,shutupalready,,,"I&#x27;m going to offer the contrary advice that hiring by employee referral is not a good approach, for these reasons:<p>1. Your genius employee does not necessarily know lots of other geniuses. In fact, he might not know anybody. Yes, there are brilliant programmers and engineers who are well-connected, but there are ten times as many brilliant programmers and engineers who are solitary, independent types. If you press them for a referral, you&#x27;ll get a referral to his brother-in-law who took some computer courses or the guy that was nice to him in university but hasn&#x27;t found a job yet.<p>2. Friends hiring friends leads to cliques. For a startup, two or three friends working together is ideal. But for a larger enterprise, you want to avoid that. Of course, cliques will form by themselves, but why create them from day 1.<p>3. It&#x27;s very cynical to say this, but chances are that your employee is not going to recommend someone smarter or harder working than he is. Why make himself look bad? (One of Paul Graham&#x27;s articles says that this is true of mediocre programmers, but not of the top ones. Perhaps when you&#x27;re starting out, you want to work in a room full of geniuses, but what if you are the top dog in the room? Are you going to bring in someone that can obviously show you up?)<p>Many hiring methods lead to negative quality direction. Example: Making all your hires from Monster.com would be a negative trend. But a lot of people seem to believe that hiring based on employee referral is a positive. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not the worst way--and it&#x27;s probably much better than relying on Monster.com for instance--but I think that employee referrals lead to quality <i>loss</i> over time.",1403405820

Consequently, a common solution was to transport a young worker from Britain or a German state, who would work for several years to pay off the debt of their travel costs. During the indenture period the servants were not paid cash wages, but were provided with food, accommodation, clothing and training. The indenture document specified how many years the servant would be required to work, after which they would be free. Terms of indenture ranged from one to seven years with typical terms of four or five years&quot;",1403404903

They dont respond in an orderley manner and instead want people to clean their drivers and do all these things that MIGHT fix it. Not to mention this problem has been big since 2006.

Actually doing it, is. If you read the &quot;Call me maybe&quot; you&#x27;d see that most of supposed consistent databases fail.

Consistency for some data is the right choice, no argument there. At the same time they are _not_ throwing away or switching away from eventual consistency.<p>In fact they are the database that when preserving conflicted siblings actually did better than most in &quot;Call me maybe&quot; series. CouchDB is another database that does this right. It preserves merge conflicts explicitly during replication. Users can chose to ignore them but it doesn&#x27;t arbitrary throw data away. It is not in the series because replication and cluster topology is user defined and managed so there is no default, single distributed cluster setup.<p>Most of the failures of databases come from trying to sweep under the rug effects of conflicts in eventually consistency.

They use the service to connect with old friends and waste time; maybe meet new people too.<p>Younger people are exploring the medium trying to find new ways to express themselves.  A lot of what design snobs find bizarre comes from enthusiastic (and often impatient) experimentation.  ",1196570420

One of the weaknesses of some people in administration is that they want people around who look, act, and think like they do. That's a recipe for disaster.""<p>This is why so many startups hit a wall after they get picked up by corporate giants.  Group think kills.",1196569320

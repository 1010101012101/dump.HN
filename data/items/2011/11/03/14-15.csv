Clearly, Square users are younger and savvier than the general population.  No way should anyone use bank account-based payments on a mobile device that could be stolen/hacked/lost because you're not going to get the money back that is fradulently charged.<p>2) Do you really want to have a shopping experience where store cashiers and other customers standing around know your name?<p>Most people I know would prefer to remain more anonymous than that.<p>3) Where is the verification of customer payment (e.g. signature on CC receipt)?  What happens when there are customer chargebacks?<p>4) Is it really that hard to pull out and use a credit card?<p>I'm all for improving the current payments environment where a few major companies (Visa, MC, AMEX) dominate and as such, are able to extract large fees from merchants (which get passed along to consumers), but I don't see Square (or anyone else) as having found the answer yet.  Their attempts seem to be more ""cool to have"" and technologically impressive than actually solving the underlying inefficiencies in the payments industry.<p>And frankly, the major credit card companies are going to come out with their own NFC apps at some point and if Square is still relevant, they'll be just another player in the oligopoly (but still dependent on the others' back-end processing component).",1320331882

3191968,comment,3190738,3191778,1,0,alttag,,,"Even within the U.S., it's been my observation that the sort of embedded undercurrent of racism you seem to be addressing varies widely by geography and generation.<p>For example, I grew up on the Pacific coast and went to high school in the Seattle area. I didn't observe what I would call overt acts of racism (whether it was lack of awareness or lack of incidence is another argument). There were enough people of every ancestry possible that racism seemed like a silly idea.<p>Later (in my 20s)  I lived in and visited many places in the Rocky Mountain area. In many communities there was a significant population of Hispanics. Too often, they were poor, typically as a consequence of recent immigration (generationally) or education. However, the social environment was unfortunately such that it reinforced negative stereotypes. By this I mean that if the only people of another race you encounter on a daily basis were poor (and everyone successful looks like you), subconsciously your behavior with regard to that population will change. There aren't enough teachers and school leaders (for example) of Hispanic descent in areas with high Hispanic populations. Research shows that this is because those that go to college choose not to teach because the salaries put them in near poverty conditionssomething many are trying to escape via higher education.<p>(To this point, we in the U.S. have created self-reinforcing discriminatory environment years ago with segregation, which limited educational attainment to a large population. By doing so, policy and practice practically ensured poverty and its associated ills. We're getting over it, but it will take time. Moving large groups from poverty can take a couple of generations.)<p>In the South (I'm now in Georgia), I find that race is mostly an issue for those about 15 years older than methose that lived during times where discrimination was more overt. As we were house hunting, more than one well-meaning (but misguided) elderly person suggested the neighborhood had gone downhill since [$race] moved in.<p>The social conditions where we grow up matter. The presence or absence of successful people of different races matters. Geography (and local history) matters. The extent to which people have traveled or moved from where they grew up matters.",1320331493

We should be more interested in whether this will work, and why or why not.<p>Last summer, Hyperakt [1] crowd-funded a beautiful radial depiction of the 2010 World Cup brackets [2]. I paid $25 for a great poster [3], and now Deroy has a new fan.<p>That project worked for the same reason all Kickstarter projects work: if the project succeeds, users and producers exchange money for goods. If the market doesn't validate your project, consumers aren't committed to pay and producers don't reap any benefits. This is a great model for project planning and idea validation.<p>On the other hand, this project extracts consumer rents <i>immediately.</i> If Fabrizio doesn't hit the $220k goal [4], users only get an <i>option</i> to purchase a license for $100 minus their contribution. No repercussions for the producer--he gets paid regardless. This is fine for licensing an existing font, but it sucks for spec work or otherwise non-existent work.<p>I'm sure everyone has a few questions about the amount he's charging. [5] However, we should focus on how Kickstarter provides a consumer-friendly market while this project exists on a producer-friendly market. These are some great introductory economic concepts.<p>EDIT: actually, each market has its own benefits. With Kickstarter, you can obtain market validation for free (or cheap).

There are also key schools where a lot of startups seem to emanate from in the US, so by extension those schools are also influential.<p>You can't pretend these 'power' centres don't exist in the startup world and if you were to try and identify why this demographic anomaly exists, who would you ask?<p>Them.<p>The reason it's the same in business is because generally business owners end up networking with other business owners, like startups network with other startups, because they want feedback/help/discussion from their peers.<p>That's what a community is and that's why politicians and reporters will go talk to these people, precisely because they know what they're talking about.

Now I'm the first to admit that I'm not a lawyer etc. pp, I don't know shit about trademarks. And I certainly have not the slightest clue about US (Apple's home) laws and regulations.<p>But no, this is not something that makes sense under any regulation that mankind can have invented while sober people were in charge. An apple is a fruit. Period. Not a trademark. If you happen to grant a trademark for that name than that's unfortunate, but doesn't change the fact that this word has a meaning and will be used for that.<p>If you choose a specific image for your company you need to protect that logo. But this _doesn't_ include scaring little guys that happen to draw this common everyday thing in a totally different way for their totally different business. That's insane.<p>I kind of understand your point and fair enough: We should blame that trademark (and .. copyright) system every day, just because. But please, you cannot conflate these things. However broken the system(s) are, these cases don't make sense in any case. Compare the images. Think about the business involved.<p>Aluminum gadgets with distinct apple icon engraved vs. food shops serving apple based dishes and drinks using the word apple in their name / a drawing of an apple as their logo.<p>Out of spite? No, probably not. Totally unnecessary, even considering your point about broken markets and laws? But of course!

That is, if a user initiates it by clicking, dragging, OK-ing, etc., then all the old system interactions are still allowed. If you want to take a screenshot, of course you can so long as the user hits a keyboard combo to do it.</i><p>How would that work? How does the system determine that the user intended for this particular action to take screenshots of other applications' windows?",1320328975

Yet he doesn't even realize that ""the same way that being good at sports is celebrated today"" is extremely offensive coming from him. The only reason Black people excelled at sports was that there weren't many other options for making a great deal of money without a good education. A quick survey of black athletes will undoubtedly show that they weren't at the top elementary schools and high schools in their areas. When you don't have a solid education or any place to get one because of your socio-economic class you turn to other options for making money, namely sports or entertainment if you're ""good"" selling drugs and crime if you're ""bad.""  The comment itself is true but the idea that he can't understand the historical context of his proposition or the reason it isn't already the case is sad.",1320328915

Once the sandbox lockdown is complete, you won't be able to invent new techniques that require entitlements the gatekeeper hasn't thought of already.<p>The sandbox marks the end of the open system. Protecting users from malware is a noble goal, but I don't see sandboxing as an effective enough tool to justify the loss of freedom. iOS is still to this day being compromised with ease despite its massively locked-down design, and I don't see the cat-and-mouse game ending any time soon. In fact, the malware danger from email and web pages is FAR higher than that from shady apps.<p>The motivation for the app store is purely financial, of course, which means that over the coming years it's in their interests to command as much control as possible, even to the point of eliminating unsigned apps altogether once the app store ecosystem is mature enough (plus it will allow them to finally kill Flash off all Apple platforms for good, as well as hobble all competing browsers, and, well, pretty much any software they decide to compete with).

One of the main appeals of both iOS and the Mac is the availability of exclusive, high-quality apps.

""I think, however, that this is one of the increasingly frequent instances when the Nobel Committee is damagingly constrained by its tradition that a prize can't be shared between more than three individuals. The key papers recognised by this award were authored by two groups, each containing a dozen or so scientists. It would have been fairer, and would send a less distorted message about how this kind of science is actually done, if the award had been made collectively to all members of the two groups.""<p>More here:

If so, I think you're more interested in social status, and in relative wealth than in absolute wealth.<p>Let's just consider health care. One reason health care is so much more expensive now compared to the 1950's is the roughly 60 years of technical innovation that has happened since then. In 1950, there were still outbreaks of polio. Cancer was a far more certain death sentence. MRI's didn't exist. The birth control pill was not yet available. There was no dialysis. There was no laser surgery. Heart surgery was very primitive: there was no bypass surgery, no replacement of heart valves, and no pacemaker. By and large, people died of diseases that could be treated today, and many of those treatments are available today even to the poor and uninsured.

It is about the fact that people who bust their ass (including the mythical startup founder) mostly just get screwed, because as soon as they figure out how they can reap benefits, that option is taken from them by those who need that extra .005% because somehow it matters that they have $1.1 billion instead of $1.0 billion (both numbers that mean essentially enough money to do whatever you want for the rest of your life, and the lives of your great grandkids too). It is about the fact that they paid taxes and built the infrastructure that is now being taken from them, in place of some privatized bullshit that they must re-pay for, because they can't buy laws to protect themselves. It is that they face imprisonment for attempting to come up with different business plans and attempting to play by new rules, while those who have giant companies can do what they want and hide behind liability sheilds, wherein there is no punishment for changing the rules for anything.<p>But sure, startups will cure everything because ""duh startups are magic unicorn poop that always disrupt everything and never ever fail 90% of the time"".",1317757985

For an application where you have significant CPU work, a simple worker pool (not coded by you), with an accept loop<p>while (s=accept()) { dispatchToWorkerPool(s) }<p>And an application-programmer method handleConnection(s) is pretty darned simple.  Just do blocking I/O from your threads and rely on the machine to swap in and out appropriately.<p>For the next level, you can have an evented i/o layer that passes sets of buffers back and forth to your worker pool.  That's more complex but still spares application programmers from having to worry about either eventing or threads, they just worry about passing back the right bytes.<p>Here's where things get interesting, though.  It turns out someone studied this (in Java) and actually found that stupidly throwing 1k threads at the problem with blocking i/o performed better than a clever nonblocking server, due to linux 2.6's threading and context-switching improvements.<p><a href=""http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mailinator.com/tymaPaulMultithreaded.pdf</a><p>Some of that might be specific to Java's integration with linux, but think about it..  the linux guys did a pretty good job at getting the right thread to wake up and assigning it to runnable state.

3072516,comment,3070094,3070660,3,0,notahacker,,,"There's a happy medium achievable between the straightforward blunt instrument of cash payments and systems whose targeting is so complex nobody understands their costs or benefits.<p>I'm unconvinced by neoclassical arguments by Friedman et al. on ""distorting"" for two reasons. 
Firstly there's nothing <i>inherently</i> wrong with introducing further ""distortion"" into the market unless you subscribe to the evidently false proposition that <i>no</i> person's ability to optimise their spending habits with respect to their budget constraint can be improved upon; that you're making individuals and society worse off for buying them healthcare when they expressed more interest in a hire-purchase agreement for a state-of-the-art pickup truck. I believe quite the opposite: people receiving government money <i>aren't</i> entitled to spend it on anything they want, and even with imperfect information a technocrat, will often be better at allocating some of that cash than the average welfare recipient.<p>Secondly, given differences between incomes, propensities to consume and the ease of introducing new supply into the market, a simple flat subsidy can distort markets more than targeted payments. Converting payments such as government funded health insurance to cash would have the effect of inflating the prices of ramen and particularly crappy apartments (since welfare recipients can live without the health insurance, albeit for less long, and there's not enough decent apartments in many areas). Given the relatively fixed supply of housing, people who already owned rental property would capture more benefit than any other industry, ironically <i>because</i> they chose to use their capital in a relatively unproductive manner.  On the other hand, hospitals might be worse off, losing part of their customer base and seeing cost increases (notably unskilled labour). Since the government has the choice in how they distort the market, I'd rather they subsidise healthcare professionals than slum landlords.<p>I totally agree with your point about bare minimum safety nets encouraging innovation. Even those poor who are never going to launch world-changing startups might consider a stab at freelancing in an area they're more capable in than dishwashing once the risk of not having regular income is removed.",1317756784

This is even more annoying, because there is a 'home' tag in Maps, but it doesn't get searched on.

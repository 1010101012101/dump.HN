They provide a service that is fairly obvious when you worked with Paypal or a large bank. The point is providing the service is a lot of hard work, thats what we pay them for.

There's a version of Octave now. And I'm sure there's more besides. There are definitely development options on an Android device.<p>I've been using SL4A and the Jota editor to teach myself Python (professionally, I'm a .Net developer) on my Nexus 7 and I've been pretty happy with it. I can carry it everywhere, and anytime I have a few minutes to spare I can open up the ebook I've been reading, then go to the editor and/or the immediate window and try some things out. And if I'm at my desk, I can use a hardware keyboard, making things even easier.<p>Emacs improves the possibilities even more. At the very least, it's a far better editor than any of the current editors (unless you're a vim fan using Terminal IDE) for any scenario where you need an editor.<p>At best, it could get a whole package management system of supporting utilities that are available to it inside its terminal, and becomes a good way to develop with virtually any language that has a compiler that can be ported to Android. Maybe it even gets w3m browser mode, music player mode, and other awesome Emacs-as-OS features.",1344967083

OMG, this site is pirating my content!\n2. I didn't want people to lend to anyone, just their friends and family<p>Case #1 is clearly an issue of authors being misinformed or technologically unsophisticated.<p>Case #2 is that authors probably thought that they were buying into a particular scenario, but the technology did not actually serve that scenario. The scenario I'm guessing the second camp thought they were buying into was one where lending would actually not be widespread --- where one would have to personally know someone in order to read a book without purchasing. It didn't limit who could be lent to by forcing users to declare ""friends and family"". I'm guessing that authors felt that LendInk was increasing the amount of lends actually happening above what would have happened had LendInk not been present.<p>Note: I'm not passing judgement on LendInk.

4382177,comment,4377181,4378170,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Ceol is right. I know Reddit is HUGE and is comprised of many different subreddits and today's Reddit is astronomically different from what it was 3 years ago when I left. But many male Redditors have deep seeded misogyny and they're in denial. Because of their aggressiveness their attitude used to affect a lot of site, NOT just their subreddit. I've seen female OPs ridiculed and downvoted off the front page while male OPs with the same conversation & stance would get upvoted. This is especially true for cheat stories, relationship problems, and male POV vs female POV style posts.<p>Remember when Bioware writer Jennifer Hepler got ganged up on by internet users and threatened with death and rape, called on her home phone and harassed, because of something she said about games 5 years earlier? That was Reddit's gaming forum. They ganged up on her because they felt Mass Effect 2 was apparently written wrong and she was the plague and scum that did it. That's just a tiny little fraction of the sexist shit Redditors can conjure up.<p>Back when I was a Reddit addict I'd see so many sexist posts. Not questionably sexist. Evidently sexist. When men would post ""my girlfriend cheated on me"" stories the Redditors would upvote and comfort the guy, give him their complete emotional support. They'd upvote the cheat stories to the front page when it was a man being cheated on. When it was a woman.... Naturally, Redditors would sympathize with the cheating boyfriend and ask the female OP if she did anything wrong. Revenge stories about men getting back at women were loved and would spend DAYS being on the front page from all the upvotes. Male Redditors would chime in with instructions on how to get the best revenge.<p>Anytime a woman would ask about what to do about her cheating boyfriend, they'd reply with ""talk to him about it"" and ""maybe its something that you did"". So sympathizing with rapists and blaming the victim is just up their alley.<p>And don't get me started on the Mens Rights subreddit whose posts would spill over onto the front page every other day. Those guys were drowning in their own testosterone. It's like they were angry that they're slaves to pussy, but rather than blame nature or themselves (their balls) they just blamed women for their problems. Don't know if it got better or worst, I'd rather not visit the subreddit at all.<p>After achieving mainstream popularity a few years ago the front page is now all memes and cats and all that sexist nonsense is isolated to it's subreddit. I would consider the memes the lesser of two evils.",1344966857

What visitors see on Social Teeth are messages created by political underdogs, everyday people, and grassroots organizations. Voting will determine which 5 campaigns will be first up for crowd-funded access to the national airwaves.<p>Social Teeths partner is Aegis Media, the #1 Ranked Media Network by RECMA Media Agencies Benchmark.  Aegis will provide professional media planning and purchasing services to Social Teeth campaigners. They will then be part of a political experiment that will give grassroots voices unprecedented access to mass media channels, and unheard-of clout in the national conversation.<p>We might not literally match the financial firepower of Super-PACs or coorporate lobbyists, founder Elaine Chang believes, but even running one national TV campaign gives citizens the very real payoff of getting their voices heard. And more citizen voices will lead to more relevant conversations. Since many of the issues that Social Teeth ads target are under-discussed in the current, personality-focused election, these ads could have the power to alter what candidates focus on.<p>Social Teeth gives a bigger bite to already trending social media. In order to upload an advertisement to the site, ads will have to have at least 1,000 likes on Facebook; Tweets, or notes on Tumblr. Then, Aegis Media and a kickstarter-esque donation system gives the message the final boost it needs to make it onto the national scene, whether on TV, radio, or in print.<p>Social Teeth, developed by a team of Stanford Alumni, is advised by Steve Hilton, Senior Advisor to British Prime Minister David Cameron who is currently on sabbatical at Stanford.

From Coding Horror [1] an example:<p><pre><code>    '*************************************************\n    ' Name: CopyString\n    '\n    ' Purpose: This routine copies a string from the source\n    ' string (source) to the target string (target).\n    '\n    ' Algorithm: It gets the length of ""source"" and then copies each\n    ' character, one at a time, into ""target"". It uses\n    ' the loop index as an array index into both ""source""\n    ' and ""target"" and increments the loop/array index\n    ' after each character is copied.\n    '\n    ' Inputs: input The string to be copied\n    '\n    ' Outputs: output The string to receive the copy of ""input""\n    '\n    ' Interface Assumptions: None\n    '\n    ' Modification History: None\n    '\n    ' Author: Dwight K. Coder\n    ' Date Created: 10/1/04\n    ' Phone: (555) 222-2255\n    ' SSN: 111-22-3333\n    ' Eye Color: Green\n    ' Maiden Name: None\n    ' Blood Type: AB-\n    ' Mother's Maiden Name: None\n    ' Favorite Car: Pontiac Aztek\n    ' Personalized License Plate: ""Tek-ie""\n    '*************************************************\n</code></pre>\nNow imagine something like this exists for <i>every</i> function and you're reading the source code... Annoying.<p>Others are less extreme of course, but repeating the code in comments is bad and even harmful if you forget to update the comment as well as the code.

One nice thing about Subversion's branching model is that it is relatively easy to merge single revisions from one branch to another and have that information be recorded in merge metadata.  In Git or Mercurial, you can cherry pick revisions by essentially duplicating them in a new location in the graph of revisions.  This is annoying in scenarios like this:<p><pre><code>       c--d--e\n      /\n  a--b\n      \\n       f\n</code></pre>\nNow we want the change from commit d applied on the branch with head f so we cherry-pick the revision into place.

Subversion won't make this mistake because when revision d will already be marked as merged into that branch.<p>I'm much happier with the DAG model of Git and Mercurial than I was with the Subversion branching model, but the DAG model is not universally superior.",1344963601

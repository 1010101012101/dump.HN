8640866,comment,8613855,8621576,0,0,wpietri,,,"As a person who was also once a teenager with testosterone, puberty, loneliness, etc, I disagree on a few points.<p>First, I disagree that the loneliness, etc, doesn&#x27;t have a lot to do with our culture&#x27;s construction of masculinity. There&#x27;s a lot of stuff that boys are &quot;supposed&quot; to be that plays into that. We&#x27;re supposed to be tough, macho, and unfeeling, so we don&#x27;t get much support for expressing or managing those emotions. We&#x27;re supposed to &quot;win&quot;, to be dominant, to be high status, with no help if we don&#x27;t. We&#x27;re not supposed to talk about the details of social interaction the way that girls do, so it&#x27;s always more mysterious. We are discouraged from building social and emotional support networks. And there&#x27;s a whole host more. It has taken me literally decades to start seeing how poisonous so much of that early gender programming was for me.<p>Second, I disagree that having been through it once makes you such an authority that you get to tell everybody else to shut up. Fishes undeniably understand water. But so do chemistry professors and hydrodynamicists. There are different ways to understand something.<p>Third, I disagree Anita and David Futurelle and I &quot;don&#x27;t start to understand&quot;. I think I understand my past as well as you understand yours. I&#x27;m sure David feels the same way about his past.  Both Futurelle and I have also spent years examining the mechanisms of gender culture. And for us, Anita&#x27;s point is accurate. Which is unsurprising to me, because she literally has a degree in this stuff. Her Master&#x27;s thesis was on gender representations in SF&F TV.<p>Now that doesn&#x27;t mean she (or anybody) is automatically right. But she does have standing to talk.",1416571189

8640862,comment,8639317,8640826,0,0,badgersandjam,,,"That sounds like an excuse which I don&#x27;t accept. I have a formal engineering background and whilst you&#x27;re fundamentally right, engineering is based upon cumulative experience gained. We have <i>a hell of a lot</i> of experience as a society of writing software that works and is of merchantable quality.<p>What the general state of affairs shows is the following traits:<p>1) There is no thought and research going into the design of a piece of software. Ergo, we do not learn from past mistakes.<p>2) There are isolated individuals writing vast swathes of software which are trusted unconditionally. Ergo, we do not learn the benefit of multiple eyes on a problem, review and discussion.<p>3) We assume that software is correct from one person&#x27;s viewpoint and opinion. Ergo, we do not test software properly nor cover those tests with objectives.<p>4) We work to deadlines, not quality objectives. Ergo, we trade quality for tolerance from others.<p>In this case someone came along and didn&#x27;t think about the problem, didn&#x27;t work with others, assumed they were unconditionally correct and chose tolerance over quality.<p>To use your analogy, they&#x27;re now selling stainless steel lightning rods (poor conductivity), are the only vendor of them, are a vocal marketing front and houses are catching fire everywhere.<p>Or more specifically, in one example, the entire process was above and from the author to the distributor, no one even noticed that loginctl doesn&#x27;t work properly.",1416571135

The problem is that this isn&#x27;t &#x27;usage-based&#x27;, because the only thing that has changed from the previous billing is a over-priced fee tacked on for people who go over the cap.

For most of history, &quot;infinitely expanding people wants&quot; was not a thing, at least in terms of material wants. Maybe because it was not believed to be possible? But there are plenty of examples of autocratic rulers in pre-industrial times who extracted less resources from their subjects than it&#x27;s believed they could. So, did they balance that against some risk or the effort required? Or were they simply uninterested in maximizing their personal wealth beyond a point? I feel even in modern capitalist society, above a certain threshold (which varies from person to person and according to circumstances) people are more motivated by status and recognition than material wants...<p>> If the robots that do all our work for us need to be as smart as us to do so, then they probably wouldn&#x27;t be willing to work for free.<p>Does being as smart as us require being as self-aware as us? Does it require free will? Does it beget human needs and values? If 000, my scenario holds. If 100, we might be faced with a serious moral dilemma. If 110, who knows what our relationship with such beings would be. If 111, I&#x27;ve re-invented slavery and it should be abolished again at once, but I sort of doubt the answer to all three questions will be true.

You seem to have an idea that there are universal software development practices that are so well understood we can make regulation around them. But that isn&#x27;t how software works. There are some practices that are known and some that are unknown. For working software &quot;engineers&quot;, we are all, daily, put into a position for having to figure out for ourselves even what tools and materials to use to make anything.<p>Imagine you were an architect of buildings. Your day to day job is to design mundane strip malls and gas stations. You have building code on your side for much of the process. As long as you don&#x27;t violate the regulation, you at worst can only make an inconvenient building, but not a dangerous one.<p>But imagine instead that you&#x27;re building a large office building every six months, your clients demand you don&#x27;t reuse any design principles on your future clients, and you not only lacked the building code, but also 1/4th of the heavy machine equipment, 1/2ths of the tools, and 3/4ths of the raw materials. I don&#x27;t just mean you don&#x27;t have them in stock, I mean nobody has invented them yet. And of the ones that have been invented, we don&#x27;t even know all of their material properties, say nothing about what material properties we should be looking for. Will this particular bolt we are using with these particular cross beams hold up to the stresses placed on them? The answer is unknown, and I&#x27;m some cases unknowable.<p>It&#x27;s really easy as a user to say, &quot;they should have tested this more&quot;. While strictly true that more testing <i>may</i> have found your issues ahead of time (presuming the right tests were done), it is <i>inefficient</i> engineering to exhaustively test things. Even mechanical engineering bases a lot on statistical modeling, which will always, always have corner cases that don&#x27;t match reality.<p>In the real world, people had to learn the hard way about things like lightning rods and sacrificial electrodes. They didn&#x27;t come about from &quot;testing during development&quot;. They came about from testing live, and seeing which buildings and boats did or did not burn down or sink. That&#x27;s not bad engineering. That&#x27;s just the nature of unknown problems.",1416569868

Villagers who are librarians may trade an emerald for a 20-something sheets of paper. Paper is crafted from sugar cane.

In general I strongly recommended to write assembly functions which follow the platform&#x27;s ABI (I&#x27;m a TA for a course using assembly programming). At the very least, function calls and returning values should be consistent and function calls shouldn&#x27;t have this kind of side effects. In this case<p>* calculateStrLength effectively leaks stack space because it pushes the input string and doesn&#x27;t balance the stack before returning - this is why the return value is passed using rdi. At least the return value pushed by call could have been preserved in calculateStrLength itself. It also increments the size counter without resetting it (it&#x27;s reset to 0 in _start) which is a bit of a weird choice.<p>* then reverseStr (which is not a function but just a label in _start) pops the string off the stack and copies it to the OUTPUT buffer (but doesn&#x27;t copy an end of string NULL character - which works because the buffer is in the bss section, but it&#x27;s not a good practice). The return address pushed by the call to calculateStrLength is left on the stack.<p>The whole thing is designed pretty weirdly because reversing a string is trivial to do in place (or with just an input and output buffer), there&#x27;s no need to use the stack.",1416568858

How do other companies handle it?<p>----<p>I thought there would not be any issues when I just don&#x27;t sell to the US, but during the preparations of founding a small company to sell my work I learned, that we have software patents in the EU and with this in Germany.

Looking at cases in the US I think it is just a matter of time, till we get those cases in the EU/Germany. Still down the road and not very likely, but I&#x27;m very risk-averse so I got out. (You cannot insure yourself against patent claims and a German GmbH (compare Limited in UK) doesn&#x27;t protect you personally in such cases.)<p>That said, maybe open source is an option, but I&#x27;m not completey sure about patent claims there.

Obviously, there are lots of cases where that simply isn&#x27;t necessary - and nobody likes to take on unnecessary equity holders if they don&#x27;t need the money.<p>But if you do need the money, it&#x27;s not a surprise this comes at a cost. People who invest in companies want to make sure those companies have a decent shot at succeeding. The vesting scheme is designed to incentivize founders to keep working on their company, and if that looks very similar to vesting schemes early employees get that&#x27;s not an accident.<p>The same goes for your more general criticism of SV as a location. There are startups where this is simply not relevant. Nobody wants to move their life and business to another (more expensive) location if they don&#x27;t expect it to be better there. But for a certain type of startup, the expectation that SV is better than any other part of the world is absolutely justified.<p>Everything is a tradeoff. It makes sense to evaluate these tradeoffs carefully. Money has a cost. Optimizing your opportunities (usually) has a cost. Sometimes you need investors to succeed, sometimes you don&#x27;t.<p>To put it bluntly, if I can become the next Facebook while sitting in my garage in Vladivostok not talking to anybody, there is absolutely no reason to move to Silicon Valley and give away most of my company.

31675,comment,31523,31639,0,0,edw519,,,"""99% of the time, all of your equity is going to add up to nothing""<p>I think that's true no matter how many co-founders you have.<p>""Jealously guarding your equity when it's worth nothing seems silly to me.""<p>Sorry you see it that way.  I'd gladly accelerate my business with the right partners.  In the meantime, I'll just keep on coding and selling until I find the right co-founder(s).  Nothing jealous about it.",1183159309
31674,comment,31523,31637,0,0,edw519,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  This list was made partially in jest, but 100% from experience.<p>In my first startup with 3 co-founders, I wasted (yes, wasted!) 50% of my time on numbers 9 and 10.  It got so bad, I was afraid of what our customers would witness.  And these were seasoned business people in their 20's, 30's and 40's.<p>8. Good point.<p>7. I disagree.  I am still stunned at what I can accomplish with today's tools vs. 10 years ago.  With time and money.  And the more I code, the better I get.  Every new project I write takes half the code of the previous one.<p>6.  Really disagree.  My experience is that the provider of the advice THANKS ME for the opportunity to advise.  There are people out there dying for the opportunity to mentor for free; they just don't find many chances.  Their payback is watching you succeed with their advice.  They can't buy that.<p>4.  I hate this one.  I really do.  People come to me looking to invest and then tell me my biggest problem is that I may get hit by a bus.  Funny thing, I have never had a customer bring this one up.  The next time I hear the bus remark, I'll just jump out a 6 story window.  That'll show them.<p>3.  Leave my cat out of it.<p>1.  First start-up alone.  We'll see.  We'll see.",1183158557

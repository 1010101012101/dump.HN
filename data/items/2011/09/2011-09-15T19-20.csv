3001876,comment,3000287,3000980,3,0,bwanab,,,"There's truth in what you say and boomers in general have to take responsibility for having close to zero foresight with respect to how they've squandered their fortunes but let me counter a couple of your points.
1. The vast majority of boomers hit the job market between the middle 70's and middle 80's. This was the worst job market between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. While many things were peachy during boomer's youth, reality bit pretty hard for a really long stretch of time.
2. Reagan was largely voted in by the boomer's parent's generation.
3. And yes, under a boomer government, the housing market, stock market, global economy tanked, but I'm hard pressed to believe that these results didn't hit the boomers as hard or harder than they have hit the following generations.",1316116760

Their ratings system was really unreliable for me, so finding quality was difficult. On the other hand, when I heard about films by word of mouth, and found them on Netflix, I really ended up enjoying them.<p>I always found that Dish Network had a really reliable content rating system--it was an objective star system not based on user preferences. Some combination of this with tailoring to individual users might be the best fit for Netflix--it would help users find content, but it would also provide an objective measure that lets me validate the 'users like me' rating system the use now. If Netflix had a better algorithm/system for helping find content, and a dash of Hipmunk UI, then I'd still be a customer.",1316116688

If you have subtle differences between libraries on different machines you should fix that rather than recompiling your code on each one.  Removing the compiler isn't less secure, and since they are the ones making the rules you have to follow them.  It should also dramatically speed up your deployments when you don't have to rebuild on each machine.<p>I would recommend that you don't do things just because that's how you were taught 15 years ago.  There are probably some things that haven't changed since then, but so many things are different.

(I'd argue that that development model's a poor fit for the web, but that's a different question.)<p>If we really did that, we'd be back in the land of HTML4 and CSS2.1 and, ironically, Flash and Java applets.<p>I think the reality for most projects today is that we make a decision about how much portability pain we're willing to accept in return for using newer technologies to alleviate other pain such as making yet another set of rounded corner graphics, and we make a decision about how much degradation in the user experience is acceptable for older browsers that don't support whatever non-portable technologies we choose to adopt.<p>This is a far cry from what web standards should be, of course.<p>> That is an artifact of ClearType subpixel positioning.<p>That may be so, but the fact is that for several months lots of people using Firefox will have had difficulty reading lots of sites that worked perfectly well in older versions of Firefox and still work perfectly well today in other browsers (which makes me very suspicious of pinning the blame entirely on ClearType, BTW; no other software on these PCs has any trouble displaying those fonts).<p>If you're going to cause that kind of regression, then IMHO a policy of trying to force all of your users to update continually and ignoring the needs of those who can't or won't is inappropriate. Particularly in a security-sensitive application like a web browser, I think forcing users to choose between recent versions with vulnerabilities patched or old versions that actually did their job properly is irresponsible. After all, isn't this one of the reasons plug-ins are supposed to be Very Bad Things?<p>> I have a feeling you're choosing the font incorrectly.<p>Given that there is no standard specification of how to choose fonts like this, I think that's perhaps a rather bold claim to make (no pun intended). (Go ahead, check any W3C recommendations you like, you won't find it. In fact, the CSS2.1 Recommendation specifically acknowledges the variations in things like font weights between different families. It also provides no specific advice on naming conventions for font families at all, because what would you say that makes sense anyway?)<p>Again, it doesn't really matter though, because the point is that <i>it worked on every other browser</i>. Whether they are tolerant and Firefox is correct or they are correct and Firefox is broken doesn't change the end result.<p>> That's because most downloadable fonts aren't hinted for ClearType. DirectWrite with its subpixel positioning can cope much better with unhinted fonts.<p>Sure, but hundreds of millions of people are still browsing with ClearType, so I think trying to get professional sites to use web fonts that look rubbish in comparison to tried-and-tested screen-optimised fonts like Georgia and Verdana is one of those ""Oooooh, shiny"" policies that is more driven by hype than substance.<p>And for the record, a lot of the fonts available on the commercial font rental services render poorly even on high-resolution screens using the latest browser versions on Windows 7. I suspect the font services and foundries are banking on higher-res screens of the kind we're seeing on the latest smartphones making the need for traditional screen-font hinting obsolete. But this is drifting off-topic so I won't follow that avenue any further.",1316115234

There is no ""official"" Android or iOS support from Nokia / QT for instance.<p>I've deployed ASP.NET MVC apps on Linux / Mono and it was a relatively painless experience. The desktop and RIA guys in .NET land are doing their own thing with WPF and Silverlight (google MVVM / Caliburn-Micro), and frankly, it's freaking me out a bit. There's a tendency to overengineer and abstract everything. It might not be as bad as with Java but the tendency is still there.<p>For instance, the .NET community has been arguing for years about domain driven design and how you should abstract away (or not!) database access. Hundreds of blog posts about which application layer should be concerned with this and that, about generic data access repositories, enhanced query objects and so on. What was ""the way to go"" one day was suddenly ""the new singleton"". Some guys eventually came up with the glorious ""CQRS"" approach (inspired by Betrand Meyer's command query separation) and built entire frameworks such as NCQRS with separate read/write stores, event sourcing and audit trails. The problem is that a lot of people start to use these enterprise models in very simple applications.<p>I'd also say that the 3 mentioned languages are, in their current incarnations, very different from each other.

I started out by editing live PHP files on a shared server from A Small Orange ($3.33 a month!).  After a few months I a few apps with traffic around 30k DAU.  A Small Orange would automatically shutdown the apps every couple hours.  I'd email them and complain about their shoddy hosting service.  They'd always respond instantly apologizing and putting the apps back online.  After a couple weeks I realized that I had a scaling problem and began learning how to setup a dedicated server.  Over the next two years I spent about 80% of my time wrestling with hardware, setting up load balancers, configuring cache and db servers, and other operational nightmares.  I had little time or energy to work on improving my apps or building new products.<p>Then I discovered Heroku.  I would have done anything to have this when I started out.  The platform teaches (forces) you how to build a scalable architecture.  You can try out new ideas for apps for essentially nothing (1 dyno is zero dollars).  Since moving to Heroku I spend about 5% of my time working ops.  The craziest thing is I've actually saved money since switching from dedicated hardware to Heroku.  I was really bad at configuring servers and the stuff I built was inefficient and expensive.  Heroku's cloud stacks are optimized better than my old hardware environment.<p>Heroku's architecture is great for wild traffic swings common with Facebook apps.  Well except for their database services.  They don't seem reliable or scalable.  I prefer RDS.<p>In sum, Facebook and Heroku is a great starting place for learning to build web apps.

I'm constantly blown away by the improvements in developer efficiently being made seemingly every day right now. This is why you are seeing a ton of startups (even the well funded ones) only hiring a small focused technical team. What is rather funny is watching how fragmented the mobile development space has become, with some exceptions (PhoneGap, SpacePort, Mobify, etc.), especially considering that is where people are moving so rapidly to do their computing.

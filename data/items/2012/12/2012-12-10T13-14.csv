4898968,comment,4898489,4898489,1,0,Kaivo,,,"It's indeed very motivating to read/hear such things. Still, there is always this underlying fear of failure that stays present, and this fear is somehow difficult to overcome. After all, of all the dreams people have, of all the people working their way toward their dreams, how many are actually succeeding? We can't really deny that for some case, regardless of the effort put together, it can/will still fail.<p>From this fear, the rest kind of snowball; you are afraid to fail, therefore you do all you can to not fail, you stay realistic about the situation, you even expect failures [1]. I do find all this very inspirational, but also difficult to apply altogether when in a realistic or even negative state of mind. The first smallest failure will be a reason to give up, to lose motivation.<p>The points mentioned by Will Smith in the video the author linked could be applied one at the time to eventually reach a point where these fears can be put aside, almost forgotten, and all the rest could follow, slowly built by placing one brick at the time.<p>Maybe the thoughts are mixed up, or I don't understand it the way the author meant to explain it, but I see that those two HN threads are linked, but almost opposite. Will Smith states that having a Plan B distracts us from Plan A. Expecting failure ahead is preparing those Plan B.<p>[1]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4897467"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4897467</a>",1355147894

Like, for example, I tend not to put + instead of ++ in C++, so I can be pretty confident my code is free of these types of errors.

Or is there an implicit assumption that he needs to own the cables to get the deals?  What scale does he want to start on?  A small town/city or national?<p>I didn't see the original question while it was active but if I did I would have pointed out how hard such a business is to break into especially if top grade content is required due to the maze of exclusivity contracts and the value of them which means massive amounts of money are needed to make the sellers choose non-exclusive options.  Even companies like Microsoft and Sony with massive deployed platforms (Xbox and PS3 in particular) need prolonged negotiations to get any content and aren't anywhere near being able to offer full cable replacements and even with their own content Sony can offer only what is not exclusively licensed elsewhere.<p>However that doesn't mean that the video space can't be attacked as Netflix is showing but it will in my view need to be an indirect attack that builds audience until it can compete head to head for the major deals and content as a viable distribution platform and pricing model.

A good example is the recent work (award-winning at NIPS 2012) on sum-product networks, which are graphical models whose partition function is tractable by construction. Several important things have been added since 2006 (when deep learning was deemed to begin) to the previous wave of neural networks research, in particular powerful unsupervised learning algorithms (which allow very successful semi-supervised and transfer learning - 2 competitions won in 2011), often incorporating advanced probabilistic models with latent variables, a better understanding (although much more remains to be done) of the optimization difficulty of training gradient-based systems through many composed non-linearities, and other improvements to regularize better (such as the recent dropouts) and to rationally and efficiently select hyper-parameters (random sampling and Bayesian optimization). It is also true that sheer improvements in computing power and amounts of training data are in part responsible for the impressively good results recently obtained in speech recognition (see recent New York Times article, 24 nov, J.

Remember that boilerplate code does have meaning, and it counts. If you can't make time for reviews, then don't rubber stamp, just don't review.<p>2. Run whatever automation and analysis is available to you before submitting for review, and fix what it tells you to fix or note the trigger and document why its a false alarm.<p>3. You may count unit test code at 1/3 the normal rate, and even get 50 lines totally free. This relieves the burden of mentally running your code, and makes it easy to request additional test cases, which will be easier on your ego than bugs.<p>All the big problems people have with code reviews are about checking your ego, respecting your peers, and clear communication.",1355145917

Lamps, stereos, etc. are covered by code in some areas, like LA county, but by ""Underwriter Labs Approval"" in most others, in the US. A ""UL"" label (o/e) on the power cord is required for sale in most larger US communities.<p>120VAC <i>can</i> be attached by solder to an approved type of glass or phenolic circuit board inside the correct kind of enclosure. UL generally will not approve its use just about anywhere else for power-line connections.<p>This is something to keep in mind when doing any DIY project. Get a copy of the UL construction-code book. You'll find that <i>all</i> connections should be inside a non-meltable (fire-retardant) enclosure, via screw terminals, wire nuts, or compression fittings of some kind. Heat and humidity can quickly cause electrolytic corrosion on any soldered joint, eventually causing enough resistance for it to get hot and melt down.<p>Solder is great for some low-voltage dc purposes. When a connection might get subjected to heat (as in a house fire, resistive connection, etc.) the mischief that running solder can cause is just too great for it to be a good idea, so codes do not approve it in most areas. [Sorta like teflon tape in high-pressure gas lines. :-)] Over time, electrolysis slowly destroys soldered copper connections that aren't hermetically sealed, too.

Also, worth noting for me I find I use the left and middle one 90% of the time and the 3rd one is mostly for dashboards and email etc. I would assume that is probably very similar any any multi monitor setup.<p>I am trying to relate to your comment on your 55"" TV. I guess the best way I can explain it is If its like any other TV out there it has a resolution of 1920x1080 at 1080p. So if you tried to do any work at any distance it would be useless like you stated above. As a thought experiment take your TV and chop it into four sections and take your TVs resolution and put it in one of those squares. That is what 3840x2160 resolution is like. Its any easy way to remember 4K as 4 times your 1080p resolution (though it really means 4K as in 4000).  Hopefully that helps explain it better. If not just let me know.",1355144445

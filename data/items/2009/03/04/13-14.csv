While doing so I create a new page each time.  This example can be seen at craigslist.com because thats how they do their drill down.<p>I was sort of thinking like a list on the very left of the screen. The user clicks on the country and a new list gets generated via javascript to the very right of it of states.  They then click on a State and a new list then again gets generated to the very right of that with cities. etc...<p>I would love to hear more ideas.

502872,comment,501696,502831,0,0,froo,,,"I know I'm biased towards 3D animation, but I can give you examples where thats simply not the case.<p>Take Pixar, It's the highest profile of the 3D animation studios and can you name any of the voice talent for WALL-E? There was no ""top talent"" there in any notable role, in fact, apart from one of Pixar's 4 main directors (Andrew Stanton  of Finding Nemo fame) I'm pretty sure anyone would be hard pressed to name anyone of note in a major role.<p>Now lets look at Dreamworks Animation, Arguably number 2 (even though they are more profitable than Pixar and also have the highest grossing animation film of all time in Shrek 2...)<p>Apart from voice talent in their films, can you name any of the talent in the films? Its a difficult task. The talent is shared among the many people that work there.<p>The reality is that voice talent is the ""draw card"" for 3D animation and is one of the minor expenditures for any 3D film.<p>So let's go back to Pixar, when Pixar was first producing their films, their distribution deals with Disney had them giving up 50% of the profits for the film.... They do all the hard work and only get back 50% of the money.<p>On that same business model, If you figure out a way to only monetise your film 50% of the the time and not care about it being pirated (even welcoming the filesharers as pseudo distribution/marketing) - you're off to a good start.<p>If you start reducing the workload on your animators/modellers (using limited cast/sets, animating more with mocap, scripting ""extras""... essentially adopting a sitcom format) you can get away with doing episodic content with a significantly smaller team. Keep voice acting internal (even Pixar directors do voices on their films occasionally)... you're reducing costs further.<p>This I think is one of the ways out to cheaper productions and since online video has been notoriously hard to monetise - its a start.<p>I've also got a couple other ideas on ways to continue monetising off the model I'm proposing, but yeah, there is potential there.",1236174252

Is feeling beauty a spiritual event?<p>I do not know what one may mean by spirituality. Perhaps they regard spirituality in the religious sense, such as a belief in a god and that he will take care of them. However I consider spirituality to be something intrinsic in all human being and quite detached from religion.<p>Much as intellectual stimulation is the food of the brain so too beauty is the food of the heart and I believe it is in the heart where spirituality, as I see such term, reigns.<p>If spirituality is what I see it to be, then your argument seems to be flawed as you consider spirituality to be detached from the material world.<p>I do not see how one can distinguish easily the material world from the spiritual one. If the act of helping out a poor person is considered to be spiritual, such act is still carried out in the material world. It is a material act as you are helping him with material things. Same argument can be used when helping an old lady pass the road. So too the act of feeling beauty is experienced in the material world however the act itself is spiritual. \nFor some even making a difference in the material world is a spiritual act and certainly love is spiritual however facilitated through the material world.",1236173132

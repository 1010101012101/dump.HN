3902651,comment,3902319,3902647,7,0,jules,,,"It's easy enough to do a basic implementation, but getting good numerical stability and good performance is hard (and in Javascript, it's pretty much impossible with current implementations). See also the matrix multiplication benchmarks in the post: JS is 60x slower than Matlab, even though it's already using typed arrays. A naive triply nested for loop in C would probably perform similarly to the JS, which is to say a lot slower than something optimized for the characteristics of the processor (number of registers, vectorized floating point and cache sizes mostly, I'm not sure if Matlab is using multiple cores here).",1335610685

Last time I checked (justified) line breaking was a mess, protrusion is not supported and generally it's quite hard to handle font metrics without using a canvas. I guess you're right that this is changing, but it's nowhere near the quality and the ease (yes even that) of TeX or InDesign. And if you use some content preprocessor like pandoc or xslt the limitation of static information on paper isn't a problem anyway.<p>Btw, if you like to have more control over the layout have a look at ConTeXt, it's quite nice especially its modular approach.",1335610452

To gain familiarity with a phenomenon or to achieve new insights into it. Studies with this object in view are termed as exploratory or formulative research studies.\n2.	To accurately portray the characteristics of a particular individual, situation or a group. Studies with this object in view are known as descriptive research studies.\n3.

While javascript is fast (and can be used for many things), the real issue with using it for stats is the lack of libraries. More specifically, as far as I know it cannot interface with Fortran. That's a death knell for any statistical programming language, as it means no LAPACK, and no-one (sane) is going to rewrite all of those linear algebra libraries.

What you do will actually have a greater chance of changing the world through those organizations.</i><p><i>Maybe you should plant trees or study migratory patterns of marine life or dig wells in Africa.</i><p>These are the parts that I don't agree with, and they come up a ton in these conversations. How is working at UNICEF more world changing than doing a start-up that solves tough problems? Same goes for the other examples. What the author describes in the top paragraph I quoted has the potential to be significantly more world changing for the subset of people who are facing that same tough problem.<p>To me, Libin's general thought was to be driven by the right reasons, and it's in line with what this author says. A large amount of responses to Libin's talk picked on his wording, but in the end the responses are saying the exact same thing, but without the exact phrasing of ""change the world"", as that is seemingly reserved for projects involved solely with charity, Africa and cancer.",1335608170

You're conflating a <i>lot</i> of things here. You're claiming that all 'nerds' like
the feeling of superiority they get when they solve computer problems for other
'non-nerds.' Are you really attempting to apply this generalization to <i>all</i>
technical people?<p>Secondly, what does 'tricking out your gear to do all kinds of goofy, custom
stuff' have to do with being 'Nerd Jesus?' Would you call car-modders 'Auto
Jesus' if they were to complain that an car company made it harder to perform
3rd party modifications to their products?<p>How does building neat things and 'tricking out your gear' make you 'Nerd
Jesus' or make it so that you 'get to be important?'<p><pre><code>  > Serving our needs is certainly important. It's important, also, to

</code></pre>
You're setting up a false dichotomy here. There isn't some 'line' that divides
all people between extreme technical competance and 'caveman-level' technical
competance. Also remember that 51% is a majority, and that a 51/49 split is a
hell of a lot different than a 95/5 split (i.e. tossing out 'majority' and
'minority' is meaningless).<p><pre><code>  > What the iPad, and the iPhone before it, has taught us is simple: people

</code></pre>
Do you <i>really</i> believe that the majority of systems out there are 'optimized'
for your 'Nerd Jesus' rather than 'Nerd Jesus' just happening to understand the
system that already exist?<p><pre><code>  > This is all a long way of saying that I agree with you – this could be a

</code></pre>
""locking down the system"" != ""steamlining the system""<p>To frame this discussion a little differently, do you believe that instituting
a police state would result in a more stream-lined society?<p>Things like kernel extensions and compilers aren't ""going away."" Apple is just
trying their best to obfuscate them, and the fears in technical groups is that
Apple wants to make it <i>impossible</i> to access them. Are you really of the mind
that it is impossible to have a stream-lined experience on a technical device
if the <i>possibility</i> of gaining access to a compiler exists?<p>Most of people's annoyance with iOS is <i>not</i> that it's streamlined. It's that
Apple wants to be the gatekeeper, who gets to tell you what kind of software
you can run on your device. There are plenty of types of software that are
<i>outside of the realm of uber technical people</i> that Apple will <i>not</i> allow on
the device that would enhance the lives of many.<p><pre><code>  > I think there will always be a place for Nerd Jesus to do his thing. But

</code></pre>
Focusing on the 'majority' of people is different than actively trying to
thwart 'Nerd Jesus.'<p><pre><code>  > We'll see what it costs us from a nerd perspective. I suspect it's less

</code></pre>
Now that you're down off our high-hor^w^wsoapbox, the question that I pose to
you is this: Do you seriously believe that the issue that people take with the
possible changes that Apple might make to the Mac OS X platform is 100% to do
with technical people losing their ability to assert superiority over the
'mendecants' through troubleshooting their computer problems?<p>To all that upvoted this: Really HN? Really? Anyone that doesn't want a locked-down system is just some 'stupid nerd' that thinks he's going to lose his 'in' with pretty girls because they won't need their computers fixed? That seems to be the crux of this argument.",1287647581

For the parts of our codebase that are purely CPU bound Go is about 2x slower than C, fast enough that we haven't yet felt the need to rewrite in C and use GCC. For the rest of the system we get a nice flexible statically typed language that has good support for concurrency. Previously a similar project would have used Erlang/Python/C on the server side, now we can just use a single language.<p>YMMV, we (tinkercad) do data and computation intensive problems which fits the original design goal of Go pretty well. Plus we find that C/C++ programmers can transition to the language quite easily, which is a plus given the domain of graphics and computational geometry is still filled with a lot of people who have mainly used C++ for performance reasons.",1287647479

Monitis Logs enables IT managers and system administrators to be alerted when critical issues arise during the course of standard system and application level processes.<p>Monitis Logs is a web-based, real-time universal log analyzer which can collect, analyze and report any type of log files:<p>-	event logs from distributed Windows machines, 
-	system logs from distributed Unix machines,
-	routers, switches, and other network devices,
-	application logs from Apache and IIS web server,
-	FTP servers,
-	MS SQL and Oracle database servers,
-	DHCP servers.<p>Monitis Logs is highly customizable, enabling IT managers and system administrators to centrally manage notifications for events that are important to them.<p>At present, there is no comparable system on the market that can monitor each and every aspect of application and network performance from the Cloud.<p>Monitis Logs helps monitor threats to the enterprise IT resources and tightens security policies in the enterprise.  Thus, it helps organizations comply with various regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI), as well as archives logs for the purpose of network auditing and forensic analysis.<p>Monitis Logs’ on-demand log analyzer service also reduces system downtime, and increases network performance in the enterprise in a cost efficient way. It greatly improves visibility and saves hours of work for system administrators to troubleshoot problems on servers, applications, and the network.<p>Monitis Logs utilizes Syslog-ng and Rsyslog - the most widely-used open source tools for aggregating logs from multiple sources. They are already deployed in many server environments to consolidate logs across multiple machines on a LAN. In order to deal with massive amount of data, Monitis Logs uses a Casandra database, a highly scalable second-generation distributed database used by companies like Facebook, Twitter, Rackspace, and Digg.<p>With Monitis Logs, you can collect logs from any number of Syslog-ng or Rsyslog instances. “The benefits are clear.” Said Monitis Founder and CEO, Hovhannes Avoyan,  “You already have tons of installed application and servers that you need to keep running and up-to-date. So why install more just for network management and why provision new costly servers. Take advantage of what you already have to consolidate and manage all of your logs from the Cloud!  Talk about saving time!”<p>About Monitis All-in-One Monitoring Platform
Monitis is the only service that provides Systems Monitoring from the Cloud.  It is leading a new era of systems management tools – the Cloud generation.  Monitis is a 100% Cloud-based, complete, and flexible IT monitoring solution, offered on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model.<p>Monitis consolidates back-end monitoring, application monitoring, website monitoring, and cloud monitoring in an all-in-one, hosted monitoring service.

To consumers any DRM system seemed like a bigger hassle than dropping a CD in the drive, ripping the bits and then converting them to MP3s.<p>We're years away from this, but if a majority of computers don't have an optical drive to rip CDs then the average consumer loses this non-download path to digital music.

I would bet that it's difficult to find a phone that will give you signal strength in dBm at a high update rate.<p>I worked on a localization project using passive RFID tags and an RFID reader (a more power efficient setup than having active bluetooth nodes). Especially in a store/mall type environment with many people moving around, I think it becomes hard to get a decent model of expected signal propagation (mainly due to constantly changing multi-path signal amplitude).<p>All of that said, for your application you might be able to get by with the reduced accuracy (within 10 feet might work?).<p>With bluetooth, you also have to consider the number of connections a bluetooth receiver can handle. That will probably greatly restrict your density of nodes. RFID again holds an advantage here, in that RFID is a very low-level interaction, while bluetooth is much higher level.

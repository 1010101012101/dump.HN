Might be more of a prestige/advertising thing (sponsored by the german train company). Part of the problem is that it is difficult to sign up for one, though (registration through phone). Perhaps other models are better conceived. ",1196610869

That can be changed over time.  <p>It's precisely the fact that there isn't a large market for two-sided screens that Bug exists.  People with niche needs (like two-sided screens) are currently out of luck since Sony and Apple won't address it.  Bug addresses people with niche needs across many different niches.  That's their market.<p>The other thing is that people not only build their devices like legos, but people can build their own pieces.  For creative builders like most of the people on hacker news, that should be exciting.\n",1196610506

Seems to me that if using it yields more than it costs, it should be possible to afford it (loans?)? On the other hand, if it doesn't make sense economically, giving it to the farmers for free just ensures that they will never have profitable businesses (ie perhaps instead of farming, they should do something else).<p>Also, weren't many soils in Africa destroyed by the use of the wrong kind of fertilizer?<p>I know that is too simplistic either, as for some reason they might have no choice but to be farmers. But then I suppose politics would be to blame, not the experts.",1196609085

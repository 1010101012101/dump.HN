9510860,comment,9509357,9510624,0,0,dalke,,,"There are a number of differences between what streetcars do and what you mention.<p>The streetcars I&#x27;m most familiar with are directly connected to the power grid through overhead lines, and are on rails. Cars would need batteries as private cars won&#x27;t have a pantograph, or fuel. In either case, there are more things that can break in a fleet of smaller vehicles, so maintenance is higher. Cars also use rubber wheels on pavement, rather than steel wheels on rails, so have higher rolling friction.<p>Streetcars can also handle a high density of passengers. This is important for rush hour, when the load is high. A streetcar has about 3x the capacity of a similarly sized bus, which is in turn much higher than passenger vehicles. In turn, as the article points out, streetcars are best when they have dedicated right-of-way, which allows a higher throughput and predictable latency compared to cars, which are more subject to gridlock. Also, the improved capacity feeds back on itself when people build high-density (eg, 5 story buildings instead of single family houses) along streetcar corridors.<p>The more recent streetcars are also better designed for a wide variety of users. For example, some of the ones I know have a platform which is only slightly above the curb level. This makes it easier for a parent pushing a stroller, or someone with difficulties walking, or on a wheelchair, to enter the streetcar unassisted. The same is not true of most cars.<p>Finally, there are some environmental difference. A personal vehicle has the advantage of not sharing space with strangers. It has the disadvantage that you and your 9 friends can&#x27;t all travel together. And a streetcar is usually a much smoother ride; a friend get nauseous after 10 minutes as a passenger in cars and buses, but not in streetcars.<p>So while what your friend says is true, there are other factors which make it less compelling.",1431082218

9510853,comment,9505894,9509522,0,0,swombat,,,"Whilst I&#x27;ve had some 121s that were cut short if the person was very busy and just wanted to focus on something else, most took the full hour and some overran.<p>The structure was very fluid, but I generally did start with a fairly straightforward open question: &quot;So, how are you doing?&quot;<p>Then I generally let the person take it from there. In my experience there are three major kinds of conversation that emerge:<p>1) The phatic conversation: the other person wants to get stuff off their chest, wants to express it and to feel listened to. This may seem like a waste of time to people who don&#x27;t understand human beings, but this is actually a hugely important part of 121s and probably the one people get wrong the most, as they tend to confuse this with the second and third kind. Offering advice or suggesting a conflict-resolution approach when the person just wants to be heard is not helpful. Listen to them, hear them, acknowledge how they feel, etc. That&#x27;s the goal here.<p>2) The problem-solving conversation: the other person wants advice on a problem they&#x27;re facing. I often fall into that mode because it&#x27;s my natural mode... Basically, you help the other person figure out what the solution is to their problem. Sometimes, if they&#x27;re explicitly asking, maybe you directly suggest the solution. Often, you help the person work out the solution for themselves (much more powerful).<p>3) The conflict resolution conversation: the other person has a conflict, which they may or may not be aware of, and needs external help to be able to resolve that conflict. This has become much less frequent since our conflict resolution skills have improved across the company, but often there are natural frictions when smart people work hard together, and this conversation is about identifying this friction, making sure the person feels their point of view is understood (so kind of like type #1), and then going and speaking to the other person in the conflict, fully understanding their position as well, and then helping both people see each other&#x27;s viewpoints so they can come to a joint understanding. Ideally, once people learn good conflict resolution skills, they can do this for themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t impose either structure on the person I&#x27;m having a 121 with. It&#x27;s their time, a bit like a therapy session, and they can take it wherever they want it. My job is to spend some time talking to them and genuinely care about them. This one element is the most important: you have to actually give a shit about people. If you don&#x27;t, if you&#x27;re just doing this for some utilitarian purpose, it will be felt and will not have the desired effect.",1431081980

So for the past 5 years, it&#x27;s been almost all the work of sds, Sam
Steingold. Huh. I was expecting Bruno Haible to still be involved, but he seems to be doing almost nothing nowadays. Well, it&#x27;s not unusual for a free project to be the labour of only a single person, but it&#x27;s typical to have a lot of small drive-by contributions. Almost nobody except sds has done anything for CLISP for the last five years, which could explain why there have been no releases. But there&#x27;s been a lot of work being done! Look at all those lines of code that have been modified! Maybe all they really need is a release manager.<p>Well, does the thing build right now?<p><pre><code>    $ ./configure
    ...
    ./configure: libsigsegv was not detected, thus some features, such as
      generational garbage collection and
      stack overflow detection in interpreted Lisp code
    cannot be provided.
    Please install libsigsegv like this:
    ...
</code></pre>
Okay, fine, I&#x27;ll install it. Let me try again,<p><pre><code>     $ ./configure
    ...
    ./configure: libsigsegv was not detected, thus some features, such as
      generational garbage collection and
      stack overflow detection in interpreted Lisp code
    cannot be provided.
    Please install libsigsegv like this:
    ...
</code></pre>
What? Didn&#x27;t I just do that?<p><pre><code>    $ apt-cache policy libsigsegv-dev
    libsigsegv-dev:
      Installed: 2.9-4
      Candidate: 2.9-4
      Version table:
         2.10-4+b1 0
             -1 http://ftp.ca.debian.org/debian/ unstable/main amd64 Packages

</code></pre>
Okay, maybe my version of libsigsegv is too old. But a version newer than Debian&#x27;s oldstable is mighty demanding of a package whose development has slowed down to nothing. So at this point I&#x27;m considering if I want to debug their build system or not. I might. Or perhaps someone else will. My conclusion is that CLisp development is almost dead, yet there certainly is something worthwhile releasing here since the last release in 2010.",1431081404

9510812,comment,9509698,9509698,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Bug #3 – Obscure Behavior<p>> We claim this is a bug – intentional or not.<p>I like seeing this described as a bug. Bug #3 is documented behavior (there&#x27;s a comment right there in the source calling it out), and it does what it&#x27;s intended to do, and the relevant RFC says that it should be doing that. It&#x27;s only a &quot;bug&quot; in the sense that the behavior is nevertheless metaphysically incorrect.<p>I once wrote java code doing bit shifts of arbitrary length as part of a programming contest at my school. It failed on a single test case for mysterious reasons. I eventually discovered that my algorithm was totally correct -- but I had been assuming that if you shift a 32-bit integer by 32 or more bits, you&#x27;ll get zero. In fact, and this is <i>required</i> by the java specification, you get unpredictable garbage data. More specifically, the java standard mandates that &quot;a << b&quot; be silently compiled to &quot;a << (b % 32)&quot;. So I had to rewrite code like this:<p><pre><code>    bit_pattern = bit_pattern << potentially_large_value;
</code></pre>
into something more like this:<p><pre><code>    // if you shift by x, Java will silently rewrite it as a shift by (x % 32)
    while( potentially_large_value > 31 ) {
      bit_pattern = bit_pattern << 31;
      potentially_large_value -= 31;
    }
    bit_pattern = bit_pattern << potentially_large_value;
</code></pre>
I can imagine no circumstance where this would be useful or helpful in any way. Even later, I found out that the JVM bytecode for bit shifting uses a 5-bit operand, and I surmise that the standard is written the way it is to make it slightly (slightly!) simpler to compile a Java shift statement into a JVM bytecode instruction. I can&#x27;t call this a bug in javac -- it&#x27;s doing exactly what it&#x27;s required to do! But the only way it makes sense to me to describe this is as a bug in the Java specification. If I say to do something 45 times, that should be the same thing as doing it 15 times, and then another 15 times, and then 15 more times. It shouldn&#x27;t instead be the same as doing it 13 times.",1431080199

You can share that phrase with anyone that you want to make changes to your account. Verizon probably should not call it 'Password'. It is NOT the password that you use to login to their site to pay your bill or anything else. The author is confused on the whole process. The customer service rep as well should have done a better job to explain to him the process as well.",1361995194

They're quite usable even when you have an open window behind you on a sunny day.<p>If you want to develop on multiple operating systems, well, I recommend making sure you get a CPU with VT-d.  If your current machine on which virtual machines are painful doesn't have VT-d, I recommend trying one that does.  (And of course, get sufficient RAM.)  VMs seem painless to me, at least on the machines with VT-d that I've tried, and somewhat painful on machines without VT-d.

It is a quality which in a moderate degree is essential. It may be useful when developed to a very great degree, but only if accompanied and controlled by other qualities; and without such control the possessor tends to develop into one of the least attractive types produced by a modern industrial democracy.""<p>How about,<p>""In short, the good citizen in a republic must realize that he ought to possess two sets of qualities, and that neither avails without the other. He must have those qualities which make for efficiency; and that he also must have those qualities which direct the efficiency into channels for the public good. He is useless if he is inefficient. There is nothing to be done with that type of citizen of whom all that can be said is that he is harmless. Virtue which is dependant upon a sluggish circulation is not impressive. There is little place in active life for the timid good man. The man who is saved by weakness from robust wickedness is likewise rendered immune from robuster virtues. The good citizen in a republic must first of all be able to hold his own. He is no good citizen unless he has the ability which will make him work hard and which at need will make him fight hard. The good citizen is not a good citizen unless he is an efficient citizen.""<p>How about,<p>""The citizen must have high ideals, and yet he must be able to achieve them in practical fashion. No permanent good comes from aspirations so lofty that they have grown fantastic and have become impossible and indeed undesirable to realize. The impractical visionary is far less often the guide and precursor than he is the embittered foe of the real reformer, of the man who, with stumblings and shortcoming, yet does in some shape, in practical fashion, give effect to the hopes and desires of those who strive for better things. Woe to the empty phrase-maker, to the empty idealist, who, instead of making ready the ground for the man of action, turns against him when he appears and hampers him when he does work! Moreover, the preacher of ideals must remember how sorry and contemptible is the figure which he will cut, how great the damage that he will do, if he does not himself, in his own life, strive measurably to realize the ideals that he preaches for others. Let him remember also that the worth of the ideal must be largely determined by the success with which it can in practice be realized. We should abhor the so-called ""practical"" men whose practicality assumes the shape of that peculiar baseness which finds its expression in disbelief in morality and decency, in disregard of high standards of living and conduct. Such a creature is the worst enemy of the body of politic. But only less desirable as a citizen is his nominal opponent and real ally, the man of fantastic vision who makes the impossible better forever the enemy of the possible good.""<p>How about,<p>""Individual initiative, so far from being discouraged, should be stimulated; and yet we should remember that, as society develops and grows more complex, we continually find that things which once it was desirable to leave to individual initiative can, under changed conditions, be performed with better results by common effort.""<p>How about,<p>""Of one man in especial, beyond any one else, the citizens of a republic should beware, and that is of the man who appeals to them to support him on the ground that he is hostile to other citizens of the republic, that he will secure for those who elect him, in one shape or another, profit at the expense of other citizens of the republic. It makes no difference whether he appeals to class hatred or class interest, to religious or antireligious prejudice. The man who makes such an appeal should always be presumed to make it for the sake of furthering his own interest. The very last thing an intelligent and self-respecting member of a democratic community should do is to reward any public man because that public man says that he will get the private citizen something to which this private citizen is not entitled, or will gratify some emotion or animosity which this private citizen ought not to possess.""<p>For my part, while there are a few sections I find questionable, I largely like the whole thing.",1361994969

People try to use their spreadsheets as databases when the spreadsheet really isn't prepared for that. Permanent solves this problem by using a column-oriented backing store, with no additional burden placed on the user. You can enter data into your spreadsheets in whichever way suits you, and then run scripts against a real column-oriented data store. Permanent is pretty fast already without any special optimizations. Most queries we've tried run faster on Permanent on the iPad than on Excel on the desktop. You can put millions of rows on your iPad no problem. We haven't spent too much time optimizing for these high-performance cases yet, so there's maybe 10x worth of improvements still available.",1361994608

I don't dwell to much on it as I catch myself and look at their background. For example, I will use the founder of one particular company (which I won't name). Let's see, father is CEO/founder of a medical company (ie. already no risk of any real failure - dad is available for a start-up capital and a job if things don't workout). He is graduating from Stanford (already higher chance of success, considering the reputation and connections that exist). I watch a presentation with the father and son and I just could not understand how this person felt they were taking a huge risk by doing their start-up versus ""getting a job"". He mentioned the risk and it really emphasized the vacuum some of these founders live in.<p>I will gladly give more respect to people such as Mark Cuban and many others like him who have built their companies from the start with real risk and real failure.<p>I wish the best of success for these people that do have these really good circumstances. Being able to leverage their good fortune to do a start-up is adding value to society but I tend to find it a bit too much sometimes when I read about the struggles of these people that have the good circumstances. I also feel it perhaps leads some people astray who should not do a start-up as the consequences of failure are extremely bad as they don't have the good circumstances to cushion the failures.",1361993250

In a way one could say that rotation changes the shape of the black hole and that property can be observed from the outside to determine the spin. This is cool because, while pretty much everybody was certain that black holes <i>do</i> spin, this hypothesis was not yet backed up by data.

You shouldn't commit suicide. Even if the corrupt and incompetent federal government charges you with 50 years in prison for downloading journal articles. Don't commit suicide.<p>If Jeff's article had read like your comment, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

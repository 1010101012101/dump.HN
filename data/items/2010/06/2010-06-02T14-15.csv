Like the other commenter remarked, Schneier is merely saying that because of the large amount of open wireless netwokrs, the chances that he's the one that'll be caught are so small that the risk outweighs the benefits.<p>Secondly, Schneier (as knowledgeable about crypto and security in general as he is) is in no position to be an expert witness on the interpretation of legal concepts like whether or not this liability exists in the present case. Even worse, by publicizing this article, he is basically making it public that he knows about the dangers yet deliberately ignores it, and thus enables eventual wrongdoers. I think he should talk his lawyer friends again that he mentions in the article to assess the potential extra damage he's doing to himself by publishing this. In effect it's what I mentioned in another comment above about people who are technically adept and therefore will be held to a higher standard.

Specifically the convenience of exploring different technical options in an automated design space exploration kind of fashion.<p>It seems like we have features that people might like, but we have to position it in ways different to what we currently believe would work?<p>Our webapp is pitching a minimalistic way of doing things, in that what the libraries and TCL scripts that you mentioned do, will be done automatically.

The latter does not really support the concluusion that patents are not useful/effective, since a lack of imitators is something we should expect if they were (though it also is not proof that they are).

I'll try to explain:<p>It is socially accepted that companies may speak about their products in a onesided, strongly biased way, called ""advertisement"". This is in contrast to balanced, objective reports as expected from e.g. journalists and scientists. And it is also in contrast to honest, uninfluenced personal opinions as expected from e.g. friends and blogs.<p>In return, those ""advertisements"" are expected to be explicitly labeled as such, or to be so exaggerated that they are obviously visible as such. That's how we try to ensure fairness.<p>In a sense this is the case here, because the ""blog entry"" is shown under your website's domain. On the other hand, it is a user report of someone (i.e. you) who is using and testing your software, where one usually expects the honest and uninfluenced personal opinion of a user.<p>It is okay as it is. But if you changed one detail, it wouldn't be okay anymore. (e.g. write about another website rather than your own, or put it into another blog at another domain, or remove the exaggeration in the title as well as the text.)<p>So it is scary, because it is close to the border.

The reason why we are online is that we can leverage on the cloud and make things run 5X, 10x or 20x faster and cheaper.<p>But will we ever get the IP vendors to trust us? We once thought about doing an 256bit AES client for them to encrypt their data before sending over. But after chewing on it, we felt that the problem is a perception issue. It is a matter of trust. It is like we use our credit cards online because we trust the payment merchants with our details. Will this problem eventually be eroded by time?<p>Oh btw, I am harnhua's cofounder.

My wife, who just uses her iPhone to look at maps and mail, only does maybe 100MB/month.  If not for that she might want to switch to the iPhone 4G and who knows how data intensive it might be (may be worth it to stay grandfathered), we could save $15/month on by cutting back to the $15/200MB plan for her line.

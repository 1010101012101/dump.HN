If you find yourself floating around in the same circles, that hype is being spread and regurgitated to you time and time again. You'd be living in your own personal bubble, shielded from the realities of non-SV people. A lot of this hype gets people excited and allows new things to happen; and those with their head on their shoulders will be able to see past hype and see a successful outcome for themselves.<p>",1179849465

Yet it is an idea that keeps on popping up (recent nytimes article for example). The reason may simply be that there are more people in that age group starting companies. A larger starting pool results in a larger pool of success. But as is the case with any statistic it seems, people mistake it for truth. So in conclusion, no, 30+ is not too old to start a company. But if you want to use it as an excuse to sit on the sidelines, by all means, do so.",1179846957

Personally I tend to believe its untrue only because they're a large company and certainly someone would have blown a whistle by now. The bot would have to be in-house to know people's maximum bids, and no individual employee would have incentive to create such a thing, so it would have to be a top-down directive.",1229234320

Every time I hear economists talk about it pre and post crash, it's always with the same kind of confidence that the article ascribes to Kreuger.  Since the economy thrives on confidence, there is incentive for economists to lie to us.",1229234030

I must add that we have dozens if not hundreds of branches.<p>3. tests. tests must be in sync with the code, and are branched/merged together. a lot of tests.<p>4. test results. must be in sync with tests and branched/merged together.<p>So there you have it.<p>Other people I know who also have large repsitories are art studios who want to version their artwork - they store raw images.",1229231535

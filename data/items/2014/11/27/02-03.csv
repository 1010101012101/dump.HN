8665786,comment,8664400,8665249,0,0,modeless,,,"There are also cryptographic risks associated with reusing an address, not just identity risks. The address is a hash of your public key. You don&#x27;t have to reveal the public key matching the address until you spend from the address. When the public key is secret, your address is safe even from hypothetical attacks on Bitcoin&#x27;s crypto implementation. Once you spend from the address, the public key is public knowledge and that extra protection is lost.<p><a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse</a>",1417057121

If there was a profitable opportunity to find &quot;99.99% of talented, unknown founders&quot; by accepting cold emails, then some VCs would start doing it.<p>I would guess the reason they don&#x27;t is because the authors assumption is wrong. If you&#x27;re a talented, driven founder with a growing startup then it&#x27;s not really that hard to get a meeting with a top tier VC.<p>The problem with accepting cold emails is the sheer volume. Unless there is a standard filtering process, partners will waste too much time with crappy startups.<p>A solution to this would be to create a standardized format (kind of like the YC application) which founders could submit to multiple VCs.

As many others here, i was <i>sure</i> there wouldn&#x27;t be a difference if Monty picked at random AND we ignored the cases where he picks the door with the car. But after reading &quot;write the damn simulation!&quot; too many times, i wrote one, being sure it would prove me right.<p>Of course, i was wrong :D<p>The simulation testing the four possible scenarios:<p><pre><code>  #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n  \n  def run_games(monty_knows:, change_choice:)\n    options = [:goat1, :goat2, :car]\n    total_games = 0\n    wins = 0\n  \n    100000.times do\n      choice = options.sample\n      monty_choice = (options - [choice, (:car if monty_knows)]).sample\n  \n      # Don&#x27;t consider cases where Monty shows a car.\n      next if monty_choice == :car\n  \n      if change_choice\n        choice = (options - [monty_choice, choice]).first\n      end\n  \n      total_games += 1\n      wins += 1 if choice == :car\n    end\n  \n    wins / total_games.to_f\n  end\n  \n  puts &#x27;Monty knows & keep choice: %.2f&#x27; %\n         run_games(monty_knows: true, change_choice: false)\n  puts &#x27;Monty knows & change choice: %.2f&#x27; %\n         run_games(monty_knows: true, change_choice: true)\n  puts &#x27;Monty ignores & keep choice: %.2f&#x27; %\n         run_games(monty_knows: false, change_choice: false)\n  puts &#x27;Monty ignores & change choice: %.2f&#x27; %\n         run_games(monty_knows: false, change_choice: true)\n</code></pre>\nSample output:<p><pre><code>  Monty knows & keep choice: 0.33\n  Monty knows & change choice: 0.67\n  Monty ignores & keep choice: 0.50\n  Monty ignores & change choice: 0.50\n</code></pre>\nSo, in the case of Monty picking at random, even if we ignore the cases where he picks the car, your chances of winning do not improve by changing your first choice or not.<p>After verifying that the simulation makes sense, i tried to figure out <i>why</i> it makes sense.<p>In an information theory kinda way, it makes sense that if Monty picks at random then he is not providing any new information: you are just being shown what was behind a random door you didn&#x27;t choose and you can&#x27;t choose now. But that explanation is not intuitive to my brain.<p>I found it more intuitive to actually draw a decision tree with the possibilities and their probabilities. The tree is actually very simple:<p>With the Always Change Door strategy:<p><pre><code>               car (1/3) -> LOSE (Monty always reveals goat,\n              /                   we change and we always lose)\n  first choice\n              \                            goat (1/2) -> WIN (we change to the\n               \                          /                   car door)\n                goat (2/3) -> Monty choice\n                                          \\n                                           car (1/2) -> IGNORE\n</code></pre>\nThe probability of winning is 1/3 (2/3 * 1/2).<p>With the Always Keep Door strategy:<p><pre><code>               car (1/3) -> WIN (doesn&#x27;t matter what Monty chooses)\n              /\n  first choice\n              \                            goat (1/2) -> LOSE (we keep our\n               \                          /                    goat-hiding door)\n                goat (2/3) -> Monty choice\n                                          \\n                                           car (1/2) -> IGNORE \n</code></pre>\nSame tree, but with win and lose cases inverted. The probability of winning is also 1/3.<p>In conclusion, my intuition sucks. Thanks for showing me so!",1417055441

Essentially the book explains how things currently are made in a &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot; style, meaning products are sourced from the earth and then deposited back in an unusable form. Cradle to cradle would be where a product is made and when it&#x27;s life is up we reuse the product&#x27;s materials to build a new product. This is not how recycling works. Recycling could be better described as &quot;downcycling&quot; in that every time say plastic is recycled it&#x27;s grade is lowered and it becomes less useful due to being mixed with other plastics and contaminates. The book explains this much better than I and is also a great primer on material science.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple example of how a consumer product can be created in a cradle to cradle fashion.<p>1) Raw materials are sourced from the earth.<p>2) Raw materials are manufactured together in a way where they can easily be seperated.<p>3) Product ends up with a consumer.<p>4) Product lifecycle ends.<p>5) Manufacturer pays consumer for the product.<p>6) Manufacturer uses product&#x27;s raw materials for step 2.",1417055382

The web has suffered enough of that bullshit, we seriously don&#x27;t need another. Example 7 (mixing scalar and array types) gives me shudders. Example 10 (mismatched braces) seems to have a reasonable fallback behavior, though I&#x27;d prefer dropping the malformed field altogether.<p>If the form is obviously malformed, transmission <i>should</i> fail, and it should fail as loudly and catastrophically as possible, so that the developer is forced to correct the mistake before the code in question ever leaves the dev box.<p>Preferably, the form shouldn&#x27;t even work if any part of it is malformed. If we&#x27;re too timid to do that, at least we should leave out malformed fields instead of silently shuffling them around. Otherwise we&#x27;ll end up with frameworks that check three different places and return the closest match, leaving the developer blissfully ignorant of his error.<p>While we&#x27;re at it, we also need strict limits on valid paths (e.g. no mismatched braces, no braces inside braces) and nesting depth (most frameworks already enforce some sort of limit there), and what to do when such limits are violated. Again, the default should be a loud warning and obvious failure, not silent mangling to make the data fit.<p>This is supposed to be a new standard, there&#x27;s no backward-compatibility baggage to carry.

People who are neurotypical tend to assume that everyone else is neurotypical as well. Open-source was and has always been a place where those on the aspie-autistic end of the spectrum can and do excel. Elevating feelings over code and being technically correct creates and environment that is fraught for those people who generally have less empathy and don&#x27;t really get offended themselves.<p>Between making open source welcoming to people who are neurotypical and making it welcome to people on the aspie-autistic end of the spectrum, we all lose by favoring the former. The overwhelming majority of truly valuable contributions in our field are done by people who are neurologically aspie-autistic.",1417054009

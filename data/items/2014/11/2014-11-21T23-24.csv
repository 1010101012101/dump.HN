In the past the responses have always been to things that actually seem worth responding to (though there&#x27;s plenty of disagreement about specific responses). In this case, I haven&#x27;t seen any of these negative articles, so anecdotally, it seems perhaps not widely-reported enough to be worth a public blog post.<p>Furthermore, while I think describing why the deal is a good idea is reasonable, that whole lead-off with &quot;haha they&#x27;re gamblers, you think Tesla could pull a fast one on them?&quot; is kind of strange. It&#x27;s basically an appeal to authority, where the &quot;authority&quot; is people who oversee the gambling industry, and the claim is that because casinos are really good at not being tricked, then their overseers (i.e. the Nevada legislature) must be even better. Except it doesn&#x27;t work like that, the casinos are not gambling with the state, or trying to pull a fast one on the state at all. And the Nevada legislature doesn&#x27;t directly oversee the casinos anyway; they simply tax them. It&#x27;s the Nevada Gaming Commission that does the actual regulation of the casinos.<p>Basically, that second paragraph is just a combination of multiple rhetorical fallacies intended to imply that it&#x27;s preposterous to claim that Tesla could ever get the Nevada legislature to agree to a bad deal. And for any readers who recognize this, it only serves to weaken the rest of the blog post. If that entire paragraph (and the single word &quot;Moreover&quot; from the start of the next paragraph) were to be deleted from the post, the post would make just as much sense and would have a stronger, more focused point.

I ran another company (Servprise International) for 4.5 years and went through the adjustment back to a full-time job.  The biggest difference is this time I&#x27;m older and wanted to think about something I could reasonably see myself doing for 3 - 4 years, at least.<p>I&#x27;m actually fairly at ease with things.  Making the decision to leave it behind was liberating.  Dealing with the BS required to shutdown a company is just annoying.  But, the open source question has come up quite a few times.  I wanted to give it more than a simple &quot;no&quot; answer and explain why.  I feel like it&#x27;s really a loaded question to ask a start-up that just shutdown, especially when it&#x27;s not often asked of start-ups still running.<p>I threw the pettiness quip in there to be intellectually honest.  Taken out, I don&#x27;t think it materially changes the decision.  But I wanted to address it.  I&#x27;m human.  I certainly have irrational tendencies and I&#x27;m rather okay with that.  Sure, I&#x27;ll work on them, but humans aren&#x27;t perfect automata even if this forum is wont to linking to Wikipedia pages on logical fallacies.

When you write something like that, I wonder where you have been in the world. I was in Las Vegas for the first time since the 1980s just more than a year ago, to meet up with high school classmates of my wife--who attended high school in Taiwan. The classmates we met were not the only Chinese-speaking visitors we encountered who had just flown across the Pacific to be in Las Vegas, not by far.<p>I actually don&#x27;t have a particular place in mind as I read the phrase &quot;entertainment capital of the world,&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure I would say off-hand that there is any place that outranks one city or another in the United States for that designation. The United States is, after all, second only to France in the number of international tourist visitors it receives each year, and at least some of the tourists who come here come for entertainment of one kind or another. Many consumers of mass media entertainment in other parts of the world consume quite a lot of entertainment that is produced in the United States (although not so much that is produced in Nevada, methinks, as contrasted with California or New York).<p>In the context of the article kindly submitted here to open the thread, it is clear that Musk could have written &quot;gaming capital of the world&quot; (that&#x27;s the Nevada way of saying it) or &quot;legalized gambling capital of the world&quot; (that&#x27;s how I&#x27;d say it, to be clear what kind of &quot;gaming&quot; is being written about), and then he would have been both more coherent with the point he was making and less likely to cause topic drift like the topic drift found in the subthread here. His argument is that a state that regulates a lot of gambling knows how to bet wisely in its state regulations.<p>AFTER EDIT: Hat tip to the other participant in this same subthread who pointed out that Las Vegas uses the term &quot;entertainment capital of the world&quot; as a promotional slogan.[1] But people outside Las Vegas refer to Los Angeles with that designation.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds-entertainment-capital/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.todayszaman.com/travel_los-angeles-entertainment-capital-of-the-world_332513.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.todayszaman.com/travel_los-angeles-entertainment-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/places/ca/los-angeles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/places/ca/los-angeles/</a><p><a href=""http://www.columbiawestcollege.edu/featured/hello-world/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbiawestcollege.edu/featured/hello-world/</a>",1416612644

8644008,comment,8642904,8643883,0,0,ash,,,"Answering my own question. The robot is based on Kilobot that uses similar locomotion:<p>&quot;The Kilobots move by controlling two vibrating motors, the same type as you have in your mobile phone and the movement is based on similar micro vibrations. The same principle is used when you leave your phone on a table and the vibrator goes off. The Kilobots actually jump forward, but the jumps are vertically so small that you don&#x27;t see them leave the table surface. They actually fly for a little while. The robots accurately controlled motion to ensure that the locomotion stays energy efficient, conserving the battery for an extended operating time.&quot;
<a href=""http://m.electronicdesign.com/boards/kilobot-swarms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.electronicdesign.com/boards/kilobot-swarms</a><p>And:<p>&quot;Kilobot uses two sealed coin shaped vibration motors for locomotion. When one of these motors is activated, the centripetal forces generated by the vibrating motor are converted to a forward force on the Kilobot located at the motor’s mounting location. The principle of converting the motor vibration to a forward force can be explained using the slip-stick principle…
The slip-stick locomotion of a Kilobot was confirmed using high-speed video of the robot’s movement. Due to the off-center mounting of the two vibration motors, as shown in Fig. 1, the vibration of one motor alone will cause a rotation of the Kilobot about its vertical axis, while the vibration of the other motor will cause an opposite rotation. By controlling the magnitude of vibration for the two motors independently in a differential drive manner, the robot can move in a continuous range from clockwise rotation, to straight forward, to counterclockwise rotation. This enables the Kilobot to move approximately 1 cm/sec and rotate approximately 45 degrees/sec.&quot;

The school/principle are very supportive of what we are doing, but we have limited funding so try to stretch every dollar as far as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the students respond most enthusiastically to any kind of programming that involves making something happen outside of the computer they are working at. That could be anything from writing code to send text messages to building robots and writing code to control them.<p>Thus far I&#x27;ve kicked in some of my own money to buy some Arduinos/Beagle Bones and various motors, servos, etc. Those things don&#x27;t end up costing that much, but there is quite a lot of work to be done before the students can see any results, so only the more advanced students maintain interest. I think having an inexpensive platform like this that is ready to program for is a huge win.<p>The one thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about is it seems like this robot is programmed via a drag and drop graphical environment. I find that the students are perfectly capable of understanding simple code instructions and obscuring the programming with graphical elements just complicates their understanding of what&#x27;s really happening. From another article about this robot it seems to indicate that code is being generated in the background, so hopefully that is easily editable, or the graphical environment can be ignored completely.",1416611101

8643915,comment,8642803,8643585,0,0,maverick2,,,"ok, yep let me clear that. What I mean is<p>-Companies should be able to own and trade their users data with other companies. This should be like a stock or ad exchange. More pull requests for certain data, higher the data  connection price.<p>-Also blogs should be able to charge $0 or some amount for search bots to crawl them. Its demand and supply if. NYT might be able to ask for some price while Buzzfeed can say .. eh we&#x27;ll set that to free.<p>-Now for user, Example If I pay $200 for a robot - The company can say, hey it is $10 to use it monthly(because the robot company figures that is avg cost to fetch data, lets say from Goog FB AMZN etc). But some companies can say, the data of their users is owned by them and their user so if the user want to use his/her data then its free. But if the company wants to use to for some other means without user consent then its up for sale.<p>Its kind of like twitter&#x27;s firehose, just more universal. Will encourage companies to develop APIs since now they can charge its use.
I&#x27;d love a google now/robot to suggest me what netflix flick I should see based on my Bing search history.",1416611060

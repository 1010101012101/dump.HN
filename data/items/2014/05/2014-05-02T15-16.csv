It&#x27;s just...we had the nuclear arms race, which we eventually realized was folly and really could only result in negative impact to humanity, so we started moving towards disarmament...only to start the cycle over again with digital information gathering, which is a lot easier to hide than a nuclear weapons program (and weaves itself into the fabric of citizens&#x27; private lives, in that sense it&#x27;s much more sinister).<p>Who has the fortitude to step up and lead us (by example)  towards a healthier geopolitical climate?

Many of Firefox&#x27;s stability issues are due to 3rd party components (plugins and addons). I recommend disabling all of them, restarting the browser, and seeing if the issues persist. You can then selectively enable (or click-to-play, for plugins) them to improve your experience while maintaining stability.\n2. You could also try a profile reset [0], which tends to magically fix some problems (especially if you&#x27;ve had the profile for a while).<p>[0] <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fix-most-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reset-firefox-easily-fi...</a>",1399046286

Especially with the proliferation of both in-browser content policies (CSP, Mixed Content blocking, etc.) and out-of-browser content policies (addons like Privacy Badger, ABP, Ghostery, etc.) it&#x27;s almost impossible to understand the root cause of what&#x27;s breaking a page, especially if you&#x27;re not a technical user.<p>> but also making it work efficiently (wrote custom ABP engine from scratch which doesn&#x27;t suffer the real one&#x27;s abuse of memory/CPU)<p>For the Firefox version of Privacy Badger, we also eschewed the ABP engine in favor of something we wrote ourselves. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, ABP is a great tool and we learned a lot from its code - but we wanted something as lean and performant as possible. I&#x27;d be interested to see the approach you took!<p>> only one extension is allowed to modify the HTTP headers<p>> it will break any previously installed extension<p>That sounds like a shortcoming in Chrome&#x27;s Extension API. Firefox is somewhat better in that we do not restrict addons based on the behavior of other addons, so multiple addons are allowed to modify a request&#x27;s headers. Unfortunately, the order in which the request is passed from handler to handler is not guaranteed, so in practice this may not end up being so useful.<p>We&#x27;re trying to improve this situation by rewriting the Gecko Content Policy API [0], but that&#x27;s a large project with no clear deadline.<p>[0] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/veLFoy09ydg/2XcWUXSiVbEJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/v...</a><p>Generally I think your addon and Privacy Badger are targeted at different audiences and have different use cases.

But the adserving industry are not picking sides in that debate. they don&#x27;t want your name, and they are not keeping any data any milisecond longer than required, because it&#x27;s all low-margin: costs matter a lot.<p>People want all their content for free. People don&#x27;t want annoying popups all the time. So when you look at some product, you get a cookie. That product-id and the cookie-id  (that refers to your browser, not you) go into a typical cassandra or redis cluster for about 30 days. Then they are deleted.<p>End result: (1) your content is free (2) you are not drowning in ads (3) your privacy was not violated. Nobody in _this_ sector wants to store your personal stuff.<p>People should be concerned about what identity-providers (like Google or Facebook) do with your information. And people should be very wary of identity-providers where you are not the customer. But pure adserving companies, the ones targetted with this tool, were never messing with your privacy in the first place. All tools like this do, is put websites out of bussiness.<p>Can the intelligent people in HN please start getting more informed about the difference between these two sectors?<p>Retargeting-sector ==> Be anonymous, see few ads, get free content. Low-margin, technology-driven.<p>Identity-sector ==> Give all your info, see lots of ads, spam your friends. High-margin, social-life-extortion-driven.<p>And maybe, not freak out so much about &#x27;retargeting&#x27;. Retargeting is fine: its why so much of the internet is free. It funds many YC companies (like Reddit). Just don&#x27;t ever deal with identity providers who also sell ads. But that&#x27;s about 10 scripts of the thousands that are blocked by this tool.",1399045794

7686370,comment,7684650,7685618,4,0,shanusmagnus,,,"I want to add some nuance to this.<p>> Plainly, basing psychological research on subjects who are mostly undergraduates at United States universities is not a good idea<p>Good for what, or whom?  The original BBS article shows that a slew of psychological results, even those from the most robust subfields like perceptual processing, are not so universally constant as they were previously assumed to be.  From the point of view of a particular paper on the processing of visual illusions, for instance, this is bad news insofar as it violates the data from that paper; and bad insofar as models based on that data will now require an asterisk.<p>I maintain that this isn&#x27;t a bad thing.  In the grand scheme, it would obviously be better if models of cognition that grew out of psych research were &#x27;correct&#x27; and took into account all relevant issues from the very start, so that (for instance) we knew that environmental geometry would give rise to perceptual foreshortening and lengthening effects in one case and not another.<p>But this isn&#x27;t the way the logistics of the field works; and the &#x27;increasing efforts to broaden the samples&#x27; you mention is still an infinitesimal drop in the bucket in 99% of the cases.  I work in the psych department of a major research university and I&#x27;ll tell you that screwing down the demographic requirements of our investigations would not lead to fuller and more apt models, it would lead to an utter absence of the experiment to begin with, as we lack the money to ship in enough !Kong tribesmen and Mongolian sheepherders to round out our sample.  And even if we could somehow get all those folks, it would lead to the utter absence of most experimental effecss: the results of such disparate effects, for reasonable sample sizes, would look like noise.<p>Fine, you might say; you shouldn&#x27;t be doing science anyway, that&#x27;s the whole point -- it&#x27;s not science if you&#x27;re skewing your investigation so heavily.   But considering the logistical realities, and the cultural and institutional history that led to the emergence of an infrastructure for the pursuit of the scientific enterprise in the first place, it doesn&#x27;t seem so bad to have a body of &#x27;rigorous&#x27; knowledge that can then be amended, and indeed that is rigorous enough for its practitioners to realize, in response to surprises, that it ought to be amended.<p>To come back to the article, we have years of research on the ultimatum game where subject behavior under various manipulations has been carefully mapped out; and the existence of these precise results on this admittedly WEIRD dataset are why we can see departures from those results and take note of them; and think about how different cultural constructs might account for the violations of the model; and think about how we might adapt the model in response.<p>Put more briefly, having a lot of data on a small and unrepresentative population is a useful tool in the quest for building good models, so long as we realize, from time to time, the ways in which the models are inadequate.",1399045570

We&#x27;re still banging rocks together and amazed when occasionally there is a spark?<p>Look, Ruby and Python -- their implementations just plain suck. There, I said it. MRI and CPython are just a pile of crap. We&#x27;ve known since 1991-ish (see Self) how to make performant runtimes for dynamic languages and 23 years later Ruby and Python still have crappy slow interpreters with no useful concurrency support. Note that Ruby and Python were both started around about that time and are in fact older than Java. Sure the JVM team has a lot of resources, but other language implementations, such as Racket, don&#x27;t and they manage to solve these performance issues.<p>So let&#x27;s not get excited when a language implementation actually achieves a decent baseline of performance. Let&#x27;s expect that and move on.<p>Then there is Go&#x27;s woeful head-in-the-sand type system and its dumb approach to error handling. Errors values are logical ORs -- you can return a useful value OR an error. In Go they are ANDs -- you return a value (which may not be useful) AND an error. Just dumb. We&#x27;ve know how to do error handling without exceptions and without boiler plate since about 1991 (Wadler; monads). Generics since about 1985 (ML). Can we move on yet? Is a quarter-century long enough?<p>Oh, and channels? That&#x27;s Occam (1980s), if not earlier.<p>So what&#x27;s Go? A language with an implementation that&#x27;s not complete crap, and an inability to absorb ideas known for 25 or more years. I&#x27;m supposed to be excited that this will move our field forward?

There are a number of very well-designed languages on the horizon.

And many (most?) of the projects tagged <i>Groovy</i> on Github are triggered by a single Gradle build script for a project that uses some other language. These Gradle build scripts are often 30 lines long.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure how Groovy will fare in the future. Nothing seems to be taking its place, though, for testing and general manipulation of Java classes. Java and Scala are statically-compiled languages for building things, whereas dynamic Clojure seems to also be used for systems programming rather than scripting. I&#x27;m guessing Oracle will heavily promote Nashorn for scripting and JavaFX, but Javascript syntax doesn&#x27;t seem quite as full-featured as Groovy for now.",1399043600

7686137,comment,7685677,7685904,4,0,kordless,,,"> How could an attacker manipulate a URL to redirect somewhere else?<p>A site begins writing software to OAuth with Facebook.  They start by filling out a form on Facebook with app name and the callback URL to their site.  They then write a handler on their site for dealing with the callback URL they expect to receive from Facebook after the user approves the connection with their app.  However, the week before the company did OAuth integration, there was a ticket opened for &#x27;redirect user to correct page after login&#x27; which was implemented with a &#x27;?next=<a href=""http://urlofyourchosing.com/&#x27;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://urlofyourchosing.com/&#x27;</a> decorator handler written by the Swedish intern.<p>The redirect parameter isn&#x27;t going to be compared by Facebook.  Only the base URL is going to be checked to ensure it matches.<p>Once Oauth integration is complete and tested, the site launches.  They get on the front page of HN, Reddit and Mashable and sign up about 100K users in a few weeks.  In the meantime, a bad agent discovers the flaw in their login flow and tests the behavior and discovers the ?next redirect &#x27;venerability&#x27;.  They know the site uses Facebook, so they craft a URL to do OAuth with Facebook, then redirect the user to the attacking site by using the ?next parameter located in the third party&#x27;s website code.  They then use the current bad actor method of propagating their evil URLs and .... profit?<p>Impact: Any action by the user allowing access to data will, in theory, allow the attacker to view the information they gave the site access to and, possibly, more information than the user originally approved for the site if they accidently chose another security scope.  It should be noted that all access by the user to both Facebook and the attacked website will be logged by their respective servers.<p>I implemented an OAuth2 workflow with Github to an AppEngine project last year, so I&#x27;m at least passingly familiar with what goes on under the hood with the flows.  Still, I could be missing something here.  I might try to hack up a working example to test my theory.",1399043429

Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.<p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware.<p>We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.<p>Please note: this is a full-time, on-site position.

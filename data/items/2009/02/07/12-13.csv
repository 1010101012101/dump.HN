She says right at the beginning:<p>> I put 10% down and got a 5-year interest-only mortgage for about $576,000 [...]<p>That's a huge and leveraged to almost the maximum bet. We are all busted now just because of that crowd. And now we have to bail them out? (because it affects all of us, specially the savers as interest rates are practically zero.)",1234011378

471090,comment,470695,470764,0,0,lallysingh,,,"Agreed.  I wonder if there's a correlation between the rise of ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" and the shift from Sonatra to Britney Spears.  If the geniuses are entrepreneurs, who's left for the arts?<p>And the line between graduate school and consulting is getting <i>way</i> too thin.  One of my GRAs required that I spend time on-site with the customer -- sorry, ""corporate partner on the research grant.""",1234010782

471080,comment,470931,470931,0,0,sonink,,,"I think before you want to make something like a CL killer, you first need to understand what is CL, why is that so popular as it is -  essentially what is the primary driver of business for CL.<p>As other would have already commented, it seems that the simple interface is one of hte biggest drivers for CL. You would find the same if you dig through tons of forbes/media articles. I think that is not the case. That is just post-facto insight - something which gets generated a lot in the media.<p>The primary driver of business for CL afaik is data and the people who already use CL. If I want to sell something I go to CL because it offers me  the most amount of buyers. If I want to buy something vice-versa. It is a self-fulfilling loop.<p>The only way to beat CL is to figure out how do you overtake CL in its primary driver of business. It will not be easy - I dont know even if it is possible. But what I do know is that anything else (neat UI, AJAX) is just inconsequential.",1234009147

All your content is virtually invisible to google, and given that you're looking for ways to get traffic i would have thought natural search would have been very important.<p>I think you need to think a lot more about your urls - make them friendly for people and search engines, so instead of:<p><a href=""http://www.menkle.com/BrowseCategory.aspx?c=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menkle.com/BrowseCategory.aspx?c=3</a><p>why not:<p><a href=""http://www.menkle.com/categories/electronics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menkle.com/categories/electronics</a><p>and instead of:<p><a href=""http://www.menkle.com/ShowClassified.aspx?id=847"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menkle.com/ShowClassified.aspx?id=847</a><p>why not:<p><a href=""http://www.menkle.com/items/dvd/american_pie_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menkle.com/items/dvd/american_pie_2</a> or<p><a href=""http://www.menkle.com/washington/georgetown/dvd/american_pie_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menkle.com/washington/georgetown/dvd/american_pie...</a><p>some well thought out url rewriting will go a long way + will give the benefit of obscuring the fact you're using asp, which might help with security.",1234009004

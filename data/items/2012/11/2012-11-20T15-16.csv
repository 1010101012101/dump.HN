Its always seemed to me that they've tried hard to foster an image of a company that exists to serve the customer as best they can (though, sometimes they think they know best.)<p>It would seem to me that Apple would have the upper-hand in these negotiations. The carriers, at this point, need the iPhone. AT&T, and Verizon simply couldn't afford to not offer the iPhone anymore and expect customer retention/satisfaction. Why doesn't Apple throw their weight around and go to bat for the customer?<p>Is this some relic of a contractual obligation with AT&T? What part of this story am I missing?",1353427181

4809529,comment,4808685,4809296,6,0,trjordan,,,"From my intro-college-course understanding...<p>The problems they're solving are different. Patents exist to incentivize people to create new technology. If there were no patents, it's hard to justify spending lots of time and energy on new technology -- it'll just get stolen. So, the deal is that if you invent something, you get solid industrial use out of it (20 years sounds look enough to build a career), and in return, you publish comprehensive documentation about it. Contributing your knowledge to society is part of the deal.<p>Copyright is different. Copyrights are granted to unique, creative works -- art, that holds no value other than the value in the thing itself. There, there's nothing that would otherwise need to be hidden and protected to get use of the art. So, no need to publish docs, since you're exposing the whole thing when you disseminate anyway. But, it may be your life work, or something like that. So, you get protection from people ripping you off for your lifetime, plus long enough for people to forget about your person, leaving only the work.<p>Long story short, they're different processes with different societal impacts, so they get fundamentally different protections.",1353427140

I managed to avoid using pointers for that chunk of code.<p>For the DOM building portion, I need to allocate table and row objects while I'm getting events, and since I don't know ahead of time how many of each I'm going to have, I more-or-less must have a pointer to ""the current"" table, and then when that table is complete or I run out of document I can add it to the document object. So the lifespans are not identical anymore: the builder is going to have to allocate tables as it builds and probably rows as well.<p>At the moment I'm using pointers, and I just make a new table or row when appropriate and then add it back to the container. But this is a little messy because the containers are, you know, vector<table> and vector<row> and they don't need to think in terms of pointers for that reason. So I wind up passing <i>currentTable and </i>currentRow to the add methods, which probably makes copies on the stack.<p>I am sure that somebody with more C++ experience would see the right way to do this.

No, but any reasonable person (notice I keep using this phrase? It's going to come up in court) would assume if the lights are on and the door is open, you can walk in. You might be mistaken, and a clerk might show you out. Intent is a critical factor. Like I said, the guy went too far. He didn't enter by mistake, though someone could have.

Other scientists and commentators reviewed the report, with acknowledgment from the World Bank, and the bank expressed gratitude to the organization Connect4Climate for contributions to the production of the report.<p>The Ars Technica article summarizes the report as estimating that even if all countries are able to meet their current emissions pledges there's still a 20 percent chance global average temperatures will rise by 4C by the end of the century. Predicted sea level rise would be a half-meter or more.<p>Just last week here on HN another participant shared a speculative essay by science fiction author Charlie Stross on the world 500 years from now. Stross predicted sea-level rise of at least a meter, so I looked up sources about the effect of sea level rise. An interesting series of online maps shows projections of flooded land based on various degrees of sea level rise for places of interest such as New York City,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/new-york.shtml</a><p>San Francisco,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/san-francisco.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/san-francisco.shtml</a><p>the Netherlands and England,<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/netherlands.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/netherlands.shtml</a><p>and Chesapeake Bay.<p><a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/washington.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/washington.shtml</a><p>In all cases, the maps default to showing seven meters of sea level rise and do not project any civil engineering projects to protect existing infrastructure. Having read Matt Ridley's blog post ""Go Dutch""<p><a href=""http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/go-dutch.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rationaloptimist.com/blog/go-dutch.aspx</a><p>back when it was published, I wonder if the most dire predictions about the Netherlands are true, or if the Netherlands, the land of polders,<p><a href=""http://static.nai.nl/polders/e/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.nai.nl/polders/e/index.html</a><p>can continue to be ""living proof to climate pessimists that dwelling below sea level is no problem if you are prosperous.""<p>The report continues with dire predictions of hot summers and changes in rainfall. ""It is my hope that this report shocks us into action,"" is World Bank President Jim Yong Kim's statement about the report. ""Even for those of us already committed to fighting climate change, I hope it causes us to work with much more urgency.""<p>I fully agree with the premise that there will continued widespread use of fossil hydrocarbon fuels for electricity generation, transportation, and building heating. There are no effective incentives in place today, nor any likely in the next few decades, to prevent further consumption of fossil hydrocarbons, and that will surely result in a substantial increase in atmospheric concentration in CO2.<p>Predicting climate change is a safe prediction any time, because over 100 year and especially 500 year time scales, we have often observed climate change in historic times. Over longer time scales, but since Homo sapiens populated much of the earth, rock art in the Sahara Desert shows that the Sahara was once much less arid than it is now, and cave art in Europe shows that the climate of Europe was once much more frigid than it is now.<p>I live in the United States Midwest, and my mother grew up in a hotter part of the United States Midwest during the Dust Bowl era. Most of her family is still near the family farm on the windswept Great Plains. I don't expect any part of the earth to become uninhabitably hot. We have, according to the best developed models of influences on world climate, a sure prospect of a generally warmer Earth, warming currently lethally cold areas into areas that will be habitable. My experience living in subtropical east Asia in two long stays about two decades apart suggests that we will have more warming of cold areas than turning hot areas into unbearably hot areas from global warming.<p>Despite the dire predictions in the World Bank report, it is not necessarily the case that port cities will be inundated even by more substantial sea level rise than is anticipated by the report. New York City is sufficiently prosperous to attract some of the world's brightest minds to live there (I know some young people who have moved there recently) and the current city administration actively encourages making New York City a technology hub. New York will thrive, whatever the climate.<p><a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/11/new-york-can-be-a-vibrant-venice-as-sea-level-now-rises-say-engineers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/11/new-york-can-...</a><p>Venice and New Orleans have been in long-term decline for quite a while, from bad governance, and will surely suffer further relative decline, regardless of sea levels. There will still be a great port at the mouth of the Mississippi-Missouri river system, and it will be a thriving and cosmopolitan city, but it may well be in a different place along the river delta from the current location of New Orleans. Venice may basically vanish, but current ports that matter for the world economy will gain the infrastructure investment to build up protection against the sea faster than the sea will rise.<p>There is much more interesting content in the long World Bank report referenced in the submitted article, but allow me to explain why I think the high end of global warming predictions (and thus the high end of sea level rise and climate pattern change predictions) is unlikely. We already have a known model for induced global cooling from the ""natural experiment"" of volcanos erupting and ejecting much dust high into the atmosphere. If the climate change we now experience produces more pain than gain (where I live, at 800 feet above sea level in a continental dry, cold winter climate zone, global warming has so far mostly produced gain), then there will be political and economic incentives to sequester greenhouse gases, or directly shade the Earth with high-altitude dust, or to do whatever else science discovers to slow and perhaps eventually reverse global warming. The end of the century is about eighty-eight years from now, and surely our understanding of climate models and geoengineering possibilities will be stronger then than it is now. Over the time span of the report, I would expect enough of an increase in understanding of climate models to bring about workable means to moderate global warming and shape climate change in the direction of making most inhabited regions better off.",1353425513

Mine clearance teams in Afghanistan report finding literally dozens of types of landmines, mainly from the ex-USSR, but also from Belgium, Italy, US and the UK. The most infamous mine used during the Soviet Union's occupation period was the so-called 'butterfly' mine. Helicopter crews dropped untold numbers (figures range into the millions) of the small mines from the air.<p>Also, I found this interesting.  Clearly, it's not enough to demine the world, but it's more than the zero dollar amount you basically assume:
[2] Despite its refusal to join the treaty, the U.S. has done more to counteract mines than any other country, spending $1.9 billion during the past 18 years through the Humanitarian Mine Action Programroughly a quarter of the total spent on demining and other remediation activities around the world. There's been a special emphasis on helping Cambodia, which has received more than $80 million since 1993.<p>Reason for not signing treaty isn't too great, but there is hope:
[2] The American position is complicated. The United States has not used antipersonnel land mines since 1991, not exported them since 1992, and not produced them since 1997. But the nation has a stockpile of some 10 million land mines, and prior to the '90s, it exported 4.4 million antipersonnel land mines, an unknown number of which are still in the ground.
...
Nonetheless, under pressure from the United States Campaign to Ban Landmines, the Obama Administration has been conducting a comprehensive review of its land mine policy.<p>4.4 million exported, not clear if that includes how many they planted.  This seems like it must be the majority, but it turns out there are an estimated 110 million planted in the world [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afghan-network.net/Landmines/</a>

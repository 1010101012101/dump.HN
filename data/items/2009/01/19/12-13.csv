440404,comment,440348,440348,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Being on top of the JVM is also one of the really nice things about Rhino (Mozilla's JVM based JavaScript interpreter: <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/</a>). You have access to a zillion Java libraries. Taking two of their examples:<p>MySQL:<p><pre><code>    var conn = java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(""jdbc:mysql://""+host+""/""+db+""?user=""+user+""&password=""+password),\n        statement = conn.createStatement(),\n        resultset = statement.executeQuery(""SELECT * FROM test"");\n        // do stuff!\n\n</code></pre>\nJetty also works from Rhino:<p><pre><code>    var server = new Packages.org.mortbay.jetty.Server(8080);\n\n    server.setHandler(new Packages.org.mortbay.jetty.handler.AbstractHandler({\n        handle: function(target, request, response, dispatch){\n            // do stuff!\n            request.setHandled(true);\n        }\n    }));\n    server.start();\n</code></pre>\nObviously these could be wrapped up in more JavaScripty libraries, but all the hard work is done for you.",1232369854
440403,comment,440124,440244,0,0,noonespecial,,,"I kind of looks like circuit city isn't doing it this way either, but you can never be too sure. Usually the liquidators either hire on some of the old staff, or dress their people in the stores old uniforms. The best way to tell is to find an item you <i>know</i> was $100 last week, marked $199 and then discounted 50% off.<p>One things usually certain though. Its not an <i>everything must go!!!</i> sale like you are lead to believe. They're more than happy to truck all the good stuff off and sell it elsewhere if they think they're not going to get near retail for it during the ""sale"".<p>Think of it like one last ""President's Day Blowout!"" before the parking lot starts growing weeds.",1232369753

440401,comment,440348,440348,0,0,jwilliams,,,"This might be a good experiment, but the examples seem a bit flimsy to me.<p>For example - Whilst it may well be better from his experience, Timestamp has always been an anomaly in Java (it doesn't necessarily play nicely with Date)....<p>Equally I've never found browsing the filesystem that superb in Java - in fact the whole FileFilter, FilenameFilter thing can be quite clunky to use... It's one area where I've never felt more than a smidgen away from C (even moreso now with the NIO library).<p>So - maybe better, certainly not perfect - Either way they didn't on the weight of it seem killer arguments.",1232369553
440400,comment,439562,439562,0,0,Goladus,,,"I don't like white <i>or</i> black backgrounds, though I prefer white to black in a typical windowed environment.  If my editor has the full screen it doesn't matter, but I don't like menus and other windows being a lot brighter than the editor.  It's either distracting, or it's a jarring readjustment every time I have to change windows.<p>If it weren't for syntax highlighting, I'd prefer slight color variations, with not much preference towards dark-on-light or light-on-dark.  If I have a lighter background I usually prefer the text to be black.  If I have a darker background I usually prefer the text to be slightly colored.  In web terms, an example would be ""99DD99"" text on ""303030"" background, or ""99DD99"" background with black text.",1232369235

440389,comment,439822,440161,0,0,djm,,,"I first started programming with C and had a terrible time. I didn't really get anywhere and went through a cycle of repeatedly giving up and them returning to it after having a break.<p>I don't think it's a good way to start programming but I would encourage people to learn it at some point because of the reason you gave.<p>I'd also suggest that the best way to get to grips with C is to learn assembly with a simple processor at the same time. People always seem to get stuck on pointers etc and that's easy to understand when you know a processor's addressing modes. Plus, it's always fun to use gcc to output (unoptimized) assembly code and compare it to what you would have written.",1232367927

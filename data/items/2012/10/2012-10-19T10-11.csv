It may, however require you to install your language specific plugins. Vim ships with C and C++ mode, which requires you to build a ctags database of your source code. In addition you might want to add cscope for source code navigation.<p>Eclipse has autocomplete perhaps for a handful of languages but Vim has support for autocompletion in tons of languages.<p>In addition to omni-complete, vim can have an user defined completion (C-x C-u), which is handy to set to do syntax completion (set completefunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete). Vim ships with tons of syntax files, which are used for completion and syntax highlighting. This is not super useful for programming, but is excellent for different kinds of configuration files, so you don't have to memorize (or look in the manual) for the configuration options you use.<p>And I'd rather use Vim without autocomplete than have to deal with Eclipse. Thankfully I don't have to.<p>Emacs has great autocomplete too.",1350643708

To be more explicit; I assume absent extremely syrong evidence that people and institutions  rarely follow a pattern of pissing off those upon whom their livelihoods depend. There's a great Upton Sinclair quote to that effect but I'm on my phone. Again, who pays the piper calls the tune. Not saying there's a cabal deciding all this but ideologies need not be explicit to have power.<p>On an unrelated note, I don't expect to change your mind and while I'd be glad if you were to cede the point I do not argue with that aim in mind. Expecting to change your interlocutor's mind when you argue on the internet is the mark of a fool. This isn't lesswrong; most commenters aim to win arguments, not mote closely approach the truth. Arguing on the internet is for the rraders, the audience.<p>tokenadult will not be convinced by yummyfajitas that the US education system is excellent but every time he disses it yummyfajitas brings up the same excellent argument and tokenadult refuses to engage with it and makes ad hominem attacks and appeals to authority.

Common Lisp, for example, has no need of the visitor pattern since it has multiple dispatch.<p>The O.P. is about when the design patterns are <i>needed,</i> not what you need to implement them.<p>Incidentally, the visitor pattern doesn't require OO for implementation, it requires a type system and single dispatch, i.e. choosing a method based on the run-time type of its first argument.  Python doesn't have single dispatch.  So the visitor pattern doesn't really work in Python, you essentially have to code a huge number of branches, e.g. n switch statements, each with n cases, in order to dispatch n^2 ways.",1350643161

4672913,comment,4672601,4672870,0,0,lutusp,,,"> You're confused about the meaning of almost surely ...<p>Yes, but I'm not the only one. I think most people who read the justification for describing p = 1.0 as ""almost surely"" will have the same reaction, regardless of their training. Not to argue that logic must accept responsibility for our confusion.<p>> your comparison with dollars and pregnancy is misleading.<p>As to dollars, yes (because it's finite and trivial), but as to the parturient state of a set of women, it depends on the size of the set. For an infinite set of women, to describe them all as almost surely pregnant (or not), is a reasonable corollary to describing p = 1.0 as ""almost surely"" in the general case.<p>> Indeed, there are infinitely many non normal numbers (for example, every integer is obviously not normal), even though the probability that a number is not normal is 0.<p>This compares two infinite sets and draws a conclusion based on the outcome (the set of integers is infinite in size, and the set of numbers (reals and integers) is also infinite in size). I'm not sure this is comparable to making a statement about the mapping of a single well-defined probability (for example the appearance of War and Peace) into a single infinite set, like the presumed infinite set of the digits of Pi.<p>Which leads to an obvious question -- does the ""almost surely"" qualifier apply to all p = 1.0 probabilities, or only a subset? In other words, does the qualifier depend on the construction of the probability, or does it always apply?",1350641788

4672902,comment,4672809,4672809,2,0,haxplorer,,,"It is a very healthy business model. Since repeated transactions are kind of guaranteed to happen, the company could spend confidently on acquiring new customers. They don't have to spend time and again on the same customer to acquire newer transactions from them.<p>Here is how most non-subscription based e-commerce companies today work:
The company shows some traction, gets good funding, acquires customers at a cost higher than the value of the current transaction, with the hope that the customer would later come back to buy more, and the company could recover the acquisition cost over time, and make profits. But every other competitor in the space is doing the same, and the customers have multiple places to buy from. So, the company ends up acquiring the same customer time and again, and all these costs get added up to the customer acquisition cost. But in the early stages, the lifetime value of the customer wouldn't be evident, and the company might end up spending lot more than the lifetime value to acquire transactions in the short term.<p>This problem doesn't happen with subscription based e-commerce companies, as long as they provide a good service and are able to retain the subscriptions. They could pay for advertisements on a cost per acquisition model, and count only new customer acquisitions, and subscription upgrades are conversions. This way their customer acquisition cost would be constant and under control.<p>Here are some of the areas where subscription based e-commerce would work well:
1) Groceries, fruits and vegetables
2) Cosmetics and sanitary products - Facial creams, lipsticks, skin care products, after shave lotion, shaving foam, kitchen napkins, toilet papers, sanitary napkins & tampons, condoms, cleaning agents, detergents, etc.
3) Baby products - diapers, baby oil, talc, etc.
4) Medicines - Diabetic, blood pressure control, cancer drugs, etc. - But there are regulatory concerns here
5) Undergarments, socks, etc.<p>Most of this is already being done by some company or the other.",1350641374

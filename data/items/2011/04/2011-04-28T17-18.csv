2494305,comment,2493319,2493319,2,0,veidr,,,"Workflows vary, of course. And yeah, for non-programmers, I think the Air is a great machine--good enough to be the primary machine for most people.<p>But for full-time programming work, I think it is <i>absolutely</i> <i>fucking</i> <i>batshit</i> <i>insane</i> to use anything less than a modern 12-core Mac Pro with 32 GB RAM and an SSD RAID boot volume (at which point multiple 2560 x something monitors are <i>de</i> <i>rigueur</i>).<p>That's certainly true for [Obj-]C[++] development, where large compiles <i>still</i> take minutes, even on such hardware--and can take an entire lunch break on the Air.<p>Obj-C coding is my primary background, so buying the fastest possible machine every year has always made sense in that way; perhaps I have a leftover cognitive bias toward buying the fastest possible machine. But, for the past year or so, I've been working mainly with Ruby and Objective-J, which don't have these burdensome compiles. Yet buying the fastest mainstream hardware still makes tons of sense to me.<p>Running a few hundred unit tests, one second is way better than eight seconds. Running a bunch of convoluted RSpec integration specs, 34 seconds is way, way better than seven minutes. And although I mainly use simple editors like MacVim and BBEdit, I also really like the psychotron-dynamic-heuristic CodeSense-style introspection-based context-aware autocompletion features of RubyMine--a heavyweight Java-based IDE that eats 800MB of RAM and can barely even launch on a MacBook Air, and certainly isn't usable on it. And of course the modern Pro can run Win7, WinXP, and Linux in VMWare in the background without breaking a sweat (that's why 16GB RAM doesn't really suffice).<p>Don't get me wrong; I think the recent MacBook Air is awesome. I have one, that I use for... well basically for word processing on airplanes (haha). And whatever else on airplanes.<p>But for working programmers, I think computers are still not nearly 'powerful enough'--there are still huge gains to be had by getting the fastest machine that it is reasonably possible to buy.<p>For roughly the price of one decently tricked-out Mac Pro, you can buy ten MacBook Airs. And for roughly the price of ten decently tricked-out Mac Pros, you can hire one additional developer.<p>That notwithstanding, I still think it makes business sense.<p>Sometimes, in my dreams, an AI built by an alien race visits my house, from the future in another galaxy, and explains to me the precise opportunity cost of a dozen human developers waiting three or four extra seconds, a hundred times a day for a year... and it's more than the ten grand that an appropriately provisioned Mac Pro costs<p>P.S.
A bootstrapped startup where money is really tight is the obvious exception--the exception that proves the rule!",1304013528

With the Mac, you are buying some brand, some better construction, and a lot of better customer service. You are also buying OS X, which may or may not be attractive.<p>I used Linux for many years as a primary development machine, and it was great. Ubuntu is doing a good job solving the ""there is no good desktop for Linux"" that was pretty true five years ago.<p>That said, I prefer my Mac because I get almost the same ability to play at the command line (I spend most of my day in Emacs right now, including running my shells there), but I also get a refined experience when I'm interacting with applications outside of development (e.g. Garage Band, Pages, Keynote, etc).<p>In the end, I didn't switch for development, I switched for all the time I use my laptop when I'm not developing. For me, it was worth it, but YMMV.",1304013399

In fact, I would never have used it if I hadn't used the free app.<p>I know I'm in a minority of users, but I still think the free is useful.<p>Having initially spent many months using my iPhone and not paying for any apps at all (only downloading free apps), I took my first step into paid apps with a cheap $0.99 app, and realized that for the small price, it made my app (and phone) experience a whole lot better. After that, I was always willing to spend money on apps (even if it was just for experimentation) and Instapaper became one of the first apps I bought.<p>I don't know if this is an unusual thing, but I've noticed a lot of my friends act in a similar manner. After paying for that first app, they are very willing to pay for more. And you'd be losing some very good customers if you removed the free app.<p>I suppose I understand Marco's decision even after all this, I'm still unhappy that we might see it go.",1304010382

It came at the right time to help people deal with the limitations of a mobile device, but the app itself is trivial. The model is trivial. The web service is, I would wager, trivial.<p>It is entirely normal, but happened at exactly the right time.<p>I'm not a big fan of Marcos because I read a sense of desperation in virtually all he has said lately (just look through his recent archives and you'll see someone tilting into the wind). Further isn't it a bit ridiculous for someone to have gotten big on the backs of a free app to then -- after they've established the network effect and have market presence -- proclaim that free apps aren't necessary?<p>It's a lesson with no meat at all. If this app started at $4.99 and became as popular as it is, then you'd have a story. Otherwise honestly it reads more like an attempt at misdirection for people who might follow.",1304010352

But it built its popularity while charging a lot for an iPhone app from the start.""<p>AND there was a free version out.<p>He's neglecting the ""critical mass"" factor.<p>The free version helped him sell the full version until it reached that ""critical mass"" that was required for the popularity of the full version to continue to drive sales of itself.<p>I've personally found that by just offering a paid version of an app from the beginning is quite frustrating.  But once I put out a free limited version, sales took off.  So, MAYBE I'll try losing some of my free versions to see what happens, but I think that free-to-paid actually works just as well.",1304010319

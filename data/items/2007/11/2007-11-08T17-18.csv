77533,comment,77478,77478,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I've been thinking a lot about the 10x rule recently. There was a post on YCnews a few weeks ago suggesting that the real success rate was much closr to 50%.<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74562</a><p>At a panel of Boston-area VCs I attended, each of them said they had no idea where the mythical 10x number came from and that their success rate was closer to 50-90%. I seem to remember YC suggesting the sucess rate was much higher than 10%.<p>Granted a lot of these 'successes' are companies that are barely managing to stay in business...but they haven't gone bust either. Maybe a better way to look at the situation is that the VCs want to keep as many companies above water as possible in hopes that some smaller percentage will be a huge hit.<p>Bottom line, I don't think the goals of VCs and entrepeneurs are really as divergent as the 10x factor suggests.",1194544374

77525,story,,,232,38,fauigerzigerk,"Number of founders - statistics",,"I've done some research on how many founders successful technology companies have. Here are the numbers for 100 publicly traded companies<p><pre><code> +--------------------+-----------+

Some caveats<p>The number of sole founder companies is probably slightly exaggerated because sometimes one person is so much more prominent that the others are never mentioned. I did a little double checking though. Another important thing is that some companies were omitted because I knew only that they had several founders but I wasn't able to find out exactly how many. I suspect there are more companies with 4, 5, 6 or more founders.<p>Unfortunately without numbers about failed companies we still don't know the success ratio of each frequency group, which is what's most interesting for startup founders here. It is well possible that sole founders fail 10 times as often as 2 founder companies, or vice versa.

I had zero experience interviewing as a woman, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I passed, so I figured it was safer to continue working for the same company I transitioned at. The logic was &quot;they know me, they knew me before transition, they know I&#x27;ve only been living as a woman less than a year, and I already know they don&#x27;t care, so I might as well take the safe option and stick with them rather than risk freaking an interviewer out with my voice or accidentally wear something a woman shouldn&#x27;t wear to an interview&quot;.<p>Mind you, my employer at the time wasn&#x27;t great. I was underpaid (75% market value in pure salary, plus I got no insurance whatsoever), my boss couldn&#x27;t handle stress and took it out by screaming at his subordinates, software engineering leadership was absolutely terrible for multiple reasons (I and others tried to change it, and we were rebuffed, so the people I worked best with quit in frustration one by one), and I had a months-long nightmare involving the building management discriminating against me where my employer offered me almost no support (it only ended when I got the city involved). There were a number of other minor concerns as well, but these were the big ones.<p>During the worst of the discrimination, the owner/CEO promised me a bonus if I stuck around until our next product entered production. Production was delayed by two months from what was originally planned, and even then getting him to actually keep his promise was like pulling teeth, though I eventually got it. Somehow, I ended up staying on even after that, though I should&#x27;ve probably at least started applying for jobs once the bonus cleared my bank account.<p>It took way, way too long for me to accept that I needed to find a new job. Ultimately, after a particularly bad incident of my boss taking his stress out on me, I finally got up the courage to put myself out there, I got a wonderful new job, and I&#x27;m more than happy with my current employer.<p>In the long run, the devil you know is the worse devil.",1440009988

I highly doubt there is any kind of sensation or consciousness inside of the brain models, seeing as how they have no sensory inputs or organic energy inputs (especially oxygen) whatsoever. On top of that, even 5 week old fetuses (which these model brains are definitively not) aren&#x27;t remotely viable or sensate anyway, and don&#x27;t even have an associated behavior model AFAIK.<p>The ethical boundaries for experimenting on living mice are, in my opinion, a bit perverse at the extremes. There&#x27;s a general consensus that mice are sensate and can experience in some form basic emotions and learning behaviors. Despite this, it&#x27;s acceptable to do experiments which deplete or wildly manipulate various neurotransmitters or neural circuits inside of the mouse&#x27;s brain far beyond normal physiology.<p>Imagine having 100% of the &quot;feel good&quot; chemicals removed from your brain and replaced with 10,000% the normal concentration of &quot;feel bad&quot; chemicals. Obviously this is a huge simplification, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that it would be hellish-- and that experiment has actually been done using mice. Sure, it&#x27;s not as bad as if it were done with a real person, but it&#x27;d be much better if we could spare the mice and use a model brain in a vat instead.",1440009530

Cheap scales can&#x27;t normally do bellow twenty mg, and anything over 5mg can&#x27;t fit on blotter. 3-meo-PCP doses between those two.<p>N2O - does work for depression, sort of.

You rely on reputation and the crazy people who test these things.<p>This whole process started for me when a dose of ketamine basically transformed me from suicidally depressed to fairly normal and functional in one use.

Let&#x27;s see the methods paper they used to produce this model, then let&#x27;s see the independent validation papers which would show us that the model is accurate in compared to previously established information. Then let&#x27;s see an independently authored paper on a unique speculative use of this model that has positive results.<p>This model is in its infancy. It still needs a lot of experimental work (5 years? 10 years?) and in general the more complex models take a longer amount of time to be validated and widely trusted. A great example is the humanized mouse model, which is super complex (though not as complex as a brain) and took somewhere between 3 and 10 years depending on who you ask to go from the point of the OP model to mainstream accepted usage for some purposes. Maybe 5 years down the line we&#x27;ll see something come out of the new brain model.<p>Brain science isn&#x27;t my expertise, but there&#x27;s a couple of other tidbits that caught my attention about this model. First, its vascular structure is missing entirely. I&#x27;m guessing the level of oxygenation of the fetal brain is important, but there may be ways of controlling for this gap. Second, gene expression isn&#x27;t 100% equivalent to an actual human fetal brain at this level of development. There are probably ways to control for this also, but it&#x27;s still a flaw. We don&#x27;t expect models to be 100% true to reality (after all, it&#x27;s a model), so I expect that these holes aren&#x27;t going to prevent this model from being successful and useful.",1440008754

It&#x27;s pretty popular in the house/techno music scene, along with MDMA, LSD, and mushrooms.<p>At &quot;micro doses,&quot; you just feel like you&#x27;re in a really great mood--not really inebriated at all.<p>At low doses, it makes me feel very &quot;silly.&quot; It&#x27;s very fun to do with friends. You&#x27;re all cracking jokes, laughing, making fun, dancing around. It&#x27;s a dissociative, so it makes moving around and walking feel funny and novel. At low doses you are quite functional, though.<p>Normally, I might have a tinge of social anxiety, and be on the more shy or reserved end of the spectrum. More than any other drug (including MDMA and alcohol), ketamine completely does away with any anxiety. I presume this is what makes it therapeutic. All worries are gone...you feel light-hearted and whimsical.<p>At higher doses, the dissociative effect is stronger. This induces what is known as the &quot;K hole.&quot; Ketamine is indeed a usable (and comparatively safe) anesthetic.<p>You come down after 40-60 minutes. There isn&#x27;t any negative comedown effect...more of an afterglow. At this point, you can do some more and go right back up. Keep on doing this, however, and you <i>will</i> generate a short-term tolerance.<p>Ketamine is often diverted from veterinary supplies. You will get a liquid vial, which you can then heat up to dry it out into a powder. This is the best quality K you could hope to find. If you get it in powder form, it is likely to be cut with something...who knows what.<p><a href=""https://dancesafe.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dancesafe.org/</a> is an organization that will test your drugs for you at an event.

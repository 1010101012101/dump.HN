For low exposures the best solution is to avoid or remove the source of the exposure.<p>Quoting from <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846980/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3846980/</a> (italics mine):<p>> <i>Chelation treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients is unlikely to benefit patients and may actually cause harm</i>, as discussed elsewhere in this publication. Patients seek clear cause–effect relationships for their “poisoning,” but it is not always possible to determine the cause of symptoms. Physicians should seek a thorough diagnosis in spite of the pressure to find a simple environmental culprit. Internet advertising by marketers of “toxic testings” have made testing and treatment popular in some alternative medicine practices and has encouraged some people with health problems to seek these treatments. However, it is not possible to remove all “toxins” from the body, and treatments remove essential elements as well. Furthermore, <i>the efficacy of chelation treatment has not been generally demonstrated for all but severe recent acute exposures to a few metals</i>. In addition to concerns about short-term adverse impacts that may result from chelation, public health practitioners are also concerned about the potential subtle and latent effects that have not been characterized.<p>> In responding to citizen’s requests for information, public health officials are often confronted by extremely emotional appeals to solve personal health problems. Commercial laboratory marketings “toxin testing” offer hope that there is another treatment option. They also appear to prey on the guilt of caregivers, suggesting that not every treatment option has been tried until chelation products are used. However, no assessment of the true risks and benefits of chelation treatments are being provided.",1417863342

8708911,comment,8705630,8708859,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Using floor it seems like you can construct a function that&#x27;s effectively defined piecewise, by constructing a floor expression that&#x27;s zero outside of a specified input domain, and 1 within the domain. Then you multiply the floor expression by the piecewise expression that you&#x27;d use to define a piecewise function over that domain.<p>And you can fit a polynomial the same way by (using the example at hand) defining<p><pre><code>    f(x) =  c_1(x-2)(x-3)...(x-12)
         +  c_2(x-1)(x-3)...(x-12)
         +  c_3(x-1)(x-2)...(x-12) [but the (x-3) factor is missing!]
         +  .      .            .

         + c_12(x-1)(x-2)...(x-11)
</code></pre>
And then choosing c_1 such that the c_1 term is equal to 31 when x=1, c_2 such that the c_2 term is equal to 28 when x=2, and so forth. You&#x27;ll get a well-defined polynomial, impeccably &quot;mathematical&quot; -- in fact, you should get the polynomial listed in Someone&#x27;s comment (since there should only be one 11th-degree polynomial passing through those 12 points). The traditional way to fit a polynomial to points is by reducing a matrix, linear-algebra style, but this approach is equivalent and, as you can see, amounts to nothing more than defining several functions which are zero except at the point of interest, and then scaling them to take the proper value at the point of interest. Why is that more &quot;valid&quot; than using a modulus?<p>Frankly, I&#x27;m much more concerned by the OP using &quot;2 mod x&quot; when 1 is a legal value for x.",1417862767

The cache exhaustion argument was .. odd. As I recall the cache entry was created on handshake and was keyed off of src ip, dst IP, dst port. Given that the attacker can (effectively) only vary the src ip thats a <i>lot</i> of addresses to control. The other argument was that not hitting a cache was &quot;only&quot; 10% slower in microbenchmarks.<p>Personally Im dubious of the route cache removal, though I havent tested. The 10% hit rate, as I recall, was from Google front end servers which Id expect to have a high cardinality of peers along with a simplistic route table. For servers with multiple interfaces, variable route properties, multiple tables, etc and a high packet rate a fast cache should be quite valuable.",1417862442

I&#x27;m sure that .Net web apps will still be deployed to IIS when they need to scale a lot, and are hosted on windows, but neither of those two are mandatory any more. A lot of sites and web services won&#x27;t need all that and can use a self-host or lightweight host. OR new hosts/adapters to other web servers can be written. There&#x27;s a lot more hosting and platform flexibility coming, which is exciting.<p>For more info, see<p><a href=""http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/aspnet-5-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-vnext/aspnet-5-over...</a><p><a href=""http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana/getting-started-with-owin-and-katana"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/owin-and-katana/getting-s...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer</a>",1417860658

8708859,comment,8705630,8707548,0,0,jcrites,,,"> In my mind using modulus and floor in a mathematical formula is no more valid than using cases<p>Agreed. Using floor it seems like you can construct a function that&#x27;s effectively defined piecewise, by constructing a floor expression that&#x27;s zero outside of a specified input domain, and 1 within the domain. Then you multiply the floor expression by the piecewise expression that you&#x27;d use to define a piecewise function over that domain.<p>Nevertheless I found the article to be an interesting read on mathematical reasoning - a thought process for designing functions with particular behavior. Is there a rigorous way of describing why mod and floor seem like cheating in a way, aside from the fact that they can be used to construct piecewise functions? Is the ideal hack in this scenario a continuous, smooth function? (And something more interesting than the result of polynomial interpolation?)",1417860602

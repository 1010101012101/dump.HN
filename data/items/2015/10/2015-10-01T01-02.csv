After three years while your peers finishing up at university you will have a solid work history with great qualifications with no debt. You can even get a degree if you join ACCA for just ₤200 for submitting a thesis and no additional exams.<p>While in the US, to become a CPA, you would need masters level education in most cases to even appear for the CPA exams. UK and almost all commonwealth countries have programs and institutes that offer professional qualification opportunities with even more prestige than the average university route. Accountancy is one of the few fields where one can  get-qualified-on-job in the Anglosphere (US, Canada excluded).<p>ICAEW : <a href=""http://careers.icaew.com/school-students-leavers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://careers.icaew.com/school-students-leavers</a><p>ACCA  : <a href=""http://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/qualifications/accountancy-career/ukschoolleaver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accaglobal.com/uk/en/qualifications/accountancy-c...</a><p>ACCA + B.Sc (Hons.) :<a href=""http://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/help/oxford-brookes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/help/oxford-brookes.html</a>",1443664792

To hit these numbers would require the present revolution in capabilities in biotechnology to produce pretty much nothing of practical use. It would require the present sea change in the aging research and broader medical community in attitudes towards aging, the growing advocacy among researchers to treat aging as a medical condition (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468941/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4468941/</a> ), and greater funding directed specifically at the production of ways to treat aging, all of that to go nowhere.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is realistic. There are startups now working on ways to repair the specific known causes of aging, forms of damage that contribute to a wide range of age-related disease. Oisin Biotech for senescent cell clearance, Human Rejuvenation Technologies for clearance of metabolic waste that contributes to atherosclerosis among other conditions, Gensight for mitochondrial DNA repair, and so forth. Is all this really going to go nowhere, have no real impact on the present very gentle upward slope in life expectancy?<p>Betting against leaps in technology progress doesn&#x27;t seem a winning choice given the past 150 years and the present environment especially.",1443664787

It&#x27;s usually referring to Europe, Australia, and Canada. Sometimes Japan. What&#x27;s left out is that most of those countries are economically stagnant, have massive youth unemployment, and exercise almost no international influence.  The West has been in a rut for a couple of decades and the US is actually the shining star of the bunch.  We have the most productive, most innovative, and most dynamic economy of all of these countries.  We are wealthier per capita than pretty much all of them, save for a couple city-states and oil-rich countries.  Let&#x27;s keep that in mind when we use this &quot;every other advanced country&quot; meme.<p>By centralizing all procurement of a drug for an entire country through a single contract, of course countries are able to negotiate better prices than what Americans pay in a more free market.  This is especially true given the structure of the pharma business, with massive up-front costs and almost-zero marginal costs.  You could do the same with countless products.  But this is it&#x27;s own kind of abuse.  Instead of being paid the market price, pharma companies are paid the lowest-price they could absolutely tolerate.  They also have to worry about the political fallout of walking away from a deal when the cheap-skating government tries to blame them for the lack of a deal.<p>There&#x27;s definitely ways in which drug pricing can become abusive and needs to be regulated, especially because government intervention via patents is partially responsible for enabling these abuses.  But let&#x27;s not throw out the baby with the bath water.  A free market for drugs makes sure that companies can recoup their investments and make a reasonable profit.  If pharma companies don&#x27;t feel that they can do that, they won&#x27;t invest in new drugs.  Also, I don&#x27;t want to live in a place where the availability of a treatment is determined by some government committee that determines what the value of a month of my life is.<p>A final thought, sticker prices for drugs are thrown around as evidence that drugs are overpriced, but 1) no one ever pays the sticker price, it&#x27;s always negotiated way down and 2) these drugs provide immense value.  Antiretroviral drugs, for example, turn HIV from an imminent death sentence into a very manageable disease like diabetes.  Thousands of dollars a month is pretty reasonable when you consider that.",1443663622

People with college degrees start unnecessary wars. People with college degrees ruin economies with finance schemes designed for maximum personal profit over the interest in a healthy society. People with college degrees beat their partners and children. People with college degrees abuse substances, and they fall prey to the ravages of induced mental health issues and poor physical health choices like obesity or sedentary lifestyles.<p>In addition I&#x27;ve found many Americans with college degrees to be incurious about the world outside their own life and often outright hostile to intellectualism.<p>Not all people with college degrees are like this of course, but enough to make me think that if #2 is an intended and assumed function of post-secondary education then these institutions are not very effective in that mission when you compare the credentialed population with the rest of us.<p>And yes, I have no college degree. Despite high-test scores, AP credit in math, sciences, history and English, sports and other activities I was only accepted to my State Schools&#x27; Engineering program out of my applications, and only begrudgingly, which meant I had to actually write a lett er to the Dean&#x27;s office about how very very much I wanted to be an Engineer. When I got there I realized how much of the &#x27;education&#x27; offered was ridiculous nonsense. I had to drop out after a year to attend to some family issues and was forced to enter the workforce immediately doing tech support and clawed my way into professional software development.<p>It&#x27;s been a struggle most of the time not having a degree I can simply point to, but that&#x27;s been mostly due to having to overcome the biases of the credentialed versus those of us with no formal credentials.

In fact, it&#x27;s a very short step from there to pantheism (everything is God).<p>And in fact, God (the theistic version) would explain this perfectly.  Drop your materialistic assumptions for a moment, and hear me out.  If God exists, as a being with consciousness and personality, and if he created humans &quot;in his own image&quot;, then we are not faced with the Hard Problem of Consciousness.  Humans can then be truly conscious, and have true personality, without those things being just a configuration of atoms.<p>The pantheistic version of God doesn&#x27;t work as well, because it&#x27;s ultimately impersonal (despite the &quot;theistic&quot; part of the word).

But I&#x27;m saying that when a particular provider is sufficiently powerful, they have the capability to make those options less appealing, either malevolently or inadvertently.<p>You could move your open source project away from GitHub, but if GitHub is sufficiently popular that most people don&#x27;t understand how the patch system works in git, and hence don&#x27;t know how to contribute without using the affordances that GitHub offers, then you will incur a cost by doing so.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that if the majority of people using a decentralized system via a centralized wrapper, and if interaction with those people is a priority, then it is possible for the provider of that centralized wrapper to make it harder for you to interact with their customers without yourself using the centralized wrapper. The more they do so, the less value there is to you (the decentralized user) in the millions/billions of people using decentralized service X through centralized wrapper Y, because they&#x27;re effectively unreachable unless you also use said centralized wrapper.<p>This can happen by continuing to use the decentralized infrastructure, but penalizing participants who aren&#x27;t accessing the infrastructure through a popular system. Alternatively, it can happen by having the decentralized infrastructure co-opted, so even though the service to some extent interacts with it, most user interaction actually exists entirely within the centralized system.<p>I mean, it doesn&#x27;t seem crazy for me to imagine a world in which (eg) as a Coinbase user there&#x27;s some monetary advantage to receiving payments from Coinbase members vs the wider Bitcoin world. At which point maybe merchants want you to pay via &quot;Coinbase Send&quot; (or w/e this hypothetical service is called) rather than pure Bitcoin transactions. At which point, sure, Bitcoin is the underlying unit of value, but no-one is <i>actually</i> using Bitcoin transactions (Coinbase is just moving around their internal accounting DB records), and hence the fact that things are counted in Bitcoin is basically a historical artifact.<p>I have no idea what will happen. My argument is just that I don&#x27;t think that it is impossible for decentralized systems to be functionally neutered when people mostly interact with them through centralized wrappers.",1421871663

8925426,comment,8923721,8924360,0,0,Karunamon,,,"I think the difference between Reddit and 8chan, <i>the</i> difference, is the lack of a voting system. Consider that Reddit, after any post has three more downvotes than upvotes (score of -2), by default, that post will be hidden. Most Reddit users browse not logged in (according to their own stats), and of those that are, most have this &quot;threshold&quot; option still turned on, and it leads to more echo chambering since views that are unpopular will simply go unseen. Another plague is that people will go through your comment history and attempt to use that to discredit you.<p>On any *chan style imageboard, this isn&#x27;t a thing. You can hide posts that you don&#x27;t like, but by design, all posts are equal. If someone posts something you don&#x27;t like, your options are to ignore it or respond to it, but it&#x27;s there, in the open, for all to see.<p>This, I think, is the better system, combined with the default anonymous posting style of these boards that completely ensures that any post is judged on its merits, rather than the identity of its poster. That&#x27;s not say that board culture doesn&#x27;t exist, it does, but it exists purely socially, rather than being a feature of the software. The things I&#x27;ve seen happening on YouTube and G+ and Facebook have convinced me that existence of a coherent identity has zero impact on people&#x27;s behavior.",1421871431

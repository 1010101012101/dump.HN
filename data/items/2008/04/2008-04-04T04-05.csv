It's not a sprint, the harder thing is sustaining willpower.<p>The trick is balance.<p>Force yourself to take breaks and give yourself rewards. I finished a big piece of code on Tuesday and went for a bike ride to the Persidio. Exercise is also a great way to deal with stress.<p>Eat well, splurge a little and make sure you are eating foods high in Omega-3. Your brain will thank you.<p>Talk to your friends about your ideas. It is energizing evangelizing your ideas and getting people passionate. Doing so over a pint at the Toronado is a bonus.<p>And finally have fun!

I got to see how my Americans friends hanged out both as a teenager and as a professional. I got to see how my parents friends interact with each other.<p>As tx wrote, this isn't a technology thing, it is a cultural thing.<p>Back in 1992, the author Neal Stephenson went over to China to do research for his book, <i>Diamond Age</i>. He wrote a whole essay on that trip in Wired Magazine. One story he shared was about the cell phones. Powerful, influential men had were early adopters of those cell phones -- big, huge, klunky, mildly phallic. These men would go to restaurants with their entourage and would stand The Cell Phone in the middle of the table to show off the depth and breadth of their social network.<p>Stephenson had talked to one such guy about it, who complained that it was hard to lug this around. So Stephenson told him how people in Hong Kong and the southern portions were handling it -- by getting a flunky in their entourage to carry it.<p>If that sounds absurd, there are lots of technologies that have a decidedly American cultural slant to them. Back in George Washington's time, the lawn of the White House was kept short with grazing sheep. In those days, if you had a huge lawn that was not for grazing animals, that was a sign of wealth. Look at this huge lawn! I'm so wealthy, I can afford not to put the animals out there to pasture!<p>After WWII, with rising population, massive increases in manufacturing capabilities, and financing, owning a house in the suburbs became a foundational symbol of the American Dream.<p>And guess what? Each of those houses have a lawn. Which a whole set of technologies were invented for the caring and feeding of the lawn: lawnmowers, leaf-blowers, high-tech fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides. People didn't have sheep anymore, and it isn't as if the kids went out there to play (not with video games beckoning in the house). So why do you keep seeing people watering their lawns, fertilizing it until it becomes absurdly green, all just to trim it to the perfect height? If you kept it unkempt, your neighbors start snubbing you, because they are angry at you for lowering their property value.<p>You can take any technology and you can see uses that are always tied to some cultural context. As a culture with a lot of gadgets, we'd like to think that we're using technology in an objective, rational, <i>optimized</i> way. But we're not. People are people.",1207282904

Your source code is an implementation detail.  :-)<p>Most Web 2.0-ish startups aren't doing a lot of really tricky stuff behind the scenes (i.e. you can kind of guess what the implementation is like most of the time anyway) and most commercial competitors aren't going to be dumb enough to risk the legal implecations of stealing your code.  The chances of you losing your work because you didn't have an off-site backup are infinitely higher than you losing it because a competitor steals it and uses it against you.<p>That said, since I already had a VCS set up here, and have a little of The Paranoia too, we use a local server for version control and then do a GPG encrypted backup offsite.",1207281785

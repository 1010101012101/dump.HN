2. Use him to inspire yoursleves in the endeavours YOU want to undertake, and NOT to become Phelps.
3. Stop feeling bad about yourselves for not being Phelps. 
4. Use happiness as your yardstick and not what others think about you.
5. Don't force yourself to immitate others, instead spend time on discovering what you love and allow/push yourself to excel in it.
6. If you do, you'll enjoy watching Phelps and move on with your life.
7. Replace Phelps above with Jobs/Jordan/James Bond...<p>Peace.<p>K",1343833185

The idea that ""If you really deeply care about something, you will do it"" is such a simplification that it borders on misleading.<p>A typical example is literature. Check out Bukowski's ""air and light and time and space"" (<a href=""http://hellopoetry.com/poem/air-and-light-and-time-and-space/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hellopoetry.com/poem/air-and-light-and-time-and-space...</a>): I've always loved this poem for explaining succinctly (and artfully) the problem with general procrastination and excuse making:<p><pre><code>  ...

  you're going to create with part of your mind and your
  body blown
  away,
  you're going to create blind
  crippled
  demented,
  you're going to create with a cat crawling up your
  back while
  the whole city trembles in earthquakes, bombardment,
  flood and fire.
  baby, air and light and time and space
  have nothing to do with it
  and don't create anything
  except maybe a longer life to find
  new excuses
  for.
</code></pre>
This definitely has the ring of truth. But in reality neither novelists and ports work this way. Many writers concede that an important part of the trade is teaching yourself the discipline to write N pages a day (google ""writer discipline"", you'll be amazed, these guys work harder than coders!)<p>So let me rephrase: Choosing <i>what</i> to do, e.g. coding instead of being a marine biologist is an act of love; consistently <i>doing</i> good work requires discipline, whether you love your profession or not.",1343833122

This is demonstrably false. If anything, it's a ""<i>low-powered</i> assault rifle"".<p>The AR-15's 5.56mm NATO ammunition [1] is designed to be light and portable, and to injure rather than kill. Compare that to, say, the AK-47 and it's 7.62x39 ammunition [2]. The energy of the AR-15 ammo is about 1300J, while that of the AK's is 1500J or more.<p>The media is causing a certain degree of the fear here. I see three possible reasons:<p>A. They've got a specific agenda<p>B. They expect that sensationalism will get them better ratings<p>C. They're lazy.

I'm already able to work from home effectively on my ~8Mbps connection and can very effectively video conference. There are very, very few technical reasons why people don't work from home, and far more cultural and political ones.<p>If you imagine we are dealing with a limited amount of money (which, let's face it, we are) there is far more benefit derived from providing everyone with a 2Mbps connection than providing people in inner cities with a 1Gbps connection.",1343829832

How many separate things are there in the world that kill 5 or more people in the US each year?  An awful lot.  IIRC the number of people killed in newspaper related accidents in the UK is about that high.<p>Society only has so much attention, people only spend so much time learning about the world every day, and people only have so much capacity for worry.  To the extent that we use up our worry on things that aren't important we lose the ability to worry about the things that are.  I don't expect all the ink spilled on this shooting to save a single life, but if a similar amount of popular attention was devoted to teaching people what drowning really looked like it would probably save about 50 lives every year[1].<p>If you're going to cross the street it doesn't make sense to split your attention between looking to either side for oncoming cars and looking up for falling objects.  Falling objects are very rare, and to the extent that you waste time worrying about them you're more likely to get run over.<p>[1]<a href=""http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mariovittone.com/2010/05/154/</a>",1343829826

I have a few apps on there and I get e-mails every few days from ""advertisement networks"" that all claim that they will increase my eCPM 5x to 10x, that they will be non intrusive to my users, that they have high profile partners and innovative revenue sharing schemes. They just need me to add this little library of code to my apps.<p>Now I always refuse these offers. It's too difficult to figure out who is legitimate and who is not. However, these offers are so frequent and sometimes they even look interesting and original such that I can imagine some developers would be willing to try them out.<p>Every time I buy an app on the play store I wonder: Has the developer succumbed to the temptation and let a shady piece of code with spyware or adware in their app?",1343829679

Until it devalued.<p>In the 90s the Polish zloty was pegged against a basket of 4 or 5 currencies, I forget, which included marks, dollars, yen, and swiss francs if I recall.<p>Today, the Singapore Dollar has one of the lowest aggregate volatilities, precisely because it is tightly controlled against a basket of global currencies.<p>The motivation is exactly what you point out: reducing exposure to a single currency&#x27;s fluctuations, and trying to match a country&#x27;s balance of payments more accurately. Often, unfortunately, because baskets go together with pegs (crawling or not, with bands or not), they encourage speculative attack at some stage or another.<p>You mention your consumption basket in AUD has become more expensive. Your country is highly exposed to commodities which have dropped about 37% in the past 3 years, as measured by the CRB. Thus your nation&#x27;s income is declining, and you&#x27;re unfortunately unavoidably exposed to that if you don&#x27;t hedge your foreign consumption currency basket, because recognizing Australia&#x27;s commodity links, the market has depreciated the AUD against the dollar by 28%, and by 15% against the EUR in the same 3 year period. That, by the way, keeps commodity prices denominated in AUD, more stable, and dampens the blow to the Australian economy. But it makes foreign goods more expensive (as it is supposed to given Australia&#x27;s economic circumstances).<p>You could have hedged yourself quite well by simply going to a broker and selling an AUDUSD futures contract for example, and these contracts are available in &quot;retail&quot; size, or even smaller if you&#x27;re prepared to get into the index betting sites. Essentially the option is open to you at very reasonable cost, to create your own exposure basket, and that basket, by the way, could also include commodities themselves. Indeed I would argue that currently, as we move towards higher risks of political/policy upheaval globally, hedging is more important than ever. But not putting all your eggs in one basket has always been good advice, as you point out ;-) My point is that you can do that with your liabilities as well as your assets, quite easily.",1443864559

However, I do think that most PNG viewers use nearest-neighbor (at least that&#x27;s what my viewer did when I gave it a partial PNG file).<p>But it&#x27;s not just the interpolation that makes a difference: PNG interlaces full RGB pixels (all 3 channels at the same time), while FLIF gives priority to luma so you get a chroma subsampling effect on partial files. Also GIF only has vertical interlacing and PNG only does 7 passes of 2D interlacing, which means that for huge images, the first pass can still take a while.<p>Another point: I am proposing to use progressive decoding to avoid having to download the full lossless image (so a browser supporting FLIF would need some mechanism to stop downloading the image file when &quot;enough&quot; detail is available). Repeated re-rendering is not necessary. E.g. on a mobile phone you would rather just download some prefix of the file (the size of the prefix could depend on the available bandwidth) and render it once, at least until the user zooms in on the image, or saves or prints it or something -- then the download should be resumed in order to load more/all detail.",1443863557

However, I think there are two different kinds of &quot;abstraction&quot; at play here.  The more common is where you have a basic set of building blocks and build abstractions with them.  The second is where you adjust the building blocks.  That&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s profound...and profoundly difficult, I found.<p>For example, I believe to have discovered that we need a slightly more complex notion of identifier/reference/variable (I call them Polymorphic Identifiers [1][2][3]).  Smalltalk says that we only need messages (procedural abstraction) to be polymorphic, identifiers and things like assignment are simple/monomorphic.  SELF (another &quot;Power of Simplicity&quot; [4]) essentially said that you don&#x27;t really need separate identifiers for things at all, all the things that look like identifiers are really message-sends.  This makes a <i>lot</i> of sense at first glance, and at second and third.  However, there are subtle problems related to the Uniform Access Principle [5], and my contention is that to solve these problems you can&#x27;t layer abstractions on top, you actually have to go against the grain and make one of the fundamental building blocks (variable access, both read and write) slightly more complicated.  And that you actually need the concept  &quot;variable access&quot; :-)<p>Having worked with PIs for a bit now, it looks like this slightly more complicated primitive really <i>does</i> help solve/reduce a lot of complexities in real world systems.  As far as I can tell, a lot of these complexities are fundamentally &quot;storage&quot; related, but that unifying abstraction is lost because the mechanisms we have available are procedural.  Once you have it, you get building blocks similar to shell filters that you can combine to create variations as one-liners that would otherwise be many pages of code, similar to McIlroy&#x27;s shell solution to Jon Bentley&#x27;s word count challenge (6 lines of shell vs. Knuth&#x27;s 12 pages of Pascal/Web) [6]<p>However, communicating this appears to be nearly impossible.  For example, David Ungar (of Self fame) reviewed my paper and just tore it to shreds, misunderstanding not just the solution, but also the problem, and completely incorrectly claiming that Self already solves those problems.  He stopped responding when I showed him the (very simple) examples demonstrating the problem in Self.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2508169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2508169</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/publications/media/WeiherHirschfeld_2013_PolymorphicIdentifiersUniformResourceAccessInObjectiveSmalltalk_AcmDL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/publications/media...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://objective.st/URIs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st/URIs/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/self-power.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bibliography.selflanguage.org/_static/self-power.pdf</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2011/12/more-shell-less-egg...</a>",1443863402

Like every substance you consume, amount, frequency--and sometimes intent--matter far more than molecular composition.<p>In regard to LSD specifically, please note that the link to schizophrenia has since been proven null, and the individuals studied were already displaying signs of the disorder. Further research in more recent years, while limited, has been unable to find <i>any</i> correlation between incidents of mental illness and the use of hallucinogenics.<p>As per cannabis... without it I&#x27;d most certainly be addicted to Rx painkillers.

For me it&#x27;s a clear choice.  It allows me to function, and unlike other pain management regimens, after 7 years its minimum effective dose (MED) despite daily administration remains unchanged; if I skip a day or 6 months, my pain is not magnitudes above baseline.<p>I&#x27;m not here to tout the benefits of marijuana, but to explain how drugs are an indifferent tool, and just because they are harmful in one context doesn&#x27;t mean we should discount their usefulness in another.

These times are lonely and just meeting a new person and having a normal conversation, no matter how short, can make a huge difference, to &#x27;snap out of it&#x27;.<p>The life force is strong even with those determined to kill themselves - conscious decision making to end it all is over-ruled by some mystery hypervisor deep down in the brain. Guy snatches a few moments with one of those pretty girls that have been ignoring him for all of his life - what do you expect? Life <i>is</i> worth living, after all and &#x27;I must kill myself&#x27; gets over-ruled for another day. That isn&#x27;t about fscking or consuming, that is just about being a fragile human being and wanting someone to love.<p>Secondly, we rarely tell stories exactly as the events happened. With each telling of a story we learn what is important to the story and what is not. We omit facts that are not entirely necessary to be told. Right now there are refugees WALKING all the way from Syria to new lives in Europe. Along the way some of these refugees might have been given a bus ride to the outskirts of a city, somewhere along the way. If such a bus ride is a few miles and yet they have walked hundreds of miles, or maybe a thousand miles, are they &#x27;lying&#x27; by claiming to have walked all the way? Are their stories fake, their epic walk undermined by a short bus ride somewhere in the midst of an epic walk?<p>In this instance, the author may not have looked for the woman every day for a year. He probably had some public holidays, health problems, bad weather or whatever  along the way, so that part may not be entirely true.<p>You may have found this story depressing but I suspect you are in a minority.",1443863045

My son (8) seems to have a class where they support the strong learners and slow learners at each of their own pace. Some people who I knew talked of eager teachers who gave the all the material they could consume.<p>Personally - 30:ish years ago I finished the second grade math book in a few weeks and the teacher berated me for consuming all the material she had (&quot;What on earth are you going to work on now?&quot;) and I ended up bored and idle for the rest of the math class. Never again did I try to pace up...<p>So, it depends on the teachers - nowadays the situation seems to be much more supportive of strong learners. A couple of decades ago though this was a political thing - areas where social democrats were strong _prohibited_ people being taught at their own pace because it did not fit with social democrat ideology of complete equality.<p>So, historically, yes, this was a thing but I think it&#x27;s better nowadays.",1443862976

Then, when company A decides to sue company B for patent infringement, company B simply finds a patent of theirs that company A is infringing, and they counter-sue then call it even.<p>It's utterly ridiculous, but it's common and considered normal these days. For example, the Qualcomm / Broadcom patent lawsuits. Cisco does the same thing.",1196034542

Often scientists seem as eager to play with programming as programmers are eager to play with (or at least read and talk about) research.",1196033655

When scanning code, I just like the ability to see my control blocks clearly. Simply because you can do something like this<p><pre><code> if (a==b) { doStuff(); } else doOtherStuff();

</code></pre>
Doesn't mean you should.<p>
I would consider this a little bit of a hangup on my part, though, as it seems other programmers go the other way. An interesting topic for a book is all the weird things programmers get hung up about. Variable naming comes to mind, as does error handling strategies. And when we get hung up, usually we're not too shy about explaining why everybody else is wrong!",1196033593

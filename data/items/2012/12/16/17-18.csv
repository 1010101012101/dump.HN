Positive reinforcement and re-direction is used in place of discipline.<p>I'm not 100% sure how I feel about it but it does seem to me that different kids react to different kinds of treatment.  Hitting one kid may really be unnecessary and even harm them mentally.  Other kids seems like absolutely nothing works on them except physical spanking.  Maybe that is due to the way their parents are raising them?  I'm not sure.<p>I remember in school a few bullies who got their ass kicked by another student and that problem was instantly solved.  So it does seem like it works sometimes.  But I hate to think we're just perpetuating a violent nature .",1355680799

4928938,comment,4927168,4927168,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Machine learning is more accurately described (in my view) as an interdisciplinary region that involves computation <i>and</i> statistics both. It's when you have to use statistics to push the bounds of computational work, or CS to tease out statistical relationships that require so much data that the size of the data itself is part of the problem.<p>When I think of ""statistics"", I think of problems where there are a few well-studied parametric approaches, in large part because there aren't enough data (in most cases) to do anything extremely complicated. If your data set is small and you need to build a generally adequate model, you can often use linear regression to get something good enough, and that may the best you can do, because model simplicity is often valuable in its own right (low risk of overfitting).<p>Many of the more non-parametric machine learning algorithms (e.g. neural nets) are computationally intense and often a bitch to debug. They work best in situations where (a) you have a lot of data, but (b) you have no idea what the structure of the relationship should be.<p>Parametric models perform extremely well when the structure is known. You have inputs X1, X2, X3 and Y, and you know that a linear model will work well. You fit one, and it captures 65% of the variance. Good. That may be enough.<p>What do you use, however, if 65% isn't good enough, or if there's a special case that becomes economically important. You can look at the residuals. They may be random noise. If they're truly ""random"", then the linear model is the absolute best you can get. That may not be, however. There might be a region of the X2-X3 space where atypically high Y-values occur for a structural reason. These atypical points may be connected to an X4 that would otherwise be discarded (because it had no general correlation with Y).<p>I think that machine learning approaches start to be worth their additional complexity in these cases where (a) there are important relationships yet to be discovered-- no one knows about them!-- and (b) those are, or might be, economically critical.",1355680456

That's what I meant when I said you'd have to selectively cull the unproductive. If you reduce the population, the remaining workers have to be more productive for per capita GDP to rise, and you still haven't shown that this would happen.

I suspect that some of the people involved had this unconscious idea that, with enough work, the 'right' answer would magically appear, and they'd move on to the next problem.  Turns out that's not what happens when choosing bleeding edge tech, but I'm not sure it's a lesson everyone learns (and I suspect it's a maxim not everyone really cares about anyway).",1355679896

However, some people in certain situations might receive unsolicited job offers, without ever even creating a resume or submitting an application, right?<p>The point I was trying to make is that, I'd encourage young people to <i>follow-up</i> after sending out a resume. It will help you gain 'chops' for future calling/prospecting that may be required. Also, it's professional to follow-up with a phone call after sending an email to someone you've never met or spoken to before.<p>I get a lot of unsolicited resumes sent my way. Hardly anyone ever calls to follow-up. My thought is, I'm a busy person, and if the person really truly wants to work with me, they won't give up. I want to see persistence.<p>I bet that Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft all have very well-thought-out recruiting programs. I'd imagine that young college grad's could be hired for a lower salary than older, more seasoned software engineers. Those large companies are probably more flexible with young recruits. Everything in life is a trade-off. Why would those companies ""shower"" kids fresh out of college with job offers? I'd venture to guess that they are interested in hiring them because it's cheaper than hiring someone else with more experience. Or maybe that's how it is in the software job market. But as I see so many Americans out of work, expecting someone to 'create jobs' for them, I think it's important to highlight what it takes to get a job that you want. I'd consider your example of software engineers being ""showered with job offers"" as an exception to the rule. Most people have to actively pursue what they want in life. Plus, in 25 years you don't want to be one of those people on TV begging the government to 'create jobs' for you! So my advice is to learn how to get what you want by asking.",1355679404

Becoming an exit node was the same as performing a Man-In-The-Middle attack.</i><p>This is de-contextualised scaremongering.<p>What the poster is referring to is that when you leave the Tor network, the connection is as it would have been before. This is by design. So if you were not using TLS, then your traffic could be read, as is the case with ALL http etc. Simple. Use SSL/TLS/SSH/ etc<p>Do a trace route to google. All those intermediate parties are capable of the same thing.<p>But if you use TLS the attack is useless.<p>Tor provides one property, Anonymity, and it does this incredibly well. Anonymity and Privacy are related by distinct properties. Obviously if you send traffic to a site and sign off with your name, Tor can't help you be anonymous there. Tor cannot prevent misuse & ignorance.<p>As for this 'MITM' attack, Tor's design is such that you do not have to trust the exit nodes for it to work.<p>As for the comparison with I2P, I don't know much about it, but I support any FOSS project that aims to provide new types of anonymity. As I understand it the problem with I2p at the moment is that there is 1 exit node facing the regular net. It's not entirely clear how I2P evades what you consider 'the problem with Tor' when connecting with the regular net.<p>EDIT: Yep, did a bit of research and i2p is subject to the same sort of ""attack"" you describe <i>""Like Tor, I2P does not magically encrypt the Internet.

4928805,comment,4928299,4928712,2,0,RyanZAG,,,"A large portion of country wealth is often tied up in land and infrastructure. Wealth generally creates more wealth (through interest and similar), so the same wealth spread across a smaller number of people will push GDP per capita upwards.<p>Higher incomes are also closely associated with better education. If you keep the number of universities and schools constant while decreasing the population, you give a larger percentage of the population access to better education.<p>If a family has two children, the wealth of the family must be divided between both children and each child has less individual wealth. As you need wealth to start a business, a higher base wealth across the population means more chance of new successful businesses being started by these children.<p>If a family has no children, the estate will move into public control, effectively increasing GDP per capita for the surviving population.<p>A reason for a low birthrate in Japan is lack of financial security. This means that people who have low wealth are self-selecting out of reproduction, effectively moving their wealth into public ownership when they pass away and moving the average up as the proportion of low wealth to high wealth families is shifted.<p>So yes, practically, GDP per capita will go up in Japan as the population shrinks. The global economy is more complex than just 'producing shiny widgets', or China would be far more well off than it is. Capitalism in action.<p>EDIT: As pointed out by others correctly, increased welfare burdens from too large a proportion of retired citizens will have an effect. This can swing two ways: increased taxes, or reduced welfare payments.<p>If reduced welfare payments is chosen, it will cancel out the problem. Japan will hopefully choose this route out of self preservation.<p>If increased taxes is chosen, it will effectively tunnel income into the housing sector (old age homes, etc) and medical sector (medicine, life support, etc). The housing sector increase will be offset by a smaller housing demand from lower population. The medical sector is the big issue: if this wealth can be tunneled into Japanese medicine and health care, then it will simply be a transfer from taxpayers to Japanese in the medical sector. This would probably cause all kinds of distortions and should be avoided. However, it's not guaranteed to be a bad thing, I think anyway. You'll just have more Japanese going to medical school.",1355677826

You have to create the structure by deciding what's important to you, and you may face opposition from managers who think they know better than you do when it comes to what you should be doing.<p>If I were running a company, the default assumption would be that employees are autonomous and the manager's role would be advisory, as in, ""If you don't know what to work on yet, <X> would be a good place to start.

Any adviser that judges your capabilities based on how long you spend in the lab is a fool.<p>But I think that in cases similar to the original author's, the student incorrectly perceives the pressure on him to be to spend more time in the lab and less on other things, whereas it is actually to be more productive and focused.

4928766,comment,4925900,4927682,2,0,shmageggy,,,"This seems to be at odds with your reply to the sibling comment. If Newtonian physics is incomplete, then the statements it makes about reality are, strictly speaking, wrong. Yet to flatly reject Newtonian physics would be silly, since it clearly has some aspect of truth to it, having been useful not only in practical tasks, but as a platform for building more complete accounts of physics. \nAnalogously, modern physics may have contradictions and is clearly ""wrong"" at some level, yet it is remarkably good at explaining lots of empirical phenomenon, and we would probably be much worse off if we scrapped the whole enterprise and started over from first principles rather than building on what we have until the next breakthrough. Your litmus test may be right, but that's no way to do science. Lastly, since you aren't a fan of Kuhn, do you prefer any one else's account of philosophy of science?",1355677392

Something pluggable where more than just RAM and HDD were swappable. One thing that came up, however, was what to do about ""evolving"" wireless standards. Well, what if you could get a completely open source software defined radio? Might be bloody expensive for the miniaturization, and it would have certain physical limits (due to antenna sizes mostly), but it might go a long way to solving the whole problem of having to ""upgrade"" your phone or laptop just to get higher connection speeds, or have NFC/Bluetooth 3/etc.<p>(the above are ramblings of a code monkey who dabbles in simulating RF; negative mutterings about how unrealistic or stupid the above ideas are will be politely ignored).",1355677372

Unless the government has put enough aside to pay for the retirement of all these people (very doubtful), then it must get whatever it can from the citizens who are working -- and with a very small amount of people working, that means that each worker will have to pay a lot more in taxes, which is not likely to lead to either economic prosperity or reelection of the politicians (even though their hands will be completely tied down).",1355677310

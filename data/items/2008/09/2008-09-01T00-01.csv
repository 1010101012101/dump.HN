291604,comment,291132,291531,0,0,sofal,,,"I've used Ruby for quite a while. I don't use Rails, and I haven't touched a web application in a long time. I've used it for system scripts, GUI applications (JRuby), game development, data processing, automation of MS Office applications, testing, prototyping, distributed build and deploy scripts, middleware, etc. I use Ruby for anything and everything I can think of programming unless I need to get closer to the hardware or integrate with something written in a different language.<p>Ruby can be used and will be used anywhere that Python can. They're both great languages, but I prefer Ruby for a few small reasons that Yegge seems to cover.<p>It's understandable that you might have this confusion, though, since if you're not a Ruby user it's easy to get the impression that Rails is the programming language. I constantly have to educate people about that (""Repeat after me: Rails is not a programming language""). Sometimes I wish Rails wasn't so popular, because I believe Ruby can stand on its own. I'm tired of conversations like this:<p>""Have you heard of Ruby?""<p>""No.""<p>""Okay, have you heard of Rails?""<p>""Oh, Rails! That's what you're talking about!""<p>""No, that is not what I'm talking about.""<p>I get this from the standard folks who never venture outside of their C++/Java/C# pens, and they've heard of Python only because of Google (tip for language evangelists: a hot and trendy company does more for your language than a killer app).<p>I would expect, however, that people who use Python would realize that Ruby stands right beside it as a similarly beautiful and productive dynamic language. In this I am constantly disappointed. Maybe it's a sign that Ruby is losing the popularity contest and will fade away to the sidelines. There are too many clueless people who pick up Python and love it and swear by the gods that there is no language like it, even though their experience with languages is summed up with C++, Java, and now Python. It's the language that ropes in all the clueless people that eventually wins. Congrats to my Python brothas.",1220229548

Yeah, each iteration has a little more information added to it. ""Saving <i>what</i> document?"" ""Saving is important <i>why</i>?"" ""What is the <i>alternative</i> to saving?"" Thanks for the slowly unfolding tutorial there...<p>Okay. Listen, the MSFT dialog works like this. It's a boolean. It's very short and simple: The answer is ""yes"" or ""no"". The user gets used to this yes/no format.<p>Save? yes/no<p>Print? yes/no [<-- doesn't really exist]<p>Restore settings? yes/no<p>The consistency of this reduces one's need to actually read-and-process-and-understand what are extremely simple questions inherently.",1220229458

These are minor issues at startups that have bigger issues to take care of - but they are major issues for any other small business.<p>An educated workforce would appear without the government. Private roads and dark fiber are tenable infrastructure alternatives.<p>Enforcement of contracts is one of the two things I'd like government to take care of. That and punishment of violent crimes.<p>I agree that arguing about the ideal form of government is a bit of a waste. The solutions have been clear to me for years.",1220229389

291595,comment,291567,291567,0,0,iamdave,,,"I don't think so.  Twitter has evolved into a communication tool that doubles as an alert system for some uses.  Live feed is less voluntary, since it's automatically recording and publishing what you're doing.  The appeal isn't JUST being having updates on what's going on, it's letting people interact with your actions, to collaborate from multiple mediums.  LiveFeed seems limited to what you do on Facebook, Twitter lets users define their own activity, and FriendFeed scrapes everything.<p>Where's the appeal, then?   I think saying this will ""kill"" anything is incredibly premature.",1220227996

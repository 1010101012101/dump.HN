How the industry is structured now sucks and is completely backwards. Have they not seen the tremendous growth of the Internet (an open ecosystem for development) over the last decade? Have they not seen the massive goodwill, economic benefit and creative outflows that have been happening.<p>Someone needs to drag these guys kicking and screaming over to the money tree and shut them up.",1213462107

217574,comment,217380,217497,0,0,cubix,,,"Thanks for the link. I've struggled since childhood with both falling asleep and waking up, especially the latter. (Some of my earliest memories involve been ripped out of bed and thrown into a cold car to be taken to school.) I've read quite a few articles like this over the years, but this is the first time I've encountered the notion of practicing a routine during waking hours to program yourself to get up. Interesting idea -- I may even give it a shot.",1213461874

But once I got into the real world (aka corp gig) I realized that I was most productive in the early hours of the morning, my job required me to get up early.  Now I have totally embraced the morning as my ""getting stuff done"" time.  I have more energy and time, I won't be going back to the night owl lifestyle anytime soon.",1213461485
217570,comment,217411,217562,0,0,babul,,,"Well put. A problem many who are starting out face is contingency if things go wrong i.e. startup fails.<p>It is easy to say do another one, but without funding/investors this can be hard and people must eat and bills must be paid.<p>Hence with .NET being the choice of most businesses (as most they are already tooled with MS products etc), going .NET initially also allows the fallback position of easier consulting/contract work at times when money is needed.<p>However, ultimately the choice should be on what allows you to meet and iterate upon your objectives in the fastest way possible, as the best way to stay live is to be able to adapt and change and exploit markets rapidly. Hence with this in mind, I would opt for Ruby as imho it provides a better grounding into architectures and pratices that will best serve you in both the short and longer terms.<p>Hope this is of help :)",1213461310

217566,comment,217311,217462,0,0,jon_dahl,,,"Agreed - IMO, until 2 or more players have saturated the market, competition isn't going to necessarily keep you out.<p>Two other bits of advice:<p>1. Find something limited in scope, and build it under constraints. At least to start, assuming that you're going to keep your day job. In other words: can you build something that actually has value, and that you would use, in 40 hours? This is a good exercise for a first startup project, and can keep you from running down a rabbit hole.<p>2. Decide if this is a side project or a full-time job. If it is a side project, you can build something you like and help it grow slowly, without worrying about your take-home pay right away. If you're going to quit your day job, the stakes are much higher - you can't rely on slow growth (because your rent/mortgage depends on profit), and you should never rely on explosive viral growth (because it probably won't happen to you, no matter how good you are).",1213460164

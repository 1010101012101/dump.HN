However, that hasn't happened.<p>Alternatively, if a person suffered monetary damages (current and future), they can sue the abuser for damages. This is what protects big companies from potential DMCA abusers because they have a lot to lose.<p>Since free content creators can't sue for damages but only counternotice and accept liability if they're not scared from the notice; but people sharing the content will be more afraid of the legalese in counternotices. The bill's intent was to stop freely infringing copyright content, it also consequently kills free content sharing due to the unchecked abuse.

If you are considering an MBA, then go for that instead.<p>Someone saying they want to learn how to code to form a startup is like someone saying they want to open a restaurant by memorizing recipes.  Memorizing recipes is only 1% of what it takes to be a viable chef.<p>Besides knowing the ingredients:<p>You have to know how to mix the ingredients properly.<p>You have to know how to select the better quality ingredients.<p>You have to know how to actually cook the food properly without burning it, etc.<p>As the recipes get more complex, you have to know how to time each aspect of the recipe so that different aspects of the dishes don't cook before others, and they're left cooling.<p>As you cook for more and more people, you have to know how scale your techniques for larger batches of food.<p>You have to know how to scale your suppliers, etc.<p>The exact same thing applies to programming.  Learning how to ""code"" is almost meaningless.  To be useful, and to actually build things that won't fail, you need to get experience so much more experience.  If the person in question is actually <i>interested</i> in coding, and loves technology and loves the thrill of building stuff, then go ahead.  If the point is to create a startup and be more ""useful"", then don't bother, because it's too hard, especially if you're starting from ground zero.  It takes YEARS of coding experience, working 40 hrs a week, to be able to build something viable.<p>If you want to create a startup in the very near future, then hire the people you need, and concentrate on the vision, there's no shame in that.

3458473,comment,3458263,3458263,2,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"I couldn't agree more with this. I spent the best part of a day setting up Capistrano and Railsless-Deploy to obviate the need for manual FTP upload. That was only at the start of this week but the flexibility and elegance of it (comparative to opening up an FTP client) has enchanted me. A few shell scripts later on the target server and it's sorted (with a few niggles still to be ironed out).<p>I've been really disillusioned with FTP since just one flaw in the setup (as much as setting the wrong group on files or someone chmodding them all over the place) can muck your upload up. So you have to ssh in, change it all back, and retry.<p>If you use a VCS you're probably uploading direct from your checkout, or you're exporting it, if you're not savvy with the system. So you get dotfiles scattered throughout, or an inaccurate export if there was a forgotten commit or update.<p>Maybe your project has dependencies fetched in through some sort of manager. You change them, fire up the FTP and upload, and forget to log into the server to run an update or install to fetch in the altered dependencies. If you're a PHP dev (who more likely than not doesn't know what PEAR is) coming into a Python, Ruby, or Node environment, for example, this one will sting you every time until you understand that you generally won't commit dependencies to a repo - you'll fetch them in and rebuild when necessary.<p>How about restarting the server if you need to? Cleanup? Rolling back <i>quickly</i>?<p>Even taking it all into consideration you have at the very least a two step process: upload your files, ssh into the server to run additional setup. If you end up doing this a lot in a short space of time due to carelessness and unexpected bug-fixing<i></i>, you'll get frustrated very quickly.<p>Having suffered these problems ever since I started my job, it feels liberating to keep my copy of FileZilla closed in favour of typing a single command into my console:<p><pre><code>    cap [staging|live] deploy\n</code></pre>\nAnd if it isn't adequate, it's no problem. I can code another task and alter its behaviour for the different environments.<p>It's liberating.<p><i></i> I had a terrible hour the other day wondering why identical code behaved differently on two identical setups. There was much FTP uploading and server restarting. Turned out that file permissions weren't being set the same. It would have been a quick fix without all the manual work.",1326411796

First off, it seems like a false dichotomy: the ideal situation is to have the hard skills afforded by a computer science education (something that irked me as the article seemed to equivocate 'learning to code' with 'knowing computer science') while having the soft skills and networking afforded by an MBA.  (This is to speak nothing of the assumption that great developers suddenly have those 'lightbulb moments' -- I know amazing programmers who have no desire to think outside the box.)<p>The second issue I had with the article demonstrated the kind of mindset that comes from undervaluing 'soft skills' and the MBA education (as engineers tend to do) -- ""If you build an excellent product with product/market fit then people will buy it."" Obviously there are exceptions, but in the general realm of business, this is laughably naive -- there's a reason that marketing expenses (especially for startups who compete more for mindshare than monthly fees) are so high.  Amazing products fail all the time.<p>I certainly don't mean to undervalue the ability to code: I'm a CS/Business double major, and without a doubt the CS degree is opening way more doors than the BBA.  But, just as you're not going to hire an MBA to 'build stuff for the web', you're not going to -- or shouldn't -- hire a software developer to spearhead business development or marketing.",1326409810

So, if you are playing Angry Birds, tap an email notification and then press back, you return to Angry Birds. But, also, in screens in which the user may want to go to the parent element, developers should put a button to go ""home"".

I guess Apple has a valid way to subscribe without e-mail verification somewhere.<p>Let me tell you a story, sorry if it is somewhat OTish, but I really feel related to the programmingzen guy. Back when I got my Gmail address  I got a 6 char username account of the form name+surname initial. My name is Pedro, its not that common but neither is it a bizarre name. At the moment, I can count 5 different people who sometimes think they own my e-mail address, or have e-mail addresses that are similar enough to mine so that people usually mails me instead of them.<p>About a month ago, one Pedro subscribed to Redbox. It seems Redbox has kiosks where you can instantly subscribe and order your first DVDs there, those kiosks do no mail validation. Someone used my e-mail on the kiosk, and ordered his first DVD. I got the receipt in my inbox.<p>At first I thought he would realize he did something wrong and fix his Redbox account from his computer later. He didn't. In fact, he somehow managed to order more DVDs, so I got more receipts in my inbox. I used the password recovery feature and logged to his (or mine?) Redbox account. There was no way to delete it, neither was it possible to avoid getting receipts by e-mail.<p>I contacted Redbox support asking them to close the account, or at least stop sending me receipts. This was their proposed solution to my problem:<p><i>As long as he or she keeps using your email address, youll continue to get receipts. To avoid receiving them, please block the senders email address or mark the messages as spam. If those options dont work, you might need to contact your email provider.</i><p>So yeah, Apple is not the only one who doesn't care about people who by chance get subscribed to their services.<p>Fortunately, after about three weeks, Redbox started mailing me and asking me for e-mail validation with big red banners and all caps subjects. I didn't reply to any of those e-mails, and it seems they finally deleted the account.<p>Free anecdote: Once, one of the other Pedros mom died. That week my inbox was completely surreal, and sad.<p>PD: I live in Argentina. So no, free DVDs where not an option for me.",1326409378

Yes, it is taking over the rest of the internet (web-mail and such).  Yes, client-side HTTP is often the only part of the internet you can have from many networks.  But no, that is not a good thing.<p>But because of sloppy wording, non-technical people get the idea that if they can query web servers, then ""they have the internet"".  Most restrictions go unnoticed.<p>I know it may sound pedantic.  It may even remind you of Stallman's <i>GNU</i>/Linux.

But in most SQL engines that internal data structure is a complex web of interlinked structures and objects. In SQLite, the compiled form of statements is a short program in a machine-language like representation. Users of the database can view this virtual machine language by prepending the EXPLAIN keyword to a query.</i><p><i>The use of a virtual machine in SQLite has been a great benefit to the library's development. The virtual machine provides a crisp, well-defined junction between the front-end of SQLite (the part that parses SQL statements and generates virtual machine code) and the back-end (the part that executes the virtual machine code and computes a result.) The virtual machine allows the developers to see clearly and in an easily readable form what SQLite is trying to do with each statement it compiles, which is a tremendous help in debugging. Depending on how it is compiled, SQLite also has the capability of tracing the execution of the virtual machine - printing each virtual machine instruction and its result as it executes.</i>",1326409270

They&#x27;re usually young men, although this article mentions a family (but gives no details). It certainly requires shearing off all commitments that might require you to have stuff.<p>While being very far from &quot;minimalist&quot;, I&#x27;ve moved house and helped a few people move over the past year, and every time there is a large chunk of stuff which has to be thrown away. Sometimes it&#x27;s old tat, sometimes it&#x27;s genuinely useful and once valuable but consumes too much space (sofas are a particular problem, but furniture and kitchen goods are often victims of this). I don&#x27;t like throwing things away which have pleasant associations or are still useful, and this leads me to avoid acquiring them in the first place.<p>(That reminds me, must finish buying a shed for my outdoor junk...)<p>There&#x27;s an entire infrastructure of capitalism set up for us to buy things. There isn&#x27;t really a comparable one for taking them away and getting money back. Partly because owning a thing de-standardises it; it acquires a history and potentially hidden problems.",1428314196

So reducing household/business energy cost meant more money in the bank for investment / disposable income spent in the local economy.<p>Now all of a sudden the rhetoric is the slowdown the last quarter was due to the <i>falling</i> price of oil leading to a decrease in manufacturing orders for pipelines and rigs. The shift being that US produces most of its own oil (or used to before the latest <i>Price Wars</i>). If consumer confidence is low, the energy savings are paying down debt or going to savings, so now oil price falling is a net loss to the economy? Very hard to believe this, but that&#x27;s the &quot;word on the street&quot;.<p>Not like the price of gas actually stayed low for long, refineries tightened up and the price recovered significantly, even while oil remains down 50%.

Contrarily to others in this thread, I get what the author is trying to do with the MyDef library and I share that goal myself.<p>As I see it, such lightweight scripting (meta-)layer is not intended to replace a programming language in full.

A templating meta-layer is not a good fit for those, that&#x27;s why you should use them in combination - use something like MyData to write the &quot;general picture&quot; flow, dive in into the hard language to build the details.

9327242,comment,9325952,9325952,0,0,herghost,,,"This feels like more of a solution looking for a problem, to me.  Why?  Because even if I increase the entropy of my passwords/passphrases for systems I have to use every single day, the vast majority of them are still going to need me to use numbers and special characters, AND make me change the password in the region of every 30-40 days.<p>Going to all this trouble to generate an admittedly excellently secure password continues to pass the burden of good passwords on to the end user whilst doing nothing to alleviate the core problem, namely that I have to regularly use about 10-20 passwords each day.<p>My preferred solution is www.passwordchart.com<p>In this, I select one very good password/passphrase (for which I could use this method) and then I use an indicator of where I&#x27;m logging into to generate site/program specific passwords, e.g.,<p>Phrase: cleft cam synod lacy yr wok<p>Password: 123facebook321<p>Generates: yb63476F9xk6RjGVyp6yp6Hj8347b6y (with +Include Numbers ticked)<p>Phrase: cleft cam synod lacy yr wok<p>Password: 123twitter321<p>Generates: yb6347963m6mj963963RjfRd347b6y (with +Include Numbers ticked)<p>So, for my remembering <i>one</i> complex passphrase and <i>one</i> strategy for generating passwords I can generate strong, complex passwords for any site I need and don&#x27;t have to remember a single one of them.  The only pre-requisite I have to get into a site on another machine from my own is that I have internet access (or have a printed copy of the matrix, or something like that).<p>(My dependence on this website is the one weak link in this, and I have actually implemented something similar on my own webspace that I just need to tweak usability for a bit before I switch over.)",1428312136

That doesn&#x27;t seem to jive with reality. What am I missing here?

Surely the overheads for looking at every single thing are so costly it borders on inefficient? I understand the &#x27;deputising&#x27; of Facebook, Google ect. But why do governments want all this data? Is it as Snowden puts, &#x27;[to have] a gun over our head.&#x27;?

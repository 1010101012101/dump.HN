The projects he has implemented were too expensive in terms of development and maintenance to have enough time apart. And none of the projects was general enough to produce a code-base that could serve as a product for several customers. \nAnother friend implemented a little access-based niche-domain tool during an internship for a big enterprise that he was able to resell to several competitors and even several times within the same enterprise. He is working around 5 hours per week and makes a confort living.\nHonestly, I think the first story gives the more likely scenario.",1208188553

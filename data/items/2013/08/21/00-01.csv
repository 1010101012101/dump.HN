6247560,comment,6246777,6247495,1,0,TheZenPsycho,,,"The &quot;personal taste&quot; argument comes up a lot in usability conversations. I find it to be incredibly weak. I might personally prefer to walk blindfolded across busy roadways. But that doesn&#x27;t make it broadly easy or advisable.<p>It&#x27;s just simply a bad decision. There shouldn&#x27;t be a preference, it should just be on by default, end of story. It only makes sense on iPads.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s auto-hide by default means that most mac owners will just simply have their machines set to auto-hide the scrollbar, and very likely have no idea that a setting exists- Then blame it all on the content owners for making a bad/hard to use site. (especially if they decide they want a scrollable pane with OS specific scrollbars on it)<p>To expand a little bit, even something as seemingly arbitrary, like driving on the right or left side of the road, is <i>not</i> a matter of preference. If you pick the wrong one in a certain country, you can equally get yourself killed as with your other more obviously wrong &quot;preferences&quot;. There is value in having everything work in a standard way.",1377046699

6247538,comment,6247303,6247303,1,0,reneherse,,,"Most of these designs are pretty nice, however there are a couple of things that should not be emulated. Just some quick, well-meant observations:<p>IMO, the two designs that stand out as the best are Le Tote and Apptimize, both for their crisp, clear layouts and well-harmonized, non-cliched colors. In both cases, the background imagery helps to communicate the story of the product: The background on Apptimize connotes measurement, which is the general purpose of the app. (One little nit with the Apptimize page is the over-use of the slab-serif font in all caps as you get towards the bottom of the page, especially the &quot;News&quot; section.)<p>On Le Tote, the background connotes a sense of sophistication and glamour. The page copy, testimonials, and background all work together so that you understand that this is a fashion startup oriented toward a certain type of woman: chic, sophisticated, and aspirational. She&#x27;ll know this site is for her when she gets there.<p>Now onto things that would be better if different:<p>On Estimode, the background slider is so fast moving and distracting that it makes it near impossible to read the above the fold page copy. It&#x27;s gratuitous design: the background change, though a clever idea, provides very little new information, and only detracts from trying to understand the information that is already there. And there is no way to pause the thing; I had to keep clicking on one of the selector bubbles to keep the slider still long enough to grok the copy.<p>Similarly, the background video of Hum seems gratuitous, for what meaning do we get from just seeing a bunch of cheery folks using their smart phones? There&#x27;s not really a story being told there. The rest of the Hum page is quite monotonous with its single column layout and repetitive typography. The text is really getting into TL;DR territory.<p>On StatusPage.io, the page is informative, but the continuously moving right to left moving text is difficult to read. The GG Bridge background image is, unfortunately, a missed opportunity to convey meaning. Contrast that with the main image on BloomThat which captures the sense of the founding locale but is also informative of the story of the product.<p>Hope this isn&#x27;t too negative; I write it here in the sense of identifying things that could be improved. Best of luck to all these companies in their post demo day fundraising!",1377046239

On infinite scroll I&#x27;d bet horizontal progress has minuscule negative impact on usability vs vertical progress.  On paged I bet it performs just as well.<p>And regarding pages vs infinite scroll, I bet pages actually perform much better.   Infinite scroll is elegant for us, the developers, but for users it presents a dramatic increase in cognitive load to constantly be orienting yourself in this infinite space with hints of often unrelated content above and below.  With lots of content, infinite scroll actually encourages people to <i>scroll</i> which is usually the last thing you actually should do.  If the primary means of navigation is via a navigation menu (aka the content needs to be organized, not an article), then why the hell would you dump all the output into one giant bucket of content?",1377045190

There&#x27;s also no point in it. Safari already scrolls web pages, why re-implement it in javascript?

You could then click to tell the OS that you wanted to wanted to reflow the page using that x height as a reference point. If you pointed your mouse at the horizontal scroll bar, a vertical line appeared, and you could scroll left to right. This is sort of like pressing Control-l on Emacs. Instead scrolling and getting the desired result by trial and error, you could tell the OS exactly what you wanted to do. It was very useful for scrolling within pictures.<p>You can see a video of this here [1] at 46:50.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.loper-os.org/?p=932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loper-os.org/?p=932</a>",1377043829

There were a couple of textinputs and a &quot;make gif&quot; button. The way the code happens to work, when you press the &quot;make gif&quot; button the web page would just sit there till you where re-directed to your finished gif.<p>The first bit of advice I got from anyone was &quot;this is sooo slow, what&#x27;s happening?&quot; The problem was, I didn&#x27;t actually have any way to understand how long/what was going on in the backend. So I decided to take the next best approach:<p>I fake it.<p>As soon as you click the &quot;make a gif&quot; button, the bar starts loading. However, that bar has no basis in reality. It takes exactly 40 seconds to fill up, no matter what&#x27;s going on.<p>However, everyone loves it! All the comments I got said how much better it seemed to make the experience. Even though it&#x27;s a fake loading bar.",1377043715

6247408,comment,6246128,6247351,7,0,cgcardona,,,"[edit spelling]\nI think that the reason you find so much negativity regarding javascript is that many people come to javascript from some other language which offers features which javascript doesn&#x27;t yet offer.<p>Having cut their teeth on a language tends to leave the programmer with a worldview where any language which doesn&#x27;t have the same features which are present in their beloved language is an inferior language.<p>I believe Paul Graham refers to this as &#x27;The Blub Paradox&#x27;[0].<p>Most of the complaints surrounding javascript stem from the fact that it was initially designed to be a lightweight scripting language.<p>At the time that javascript was created I think that very few people envisioned the web growing into what it has become. Javascript wasn&#x27;t created with 100,000 line programs in mind.<p>Therefore it is currently missing some abstractions which people creating and maintaining programs in the large have come to rely on such as classes, interfaces and modules.<p>Also javascript has a very simple standard library which leads to people feeling that they need to reinvent the wheel in most cases.<p>Finally Javascript has prototypal inheritance as opposed to the more traditional class based inheritance which so many programmers are used to.<p>Of course many of the things mentioned above have already been solved or are currently being solved.<p>The ECMAScript standards body is in the process of adding classes and modules. Libraries such as underscore.js are fleshing out the standard library. And tools such as Coffeescript are providing a more class based inheritance model (if that is your thing).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>",1377043468

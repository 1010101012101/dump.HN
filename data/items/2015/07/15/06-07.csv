The problems come later when sending every URL to another party (safe browsing). Also from google &quot;Privacy: API users exchange data with the server using hashed URLs, so the server never knows the actual URLs queried by the clients.&quot; So it&#x27;s possibly safe ?",1436943524
9890083,comment,9889399,9889518,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> Harmless in itself.<p>If I had to summarize the bad security design that is epidemic in the software industry, this would be a good candidate. Security is about always being vigilant and minimizing potential risks, and not the roughly boolean categorization that most people use, where everything judged &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;unsafe&quot;.<p>TL;DR - <i>Stop using &quot;default allow&quot;!</i><p>You would think that programmers (and engineers in general) would understand that understand how small, simple pieces can become incredibly useful when you find a clever way to combine them. Unfortunately, the lesson of &quot;information hiding&quot; - and all of the stuff we derive from it, like {object,aspect}-oriented programming and other encapsulation techniques - end up being ignored when discussing security.<p>Applied to web browsers, the burden of proof should be to justify why a request is <i>both</i> necessary <i>and</i> safe. The &quot;necessary&quot; criteria is important, because we do not know how this data could be combined in the future, possibly in damaging ways. A good example of this is how the NSA uses Google&#x27;s PREF cookies[1] to track sessions. Another example is panopticlick-style browser fingerprinting, where every bit leaked can make the fingerprint more accurate.<p>The fact that this is about favicons is a perfect demonstration of how this &quot;default allow&quot; attitude. Not only is that not necessary, it can be supplied with the browser[2], completely removing the need for any GET request. Minimizing external requests isn&#x27;t even considered.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/12/1...</a><p>[2] copyright and trademark are poor excuses - if the search engine wants to be in the default set of search tools provided by the browser, they can trivially authorize the redistribution of a a simple icon.",1436943520

And it didn&#x27;t work: competitors eventually came out with devices that were desirable on their own, not just as Outlook terminals.<p>The success of iOS and Android forced Microsoft to reset their mobile platform into a product-oriented design that became Windows Phone 7. For the first time, Microsoft was offering a mobile OS that stood on its own rather than as a piece in Microsoft&#x27;s chess game of technology stacks.<p>That didn&#x27;t work either, but at least the product was good. Now Microsoft is throwing away the holistic approach of Windows Phone and reverting their mobile efforts back into the earlier strategy-driven &quot;chess piece&quot; mode.

In AMCC&#x27;s case I was concerned about the Special Magic that Apple used to convert 64-bit system calls to 32-bit.<p>The opinion of the engineer who originally wrote the driver I maintained was that a 32-bit tool was sufficient to test a 32-bit driver.<p>My opinion is that a 64-bit tool was required to test Apple&#x27;s Special Magic.  I have found and reported numerous bugs in Apple&#x27;s kernels, all but two were promptly fixed.<p>I struggled to convince Apple to fix the other two, but was refused.  One was fixed a year later after someone else reported it, the other is a spectacular zero-day that I could exploit in a heartbeat but I won&#x27;t tell you what it is not so much because Apple refuses to fix it but because the fix would break a lot of existing code.<p>In 1990 I was testing MacTCP 1.0.1 or maybe 1.1.  My manager Bruce Southwick suggested I beta test A/UX 2.0, in large part so I could help with A/UX&#x27; MacTCP emulation which was a wrapper around Berkeley sockets.<p>Among the first things I did was to verify A/UX&#x27; compliance with each of the CERT recommendations.

You say:<p>> which means that they could make arbitrary changes to the blockchain<p>This makes it sound like the 51% attacker could make arbitrary changes to the ledger, thereby stealing arbitrary shares. That is not the case. For example, such an attacker cannot forge any signatures and thus cannot manipulate transactions. All the attacker can do is censor new transactions or slowly unroll past transactions. In case of 51% of the computing power, unrolling could happen at a speed of (51% - 49%) = 2% of time, i.e. if the attack lasts for 50 days, the attacker could unroll one day worth of transactions. What makes the unrolling problematic, is that it enables the attacker to double-spend. One potential measure for NASDAQ to prevent this is to demand known signatures to be used for transactions (i.e. whenever you transfer shares, you must use a signature you previously registered with NASDAQ). With colored coins, the issuer can enforce such restrictions by refusing to redeem shares that were not properly obtained. So even in case of such an attack, NASDAQ could identify the attacker (or the person collaborating with the attacker in order to attempt a double-spend) and initiate legal measures (i.e. sue the attacker for damages).",1436941923

In that first shot, his forearm is pointing up, so his hand isn&#x27;t near arms length, but the screen hand ratio looks about right for if it were at arms length.  So depending on what his upper arm is doing, the FOV is about doubled (approx 60 degrees wide hoorizontal instead of ~30 degrees), giving it about 4 times too much area in the shot.<p>To me it just reminds me of Kinect and Molyneux&#x27;s Milo demo.  The Minecraft demo on the table they gave for example was very misleading, because when the camera guy got close to the table, he could still get the whole thing in the shot.

1970240,comment,1969979,1970173,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Salary should <i>not</i> be a way for companies to exploit their employees, though it often is because employees are spineless. The theory behind salary is that the value you provide the company is not directly correlated to the amount of time you spend at your desk, and therefore you negotiate a compensation package commensurate with a ""fair cut"" for the value you generate.<p>Again, salary is <i>not</i> given so that the company has free-reign ownership over your body and mind and it should not be a mechanism whereby the company gets an hourly employee on the cheap (some bosses seem to think that salary translates to infinite and unlimited uncompensated overtime -- of course, the 40-hour-week limit isn't necessarily applicable, but things have to stay within reasonability). What you do on your own time without company resources is your property, plain and simple. Companies are <i>not</i> buying your whole imagination and salary does not EVER mean that they own everything you thought up while on payroll. If Google feels threatened by this web server, they can probably obtain an injunction based upon non-compete agreements that stops the publication or use of the thing for a year or whatever, but they have no right to totally misappropriate it and steal it from the original author, and saying ""well, he's on salary, so we own the entire output of his energy and imagination"" is such a horrible and disgusting cop-out.<p>I've worked for some people who've thought that salary meant person-ownership and got out as quickly as possible. I was astonished to see most co-workers minimize it with things like ""Well, you know, the economy is tough, we're lucky to even have work, they'll reward us with bonuses and more down the road"".

1970226,comment,1969979,1970132,0,0,haberman,,,"I have worked at Amazon.com and I currently work at Google.  The Google policies are much, much better than Amazon's, both in letter and in practice.<p>The Google policy is not, as this article/discussion implies, a blanket policy where everything you do on your own time belongs to Google.  From my employment agreement:<p>""I understand that the provisions of this Agreement requiring assignment of Inventions to the Company do not apply to any invention which qualifies fully under the provisions of California Labor Code Section 2870 (attached hereto as Exhibit B). I will advise the Company promptly in writing of any inventions that I believe meet the criteria in California Labor Code Section 2870 and not otherwise disclosed on Exhibit A.""<p>You can see the contents of California Labor Code Section 2870 here.  It says the essence of what your Amazon agreement says; stuff you develop entirely on your own time and does not compete with the company belongs to you.\n<a href=""http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&group=02001-03000&file=2870-2872"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=lab&#3...</a><p>So far, the two companies sound the same.  But the internal policies surrounding this are worlds apart.<p>At Google, there is a fairly liberal policy around open-sourcing of code that belongs to Google.  So code that you work on internally or on 20% time can be open-sourced without much push-back.  In my experience, the policy is so favorable to open-sourcing that the primary barriers are technical (disentangling internal code from internal-only dependencies) rather than legal/policy.  From this policy we see tons of Google open-source releases, like Protocol Buffers and tcmalloc.<p>Amazon also has an open-source releasing process.  But the culture is so suspicious of open-sourcing that a friend of mine spent literally FIVE YEARS getting a project of his approved for open source release.  I am not exaggerating.  This is a project he is passionate about and has been working on for that entire time.  The project is not proprietary in any way; it's a set of UNIX utilities for piping data around in JSON format instead of flat text, and he (and a community inside Amazon) wrote a bunch of useful transformations that made it like UNIX on steroids.  Clearly not software that competes with Amazon.<p>Then there is the question of working on non-open-source software on your own time, because (for example) you're trying to do some business on the side.  Now if you can show that your side project does not compete with Google according to the California statute above, then you're legally protected and it belongs to you.  But ideally you want to avoid going to court at all.  What you want is an assurance from Google that it won't attempt to claim ownership of your work.  So there is a process called the IARC (Invention Assignment Review Committee) where you can submit a description of your work, and if your submission is accepted, you get an assurance from Google that it won't try to claim ownership of it.<p>This is a strict improvement over the Amazon situation, because you have the same legal protections you had already, but additionally you can preemptively clear the rights to any work you're doing on the side.<p>So in my view, Google has some of the best policies related to open sourcing of any company I've ever worked at, and certainly better than Amazon's.",1291498946

The overall tone of the article (admittedly, it is an obit for a noted physicist in the fire science field so it's bound to be flattering) indicates that the decade starting in 1970 began a sea change in fire safety and great gains in fire science.<p>That's my point. Big technological advances increase survivability and decrease risk. I don't get the round-eyed, slack-jawed wonder at the fact that there has been a huge drop in fire-related deaths in 89 years. Moving from open flames to electricity then improving building codes etc., provided two huge catalysts to change.

This is reinforced in industry employment agreements, including Google's (my employer)<p>Most employers take the position that everything you do in the space is logically competitive. Recognizing that, we, Google, make it very easy to get permission to open source things, but under Google copyright.<p>We have a process for releasing under your own copyright, but it is not as flexible. That said, we've cleared about 200  (75% of those requested) projects in the last year for copyright release.<p>It's easy to get knee-jerk about this and get upset, but recognizing the nature of IP in a company and acting on it is infinitely better than pretending the problem doesn't exist and then, in the future, retroactively claiming copyright when convenient. The latter leads to lawsuits and unfair restraints on creativity and competition.<p>This system works. We've released 10s of millions of lines of code into thousands of open source projects. It protects the employees and it protects Google and the price is a bit of complexity and the odd thread like this.<p>Also, thanks to this system, Googlers can work on Google equipment and during their 20% on these kinds of projects, which is clearly useful and recognizes that people who work on open source almost universally do so without regard to the machinery or network they use.",1291497927

It gives you enough leeway to innovate on your own time with your own stuff but it also gives the company the legal right to assert themselves if they feel you've strayed to close to ""company matters"".<p>(c) is important because your employer can not control what's in your head. If you work for a company that builds cars, they don't want you thinking of a new, innovative way to build a car on your own time, leaving, patenting it, and then competing with them.<p>This is entirely reasonable for both parties, IMO. In this particular case it looks like the author has build a web server. This clearly falls within the realm of what Google might consider their current or future business and therefore can reasonably believe that the author is using Google knowledge (even if not equipment, resourecs, or time) to build it.<p>EDIT: Clearly every IP agreement is different; however, every one I've ever read or signed has essentially been the above. Further, there is always a schedule allowing you to outline the IP you currently own that might violate (c).",1291496655

Ferrari/Lambo/Aston/etc. are quite unreliable long-term (i.e. over 30K miles), but Porsche is like the everyday exotic - they're actually great long-term and available in 4WD (the Carrera4, Targa4, Turbo at least). Then again the truly rare American exotics (Saleen S7, Mosler, etc.) are even worse, but next to no one even has seen them.<p>Certainly not a blanket statement about about those cars. I love Fiats/Alfas, and I'm glad they might be coming to the States soon. Though British cars have had a bad rap for a long time (from the Brit Leyland / Rover / etc. days) - Jag is still pretty boring and only Land Rover is at all relevant / reliable.",1291496632

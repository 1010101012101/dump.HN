659871,comment,658629,658918,0,0,seertaak,,,"Superficially, I can see why you draw this analogy. Open-source programmers make their code freely available, but companies can still profit by providing support. Everyone happy.<p>But we need to remember why this model works. Programming is a relatively highly paid job. A programmer who works for a decade or so can afford the opportunity cost of doing unpaid work. The average musician, on the other hand, works at a pub!<p>Second, look at who are the purchasers of software support. These are invariably companies with deep pockets. Had they not purchased the open-source solution (which is cheap on account of that good samaritan programmer's efforts!) they would have purchased the equivalent closed-source solution, at a greater cost. Compare this with merch in music: the customers here are just individual consumers. And the typical pattern here is you go to a gig, and the first chunk of your money goes to your ticket, next to drinks, and if you have money left over, then you <i>might</i> buy a t-shirt (I'm musician, and was told by a professional manager [she works for the company that manages Amy Winehouse] NOT to buy excessive amount of merch -- she said that it was the weakest link; the one thing the customers really could afford to do without).<p>I agree with your second point regarding the difficulty of making money doing original music. It really saddens me, but c'est la vie I guess: not everyone loves music, and live music at that, as much as me. Demand is what it is. But what really galls me is filesharing, because in that case, the price is <i>artificially</i> zero. It is zero because there is not property enforcement. And that, frankly, sucks.",1245146140

659852,comment,658629,658823,0,0,seertaak,,,"All you've pointed out is that the costs of production have fallen. Big deal! It doesn't matter if production prices fall 50 or 80 percent: if revenues are zero, then the musician is still screwed.<p>Whether or not production costs fall to zero, a musician still needs to eat food. The OP is complaining that in the presence of widespread filesharing the price inevitably falls to zero. This is not some kind of new technological reality that we must accept! It is a reality brought upon by the lack of respect for property rights! If Portobello Road market were not policed, and were <i>known</i> not to be policed, does anyone here seriously doubt that theft would become widespread? Sorry, but people have a tendency of being a bit cheeky if they know they can get away with it (though whats worse is when to the cheek, self-serving rightousness and finger-wagging [evil capitalist labels! evil evil labels!] is added).<p>People keep saying that the crux is that distribution is free in electronic form. That's true, but it's no more relevant that pointing out that the sun that allows an orange tree to grow is free --- it is far from being the only cost. Releasing an album is an expensive business -- it requires a concerted advertising and publicity campaign. These types of campaigns are not cheap. Widespread filesharing decimates potential profits because many of those that otherwise would have the album don't. So it doesn't matter if the filesharer personally ""profits"" -- he is still harming the artist, because some portion of his disposable income that should have gone to the artist (after all -- the consumer did <i>listen</i> to the music) didn't.",1245144955

If the application is sufficiently complex to require programming or a database, which is true of just about any non-trivial app, then the user is savvy enough to host apps for free in several cloud hosting services with very easy deployment.  If we're just talking about file or photo sharing, then there are other services like Dropbox that work well and don't require constant connectivity and compute power on the client side.<p>I'm typically a fan boy of new tech, but other than a nice proxy service, I don't see why this is revolutionary or game changing.  Time will tell, but if there really is a market for something like this, it'll be served by a really cool and simple app development tool which autosyncs to a cloud.  Building the app in a brain-dead way is the chokepoint for people coming up with personal apps, not the server infrastructure (at least now in 2009).

There's a reason we use servers -- 24x7 availability with network redundancies, backup power, etc, etc.  Most hackers I know can run servers off their local box by using either static IPs from their provider or a proxy service.  But many don't because of the reasons above.  And now that there are so many great (mostly free) turnkey hosting services like App Engine and Heroku, it's never been simpler to offload all the server issues to a cloud.<p>The main target audience for this would be users who can't use any of the cloud hosting and also don't need high availability.

My expectations were that we would be on one side of a glass window and the computer would be on the other, but no - we walked right up to one that was being tested for delivery, serial #5 I believe it was. They were obviously proud of the cooling system - we were invited to put our hands on the side panels to see how cool it kept. The wire maze on the inside of the &quot;C&quot; was incredible, one trip would have caused an immeasurable amount of damage.<p>Unfortunately we only met Seymour for a short time, obviously he was quite busy. Even more unfortunate is that I don&#x27;t remember much of that meeting. The only tidbit I remember clearly is him pointing to a pumpkin on his desk. His daughter had grown it in the garden, and knowing he was already thinking about a Cray 2 machine decided it should be named the &quot;Cray 3&quot;.",1399690697

When you have an extremely high read volume against such data sets, it can be economical to cache the entire data set and distribute it periodically to the fleets of machines that require access, as opposed to servicing individual reads over a network. Provides lower cost and latency, while supporting a higher volume of reads and higher availability, at the expense of engineering cost and propagation delay.",1399689921

To be honest, I think you&#x27;ll be fine with whatever tool you choose and I think you should just use whatever is most comfortable for you. That said, some scenarios where it might make sense to use Java (or another JVM language) over Django/RoR include:<p>(1) This doesn&#x27;t matter for most applications (and isn&#x27;t necessarily true for all applications), but if you are expecting a lot of load you will likely get more throughput out of the JVM (see how the Java platforms compare to Ruby and Python ones in this benchmark: <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/</a>) and you will probably be able to handle more traffic with fewer machines (Twitter reportedly needs about ten times fewer machines to run its site after rewriting a bunch of Ruby services in Scala).<p>(2) You may need to use a particular JVM library (there&#x27;s a lot of really good ones).<p>(3) Some spaces of the open-source ecosystem are largely written with JVM languages (especially in the data space: Hadoop, Mahout, Spark, etc).

The soils of the great plains have literally decreased, by many feet, since farming and ploughing began in the mid-19th century.  Nutrients aren&#x27;t merely taken up by plants but are then transported off the farmland, to be eaten and dispersed.  Added nutrients wash away with irrigation water fouling rivers (don&#x27;t move along the lower Mississippi if you can help it) and forming offshore dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico, Yellow Sea, and elsewhere, due to algae blooms and oxygen starvation.<p>You&#x27;re ... well out of your depth and highly underinformed (or misinformed) on all these points.<p><i>Don&#x27;t forget we can make aviation fuel from energy plus air</i><p>I&#x27;ve addressed that multiple times elsewhere on this post. I see seawater rather than air as a CO2 + H2 feedstock as being much more viable.  It&#x27;s still <i>tremendously</i> energy intensive, and my estimate is that replacing present US petroleum consumption would likely cost ~$16 - $24 trillion between the fuel synthesis and energy inputs.  I consider that plausible (amortize the costs over 40 years, roughly $2000 per man woman and child at the low end, about 4% of GDP over that period).

It&#x27;s worth reading, and worth thinking about how it could have been differently so as to be more conclusive, and how a followup study might be improved.<p>1) There is no mention of whether the people caring for the bees were blinded as to control versus treatment.  This is simple, and should have been done if it was not.<p>2) There were only 6 hives in each treatment group (control, imadacloprid, and clothianidin).  There are always constraints, but more hives would be a much stronger study.<p>3) Lu&#x27;s previous study found 100% mortality with 1/7th the dose of imadacloprid.  Why did they increase the dosage for this experiment?<p>4) There are 3 apiary locations, but they don&#x27;t report the breakdown per apiary.  Did all the apiaries experience approximately equal losses in the neonicotinoid hives?<p>5) Is there a &quot;file drawer&quot; effect here?  If there had been one fewer treatment hive collapse and one more control collapse, would this study have been published?<p>6) Were any other studies performed?  Or started and abandoned?  I&#x27;d presume not, but it would be great to have a clear statement from the authors.<p>7) Is it reasonable to assume that the dosage is spread evenly across all bees?  If the clothianidin LD50 is 3.4 ng/bee, and they are administering .74 ng/bee/day, it seems likely that some bees will die from acute poisoning.<p>8) They don&#x27;t breakdown the numbers per hive, and instead give averages that include abandoned hives.  Were the surviving non-abandoned neonicotinoid hives any weaker than the control hives?<p>My hope would be that the authors would provide the full data if requested, but I&#x27;m constantly surprised that journals don&#x27;t require this.   Without additional information, this seems like an interesting exploratory study that neither confirms or denies any specific hypothesis.<p>I&#x27;d guess that there are enough beekeepers interested in future studies that a larger scale study would be possible.   Many bees are fed over the winter with sugar, to compensate for the honey that is taken.  Do you suppose that there are  beekeepers that would agree to a blind dosing of their bees if the lab were to provide the (possibly poisoned) sugar?",1399688709

Java&#x27;s type system is mostly bookkeeping and doesn&#x27;t help you functionally really at all while taking a lot of effort to deal with at the programmer end. By contrast there are much more powerful type systems where the typing takes much less effort AND delivers you actual functional benefits. Crucially Java&#x27;s generics are not preserved through to runtime, so there is no actually difference between List<Integer> and List<String> to the JVM, only the compiler. If there was a difference all sorts of powerful things could be done with the types at runtime, but as it is it&#x27;s mostly just the compiler complaining about whether you dotted i&#x27;s and crossed t&#x27;s.<p>I program a lot in Groovy these days, and it now has optional static typing with a limited amount of type inference. What I observe is that I voluntarily prefer to type my variables much of the time because it really does save time and takes only a fraction more effort than leaving them untyped.

4608403,comment,4607393,4608120,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"CTRL next to A was, I believe, its original location.  That's where it was on the Teletype Model 33, which dates back to 1963, and I'm not aware of an earlier keyboard that had a CTRL key.<p>In the 1970s, most terminals continued with this placement.  I believe the modern practice of putting Caps Lock there came in with the first IBM PC -- copied, of course, from their typewriter keyboards.<p>Being a longtime Lisp Machine user, I had that key mapped to Backspace on my Unix workstations into the late 1990s, but I couldn't do that remapping on my PowerBook, so I gave up -- it was too confusing to have Backspace in different places on different machines.  (I think the remapping is actually possible with OS X, but I've never bothered.  It's certainly possible with Linux.)",1349283546

4608401,comment,4607747,4608129,8,0,rogerbinns,,,"I'd add two other things to fix too.  The first is housing.  It is not a triumph every time the cost of housing goes up.  That just diverts funds that could have been spent on other things into housing, makes it considerably more expensive to move, and reduces the runway given a certain amount of funding.  We would all be better off if houses were $1 each not $1m each.<p>The second is the pitiful broadband available all over the country.  With better broadband it is far easier to take advantage of contributors all over the country.  Telepresence would allow collaborators to feel as though they are in the same room, and is best served by high bandwidths.  Data files keep getting larger so it helps there too.  And if you are using a remote computer displaying locally then again it is best served by higher bandwidths (and lower latencies).",1349283537

It obliges the country to educate the immigrant's kids for free for 13 years each. It obliges the country to extend its social welfare programs to the immigrant and his family. It's reasonable for the country to want to control what obligations it incurs. You act like its risk-free for the host country, but it's not. You consider the immigrant who gets a job and pays taxes, but what about the ones that fail to get jobs and need welfare?",1349283361

Apple has been steadily replacing things like processors with their own designs but this certainly isn't because of some petty offense they've taken to Samsung entering their market.  It's because it's in their best interest to design their own parts (especially long term).  Apple does come off as being emotional about Android with the decisions they've made (especially Maps) but implementing their own Maps and other features of their phones themselves is a good long term business plan.

It illustrates what I believe is wrong with RSpec: the assertion style is completely disconnected from the API that is being tested. There's no way you can tell what methods are being called on the `collection` object without being intimately familiar with <i>this specific</i> RSpec matcher.<p>So what does that line actually do? Apart from calling strange methods like `items` on strange objects like `have(2)` in the end the test passes iff `collection.length` equals 2. Compare RSpec with classic test/unit assertions:<p><pre><code>    collection.should have(2).items

    assert_equal 2, collection.length

The second line is just so much more obvious to me.<p>On the other hand I really like the RSpec way of grouping tests and structuring test cases. My favourite test cases are written with minitest/spec (a lightweight test/unit-compatible clone of RSpec) and test/unit-style assertions.",1349283228

    >   success: Spy('makeRequest', {wait: true}),

The example and output was parsed essentially by regexes.  That was kind of okay, but I'm much happier with the new comment-based format.  But that depends on parsing the language itself, so it's nontrivial to add other languages (before I only had to replace eval).<p>Still, supporting CoffeeScript shouldn't be a big task, it would just require abstracting out some of the parsing, and having a way to select the language (probably just another CSS class on elements, and/or the page body).  The only parsing doctest really cars about is chunking the text by comment.<p>In regards to abbreviated examples: you can write your test in one big chunk, and I like to do this when I'm really <i>testing</i> and not <i>explaining</i>  doctest.js is not intended to just be a documentation tool.  But if you are composing docs, then doctest will only test things that are explicitly marked to be tested.  It's not as strict as Python's doctest, because it's using essentially invisible information to determine what's a test (a CSS class).  You can also have it test things that aren't visible in the docs themselves, but are necessary to create a usable environment for the tests.<p>Of course a lot of things, like makeRequest, are only interesting if you handle the async aspect of the code.  Spy() is handy for testing, but will look peculiar in documentation.  It occurs to me that for documentation you might want:<p><pre><code>    makeRequest({
      url: 'http://example.com/endpoint',
      data: 'foo',
      success: function () {
        print('I got a response:', this.status);
      },
    });
    // (later) => I got a response: 200
</code></pre>
Where ""(later)"" tells the test runner to wait for at least <i>something</i> to be printed out.",1349282933

I thought I could bypass the whole educational process and join the workforce directly. Turned out, I was wrong. When the company went through the visa process, they figured it's not possible to give out H1-B visa to foreigners without bachelor's degree.

... Yep -- this is probably the main complaint raised when talking about tools like Docco or Markdown-as-source-code as ""literate programming"". But, it's a concern that I believe is entirely outdated. Modern dynamic languages make it easy to sequence your code as you like. The methods in a class may be listed in any logical order, helper functions can be listed in an appendix after the functions that make use of them, and so on. I find it hard to imagine an example where changing the order of the codebase would make the prose version more readable -- and wouldn't <i>also</i> make the code version more readable as well.<p>I think that, unfortunately, the tangle/weave paradigm is a large part of why literate programming is barely used -- it introduces an entire level of build-time complexity that doesn't have any direct effect or benefit on your code. Here's hoping that the simplicity of having a file that is at once both executable code and publishable markdown is something that feels more usable to more programmers.",1349282019

If so, how long?<p>- Are ISP's required to make records public or offer them to 'enforcement companies'?<p>Basically in the US, the RIAA and others who were/are suing people based on internet activity are doing so under the belief that a person is responsible for all activity under an IP (1 IP = 1 Person). So they track a download to an IP, get the customer from the ISP, and file a lawsuit with the customer as the defendant. I _think_ most of those lawsuits have been thrown out or settled. Generally, you'll need more evidence than a public IP address to take someone to court.<p>We all know very well that a public IP address isn't an accurate way to identify someone. For example, you can torrent at most local coffee shops, libraries, schools, etc. Do you think that school keeps a log of all it's private IPs issued, tied to students, faculty, or others? Do ISPs really keep records of issued IPs for decades?

There are also weird corner cases caused by long-term illegal/undocumented presence by children, which is what the DREAM act is supposed to address -- a child who was brought here shortly after birth, who grew up a US citizen, graduated high school, college, etc., really doesn't seem the same as an adult who recently and of his own free will crossed the border.<p>Part of it is racial/racism, but a lot of it is economics; trying to paint enemies of mass unskilled immigration or immigration amnesty as just racists is doing everyone a disservice.  But it's also undeniable that the high-skill immigrants with problems are generally from India and China (where the H1B system is most broken due to nationwide quotas) and from other parts of Asia, Europe, etc., and the illegal/low skill immigrants are largely from Mexico, Guatemala, and other Latin American countries.<p>There is also some confusion about credentials vs. actual skills, too -- I'd rather bring Bill Gates in than most people with BA's from diploma mills or even legitimate PhDs.<p>The problem with comprehensive reform (as championed by the democrats and Obama) is that it's all or nothing, vs. incrementally solving each class.  The proponents of comprehensive believe (probably rightly) that solving the most obvious and pressing problem (the 1 million or so skilled immigrants who are all currently legal) will take away the drive to solve the 12 million unskilled/illegal immigrants already here, or the many million who would immigrate without skills if it were easy and open.  It would also quite possibly lead to a more restrictive regime for the unskilled vs. skilled.<p>Ultimately we seem to be solving the immigration problem by destroying the US economy (outside high tech and government, neither of which employs a lot of illegals), thus depressing wages and job opportunities for illegal/unskilled immigrants, while mexico continues to develop its economy -- it makes more sense to work there legally for 10% the cost of living and 30% the wage in many cases.",1349281184

4608094,comment,4606679,4606679,1,0,jcr,,,"1.) My first compound question would be (as it has been in the past),
""What are some good texts? And for what levels? (beginner, intermediate,
advanced?)""<p>For example, I've been eyeing the following two books since they're
commonly used, but of course, commonly used is not a guarantee they're
any good.<p>James Stewart  2011  Algebra and Trigonometry 3rd Ed  ISBN:0840068131<p>James Stewart  2011  College Algebra Concepts and Contexts  ISBN:0495387894<p>As usual with university texts, we're dealing with the variance in
""required material"" and preferred teaching style for particular courses
along with the textbook mafia exploiting the differences in opinions
with multiple overlapping titles. I wouldn't quite call the multiple
versions of the same material ""cut-and-paste textbooks,"" but they're
still really close.<p>Sure, I've got the luxury of revisiting fundamentals for fun even though
I don't necessarily need to revisit them again. As expected, when done,
I'll probably have my own uneducated opinion of how good those texts are
at teaching the basics, but that's beside the point -- You have the
clear advantage of having far more experience with math, and hence,
you'd have a much more informed opinion of good texts.<p>1.a) ""Other references or resources besides textbooks?""<p>2.) My second question would be, ""Why limit it to just `Linear Algebra`?""
This could be my own academic ignorance showing through or possibly a
language barrier of some sort, but there are so many different and
useful applications of ""Algebra"" that limiting it to a specific area
seems, well, overly confining and constrained.<p>If you're just trying to be humble and only stick to stuff you know
really well, I can empathize. There are a lot of smart math folks on HN,
and some of them know particular fields extremely well, so venturing
outside of your field of expertise can be a risky proposition. On the
other hand, I know you're damn good at a lot of different fields of
mathematics, so even if you aren't <i>the</i> resident expert of a particular
field, your insights can still be very useful and beneficial --A good
example is me asking you about textbooks even though I know you don't do
the whole regular teaching thing, let alone spend your time evaluating
each new edition and variation of books for the sake of potentially
using them in a class. If someone wanted to know more about the
application of Algebraic Theory to Automata Networks, your opinion is
still a hell of a lot more informed than mine. (And no, I don't really
understand it... yet!)<p>3.) If you want to stick to the topic of just Linear Algebra, ""Where is
Linear Algebra useful?"" The pure math folks are always amazing, but the
engineering types want to know how to apply the knowledge to do useful
work. The first step is simply knowing where things could be useful.<p>3.a) ""Why is Linear Algebra useful in particular areas?""<p>The things you consider to be ""completely elementary"" or even blatantly
obvious, probably aren't. I'd bet the reason why this submission hasn't
resulted in a whole lot of questions is due to people being afraid of

I'm a left of center person here in the U.S., and my time in the deep south has made me keenly aware of how horrible the excesses of conservatism can be. However, my time in liberal areas of the nation (northern California, Massachussetts, etc.) has shown me how horribly wrong the classic ivory tower liberalism can go also.  I don't dislike people victimized by discrimination.  I just dislike systems in which discrimination is fixed by more discrimination.  I also recognize how horribly wrong nanny state laws can go.<p>Look at California's renter protections.  They go way, way beyond reason in dragging out an eviction process.  As a result, people who would otherwise rent out properties do not, or do so at a much higher price to ensure that only high income people move into said properties.  By protecting the poor people from landlord abuses, the result is that decent poor people who pay rent are punished by the indecent poor people who abuse the system and take advantage of squatter rights.  Protections always, always come with a cost, hidden or not.  I don't think (like Randians do) that this cost should ALWAYS be avoided and we should all go the path of John Galt fantasy land.  I just think that too often, ivory tower liberals (by this I mean people who don't work in the private sector and confine themselves to academic and gov't advisory roles) don't see the costs of the protections they chase after, or don't consult with industry to find out what they truly are.<p>I will be voting for Obama this November.

While the margins of error of these numbers overlap, they nonetheless indicate that immigrant-founded companies dynamic period of expansion has come to an end."" Okay, so the change in percentage is within the standard error of measurement; a percentage change of that kind would be seen even if there were more immigrant-founded companies than ever, as long as more native-born Americans than ever found companies; and there is NO indication that Silicon Valley's flood of innovation has ceased.<p>What is the problem here? Quantitatively, what is the proof that any policy change is needed?<p>AFTER EDIT: Responding to the offense taken by the replies kindly posted below, let me explain my position. My PERSONAL position on immigration to the United States as a matter of policy is that I would be happy to see it go back to the way it was in the 1870s, when anyone could immigrate from anywhere with hardly any regulation of immigration at all. All of my ancestors arrived in the United States by those rules--all of my ancestors were in North America well in advance of the building of the immigration processing station at Ellis Island in New York City.<p>I am intimately familiar with United States immigration law, having formerly worked as an immigration lawyer (as described in my user profile here on Hacker News) and being the husband of a first-generation immigrant to the United States from Taiwan. I have lived abroad for six years of my life (in two separate three-year stays), so I have a pretty good idea of how one country treats foreign residents from America. The clients for my current occupation, teaching mathematics lessons through a local nonprofit organization, included first-generation immigrants from China, India, Russia, Romania, the Philippines, Korea, Ghana, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, and other countries I may be forgetting at the moment. I like immigrants, and I like America to be full of immigrants--that makes life here more interesting.<p>But to persuade the legislative process in the United States to change the rules requires more convincing evidence than the anecdotes that Vivek Wadhwa repeatedly brings forward. Another comment here astutely pointed out that the recent trend line in immigration from Taiwan is that entrepreneur immigration to the United States is decreasing. That's because Taiwan has democratized, liberalized, and prospered during my lifetime. Now people who were born in Taiwan can pursue their advanced education in many different countries, being well prepared by the generally excellent primary and secondary education there, and then can decide for themselves where to settle to establish a career. They can go back to the country where they grew up and where their relatives and childhood friends live if they like. I think it's great for people to have choice like that. I don't think it is any problem for the United States at all if people from Taiwan develop their entrepreneurial businesses in Taiwan. The same is true of India and China. People from India and China continue to come to the United States in large numbers, as I can personally observe. Some study here and then go back to the countries of their birth. No one has made a case that United States policy has to change much to influence the numbers one way or another.",1349280123

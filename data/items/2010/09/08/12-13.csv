1671684,comment,1670692,1671585,0,0,raggi,,,"Yeah, I had already told Yehuda about the potential concurrency issues for apps switching over to this, as fibers are stacks and stack switching can lead to concurrency issues, especially dropping in a re-ordering of the render chain like this. He said this is another of the reasons it should be optional.<p>I'm surprised he didn't raise this in the article, but I guess the article was more about how it could work, than how it will in the final build, or how it should in all cases.<p>I've got to disagree partially, or at least present a different point of view about the 200/500 argument. It could be considered acceptable for the response to be a 200, as the server has not completely errored out, it is only a portion of the response that has errored, and at the application level. It seems that some apps would return a 500 in this case, and then render a page, suggesting that the server and app are broken. This is really something that could very quickly turn into a bikeshed discussion, but you can probably see my point even if you don't agree (I'm not sure I agree in all cases, but it is food for thought).<p>As you probably well know, I've been doing the async on rails and other frameworks game in ruby for about as long as anyone else that's publicly producing code in this arena (in ruby), and I have to say that this solution that they came up with is actually far better than most of the other hacks. It would be really nice if ruby had performant generators for yielding, but without them, we're left with less options. This fiber approach is getting us pretty close, and I think it's worth exploring, even if it turns out to be a bad idea for most people.<p>The Rack API won't really ever change significantly for the better in this arena. People don't seem to want to lose the simple #call returning a tuple protocol, and without making that either: a) asynchronous (in as much as not relying on a return value, but a call to a response object), or b) some significant changes to the contract for body, we can not really optimise many ways to provide both simplicity and reasonable levels of granular control of IO. ryah of node.js fame was writing an IO driven server years ago when I was first working on the async rack hack that is in thin, zbatery, rainbows and flow. We had a lot of discussions back then about how best to fit this stuff into the Rack API. We both desired to use something similar to Enumerator#next, but this would never fit much better into the existing setups, and as already noted, is not very performant by default.<p>As you say, this is not trivial, but I would argue that this means we need to experiment with more approaches, as neither of the currently presented solutions (my async api, and this fiber api) are ideal, nor is buffering large volumes of response data in memory, or taking a bigpipe / highly ajax style approach.",1283950788

You can do it on a page-by-page basis, just route URLs selectively to the new install.<p>Migrating data is something that should be done under only the most extreme circumstances - and something will inevitably go horribly wrong, so be prepared to rollback.",1283950621

If there's something in your stack which requires different status/header, you either need to evaluate it earlier in the request or hack around it by appending different HTML.<p>The more you decide to evaluate earlier, the less efficient becomes the flushing. So for every piece in the stack you have to make a choice: What is the chance that this requires different status/headers/content? How much do we gain by deferring? How can we hack around it if we've already started sending a response?<p>This is something you can't do automatically, and as far as I can see, this isn't mentioned in Yehuda's post <i>at all</i>.",1283948211

So here's my first question.<p>I realise this question may have already been asked, but we are launching a new product which will be the first product we are attempting to monetise. Ideally we want customers paying for the service on a monthly basis. Our first question was simply 'how much should we charge per month' which now feels rather naive without making other considerations. We have therefore started discussing pricing strategy.<p>I am particularly interested in how other HN'ers have tackled the launch of their product in respect of pricing. Has it been a gut feel type of thing, or have you invested a significant amount of time in creating a pricing strategy and, for example, related the price of the service to the cost of the infrastructure and the expected number of customers?

Java is very fast and efficient once it's running, but initial start-up time is often slower than interpreted languages due to the JIT compilation, but servers rarely ""start up"". If you're really hitting a barrier with Java's performance, just as with other non-native languages, you can write the performance critical section in C.<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32q/which-programming-lan...</a>",1283947841

That's 1500 MWh per day. Over 10 years at 365 days per year gives a total of 5'475'000 MW*hours.<p>The loan was 737 MUSD and let's assume that private investors will kick in the some to bring the total invest up to 1'000 MUSD.  If you ignore operating costs this gives an average cost per MWh of 182.64 $/MWh.<p>The average cost of electricity in the US south west was around $40 MWh (<a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/wholesale_markets.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/wholesale_mark...</a>).<p>This would indicate that the payback period for such a project must be longer than 10 years or that the expected cost of electricity will be higher in the future (or both).",1325577482

3418961,comment,3416777,3416777,0,0,dcrom,,,"What Americans are really ignoring is the idea that maybe someone can ""hack"" education for the better.<p>Numbers and anecdotes aside, we all know in our guts a few things that are beneficial to education:  studying more, decreased distractions, (parental) encouragement, high standards for technical subjects, and nurturing of creativity.  Every parent wants these things for their children.<p>The system in Finland has some of these things, but who cares why they have them?  You could copy some aspect of Finland and hope you get Finland's results.  You could copy some aspect of China and hope you get China's results.<p>We are trying to have the government build a model to explain WHY China's students study more or to explain WHY Finnish students have less distractions in the classroom.  Are you confident about the government's ability to model this?  I'm not sure I'd trust the world's best statisticians to figure it out.<p>The main point is that while everyone thinks they're an expert on how to get the above mentioned qualities into a school, simply finding a school that has them and then sending your child to it is a REALLY, REALLY easy way to get your child a good education.  However, under the current system, <i>you are discouraged from sending your child to said school</i>.<p>Suppose your friend used a government chalkboard for a relational database.  He's really upset about its performance.  He hears about Oracle's fast databases, so he adds an index etc to his chalkboard, since queries with an index are faster.  Maybe his chalkboard will catch up, and maybe it won't.  MySQL is down the street offering what he really wants (a cheap, fast database) but he doesn't want to use it.  He's worried that using MySQL will cause a decline in the quality of the chalkboards and leave all his neighbors with a piece of cardboard instead.  He would rather spend his time mimicking Oracle until his chalkboard gets fast, and trying to figure out WHY Oracle is fast.<p>Shouldn't he just let the innovative minds behind MySQL sell (or give away) what they've built, and just know that their product has all of the features he wants?  If it doesn't have what he wants, then he can use his chalkboard.<p>Are we all really afraid of that? An educational process is technology too, even if it's not software.  This community is in love with software that solves problems, but is very cautious of schools that can solve problems.",1325576753

3418944,comment,3416777,3417582,0,0,qdog,,,"Oh get out of here with your facts, everyone ""knows"" how bad the US education system is.<p>Part of the deal is the US is not at all like most other countries, I've mentioned we provide public schooling for all children, which some countries don't.  The US is also very large and diverse.  Texas, for instance, is generally quite low on the public educations scores for public schools overall, but some of the best schools in the entire US, regardless of public or private, are public schools in Texas!  You just have to live in the right school district, which almost always mean you live in the right family with a lot of money.<p><a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/features/2011/americas-best-high-schools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/features/2011/americas...</a><p>I'm not sure about the #1 and #2 schools, but further down, 
Highland Park in Dallas and Westwood and Westlake in Austin are all public schools.<p>I think it is almost impossible to have a good talk about education on HN, because we are essentially part of the 1% as far as abilities go, and most of us probably got along fine in school with any effort (or even no effort).  So the bias tends to be against education.  However, I've now had a son who is dyslexic, and the lack of good options even for people with money is dissapointing.  The US school system is still very good for the top of the class, it's the bottom that gets let down.  At any school system of any size that I've encountered (and I haven't been to very poor inner-city school), opportunities for the smart kids are always there.  It's the rest of the kids that are going to struggle, and those that can't find the motivation.",1325576218

Even within the ""white European"" demographic bucket there's huge variation among ethnic groups - most relevantly regarding attitudes toward education itself, teachers, and relative levels of funding or social priority given to either.  Treating US whites the same as European whites is wrong on a whole bunch of levels.  For one thing, we're <i>not</i> all white.  For another, the American population is drawn from specific subsets of the European population, and has experienced different patterns of population change since then (particularly evident wrt Jews with their known unique educational profile).  Lastly there's the fact that even if non-whites aren't included in the sample their effects are still felt because many white students still share schools with non-whites, and not a few of those ""white"" students in fact have mixed heritage.<p>Of course, treating ethnicity - and particularly just white vs. non-white - as the only variable other than the educational system itself is itself offensive.  One might also consider the effects that 300+ years of distinctly US culture and history have had on attitudes toward education, teachers, or the relative social/economic priority accorded to either.  Or the effects that wealth distribution within the US or wealth differences between the US and other nations might have.  The US student body is simply not the same as the Finnish one, so if Sanandaji really wanted to isolate the effect of the educational system then he'd have to adjust for more than one other variable.<p>Alternatively, he or you might take note of the fact that the current Finnish results are the result of change to the system while holding demographics relatively constant.  What works in Finland might not work in the US for all sorts of reasons, but claiming that it won't work specifically because of ethnic makeup is both intellectually and morally dubious.",1325574567

I will not enable JS to do so.<p>I have marked several mailing lists, like Postgresqls, as spam.  I tried to unsubscribe from that particular one for 10 minutes then gave up.<p>If you are sending emails that people don't want, even if they asked for them in the first place, you may as well be spam.  I hope my actions eventually lead to admins being more selective with emailing.",1325574461

It's damn affordable for that kind of service.<p>We even use Tilemill's underlying node.js framework, Bones, for some of our projects.",1325574420

Learn More""<p>I read the learn more page, there's nothing about violating privacy laws, switching to the timeline so that ads are more compelling, etc. Only after you've signed up to Facebook do they tell you that they've created this ""free"" service as a way to get your personal information so they can sell it to advertisers, or use your likes to sell stuff to your friends.<p>I've still never been told by Facebook that they violate PIPEDA and European data laws.<p>Went to Google, no mention of using your click stream and browsing habits to sell you unwanted ads, and worse, no way to turn them off.<p>Seems like it's industry standard practice to offer a ""free"" service so that you spend your time giving data to a company so they can sell it to advertisers. Apparently these companies have employees to pay and servers to buy so can't offer you a completely free service with out getting something from you.<p>Do I care? Not really, Facebook, Google, get my data, I get a service.",1325574250

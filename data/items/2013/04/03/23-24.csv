I absolutely agree that going to college for four years will not make you into a good artist. But ""being born with it"" will not make you a good artist either.<p>Hammering away at it two hours a day from age 12 to 22 will make you a good artist. You may never be a great one (that is where being born with it comes in). But you will be a good one. And the same is true for most pursuits.<p>There was a great forum post a while ago where some guy could barely put together a stick figure and three years later (after an hour a day, every day) he was making oil paintings that people would actually pay for. I can't remember where though. Anyway, that sort of thing has nothing to do with talent. It's hard work and sticking to it.",1365033594

What regimes have murdered in the name of openness? And let's not mistake what regimes claim to do with what they actually do. China's Great Leap Forward waved equality as a banner, yet I don't see the resulting horrific famine as being a reason to roll back civic rights in America<p>Edit:<p>I read this passage a couple but cannot figure out what it means -- the OP is describing how open source arose from the free software movement:<p>> <i>The problem was that companies could sell free software, but they weren't always happy about the public mucking around in their code and changing it. So O'Reilly helped a group of entrepreneurs come up with the alternative term ""open source"" software, which described a bunch of different licenses that people could use to release software in ways that free software would not allow. You might say that open source allowed companies to release code that was partly open, but partly closed.</i><p>O'Reilly already weighed in pretty effectively...but the OP must be referring to <i>something</i> that happened in reality...right? Was there a company that got into open-source because it was tired of how the public could just go ""mucking"" about in their code base without reservation? What does that even mean?",1365033500

My wage jumped BLOODY FIVE FOLD (I am not kidding).<p>Now that I am back working with games, I am earning half the money I was (some people might ask: why you are doing it? it is because I love doing what I do... and I won't switch unless someone offer me like 6 figures USD).<p>Beside the huge pay gap, the game industry is also very toxic, full of crunch, and full of jerks. Some people say it has rampant sexism. It is not sexism, actually most guys are not sexist at all (actually it is easier to find white knights than misoginists), but it is filled with jerks of all kind, noone is safe, NO ONE. You will get bullied for being female, male, black, white, asian, red hair, black hair, bad teeth, too good teeth, rich, poor, too good Team Fortress 2 skills, too bad skills, not liking Minecraft, liking Minecraft... People will just hate you, period. It would be like living and working with 4chan 24/7 (or just look at the most popular game forum: NeoGAF)<p>And finally, making games is HARD, DON'T do it because you think you like games you will like it, you will not, there are lots of boring tasks and crazy tasks. Do it only if you like what you have to do (or if you are good and can tolerate it).<p>Also, as consequence of making games being HARD, expect failed projects, companies, jobs, even marriages, game industry has lots of those.<p>And remember, although making games pushes you hard and forces you to learn a lot, you will find that your skills are quite unique and not much good for the rest of the market (With few exceptions of some specialities, like backend engineers or tool programmers), there are not much companies there wanting someone that can script levels in awesome ways, or that want a module file musician. And for coders, commonly in the game industry you might end learning Lua... Then good luck finding a non-game job that use that.<p>All that said, I can say...<p>Hell, I still love my job!",1365033218

5490061,comment,5488084,5488865,1,0,rayiner,,,"Here's the basic problem with tax code simplification: the thing you're trying to compute (income = net change in wealth) is inherently complicated to compute. Sure, the special giveaways and whatnot don't help, but a lot of the special giveaways are also related to the theoretical understanding of what should be taxed.<p>Consider complications like calculating depreciation for capital equipment. All the schedules aren't there because of kicks--they're there because allowing an immediate deduction for an expense that creates a capital asset usable for years is just a mathematically incorrect way to measure ""net change in wealth"" when considering the time value of money. Other complexity comes from using discrete sampling periods (yearly tax returns) for what is a continuous phenomenon (changes in wealth). That's where things like net loss carry-forwards comes from. Other complexity comes from the intricacies of the ""net"" (versus gross) part of the equation. You can think of things like childcare deductions as a sop to the fact that childcare is something people buy so they can work, and thus not consumption.<p>The software analogy is really apropos. I'm pretty sure Windows is over 50 million lines of code at this point, and Linux is over 15 million. That's a million printed pages for Windows, and 300,000 printed pages for Linux. In comparison, the entire U.S. federal tax code is 73,000 pages: <a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3zoNtmhcQmE/T41zkm0VE6I/AAAAAAAAFMA/9ZLZXlHcI8M/s1600/2012-tax-law-keeps-piling-up-cch.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3zoNtmhcQmE/T41zkm0VE6I/AAAAAAAAFM...</a>.<p>Are Linux and Windows unnecessarily complex? Or is there just inherent complexity in creating an operating system that runs on everything from supercomputers to cell phones (Linux), or is bug-for-bug compatible back to the 80's (Windows)?<p>Don't get me wrong, the tax code should be simplified in every way possible. But when people say stuff like it only exists because ""we haven't stopped to consider what might be better"" that sounds a lot to me like the guy on every engineering team who wants to scrap the big, time-tested system and do a rewrite. Go to Microsoft, tell them that their system is just ""patch after patch"" and then volunteer to rewrite the whole thing. See what they say.",1365032916

It should be clear from the fact that no minors are involved in the creation of such cartoons that that is the case.  The point of these kinds of laws is to increase the power of the police to conduct searches or to arrest people, and to give prosecutors more power in plea bargaining and at trial.<p>The theory behind this kind of law is that the police are too limited by things like civil rights, and that prosecutors are too limited by our justice system; therefore, more laws must be passed to compensate for such restrictions on executive branch power.  The way our politicians view this issue, if prosecutors are unable to convict lots of people for possession of child pornography because of constitutional restrictions on evidence gathering or the fact that defendants are allowed to actually defend themselves in court, then the prosecutors must be allowed to tack more charges on.  After all, if a prosecutor is unable to build a strong case for one charge, they might still be able to convict a person by building a weak cases for multiple charges.  If a defendant believes they can successfully defend on charge, they might not believe that they can successfully defend many charges and will thus forfeit their civil rights and just take a plea bargain.<p>This is a troubling attack on our most important rights.  The fact that we cannot be arbitrarily thrown into prison is one of the things that makes America a great country.

Yes, it's a Rails problem that it is using large amounts of memory (on the other hand (2) isn't Rails specific at all, it applies equally to e.g. Node). But it's a Heroku problem that it gives Dynos just 512MB of memory. It's a Heroku problem that it doesn't have a good load balancer. Heroku is in the business of providing painless app hosting, and part of that is painless request routing. These problems may not be completely trivial to solve, but they're not rocket science either. Servers these days can hold hundreds of gigabytes of memory, the 512MB limitation is completely artificial on Heroku's part. Intelligent routing in groups is also very much achievable. Sure, it requires engineering effort, but that's the business Heroku is in.<p>Of course Heroku is under no obligation to do anything, but its customers have to justify its cost and low performance relative to a dedicated server. And most applications run just fine on a <i>single</i> or at most a couple dedicated servers, which means you don't have routing problems at all, whereas to get reasonable throughput on Heroku you have to get many Dynos, plus a database server. A database server with 64GB ram costs $6400 per month. You can get a dedicated server with that much ram for $100 per month. Heroku is supposed to be worth that premium because it is convenient to deploy on and scale. Because of these routing problems which may require a lot of engineering effort in your application it's not even clear that Heroku is more convenient (e.g. making it use less memory so that you can run many concurrent request handlers on a single Dyno).",1365031749

It's also hard to say though, because it looks like the volume of bitcoins traded today are equal or less than other days. I can't say for sure, because Mt. Gox isn't loading properly and I'm looking at an unfamiliar set of graphs.<p>People keep talking about the bubble bursting. Most people don't realize that last time bitcoin flopped, it only lost 30-50% value initially, returning to a value that was still higher than just 2 months before the crash. Bitcoin spent 5 months in a steady decline, not 5 hours. Most early speculators made a profit, even if they couldn't sell until after the crash.<p>As much insanity as people are predicting, everything will probably be drawn out. If you have bitcoins and are nervous, now is a fine time to sell. If you think bitcoin will keep going up and you bought more than 30 days ago, you will probably be able to come out ahead even if you are wrong.<p>But you have to appreciate that most of Bitcoin is speculation. Bitcoin seems safe because it is inherently deflationary. That brings an unproportionate amount of speculators to the currency, and causes the deflationary properties to exaggerate. After enough time, the currency will become clearly overvalued. The free market will take care of that in a cyclic fashion.<p>As long as Bitcoin is used by people for it's anonymous and cryptographic properties, it will be subject to this hyperdeflation/crash cycle. The exiting bits don't last long and ultimately don't make the currency gain or lose terribly extraordinary amounts of value. After a crash, I'm sure bitcoin will still be worth at least $60, which is still fantastic if you bought back when it was less than $15.",1365031086

Admitting that you have no idea why critical areas of your infrastructure is causing issues, while at the same time charging people an arm and a leg for services (we pay ~$4k/mo) feels like theft to me. I've built solutions for a large porn company that runs on significantly less infrastructure than what we are running on Heroku and handles 100x more traffic. Something is wrong here with the dyno/router model and maybe it is that you guys are just oversubscribed and not admitting to it in public.<p>Yes, autoscaling is hard. I have apps on Google AppEngine and see their issues as well. That said, at least they are trying. Maybe even take one of those 3rd party libraries and try to harden and adapt that and make it a real solution? I think the real problem though lies in the fact that there isn't any good metrics for what dynos are doing so there is no metric for when something is too busy or not. Yes, log-runtime-metrics puts out some numbers, but those numbers are meaningless when all I have is a slider to change the amount of money we are paying you.<p>I should qualify that git deploy compliment because there are issues with that as well. For example, why do you have to rebuild the npm modules from scratch each time? Why not have a directory full of pre-built modules for your dyno's that are just copied into my slug?

It's not any worse than your typical web standard polyfill, probably a lot better.)<p>* The language spec is standardized.<p>* People like Dart, and it becomes really popular for building web apps.<p>* We have great Dart<->JS interop and it's possible to make the two native VMs work nicely together in the same browser.<p>* The toolchain makes it practically impossible for a web developer to publish an app that only has .dart files, without the .js version that works on all browsers.<p>* At that point, it might make sense to add the Dart VM to a browser purely a performance optimization.<p>Of course a lot could change between now and then. For example, if JS engines keep getting faster and introduce enough fast stuff (like typed arrays, asm.js, etc), maybe we can achieve the speed we need with dart2js.<p>Fortunately, there are plenty of folks that work on Blink/Chromium that share both the enthusiasm and skepticism that the web community has about Dart. As someone that works on it, I deeply want our team to succeed, but I would like to see it happen in the right way--open web and open source friendly.",1365030148

6968728,comment,6966655,6967559,7,0,Zigurd,,,">  <i>Most apps are just buttons and pages and pictures and videos, and for that kind of stuff, I honestly don&#x27;t see what the advantage of native is over HTML.</i><p>This is true for very simple apps. But native platforms have developed UI conventions that should be followed for non-trivial apps, and modularity capabilities that should be exploited. Taking Android as the example:<p>Fragment is the way Android apps scale between small and large displays, and how such apps are modularized.<p>ActionBar is how commands for fragments are added to &quot;global&quot; UI elements as the Fragment objects appear.<p>The Share action is how data is moved in the highest-level, user-directed way; Intent and startActivityForResult is how apps borrow UI and capabilities from each other; bound service RPCs is how apps can call each other&#x27;s APIs. You can&#x27;t do that with Web apps.<p>Android arguably has a more powerful feature set for modularity and inter-app cooperation that has been held back from achieving its potential fro users because too many apps started with a Web app or an iOS implementation. Android also has UI conventions that are sophisticated and good-looking and that users will increasingly value apps for adhering to.",1388102347

For one, they&#x27;re not taught a specific language -- they&#x27;re given visual blocks to work with (and the ability to show the corresponding javascript).<p>I assume that without real instruction you&#x27;re not going to learn the theory, and yes someone will have to advocate for OSS, but it seems that the goal is more basic -- not to pump kids full of impressions that &#x27;this way is the only way&#x27; and  &#x27;just type code don&#x27;t think no think&#x27;.<p>One thing I noticed more from my sister than the hour of code was that thought processes for programming that we take for granted haven&#x27;t been implanted, and need to be taught. For example, my sister when faced with a path for the zombie to take would start by telling the zombie to move forwards many times then take a left... etc etc. Conditions and loops are introduced gradually and the idea that you would use a loop to do multiple things instead of just manually doing it is part of this.

Who do you think you are anyway?  Go design a product or do sales at a big conglomerate if you want pay grades, or go found a company by yourself if you don&#x27;t need the things you&#x27;ve already listed your cofounder as bringing, including a cozy relationship with a board.<p>If you can found a company and raise money for it by yourself, go ahead and give yourself a 2.5x equity raise up to 100% by getting the fuck out and doing so.  enjoy 100% of what you feel is 100%, since you feel your cofounder didn&#x27;t add shit to the mix, in your extremely personally centered opinion.<p>Everyone else here has it 100% wrong, IMO.",1388100228

This is only going to add a truckload of fuel to the already huge fire that is the confusion between computer science and computer programming.<p>But to be less pedantic, let&#x27;s actually focus on what this will entail.<p>First of all, &quot;learning to code&quot; is as ambiguous as &quot;learning a [natural] language&quot;. Not all natural languages are Latin, and not all programming languages are ALGOL.<p>Second, I am highly skeptical as to the intentions of this movement. Yet criticizing it is bound to get you labeled a cynic, a Luddite, an obscurantist or a combination of those. After all, teaching kids to code?

The sugar coating, the testimonials from everybody besides actual computer scientists and their setting of sex quotas and affirmative action to create the illusion of desiring equality.<p>Notice how they all focus on the code. They rarely even use the word &quot;programming&quot;. This should already set off an alarm.<p>As the proprietary software giants are standing by this, they are very likely to focus on proprietary platforms. They don&#x27;t talk about this, of course. It&#x27;s all about the code. About imagination, creativity and dreams. Have fun fulfilling your dreams on a locked down tablet with a TPM chip. The issue of software freedom, I believe, is more important than bashing instructions, which is a skill anyone can pick up, if they so desire. But there will be none of that. How many of these kids will be taught about GNU? I&#x27;m assuming none. But I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s going to be lots of Visual Studio and C#, plus iOS and Objective-C.<p>Ultimately, this will either drive away children from programming (depending on how it&#x27;s taught, but let&#x27;s face it: compulsory schooling is notorious for just how apt it is at sucking the life and fun out of learning... even more when Code.org is pushing for pay deductions on teachers whose CS classrooms consist of <40% females), or it will reduce the general quality of labor. Many will be uninterested, many will refine their skills, but many will become 9-to-5 enterprise monkeys as a direct result of this.<p>I really want to support this. I do. But it really keeps looking like learning to code is just a facade. Of course, the children will learn <i>something</i>, but the ulterior agenda and how their perception will be skewed is something distressing.",1388099319

That is simply not true. Charity is not just about throwing money at poor, it is a far more difficult job than say building a company. Working for profit is simpler where clear regulations, contracts are in place and a government which has an interest in making businesses work.<p>Charity is a different ball game, I remember I was in Pune-India when Bill Gates quietly flew there in his private jet sneaked into local red light area to meet the health workers and monitor the progress. No one knew about his visit, when media reached there his private security somehow managed to make him disappear. He had a review meeting with health workers and key government people, and then simply flew out. He does this in all the countries where no sane minded Billionaire would set a foot.<p>Throwing money and feeling good is simple. Achieving results is very difficult. Pune&#x27;s red light area has benefited immensely by his efforts. There are at least 3 NGOs who have successfully managed to reduce AIDs and help the children of prostitutes rehabilitate in better professions. Over last 10 years, the sex workers in this area have reduced.<p>Bill Gates is actually very stingy when it comes to money. You cant simply setup a NGO in red light area and get funding from him. The whole process by which he chooses whom to help is the real USP of his work. That is something takes a lifetime to build and he has done it well.",1388099309
6968551,comment,6965492,6965578,8,0,lambda,,,"It&#x27;s the difference between the movie industry and TV industry.<p>TV has always described resolution in &quot;lines&quot;, because only the vertical direction had a fixed number of lines, the horizontal was analog and thus there wasn&#x27;t a specific number of lines (there was a maximum frequency it could display accurately, and thus a minimum feature size, but no discrete &quot;lines&quot;). So, SD NTSC is 480i (i for interlaced), PAL is 576i. Actually, NTSC was really 525 lines, but some of them were not visible and part of the blanking interval. When you started moving into HD, they kept this convention, referring to 720p, 1080i, 1080p, etc.<p>When movies started being distributed in digital formats, the movie industry chose a different standard of naming the resolutions, calling it 2K for 2048x1080. I&#x27;m not sure why they chose to focus on the horizontal rather than vertical resolution like the TV industry, but there you go. So the 2K/4K terminology comes from the movie industry, 720/1080 from TV.<p>Just be glad that we&#x27;re using this term and not the computer industry term for it, which is WQUXGA (edit: sorry, QFHD, WQUXGA has 2400 vertical pixels, not 2160, see how memorable these names are?), though it is frustrating that &quot;4K&quot; is used for something that doesn&#x27;t actually have over 4000 pixels in either dimension. In fact, this doesn&#x27;t meet the official definition of 4K, it&#x27;s actually just 4 times the size of 1080p, so it would be more appropriate to name it 2160p or QFHD instead of 4K. But for some reason, 4K has become the de-facto buzzword for this generation of resolutions, so it&#x27;s what we&#x27;re stuck with.",1388099292

He probably can scale up your company from $10,000 rev to $100M rev like no one else.<p>Imho entrepreneurs normally aren&#x27;t good CEOs.

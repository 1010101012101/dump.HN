707449,comment,706711,706711,0,0,San,,,"About two months ago, one of my shoelaces broke. I was still three miles from home, and walking wouldn't get me back there in time. So I took off my shoes and socks, and continued my run. It felt a bit awkward at first, but after twenty strides or so my feet started to figure out the proper technique. After half a mile, I was able to really start running, and boy it felt great! (I made it home in time without any problems, except for some pretty sore calves the next day.)<p>Because it was such a great, joyful experience (and I still didn't get new laces), I've continued my barefoot runs. Yesterday morning I ran 10 miles (6 miles brick sidewalk, 4 miles sandy forest path), without any problems whatsoever. You do have to watch out for broken glass trough, so when I go between dusk and dawn I put on my aqua socks. But otherwise, I've found my bare feet to be incredibly resilient and wear-proof. Also, I am running completely pain-free for the first time in years. It does require some changes to your stride, most importantly not landing on your heel. But not being constrained by rigid running shoes anymore, your body is able to figure out the rest as you go.<p>In a few weeks, I'll be running the half marathon in my city. The self-conscious part of me wants to wear shoes and avoid the questions and strange looks. (You will get those, anything from people shouting ""Hey, you forgot to put on your shoes"" to others nearly walking into trees and lamp posts while staring at your feet in amazement.) But the Dvorak-typing, trackball-using part of me just want to do what feels best, regardless of any social standard, and go barefoot: zero pain, maximum joy.",1247726648
707448,comment,706657,706811,0,0,azanar,,,"I think GPA is a better measure of ""I can work inside a system and play by its rules""<p>Does having a high GPA indicate that this is what the person was trying to prove? Does it even suggest that following rules was the motivator that got them where they are? As I pointed out in my earlier comment, maybe the graduate's GPA was high due to motivations that had very little to do directly with wanting to achieve a high GPA or wanting to please other people.<p>The meaning is ambiguous; as are the meanings of <i>everything</i> someone might rely on to assess someone's ability. You need context to figure out what each individual indicator means, and this includes the GPA; it might mean absolutely nothing, or it might be the thing that pulls two or three other indicators out of ambiguity and makes the true ability of the person become more believable.",1247726247
707446,comment,706586,707155,0,0,pfedor,,,"Not just you.  I seems much more natural to me to think of an integral as ""continuous sum.""<p>You can often describe the exact same thing using a discrete sum or an integral, e.g., in a classical mechanics class you first consider a system of N connected springs, and a number of properties (like, say lagrangian, energy etc.) of the system will be expressed as sums with N terms.  Then you take the continuous limit, the connected springs become one string and voila, all sums become integrals.<p>In quantum mechanics for some systems the set of all energy levels is discrete (e.g., the harmonic oscillator), for some it's continuous (e.g., a free particle), and often it is part-discrete part-continuous (a hydrogen atom.)  Many formulas will require you to take a sum for the discrete part and an integral for the continuous part.  Some quantum mechanics textbooks introduce a special symbol, a capital sigma overlaying an integral symbol, which means ""integrate or add, whichever appropriate.""",1247726192

707442,comment,707014,707014,0,0,tetha,,,"Ok... At first, a disclaimer: Yes, I program Test first about all of the time (Acceptance tests first, unit tests later), and yes, I do consider this approach better than not writing the tests earlier. (About every nontrivial test tends to fail around 0-3 times during development. Every failing would be a headache later on). 
So, what are his points?<p>- Extra, often useless up-front development
This paragraph just makes less and less sense the more I read it. I think he is ranting against testing spikes, because spikes will get thrown away. Well, know what? Spikes are not tested. Spikes are written to see what is possible and thrown away after this.<p>- Development with blinders on
Well, his point is: you might develop the wrong thing with TDD. Well, duh. I write my tests in the wrong direction, and thus, my code is written in the wrong direction. Good. Throw the tests away. What remains is: my code is written in the wrong direction. Where are tests evil there?<p>- Tests are weighted more than the code
Here he shows that he has pretty much no clue about the second meaning tests have (besides checking the code a bit): Interface design. By using your unit in a unit test, you can design your interface, and usually, it is easier to get the interface in a nice, usable way, because you are using it already. Thus, if you write the test first, you first think about the interface of a unit (or, at least a small part of it) and later on, you implement this. So, is it bad to think about nice, clean interfaces first?<p>- Coding yourself into a corner
This is another of those points of the kind 'Your development practice is bad, because you might end up in a dead end'. I hate those points, because they are so general that they can be made about ALL development practices, unless you are god.<p>- Narrowly applicable uses
I can 'just' test drive my libraries, datastructures and such? Well. That is a very, very bad 'just'. I watched my brother went nuts when he was working on a compiler with several optimizations heavily based on binary decision diagrams. Eventually, I was able to convince him to just write a bunch of automated tests for this datastructure. He wrote them, found several bugs and everything was done in a few days. 
So, reiterate: testing the foundation of your application can be of gigantic value, far, far more than his 'just' allows, because, if the foundation is broken or shaking, things break down in unexpected and hard to debug ways.<p>- Tests solve problems that don't exist
His point: Tests don't prevent all bugs in a software. Again, a point I can just answer with 'well, duh.'. The only thing which could prevent all software would be a correct formal verification of the program (which is surprisingly hard). So, this point simply holds for ALL real-life programming practices again.<p>- Scope creep
Point: Separation of concerns is bad? Management of Requirements is not well done in TDD? Well, if his point is the first one, he would just disqualify himself completely. If his point is the second one, his point is that some code creation strategy has no clue about managing requirements. Well, duh? Managing requirements is in the management area, TDD is in the area of coding things, so they are entirely orthogonal.<p>- Inefficiency
Yes, I have to give him this point. If you have tests, reworking things can take longer, if the product radically changes. It has to be noted that this radical changes are reached on the assumption of fauly requirement engineering, which will cause major problems with all other development methods either.<p>- Impossible to develop realistic estimates of work
His point: TDD has no clue about estimations. Well, duh. Estimation is, in the world of Kent and Extreme*, a management and planning problem, and a development strategy has no clue about planning and managing.<p>Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be one of those ""Do TDD or I whack you with a flyswatter""-guys. I am just a humble, fellow programmer who has learned that writing the right tests for the right components early can be a blessing. Certainly, writing the wrong tests or writing too many senseless tests can be bad, I give you that. Tests cannot make all bugs disappead, I give you that (I already had to track down some really nasty bugs which occured due to subtle assumptions which were not obvious from the tets). I also give you that you might write more code, and I give you that some things cannot be tested.
But please, give me that my tests catch a lot of stupid errors, like off by one errors, or mistypes. That my tests help me to define the interface I want to used, that my tests tend to encourage modularity, because modularity increases testability. That userstories, and the acceptance tests for them help me to guide myself where to develop to (and yes, once you have the userstory and the acceptance test, it is race-horse style ;) )",1247726025

It's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting: those where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have to solve a lot of nasty little ones. One of the worst kinds of projects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's full of bugs. Another is when you have to customize something for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs. To hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand cuts.<p>The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you don't learn anything from them. Writing a compiler is interesting because it teaches you what a compiler is. But writing an interface to a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the bugs are random. [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good hackers avoid nasty little problems. It's more a question of self-preservation. Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid. Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid cheeseburgers.""<p>from PG's ""Great Hackers"" essay.<p>PS: I don't claim to be a great hacker but I am probably a good one.",1247725430

High marks is an indication of a person's servileness? It can't be that they were fascinated by what they were learning, and as a result to perform well even though they didn't care that much about getting a high GPA, or have that much discipline or deference to authority? It seems there are two options here: do well and be branded as a servile, unmotivated toady who can't learn a damn thing on their own; do poorly, and be branded as an independent spirit who just might be brilliant depending on the results of further probing and research.<p>From this comment and its parent, it seems that colleges are being paralleled to boot camps, where the real goal isn't to develop knowledge and/or body strength and endurance, respectively, but to develop a psychology of doing what you are told instinctively. That you learned something along the way is completely immaterial, because that has nothing to do with the average you came out with. If you are capable of any independent thought, you would've known the material before taking the class, and scored low out of sheer boredom and apathy. Doing well shows you both didn't know the material before, and you were more interested in impressing upon someone else your knowledge of the material than actually learning anything at all.<p>If this is the case, I did it <i>completely</i> wrong. I suspect, however, that this is not the case, and that people are taking the metaphor of GPA to Obedience Average way too seriously. It <i>can</i> mean that, but it very much depends on the institution and the student, and probably a number of other variables.<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, my GPA in college was rather high. I will not say how high, because then the replies to this comment will be about that instead of the larger point. I worry just mentioning this much will dilute what I am saying, but not doing so seems disingenuous.<p>Conversely, I have been prodded by managers, coworkers, and friends repeatedly to be <i>more</i> disciplined, <i>more</i> respectful of authority, and <i>more</i> interested in pleasing people. I suspect I was this way in college as well, given the similar comments friends made there. Being too deferent has <i>never</i> been a problem for me.<p>Maybe I'm one of the outliers people discount to show a nice, clean correlation between two groups; it is merely misfortune that I am then rolled up into the correlation to suggest that I am as all the evidence I've gathered so far suggests I am not.<p>In all honesty, I'm not totally sure how I ended up with a high GPA. Maybe the institution I went to was too easy. Maybe my curiosity for the material I was learning was motivating in the same degree as the need to please authority was in the other high performers. Maybe that I had a curiosity for the material is a mark against me; it shows I was either curious about the wrong things, or not curious enough to learn it on my own without ""structure"" there to force it upon me. Maybe one or both are true. Maybe I, and those I know, <i>are</i> completely wrong about me.<p>I'm not saying either of you are wrong about what Joel is looking for by taking GPA into account. I'm not saying your right either. This is just about what high marks ""mean"" on their own. They can have more than one cause: it could be a sign of obedience, or it could be a biproduct of some other force that had nothing to do with the marks. The other metrics being taken into account will probably clarify which case it is.<p>Oh, and one other thing:<p><i>Coding a one loop bubble sort in hex blindfolded while juggling eggs, playing 12 games of chess, solving a 100 x 100 sudoku, providing an alternate solution to the 4 color theorem, teleporting tonights winning Powerball numbers, and cooking dinner would be a more applicable barometer.</i><p>Please, can we ease up on the machismo when discussing what makes for a great developer.

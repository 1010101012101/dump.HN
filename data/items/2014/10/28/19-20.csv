Occasionally, one of us works and succeeds alone, but, far more often, we work with others.<p>Human nature and how we treat, are treated by, and respond to our fellow humans is likely the single most important factor in any technology project. Indeed, in any team project. That&#x27;s not to say that all projects require the same approach to managing the team: Some work requires top-down command and control with explicit orders and consequences for disobedience, some is better done with self-selecting teams and kanban boards, and much is somewhere in between.<p>The common element is that the players have to know and respect the team&#x27;s organizing principle. Once upon time, it was command and control and strict orders for everything; everyone knew this was how it was done. Everyone worked within that.<p>Nowadays, establishing and maintaining an organizational culture, and articulating that culture, over and over again, are vital elements to any team work.<p>Many of us will read what this post and roll their eyes at this human factors bullshit.<p>Some of us will think &quot;Oh, yeah, that&#x27;d be good&quot;. (Some of us will mean that, others will express is sarcastically, imagining me with rose coloured glasses.)<p>Functional programming is YAHA (yet another human activity). Sometimes pursued alone, but sometimes in groups.<p>Some of those groups even manage to become communities. But are they inclusive or exclusive, and is that implicit or explicit knowledge? When I switched from Windows to Linux, I chose Ubuntu because it was explicitly inclusive with a clear code of conduct. Pissing on others strictly forbidden.<p>Some technologies succeed despite the way key players treat others. It happens. My guess is that most don&#x27;t.<p>How many forks are for sociological reasons, and not for technical or legalo-business reasons? (That last phrase is obscure, I confess: I mean things like the OpenSSO/OpenAM fork, for example: Forked because of a change in governance and ownership.)<p>In other words, how many times are projects forked because part of the community doesn&#x27;t like how the rest of the community conducts itself? How many projects fail because of how the community conducts itself?",1414526283

Basically, there are four cases:<p>1. oomkiller is on, and has no bugs in it. Great. We are all set.<p>2. oomkiller is off, process manager is on, and is bug free. Ditto.<p>3. oomkiller is on, but has bugs in it. Bad shit happens.<p>4. oomkiller is off, process manager is on, but has bugs. Bad shit happens.<p>Basically, the question is this: is it possible to develop a process manager that would do the job of oomkiller that has as high code quality as the Linux kernel. I am guessing the answer is yes, so we will always be hitting cases 1 and 2, or at least we&#x27;d be hitting cases 3 and 4 with roughly the same frequency.<p>Now, it&#x27;s possible that a process manager can fail for reasons other than bugs. Not knowing enough about how cgroups, oom, etc., I can&#x27;t say that you can write a 100% reliable (assuming it is 100% bug free) process manager without having kernel-level access. Perhaps there is something in the architecture of the whole thing that would prevent that.",1414526237
8523194,comment,8522032,8522284,0,0,exelius,,,"I completely agree with you that their service is awful and primarily geared towards sales. I also agree that they engage in price obfuscation in order to nickel and dime you to death: it&#x27;s really obnoxious and makes for an awful customer experience.<p>I&#x27;ll even agree with you that they are expensive (because they are). But they are expensive with good reason: a nationwide communications network is really expensive to run, and there&#x27;s no fair way to allocate costs.<p>When considering throughput / capacity on infrastructure, peak usage is all that <i>really</i> matters. In that sense, someone who goes on Netflix and watches 2 hours of video every night at 8-10PM costs you roughly the same as someone with torrents running 24/7. Some ISPs have resorted to data caps because they at least introduce the possibility that you might go over, which causes people to at least think about their bandwidth usage.<p>When all is said and done, telecom companies in the US are profitable, but not <i>insanely</i> profitable. This is the entire reason that Comcast is the sole broadband provider in many of its markets: the payouts (margins) aren&#x27;t big enough for another company to justify the upfront costs, except in a few profitable suburbs. If you look at cellular, where the big players DID overbuild in comparison to landlines, net margins STILL settled out close to 10-15% (not coincidentally, those are about the same as cable/landline.) And cellular is still awful, even though it is much more competitive than wireline.<p>Having worked at a number of big telecom companies, the vast majority of people who work at them have no exposure to any of the crap you&#x27;re talking about. I know it&#x27;s fun to generalize on the internet, but most people working at these companies are so far removed from anything regulatory or customer service related that it doesn&#x27;t bother them. Hell, most of them are consultants who don&#x27;t even work for the company.<p>Marketing is a hypothesis-driven steamroller: you test several variants of marketing material and see which one works best. The one that works best is probably the least honest one! So you go with it because your goal is to produce the most effective marketing material, not the most transparent. You probably don&#x27;t even know enough about the product that&#x27;s being sold to know you&#x27;re being dishonest.",1414526224

They try to create revenue-maximizing opportunities for themselves at the expense of their customers - although many non-geek customers may even like these siloed, suboptimal applications for want of a better understanding of how they could be using their devices. Nobody deliberately sets out to make their product worse, that&#x27;s a good way to lose customers to the competition. IT&#x27;s an unwanted side-effect of trying to extract more revenue from each customer.<p>This doesn&#x27;t preclude the companies from being greedy, negligent, compromising customers&#x27; security and so on. I agree that the <i>effect</i> of their policies is to create worse customer experiences. But to assume that their underlying <i>motivation</i> is make you unhappy is silly.<p>In gneral you&#x27;ll be much happier if you stop worrying about why people do stuff like this and just learn to firmly insist on what you want, eg &#x27;I purchased this unlocked phone because I do not like extra apps.

With that constraint, there is e.g. an isomorphism between integers and all needed reals and as such every observable property in the universe can be quantified using the integers.<p>It may seem that that would &#x27;invalidate&#x27; a lot of mathematical machinery, which uses concepts that can not be enumerated by the integers (i.e. the set of reals), but that need not be the case. The mathematical machinery we have developed may partly be a very effective &#x27;thought experiment&#x27;: what if the reals were uncountable?

I suspect you&#x27;re more reliant on ITA results than many other portals or meta-search sites and their prices are trivially easy to beat on competitive routes if you have a broader range of partnerships.<p>- Some consolidators put together logical itineraries not bookable via GDS or even direct with the airline. As an extreme example I once bought a cheap, logical pair of connecting long haul flights with Saudia via eBookers that Saudia&#x27;s website wouldn&#x27;t allow me to book at any price direct with them; I&#x27;d guess the airline didn&#x27;t want to market anything involving a 5 hour layover in an under-redevelopment terminal in Riyadh. There are plenty of less glaringly obvious potential indirect itineraries that consolidators (potentially including Kayak as well as their affiliates) can identify with Innovata&#x27;s minimum connect time file and schedule data[1] and other providers might have a more liberal view on reasonable connections than ITA<p>- Sometimes other sites&#x27; metasearch results&#x27; advantages are purely illusory, based on outdated results they&#x27;ve cached or screenscraped. I find Skyscanner LCC prices are frequently out of date, even though the actual ticket price is also usually cheaper than ITA&#x27;s. Other sites might also create the appearance of more choice by not combining codeshared flights into one.<p>As for LON-SYD on Monday Kayak has a lot more results under $1000 than you. It&#x27;s possible their much cheaper ticket prices with SIA are outdated or geolocation specific, but the cheapest flight they show (a Garuda two-stopper that&#x27;s no more obviously agonising than your cheapest result but 10% cheaper) doesn&#x27;t show on your engine at all.

A company like Google or Apple can make more than just a small dent.<p>From a macro perspective, the US has an aging population with the Baby Boomer generation entering older adulthood. Older population = greater health needs. Financially, it makes a lot of sense for a large company with vast resources like Google or Apple to make a splash in healthcare. And now&#x27;s the time to do it.<p>They also have a distinct advantage over startups when it comes to introducing change from outside the healthcare industry. They can withstand the long sales cycle that it takes to get approvals without needing to balance fundraising in the process. Not to mention their unique ability to reduce the length of those sales cycles. They&#x27;re more likely to win pilots and scale, and faster, because of their brand recognition -- a key competitive advantage when you&#x27;re talking about a risk averse space like the healthcare industry. Not to mention, you typically need to get a lot of stakeholders together (providers, payers, patients) and align incentives in order to get anywhere. Large companies have a huge advantage here and can influence change relatively quickly. Healthcare institutions are constantly discussing the need for technological disruption (and have the budget / financial incentives to foot it), but by nature they are highly risk averse to any major changes. Large tech companies are uniquely positioned.<p>SOURCE: I once worked on a healthcare startup, have been through a healthcare startup incubator program, have friends who are doctors and healthcare administrators, am familiar with healthcare investor thinking, and am connected to a spectrum of healthcare startups (both successful and early stage).",1414524028

The first time\n   a UA connects to a host, it lacks the information necessary to\n   perform Pin Validation; UAs can only apply their normal cryptographic\n   identity validation.  (In this document, it is assumed that UAs apply\n   X.509 certificate chain validation in accord with [RFC5280].)\n\n   The UA will not be able to detect and thwart a MITM attacking the\n   UA&#x27;s first connection to the host.  (However, the requirement that\n   the MITM provide an X.509 certificate chain that can pass the UA&#x27;s\n   validation requirements, without error, mitigates this risk\n   somewhat.)  Worse, such a MITM can inject its own PKP header into the\n   HTTP stream, and pin the UA to its own keys.  To avoid post facto\n   detection, the attacker would have to be in a position to intercept\n   all future requests to the host from that UA.\n\n   Thus, key pinning as described in this document is not a perfect\n   defense against MITM attackers capable of passing certificate chain\n   validation procedures -- nothing short of pre-shared keys can be.\n</code></pre>\nI think for most of us, this is still a big improvement.  But for people under repressive regimes, isn&#x27;t there a high chance that you get the MITM great-firewall-of-wherever the first time, and then you&#x27;re stuck with it from then onwards even if you can tunnel out at some later time (this is assuming the government has control over at least one CA)?",1414523225

I started my engineering career at 19 years of age because I was so deeply involved with my love for building computers (as in, from raw chips) that I could show the VP of Engineering at this one company that I was good hire.  I ended-up working there for ten years.  Everyone else in the department was at least ten years older than me.  One of the first things that was driven into my head by the &quot;elders&quot; was:<p>Always admit what you don&#x27;t know.  It&#x27;s the only way you will learn anything new.<p>To this day I always appreciate people who are relaxed and clear about what they don&#x27;t know (or are not sure about).  I know I can have conversations with them.  These people don&#x27;t tend to get defensive and are not insecure at all.<p>The other side of your statement is that, in some circles, if you assert what you do know you are instantly labelled &quot;arrogant&quot;.  If you categorically know something I have no problem if you make sure I understand that to be the case.  That&#x27;s just the way the cookie crumbles.",1414523160

Mathematics is only unreasonably effective at describing the subset of physical systems for which it&#x27;s unreasonably effective.<p>These are systems that are deterministic (or statistically so), linear, and generally well behaved. Things like the laws of motion, thermodynamics, heat transfer, and of course basic arithmetic all qualify as well behaved systems and lend themselves to simple straightforward reductionistic mathematical reasoning.<p>These systems however are only a subset of the much larger set of all natural systems.<p>This larger set includes living systems, chaotic systems with feedback loops, and systems like those in QM that exhibit what seems to be non-deterministic behavior.<p>Mathematics does have <i>some</i> content around chaotic systems. It&#x27;s possible to write equations for systems that exhibit chaotic and emergent behavior. Yet what you can&#x27;t do <i>easily</i> with math is write equations that correctly model real instances of these systems in the same way that you can for, say, billiard balls on a table or the motion of bodies in the solar system.<p>You can try, but what you end up with is a system of mathematical relationships whose complexity approaches that of the source data you are trying to describe. You do not get the kind of miraculous conceptual &quot;data compression&quot; you achieve with inorganic physics.<p>I am not arguing for some kind of supernatural underlying principle or that these things could never be described mathematically. I&#x27;m just saying that this should be a fertile area for new math. The language as it stands is not up to the challenge of describing stuff like the N^N^N^N^N^N^N^N^... causal interaction combinatorics of genetic regulatory networks or the behavior of real economies at scale.<p>I&#x27;m still very much a fan of Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s core thesis in A New Kind of Science. The book as a whole is a mixed bag and I understand why some had a negative reaction to it, but what he&#x27;s basically saying if you cut away some of the hype is that CS may offer new mathematical primitives that can describe some of these systems. IMHO the biggest problem with the book is the title-- it&#x27;s not a &quot;new kind of science,&quot; just a new domain of math. But Wolfram also oversells this emerging area of math a little... there is still a <i>ton</i> of work to be done here.

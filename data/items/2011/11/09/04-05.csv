3214311,comment,3213599,3213599,12,0,feral,,,"Lots of good, interesting ideas in that post.<p>A few comments:\nIn general, what data you capture, always depends on what you want to do with the data.  \nAny data model is an abstraction, which discards a lot of information.  This simplification is what makes the data model useful.<p>Of course, storing social relations as an undirected, graph with a single type of edge, as is done in Facebook, is a gross simplification of real social structure. Everyone knows that; Facebook know that; but the fact is that you can build a lot of useful stuff, with even such a simple model.  Is it perfect?  No - I'm sure we will do better in future - but you've got to admit its amazingly successful, for such a simple representation.<p>So, we aren't going to be able to define a format for the social graph that is so rich, that it will capture all possible uses with it - but I don't see why we couldn't define a format that captures enough detail to do many a great many of the things we might want to.<p>Next point: graphs are amazingly flexible data structures; if you have a multigraph or hypergraph representation, or a set of graphs, you can represent an awful lot of rich information.  Don't knock graphs too much.  You could build an awful lot of cool communication functionality, if you had really any rich social graph representation, not necessarily the 'perfect' one.<p>The author also writes: ""In other domains, a big graph would be good for recommendations, but friendship is not transitive. There's just no way to tell if you'll get along with someone in my social circle, no matter how many friends we have in common.""  Of course, friendship isn't strictly transitive; otherwise the giant connected component of a social graph, would be one big clique; but friendship is <i>highly</i> transitive.  That's why recommendation works so well in Facebook.  If A is friends with B, and A is friends with C, then there is a <i>vastly</i> higher chance that B is friends with C, than with some other random person.  Sociologists have called this 'triadic closure' and studied it for years: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure</a><p>So, while the recommendations won't be perfect, as things like friendship aren't perfectly transitive, they'll potentially be very good.  But what recommendation engine is perfect, anyway?<p>Finally, the author refers to the problem of finding an <i>adequate</i> model as 'AI-hard' - well, as I've said, any model - even the most perfect one (unless we go and make a copy of the entire state of the world) - is going to sacrifice something.  So I see why coming up with a perfect model is impossible. But as to coming up with a model that is <i>adequate</i> for a great many of the possible things we might want to build; well, I'd say 'AI-hard' is an exaggeration.",1320814601

Mine is anywhere between 8.5 and 9.25 hours. Too much more and I'm groggy for the rest of the day, and much less won't allow me to perform at my best for that day.<p>2. Try to sleep and wake at the same time every day. Sleeping in on the weekends may feel good that day, but then Monday comes and waking up at normal time again feels like hell. If you keep you schedule constant, your body will optimize its different sleep cycles for the time it expects to get.<p>3. Try becoming an early riser. Humans are diurnal (!nocturnal) animals. This means that if you continue to sleep after sunrise, your body will want to wake up so you won't get as deep of a sleep.<p>4. If you have a super hectic schedule that doesn't allow a constant sleep schedule, try polyphasic sleep.

Try chamomile tea to get to sleep quickly.<p>4. Artificial lighting sucks. Avoid it as much as possible. Open a window in the daytime and get to sleep earlier to avoid several hours of artificial light. You may save some $$$ on energy as a side effect.<p>5.

3214207,comment,3210671,3211287,6,0,mvzink,,,"You bring up Marxism, and it's interestingly relevant.<p>Happiness and liberty, for Marx, are about deliberately creating our material world. That is, every man is equally free to shape the conditions in which he lives (so far, presumably, as he is physically able). Capitalism, for Marx, undermines this by alienating the labourer from his product (the product is owned not by him, but by his employer) and through the continual growth of capital. To gloss over some important details to get to the point, this means: labourers are really and truly enslaved to their labour, which precludes the free use of that labour to shape their world, while the capitalists are enslaved to profit and so can only shape the world (or cause it to be shaped by their labourers) in so far as it grows their capital.<p>As a complementary result, Marx's ideal of communism has this desirable peculiarity about the relationship of labourer and labour: the product of labour becomes the true, free expression of the labourer's self.<p>I'd say Mr. Bukiewicz is doing his best, under the capitalist mode of production, to make his work an expression of himself: he even calls his knives art.<p>Read the about section of Made by Hand (<a href=""http://thisismadebyhand.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisismadebyhand.com/about/</a>) and you'll see that they aim precisely to expose instances of production where the relationship between producer and product, and consumer and product, is personal and socialjust like Marx always wanted.<p>(Attentive readers may note that the existence of purely creative work as a legitimate means of subsistence today, and the fact that Joel is able to make overpriced knives for a living, may seem to obviate this impetus for communism. I've heard it suggested that this change in society may be the very reason worldwide communism hasn't yet developed. Look elsewhere for that commentary, I haven't researched it yet.

446271,comment,446165,446165,0,0,lionhearted,,,"So, America clearly doesn't want to enter recession and let markets bottom out. The government appears to be solidly against this.<p>Now, you can fight off the short term effects of recession, and it's typically popular politically. But there's some real ramifications. Here's how it probably goes:<p>Causing inflation is extremely likely to weaken the dollar, which hits first and foremost the people making the lowest real wages. The people making the lowest real wages have little power to strike or collectively bargain that organized or semi-skilled labor has, little to no control over pricing like professionals have, and no places to invest money in real assets to shelter money from inflation. The poor get screwed the hardest in this whole inflationary gig, on the money supply of things.<p>When quality of life drops in America, especially for the most poor of people, then the government needs to decide to try to counteract that. They do this by increasing subsidies and welfare. If these programs are large enough to counteract the heavy inflation, they're quite expensive. Ironically, this further increases inflation, and leads to either (1) a weaker U.S. dollar, or (2) higher taxes, or (3) both.<p>In the case of a weaker dollar, you've now changed currency trading and interaction across the entire global economy. China and Japan are both looking at much stronger currencies vis-a-vis the dollar than in recent years, which sets off all sorts of unplanned chains of events.<p>As for taxes - most people dislike being taxed  simply by virtue of having less money and things. As far as I can tell, most people don't like paying taxes and instead prefer to keep their money. However, raising taxes while simultaneously intentionally raising inflation has a particularly interesting outcome: Money and capital flow out of your country really fast.<p>Why? Due to inflation, people don't want to carry your currency or bonds. The value of the currency/bonds is going to be worth less next year than today, so you need to move it to an asset that you expect to increase in value or hold its value - a commodity, equity, or real estate perhaps.<p>Now, due to higher taxes, people have less risk tolerance. This is because typically (unless you're a bank, or in good with Washington) government doesn't pay you if your business fails, and does tax you if you succeed. That means that people invest less. Which normally might mean people holding cash reserves while looking for a change, but during inflation - people need to put the money <i>somewhere</i>, or else it'd get inflated away and you'd have less at the end of the year.<p>End result? Because people will seek to invest their capital (due to inflation), but be less inclined to do it in the USA (due to taxes), you get less long term investment in American industry. That means less long term employment created, less machinery bought, less real estate developed. Money that would get invested in Nebraska gets invested in Chengdu, or Goa, or Sophia.<p>Now, I'm a global sort of guy, and I happen to quite like Chinese people, and Bulgarians seem quite cool to me, and I hear Goa's a great place. So it's not a net loss for the world. But it does seem like a curious policy for the U.S. government to pursue.<p>It's especially ugly for for the poorest people who have the least control over their wages. And in a brutal double-edged fashion, Chinese, Indian, and Bulgarian industries become more efficient and cheaper which further causes less demand for American-made goods. The result? Greater unemployment. Which further depresses wages.<p>Messing with the money supply right now might suit some special interests (maybe like a bank with lots of bad debt on their books, that's holding assets that have crashed from an artificial high, that needs to liquidate those assets in order to pay obligations while nearing insolvency... hmm...). But it doesn't seem to serve the poor, the middle class, or the wealthy Americans very well.",1232711297

Given the ability to block them means they would receive less downvotes and make articles that a lot of people dont want to read, more likely to go on the frontpage. combine that with the impression of new users (who havent blocked anything) and its a cycle.",1232711137

A couple of years back I probably would have just gone for it, but with this whole Global Economic Cooling thing, I'm not so sure.<p>What do you guys think are the prospects for a decent software engineer finding work in the U.S. at present?

Anything else :) ?<p>To elaborate: Yes, I've actually written an os, yes, bad hardware was my 'standard' in those days (a simple lack of money), imagine a pc built out of parts bolted to an old print-file trolley, more flakey than I care to remember.<p>A kernel panic in a microkernel presumes a memory or a cpu error, anything else the kernel simply does not deal with so that would lead to driver process issues, not kernel panics.<p>A faulty memory controller or cpu would lead to a kernel panic because of (apparent) datastructure inconsistencies.<p>One of the hardest drivers to write (even in a microkernel environment) was an X.25 board that a friend of mine had designed around some comm chip, for one the X.25 spec is pretty convoluted and there were a lot of layers of the protocol to be implemented in a single driver. That thing was an absolute nightmare to debug, other than that most drivers (harddisk controller, network cards, graphic boards) were a walk in the park compared to doing the same under a macro kernel.<p>Simply telnet in to the machine, start up the vga driver process and run it (under the debugger) until you manage to crash it. Most of the times a simple 'where' and close inspection of the source would be enough to solve the problem, recompile and run for the next iteration. No kernel panics.",1232709373

446254,comment,445389,445506,0,0,markessien,,,"The reason that this did not work is that it's really the height of stupidity to want to build anything like this in the middle of a unstable region. The same rules apply all over the world - when people are shooting and you are getting pushed out of your home, you really don't want to be testing out new stuff. You want to survive, get some food, educate your children and so on.<p>It's easy to sit in a comfortable home in the U.S and see this as something that would be great for the people in Darfur, but they don't care about this. They just want some stability in their life, and bringing in new materials and things does not work at such times. They want to work with known quantities.<p>I find it really sad that there is so much that talented people with energy to spend can do to help so much of the world, and they instead choose to expend their energy on the topics that are being hyped by the newspapers. Such a system would have worked excellently in Kenya or Congo or one of the dusty countries of middle asia, why even consider Darfur for this?<p>One should not see a charity as a fashion statement or a networking tool, one should spend money and time on things that actually matter and make a difference.

I&#x27;m somewhat inclined to agree.<p>I entirely agree; it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been trying to point out for a few years now.<p>Something people don&#x27;t recognize about, say, feminist theory on agency and objectification is that it&#x27;s a subject that applies everywhere. In this case, it&#x27;s the objectification of people in general as tools for businesses and governments, rather than as individuals with their own particular needs and desires with intrinsic worth. We&#x27;re uninterested in discussing what a student wants to learn and instead prefer discussing a paternalistic notion of what a student ought to be required to learn.<p>For some reason, we&#x27;ve lost the vocabulary for discussing things outside of an economic context. It&#x27;s probably because bringing up questions of morality is scary: between the polarizing force of political religion and the lack of education in forming one&#x27;s own moral and ethical system, moral claims find little traction unless they&#x27;re merely repeating something with wide support.",1389520799

I understand this might be just for beginners or people who want to get a simple view of the world but it&#x27;s totally not how it works.<p>The &quot;real world&quot; is actually much simpler. A &quot;coder&quot; is somebody who &quot;codes&quot;, a &quot;programmer&quot; is somebody who writes &quot;programs&quot; (is this different from coder? Maybe the way we perceive the word is, but deep down it really isn&#x27;t). A &quot;hacker&quot; is somebody who &quot;hacks&quot;, which can mostly mean who engages in playful cleverness[0], it needn&#x27;t be software or hardware, low or high level. A &quot;developer&quot; is somebody who &quot;develops&quot; software (this might be a step up from a programmer because a developer is usually the creator/architect of that software too, not just a code monkey). A Computer Scientist is somebody who studies Computer Science, which is a branch of math, usually (but not necessarily) with a degree.<p>Feel free to criticize me, this is my view of this world as opposed to the author&#x27;s view of his own world which I don&#x27;t agree with.<p>[0] <a href""http://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.htm"" rel""nofollo"">http://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html</a><p>ps: shall we add also sysadmins, IT techs, Software Engineers and Computer Engineers in the mix?",1389520422

They weren&#x27;t Germanic, unlike the Angles, Saxons and Jutes that moved to / invaded the land of the Britons, and even tribes like the Francs who moved into Gaul as the Western Roman Empire lost influence.<p>I think you&#x27;re right about the use of Viking being early, but some of the other elements differ from my understanding.<p>Two awesome sidebars from that period - another Germanic tribe, the Vandals, wrought havoc moving through what would become France and Spain. And a tribe of Scots were forced from their ancestral home ... in modern day Ireland. They replaced the earlier Picts in the land ultimately named after them.<p>[Edit: Corrected the Sacking of Rome date - I was out by 2 weeks.

7045635,comment,7045202,7045202,2,0,efuquen,,,"I&#x27;m always astonished by the backlash these topics gets in this community.  Are we all really so scared by the idea of trying to make coding more accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds?  Is there some irreparable harm being done to the community and the profession?  Even if you think this is another dotcom craze, which I would debate, it looks like we all survived that quite well if we&#x27;ve come back full circle.<p>I would ask you, how many of you have actually tried to teach kids how to code?  How many of you have the experience to back  up your assertion that it&#x27;s simply &quot;too hard&quot; and only a select few should have the privilege?  I would imagine a handful and I would be surprised to hear anyone who has had that experience tell me it&#x27;s been a negative one (if it was I would sincerely love to hear it and find out what issues you had).<p>For the past six months I&#x27;ve been teaching kids, at the high school level, with little to no background in programming and all of whom Engilsh isn&#x27;t even their first language (it&#x27;s an internationally diverse school), web development skills (js/html/css).  What I&#x27;ve found, which is pretty much what I expected, was a varying degree of proficiency, some kids have gotten it really quickly and some have needed a lot more help.  But overall I&#x27;ve been amazed at their progress and am totally convinced that this is something that needs to happen in more schools at a wider scale.<p>There are real problems in trying to tackle this problem.  I&#x27;ve met actual teachers that have been involved in trying to teach CS curriculum and there is definitely a lack of professional training among them.  What they could really use is the tech communities help and support, not their derision and dismissal, it&#x27;s so easy to view this from a cynical perspective instead of trying to actually get something done.  If any of you are actually interested in trying to teach and see for yourselves whether this is worthwhile and you live in the NYC area take a look at ScriptEd (<a href""http://scripted.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://scripted.org/</a>). Their focus is specifically in promoting CS in socioeconomic under-represented groups. This is where I volunteer but I know there are a few other organizations you can volunteer at as well, their names escape me at the moment but you can attend the CS NYC meetup to learn more (<a href""http://www.meetup.com/CSNYC-Education-Meetup"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.meetup.com/CSNYC-Education-Meetup/</a>).

Most are isolating, some are noise-cancelling).<p>Aside from the noise-canceling, the QC-15 feature I like best after 3 years of semi-daily use is that the cable disconnects smoothly from the headset when stressed, like when you suddenly stand up while forgetting to take off the &#x27;phones. I bought a spare cable, anticipating breakage, but I&#x27;ve never needed it.<p>These are personal, &quot;pro-sumer&quot; headphones, which are definitely not built to take years of daily recording studio rough-and-tumble step-on, sit-on, throw-around abuse. I&#x27;ve never sat on or stepped on my QC-15s, so I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d be affected.<p>These headphones offer pretty good battery life (I get 40 hours, because I don&#x27;t crank them loud) and soft circumaural earpads. But even with the light earpad pressure on my big head, I &quot;run hot&quot;, so the heat and sweat build-up sometimes bothers me. This is true of all &quot;sealing&quot; headphones. I got some relief with my earpad covers made of stretchy t-shirt fabric. Eyeglass wearers will feel pressure on the frames; I don&#x27;t know any way around it.<p>Sound quality is fine for me with good bass and clarity; the sound stage is so quiet it&#x27;s initially a bit spooky. They&#x27;re quiet enough and sensitive enough to reveal sonic source faults like my laptop&#x27;s hisses and crosstalk. I don&#x27;t know how durable they are against overload: I suspect fairly robust, because the speakers are driven by the 1.5V-powered internal amplifier, not the source (mixer, guitar amp, etc). But I also don&#x27;t know how protected they are against input signal level over their maximum rated 9 Vrms (<a href""http://www.bose.no/NO/no/Images/owners-guide_QuietComfort_15_headphones_AM323648_01_tcm93-36064.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.bose.no/NO/no/Images/owners-guide_QuietComfort_15...</a>).<p>The noise canceling is excellent for my most frequent uses (office, home & planes), and very good for my second-most-frequent uses (public transit, walking). QC-15s do not block people whistling and tiny dogs yapping; I really wish Bose would allow selectable algorithms or firmware updating; I&#x27;d pay $50 for that feature.<p>The earpieces rotate to fold flatter in one&#x27;s backpack, messenger bag or briefcase (I often roll up the cord and stow it in an earpiece compartment).<p>I&#x27;ve looked the competition to the QC-15s over the years, but I haven&#x27;t been moved to switch because the features and performance keeps me satisfied.

In practical terms, coercing a browser vendor into modifying their binaries to add an exploit is a comparatively risky and difficult way for the NSA to get a backdoor.  There are much less-risky ways for the NSA to get an exploit.  To wit:<p>1) All browser vendors keep a private catalog of security-critical bugs.  If the NSA cared to gain access to these, they could, with or without the cooperation of the vendor.<p>2) The NSA maintains its own catalog of zero-days in browsers, operating systems, Flash, Acrobat, and so on.  They actively exploit these bugs in  attacks targeted against individuals.  That these attacks are delivered only to their intended targets makes the bugs essentially impossible for browser developers to detect and fix, until they&#x27;re independently discovered.<p>3) NSA can add exploits to source.  Compared to coercing a vendor into adding an exploit into their binaries, this has the advantage of being easy to pull off without the vendor&#x27;s knowledge or cooperation.<p>In terms of Firefox specifically, the safeguards in place are not sufficient to prevent a determined adversary from committing a backdoor into the source.  Code review can&#x27;t catch all security-critical bugs, and anyway Mozilla committers regularly check in code which doesn&#x27;t match the reviewed code; it would be easy to slip in an exploit after review.<p>I suspect something similar applies to other browsers.  A browser&#x27;s being OSS only makes the NSA&#x27;s job of adding exploits marginally easier; there&#x27;s nothing stopping the NSA from planting engineers on the IE team, for example.<p>4) The NSA could use its targeted attack ability to deliver backdoored binaries to specific targets.  Even if Mozilla protects downloads with a pinned SSL cert, I have to believe that stealing or forging a cert is not out of the question for the NSA.<p>If I were the NSA, I&#x27;d need to observe that none of the above strategies was working before attempting the much more risky job of coercing a browser vendor into adding an exploit into the binaries they distribute.  And we know that at least (2) above /is/ working for the NSA.<p>In other words, if we&#x27;re serious about securing our browsers against this adversary, we need to think a lot bigger than just verifying that the binaries on our FTP servers match our source.",1389518093

In particular the various other engineering disciplines and the discipline of architecture.  In these fields you go to school to get a broad-based exposure to the various facets of the field, learn the critical mathematics and language used in the field, get some in-depth information about some slices of the field which particularly interest you, and do some simulation of ""real world"" design work which involves the creative aspects, teamwork, etc.<p>When you come out of these programs you're neither an ""Engineer"" nor are you an ""Architect"" and using those titles next to your name is actually <i>illegal</i>.  There is no expectation that the academic training produce a finished professional.<p>You then continue on another multi-year process of test-taking and working as an apprentice.  Of learning the actual <i>real world</i> facets of the field.  Facets which involve management, teamwork, business, people, design, how to deal with long, complex projects, scheduling, budgeting, etc.  In short all the boring details which separate the dilettante from the professional.<p>Finally after you complete your state-mandated term as an apprentice you take some tests, submit a portfolio of your work to the government and assuming you are actually good enough you get your stamp, can use your title, and basically be counted on to do a professional job.<p>This system while cumbersome actually has a proven track record of working and producing capable professionals.

504922,comment,504667,504904,0,0,newt0311,,,"As has already been mentioned, thats not a function, it is a func<i>tor</i>. It indicates a relation between two objects. Specifically, it tells the prolog runtime that a list appended to an empty list is just the list itself and that the resultant list and the first list argument should have the same prefix. Another thing to note is that the append function piggy-backs on the prolog version of list-appended cons-cells so that append function example is a bit deceiving. However, the power of prolog should not overlooked. For example, a call to append(X, Y, [1, 2, 3]) would have returned all possible values of X and Y which append to [1, 2, 3].

Overall, your thoughts are excellent, but I have a bit of a bone to pick here:<p><i>(I recall one coworker at a job, when we looked, had done 12 CVS checkins during a given period where the average was close to 100 and the next lowest was in the 30s, or something like that. Illustrative!)</i><p>Not a good example. Number of commits is an n-th level approximation to measuring productivity. As an example from my own life recently, I just finished doing a massive refactor on a rather integral part of my current employer's website.<p>Due to the bad shape this module was in, any change I made to it would result in a broken program until I had done a considerable amount more refactoring both within the module, and all the other places it was tightly coupled within the code. The philosophy of ""if it works, don't fuck with it"" didn't apply here, because it <i>didn't</i> work when it was thrown my way, and it was almost indecipherable as well. So I set to work refactoring, more to decipher the code than to fix the problem; it was impossible to keep enough of a logical model of it in my head to reason through the misbehavor. Every time I changed something, 3 other things would break, making building the mental model I needed even harder.<p>For a number of weeks, I had something non-functioning, and something that would be completely worthless if committed into repository (I was backing it up elsewhere at the time). The best these commits would've been is the SCM version of status reports of a system without cohesion, which would have been a complete waste of everyone's time.<p>To be clear, I am absolutely against monolithic refactorings about 99% of the time, and I did a tremendous amount of soul-searching through all of this. I worried that I was making this far more difficult than I needed to make it, that there were smaller changes than I was making that would allow everything to work out. But every time I'd try to find a easier way out, I'd hit a point where I found such tight coupling that changing one thing would <i>necessitate</i> 20 changes elsewhere, and things would cascade from there.<p>When I got to a point where it started functioning again, I committed all the changes in at that point. One commit, but a lot of lines of code, and even more deep thinking went into this work. At this point, I am now committing more frequently, as the remaining issues are worked out of the rewrite.<p>I guess the moral of the story here is: don't just focus on the number of commits, focus on what went <i>into</i> them. If these 12 commits were on par effort-wise with the 30 commits on average of everyone else, something is wrong; otherwise, the guy hitting 12 commits might just have deeper, more difficult work to do.",1236295232

Obviously cross browser testing is an annoying problem, and I'm wondering if there is a tool to help that.<p>There are tools like Selenium/Webdriver that push buttons, but I'm looking for something that parses a website's HTML/CSS/JS and warns you about problems. Sort of like ""you're using an X tag inside of a Y. That is known to look poor on IE6"". I guess you could call it lint for the web.<p>Does such a thing exist? If not, why? It sounds useful to me.",1236294116

All incompressible, true, but perhaps chosen for experimental convenience rather than any problem with their theory's handling of compressibility.",1236294079

They provide a much more immersive and meaningful experience than MySpace, and also provide incentive (points) for coming back.  On top of that, no registration is required to get started.<p>On the other hand, it's basically Yahoo Games repackaged for a younger, hipper audience... not exactly innovative.",1236294069

While this reduces capacity it also cuts down on seek time significantly, which would have a tremendous effect on hard drive performance in a database scenario. It appears they got >100% performance boost in database benchmarks with this technique.

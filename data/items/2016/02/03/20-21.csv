And it was launched by Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister<p>I work @infoxchange as the operations lead, when I first heard the idea of a website or app for people that have found or are worried about finding themselves homeless in Australia I really didn&#x27;t think it made sense - until I saw the stats showing that almost 80% of homeless people in Australia have regular access to a smart phone and data either via a cellular provider or free WiFi (Source: University of Sydney paper: <a href=""https://accan.org.au/files/Grants/homelessandconnected/Homeless_and_Connected_web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accan.org.au/files/Grants/homelessandconnected/Homel...</a>)<p>AskIzzy is the result of Infoxchange winning the Google Impact Challenge in 2015. For me the most interesting things about the site other than it&#x27;s value to those in need is that it didn’t cost tax payers a cent to develop or host and it has no model for making profit of any kind, this resulted in the site being designed truly for the end consumer - the person in need.<p>We did a lot of research, working with homeless and at-risk people throughout Australia and Service Providers, it&#x27;s really been quite an eye opener especially for my team who are largely technically focused. The research encompassed an approach called emotion centred design and was a collaboration between Infoxchange, Navy Design and Swinburne University Centre for Design Innovation.<p>We (Infoxchange) have had a large database of providers centred around services for disadvantaged and at risk people in Australia since the early 90s, it goes back so far that we used to offer this information up over BBS - and we actually ran the very first &#x27;online&#x27; search engine in Australasia, back then it was called &#x27;the info X change&#x27;.<p>On the technical side, it&#x27;s essentially a front end (open source) that accesses data from our services & providers database which is called &#x27;Infoxchange Service Seeker&#x27;, that platform is a number of Python app that use Elasticsearch backed by PostgreSQL with PostGIS, it has its own set of front ends for various purposes and has a pretty flexible API to query data, which is what is used by services like AskIzzy to get the information they need.\nIn the back end we host the various components of the platforms out of load balanced application containers (Docker) and rely on the usual open source tools of the trade such as Nginx, Puppet, RabbitMQ, GitLab (and Gitlab CI) etc...<p>Back in 2014 I gave a talk on the history and journey with search and our database of providers - those slides are still very much relevant and contain some screenshots from the mid 90s of someone accessing the data via Mosaic - check out: <a href=""https://smcleod.net/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget"" rel=""nofollow"">https://smcleod.net/search-a-journey-of-delivery-on-a-budget</a><p>With regards to updating data - I think that might be the hardest part, we all know garbage in == garbage out, so we tend not to like the idea of scraping, Many service providers do not have the technical skills or infrastructure to expose the the state of their services online but are more than happy to fill out a small status update form on a website, email an update to one of our systems etc... We also have a dedicated team of database updaters that make regular stop ins with service providers to ensure their details are correct.<p>The database content of services mostly already existed thanks to us running <a href=""https://infoxchange.serviceseeker.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">https://infoxchange.serviceseeker.com.au</a> for the last 20-25 years in its various forms, we spent a lot of time on the research, working with homeless and at risk people to understand what they actually need / want and how they would find it, a lot of UX design went into the project and a lot of time is still being spent on search result quality which is always hard.<p>For the initial funding, we put the idea to Google as part of their &#x27;impact challenge&#x27; which they give funding for good ideas that help develop technical services / projects for society and those in need.\nA number of other organisations around Australia have assisted us by providing media coverage, additional development and testing resources which we are very grateful for.\nOngoing we will be checking to see if it has made the difference we think it can by a research project measuring social impact over several years.<p>We are a not-for-profit, charitable organisation - we&#x27;re not making any money off AskIzzy and pride ourselves on our financial and technical transparency.<p>* Product video: <a href=""https://www.infoxchange.net.au/ask-izzy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.infoxchange.net.au/ask-izzy</a><p>* Launch video: <a href=""http://goo.gl/tRnGSD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/tRnGSD</a><p>* Code base: <a href=""https://github.com/ask-izzy/ask-izzy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ask-izzy/ask-izzy</a><p>Within the first few days of the launch we had:<p>- 7290 total unique visitors<p>- 172,266 requests have been served<p>- 8,119 sessions<p>- 6,759 unique users<p>- 123,885 page views<p>- 00:02:59 average session duration<p>- 82.4% new visitors / 17.6% returning visitors<p>- 0.7% bounce rate<p>*Edit: I should note that if you&#x27;re not in Australia and want to try out an Australian location search - try 3000 which is Melbourne&#x27;s CBD",1454532564

This is not news to diet and exercise enthusiasts, however, but it is always nice to see supporting evidence. Strength training, combined with a high-protein diet, is ideal for maintaining or increasing muscle mass even in caloric deficit. Compound exercises, like squats, deadlifts, benchpress, etc, involve greater whole-body muscle recruitment and are more effective than accessory exercises like bicep curls. It is likely, however, that the 3 pounds of muscle gained was attainable because of the relatively untrained status of the participants and their high body fat percentage (article mentions approximately 24% average body fat percentage for the participants). Leaner, more well-trained individuals, have a harder time packing on muscle when in caloric deficit.",1454531430

I&#x27;m personally a product designer first and a developer second. Sure, I can set up and deploy a simple backend, but I don&#x27;t enjoy it and I have no interest in learning the complexities of scaling it. Any time that I have to spend dealing with data persistence or managing a server is time spent outside of where my attention naturally rests.<p>Compare to a developer spending days tweaking the shadows and padding and colors and fonts of a UI component. It&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; to do, and it&#x27;s important enough that (given the choice) many people wouldn&#x27;t use an app which paid no attention to that level of detail, but it&#x27;s likely time spent away from what they really want to be working on and to which they can best contribute. So just drop in Bootstrap and maybe later get a visual designer to help swap it out.<p>That&#x27;s how I feel about backend services. Use a backend service until the app outgrows it, then---if that point is reached---it might be established enough to have someone focused on that problem swap the BaaS out for a custom backend. You have to be careful to keep your code sensibly decoupled and organized...but that&#x27;s a good practice anyway (and is also the defense against your very relevant worry about the service shutting down). In fact, the app I&#x27;m working on now is at a point where, after a year, we are replacing the firebase backend with our own solution.<p>Basically, BaaS&#x27;s can be a good crutch for some people---especially small, product design focused teams---because they remove complexity. Just like Bootstrap or Material UI can be a good crutch for small, data management focused teams. It removes complexity. Even if the complexity in each case doesn&#x27;t seem to be high, every little thing to worry about adds up, and it&#x27;s good to have the option of making tradeoffs.",1454531387

I can&#x27;t argue with that. We can&#x27;t all be architects; someone has to lay the bricks and you can spare yourself some trouble, and even find some satisfaction, by accepting that from time to time someone will tell you to lay the bricks the other way.

I don&#x27;t get satisfaction from producing a sufficient quantity of code, but from solving sufficiently challenging problems. Coding a means-to-an-end for me, just a medium to express my thoughts and ideas like pen and paper to an artist. When my job became more about bullet-point features and timelines than the problems the system was supposed to solve I struggled. A lot.

Our premise is that you can choose to use 4 different platforms for each one or move to a unified platform. Spark offers streaming, it offers Spark SQL and there are a bunch of machine learning libraries available on Spark. Also, everyone who has anything to do with data has a connector to Spark so it becomes a good data integration platform. The API is uniform across these. So it forms a good substrate for what we are trying to do. As for bugs, it is a platform that is growing rapidly , going through some growing pains, and over a period of time, it will mature. We believe that the core capabilities will become powerful over time (SparkSQL, Streaming etc.) It is a somewhat opinionated choice but one that we think will pan out over time.",1454530533

They have home theater systems, but all of them use tiny plastic cube speakers that trade sound quality for unobtrusiveness.  They have soundbars and waveboxes.  Bose 901&#x27;s are arguably their &quot;flagship&quot; audiophile product, but these are designed to bounce additional sound off your walls to make your room sound like a concert hall. The problem is that nobody masters recordings for speakers that intentionally add reverb. These gimmick speakers are designed to wow in the showroom with the right tracks, but do you really want everything you hear to sound like it&#x27;s in a concert hall?<p>Bose simply doesn&#x27;t target audiophiles.  They don&#x27;t make audiophile products.  However, they&#x27;ve carved out a niche for themselves that makes them billions every year.  That niche is basically one step removed from snake-oil.  Bose has somehow managed their image so that people think Bose really can cram audiophile-grade performance into precisely the kind of tiny, plastic boxes no other audio company can get halfway decent sound out of.  Bose fails as hard as anyone else at that, but somehow people believe they&#x27;ve succeeded and line up to buy their products.  Whatever Bose is doing for advertising, it&#x27;s elite.  This article is probably an example of what they&#x27;re doing.",1454530521

You call something that looks like:<p>experiment.run(new_code, old_code, mutables=[db])<p>Then the infrastructure runs new_code normally, but records the arguments and return value of every call to db (and any other object defined as mutable). Then, the infrastructure runs old_code, but whenever a method of db is called, it tries to match it with a call made by new_code and just directly returns the return value that call returned. If it can&#x27;t match the call, it signals an error, but it never actually tries to call db, thus negating the risk of side effects.<p>Obviously this would fail when the two versions perform different operations in the database, even semantically equivalent, but non-identical operations (say one retrieves a value and increments it inside a transaction, while the other uses a stored procedure in db to increment without fetching).

Asking yourself how good these each of signals really is and asking yourself how they could fail is probably much better than having a random internet commentator try to talk you into it.<p>But:<p>- last commit: I&#x27;m not surprised to see this here. Almost the entire industry is deeply invested in the idea that software can never be done, only abandoned, so deeply it&#x27;s almost invisible. And projects with enough surface area likely are like the proverbial shark: either moving or dead. But for modules with limited, well-defined functionality, reaching a steady state where the project is actually done and updates are rare should actually be a sign of quality.<p>- number of contributors: again, I suspect that where this coheres with quality, it&#x27;s probably correlated with size/surface area. Plenty of limited, well-defined projects probably are good with one or a handful of contributors.<p>- interfaces: are we talking about presentation of the project? Or the UX of an app? Either one could be a sign of overall craftsmanship, or it could be a sign that the author is concerned with appearances/marketing.<p>- code quality: tautologically true (code quality is related to project quality) but not helpful. One might easily mean &quot;do the authors of this module follow my favorite code style guide,&quot; in which case I think this is <i>extra</i> likely to lead you astray.<p>- unanswered issues: unanswered issues seem like a great signal. If they&#x27;re present (and real), the author(s) either can&#x27;t fix them, or the project is abandoned while actually needing improvement. Inversely, if there are <i>answered</i> issues, the project is being used and attended to.",1454529878

Then there&#x27;s Greek and Russian Orthodox Christians who exist but barely ever make the news. There&#x27;s also the Jewish Council but Jews in Germany are a minority (for obvious historical reasons) -- though they do get a significant amount of attention (again, for obvious historical reasons).<p>There is no Muslim church because there are too many different groups (and despite what some people will tell you about Europe, not enough of them in any one group or coalition of compatible groups).<p>There are various other sects of Christianity and other religions but most of them are tiny and not taken particularly seriously. Most Christians I&#x27;ve met think of groups like the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, LDS or Mennonites as eccentric but non-threatening cults. Then again, I haven&#x27;t yet anyone in Germany who considers Scientology a religion by any standard (which it seems to be recognized as in the US).<p>Germans as a whole tend to be opposed to electronic currency, though. Credit cards are practically useless in everyday life (except for hotels and expensive restaurants). Most places take debit cards instead but it&#x27;s generally a better idea to ask because many places only take cash.<p>Additionally €2 and €1 are coins not paper and most vending or ticket machines only take coins, so Germans are used to carrying around coins (and having a €1 coin handy because you need them for shopping carts). American style cards+clip wallets are basically unusable for most Germans.<p>However things seem to be changing thanks to e-commerce (Amazon and eBay pretty much started it) and most people are extremely uncomfortable carrying around large (i.e. €500 and up) sums of money in cash.<p>Besides, &quot;exporting&quot; large amounts of cash (€5000 and up, I think) out of the country without notifying the authorities in advance is illegal even across EU borders and Europe is considerably smaller than the US and has more national borders (obviously).<p>OTOH we don&#x27;t use checks.

Then I could set the screen up on a portable stand at approximately the right height and distance while the keyboard lived closer to me and lower down, perhaps even in my lap.<p>Right now the best I can do is to carry an external keyboard. But it's a pain to have to tote around redundant hardware. Of course, it's also a pain to <i>be in pain</i> after spending too much time using an un-ergonomic laptop.",1223768704

330012,comment,329763,329763,0,0,tdavis,,,"At least this article tries to point out that there's a significant difference between ""real"" piracy and ""who gives a damn"" piracy. One of the biggest problems still remaining today is the fact that all the power is with the recording companies, at least when it comes to music; it's not with the people who actually created the work.<p>Somehow, I doubt Prince would care that some baby is dancing to a grainy recording of one of his songs. Except for Metallica, I can't really think of an artist or band who would give a damn. These days many artists are releasing their work online for free or for... whatever you want to pay! The money is in live shows and the same people who go to live shows are generally the people who will pay for an album regardless of cost.<p>I buy a possibly excessive amount of music. I also still pirate music on rare occasions where a band or artist is new to me and I want to see if those two songs I heard on Pandora were a fluke or they really are that awesome before buying a whole album (or discography, if it comes to that).<p>What about TV? I pirate TV shows <i>constantly</i>. I pay for cable; I consider that good enough to justify not wasting 1/3 of my life watching commercials for shit I couldn't care less about; when I browse the Internet I don't have to wait for an ad to finish playing before reading whatever I went to the site for. If more TV shows were available for purchasable download, were priced less ridiculously (why should I pay $80 for the whole season 1 ep at a time when the DVD set is $40?), and were always WS HD, I would stop doing it. When I really like a show I buy it on DVD. Movies are essentially the same deal, except replace commercials with ""it costs money just to find out if it's worth watching in the first place.""<p>As far as I'm concerned, piracy is such a big thing now only because it's finally possible to pirate this stuff. Society hasn't changed significantly. There's no secret plot. People are just slowly realizing that they don't have to waste time and money just to find out if they find something entertaining or good enough to warrant their time and money. Sure, there are people who are going to pirate <i>everything</i> and <i>never</i> buy it, but those same people had shoe boxes full of tapes they recorded off the radio. Who cares? It's an insignificant minority. If the record and movie companies are failing it's because people have decided that their products aren't worthy of immediate purchase... then they download them and realize they're not worthy of purchase, period.",1223768641
330011,comment,329993,329993,0,0,sidsavara,,,"Very broadly I agree - but I don't think it's often ""me-too"" companies because people think ""Oh Digg is cool, let's make another Digg.""<p>Rather, I think people always look to RescueTime, or Digg, or Twitter and say to themselves ""Hey look, this part of it sucks. I can make this better and make it my own.""<p>In boom times, the competition (Digg/RescueTime/Twitter) is getting lots of funding and praise - so you in turn, marketed to investers as ""RescueTime meets X"" get funding because the market is already proven.<p>In bust times, there is culling of the herd, and if you haven't got something to show for yourself, and are very similar to another company - well, everyone prefers winners. So you get less funding, fold, or sold off.<p>There aren't 10 wannabe Techcrunches because they want to be like Techcrunch. There are 10 wannabes because they believe they have something different that's better.",1223768531

Rather, the nightmare comes from the burden of applying such a complex law as the DMCA with the frequency that would be necessary to enforce its provisions. It's the difference between doing your taxes once (or four times) per year vs. applying the DMCA every single time you turn the radio on.<p>I like my Fourth Amendment, too, thank-you-very-much.<p>Don't know why I felt compelled to point this all out.",1223768130

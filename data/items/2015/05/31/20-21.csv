People aren&#x27;t <i>playing</i> at them, any more than they&#x27;re <i>playing</i> a slot machine. They&#x27;re just hooked on them, with social reinforcement by the same mechanisms as prime-time television (the water-cooler &quot;did you get to see/do X last night&quot; sort of conversation.) They&#x27;re like viruses spreading through the population.<p>There are probably a few reasons why America has the problem especially badly—maybe an higher-than-average prevalence of ADHD makes this sort of addiction easier to fall into; maybe being the origin of these games and their first launch-market means we get saturated in them (and especially in their coordinated &quot;viral PR&quot; launch campaigns) in a way few other countries do. Really, I think it&#x27;s just that the social pressure factor is stronger—we <i>really</i> like having shared private experiences to talk about at water-coolers. See also: soap operas.",1433105922

9635488,comment,9635174,9635174,0,0,Aqwis,,,">Measuring narcissism was tricky, Hambrick said. Self-reporting was not exactly an option, so he chose a set of indirect measures: the prominence of each CEO’s picture in the company’s annual report; the size of the CEO’s paycheck compared with that of the next-highest-paid person in the company; the frequency with which the CEO’s name appeared in company press releases. Lastly, he looked at the CEO’s use of pronouns in press interviews, comparing the frequency of the first-person plural with that of the first-person singular. Then he rolled all the results into a single narcissism indicator.<p>It must be nice to be able to just make up and use a method for identifying &quot;narcissists&quot; without having to test whether the people you&#x27;re identifying as narcissists are, in fact, narcissists.

Depending on the country it will pay roughly 35% corporate income tax, so 1.2M left. That 1.2M can then be paid out as dividends @ (again, depending on the country) 10% to 25% dividend tax, so the individuals owning the stock will receive anywhere from 800K to 1.1M.<p>So on that level you&#x27;re paying anywhere from 45 to 55% tax.<p>If you&#x27;re earning a wage then the above does not apply (because for a company wages are a cost), so the company will pay your social security, corporate component, quite  a bit of which is your pension, social security and various healthcare components (depending on the location). You could see these as &#x27;taxes&#x27; but in fact they will benefit you in a very direct way.<p>Your income tax will be anywhere from 25% to 50% depending on your country of origin and your income level (assuming staggered scales).<p>After that the situation for both forms of income is roughly the same (we&#x27;re now on the expense side of things):<p>If you spend that money to buy a house VAT does not apply.<p>If you spend that money to buy food then VAT will be typically a low rate (4 to 10%, again, depending on the country).<p>If you use it to buy consumer goods, you&#x27;ll be paying 15% to 25% VAT depending on the location.<p>If you use it to buy energy or fuel you may end up paying no VAT to a terrible amount depending on your location.<p>VAT is typically <i>not</i> tax deductible in the EU, but to avoid double (or n-fold) VAT taxation companies can in fact reclaim their VAT.<p>VAT is an end-user tax and the purpose of it would be totally defeated if it were deductible for private individuals.<p>Note that in many countries VAT was instigated after WWII as a &#x27;rebuilding tax&#x27; that had a 15 year sunset clause, but (of course...) the money was too good and the tax remained (and climbed substantially in %age).",1433103081

The number of elementary particles times the number of Planck times between the big bang and the heat death of the universe puts an upper bound on the number of states that such a computer could enumerate.  The number turns out to be surprisingly small, about 2^500 or so.  Among other surprising consequences, this shows that, if you had the ultimate data compression algorithm, any state computable by this universe could be compressed down to ~500 bits.  Note, however, that if you could do that, you could compute Chaitin&#x27;s omega and solve the halting problem, so optimal compression is impossible.

1091574,comment,1091104,1091504,0,0,tptacek,,,"Losing a Unix password file in the 1990s would have been newsworthy. Password files were ""secured"" using Unix crypt(3), an algorithm that at least made a nod towards resisting brute force attacks --- so much so that when PHK wrote FreeBSD's md5 scheme, he iterated it PBKDF-style, because even then it was clear that using cryptographic hashes ""straight"" was a bad idea.<p>The biggest differences between Mindvox losing it's password file in 1995 and a webapp losing its user table in 2010 are:<p>* Web apps are getting fielded with straight SHA1 hashes, which is inferior even to FreeBSD's original MD5 hash scheme.<p>* Brute force attacks have gotten much faster.<p>The main advantage to bcrypt over, say, AES, is that the key setup is really slow. Mazieres spotted a weakness in Blowfish and turned it into a benefit.<p>Is there some real argument you have with me? I agree: if you lose your user table, you have real problems apart from losing password hashes --- though we could bicker about which of those problems is worse. Where are you disagreeing with me?",1264989266

If the password is of sufficient length and complexity (the keyspace is large enough), then bruteforcing becomes computationally infeasible. What the article proposes is, essentially, to use a more computationally expensive algorithm for the benefit of protecting shorter, weaker, passwords. I disagree, and think that increasing the computational cost of the algorithm itself should be used to enhance the security of passwords, rather than having their security depend entirely on that increased cost.<p>Good passwords stored as a salted hash, or preferably, as an HMAC, are in no way insecure. I feel that implying otherwise is a disservice.",1264989261

I couldn't help but to relate to some of the kids as I myself spend lots of time on the internet, but unlike most of them who seem to be passing the hours playing online games, I tend to do lots of reading and more educational type activities, or at least that's how I justify it.

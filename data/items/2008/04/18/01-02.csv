166869,comment,166481,166863,0,0,izaidi,,,"Yeah, the only really good era for written comedy was the 70s, when the National Lampoon had millions of readers. These days when comedy articles appear in the mainstream they're almost always in the fake news format, which is pretty rigid. Even the more creative outlets like McSweeney's have a fairly narrow style.<p>There are a bunch of decent college humor publications out there, though, and some of them have wide readership at their campuses. There might be a large enough base of people familiar with the form for it to get some mainstream traction again, if it's given the chance.",1208482582

166854,comment,166481,166481,0,0,izaidi,,,"Hey, great idea. As a former comedy writer I think it's really cool you decided to focus on written content instead of the usual YouTube stuff; comedy articles are an underappreciated form these days.<p>I agree with those who've said the design needs some work. I can see what you were going for, but I'm not sure you got there -- film noir is a tough look to pull off on the web. The monospaced font does feel like it's from another era, but to me it feels more like the early 90s than a 40s broadsheet. Personally I'd go with a regular serif font like Georgia, with a healthy amount of linespacing. For consistency's sake, I'd also keep the number of fonts you use to an absolute minimum -- the use of Tahoma on the right sidebar makes the ""Cast"" and ""Popular Articles"" sections look sort of like RSS widgets that don't fit in with the rest of the content. All that aside I do like the simplicity of the layout.<p>Yeah, I love the idea and I hope it takes off. Best of luck.",1208480935

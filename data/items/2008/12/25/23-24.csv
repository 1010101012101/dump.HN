409843,comment,409310,409831,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"We've been through several anti-religious periods in history, so I doubt we're anywhere near ""post-religious"". The arguments today are basically the same as two hundred years ago.<p>I'm with you that it is interesting and pleasurable to participate in historical traditions and ceremonies revolving around religion/philosophy -- as long as no coercion is involved. And it isn't.<p>Most of western thought came out of either Athens or Jerusalem (or a combination of the two). It's neat to see what parts of modern thought are still in various religious traditions and vice-versa.<p>Cool stuff.",1230249262

409839,comment,58025,58025,0,0,tarmik,,,"Unfortunately I have to agree with some ideas in this article. Long time ago I've had artificial intelligence forum, and kept it alive for two or three years, but decided to give up on it - because most of posts where exactly philofophing on theme ""AI"", not really useful. You cannot make a program based on those posts. Also one of comments here also suggests that ""Software is applied philosophy."" - I have to agree on that one as well. I've seen software source code, which were ""overabstract"", or over philosophical - if you could say so. Finally I've concluded that native language walks hand by hand with programming languages, and they should become one language eventually. Now I'm looking deeper into programming languages, especially C and C++, and how they are constructed, and trying to find resemblance to native language. Unfortunately trying to extract the essence/core of languages is non-trivial thing. I have hit basically the same wall as psilophy - operating on I-don't-know-what by using I-don't-know-which-terms using I-don't-know-which-logic. Also on some wiki page language definition page I have found a mention that languages in which you can express easily one thing, it's more difficult to express another thing. This basically means that exact atomic terms or definitions does not exist, and it's up to language to define them, and fluent communication is a result of language construction. So basically any language can be defined, using any terms, side effect is ""how easily language can be used"". Philosophy walks on shaky ground, since they try to define their own terms, concepts and logic, (or in other words their own language) after a while that newly defined language becomes completely detached from reality of this world. Or it might be even not completely detached, but not understandible by most of people, after that it still can be considered as detached.<p>I'm afraid of such detached situations, and so I'm trying to get highest possible abstraction of source code taking into account current programming environment / developers mental world. Each small abtraction step, which I'm achieving is one step forward - I can identify of what was done correctly and what was done wrong and take into consideration on making the next step. Unfortunately the further I go - more resistance I feel is hitting me back.<p>For example programming language compilers are made by whole teams, and architecture and design - even if they exists require enormous effort to develop similar compiler.<p>I however still think there is a way to simplify things, but it's very hard to find a better way / solution, as it is probably with philosophy. I'm inspired by language like Toki Pona, and that what drives me forward.",1230248517
409838,comment,409774,409774,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Are you in Germany or the U.S?  I don't know much about Germany's legal protections or the stability of their currency.  I'd imagine that given their past experience with hyperinflation, they're pretty careful.<p>In the U.S, I think cash is about the safest thing you can hold, in an FDIC insured account under the insured limit (currently $250k).  Don't believe any of the stuff you read on Reddit about hyperinflation; Redditors are largely idiots and don't know a damn about economics.<p>If hyperinflation <i>does</i> hit, you will have bigger problems than the security of your savings, notably how to get food and how to avoid being killed in a riot.  Your best bet here is the same as if there is no crisis: friends, skills, and a reputation for being a decent human being.<p>The depression-era advice of ""neither a borrower nor lender to be"" is also appropriate.  In a crisis, the fewer financial ties you have to other organizations, the fewer potential credit risks.  Pay off your credit cards, pay off your car loans, pay off your mortgage if you can, and avoid holding bonds or other debt on risky organizations.",1230248296

409835,comment,409774,409774,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I recommend this book:<p>William Bernstein, <i>The Four Pillars of Investing</i>.<p>(I also read Andrew Tobias' book, which is decent enough, although he's more of a light read.)<p>The super-short version: Index funds.<p>The Impatient Person's version: First, pay off all consumer debt (credit cards and car loans) and amass a pile of emergency cash equal to three to six months' living expenses. Anything extra after that goes: one third in a whole-market domestic stock index fund, from Vanguard or Fidelity if you're in the USA (an S&P500 fund is a bearable approximation), one third in an international stock index fund with low fees; one third in bonds. If you can figure out how to buy bonds denominated in another currency, that might be nice, but watch out for the fees.<p>Better, however, to just read the book, which discusses the principle of diversification and drills you on basic skills (distrust most financial industry pros; don't pretend that you or anybody else can reliably pick individual stocks; don't panic in every bear market because the darned things happen on a regular basis; etc.)<p>Don't put undue faith in gold. And don't feel that you have to go crazy buying consumer goods before the prices go up: At the moment, we're as likely to have a period of severe price deflation as anything else. Just look at what the sag in the economy has done to the price of gas, and everything connected to it.",1230248099

409831,comment,409310,409347,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Since we have this day off because it is a Christian high holy day, and since Christianity was the primary religion of our civilization for the last 1,700 years or so, I don't have any problems celebrating Christmas as an unbeliever. I even went to a Christmas service and listened to some solid carol performances and a nice little speech by a priest. It makes me feel connected with my history.<p>For somewhere around 1,500 years (since the Christians co-opted Christmas), people have been doing almost exactly the same thing on December 25th. That's kind of cool to think about and participate in.<p>On the down side, it makes me realize just how radical the coming post-religious world is. This is going to be a century that is more eventful than we would probably like.",1230247724
409830,comment,409696,409782,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There was a hypothesis in Steven Pinker's <i>The Language Instinct</i> that children's ability to learn languages is not an innate, magical part of being a child.  Rather, it's because learning languages is <i>hard</i>, and so people will avoid doing so whenever they have a choice.  Everyone learns a first language because otherwise they can't communicate.  People who have to speak one language at home and one at school (or a language with one parent and a different language with another parent) end up speaking two languages.  But the reason people don't learn languages late in life isn't that they can't: it's that they don't need to, and their attention can be better spent on other things.<p>My dad spoke and sang to me a little bit in Chinese when I was a toddler, but it never stuck.  I suspect this is because I could always revert to English and he'd talk back to me in English, so there was no reason for me to learn Chinese.  Some of my cousins - the ones whose parents were more strict about speaking Chinese at home - did end up picking it up.<p>Similarly, this also explains why immersion works, why immigrant ghettoes prevent language acquisition, and why people retain accents.  If you're dropped in a foreign culture and have to learn the language to survive, you'll manage it whether you're 10 or 60.  If you have other people who speak your language that you can depend on, there's much less reason to learn a foreign language.  And if you can speak well enough to be understand (as most people with accents can), there's no reason to improve that last 10% (which, in true 90-10 form, takes 90% of the effort) to make yourself sound like a native speaker.",1230247682

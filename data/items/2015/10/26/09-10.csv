Let&#x27;s look at some numbers:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV</a><p>Let&#x27;s take the Eurostar trains as an example:<p>> The Three Capitals sets are 394 m (1,293 ft) long and have 766 seats, weighing 752 tonnes.<p>Most of the other trains seem similar. The mass is about one tonne per passenger. So in terms of mass of metal you need to drag around per passenger, a <i>full</i> train is very similar to a small car (say, the latest model Mazda Miata which weighs 1056 kg) occupied by a single passenger.<p>But of course trains are very rarely entirely full (and cars average more than one passenger). But the whole mass of the train needs to make the journey regardless of whether there&#x27;s people onboard or not! The train I caught the other day was probably dragging around ten tons of metal for every passenger. This is what makes trains a horrendously energy-inefficient means of transport.<p>Aerodynamics? Self-driving cars could draft behind each other at high speed. Probably not a drag coefficient quite as low as the aerodynamically designed train, but it also has a colossally lower cross sectional area, because a train is ridiculously high and ridiculously wide (in the interests of not being ridiculously long, and also for historical reasons).<p>What else? Oh yes, the car doesn&#x27;t have to stop &#x27;til it reaches the destination, trains tend to have stops along the \nroute.<p>For speed, I don&#x27;t see any reason why, once self-driving is solved, you couldn&#x27;t have cars cruising at 200mph+ in self-organised &quot;trains&quot; on the existing I-5. No present car is really optimised for that kind of thing, so it&#x27;s difficult to say how hard it would be, you&#x27;d need different tyre compounds for a start.<p>As for comfort I&#x27;ll take the privacy of my own little bubble over travelling in the close company of four hundred random strangers.",1445852866

It seemed like a tricky, probabilistic timing thing (despite their many statements to the contrary!) until the eureka hit and you saw the deterministic way forward. Eureka moments like that are fantastic. It was an attack I had never read about or thought about, but which (despite being admittedly contrived) could plausibly exist in the wild. It required writing a real program (which none of the others did). And most importantly, it was awesome to see the numbers spin and lock into place, just like they do in the movies :)<p>Level 7 (which I really liked too!) was boring compared to that - either you knew about that specific hash attack or you didn't, and once you found out what it was meant to be, you just had to modify some stuff in a python repl to make it work.",1346943069

Didn't matter if it was a $10k month or a $1MM month or if the company was new or old--it was a constant battle. In one case it was only my personal credit rating (which happened to be spotless) that saved my business.<p>Yes, think about that. A merchant account -- where they hold your company's money -- relies on your personal credit score.<p>Anecdata: I had two chargebacks in five years of web software sales. Both claims were buyers ripping me off. I provided signed FedEx receipts for boxed software shipments and IP addresses/dates/times when the customer registered the software and downloaded updates. I ate the full cost (plus investigation and chargeback fees) both times.

Programmers don't know the parsing rules, And they vary by utility.  The end result is that it is very easy to make something work, and very hard to make it work correctly.<p>As was noted by fffggg, most of these problems disappear as soon as you switch to a language that lets you stick the filenames in strings and never again tries to parse them.  All of the major scripting languages will do.<p>But not all, just most.  The exception being the UTF-8 issue.  It does not solve printability of strings with unknown (and perhaps no valid) encoding.  Furthermore scripting languages often will want to try to interpret external bytes coming back from the filesystem as a string, and may have trouble if file names are not some recognized encoding.",1346942799

It was a large format, expensive custom grid paper designed for the kind of old fashioned production scheduling he used to do.<p>In general it was a grid, but the cells weren't square, they were wider so that there was more room to write, and along the top and left side were various specialty cells for tracking schedule numbers, days of production, reference numbers, various call-outs and along the left side room for specific machines and machine operators to be inserted. He used a fairly sophisticated color coding sytem to show linked jobs as they moved through the queue and hopped machines, so a red diagonally striped cell on one machine represented the same job later in the day on another machine also using a red diagonally striped cell. It basically allowed him to plan execution of production pipelines similar to thread execution on a modern day processor.<p>He had to hand draw the legend on every sheet and all of the setup.

Because the advantage of tree-based threads is that you can split off and have a relatively off-topic conversation without jacking the whole discussion. However, if such a discussion develops just below the top-voted comment, and it gets larger, it will dominate the whole discussion because people (naturally) won't always read the full page of the discussion.<p>This gets doubly problematic because of the tendency is that a ""large, slightly off-topic discussion near the top comment"" is <i>very</i> often about the same chewed-to-death topics that are just two camps firing off their default arguments at eachother (Apple vs general purpose computing, anything libertarian, intellectual property vs piracy, etc etc, you have seen them all).

But the whole point of these systems is to avoid collecting these communications, and to delete them as soon as they're discovered. It is, I think, fair to say that it's nearly impossible to devise a system that will collect what you want out of the first category while being absolutely certain not to intrude on the second. The revised FISA law was designed to ensure that there's judicial review of the process by which communications of the second category are identified and their intercepts destroyed. That judicial review has gone forward, as far as I know, and the program, with the current administration's blessing, continues to this day.<p>What's the injury to citizens and their rights?

4484172,comment,4483730,4483730,20,0,fffggg,,,"This rant misplaces its frustration. This is not a problem with unix filesystems, this is a problem with Bourne Shell scripts, and with UNIX argument parsing semantics.<p>Bourne shell is notorious for its problematic quoting, both of filesystem data and of any data from any other source. Every example in which he described a problem with a filename parameter could just as well be a problem with a non-filename parameter. The correct solution is to not program complicated scripts in Bourne Shell, and instead use a language which <i>does not implement variable access by interpolating strings and then re-tokenizing and re-evaluating them</i>. Examples of satisfactory languages include Perl, Python, Ruby.<p>Regarding UNIX arguments and the dash, it is an unfortunate aspect to the flag argc/argv/envp calling convention for unix programs. Some other operating systems provide more structure in their calling convention, explicitly separating different types of parameters from one another. This is both a strength and a weakness, as it results in a uniform yet inflexible systems interface. One of the greatest strengths of UNIX is that its calling convention is so flexible. The semantics used today are quite different from the semantics used 40 years ago -- yet execve() remains unchanged. I would encourage anyone interested to do a bit of historical digging here, and see how those more ridged system APIs fared over time.<p>Anyway, the solution to his initial question of using `ls` is the -- argument, which signifies argument parsing should be disabled for the remainder of argv: ls -- *<p>The correct answer to his dotfile/glob question is: ""glob() and the Bourne shell do not have the semantics you're after. Do not use them, use readdir().""<p>The correct answer to his find -print question is: Yes, print's use of whitespace was a mistake, and it is a mistake repeated continually throughout the land of shell scripting and accompanying standard UNIX utilities. As he notes, it is why print0 was introduced. Making print0 standard is far easier than reworking filesystem semantics (and, reworking userland in this manner is a more complete solution as it addresses data integrity issues from non-filesystem inputs as well). If you want reliable, correct programs, do not write them in shell.",1346940635

This commit changed two things: default file mode of open logs is no more sync in production (i.e. it is not automatically flushed by ruby write routines) AND it doesn't buffer log entries anymore (which is actually funny, since, you know, it is called ActiveSupport::BufferedLogger)
2. When IO#sync is false, which was the case, ruby didn't flush upon every write. That manifested itself in logfile entries not appearing immediately after write. 
2.1. In some 3.2 release they've reversed that, so sync = true is by default in all latest versions of rails.
3. Since logger doesn't buffer requests anymore, the problem of interleaving messages should still be there, sorry for confusion.
3.1. To solve this, you can either use tag features of recent rails or port older buffered logger itself.",1346940194

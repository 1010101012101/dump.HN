2287856,comment,2287575,2287575,0,0,alexchu,,,"I think the problem comes down to the kind of market and audience you're attracting. As a freelancer you really have to position yourself for the right market that corresponds to your rates. HN is a very designer/entrepreneur driven community. my guess is that people on HN would want to spend less money on design and more on development.<p>I would update your website itself also. To me your website doesn't speak the same level of sophistication as the piece you see in the portfolio. Your website represents your self and your identify as a designer. Dress it up a bit, this is your best chance to really showcase your design sense and originality. As many other people mentioned before, package your product well.<p>As a full time freelancer, you should spend at least 30-50% of your time marketing yourself and networking with potential clients. Building a solid customer database and having these customers refer you to perspective employees are most important if you want to have a consistent flow of work.<p>Are you really putting your work out there? Here's a quick checklist to get the ball rolling.<p>1. Do you regularly update your portfolio with new pieces?\n2. Do you have a profile on all the designer networks? (behance.net is a good one to start with). \n3. Do you keep in touch with your past clients and make sure they're happy with your work?\n4. Have you considered starting a blog that would attract potential customers with valuable information about graphic design and design theories that they could use for their own projects?<p>I think with the quality and level of work in your portfolio you certainly deserve to get that rate. I've worked with other designers who charge twice as much as you do, but then again, they all presented their web presence really well. When a customer tells you your rates are too expensive, it doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have the budget. It could mean that they don't perceive your value at the price you quoted. As long as you can convince your clients that you're worth every penny and MORE, you should have no problem getting the rates you want.",1299242670

2287850,comment,2287213,2287213,0,0,dualogy,,,"I swear by bodyweight-only resistance / circular strength training. Currently doing TacFit -- despite their ridiculous hard-sell marketing which is uselessly and pointlessly ""spec ops"" and warrior-themed (I won't link as I'm not affiliated other than a legit happy user). But there are more body-weight approaches than that one. Google circular strength training / CST and much cheaper than buying the TacFit videos would be getting a used paperback copy of ""You are your own gym"".<p>It's body-weight only, unlike gyms no machines, unlike crossfit no other weights.<p>BENEFIT: keep travelling without buying equipment you don't want to carry in your luggage. Don't maintain x gym memberships around the world.<p>It burns fat (don't really need that too much yet) faster and more efficiently in less time than hours doing aerobic running / swimming / cycling would. Aerobic exercises may be good for heart and lungs, but for calory burning they're laughable.<p>BENEFIT: muscle building and calory burning in one workout.<p>(Of course, if you wanna look like The Hulk you'll need to have weights at least kettlebell dumbell or indian clubs, daily protein counting and all the bodybuilding stuff. BUT you will look incredibly impressive with just bodyweight / Tacfit after only 20-30 days of good form, and it only gets better from there -- you even retain a good amount of the goodness after pausing from it up to 2 months afterwards, which a longer hospital attendance may force upon you).<p>No rep-counting, time-under-tension matters. This matches your bodily clockworks. Your muscles don't count reps either. Time under tension, whether you only get 2 reps under perfect form (important) or 20.<p>BENEFIT: no counting, just stopwatch.<p>There are no off-days, you cycle through 4 consecutive days (no intensity day 1: 20 mins, low intensity day 2: 20 mins, moderate intensity day 3: 40 mins, high intensity day 4: 40 mins) all the time. After 4x7 days, it is time to level up, adding sophistication, more challenging movements etc. to keep the body from adapting. TacFit in my view is a pretty unique mix of exercises and movements recombining elements of martial arts, yoga, classical bodyweight exercises and more, that help you on joint mobility, flexibility, core strength, muscle building, posterior improvement and both injury prevention and proofing -- all in a pre-defined package that will last you 9 months in a row without having to customize, modify or tweak the program. Afterwards, add weights, take 5 days off and start from scratch, mix or match, etc.<p>BENEFIT: minimum time investment gets you results in all areas that matter, including but not limited to mere appearance and looks.<p>Boy I sound like a marketer but this is really hacker-friendly, entrepreneur-friendly, productive-but-time-pressed-busy-person friendly. It revolves around so much research and experimentation done by the coaches who composed this after decades of experience. They're on Facebook, real people giving sensible advice to everyone and anyone dropping by asking questions. They get 70-80 year old people incredibly fit that couldn't survive neither a gym nor a crossfit session. (But rest assured their exercises are not granny material, they will kick your butt no matter your stage of physical development.) I'm seriously impressed with their stuff. You can browse my past comments here over the last 3 years, I'm not usually writing marketing copy for commercial digital goods around here <i>at all</i>. So this is really simply ""everything I need to know about fitness"" and I really do think it's the most hacker-suitable option out there.",1299242552

And because the Memcached protocol is public, heck, you could even have memcache-clients talking directly to your DB.<p>Not having loyalty to technologies or companies is pragmatic and kick-ass and makes you better in some ways - but it also gives you a wishy-washy attitude, and this outside-of-the-box thinking is actually inside-the-box from at least one perspective, as you'll end up jack of all trades, master of none.<p>And if you are going to master a piece of technology, which would you rather choose?<p>A proprietary piece of technology that's best in class for what it does, for which you don't have access to source code, and which might be discontinued after Microsoft invents this new / shiny and backwards incompatible alternative?

The reality of taxes is that the government decides how much money to confiscate from individuals who have earned it. Phrasing taxes not collected as a cost is just silly. You would laugh at a charity telling you you are costing them 10's of thousands of dollars a year because you don't donate x% of your income to them, but when it's the government, this line of thinking is seemingly OK. Because of the way the tax code is, there are always loopholes like vacation home deductions and such. The US decided long ago that it wanted to use the tax code to influence personal behavior as well as generate revenue. The result is a complex morass of goop that makes it difficult for the government to budget and results in unintended consequences. People will always look for ways to legally reduce their tax burden.",1299242142

Conformity is not the way. But, at the same time, I'm sad you feel those things are boring. Allow me to explain.<p>I used to be in your shoes, at least in the fitness aspect. I was a bit of a curmudgeon who'd figured life out at age 24 and decided that I'd be happy programming for, well, ever. That worked well until about age 27, when it started to wear thin. Deadlines, feature creep, a billion new technologies...who cares? It was losing its luster quickly. When I turned 28, I came down with carpal tunnel-like symptoms stemming from an overuse injury. I had to leave my job to give my body time to heal. I learned the hard way that I had to respect my body, and respect myself more.<p>The time I've put in on fitness has enhanced the rest of my life a disproportionate amount. I'm much smarter about what I eat, and I feel better, and I sleep so much better now. Because the sleep is higher quality, I don't need as much of it. I awaken ready to engage the day, rather than slinking through it. The secret of this is that the body was never meant to be disconnected from the mind. The two are engaged in an continual feedback loop whereby one is reinforcing the actions of the others with beliefs/chemicals. You just need to gently prod the two into better habits in order to feel better.<p>As for people, well, that's what life's all about.",1299242030

That seemed to work and we got into the setup process which forces you to pick wireless connectivity. In our case, the Xoom had extreme trouble finding one of the three networks set up at the office and was unresponsive for long periods of time. Finally after it did find the network we used the browser for 2 minutes and it froze and then that managed to freeze the recent-apps sidebar listing panel as well.<p>This all happened in the first 15 minutes of us pulling it out of the box.

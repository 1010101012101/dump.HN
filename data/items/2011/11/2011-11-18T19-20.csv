I simply didn't think it made sense to say that OSX had ""lost"" since it had very little market share at first and has grown a lot (I also disagree it's been holding steady at 5% for a long time), whereas Windows started out as a monopoly with nearly 100% and has declined somewhat since. That doesn't sound like any definition of ""lost"" I've ever heard.<p>If you want to include classic MacOS as well, I'd tend to agree more, but originally you just said OSX.",1321646292

I couldn't believe I was downvoteed for that.<p>Seriously, guys, if someone creates something that others enjoy and benefit from they can choose to keep it to themselves or distribute it. If they charge money for it they are entitled to do so and we should be lucky they've chosen to give it out at all rather than withhold it.<p>I really honestly, seriously would like someone who disagrees to explain why I'm wrong. Forget the idealism surrounding ""freedom"" because that's not at issue and I probably agree with you on that. I'm talking specifically about how taking anything that costs money and distributing it freely (like torrent sites) by circumventing the creator's chosen channel and depriving him/her of their chosen fee is at all okay?<p>I hate all this rhetoric about ""evil corporations"" and how <i>everything</i> should be free. It's okay to have that view and put it into practice yourself and with people who feel the same but why do we have to force that belief on everyone like its the One True Way? Live and let live. Some people put food on the table with the stuff they sell. Others give it freely. It's a choice. Maybe businesses do engage in price gouging and other unethical practices but that's not the issue. The issue is simply why do some feel it's okay to distribute paid content by means of piracy? In this context the definition of piracy is circumventing the chosen distribution channel in a way that deprives the original creator of the fee they would otherwise collect.<p>EDIT: As to the downvotes, I'm beginning to believe that many people are either not understanding the issues discussed in other people's comments as they are too busy thinking up arguments against them as they read. This goes for the original posts too. I'm seeing the comments stray far from the real point of the authors and I'm talking about first replies, not replies to replies or deeper. Let's reflect on what we read before going into automatic ""My views don't support this""/knee-jerk reaction mode where we shut out anything that doesn't fit our worldview. You don't have to change your mind, just make sure you at least listen to something different otherwise it's not a discussion but an echo chamber.",1321645955

It could be that the vacuum itself has an index of refraction for photons not quite equal to 1 due to some unknown interaction.<p>Neutrinos interact with almost nothing, so it's conceivable that they even if they have a small amount of mass and travel slower than geometrical ""c"", they could still end up going faster than photons because they slip through background interactions with ease.<p>Again, this is wild speculation, ""c"" is used all over the place, and if we had the wrong value for it, that would require a lot of coincidences, that this sort of vacuum index-of-refraction effect also had the side effect of making other measurements involving the speed of light (energy measurements, for instance - I would tend to think a discrepancy would be <i>way</i> more obvious here, involving, as they do, factors of c^2) come out looking correct, and that seems unlikely to me.<p>Then again, so much of what we directly measure is grounded in e/m interactions, so there's a chance (vanishingly small, as it is) that a fifth decimal place discrepancy in photon-in-vacuum-c vs. geometrical-c could escape notice because of the relative difficulty of directly measuring geometrical-c, especially if whatever vacuum effects that slow photon travel had other side effects that dunged up our energy measurements, too.",1321643458

These usually cost around $8000 and are done by the most unimaginably braindead accountants you can possibly imagine. Their job is to tell you a high price (say, 1/4 of Preferred) and your job, amusingly, is to explain to them why your company is Really On The Brink Of Absolute Annihilation so as to coax them into a 1/6 or so valuation, which then the Board will accept. This process is time and money you cannot afford, but the government mandates it.</i>  (source:  page 12 under ""Pricing"")<p>At the core of this issue was (and still is) how ""deferred compensation"" can be exploited by executives as golden parachutes.  When execs can spread out their compensation over time, the tax treatment of the compensation can be minimized for the execs and maximized for the companies.  Before 409a, the reverse was true.  Whenever corporate profits are earned they're either re-invested or distributed -- only two ways to handle the money.<p>Before 409a, golden-parachute-type arrangements taxed execs when amounts were actually (or ""constructively"") received as income.  This tax treatment made it favorable for employers to give deferred compensation as incentive -- lots of it.  Makes sense: amass huge liability for work that was never actually done on profits that have not yet been earned.  If you're an executive of General Motors, or on the board of any large company, this pre-Enron way was good for the manager getting deferred compensation, but bad for the company.  Any future profits go to the executives FIRST (whether or not those execs are even at the company still!), and the short-term performance of the company and manager is what they want to focus on.<p>There has always been a huge battle between corporate profits and executive compensation.   One of the best professors I had in grad school had done his doctoral on golden parachutes, and this is a pretty interesting area.  Complicated, but interesting.<p>Unfortunately, we don't have any laws creating incentives for corps to give profits to the common shareholders (in this case, employees receiving vanilla stock options), just the laws that encourage companies and their (current and former) executives to engage in tug-of-war over the distribution of future profits.

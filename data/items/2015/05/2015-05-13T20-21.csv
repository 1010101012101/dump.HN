The most common case is that when corners are cut, or &#x27;tactical&#x27; solutions are adopted, you begin paying for them within a week, often before you&#x27;ve even finished implementing them.  Another common case is that doing something in a way that allows future change is almost no extra effort compared to taking on the technical debt, but the vision or mental effort (or political will....) isn&#x27;t there to even try to see things in a new way.<p>So sure, sometimes we should embrace technical debt wholeheartedly, but most people are already too far in that direction already.  I&#x27;d rather read articles about people who spent a little extra time thinking in these situations and came up with a solution that was quicker to implement than the original plan, with less, simpler code and fewer bugs.  I think such things happen just as often as technical debt producing good outcomes.",1431550712

9541926,comment,9537900,9541792,0,0,Nadya,,,"Animals are far smarter than humans give them credit for [1]. That isn&#x27;t to say any species comes close to the broad scope of human intellect - but to say that there are not purposeful interactions of survival among other species would be wrong. That is why I said I did not know of one offhand, rather than say they do not exist. Although I could not name one on a level higher than bacteria, I knew it was likely to exist.<p>Symbiotic relationships are not quite the same - again with my definition arguably being arbitrary. I consider a symbiotic relationship to be when two animals <i>happen</i> to benefit from each other due to their actions and it is not one species using another.<p>That is the case for most symbiotic relationships I can think of. For example, pilot fish and sharks. Sharks happen to host bacteria that the pilot fish eat. Eating the bacteria is obviously beneficial for the pilot fish and <i>happens</i> to benefit the shark as well. It&#x27;s not that the pilot fish <i>specifically chose sharks</i> to eat bacteria from. This appears to be happenstance.<p>Some of the examples of ants and aphids seems to be happenstance. The ants defend an aphid from another creature that eats/destroys the aphids so that the ants can eat it. That&#x27;s fighting to protect their food source - something I consider &quot;necessary for survival&quot; and not &quot;beneficial for survival&quot;.<p>The case I cited where the ants will harvest the aphid eggs, store them safely for the winter, then bring them back to plants to hatch is along the lines of &quot;beneficial for survival&quot;. It&#x27;s an intentional use of aphids as a food source with what appears to be a methodology of breeding and sustaining their honeydew food source. It&#x27;s a &quot;step above&quot; a symbiotic relationship in my eyes.

9541908,comment,9541795,9541795,0,0,paulrpotts,,,"Well, it&#x27;s an interesting question!<p>I started learning C almost 30 years ago and while I have learned a lot of other languages: C++, Java, Scheme, Dylan, NewtonScript, Visual BASIC, some Haskell, a little Forth, various assembly languages... recently I received training in LabView.<p>I keep winding up using C again. I spent today writing C code that runs on an embedded board. Simple code, really, running on an embedded processor with very little RAM. There&#x27;s still a need for this. I have most of modern C++ available on this platform. It is technically C++, but I&#x27;m not using any classes or templates, so it looks for the most part very much like C99.<p>As someone who is well-acquainted with C&#x27;s weaknesses as well as strengths, I would honestly like it if I could migrate all my work to something else. I really like functional languages and I really like strict type safety. I am looking forward to using Haskell on embedded systems and think it will have a niche there. I&#x27;m looking forward to expressing embedded state machines in FRP (functional-reactive). However, these things are still relatively limited and experimental. As for Rust and Go, etc., it&#x27;s still a chicken-and-egg thing, I think. And I&#x27;m not sure they are really suited for _small_ chips -- what&#x27;s the minimal runtime? Can you get rid of all garbage collection at runtime? And remember that practical issues of tooling are _huge_. They tend to swamp theoretical elegance and even sometimes efficiency by a large margin.<p>So, I guess the answer is &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot; C still has a niche. At some point it may truly be unnecessary. As to whether it is worth studying or investing your time understanding, I would say the answer is almost certainly yes. The C runtime model is still the dominant one; C is still the language used to build most of the tools that other languages are built on. If you need to understand what is going on at the low level, just above assembly language, and programmers still do, they still need to understand C.",1431550495

It&#x27;s endlessly repeated online, with seemingly no evidence that it is true. (If someone reading this is aware of such a case, please reply with it! I would love to know.)<p>Also be aware that this was written when WEP was the state of the art in encrypting WiFi, and long before tools like Firesheep were widely available. You can&#x27;t expect Schneier to make security arguments that will be true forever. Today it is so easy to snoop on open WiFi traffic that any given 11 year old could do--and today WPA2 is sufficently good to stop that.<p>At the same time, Bruce can be really right about things too, like how to properly secure a laptop. If anyone could run open WiFi and still be secure, it&#x27;s a security expert. As opposed to my dad, who until recently was running Windows XP SP1 on his computer.

I find a lot of the death in video games very disturbing and not casual at all. I think all you have to do is look at the right things to see it.<p>With games being more complex and having higher budgets for things like special effects and voice acting, killing people isn&#x27;t just making some pixels disappear. Take for example using a corrosive gun against a human in Borderlands, or shooting a bad guy with a fire arrow in Tomb Raider (the most recent one): Killing enemies this way usually involve them dying slowly as they are corroded away or burned alive. There are voice actors who act out horrible agonizing death rattles for that (in both instances, there is an initial painful scream, a second of panicked realization, then horrible screaming for seconds afterwards). Animators had to make people writhe around in agony as they slowly die. Game designers made a conscious choice about how they would proceed with the deaths of people - these things have costs and I would imagine they aren&#x27;t small.<p>More obviously with Tomb Raider: there are some horribly gruesome death sequences for Lara if you mess up. I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of times I&#x27;ve seen her get impaled, or crushed, or shot and all of the deaths are horrible and disturbing. Every time, I&#x27;ve felt it, and thought about how horrible it must be to die that way. I don&#x27;t think I can really ask for more from a video game when it comes to expressing death, while still making a game enjoyable to play.",1431549618

When a home is built, it requires a footing, a foundation, framing, sheathing, electrical, plumbing, insulation, roofing, etc. However, homes are typically designed &quot;statically&quot; in that they don&#x27;t frequently change shape.<p>As a result of that, when it comes time to renovate the house, the workers doing the renovation frequently find that nothing about the construction of the original house was designed to make it easy to extend or add to the house. even things as simple as adding light fixtures can require running wires all through the house back to the electrical box, cutting holes in walls, patching walls, moving insulation, etc. When you go to add rooms, you find that the way the foundation was poured means you&#x27;ll need to remove existing foundation drainage systems to add new footings, add new foundation, add new drainage etc. Then, tear everything apart to add more electrical and plumbing. and finally, tear apart a big portion of the roof to merge the shingling on the roof.<p>Houses _are_ static, and thats why we tolerate building things this way. We can&#x27;t predict how they might change in the future, or what the needs might be.

(1) inefficient because you net lose man-hours or 
(2) efficient

The first one was in medical systems, where the suits figured we had a 6 month lead on our closest competitor, the other was in consumer electronics (navigation devices), in the time that competition was still stiff in that sector.<p>In both cases it was decided that releasing something was more important, knowing full well that we had to pay the cost later.

This has driven a huge demand for short rentals near the beach. I have no access to numbers but my personal anecdata is interesting for the number of people I know involved in grey-market short term rentals and the number of people unable to find available apartments, let alone available apartments anywhere near the rents 2-3 years ago pre-AirBnB.<p>I did protracted apartment searches in the same area of Santa Monica in November 2012 and 2014 and the difference in price and availability was immense. At the same time I had one friend who was making a full time job out of &quot;hosting&quot; for AirBnB-ed condos and apartments either bought or rented in the past year by deep-pocketed &quot;investors&quot; in Malibu and Santa Monica with the sole purpose of short term rentals. I know another young lady who rents three apartments and lives in whichever one is earning the least on AirBnb. She nets about $1000 a month doing this and manages to take 3 single residential units off the market in the process.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of people doing variations on this business model and it is absolutely pushing out the longer term residents. I&#x27;ve seen many of my beach friends (mostly involved in entertainment, good living wages but not anything like tech wages) progressively pushed further and further afield as random housing events (unit selling, massive renovation, roommate disputes) mean they cannot afford to relocate anywhere near the place that they are leaving. That is also despite their earnings increasing through normal career progression.<p>My parents came to visit last Christmas and they used AirBnB to rent a back house for a week a few blocks from my apartment.  It was great.  Do I think that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed? No, but considering their host was running a year-round business out of their home I don&#x27;t think it is unreasonable to treat them like a business.",1431547474

While it&#x27;s bad to let a single service grow too large, when you&#x27;re starting out, it can be helpful to write it all out, and _then_ see how it can be broken apart.

9541573,comment,9537641,9538735,0,0,emil0r,,,"Some further information regarding the allegations from someone inside RKK at the time and who was heavily involved in the practical running of the corp.<p>I was involved in RKK from late 2004 to 2007, the period when BoB became a true powerhouse in EVE and helped out with a lot of the more delicate stuff. The allegations I can remember were T2 BPOs, inside information regarding upcoming features which weren&#x27;t fully disclosed and placement of goodies (particularly plexes) in Delve.<p>So the inside information regarding upcoming features is true to a certain extent. Before the CSM they bounced some ideas off players in the corps they were playing with. This was not BoB only. Also, sometimes things slipped from their mouths when speculation ran amok on TeamSpeak. Again, I cannot imagine it being BoB alone. The directorship also tried very hard to limit this information, so when the T20 incident broke out many were surprised.<p>Now... onto the T2 BPO:s. At the time RKK was setting up its industry for replacing all the ships in the expensive wars. Before it had been up to members, but we wanted to build up a model where we were somewhere half in between the pure communism that existed in Evolution and the pure capitalism that existed in ATUK/DICE (iirc they were the capitalist corp). What we borrowed from T20 were 2 or 3 T2 small ammo BPO:s (all of them pretty much useless) and one Interceptor BPO which was the Malediction. As anyone who played at the time remember the Malediction was near the bottom of the Interceptors (Ares was worse I think?) and so wasn&#x27;t worth much. The corp allowed members to buy them for the ridiculously cheap price of 5 for 20 mill. That&#x27;s how little they were wanted on the market. And that&#x27;s it... nothing more was gotten. We did have a Deimos BPO, but that one we bought for a heavy price (range of 20B at the time I believe, and everyone in the corp pitched in to buy it) which had a terribly ROI and frankly... we should have bought that damn Vagabond BPO instead (money printer for 4-6 years maybe?).<p>Then the issue of Delve which turned out to be an incredibly good region. There were 3 reasons: Moon goo, plexes and easy to tank rats. But first... a bit of history. BoB, which at the time was not an alliance, but rather a loose collection of corporations, decided to attack FA (Fountain Alliance). We decided to do that through Delve which was a region FA claimed, but did not have a lot of presence there. At the time you had your three basic stations in the region (before you could build your own stations) and they were fairly awkardly placed. After having driven out FA we (RKK) started to scout the region, because at least 2 of the corporations in BoB wanted to set up place somewhere. At the time we were building up our industry to support our war efforts and had started to look into setting up an entire production chain, as well as selling stuff for that lovely ISK. We did an entire scout of all the moons (I was involved, and boy was it boring. DAMN YOU CCP), did an inventory of the minerals and what we found was that Delve was a fairly defensible place (1-SMEB was not yet connected to empire) and you could box yourself in at the bottom at one of the arms of Delve with a defendable station, there was a good distribution of all the minerals, the tunnel to the A2 system and the Y2 system would give us ample time to prepare for defence and we had an angry neighbour in the form of FIX which gave us fights and kept the rabble away. Pretty sweet deal. Then with the T2 production chain (moon goo... pure money printer) we discovered we had nearly all the important moons in Delve (and this distribution was given before T20 even had joined the corp). So... we settled down there, took out FA, had a ton of good fights with the germans in Cloud Ring (those tempest volleys were just wiped you out). Then we discovered that you could easily tank the 6/10 plexes by yourself and that they dropped incredibly valuable platings. This was eventually nerfed. Then they added 10/10 plexes for the blood raiders which gave even better loot (was needed, every pirate faction needed 10/10 plexes) and the Blood Raider stations (did not like those... and in the eventual war with GoonSwarm and all their friends they proved to be a crucial weak point). The important factor though is that Blood Raider space is very cramped compared to the other factions. It&#x27;s only 3 regions, which means that by its very nature resources are more compact which makes for good 0.0 living.<p>And that&#x27;s it... that&#x27;s the defence I can give and I hope it will put some doubts to rest for the people who were involved in that amazing and time sucking game which have caused I don&#x27;t know how many dubious real life legal activities just to gain insider information. I mean... that&#x27;s just crazy when you think about it. Espionage and cracking servers, just to gain an in game advantage :D.<p>Random trivia: dmZ and Haze from RKK wrote the original killboard. When other killboards sprang up some enterprising individuals though it a good idea to scrape the original killboard for killmails. Haze did not like that and so set up a pollution system for the scrapers giving out fake killmails. It ran for years pollution all the popular open killboards. He was very proud of this fact ^^.<p>Finally... for all the people out there who did play the game during this time. All we ever wanted was to give drama to the game, give you someone to hate and above all... we wanted you to attack us so we could have good fights. And take over 0.0 as well... you gotta have goals in life. Kudos to the ones who finally brought us down, even though you had to backstab us to do it. Which shows how macho we were ;).<p>All Hail BoB and SirMolle, the evil mastermind :D<p>Edit:

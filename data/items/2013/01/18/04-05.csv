We always knew there was oil in Bakken (never this much, though) but couldn't extract it until fracking came along.<p>The problem comes from a couple of things: First, many farmers rent land. It's the renters who are pissed. Second, those land owners that sold their rights years before fracking lost out quite a bit to what mineral rights are going for now that we can frack the oil out.",1358485192

Any long term relationship is going to require maintenance/effort.<p><pre><code>  you're changing yourself to suit her\n</code></pre>\nWorking out or wearing a suit or getting a good job or listening to a marriage counselor or acting more assertive are all examples of ""changing yourself to suit her/women"". Working out, for example, is the opposite of ""just being yourself"". Given that you will be doing this, the key is to spend time on actions that get results.<p>The key premise is that men are attracted to beautiful women just as women are attracted to high-status/confident/alpha men. The first half of that sentence is not controversial to articulate; the last half is where there's a conflict. According to society women should instead want men who are caring, sensitive listeners. Try that yourself and compare that to their response to an assertive leader who gives clear directions. That's all that ""alpha"" is; it really is an empirically large difference.",1358485001

If you have a well-normalized database, any decently complex query will involve a bunch of joins. If your sort is keyed on one or two fields in one table, why not sort and filter that table and join the result to the others? Admittedly I'm a bit of a DB novice, and perhaps you can speed the join up better by indexing, but it seems like to get 50 rows from two 1000 row tables, it makes more sense to filter 50 rows, then join, rather than the other way around.<p>If you're keeping the result server-side, how are you storing it between requests in a stateless context like a web app? If I ask for page 1, and you get all the pages, do you cache them server-side? That would add a ton of complexity.

When launching the first online notary service, the CA secretary of state published an erroneous notice that we had committed a crime.

5077180,comment,5075370,5075370,2,0,chj,,,"My thoughts on why C is effective:<p>Simple. An average C programmer can easily learn 90% of the language and use 80% on a daily basis. So C programmers can understand each other generally well. Although different projects usually have different styles, they are very minor differences.<p>Assembler friendly. You can link C code and assembler together with negligible overhead. Almost every performance demanding project has its busiest part written in assembler. Even though sometimes C is lack of a certain construct that you require, you can always implement it in assembler and connect it with C code (longjmp as a good example). Using assembler may seem to be contradictory to the first point, but remember only a handful of people need to work at such a low level, other people just use the C interfaces.<p>Reusable. C has a huge set of robust and portable libraries. Their authors are proven to be surprisingly disciplined.<p>However, we have to admit writing good C code is very hard. And I can see that less and less people will use it going forward. Steve Jobs' ""trucks and cars"" metaphor applies here too.",1358484588

When I noticed others were getting invited and after a long period, I didn't, I tried contacting them only to never hear back. I just applied again using a different email address. After another insanely long period, still nothing. Over the past couple years, I probably tried reaching out with questions a few times and signing up at least 4 times, never to see any invites come back. Oddly enough, someone I knew who signed up not that long ago received their invite almost a couple weeks after. Eventually I stumbled upon their blog post that mentioned something about the order in which you sign up does not impact when you would see an invite. Thats utter crap. Even if I forgive the fact that they took an eternity to invite people on, not responding to emails is a major red flag to me.<p>Finally, I did get an invite and decided to sign up. It was only after I was a member was I able to post a message in their internal system to receive a reply. However some glaring problems became apparent. For starters, I was surprise to find out that they don't have a way to transfer money out, only in (of which some banks will charge fees according to their site; I won't hold this point against them if true for some odd reason even though other online banks have manage to do so just fine). I did manage to fund the initial deposit without any fees but not being able to transfer money out short of running to an ATM is insane, particularly for an online bank.<p>Then there were the numerous posts about security issues that cropped up on here (HN) and other places. Overall, I have little faith in the bank that should have been disruptive but is slow, unresponsive, and quite frankly lacking. I apologize for being a dick and replying this way but people should ""play"" and experiment with this bank before taking it seriously and utilizing it as a real bank should shit happen.<p>They are very much still a startup, rough around the edges, and should be treated as such. To me, customer service is a huge selling point over anything else they or any bank offer and in this department, they've failed quite a bit until I became a member (of which I only have one data point, a single message, to go off of). To me, thats a telling sign. I've pretty much convinced myself not to use them anymore until things drastically change.",1358484255

I don't understand why this is the default. Most processes in the real world are not synchronous. Sending an asynchronous message makes more sense as a primitive (synchronous can just be modeled on top as a mini protocol, sender sends his own address). The other way is not as clear. (Spawn a separate concurrency primitive and send to the channel from there?).<p>The other thing that bothers me is the focus on channels rather than on processes. The two can be seen as equivalent but for some reason process-centric design seems more natural to me.<p>There is of course Scala with Akka but I don't see JVM a benefit, I see it as a nuisance (it is more of an irrational political thing probably come to think of it).",1358484215

I don't know whether you're referring to someone trying to shoot an assailant and missing, or simple failure to follow safe handling, but . . .<p>I think maybe an analogy will help.  From my perspective, it's as if someone said, ""I don't want strangers driving cars near schools, because I think there's a significant risk they'll run over children accidentally.""  From my perspective, I know how much control a driver has over a car, how well they pay attention, the rules pedestrians follow and how well drivers respect them . . . and I'm not really worried about it.  Every morning, I see bazillions of children walking to school, passed by bazillions of strangers driving cars <i>right next to them</i>, and I just don't give it a second thought.<p>The person I'm talking to does, though.  He seems to think  cars drive up on the sidewalk all on their own, all the time.<p>Sure, a malicious person could run over a child.  Sure, a crazy or drunk or just irresponsible person could get a hold of a car and do a lot of damage.  But those are both rare problems and not really specific to cars (or helped by laws).  A normal person, in a normal traffic situation, will spend their whole lives driving and absolutely never be danger of accidentally shooting a child.<p>I hate it when people say, ""Your opinion on a topic isn't valid if you haven't done X,"" but I'm going to say something really similar.  Not as a way to invalidate your opinion, but . . .  I really do think that folks who claim to have a serious opinion on gun issues should at <i>least</i> spend an afternoon at a range once.  Spend $50, take a class, rent a gun, and work through a box of ammo.  It's fun, and you'll learn what guns are, how they're safely handled, how dangerous they are (and aren't) when handled responsibly, and . . . well, for lack of a better way to say it, learn how much control even first-time shooters have over them.<p>I know that comes off as a snarky, ""I know more than you"" post, and it's not intended that way, really.  It's just that I really do think a lot of the fear of guns is fear of the unknown.  I honestly wish a firearms safety course was routine, like driver's ed, and then maybe we'd all at least understand the object we're talking about.",1358483609

5077076,comment,5075370,5076467,6,0,betterunix,,,"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof and the onus is on Lisp advocates to explain why there are so few real-world Lisp success stories. Calling everybody else stupid isn't good enough.""<p>You seem to be suggesting that some technical shortcoming of Lisp held it back in the real world, while C and C++ had technical advantages that led to their success.  I think the history of Lisp and the history of C tell a much different story.<p>While C was becoming <i>the</i> language of choice for OSes that ran on low-end computers (especially Unix), Lisp was confined to very expensive computers that were being targeted at a market that ultimately failed to materialize.  C became popular by riding on the coattails of Unix, not because it is a great language or because it could compete with other languages on technical features, and C++ road on the coattails of C (maintaining some amount of compatibility etc.).  Lisp, meanwhile, was held back by bad business decisions; no amount of technical superiority could have saved Lisp from the AI winter.  By the time you could really talk about Lisp running on PCs or cheap hardware, it was too late:  C was already widely used and there was already an enormous volume of C code that people were working with.<p>It is interesting that you mention ITA's use of C++.  The big reason for that was the poor scalability of CMUCL's garbage collector, which they did not use at all, opting instead for memory-mapped arrays (hence C++, which was used to handle system calls and deal with pointers).  Had ITA been developing for an OS written in Lisp (not unprecedented), C++ would never have entered the picture; but ITA was developing for an OS that exposed a C API and a C ABI, and using C or C++ to deal with system calls simply made the most sense.  I suspect that if they were to try again today, they would use far less C++, if any; today's Lisp compilers come with (non-portable) extensions for POSIX system calls and for dealing with pointers, as well as disabling the garbage collector globally or on specific objects.  It is not that Lisp itself was slow; just a specific feature of the Lisp systems they were using, and poor support for disabling or avoiding the use of that feature.<p>So which is more likely:  that C and C++ are the <i>best</i> languages ever developed for the kinds of programs they are used for, or that they were just in the right place at the right time?",1358482826

I've personally been hearing about how amazing it is, how everyone writing Lisp will be incredibly productive for at least 15 years  during which absolutely nothing of significance written in Lisp has shipped even while some ideas developed or popularized in Lisp have spread to many popular languages.<p>Almost every single time this has come up, someone has cited drawbacks: lack of a standard high-quality implementation, limited libraries and, somewhat less universally, highly idiosyncratic coding styles hurting interoperability.<p>This generally gets a mix of dismissal or vague promises that it'll get better real soon now. Meanwhile, the only claim Lisp has on mainstream status in 2013 runs on the JVM so it has credible tools, performance and libraries. I would argue that this is neither coincidental nor caused by lack of unidirectional advocacy.",1358481605

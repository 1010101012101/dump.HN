118317,comment,117123,118306,0,0,anaphoric,,,"OK, you are right, that wasn't so bad. Perhaps I will take a closer look at SPARQL one of these days.<p>BTW how does it do with things like spatial constrains.
In relational databases it's easy to express spatial joins over relations. For example given<p>Structure(id, name, x, y, type)<p>you can query for things like all the structures of type 'pharmacy' within 1 km of a 'hospital'. It's simple to define functions like distance(x1,y1,x2,y2) that may be predicated on. Anything like that in SPARQL (yet)?",1203364570

I particularly enjoyed the somewhat applicable reference to Star Trek, humpback whales and plexiglass.<p>""Contrary to the popular image, their work has revealed even a quantum computer would face significant limitations.  In particular, while a quantum computer could quickly factor 
large numbers, and thereby break most of the cryptographic codes used on the Internet today, there’s reason to think that not even a quantum computer could solve the crucial 
class of NP-complete problems efficiently.  This class includes the problems mentioned above.  Limitations of quantum computers have also been found for games of strategy 
like chess, as well as for breaking cryptographic hash functions.  All of these limitations apply to a class of algorithms known as “black-box algorithms,” which encompasses all quantum algorithms known today.  Giving a complete proof that no fast quantum algorithm can solve these problems is out of the question, since we can’t even prove that no fast quantum algorithm can solve them.

The challenge is that there's no scarcity on the internet, so you have to create artificial scarcity. It may be that the best way to fix the problem (i.e. to create scarcity) is through fees. For example, a $1.00 (rising with demand) fee per submission would keep a lot of junk out of any discussion site. And any serious content producer or blogger wouldn't blink at the notion of a small fee. The assumption that everything should be free is what kills many of these sites.",1203363911

118299,comment,118129,118129,0,0,hobbs,,,"One thing that I hadn't fully realized until I was about 30 or so: Your grades and test scores only matter to ""the first"". That is, your high-school grades and SAT scores only matter to the first college that you enroll in. After about a year or two in college, if you transfer to a different college, they don't care a whit what your high-school grades were. They want to know what your college grades are.<p>Similarly, your college grades and the name of the college only matters to your first employer. After that, future employers don't care what your college GPA was. They want to know what you've accomplished professionally.<p>This is not to say you can just slack your way through school. What it does mean, though, is that you shouldn't obsess about your GPA. Channel that academic energy into some actual achievements - not into ultimately meaningless points. In the end, accomplishments are worth much more than grades.",1203362500

118294,comment,118106,118179,0,0,gcv,,,"I think TextMate's Rails mode came before emacs-rails and inspired it. That's probably part of the reason. Another part is that TextMate behaves much more like a Mac app, and Rails was started by Mac users. So it's partly history, partly momentum.<p>I also tried TextMate, and do still use it for some things (I like the personal text wiki extension, which I hacked a bit to use MediaWiki syntax), but found myself programming back in Emacs in short order. TextMate's extension mechanism is incredibly obtuse compared to elisp (the Lisp-intolerant claim this is a strength, but just try making sense of how to customize a non-trivial TextMate mode and see how far you get). Running external scripts just to do basic things seems pretty inefficient to me. Also, its UI needs lots and lots of work. The inability to simultaneously look at two buffers in one project is a deal killer for me. I'm sure it'll improve in the next version.<p>Back on topic: native Unicode in Emacs 23 sounds great.

I'm just doing the same thing as I did before, only without so much goofing off (reading email, drinking, eating, etc) I separate that from ""hacking"" which I picture as taking a machete and flailing away at the code until it submits, no matter what state it is in. I have been known to hack with the best of 'em, but only for short periods, usually the last few hours around a drop.<p>But usually I'm always thinking of the structure of the code as I code, continuing the work I did with modeling (if I did any) as I think through what is important, what goes where, what are the important nouns and verbs of my intermediate language. I drop back out of design mode to pick up various pieces of functionality, then continue the work. I'm usually looking for the biggest headache first -- might as well suffer now rather than later. Usually the biggest headaches are the ones that have greatest impact on whether your strategies are correct or not -- whether caching that huge list is going to work real-time or whether a distributed linked-list is going to work. But then I always end up spending the same amount of time on such vexing stuff as ""How did I get that box blue, anyway?"" or ""why is that off by one pixel?"" or something like that.

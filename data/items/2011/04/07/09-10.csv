They don't provide methods so:<p><pre><code>  int i = 4;\n  i.toString(); //Exception - int isn't a class, so i isn't an object, so you can't call its methods.\n\n  Integer j = 4;\n  j.toString(); //Returns ""4"" as a string, because Integer is a class.\n</code></pre>\nJava would 'encourage' the latter practice at times because its useful to be able to call methods off of characters and integers and such, but there is a difference.",1302170378

That would reduce their load down to sending the paperdoll parts, which will be about as tiny as any textured 3D model. With some work to space out the compositing process over multiple frames, the CPU burden during caching would be negligible.<p>Edit: Read it again, looks like they actually were caching on the client before.

The question is ""What is gravity?""<p>An accepted answer, what I was taught in school, and what I would answer if you asked me is ""it's a force"". And labeling something as ""a force"" has huge implications for people that know what that label means.<p>If a four year old asked me ""What is gravity?"", I'd know better than to give him a label, because he wouldn't know what a force is from school. Obviously.<p>If it turns out gravity is not really a force -- if modelling gravity as a force breaks down at some point -- that's a good fundamental result. It is a falsification of the theory ""Gravity is a force"". (So the line of thought goes: ""What is gravity?"", ""It is a force!"", ""Is gravity really a force?"", ""Perhaps not!"")<p>How is this not helping us attaining a deep understanding?

If this were to come before a court, the judge would try to balance the two rights (right to privacy and the right to be safe from child molesters or what not) to determine which of them should prevail in this situation. An important consideration is the fact that the aim of the government can mostly be achieved in a more practical way in this case (i.e. allowing them access to the data, without giving them a password), so I think that this law stands a good chance to be shot down.<p>A good example of a case involving privacy and the margin of appreciation of a national lawmaker is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_and_Marper_v_United_Kingdom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_and_Marper_v_United_Kingdom</a><p>P.S.

Each compilation unit introduces own, anonymous (cannot be addressed/indicated directly) namespace. Symbols defined `static' (``having static linkage'', actually) reside only in it, and are not visible outside of that namespace. Symbols with external linkage are the API of the namespace. It may sound strange, but it's perfectly OK to have symbols with same name in several namespaces, as long as they are static (residing only in it); no conflict because they are not addressible from outside. In a way, a C's compilation unit is similar to C++'s class -- static (C) / private (C++) elements are visible only from this compilation unit (C) / class (C++).<p>So yes, you can easily split any C application into well defined components with small APIs, without risk of collision between names of private symbols. You only need to ensure unique naming among the `public' API symbols.<p>Linker use and linkage is a lost art those days, eh ;-(",1302167499

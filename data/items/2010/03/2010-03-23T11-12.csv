I get through a lot fewer classic books than many of my obsessive-reader friends because I take time to revisit books over and over. And it occurs to me that this, too, is a key activity in writing: One must read sentences and paragraphs again and again to refine them.",1269345164

1212684,comment,1211328,1211622,0,0,bmelton,,,"It IS that easy, the trouble is finding the niches that are profitable that other people haven't already found.  Getting in late to the game limits your choices to either 1) Being MUCH better at SEO than the more established people working the same strategy, 2) Finding a new niche that has somehow been overlooked by all the other people doing the same thing you are or 3) Finding less profitable niches in which to fill the need and game.<p>The reason that everybody isn't doing it is many-part, but the highlights are that SEO isn't that easy for the lay-person, and it actually does take quite a bit of work and commitment.  There is a very big initial workload to setting up a site to generate passive income, and like a fire, it needs constant stoking to maintain, and will start by making VERY small amounts of money at a time (My first attempt grossed an average of $12 per month).<p>Simply put, the 'easiest' way to make money isn't really all that easy... and as for 'lowest risk', I'd completely dispute that too.  If Google changes an algorhythm, or categorizes you as spam, or you're linked to by an unsavory site, then that could all go away.  If you're hosting 50 sites on the same IP address, and have actually managed to get them to profitability, and Google bans the IP, now what?",1269345016

I know enough C to be able to read and  patch small apps where I find bugs, but I'd like to sit down and properly learn the language, in a way that encourages neat, usable code for my colleagues, that meets whatever the current standards are for C and covers modern topics like threading. I'm planning on using this to develop Python modules or hack on small Unix tools.<p>I've previously read K and R and found it understandable but a little boring. I really like the Head First series (but alas they have no C book) or anything with lots of examples.<p>What's the best introduction to C book you'd recommend?<p>Edit: Thankyou to everyone who's responded.",1269344398

This is very different from shell builtins that do not launch a new executable, and will thus function correctly after the executable is remove from the file system.  As far as I know, you cannot get busybox to perform it's other functions as ""builtins"".  But if you have a functional debugger, it should be possible, though computing offsets is likely to be hard without another machine (chances are that the busybox binary has been stripped).",1269343919

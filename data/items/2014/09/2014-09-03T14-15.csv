Regardless of the reputation of a brand, people have different tastes when it comes to cars.

8263263,comment,8261098,8261098,89,0,tsunamifury,,,"I built language learning applications that reached over 10 million users in the developing world and my brother built a startup that employs only ex-cons in one of the worst neighborhoods in America.<p>We learned a few things from actually doing this:<p>TL;DR its really expensive to make products for the &#x27;forgotten underclass&#x27; due to many unforeseen issues.<p>1) Poor areas are overrun with corruption and graft.  Its very hard to do the right thing, when individuals with power will actively work to put a bribe barrier between you and your work.  Its like these individuals smell out good intentions and attempt to tax them for the perceived weak-minded good intentions.  An example would be, after my brother created several successful startups using ex-cons, he wanted to turn the program over to the City.  He quickly learned without a politician attached and &#x27;sitting on the board&#x27; you couldn&#x27;t do this.  The price of this? Paying him 70% of the donations coming in to support the program.  I have numerous examples more blatant in 2nd and 3rd world nations.<p>2) Economy of Scale.  You must serve more customers in order to make up for lower prices the market will bare.  This is easy to say and very very hard to do. As you scale, you can&#x27;t afford more workers, so your quality inevitably goes down.  Other things like support, QA and tasks that don&#x27;t scale past 1:10 user rations become very poor quality, turning off people to the product and making you ashamed of your work.<p>3) Not knowing what the problem is.  You can guess at problems for a class of people you aren&#x27;t a part of, but its pretty hard to design a new solution for them.  Your instincts are often wrong and you have to do a lot of expensive testing and research you can&#x27;t afford to get the right solution.  See problem 2.<p>4) Distribution to customers. Want to get the product to this underclass?  Do they have smartphones? Do they have computers? Often no. How are you going to ensure they see your product let alone purchase it? Maybe they do have smartphones, but they use everything from dumb-phones to android 2.3 devices to Nokia-whatevers.  Development for all those things will cost you 5x as much as just making a food iPhone app. (see 2 again)<p>5) Value offer.  This becomes very very hard when your target market is low on funds and often makes anti-self-interest choices.  The individual who uses what little money they have to feed their family with fast food is going to pay money for your education app?  Its pretty unlikely, they have more pressing needs in their hierarchy that they are often too scared and desperate to solve properly.<p>6) Their problems can&#x27;t be solved with software.  Often these people have real-world problems that require hands on work and real product to solve.  My brother worked very hard to add software where possible but needed to do mostly &#x27;real world&#x27; labor to get to his customers.  Software is inherently cheap to produce compared to hardware and manual labor.<p>Finally, this work will eat you away until you have very little left.  Your rent will go up as your friends sell their startups. You won&#x27;t have time or money to rebalance your life with exercise or entertainment. You will becomes socially isolated from those who have the money to support your work.  You will put immense pressure on your significant other to either make up your losses financially or support you. You will put your children&#x27;s future in jeopard. You won&#x27;t have children. You will see little return on your effort. You will  be fighting a society which applauds your effort but is unwilling to help you continue.<p>In short, you might become part of the class you are trying to help.",1409756078

It such cases questioning the authority you just invoked is very natural and good thing for the discussion. If you want discussion about specific arguments, give the arguments (which original poster hasn&#x27;t provided). You can&#x27;t expect to just claim something basing it on authority and having other side investigate every point in reasoning that authority gives (and even have them explore and find points themselves) as it puts discussion in imbalance: you do nothing, but invoke authority, the other side is expected to dig deep into every point that authority makes. On the other hand if it&#x27;s shown that the authority is very biased then either you show specific arguments (which the other side is not allowed to dismiss on bias of the source) or you admit defeat.<p>That&#x27;s the way to deal with arguments from authority but some posters were very charitable anyway and gave more analysis than original claim deserved.<p>Ad-hominem refers to dismissing specific points/arguments based on who made them.

If anything, we are unnecessarily generous with the food stamps here. (Which I am not necessarily complaining about, just observing that they are relatively easy to get.) And lo, it turns out this was in Britain, so saying they can&#x27;t afford $44 is sort of deceptive. I well believe she couldn&#x27;t afford £44.<p>There&#x27;s a certain segment in American politics who really doesn&#x27;t like to talk about this, but for all the drama, the poor in America are still better off than they are in almost any other country, which, yes, includes all (AFAIK) the European countries, and while that doesn&#x27;t prove anything about what we do or do not need to do in that area, it does suggest that rhetoric about poverty in the US can occasionally get overblown. (It&#x27;s a political thing where, let&#x27;s be honest, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of incentives to keep promising more. I started listing them all out and the list of people interested in increasing poverty payouts got too long for a parenthetical. Again, not necessarily a <i>complaint</i>, but let&#x27;s not pretend here that these interests don&#x27;t exist. If you&#x27;d like, celebrate that often comes from something so crass as base political pandering ends up benefiting so many people, instead of a narrow interest group.)<p>I live in the Midwest and I don&#x27;t know anyone living in abject poverty, but I know a lot of struggling families (as in, friends of the family that we socialize with frequently, not just &quot;people I&#x27;ve heard of&quot;). There&#x27;s plenty of them that could afford $44, if you were somehow bringing something to them that was worth it. Which is, after all, the entire point here, to bring them something that will somehow improve their lives more than the cost of buying it, not to just pointlessly drain their wallets. This may very well only work right now in the US, where, yes, even the poor and struggling can afford $44, if it&#x27;s <i>worth</i> it somehow. And on the flip side, while it&#x27;s perhaps harder than you might initially think to bring $44 of value to somebody, it is also a very feasible goal. You don&#x27;t have to work out how to bring them $5000 of value. (Although if you can somehow, awesome. That said the only thing that leaps to mind where you can pay back thousands for a small investment is budgeting apps, and that space is covered.

So what then? Will we stay with Java 6?<p>Well, Scala already does value specialization even on Java 6, so that&#x27;s less urgent. You are right of course, but I think most libraries will simply release new versions that require Java 8, rather than having an intermediate version with no changes except a Java 8 port. But I could be wrong.<p>> In fact I think this upgrade to Java 8 is sort of anti-enterprise. How many companies have you see with projects running on anything newer than Java 6? There are still companies running with Java 1.4 for that matter. Java 8 is bleeding edge and it will remain to be bleeding edge in 2016.<p>I agree - which makes the Typesafe stance rather perverse. Are there really going to be people in 2016 who want to move their Scala to 2.12 so they can call it from Java 8, but would be put off if 2.12 contained any new features? Who won&#x27;t have anyone available to fix even the most minor of syntactic changes? (or not even that - Typelevel is talking about a compiler that accepts all valid Typesafe-scala programs, with all the new syntaxes being things that are currently errors). I really don&#x27;t think including partially applied types, byte/short literals, or singleton types in Scala 2.12 would be a dealbreaker for anyone (though I guess Typesafe has to draw their line in the sand somewhere).<p>What I expect/hope will happen is that Typesafe will accept pull requests for those pieces and some fixing up of macros, which will be enough to make a Scala I&#x27;m happy using until 2017.

(In fact, one of the more reasonable Republican proposals for an alternative to Obamacare is to allow people to buy health insurance across state lines to open up competition.) Similarly, hairdressers need local licenses and are subject to local regulations.

The US started out with fairly powerful state governments and that power has been slowly shifting to the federal government ever since.

In the foreseeable future, I think that only about 20% of the population will end up using this system because for most of Nigeria, life is primarily focused around a cash economy.<p>Nigerian life is rife with many daily issues that foster a large distrust of institutions and the government. Master Card and their POS machines, cash and voting machines would have to build that trust. Life in Nigeria also involves a lot of wary informal trading between many half-educated people (elementary school) who do not use banks, do not use any services that are provided by the government/any large institution, and do not use any automated services at all.<p>That trust is already lost with Mastercard&#x27;s association with the Nigerian government because the relationship between the people and the government is quite sour. The government, the leadership of the country (and a good chunk of the people) are daily involved in corruption.<p>There are many things in Nigeria that you just can&#x27;t actually do except you bribe, or know someone on the inside who will protect you from having to spend money to bribe. Nepotism tends to be the only alternative to bribery. This sort of thing is widespread, from purchasing a car, to passing an exam (yes, sometimes) to just using a roadside mechanic, to driving from point A to point B (you will have to bribe the police to pass a check point, even if you have no fault). Adopting a checks-and-balances master card system in this kind of a society will be ridiculous at best. The everyday institutions, and millions of people (yes millions!) who thrive on these corrupt systems simply do not want such a system. Neither does the government. The government is the most corrupt of all  organizations in Nigeria.<p>Because the problems are so entrenched, it would take a long time for a large portion of the population to start using this. (BTW The voting part of it is a joke, or maybe a dream).<p>Master card is probably only seeking to gain with the growing upper middle class that work in a mostly formal economy and mostly live in Lagos.

(There&#x27;s no less need for systematic testing with Excel, but the people using it often don&#x27;t understand that, and build complex, poorly-tested, bug-ridden systems that look authoritative.)<p>> Ok, you can do it in a better way (faster, online, distributed, ...), but it creates a lot of costs too.<p>More important, it creates costs that are part of the business units expenses, but where the work (and headcount) is elsewhere, meaning that the costs of Excel -- even if they are equal costs -- are often desirable. While managers usually have incentives to cut costs, empire-builders were prefer that, if there are costs that are unavoidable, the associated staff are theirs, not someone else&#x27;s.<p>> In a large corporation, it is not just about the money, they&#x27;ll waste a lot of time just to define what they want and who they want to make it happen.<p>Yes, Excel is often a loophole in horribly broken enterprise IT practices that function more to create bureaucratic overhead and prevent IT work from getting done than to serve the needs of the organization, and rapidly accumulating technical debt by having business staff build complex tools in Excel without consideration of whether its an appropriate tool for the business need outside of the role of Excel as an organizational IT policy hack, without structured testing, etc.<p>OTOH, fixing the broken practices is a better solution.",1409753787

Email is a way of sending a message using a number of old, insecure and inefficient protocols.  Will better alternatives to these protocols gain traction one day?  Most definitely.  What will remain of &quot;Email&quot; as we know it today is the addressing scheme IMO.  The universally acceptable way of messaging a user@any-host is the real power of email, and will remain for the foreseeable future whilst transport and encoding protocols come and go (eg VoIP succeeding PSTN).  In fact, email should last as long as the DNS system exists, given that the addressing system is directly tied to it.  Being a flexible P2P messaging system, email can be easily extended to provide features of any &quot;email-killer&quot; app out there (including realtime communication) if need be.  These innovations haven&#x27;t happened simply because major email server providers dominate their existing markets (Exchange!) and have little incentive to innovate given the high barrier to entry for startups selling email servers to corporates.

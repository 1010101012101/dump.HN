Lots of natural light, lots of wide open spaces, and a general vibe of forcing people to run into each other for interesting conversations. I mean, the main hallway has walls covered in huge blackboards (and chalk stored behind).",1194652134

78020,comment,77892,77892,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I'm surprised how many people don't like syntax highlighting. I appreciate it because it helps me eliminate a small class of errors while coding, which is misspelling keywords and improperly delimiting expressions. In Python, for example, there are 4 different ways to delimit strings, so having syntax highlighting indicates quickly to me when I accidentally ended a multi-line string with a """""" instead of what I began it with: '''.<p>I also find myself doing weird things sometimes when I get tired, like instead of saying ""class Foo"", I'll type ""def class Foo"". Seeing the keyword ""class"" stand out in the second instance is a quick clue that I'm doing something stupid.<p>There are also cases where I've unthinkingly wanted to name a variable the same as a keyword. Without syntax highlighting, I would have received a strange error at compile time complaining about invalid syntax, but instead, I see right away what I've done and avoid the problem altogether.<p>In the end, it's not a matter of whether or not I know my code or know the language inside and out. It's simply a matter of quickly and effectively fixing a large majority of small gaffs in my thinking and inadvertent mistakes. Call it a crutch all you want, but you could just as easily say that if you're not coding in hex, you're using a compiler as a crutch. What's wrong with making your job easier?",1194650455

I&#x27;m talking of creatinine levels in the blood, and my doctor was also very clear on that, and that it wasn&#x27;t normally a concern at the levels she would expect to see from protein supplementation, but if it was too high, she&#x27;d need to establish filtration rate to rule out renal problems.<p>Also, while you may very well be right that GFR would improve, the little bits of reading I&#x27;ve had time to do indicates that unless they did eGFR by measuring his urine over 24 hours, then they likely estimated it from his creatinine levels, and so anything increasing creatinine levels would presumably cause the eGFR value to drop whether or not the increased creatinine levels are due to renal function or anything else.",1377079095

The problem is that you are dead set on your perceived &quot;true meaning&quot; of the word, and you cannot get past anyone using a different definition regardless of how explicit they are about it. My argument is not that the string of letters &quot;politics&quot; is bad, which would then require me to set a precise definition of the word to make my argument fit my other beliefs. My argument is that government is bad, and that participation in government, even with good intentions, is bad. &quot;Politics&quot; is the perfect word to use when referring to &quot;participation in government,&quot; so I used that term. When people brought up a potential different definition of &quot;politics,&quot; I immediately gave the definition I was using in my first claim. That should be the end of the semantic argument, but people persist, many ignoring my actual claim.</i><p>Well, if you have ANOTHER MEANING for the word, why do you feel the need to use the same word, and not another one, even a made-up one?<p>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because, however you might want to define your own definitions, you cannot escape the overall reach of the terms.<p>You argue against semantics, but semantics is all you&#x27;re doing: you&#x27;re not putting forward a different description of politics (explaining how it will work, etc), you&#x27;re just redifining the word to mean something else.<p>If we were allowed to do that, no discussion could ever take place. For one, now other persons in the discussion cannot use the same word in their argumentation, because you just redefined the term.<p>><i>My argument is that government is bad, and that participation in government, even with good intentions, is bad.</i><p>OK, that&#x27;s something we can work with. How is that solved by prefering &quot;anarchy&quot; or &quot;non politics&quot;? Might as well say &quot;I&#x27;m against gravity&quot;. You still are subject to government and it&#x27;s laws. And the only way to change that is:<p>1) Go to some remote area and start a commune.\n2) Convince people to abolish government (which necessitates entering into the political sphere).<p>><i>Again, in this paragraph, you are appealing to your perceived &quot;true meaning&quot; of the word &quot;government,&quot; and until you provide that definition, you haven&#x27;t really presented any ideas that can be intelligently discussed.</i><p>Notice how &quot;his perceived true meaning&quot; is actually the true dictionary meaning everybody agrees upon. You substituted your own definition, and now you act as he is using some weird meaning of his own.<p>It&#x27;s vastly better to avoid redefining any term, and just DESCRIBE (with many words, instead of using a token redefined by you term) what you want to say.<p>That is &#x27;I&#x27;m providing definitions and using those to construct actual ideas, rather than appealing to &quot;true meanings&quot;&#x27; is the worst thing you could possibly do in a coversation. Stop with the redefinitions, and work with descriptions and arguments.<p>><i>Those would be semantic arguments, and I seem to be one of few people in this thread not making semantic arguments.</i><p>On the contrary, you are the one person in this thread that fucked up semantics, by coming with your own definitions of words. That&#x27;s semantics work per se.",1377078810

But as long as we are dependent on mass consumer hardware then there is always a risk of being spied through hardware backdoors. In this case it doesn&#x27;t matter which software we use. Even encryption is useless. It is NOT enough to avoid Windows 8 because the real problem is modern hardware that uses Trusted Computing chips.<p>Trusted Computing (TC) is way more dangerous than classical hardware backdoors. I consider TC an evil technology because it not only takes control away from the user but it even allows to inject faked evidence into computers which could make innocent people -- independent journalists, political activists etc. -- suspect to crime.<p>TC could also be used to delete evidence from computers of journalists who would have no power to keep it. TC allows to control people without letting them even know about it. TC is a huge danger for freedom of speech. It should be banned politcally and boycotted in business. My recommendation: Don&#x27;t buy consumer hardware but use embedded Linux systems with bare bone technology.<p>If we want to be truly secure from being spied then we must do a complete restart with new hardware and software from scratch. There is no way around.<p>I am actually &quot;glad&quot; about the NSA scandal (thank you Snowden) because it woke people up and made them aware of  the reality of global surveilliance, and about the huge threats of Trusted Computing.

I understand that giving immediate feedback is important as it can greatly increase perceived responsiveness, but that damn thing (on both desktop and Windows Phone 8) can climb to ~80% before even the first byte is received (it might even manage ~80% before the DNS lookup has returned though I&#x27;ve not tested to prove that).

It is more convenient than fast food.<p>I actually kinda like the McDonald&#x27;s salads.   I mean, as far as you can like fast food at all.   If you go easy on the dressing, (the dressing comes in a package that looks like a giant-size katsup packet, so you get to decide how much you eat.)   I think it&#x27;s probably pretty healthy, I mean, at least when you compare to shakes.<p>I have used meal-replacement shakes in the past as supplemental breakfast;  I like to load up on calories in the morning, but eating can be... hard before my system wakes up, so the meal-replacement shakes (with as much breakfast as I can choke down) is a reasonable way to consume as many calories as I can in the morning.<p>Of course, for me?  meal-replacement shakes have never quelled hunger like real food, so I&#x27;m no longer using them just because I&#x27;m trying to reduce the number of calories I consume.  If I eat something, it had better make me feel not hungry for a good long time.   I&#x27;m having the best luck with meat and vegetables... the carbohydrates tend to make me hungry shortly afterwards.    On the other hand, I have not lost significant weight.    (I vary from 200 to 195#, and that has been true for some time now.   As far as I can tell, most of that 5# is either water gain or loss, or inaccuracy of my cheap bathroom scale.)  so &quot;you shall know him by his fruits&quot;  - don&#x27;t take my advice on losing weight, as I&#x27;ve not managed to do so myself.<p>Also, a big, sarcastic thanks.  after that &#x27;meal replacement shake&#x27; query on google, now just about every webpage I load is trying to sell me some sort of &#x27;optimized nutrition&#x27; (Google seems to get that I&#x27;m male-identified and thus is trying to sell me the shakes targeted at &#x27;building lean muscle&#x27;  - you know, the stuff with the rippling abs on the can.   Google does not seem to be smart enough to notice that I quite often google things I don&#x27;t intend to buy.   Really, books on what I&#x27;m searching for are usually more appropriate than products I&#x27;m searching for.  Not that I often buy books through ads... but it&#x27;s more likely than me buying nutrition shakes targeted at bodybuilders.)",1377076173

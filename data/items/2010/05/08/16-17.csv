It does seem like they can't just have a manual list of sources, because in many cases, it picks up papers from the websites of their authors, not just from large sources like the ACM or the NIPS proceedings or whatever. But even if you are able to pick out research papers when you crawl the whole web, and get author/title/citation information out of them, how do you rank them? In particular, they have citation links between papers -- but presumably any paper can only cite to older papers, so papers form a DAG, where it seems like PageRank shouldn't really work (because the most 'authoritative' papers would end up being old ones).",1273337305

1330409,story,,,16,22,kyro,"Tell HN: Take My Idea - A Social Calendar",,"I was just now reading through the comments in the ask HN thread about a Facebook alternative and read a reply saying that there lacks a service that really nails event scheduling, which reminded me of an idea I've had for years now that I've yet to see implemented properly. I won't have time to do much of anything in grad school for the next 4 years, so hopefully one of you will find this interesting enough to implement, because I'd definitely use it.<p>The goal is to make the ultimate personal and social calendar. Events are suggested and committed to my calendar manually, via my groups/social circles, and suggestions from friends. The user joins a variety of groups, anywhere from his economics class group to the Justin Bieber fan club, and is also member of social circles that him and his friends have created - ""school friends"", ""research team"", etc. Each group/circle has their own page for group discussions, etc. Any time an authorized group member or friend in a social circle posts an event, it pops up on in the appropriate slot on my calendar. I can then choose to attend/maybe/not attend, comment, and share the event with others, all directly from my calendar. For every event that has occurred, an event page is created for photos/etc and only viewable by group/circle members. Now, I think this would be pretty huge if implemented correctly. The way I see it, the user logs in to their big calendar decorated in flashing notifications of new events occurring or being suggested. He/she also fills in personal events - ""study in library""- and can organize his/her social life around that. Sharing events would be big too, I think.<p>What problem does it solve? Well, one thing I've always hated about Facebook is that it puts all my friends/acquaintances/etc on the same level, and that's not how it works. I want to rank my friends, be part of different social circles, because that's how I operate. With one group of friends I may act totally different than with another. And so a big part of this idea is giving users the freedom to create their own social circles, and define who they are by the circles they join and groups they're members of, and giving them the ability to plan their lives around that. I feel that more closely resembles how we act in real life. We attend a party with one circle, and go to the company dinner with the next, and there's little to no overlap most of the time; and a lot of the times we keep those two circles separate with a wall of privacy, for many obvious and various reasons. With this idea, you get that privacy, that control to choose which circles you're a part of, how to communicate with them, and how to plan your life around them.<p>I know this is something Google Calendar might be trying to accomplish, or what Kiko might have been intended for, but I just don't feel it's been done right. Socializr somewhat aims at doing that, but that site is crap - I've tried it. Biggest competitor is Facebook, clearly.

MySpace was a ""teen"" thing, others before it, too, but Facebook is mainstream; my grandma has a profile, my parents have profiles, and such is true of many.<p>Also mainstream is turning off your computer when you're not using it. Almost every non-techie I know is really interested in having their computer turned off. They don't really care about waiting for it to come back up. Telling them that their profile is only accessible while their computer is on is an instant killer. And what if their internet goes out? They're down for that time too. For people with spotty or wireless connections, saying ""your profile will only work when your connection works, like 30% of the time"", is not going to be too encouraging.<p>What if a user's hard drive dies? Do you really expect people like my 86-year-old grandmother to make backups of her social network profile frequently enough for it to be meaningful? Or what if a user just gets a new computer? Are they going to understand how to transfer the profile?<p>Making users download and run a P2P server 24/7 slows down the computer, increases personal connection bandwidth usage commensurate with one's popularity, and creates a big opening for scammers.<p>I know Facebook would be much less enjoyable if I had to sit around and wait for the dial-up AOL connections of the old people I know to upload their photos. Or even home broadband connections; in the US, those are usually capped at 60-70kbps upload, which is pretty slow.<p>How easy would it be to create a page that looks like your network's page and say ""We've updated our client! This is a special update that we can't auto-update for these smart-sounding technical reasons, so please download and install it."" People would do this immediately because social networks are a major part of their web usage; for some, the only reason they use computer. And your network would be poisoned and the users' profile disabled just that easily.<p>I just don't see how a P2P social network would gain mainstream appeal.

After all, Orkut and Friendster now offer almost everything people are talking about here as the bare minimum any competitor needs.<p>Facebook took off (after the college-only days) for two reasons:<p>1. For people on Myspace, it was worth moving because it didn't look like ass, and it didn't play music at you all the time. For people on Friendster, it didn't crash all the time.<p>2. For older people (still their growth area) it was a place that you were told could be trusted and private: you could put baby pictures on there, you could talk to people you knew, all without worrying about all those warnings your net-savvy friends were telling you about not putting things online.<p>You don't beat Facebook on 1: Despite Farmville, and despite their willingness to allow sheisty third-parties to clutter your news feed, they have a clean, attractive and functional site.<p>You beat them on 2. The reason people aren't outraged about the privacy thing is because they <i>don't know about it</i>. People don't visit their own profiles much, and they certainly never do it as someone else. Even if they try to lock things down they don't realise that ""friend of friend"" doesn't mean people-you-know, it actually means total strangers who happen to have made contact with one of the hundreds of people you know. The rules of the game were changed, and nobody told them.<p>That's where the opportunity is. Create a social network that is for friends only, with very few privacy settings and all defaulting to tight-as-hell, settings that are hard to <i>unlock</i>, and then advertise the hell out of that.<p>I'm sick of hearing ""you don't want stuff public don't put it on the internet"". The internet is bigger than that. I put my email into Gmail, on the internet, and I trust Google not to publish it. We should be able to create a trusted space where people <i>can</i> share things they want to keep private, and pledge that we'll make every effort to keep them that way.<p>Edit: Also, two things from other comments.<p>* If your solution needs people to have their own servers (or to make pretend that a bit of a big co is their own server), you've failed.<p>* If your solution includes the option of ""public"" comments and posts, you've failed.

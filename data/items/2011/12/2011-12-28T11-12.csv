People who can't deal with honesty don't want to be around me, and I end up surrounded by a few friends that I can actually trust, instead of a bunch of phonies.  My relationships have almost no drama at all.<p>I'm not going to say there aren't downsides, though.  It makes dealing with the rest of humanity difficult because strangers still get upset.  As such, I've taken to just smiling at strangers and not talking about anything of substance at all.  If they try to lead it there, I generally just grin and nod no matter the topic.  If they push, I give them full honesty and they either scurry away, or don't.<p>It also caused problems in my previous job because when someone asked a question, I'd give an honest answer instead of hedging.  That made me 'unapproachable' and I took a hit on my yearly review, every year.  I even made a girl cry because I told her she was wrong.  When she said that a manager told her that info, I told her the manager was wrong.  And he was.  100% wrong.  She cried.  She was really good at her job, but just couldn't handle anything outside her world view...  And managers were always right, to her.<p>And of course, romance is tougher...  Last year, I finally found a girl that is open and honest like me, and we have mutual attraction, and it's working out quite well.  Most of my previous relationships died because they were based on lies.  I don't blame them for that, it's just a fact.",1325073570

3399479,comment,3395557,3397673,2,0,alexgieg,,,"I see I'm being down voted for the above comment. I guess it's being interpreted as racist? If so, I apologize, it wasn't my intention, quite the opposite. I'm white, yes, but I live in Brazil, where goods, specially electronic ones, cost 2 to 3 times what they do in the USA, and virtual ones, such as ebooks, which could be cheap, are usually region locked out of our reach. So, I meant the quotes as ironic, as my intention was to criticize companies for doing these price games. As for Asians, I have the utmost respect for them and their achievements, to the point of following Eastern religions (I'm a Shintoist and a Buddhist), so it would never, ever, cross my mind to even come near attacking them. Lastly, although somewhat I'm articulate in English, it's a second language for me, and one I learned by myself through books, not by attending classes, my native one being Portuguese, so it can also be the case that the way I expressed myself didn't come out as I intended (expressing sarcasm properly is way more difficult than writing in a straightforward way). So, if that also came into play, please let me apologize again!<p>And, if it'd be possible for someone to, taking into account the above, point me what exactly I did wrong in the original comment, so that I can avoid such mistakes in the future, please do so, as being a non-native speaker there's no other way for me to know other than asking someone who is. I'd love to read it, and be sure I'll start applying the lesson immediately!<p>Thanks!",1325072927

3399434,comment,3392567,3392567,1,0,dgroves,,,"The simplest metaphor is that Programmers are teachers who instruct the severely developmentally disabled to do routine tasks in a foreign language.<p>I say that they teach the severely developmentally disabled because computers are very, very simple compared to humans. Thus programers are disciplined to break everything down into the seemingly simplest and mundane of details; because if they don't, the students will get even the simplest of tasks incorrect. Programmers speak a foreign language because the computer is to literal minded to speak a language where words have multiple definitions; and so the Programmer must speak with the computer in a foreign language where words have only one precise definition in order to instruct the computer to do its task.<p>This is very metaphorical; and programmers may or may not appreciate the metaphor. But, as a former programmer I believe that at a very simple level, this metaphor very closely resembles what a programmer does. In actuality the very detail oriented programmers know that the map is not the territory, and that exceptions exist for even the most basic expressions of ideas. A metaphor obviously doesn't map well to all the numerous exceptional cases that exist in practice, however, it is map enough for you to understand 'what it means, and what he does.'",1325071722

Assuming constant acceleration, the firing requires a shell acceleration of 1.5E10 g, which is done in 130 microseconds.<p>A velocity change of 0.008 m/s in 130 microseconds means the ship itself has an average acceleration of about 60m/s/s or about 6 g. However, this assumes the entire ship is rigidly coupled to the firing system. If held together by normal structural forces, which propagate at best at multiples of the speed of sound, then no more than 1/2 meter of other structure can be involved. It's more likely the equipment itself will have 100s of g of stress.<p>The acceleration requires 1.5E14 Joules, or 35 kT of TNT, which is what the clip said.",1325071562

While I have never been able to fully implement it, there is something in radical honesty that rings very true to me. I now realize it is about Blanton's diagnosis: lying will rotten your life, by forcing you to create a self that is far from your true being. Nothing new here, Di Mello and Tolle have modernly approached the same subject from different angles, while it has been covered in many philosophical and spiritual texts throughout history.<p>But Blanton proposes a kind of shock therapy that, while possibly effective, is extremely difficult to put into daily practice. In short, by always telling the truth you will eventually build a fulfilling life, but you will have to go through a lot of drama and resentment, possibly pushing a lot of people away from you during the process.<p>Is it possible to do it in a better way? I really don't know, but I have tried a lot of things in the last couple of years that seems to be working. It basically involves trying to build a lifestyle where I just don't need to lie anymore. Start-ups are great for that compared to other work environments, but so is moving to smaller communities, being completely open and honest with family and friends, etc.<p>Whenever I put myself in a position where people's opinions can significantly impact my (perceived?) well-being, I find it very hard to be totally honest and close to my true self.",1325071083

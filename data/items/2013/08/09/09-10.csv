However at least in Germany I see another problem: Almost every job ad for a programming positition starts with &quot;Computer science or related degree required&quot;. Without a degree you are just filtered out by the Human Resources Department that doesn&#x27;t know anything about programming at all. They are just checking formalities and doing buzzword matching. You won&#x27;t even get to an interview or get an opportunity to prove your skills. :-(",1376042369

6184688,comment,6184397,6184406,2,0,616c,,,"As someone who is a big supporter of Firefox Sync [0]:<p>What will this provide me over Firefox Sync, which has a built in encryption layer on their (admittedly cloud) service?  I can pull their code and host my own Firefox sync server, and someone has written a special PHP-based version for inclusion into OwnCloud.  So, what is so special here except the use of buzzword P2P? (See next question below.)<p>How will you do to P2P without some kind of centralized bootstrapping service with the prevalence of NAT and people who do not know how to port-forward?  (I just saw the Github repos, so I will examine this myself in a bit.)<p>UPDATE: It would appear you are using mDNS and/or Zeroconf [1] to handle this?  I am still not sure how this will ease the NAT and/or syncing over public Internet.<p>Why should I trust you?  What have you done other than this project?  Not to be increasingly blunt, but you are not the Mozilla Foundation and your Github repos do not show much other than work on co-routines and AD service wrappers.  That is useful to me, but I would like to see more security work and knowledge of crypto libraries if I trust you with password manager code.  What else do you work on?  Your blog does not show me too much, and I cannot find much mention of you to warrant 60,000 USD for such a project.  I am correct in seeing you a Marketing/Product Manager?  Sorry to be harsh, but honestly I think most of HN would be worried about these points.<p>UPDATE: Ok, maybe I was a little too harsh; you do seem to have some more experience than I had previously estimated, given some Googling and your Linkedin profile, if legit.

It&#x27;s been working fine over the last month or so of testing. In MacOSX, I&#x27;ve got both EncFS over FUSE and the commercial BoxCryptor packaged version happly working together. I&#x27;ve got Ubuntu 9 & 12.04LTS, ARCH Linux on a RaspberryPi, and iOS on my phone and iPad all syncing some or all of those EncFS containers and successfully reading/writing them. I haven&#x27;t tried, but I have no reason to doubt BoxCryptor will happily read/write those filesystems on Windows and Android.<p>One thing I particularly like about this setup, is that I can have encrypted data synced to a machine that doesn&#x27;t have the decryption key (or even software) on it  my media server and a machine at work are &quot;backing up&quot; all that data without it being &quot;exposed&quot; even if a machine and disks get stolen/confiscated.<p>This is different to a truecrypt volume, in that the files are still discrete:<p><pre><code>  [Bigs-MacBook-Pro:~/Dropbox/BoxCryptor-DB.bc] bigiain% ls -l\n  total 7544\n  -rw-r--r--@  1 bigiain  admin      625 12 Jun 10:59   !IMPORTANT BoxCryptor Information.txt\n  -rw-r--r--@  1 bigiain  admin        0 12 Jun 11:07 Hmz6h72bplJbH1\n  drwxr-xr-x@  3 bigiain  admin      102 12 Jul 18:01 QY7,wBj6mQwGV7OyD3Qbll8\n  drwxr-xr-x  50 bigiain  admin     1700 23 Jul 22:21 WoVrJB-gyKVMm0\n  -rw-r--r--@  1 bigiain  admin  3840262  6 Aug 09:40 Z8,UY5cp7Ux491OckZ9yXM2\n  -rw-r--r--@  1 bigiain  admin    15364  7 Aug 21:25 nMrARYb-KDbdDj2\n</code></pre>\nindividual files can get synced as the change, without needing to re-sync the entire volume. On the downside, that means I leak some metadata, file sizes and modification dates, but not names or contents.

As a perk for funding Bluepass, whatever the price turns out to be, your version will include unlimited free upgrades.<p>The source of the mobile versions will be available, but for the success of a project, a recurring revenue stream is required to maintain them.

Companies like degrees because they&#x27;re an easy, lazy way to (at least in the minds of HR people) establish a competency baseline, and if it&#x27;s true that most companies would rather have false negatives than false positives, it&#x27;s easy to see why a degree would be &quot;required&quot; in a lot of cases.

There are between 20,000 and 30,000 people with a probable personality disorder.<p>Looking at the psychotic and mood disorders, and putting it very simply, you hospitalise for a short time while you stabilise the illness and sort out the meds.  Then you release the patient back to the community with intense support from community workers (daily, weekly, monthly visits).  You give an easy route back into services when these people need it.  You also provide vocational support - help people back into work and to integrate back into society.<p>Now look at what happens to people with a personality disorder.  There&#x27;s no real treatment.  This used to mean they were specifically excluded from treatment - turned away from specialist MH services.  That doesn&#x27;t happen anymore, but there&#x27;s not much that can be done.  And behaviours are often much closer to &quot;bad&quot; than &quot;mad&quot;, and so criminal justice is involved a lot more than MH services.<p>Here&#x27;s a harrowing Grauniad article (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/mar/30/prisonsandprobation.mentalhealth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/mar/30/prisonsandpro...</a>) (contains description of self harm and suicidal behaviour)<p>> <i>On the day Diane Kent set herself on fire in her cell at Low Newton prison, County Durham, two months ago, she had already tried to hang herself twice and asked a prison officer to take away her lighter because she was scared of harming herself.

Sites you log into using Persona never ask for, see, or store a password for you.<p>The certificates are transient (they expire within 24 hours). The assertions generated by your browser are transient (they expire within 5 minutes). The keypairs generated and stored by your browser can be transient (you don&#x27;t need to use the same keypair each time you sign in to your identity provider), and are tied to a specific email address and browser instance.<p>The whole thing is also designed to be decentralized. For most people, for now, Mozilla is the identity provider, but you can run your own (relatively easy) or use a trusted third-party provider. All that matters in a provider is that it speaks the protocol.<p>This means that comparing Persona to &quot;password authentication&quot; or &quot;two-factor auth&quot; is not really a useful question; your provider can use any mechanism you both agree on to verify you and give you a certificate. Though the immediate big win is, of course, that if there&#x27;s a password involved, only the provider ever handles it, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a bunch of sites&#x27; password-storage practices, and you may not even have to worry about your provider&#x27;s (if your provider doesn&#x27;t use passwords to verify you).<p>The provider also doesn&#x27;t know what sites you&#x27;re signing in to with Persona; they don&#x27;t receive the assertion from the site you sign into, they just provide a copy of their public key so the site can complete verification.",1376041176

By no means this is a 3rd world country - we have pretty strong IT industry (e.g. some globally successful antivirus companies etc.) and the country is certainly developed enough to host companies providing SAAS. Yet we have certain advantages against the US:<p>1. our government is way weaker than the US government - their resources are obviously not even close and they would not be able to do what US government does even if they wanted to. But we are still an EU state and we can use EU as a shield when Americans come knocking.<p>2. it is a post-communist country and people still remember the experience of living in totalitarian/authoritarian country. Opposition against any sign of &#x27;bad old times coming back&#x27; seem to be much stronger than the opposition of common American people against recent freedom-stripping. For example there was a proposal that our internet providers should be required to block un-licensed online gambling. The public backslash against &#x27;censorship&#x27; was so big that the plan had to be abandoned in few days and the politician who proposed it had to apologize. Many things that are now normal in US or UK and some other western countries would not be possible here.<p>3. we are still an &#x27;American ally&#x27; but the US are not nearly as popular with common people as they used to be here and anti-Americanism seem to be growing. Many politicians exploit that and see opposing to American requests as an easy way to score political points (we have seen this for example when US government wanted to build a part of their missile defence system here).",1376039995

6184504,comment,6174969,6181980,2,0,qammm,,,"It seems we have different definitions of what type inference, higher order functions and Turing completeness means. :-) Regarding coroutines in Java: I don&#x27;t know if libraries using native continuation mechanisms or bytecode manipulations prove that Java (the language) has continuation support. :-) I don&#x27;t have anything against Scala. In my very first message I even said that I see the odds for Scala winning higher than the odds for Clojure winning - because I already see some enterprise adoption of Scala. Although I see the probability of Scala winning quite low. As you noticed with Java 8 Java is already borrowing a lot of useful things from Scala. I am sure conservative corporate decision makers will see less and less reasons to switch to Scala as time passes by. Also I don&#x27;t think that Java sucks. I was just making a point from personal productivity experience. Your experience might differ from that.<p>If I have a function:\ndef upcase(s: String): String...\nThe compiler with its static type system can tell me if e. g. I am trying to call the upcase function with an Int argument. But in my experience something like that just does not happen very often. Most programmers are not so stupid that they try to fit a square peg in a round hole. ;-)<p>A unit test can check if the returned string is really the upcase version of the input parameter. Plus if the programmer would really assume that he could upcase an Int it would just as well give the feedback that his assumption was wrong-like the compiler.",1376039325

That company has since closed - as I suspected it would (the entire team of 10 was Polish guys and gals and as it turns out they just wanted a presence in the country and farm out all the work back to Poland). Programmers in the US are totally spoiled right now, as there is a huge demand for them, but its not the same elsewhere.

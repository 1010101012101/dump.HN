Good piece of trivia: In addition to creating the class, he taught the last (ever) offering of 6.001 last term at MIT.<p>Another piece of trivia: Hal Abelson, the co-creator, was one of the big guys being 6.001's replacement (now in Python).",1201150357

103293,comment,103100,103288,0,0,curi,,,"So suppose a criminal breaks into your house. And he's got a knife, and you're frail, so you better shoot him. Add more details if you want, so it's clearly justified self defense.<p>Now add a reason that doing this kills the criminal's innocent son. He left his son tied up at home, and was planning to untie the kid when he returned, but he never got home, and the kid wasn't found in time and starved to death. Or the man actually was a good father, but he and his son were involved in a dangerous project, and he would have been fine, but now without his father's help, he is killed.<p>So, defending yourself caused an innocent to die.<p>But it wasn't wrong of you to do that. The fault lies with the criminal. He is responsible for getting himself shot by breaking into your house and trying to rob and murder you. And because getting himself shot is his responsibility, so are the consequences. He got his own son killed, not you.<p>Agree so far?",1201149345

103287,comment,103120,103253,0,0,Leon,,,"True, but the article is not focusing on information to correct mistaken ideas, but on the rise of a terrible fad among teens in several small communities.  The article tells how some kids think it is 'cool', that those who have followed receive attention after they are gone in the form of websites, and that it is easier to discuss and deal with feelings on social websites instead of with family members or mental health professionals.  I am just worried that a youth viewing such a news article might receive the wrong impression.<p>I do agree with you, but I still have criticism with this article specifically.  They do not even give information on hot-lines, websites, or anonymous groups to help those who need/want help.",1201148510

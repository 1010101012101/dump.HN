Probably not.  GUIs trade learning for speed.  You never have to learn anything, but you'll never be fast.  The GUI will always be in your way, slowing down your work.  TeX is the opposite -- you have to read a lot to get started, but then the only difficult or tedious part of writing will be the subject matter you're writing about.  The only barrier between your mind and beautiful output will be your slow fingers :)<p>LyX and Texmacs are a good compromise, however.  You can write the code when you're comfortable doing so, but you can click stuff when you're learning.",1209851362

An odd name, but good software nonetheless.  (You can export to TeX if you want, but that's not its native format.)",1209851227

The article would have been much more interesting if after his whole ""smell"" thing, he ended up saying this one smells bad. But because its a positive article, one is left wondering why he couldn't actually come up with something substantive, that the best thing he could think of to say was that the company had a nice aroma.",1209850759

Add a few lines describing where your backend servers are to the config file, save it, and start perlbal.<p>For our $WORK applications, we just have an apache that proxies to the backend FastCGI apps.  We don't have a ton of load, so that works fine.  (We might be switching to nginx, which is much simpler than Apache for this use case.)",1209849035

The previous three quarters were profitable for Sun (which was a pretty amazing turnaround--Sun was in <i>deep</i> trouble before Schwartz took the helm).<p>The thing that a lot of folks haven't realized is that the nerds have recaptured the flag within Sun.  And, you know what happens when a bunch of nerds are on a mission.  That's right: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/67user"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/67user</a><p>OK, so maybe putting the nerds in charge isn't a guarantee of success, but it is a prerequisite in a tech company.<p>Everybody can probably think of one cool thing Sun is doing, because it touches on your specific area...but when you do an aerial survey of the whole Sun ""cool stuff"" landscape, it looks really impressive:<p>Zones - A sweet elastic computing solution.  More efficient than Xen (due to different model...more like vservers on Linux, but it's actually stable enough to use), allows quite impressive run-time configuration like scaling resources up and down, etc.<p>JVM for dynamic languages - Sun has drunk the Koolaid on dynamic languages, and is actively contributed to a bunch of them.  I think they are beginning to understand that Java is not the important thing to come out of Sun, but the JVM and that huge library is.<p>Cheap hardware - Really, you can buy Sun boxes for not too much more than equivalent Dell systems.  And, Sun boxes are <i>nice</i>.  They don't have as many low-end options as Dell, of course, but once you get into high end gear where Dell loses its huge quantity advantages, Sun is a viable option.<p>MySQL - Most popular database in the world.  Hard to top that for importance in the industry.  During web 1.0 they had to team up with Oracle to offer the whole solution...now they've got the full stack.<p>Caroline - Utility computing, elastic computing, ""App Engine"", call it what you will...Sun is building a commodity solution to the problem.<p>Will all of this make up for years of resting on their laurels?  I dunno...but it's too early to count them out, and Schwartz seems to have played an important role in the change.",1209848579

Most deviate only the tiniest fraction from what is dictated by their background and mentors.  Not Malcolm X.

Many would disagree with me on that last point though, with good cause.<p>As an agnostic &quot;white devil&quot;, I doubt Malcolm X and I would have been able to tolerate each other, even very late in his life.

At first expect your productivity to go down seriously, because everything will be strange and new. But persist with it and force yourself to use it. Once you get to the nicer bits you probably will not want to go back. After 6 months of regular use, you will not be able to back, every other editor will feel dumb and will frustrate you to no end (be careful when typing email: ESC key dismisses the compose dialog in a lot of email programs without asking you anything :D).<p>As for UNIX shell and tools, again get a good BASH tutorial book and learn the basics of interactive shell, learn how to do loops, globs etc. The rest is then all about learning individual tools, not shell itself, which is rather small command interpreter. Look in your /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin for commands and read their man pages. Experiment a lot with them and look at examples of creative use of these.<p>Back in the early 90s I had a year long course in vi (not Vim) but started using Vim on Amiga 500 days, and after 20 years I still come across new commands and ways to do things.

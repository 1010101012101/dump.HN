1188429,comment,1187282,1187728,0,0,raganwald,,,"> A better example: a customer loses their drivers license/bank card and a thief finds it calls a bank to do transactions, using the info on the card to verify identity... A bank can only do so much to protect their customers. If someone is willing to leave their info lying around, there isnt much that can be done.<p>I don't understand this argument at all. Are we talking about customers leaving their information ""lying around"" or customers entrusting it to Netflix? I entrust my money to a bank: I give it to them. Customers entrust their transaction history to Netflix. Nobody is talking about customers leaking their private information to third parties, we are talking about the equivalent of the bank publishing the customer's driver's license information in a newspaper with their name obscured.<p>p.s. Now that I've established that I don't think this example is particularly relevant, I will share a story: Several years ago I returned from vacation to find a phone message from my bank. Someone had used what appeared to be my ATM card to withdraw $1,000 from my account while I was in Honduras. Of course I was the victim of some kind of skimming and cloning operation.

I'm not saying you can bypass the second two factors with just a network, but with a strong network, it only helps. Someone can help you introduce the product to the world and someone very smart can give you great advice, if you don't fool yourself into thinking you don't need mentoring from some of the best in the industry. I've learned a great deal by seeking advice from these leaders.\nI wasn't completely sold on a MBA before coming to GSB and that's why it took me longer to come than average classmates. I almost didn't come, with the same perspective you may have. \nHowever, having spent 1.5 years here, I think it's really worthwhile even though it used up all my savings prior to business school (yes, it's expensive). I did actually learn valuable lessons from many industry veterans who are sharing their many years of learning with us about sales, marketing, management, finance, entrepreneurship, VC, etc. Believe me, I'm a stronger believer in learning from doing it, as I'm currently building a business while in school.

I realized that when people go to websites to look at pictures of events, they are really looking for pictures of themselves so I setup a site that allowed a small niche (Jamaicans specifically - because I am Jamaican) to upload their own photos. This was early 2003, so pre-facebook, flickr, myspace, youTube, etc.<p>Anyway, the initial feedback I got was very positive and I saw a surge in traffic with nothing but word of mouth. However, I had used an off-the-shelf script and at the time didn't know any programming so couldn't grow the site more than what I initially put up.<p>I decided to throw a games section there just to see what happens. I went to college and eventually the site got neglected, I did nothing, but for some reason the traffic for the games section would not go away.<p>I literally have not updated the site in about 2 - 3 years (the forums, the photo gallery, nothing). The most I have done was changed the home page about 6 months ago to add that survey.io link.<p>Needlesss to say, for the last 2 years, I have been averaging about 2000 - 5000 unique visitors, with a relatively low bounce rate (25%), average pageviews of 6.7, avg time on site of 06m:39s.<p>Last month, 35% of all my traffic came from the keywords ""fiwishop games"".<p>I used to have Google Ads on the site, but they would perform poorly, because they were mainly for text content - which I don't have, so I have since removed them.<p>I am thinking of putting up some HeyZap games - given that that's the most popular part of the site, to gain some additional income - but would love to hear some ideas on other ways I can possibly monetize the site and grow traffic in a meaningful (non-spammy) way. I am not trying to be the next YouTube or Flickr, just want to be able to generate at least a few hundred per month - and scale to more than that if possible.<p>Thanks much in advance, feel free to ask any additional questions and I will try to get as much feedback as possible.<p>Edit:<p>In the last month, these are some of the stats straight from GA:<p>28,204 Pageviews \n18,319 Unique Views \n25.37% Bounce Rate<p>/Flash_Games/New/index.html   6,341	 22.48%\n/Flash_Games/index.html       5,516	 19.56%\n/index2.html                  2,420	 8.58%\n/                             2,408	 8.54%\n/Flash_Games/New/DragRacer.html 1,300	 4.61%<p>Not ""major"" traffic, by any stretch of the imagination, but at the very least something to start with.<p>Also note that any suggestions would be able to be integrated with Paypal for me to receive payment.",1268452112

People do it all of the time. We all need to make a living somehow, right?<p>I think one mistake that may have been made in this case, and others may disagree with me, is that there was (as far as I know) no disclaimer about the content not being free forever. I think some people stumble upon a resource like Mixergy, see it's free, and get used to it being free. And once the owner of the content decides to start charging for access, it feels as though something has been taken away.<p>While I realize that it probably isn't rational to think that way, I think that many people do engage in that kind of thought process.

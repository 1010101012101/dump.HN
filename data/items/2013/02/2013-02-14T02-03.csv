And then for whatever reason they gain insight -- be that practice, or ritual, or psychedelics -- they get it. A lot of things open up. There's a whole layer of meaning in textual traditions that opens up, and you realize a <i>lot</i> of people have been trying to say the same things. And you wonder how you missed it?<p>And then you want to go back. Now you jump into the practice diligently, to try to get back to that peak experience. The thing is, peak experiences are just that. Like all things, they come and go.<p>Coming through the psychedelics, it is easy to spend a lot of time taking hit after hit to get back to that peak experience. It was part of why people who have not been initiated into this fear it. They see people drifting out from the real world, and these people then say crazy things like, ""well, reality is much bigger than you think.""<p>The thing is, this happens in any mystical traditions. Someone who realized these insights while sitting on a cushion starts become uninterested in anything but sitting on that cushion.<p>Which is ironic because all of this is about experiencing reality, not escaping from it. That is another reason I pointed out the connection with vipassana. The point is to <i>experience</i> reality, something that seems counterintuitive when people talk about psychedelics.<p>Usually, you have a sangha -- people who are cultivating with you, whatever the modality -- helps you stay grounded.<p>Generally speaking, once you had some psychedelic experience, you'd find meditating much easier.

In the case of heroku there is a special header that they pass which describes the queuing duration.  Because we're in the ruby application we don't have control over whether this timestamp is accurate but I'm very interested in ideas on how we could do a better job in this situation.<p>We do provide javascript based browser instrumentation (""Real User Monitoring"") which measures request time from the browser's perspective.

5217324,comment,5215364,5216676,5,0,hosh,,,"Thanks, I'm glad you like these.<p>I was deeply influenced by the writings of Daniel Ingram. I encountered his book shortly after my first set of experiences, and the experiences were not like anything I had read about or assumed. Despite the controversy around his books, he has a framework I find useful.<p>He introduced the notion of a ""concentration object"", and I realized you can use <i>anything</i> as a concentration object. Since a lot of people are out of touch with the senses, it is better to use a physical sense as the concentration object -- breathing, candle, etc. at least until you realized enough insights to go straight to just being.<p>However, you can also use concentration objects that are constructed. They come and go anyways, so why wouldn't you use something that is not there? I have a wide network of acquaintances with people practicing all sorts of traditions, and I can render what they do in these terms. There is a whole class of practices where you create the concentration object and the concentrate on it. For example: a Buddhist mandala or pathworking the Sephiroth in Kabbalah.<p>Where I find it useful in coding has more to do with the concentration skills gained from one-point concentration. So that is not strictly vipassana.<p>However, more importantly, it has allowed me to consider code on its own merits instead of reacting to my Jungian shadows or to other Jungian shadows. There's a tendency for nerds and geeks to get emotional about their code, even defend it, and yet they will not admit to the emotions that run amok. Look in any thread about ""What is the best programming language?"" and you'll see it.<p>Another useful thing is that ... knowing things come and go, that there is always an <i>ending</i> to anything that begins, means it is easier to let go of code. You don't get attached to code, so you have attachments to keeping it around. Leaving commented out code. Or diving back in and refactoring. Or recognizing when you are about go yak shaving, and no, that neat feature you did really isn't that important.<p>Finally, as your awareness broadens, you really start thinking about just what kind of impact your code is making. Not in the social activist sense so much as one deeply informed by the realization you've gained on the cushion. Do you really want to be working on another social network for cats?<p>Hope that helps, maybe provide some interesting things to explore :-)",1360809395

Cell! Cell!"", but, based on the games that have come out, how they compare with the XBox 360, the hype, and all the breakdowns I've read about how the internals of the PS3 work, basically Gaben here is all but objectively correct. The PS3 is a very poorly balanced machine; it is full of bits and pieces that have a lot of power, but it's virtually impossible to actually hook them all up to each other and have them all firing at full power at the same time. All the powerful parts are crippled by lack of bandwidth to move data in or out of them.<p>None of this looks like bitterness or permanent anger, so if Sony builds a better-engineering PS4, with a focus on real performance over benchmarks and marketing hype, there's nothing in that rant that would preclude working with them. I hope Sony has people internally who understand the PS3 to be less than the sparkling gem of design that the marketing department wanted people to think it was.",1360809322

If you can obtain a patent for any random thing a competent person could come up with in an hour, then there's no utility to be had in making the invention public.<p>When patents work well (and I'm sure they do in many cases), people will <i>want</i> to search for patents that cover what they're trying to do, because if they find anything good, it'll save them a lot of effort to license the patent rather than invent things from scratch.<p>Imagine having a really hard software problem, and searching the patent database for something that could help. In an ideal world, you might run across something useful, contact the patent holder, and work out a licensing arrangement. In our world, you're unlikely to find anything good, and if you do, the holder is unlikely to be willing to license it to you fairly. Meanwhile, there's a good chance of coming across a stupid patent that applies to what you're doing, that doesn't tell you anything you couldn't come up with on your own, but that you now would owe triple damages for if you used it, because it's willful infringement now that you know about the patent.<p>In short, the patent system can be useful, but the system <i>must</i> ensure that patents are only awarded for inventions that deserve it.

Per Wikipedia, this is the list of games developed by id Software (200+ employees) since 2004:<p><i>- Wolfenstein 3D Classic (2009)</i><p><i>- Doom Classic (2009)</i><p><i>- Quake Live (2010)</i><p><i>- Rage HD (2010)</i><p><i>- Rage (2011)</i><p><i>- Doom 3 BFG Edition (2012)</i><p>Of those, probably only Rage sold a significant number of copies across all platforms. id Software also published the following games in the same time frame:<p><i>- Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil  Nerve Software (2005)</i><p><i>- Quake 4  Raven Software (2005)</i><p><i>- Doom RPG  Fountainhead Entertainment (2005)</i><p><i>- Orcs & Elves  Fountainhead Entertainment (2006)</i><p><i>- Enemy Territory: Quake Wars  Splash Damage (2007)</i><p><i>- Wolfenstein RPG  Electronic Arts (2008)</i><p><i>- Doom Resurrection  Escalation Studios (2009)</i><p><i>- Wolfenstein  Raven Software (2009)</i><p>Of those, my guess is that only Quake 4, and maybe Wolfenstein, sold in significant amounts.<p>Since 2004, Valve has shipped HL2:EP1, HL2:EP2, Portal, Team Fortress 2, L4D 1, L4D 2, Portal 2, Alien Swarm and CS:GO. While none was the hit that HL2 was, few studios have achieved that level of success in the same time frame.<p>Or take a look at Blizzard. They have at least five, maybe ten times as many employees as Valve, but have released ""only"" five or six games since 2004, most of which were WoW extensions.<p>My point is that if Valve is not shipping games at a faster pace, it's because they can afford it. Steam is probably printing enough money that they can afford to spend as much time as they want iterating on their engines and games. I would be very surprised if you were right about the motivations for the layoff.<p>""Valve is going to build a new cross-platform engine [...] HL3 will be the showcase for this engine.""<p>This isn't much of a prediction. HL2 was released on multiple platforms, and it is reasonable to assume that HL3 will follow suit.<p>Edit: Gabe Newell has addressed the speculations.

There would be logic, right?  They had harbored a known murderer and killer, who had gone and killed thousands of people.  The Afghans were responsible, in some sense, for the safety from which he operated, and culpable by knowledge of his aims.  They should have settled him a long time ago.  So let them settle the problem now, or pay the price.<p>By _your_ logic.  Which is stupid.  If everyone behaved that way the world would be completely unlivable.  The US is by no means perfect but it is, by and large, a nation of laws.  That means very little to those innocents killed in its mistakes and evils, but means an enormous amount to the very many people who are not killed by its adherence to some standard of humanity.  And to all of us, living in a world where the mighty hold themselves in some manner accountable to something looking like justice.<p>Here is a thought experiment on the difference between the likes of the US and bin Laden.  Imagine what bin Laden would have done if he got ahold of, say, a single nuclear missile submarine.  Or any of the destructive powers of this country.  That is the difference between an imperfectly ethical power, and a murdering piece of crap.  For me, I think it is a really, really important difference.",1360807892

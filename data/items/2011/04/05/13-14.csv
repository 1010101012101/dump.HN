Far from what I would call a pet project.<p>But to each his own.  Again, my whole argument is not about elastic or scaling apps (where I <i>totally</i> get the value), it's about their non-elastic intro package and the value you would get from it (no scaling and limitations on what you can do compared to your own vanilla dedicated box) versus a dedicated cloud server that costs 1/3 of the price.<p>If they want to bring in customers initially onto their platform (which makes it way easier to upsell to the elastic service when the time comes), they might need to adjust their base pricing a bit to be competitive with similar (non-scaling) offerings.<p>I say this because unlike other application stacks like Rails, setting up a proper basic hosting stack in PHP is dead simple for a lot of people, so the bar is a lot lower than rolling you own for those other stacks.",1302011831

In this case, there wouldn't be an opportunity to install redis, 0mq, or amqp. The database approach might work, but the servers are distributed and might not allow remote connections.

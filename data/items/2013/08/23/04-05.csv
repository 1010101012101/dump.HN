6261774,comment,6258422,6259600,2,0,diydsp,,,"fwiw, i started dating a lawyer and she and I went deep into the 100-mile free zone topic.  Me, on the paranoid side and she, siding with the SCOTUS.  We spent a few hours researching Supreme Court cases and eventually found lots of details.  I&#x27;ll try to relate the most important nuances.  1. it&#x27;s not an official u.s. policy.  i love the ACLU, i&#x27;m a member, but they&#x27;re inducing some unnecessary fear.  2. you can&#x27;t be unreasonably searched, they have to have some reason.  typically, this reason is immigration.  3. this power to search has been challenged in the Supreme Court repeatedly.  in some cases it was upheld, b/c the primary reason for the search was immigration.  in others, the executive branch could not hold up the case and it was dropped.  so, checks and balances still work.  4. after searching for immigration, anything they find such as drugs or explosives is utterly admissible.  so immigration is often used as a pretense, but they can&#x27;t get away with arbitrary immigration searches  5. it&#x27;s not just 100 miles around the border, it&#x27;s also around every port of entry, such as airports.<p>I hope this helps.  I really wish she or other lawyers like her would interpret this stuff for everyday people like you and me.  The government and the ACLU both seem to benefit from our ignorance (and the fear we inherit due to it), so neither is incentivized to present the true picture.. and that&#x27;s the real problem.",1377233382

6261771,comment,6256542,6260387,1,0,icambron,,,"> There has to be a sweet spot between telling everyone immediately, inciting a panic<p>I disagree. Perfect transparency is always the right way to go with epidemic diseases. That information will go through all kinds of natural filters: scientific journalists who can dispense useful advice, foreign governments that can refer to quarantine policies, and every day people who can make tradeoffs about the risks they&#x27;re willing to face. Far worse is having a bunch of seemingly arbitrary restrictions imposed because of--in the minds of citizenry--some vague but clearly terrifying disease is killing people, but about which the populace has no useful information.<p>Cures don&#x27;t really come out quickly, or even vaccines. The main way you stop a disease by preventing its spread, not curing it. So what ideally comes out quickly is guidelines and simple preventative measures. Watch for these signs and report them. Don&#x27;t spend time around people coughing. Wear a mask. Etc. And people have to know that stuff if they&#x27;re going to be part of the solution, not to mention the everyday medical professionals at your local hospital (with no connection to the WHO) who need to know who to isolate and what preventative measures to take. And of course they need to know how bad it is in order to prioritize it relative to other concerns. Concealing from people what&#x27;s happening makes all of that harder.<p>We saw with SARS in the West that epidemics can be overblown, but there wasn&#x27;t widespread panic and the widespread availability of information allowed people to choose how much to guard against it. I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s your right to overreact to accurate information. And in the end, it wasn&#x27;t some magic cure that stopped SARS; it&#x27;s was fast response and quarantine.<p>Anything other than complete transparency about public health issues is immoral.",1377233221

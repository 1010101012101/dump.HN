266520,comment,266218,266391,0,0,Prrometheus,,,">Just an observation, but societies with vast disparities of wealth tend to be poorer overall and to have flatter economic growth.<p>I would love some numbers to back up that claim. I know that poor repressive governments tend to have high income disparity while the Western world tends to have less. However the last time I looked at the numbers I don't think the data showed that income disparity is a major causal factor in making a country poor or rich. It sounds to me like that is the dream of envious leftists, one of many unquestioned assumptions that they like to bring up in every debate.<p>There's a difference between a third-world country where the favored friends of the state are well-off while everybody else starves (see Zimbabwe) and a rich country where everybody is well-off but some are more well-off than others (see Britain). I question the ""if you don't give us more money, we'll riot and break stuff"" justification for income redistribution in a rich first-world country.<p>Also, third-world countries should be focused on getting rich, not redistributing what little wealth they have. I am highly skeptical of the benefits of income redistribution under any circumstances.",1217872756

266477,comment,266218,266369,0,0,time_management,,,"<i>Of course, with redistribution, that actually becomes the case...</i><p>Redistribution is a necessary evil, though. It's zero-sum* in the immediate term, but it's a necessary upkeep measure for the long-term health of society.<p>Money is essentially a device for allocating resources to those who have put them to good/profitable use in the past. The problem with it is that there are so many degeneracies, such as crime and dumb luck, that also influence the flow of money. Foremost among these degeneracies is the way money is filtered through large corporations. Large companies profit or fail on account of reasonable market forces, but then go ahead and distribute the money in a manner that has 100 times more to do with office politics than actual productivity. Inheritances are also an enormous corrupting influence, in that they bequeath large amounts of capital to individuals who are entirely unworthy of the influence that it provides.<p>I tend to think of money and capitalism as shoddy (but the best we have) AI algorithms that need to be continuously tweaked in order to avoid divergence. If you start from an initial state where everyone is roughly equal, and allow capital to flow via a money economy, you'll have a system where more productive people have more control of the resources, and progressive improvements will result. Eventually, though, the degeneracies take over, and it starts to erode society; an elite selected <i>not</i> on merit emerges, and uses its influence to restructure society in its favor further, much in the way a cancer starves a body.<p>(* edit: I'd actually even argue against redistribution being ""zero-sum"" in any meaningful sense. From a utilitarian perspective, it's arguably positive-sum so long as we accept that the utility curve of material wealth is concave.)",1217870422

266475,comment,266101,266117,0,0,kcl,,,">Why should I learn this language that I've never heard of if it can't even do math in any sensible way? Not left-to-right, not order of operations, not lisp-like prefix. Who thought that was a good idea?<p>Of the three choices you mention only one makes sense as an alternative: left-to-right instead of right-to-left.<p>Order of operations, as it turns out, has nothing at all to do with real computation (in the same way that pi really should have been defined as 2pi). Most educated people, after a moment of reflection, should agree with this statement. Getting rid of order of operations makes the parsing process simpler, both for the compiler and for your head. If order of operations wasn't so ingrained in your head there would be no reason at all to use it. K makes a lot of design decisions like these: doing what's right at the expense of what's common.<p>I'm not sure where order of operations came from, probably as a nicety for mathematicians dealing with complicated polynomials, but when computers came about it must've been clear that it was the wrong way to do things.<p>Here's a code snippet that makes order of operations look just as silly:<p><pre><code>  a*b+c%d%e+f*g^h*i*j*k-l / ugly with order of operations, hidden levels of complexity
</code></pre>
Lisp prefix form, from a mathematical point of view, certainly makes more sense than order of operations. The reason it isn't used in K is, for one, K is inline, and two, Lisp syntax demands a lot more written code than K, and this goes against the philosophy of K. K wants to create the shortest programs in the shortest amount of time.<p>For example, something that is perfectly natural in K<p><pre><code>  2+7%3*2+5 / k, 9 characters - 1 level deep
</code></pre>
looks ridiculous in Lisp<p><pre><code>  (+ 2 (% 7 (* 3 (+ 2 5))))
  ;Lisp, 25 characters - 8 spaces, 8 parentheses, 4 levels deep
  ;Two parentheses and one level of nesting for each operation
</code></pre>
for the reason that Lisp is not as rabid about brevity as K is. (And how could it be. K is a much newer language.)<p>This leaves left-to-right evaluation. One argument against left-to-right evaluation is the following code:<p><pre><code>  f g
</code></pre>
where f is any function. For instance<p><pre><code>   g:3
   f:{1+x}
 
   f f g 
  5
</code></pre>
and so on. But this presumes that you accept two axioms (1. you should read left-to-right as in English 2. functions should precede operands). I am currently of the opinion that left-to-right evaluation is better given a left-to-right read order<p><pre><code>  g f f / 5, fictional example
</code></pre>
because I've yet to discover sound reasoning why mathematicians believe the function should precede the operand. (The answer may be that there isn't a reason, and mathematicians did it that way only because they never cared enough to pay close attention to syntax. Or perhaps it's because written mathematics ""executes"" in English, and not in an interpreter.)<p>The language designer has defended right-to-left evaluation with the following statements. ""Why right-to-left?""<p><pre><code>  so that it reads left to right.
  note k executes left of right, e.g. syracuse operation: 1+3*
  the basic math notation is:
  f g h x
  executes right to left but reads
  f of g of h of x
</code></pre>
I remain unconvinced, especially since there are benefits to left-to-right execution (presuming left-to-right read order) including on-the-fly processing. It just seems more natural to me, mathematically, though I admit it would be very unnatural for me to write in such a way.<p>K is a beautiful language with a lot of nice features. Anything truly innovative is going to look new and different, and in K you get the statement<p><pre><code>  3*2+5 / yields 21
</code></pre>
There are a lot of unusual looking things in K. There are also lots of very powerful ones. But these won't reveal themselves until you spend a time looking at the language. So my suggestion is if you are intrigued by the powerful stuff, keep looking, and don't be turned off by the strangeness of the simple stuff. In some cases you may find that your opinion changes on how things should be done. There is a lot of wisdom hidden in K.",1217870303

If you want a password check to take one full second, you can do that. A dictionary attack against one six-character password on that system, even offline against a captured hash, would take years.",1217869370

I'll need to talk things over with the other person that has become involved in the project, because even though it's more-or-less my baby, I don't want him to feel that his work is just going to go towards making money for me.<p>I think mechanical_fish may be right, in that I've been thinking of my time as cheap, which is strikingly uncharacteristic for me.  It is true that I've put a shocking amount of time into this, when I could have been doing something to earn an income, so perhaps it isn't so unreasonable to try and get a bit of cash out of the process.<p>Thanks!<p>Also, I like the 'semester' and 'lifetime' pricing models.  The lifetime subscription model appeals most to me, as most language students seem to fade out after two years.  So, if I base my pricing on that assumption, the application should be able to cover its costs, and for those who stick around longer, it'll just be a little reward for their hard work.<p>callosum: An email is on its way.<p>queensnake: Unfortunately, while I could write the application itself in Python, the supporting libraries are not readily portable, and neither are the bits of C glue that I've had to write to link everything together.  So, AppEngine is out.",1217869219

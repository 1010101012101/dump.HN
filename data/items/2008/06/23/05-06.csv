I've been having trouble getting much traction going at my teams weekly meetings ...""</i><p>Probably because they realise that you get paid just as much in meetings as coding except meetings are a whole lot easier. How many people do you have? (4) Are they all in the same room. If they are all in the same room and your team is small you don't need <i>""formal""</i> meetings.

Took me a few hours to get the hang of it and then I was able to create a simple tracking application for my simple needs. There are sample templates included but they were overly complex and not what I needed.<p>What really impresses me about it is how easy it is to make your setup as simple or as complex as your needs are.

We figured the time devoted to organizing our priorities would help us out in the long run.<p>Our to-do tracking is separated into three lists: monthly, weekly, and daily. At the start of each month we list the items we want to accomplish. Next, at the beginning of each week, we transfer items from our monthly to-do list to our weekly to-do list. Then at the start of each day, we take on tasks from our weekly to-do list and aim to accomplish it by the end of the day. Random tasks will obviously come up so we add it to the appropriate list.<p>Another advantage to our system is that we're able to see eachothers' lists so everyone is held accountable -- if someone is slacking, we'll tell them. A SMS alert is also sent to the person's phone if their last login is greater than 24 hours.",1214199587
224819,comment,224695,224695,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"There's a lot of hindsight there, even in the first few paragraphs. For example, the monetary inflation of the 20th century wouldn't have been obvious to someone living in 1884 right after the monetary tightening accompanying the resumption of the gold standard. Inflation occurs in societies that debase their currency or that discover large new sources of whatever commodity their currency is backed by. It is far from a universal occurrence. Constant inflation did not occur in the United States until after the FDR presidency when we adopted a fiat currency standard. Making a company worth $2 trillion 1884 dollars is much harder than making a company worth $2 trillion of today's dollars or of 1865 dollars.<p>Couldn't bring myself to finish.

224810,comment,224407,224407,0,0,pjackson,,,"I won't comment on the design concerns. Many people have done that and I could swing either way on your choice of implementation strategies. Instead, I'd like to comment solely on the code.<p>As an agilist, I'd say: ""The code works, so it adds business value, and therefore the rest doesn't matter."" However, I am not solely an agilist. I believe this code is too hard to maintain.<p>This code is terse, which is often good. However, it is also too clever for me to follow in a few minutes. It's a library function, so there isn't much to gain from being terse or clever.<p>You could do one of several things, but here are the two I'd consider:<p>1. Keep the logic the way it is, and attempt to use formatting and commenting to make it easier to follow. Use more vertical lines and maybe use sidebar commenting to make each line clear in its intent.<p>2. Follow the advice of the folks who say that you're not really saving compiler time and unroll the logic into more definitive chunks that use variables to illustrate what you're up to.<p>In this case, I prefer #2, because I suspect you may have put more effort into writing fewer lines than you may have been able to put into a solution that used more lines. If you consider the cost-per-line-of-code, you may not have saved anything.<p>That said, congratulations. You may want to consider entering an obfuscated code content. :) (Just kidding).",1214198695

224800,comment,224615,224615,0,0,icey,,,"Hmm. You're getting some... strange advice in this thread.<p>First: A scheduled weekly meeting with you and three other people is most likely overkill. The only reason to have scheduled meetings with that frequency is if you are dealing with a large team with conflicting schedules. What do you do in these meetings? I hope it's not a status report meeting. I would certainly hope in that small a team you already know the status before even starting the meeting.<p>Always ask yourself ""can this be solved with an email or a phone call"" before calling a meeting. People resent having their time spent by their boss catching up.<p>Don't be afraid to grab two people and say ""hey guys, we need to hash this out"". If you feel that it's going to take more than 20 minutes or so, THEN schedule a meeting.<p>Try not to schedule meetings too far out in advance. Having a meeting scheduled 5 days out kills productivity. Nobody will want to make a decision because it will be talked about ""in the meeting"".<p>Something that I see a ton of in startups is the perceived need for formality. In a team of 4, I would assume you have other responsibilities than managing the rest of your team. If not, then I assume you're the money guy. Either way, be very careful of destroying your team's productivity because you're looking for a way to validate your position. You don't have to do that, I assume they already understand you're the CEO.<p>I can tell people have done a lot of reading about how other companies do their meetings; unfortunately none of it is good advice. You know your team and we don't. You know your product and we don't. If meetings seem boring, then you probably shouldn't have had one. If people can't keep in the loop with what's going on in the company, then you need more meetings.<p>Anyways, let's get to a TLDR version:<p>- Don't have a meeting without a clear reason for having one.<p>- That reason has to pass the ""can this be solved by an email or phone call"" litmus test.<p>- Don't waste people's time.",1214197911

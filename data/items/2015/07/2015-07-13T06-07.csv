9876774,comment,9875346,9875492,0,0,Jemaclus,,,"> Most of the start-up crowd seems to think that it&#x27;s worth paying several times more rent to be physically near the big money in SanFran.<p>It&#x27;s not an unfounded belief, imo. I&#x27;ve been trying to convince several of my friends to move to San Francisco, and the &quot;it&#x27;s too expensive&quot; refrain is something I&#x27;m getting a little tired of hearing. Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but in general, the salary and other income opportunities make it worth it for a decent software engineer.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much the cost of living is in Montana, but I&#x27;m from Alabama, and I assume it&#x27;s relatively comparable, and I had a 40K/year job there. My rent was $500/mo. I&#x27;d say my monthly expenses were a little less than $1600/mo, which puts my annual expenses at around 20K. Over the last five years in SF, my annual expenses approached 60K, mostly toward rent (like you said, rent is high). Whoa. That&#x27;s crazy, right? But let&#x27;s stop and do the math.<p>Let&#x27;s throw out a nice round number and say my average income over those first few years in SF was ~120K and say 30% tax rate, to keep things simple. In San Francisco, 120K (income) - 60K (expenses) - 36K taxes = <i></i>24K savings<i></i>. In Alabama, 40K (income) - 20K (expenses) - 12K (taxes) = <i></i>8K savings<i></i>.<p>My expenses in Alabama were 1/3 that of SF -- the rent was almost 6 times cheaper in Alabama than my rent in SF is! But in San Francisco, my increased salary means that I&#x27;m saving three times as much in San Francisco versus Alabama. My cost of living in SF is 3x higher than my cost of living in San Francisco -- but my income is also 3x higher! And I&#x27;m not even included income from stock or freelance work. (Granted, I could get stock and freelance work elsewhere, but again, like you said, &quot;the big money&quot; is in SF, so roughly the same math would apply.)<p>All this is to say that, assuming you enjoy living in an urban environment and are responsible with your money, it IS worth paying several times more rent to be physically near the big money in SF. <i></i>A dollar is a dollar anywhere in the United States.<i></i> Saving 24K per year for 5 years gets you awfully close to 125K, well on your way to a nice house pretty much anywhere else in the country - Montana included. It would take you over twice that long to get to even 100K if you lived in Alabama.<p>Is it worth paying a high rent to enjoy the benefits of living in SF? I think so. I love SF -- the city, the culture, the weather, the working environment, and yes, the money. There are times when I wish I had a bigger house, but by and large, I&#x27;m extremely happy here.<p>But more to OP&#x27;s point: Would I move to Montana? I agree with you. There would have to be really, really attractive incentives aside from money. Great schools, great entertainment, friends, family, and plenty of job opportunities. Solid infrastructure is a must, but my day job isn&#x27;t my identity -- there are another 12-18 hours in a day that command my time and energy as well, and those needs must be met!",1436770561
9876773,comment,9876009,9876141,0,0,davidm888,,,"There are a number of comments saying things like, &quot;get them to accept the check on the spot,&quot; &quot;entice them to sign the severance agreement quickly,&quot; &quot;make sure they sign it fast before they change their minds and get a lawyer,&quot; etc.  This is bad advice.<p>It is true that you should get them to sign an agreement that contains, among other things, a &quot;general release&quot; that basically says that they promise not to sue you for any reason.  It is also true that to be enforceable, you must give something of value (i.e., &quot;legal consideration&quot;), and the severance pay is usually the principal consideration for such an agreement.<p>I would be extremely cautious, however, about getting someone to sign quickly.  It seems to make sense on the face of it (get them to sign away their right to sue before they contemplate getting an attorney). But there is a flip side that no one is mentioning.  If you shock someone by calling them into your office and telling that they&#x27;re losing their job, put a legal document in front of them that they probably won&#x27;t completely understand (it&#x27;s going to have a laundry-list of statutory provisions that they need to expressly waive), put a check in front of them and say &quot;here, sign this now!&quot; you&#x27;re going to unnecessarily jeopardize the enforceability of the release.  The ex-employee&#x27;s lawyer will argue that it was signed under duress and without sufficient knowledge, understanding and consent to constitute a valid waiver of the right to pursue certain claims.<p>Also, depending on the worker&#x27;s age, there might be additional complications.  The Older Worker&#x27;s Benefit Protection Act applies to employees over 40, and requires the terminated employee be given 21 days to consider the release and 7 days afterward to change their mind. (The 21 days increases to 45 if there are two or more employees being terminated.)  Although this particular statutory requirement doesn&#x27;t apply to those under 40, it underscores the notion that allowing someone to consider a severance agreement for some amount of time and have the opportunity to discuss it with their own attorney if desired are both good things when it comes to enforcing the agreement.  How long you give them is a matter of balancing numerous statutory and common law considerations (both state and federal) with the goal of getting them to sign quickly, and there are avenues, regardless of age, for their attorney to attack the validity of the release if they sign it without properly understanding and consenting to its terms.<p>I should also point out that severance agreements should always be prepared by an attorney.  There are numerous considerations that vary state-to-state; there are specific waivers that need to be contained in them; there are different rules depending on the number of employees; possible notice requirements (in which case the severance might be designated as compensation in lieu thereof); rules about timing of final payments; whether or not benefits are paid out; etc.",1436770560

Prices can soar to many multiples of their values, and selling short will bankrupt almost everyone who thinks they know, for certain, when the party will stop.<p>Every once in a while a few economists stake their reputation on a market crash and are correct, and sometimes they get a little too full of themselves, write a book on their ability to forecast the market, and disappear into obscurity. Michael Pettis seems he may very well be one of these people.<p>Just about every economist I&#x27;ve read has thought the party would stop in China soon, no nation can sustain growth rates like theirs indefinitely.

One of the engineers found a home at a startup that was backed by the same VC. Eventually as the first startup went under, he laid the ground work for some of us to transition over to his dev team.",1436767292

It is all well and fine to go through life assuming that all people are good, honorable, ethical and even altruistic.  Yet, it is even better to believe those things while taking steps towards protecting yourself and your company should you come across someone who deviates from such notions.<p>Why do I say this?  Because I&#x27;ve been burned on more than one occasion by people who see a layoff as an opportunity to enrich themselves.  If you don&#x27;t know how to manage a layoff it is very likely that you will do and say things that will expose you and your company to liability.  This is the part that sucks.  You have to lawyer-up in order not to create a problem for yourself or your business.  There are Federal and State laws you have to be aware of.<p>Spend a few hundred dollars to sit down with an attorney well versed in matters surrounding labor law and have him/her advise you on how to conduct the layoffs.",1436767200

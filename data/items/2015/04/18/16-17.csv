Same reason for the loudness war in music. The audio is mastered to sound good on bad speakers. It&#x27;s more dramatic / noticeable in ads because you&#x27;re watching a bunch of spots run back-to-back in a a relatively short period of time. The content of the ads are produced to be more attention grabbing and clearly define the start/end of each spot. IMO trying to regulate something like this is pointless.

9400080,comment,9396950,9399206,0,0,haberman,,,"> One thing that people advocating FDO often forget: this is statically tuning the code for a specific use case.<p>Yes, I meant to mention this but forgot.  The numbers I posted are a best-case example for FDO, because the FDO is specific to the one benchmark I&#x27;m testing.<p>> Ok, so feed it with a huge mix of benchmarks that simulate typical usage. But then the profile gets flatter and FDO becomes much less effective.<p>True, though I think one clear win with FDO is helping the compiler tell fast-paths from slow-paths in each opcode.  I would expect this distinction to be relatively universal regardless of workload.<p>The theory of fast-path/slow-path optimization would say that fast-paths are much more common than slow-paths.  Otherwise optimizing fast-paths would be useless because slow-paths would dominate.<p>The fact that a compiler can&#x27;t statically tell a fast-path from a slow-path is a big weakness.  FDO does seem like it should be able to help mitigate that weakness.",1429376080

I think the reality has changed too.<p>Since the days when we used to walk five miles to the toy store, everyone has better access to technology, transportation, and information, than they did, and this is a double edged sword that enables both good and bad people to have more capabilities.<p>Also not just perception is the fact that Reagan defunded mental health treatment, leading to the massive homeless situation we have (I&#x27;m not saying homeless people or mentally ill people are necessarily dangerous, but as with any unknown variable, their presence does make it harder to determine when a place is safe or not).<p>Still, in this particular case it seems like the police went way over a line of reasonableness... maybe not in picking the kids up, but in what happened next.",1429375991

There is literally nothing that film cameras can do that digital camera&#x27;s can&#x27;t do, and in most cases do better. Comparing the transition to painting versus photography is just ridiculous - you might as well compare painting to sculpture, because they are <i>genuinely</i> different art forms. 3D printing and sculpting are completely different processes to produce a 3D shape - film and digital photography are two almost identical processes to produce the same end result. I don&#x27;t see a single argument in favour of film besides nostalgia.

It&#x27;s much much cheaper to get an extremely high resolution photograph on film. Medium format is something like 100 megapixels, and it costs about a dollar per shot after initial expenses. The higher resolution might not matter on monitors, but it makes a huge difference in size limitations and sharpness when printed, and prints are generally the goal for artists.<p>True large format like 4x5 costs something like $10 a shot depending what film you use (I&#x27;ve heard it can cost a lot less if you shoot cheapo medical b&w), but has insane resolution, measured in gigapixels. You can print it wall-sized, no problem. On top of that, you can only perform the full range of movements such as tilt shift and correcting for some types of perspective distortion on a large format field camera.<p>This stuff does not matter for photojournalist or weddings or sports, but many professional artists still choose film. They never really stopped. This is in contrast to DJs, the largest supporters of vinyl through the 90s and 00s, who seem to have mostly stopped spinning vinyl unless they&#x27;re scratching.<p>As a hobbyist, I appreciate that film makes me think more about each shot. I hate the immediate feedback of digital. I love film&#x27;s tactile nature. I love turning off the screen and hitting the darkroom.

Now granted when I was these kid&#x27;s age it was the mid-70s to early 80s, but still from the time I was in kindergarten I walked to/from school about a mile each way every day regardless of whether it was sunny, rainy, snowing, whatever. After school I walked through our community to go to friend&#x27;s houses at the ripe old age of 5 or 6. And on the weekends, kids of all ages were found running around the community from sunrise to sunset. Our parents trusted us and the other members of the community.<p>Yet while our parents were letting us do this just around the corner one of the most notorious abductions in the area took place (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_sisters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon_sisters</a>). So you can&#x27;t tell me that there were not predators around at that time.<p>IMO, the difference was that instead of calling the police on kids that seemed lost, most parents in the community would ask the kids if they needed help. I don&#x27;t know where or how the shift occurred, but today it seems we live in a society where everyone wants to pass blame and cares only about themselves.<p>I have two theories why this is occurring. First, the media of today is much different than the past. Today, it seems to me at least, the media has a bad habit of over-sensationalizing every story to pit two sides against one another. This story in particular has created such a havoc in this neighborhood that these kids, and their parents, will never live a &quot;normal&quot; life in that community again. The media has stirred the pot so much that there are now lone individuals that don&#x27;t agree with these parents that are going to target this family every time they see something they don&#x27;t like.<p>My second theory is that we live in a society now where people are afraid of their own shadows at times. When I was about 7 or 8 I was skateboarding down a street a couple blocks from my house. I fell and cut my chin wide open requiring stitches. I started crying and walking home. In that time I must have had 4 or 5 different people come up to me to ask if I was alright with one finally giving me a ride home. I believe if this same situation happened today those 4-5 people would have probably just called 911 instead of trying to get involved and help me. They would have done this out of fear of being sued for not helping better. Or sadly there are those individuals in the community now who will label that person as a predator just for helping.<p>Where I live now is a small town where everyone that lives here knows everyone. Kids of all ages run up and down the street at all hours of the day in the summer. We have a strong local police force that is always actively community policing and knows everyone that lives in the community. On the other hand it is a tourist town and during the summer the population swells drastically (we go from about 300 residents to well over 10,000), yet nothing changes. People look out for each other. More importantly, we also don&#x27;t have any local major media outlets that report regularly on news in our area. And because it is a resort area where there is fear if bad things are reported it will drive tourism away, the media doesn&#x27;t tend to report on all that occurs. Yet nothing bad happens that is out of the ordinary. I mean we have our increased bar fights, DUIs, thefts, and on occasion there has been a murder, but still I can wake up on a nice day and hear kids running around the street playing. No one calls the police on other people&#x27;s kids. Even high school house parties go unreported as long as the kids don&#x27;t violate parking laws or destroy someone else&#x27;s property. And even if they do the party is usually just broken up, people sent on their way, and damages worked out between the parents.",1429374540

Some instructions in your CPU may be faster, but slower alternative often consume less total energy (even taking everything into account —there have been experiments and power measurements).  Even if it means your CPU is up a bit longer.  Then there are considerations that save energy, but don&#x27;t matter for speed at all, such as the width of integer operations: no need to go 32 bits wide or 64 bits wide, when no value exceeds 127.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not sure about current leakage exceeding the benefits of underclocking.  Those benefits are <i>massive</i>.  Lowering the frequency also means you can lower the voltage. In the talks I have seen, halving the speed of a core (and lowering the voltage accordingly) makes it dissipate about a <i>fourth</i> the power.  Half the energy, considering everything takes twice the time.  This of course ignores leakage, but I doubt it would counter such a strong effect.<p>Besides, with a phone running a number of background processes, I wonder how much power saving time you can get.

I&#x27;ve had a lot of experience with the professional photography world with my family, and for the most part, expectations about contract terms are largely the same. From studios shooting elementary school kids for their first yearbook photos all the way to large assignment shoots for multinationals, it&#x27;s understood that the photographer retains IP rights as the norm. Clients will sometimes purchase IP rights outright, but they&#x27;re going to pay to do so though it&#x27;s pretty rare (most photos for marketing projects, for instance, will only be used for the duration of particular campaigns).<p>I can&#x27;t really see the same model ever being used for development work. Off the top of my head, I can&#x27;t recall a single model contract for design or development I&#x27;ve read online that doesn&#x27;t include terms for the transfer of IP rights. When you&#x27;re designing an identity for a company, that identity will eventually become that company&#x27;s public face. No company on earth is going to play games there by letting a third-party have any form of control over it (and that&#x27;s exactly what licensing terms would be). Their legal department would kill any project before it began, solely out of concern for what you might do in the future.<p>Let&#x27;s say you decide to raise your licensing terms in the future based on the company&#x27;s growth as a brand. Or better yet, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re dead and now your estate controls things. How will that pan out? The same goes for code.  If you wrote a major component for FedEx&#x27;s logistics management, the sort of thing where other major components subsequently rely on it, what would happen if you decided to play games? You&#x27;d have effective control over their entire logistics systems, and that&#x27;s something that would terrify any corporate lawyer.<p>While I can appreciate the desire to look at alternative contract terms, licensing ala what professional photographers and artists use is something I think is DOA.",1429374069

What individuals have is mainly opinions about facts.<p>I don&#x27;t think talking about &quot;opinions&quot; is interesting. That word lumps so many things together that it doesn&#x27;t mean anything useful. People have facts, logic, assumptions and priorities. The last two aren&#x27;t objective. You can prove or disprove an assumption but it&#x27;s commonly expensive to do it, and until somebody does, it remains something that reasonable people can disagree about.<p>But the real trouble is priorities. Should we imprison an innocent man or let ten guilty people go free? The answer to that question has objective consequences but they aren&#x27;t uniformly distributed, so those more likely to be victims of criminals who go unpunished and those more likely to be innocent people falsely convicted will rationally prioritize different things without either of them being wrong in any objective sense. But that&#x27;s politics. People have to come to terms with each other without attacking each other or we end up in a civil war.<p>> I strongly believe it is <i>less</i> understanding. As a member of various dominant groups, my understanding of things like race and gender was very coarse. That&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t have to pay any attention to those things; they almost always worked in my favor. When that&#x27;s not the case, people are forced to pay more attention.<p>But now you&#x27;re talking about generalities when we&#x27;re dealing with individuals. Using the color of someone&#x27;s skin to make stereotypical assumptions about them is the thing we&#x27;re supposed to be doing away with. You can&#x27;t tell by looking at someone how much thought they&#x27;ve put into something.<p>And even if the stereotype is often correct, perspective is still a different axis than quantity. It is useful to know when and to what degree proposals will create a backlash and resentment that may do more harm than good, especially when there are less adversarial paths to the same result.<p>None of which addresses the original point in the article, which is that many of the statistics driving headlines (women are paid 77 cents on the dollar, one in six women are sexually assaulted) are misleading or false, and people have been unjustifiably attacked for pointing that out.<p>> I agree with that, but don&#x27;t see its relevance to the discussion. Could you say more?<p>The context of the discussion is that people are attacking speakers for saying true things inconvenient to the attackers&#x27; causes, even to the point of trying (and sometimes succeeding) to destroy their careers and reputations. Your counterargument seems to be that people have no obligation to listen to the speaker; but the speakers&#x27; complaint is not that they&#x27;re being ignored, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re being unjustifiably attacked.",1429373825

However, their access is pretty useless because they have no real way to extract the cash. ATMs have limits and require EMV cards which these hackers are unable to clone, and the only other way to get money out is a wire transfer .... to another heavily ID verified bank account. As they also can&#x27;t beat the ID verification of the banks, they find themselves with access to money they cannot steal.<p>Enter Bitcoin. They now have the perfect solution: pick a victim Bitcoin trader or exchange, and wire the money to them as part of an anonymous Bitcoin trade. As the trader doesn&#x27;t check IDs as well as banks do (or don&#x27;t try at all), the hacker gets the coins without being able to be traced. The bank now has a couple of choices, none of them good:<p>• They can roll back the transaction leaving the trader with the bill, but this may be forbidden by certain banking rules<p>• They can eat the loss and block the trader to ensure it doesn&#x27;t happen again<p>As rolling back transactions across banks is tricky and usually (always?) manual, eating the loss followed by account termination is usually the easiest path forward.<p>The solution is for local Bitcoin traders to do ID  verification as robustly as the banks do. For that to happen, traders need to be educated and the tools need to be written. Android phones can upload dumps of the e-Passport NFC chips which are digitally signed, so an e-Passport dump + Skype session is usually enough to verify a counterparty to a high degree of confidence (excluding things like stolen passports that the hacker buys because they look similar). But the tools to do this don&#x27;t really exist right now.",1429373471

It has extensive walking paths, sidewalks, crosswalks, lights, etc.<p>Any child is within an easy 10-15 minute walk to school, and there wouldn&#x27;t need to be more than 2 or 3 crossing guards to cover all the major roads and intersections. But this would be too easy, instead all the children line up at bus stops throughout the neighborhood, take a 5-10 minute bus-ride to their school and a 5-10 minute ride in the afternoon to get back home.<p>Parents who want to drop their kids off create chaos as hundreds of cars pack the areas around schools so they can drop-off their children. The local message boards are full of angry parents swearing at each other for driving poorly or violating some kind of unwritten rule during this drop-off/pick-up period. To say it&#x27;s chaos would by minimizing it.<p>My understanding is that no child walks to any of the schools, even if they live across the street. The consideration is that it&#x27;s too dangerous, with all the buses and cars and all. And there&#x27;s a couple largish roads with people who drive too fast.<p>So instead of a couple crossing guards, they&#x27;ve created an unsafe chaos, used millions of dollars worth of equipment and hired a dozen or more bus drivers to shuttle kids back and forth to school.<p>Of course once our pools are open, kids run around the entire neighborhood with complete abandon, dodging hi-speed traffic in flipflops as they frogger their way to their summer fun.<p>I remember when I was a young child I had about a mile-by-mile area in an urban area I could free-range within. It was naturally cut-off by some major roads, but provided more than enough area for me and my friends to play around in. On occasion, I&#x27;d walk to elementary school instead of taking the bus, 3 or 4 miles away. It wasn&#x27;t seen as a big deal.<p>When I was about 10 we moved to a rural area, and my local free-range zone exploded to a massive wooded zone full of animals, and creeks and rivers. My mother decided she wanted me to attend an after-school program across the street from my school. It was at an intersection with crosswalks and walk signals and everything. Things went well for the first couple weeks. Then one day, in great alarm, the principal of the school grabbed me before I left for the day and forbade me from crossing the street.<p>For the rest of the contract period with the after-school program, I had to call a taxi, wait 10-20 minute for him to show up, have him take me the 10 second drive across the street, pay the minimum fare (I think it was $5 at the time). Finally the taxi company even started complaining that this was stupid to the school, but my parents had had enough and pulled from the after school program and just let me take the bus home....where I happily walked a mile down a busy country dirt road from my bus stop to my house to put down my school stuff before heading off into the woods until it got dark.",1429373057

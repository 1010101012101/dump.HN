Frankly, what I saw was a mass of photos all of the same thing - various angles of the inside of a historic building.  I'm not sure how it added to the event or anyone's enjoyment of it.  I can see how Color could have some amazing applications, like forensic analysis of an event based on hundreds (if not thousands) of photos taken at and around the moment that something happened.  Think of what would be possible if Color had existed and was in heavy use on 11/22/63.",1302609348

2436765,comment,2436147,2436520,1,0,psykotic,,,"2 years is a good but somewhat arbitrary number. As you say, it depends on what you did in that time. At a smaller company, you can be productive almost instantly, allowing you to make major contributions in two years if you really push yourself. At a bigger company, you might spend the first six months just getting up to speed on their sprawling codebase before you can make any contributions. Even after that period, the inertia of politics and legacy code will still be slowing your pace. Two years at Microsoft circa 2010 isn't the same as two years at a fast-moving 20-person company.<p>So my advice is to make sure the first company you join is one where you can make big contributions right away. Kill yourself working that job. Don't worry too much about screwing up (you will in any case). Do it right and you'll be set on the right path for the rest of your career.",1302609293

Building a library is not innovative in and of itself, and there is nothing in linq's concepts or execution which is novel or innovative.<p>You seem to have taken an extremely defensive stance on my view that, apart from Kinect, none of the things mentioned is innovative. I guess that you disagree, do you have any argument as to why those things would be innovative (outside of a microsoft-driven world)? What makes LINQ innovative exactly? Or F#?",1302607719

You lose reputation for voting up at 1000 when it ends at -10.<p>Since judgement is subjective you need a bunch of moderators to seed the site with good judgement. Then so long as they over-ride votes on the most obvious examples it should be a self correcting reputation system.<p>I don't understand why in HN's current system voting power comes from karma which comes from occasional good posting. You could spend most of your time flaming, getting into arguments and down voting everyone you disagree with but so long as you're quick on posting PG's articles or write the occasional good comment HN views you as a model citizen.<p>Be interested in any critique of this as it's how ISDaily my news start-up works.

For example, holding Opt and clicking the WiFi icon in the menubar brings up the signal strength, IP address and other useful information. Likewise for the rest of the icons.<p>- In Spotlight, select an entry in the search results and hit Cmd+Return to go to its parent folder. Opt+Return opens results in a Finder window.<p>- You know you can drop files on dock icons? Did you know you can also drop them on the icons in the app switcher (the thing that comes up when you hit Cmd+Tab)?<p>- This one is a bitch to describe, but very useful. You know you can hit Cmd+M to iconify (""minimize"" in Windows-speak) applications to the Dock. But how do you get them back? Just do this: Cmd+Tab to the application, but don't release Cmd yet.

For example, the details of the propulsion system are probably off-limits.<p>There's a huge difference between being able to operate the systems on a complex aircraft (or spacecraft, in this case), and knowing the systems well enough to be able to handle emergencies effectively.  The former just requires you to have a basic understanding of which controls do what, the latter requires you to have a deep understanding of the guts (both hardware and software) behind the panel so that you can troubleshoot effectively.  To give one example, I would imagine that the details of space navigation systems are also off-limits (you could use such knowledge to build an ICBM guidance system), so you could teach people the basics of using the nav system on a space ship, but they would probably need security clearances before you could teach them how the nav system works under the hood.  Going back to the propulsion system example, you could give anybody a basic explanation of how it works, but security clearances would probably be required for the level of understanding a pilot would need in case of emergencies.<p>The main concern driving these restrictions is proliferation.  Just letting someone operate it is not a significant proliferation risk--you just have to vett the individual well enough to be sure he won't try to land it in Mexico.<p>Similarly, using it as a suicide weapon is also a minor concern because similar thorough vetting will weed out anyone inclined to deliberately crash it into a major population center.<p>Proliferation is much tougher to control, because once a foreign national returns to his home country, we have no recourse if he decides to start sharing what he learned.  It's easy to screen out people who would do extreme things like steal a space ship or use it as a suicide weapon, much harder to be sure that someone will keep unenforceable promises not to tell secrets.<p>The tour was arranged for a group of students, myself among them.

655839,comment,655541,655541,0,0,kiba,,,"I thought a game development business is alway a long term endevenor and that one should not expect great profits or huge crowd of roaring fans straight away.<p>Granted, I developed games for three years and have not seem to attracted any players. However, my games tend to suck because I have a tendancy to abandon projects as soon as I see new pasture ground. Coupled with no easy way to distribute my games, it is a killer.(Try making a window executable for your game written in a esortic programming language on a linux machine!)<p>However, I think I am onto something with my tetris-like game. 5th version of the game is supposed to be tommorow and I have not abandoned it yet. If only I can find an easy way to distribute my game to window users then I'll be golden.",1244869080

For Hacker News, the one-liner is <i>anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.</i> I guess what you have in mind is <i>anything that will foster interesting discussion about programming</i>?",1244869007

655836,comment,655723,655723,0,0,smwhreyebelong,,,"I think the community will auto-correct and weed out the reviewers who are not sincere. For example, if a user buys something based on Amazon reviews (of a Vine member, say), and discovers that the review was insincere, he/she will most likely go to Amazon and give a negative rating to the member/particular review, which will probably feed back into the Vine members reputation, which will in turn be used to determine eligibility for the Vine program.<p>Agreed that it'll take a while for the system to reach the critical mass, it is, nonetheless, a system that will work very well after it reaches the tipping point.",1244868843
655835,comment,655397,655624,0,0,gecko,,,"You can create these routes via ISAPI, but not via ASP.NET (i.e., writing your own .asxd and observe the same borked behavior)--hence why I know the bug's somewhere in ASP.NET proper.  You're correct that my post as-written is off, though.  I initially thought ASP.NET was hitting files even though I'd told it not to.  After more investigation, I think it's blocking those routes as a security feature to protect you in case you <i>at some point</i> turn file routing back on.",1244868815

I think they have managed that side of the business well, they are certainly better at monetrization than facebook. It's just the state of there platform that lets them down.",1244868520
655832,comment,655711,655819,0,0,jcapote,,,"Good question, I thought about those twice when compiling the list. The Hairy Ball theorem however did generate a great discussion on how it applies to game programming, so that's why I added it. As for the LSD article, while interesting, I didn't think that it was enough about code to matter. The key here isn't that we are trying to replace proggit and HN, but merely trying to organize the scope of the posts better (naturally there will be some overlap); So you should be able to still visit those sites for the lighter programming articles.",1244868505

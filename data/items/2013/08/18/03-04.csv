It has nothing to do with turning off the cameras of citizen-journalists.<p>(jwz nails it here: <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/08/oh-noes-apple-has-patented-big-brother/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/blog/2013/08/oh-noes-apple-has-patented-b...</a> )<p>Here is the full paragraph from which the misleading sentence was yanked:<p>> <i>Excessive lighting emanating from wireless devices can also create disruption in dark environments. While it is well known that excessive or bright lighting in a movie theater can spoil the mood of certain movies, excessive lighting can also become a more serious issue in other contexts. For example, darkrooms used to develop film can only tolerate very low amounts of ambient lighting. Some biological labs also require low levels of lighting in certain instances (for example, as in the growth of light-sensitive bacteria).</i> Covert police or government operations may require complete blackout conditions. <i>A person&#x27;s sleep can even be interrupted by a bright flashing or modulating display (such as to indicate an incoming call).</i>",1376798053

6231556,comment,6229911,6230515,3,0,fitumpich,,," I understand you don&#x27;t trust the NSA, but the viability of what it takes to make a bomb is just basic well understood physics.  There&#x27;s no conspiracy there.  You either have enough mass, at a higher enough level of enrichment and you can force them to go critical or you can&#x27;t.  For Uranium you need over 100lbs to build a basic gun type bomd, what&#x27;s terrifying is how little Plutonium you need.  The Fat Man bomb needed just over 6 kg of Pu.  So a little less than 14 pounds, and that was with 1940s grade material.  The USSR got pretty good at making good quality Pu.<p>The trick to keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of someone is the security of the material, its hard to enrich.  Its not hard to build the bomb.  Enrichment is really really really hard.  And its currently impossible to hide that your enriching.  So you basically secure the material, and look out for people trying to make it.  Thats how all non-proliferation works.<p>Nothings hard about the know how, everything you need to know is in the public domain.  And dont forget, pure fission bomds are 1940s tech.<p>It&#x27;s not a big secret how to build a simple gun type bomb.  You don&#x27;t need much precision for that.  You get enough HEU, and it&#x27;s game on.  You get the right shaped Pu and a few other items, and you have an even higher yield bomb than that of the HEU bomb.  Again, 1940s technology is all you need.<p>Fusion bombs, yes much harder.  But who needs that when you can build a Nagasaki yield bomb?",1376797505

FWIW, in contrast, I&#x27;m more of a &quot;connectionist&quot; [1]. This means that when I look at the same incredible &quot;general intelligence&quot; of humans -- this almost &quot;synesthetic&quot; ability to abstract and connect ideas -- I do not see a powerful translation and symbolic reasoning machine with some seemingly magical universal language buried deep within. In fact, I believe there can be no such language without severely compromising the reasoning system&#x27;s generality.<p>Instead, I see a powerful &quot;connection machine&quot;, where concepts, thoughts, language, etc. are all the result of some incredibly versatile connective learning/creativity process. Of particular importance, I see this connection machine thrive and prosper within systems where there are no axioms, no ground truth, no single agreed-upon notion of what separates &quot;this&quot; from &quot;that&quot; (you&#x27;ll see this in humans when studying philosophy). The analogy to this notion from a computationalist perspective would be a machine whose instruction set, or core reasoning language, is always in a state of flux.<p>I will freely admit though that one view does not necessarily have any more explanatory power than the other; they both rely on some &quot;magic&quot; unknown assumptions. For a connectionist, the &quot;magic&quot; is the connective learning algorithm. For a computationalist, the &quot;magic&quot; is in this universal language/symbolic system.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m by no means an AI expert (still have a lot more to learn!), but I always enjoy thinking/discussing these topics and the surrounding philosophy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism</a>",1376796963

6231462,comment,6228297,6229525,1,0,jameshart,,,"His examples only close over parameter variables and lifted functions, not local variables that actually, you know, vary.<p>The fact is, in JavaScript, lifted functions can close over local variables but the fact that they do is not obvious - in fact it&#x27;s so counterintuitive that you&#x27;re generally best to avoid doing so.<p>In the first example he gives, two functions that, in the original, are nested, in the refactoring are placed in the same scope, rather than nested within one another. His amended solution prevents the second function from closing over the scope of the first, which is possible in the original, or an async form. If you wanted to share state from the first function to the second, you&#x27;d have to realize you <i>could</i> bring the second function into the scope of the first, and then move it, and then you&#x27;re back where you started with nested callbacks. But amending this code is made harder than it should be by the decision to factor the two closures out to the widest possible scope, rather than the narrowest.<p>And the fact that ctrl-F closure yields no results just confirms the feeling that the examples gave me that the author is playing around with closures without knowing what he&#x27;s actually doing.",1376795258

6231460,comment,6230355,6230714,1,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Budgeting and launch costs are probably the biggest reasons.<p>Kepler, for example, has already used up its budget to build, launch, and operate the telescope for several years. Even if free replacement hardware was available there may not be enough money to launch it. Also, the way most spacecraft are built is as one off prototypes, so building another copy, even if all the spare parts were available, is a very non-trivial endeavor. Even if it didn&#x27;t take as long as building the original it would still be fairly expensive just to go through all of the necessary testing and integration steps.<p>The end result of all of this is that it rarely makes sense to spend the time and money to refly a spacecraft and instead it usually makes more sense to simply forge ahead and seek funding for a follow-on mission of a new design.<p>Here&#x27;s a few case studies. The inaugural launch of the Ariane 5 rocket failed, which resulted in the loss of 4 &quot;Cluster&quot; spacecraft which were designed to study Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere (a loss of about $370 million in hardware). However, ESA decided to fund replacements and they built 4 new satellites, making use of flight spares and extra hardware to save on costs, and then launched the new satellites on 2 separate Soyuz-Fregat flights. However, it still cost almost as much money to launch Cluster II as for the originals, so this was a rather heroic effort on ESA&#x27;s part.<p>In 1999 the Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WIRE) spacecraft was launched, shortly after launch there was a malfunction that caused a loss of the main science instrument on the orbital telescope. The mission was not replaced. However, the loss of WIRE caused other IR survey mission proposals to receive greater interest, which led to the funding of the &quot;Next Generation Sky Survey&quot; Medium-class Explorer mission. This infrared full-sky survey mission was launched in 2009 (as WISE, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) and achieved all of the science goals of the original WIRE mission.<p>In 1993 all contact was lost with the Mars Observer spacecraft right at the moment of planned orbital insertion. This loss led to a re-evaluation of the unmanned Mars exploration program at NASA and eventually led to around 10 new missions to Mars over the following 2 decades, most of them successful.",1376795232

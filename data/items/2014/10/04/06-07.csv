Angular momentum in the system is conserved; as you move mass up the space elevator, the earth spins (imperceptibly) slower.<p>Note that the tether only moves at orbital velocity at one point.

8408973,comment,8407298,8408399,2,0,lgeek,,,"I don&#x27;t see FPGA acceleration being useful in mainstream computers soon. By the way, AFAIK the one in Novena is primarily intended for data acquisition, not acceleration.<p>FPGAs are generally good for accelerating data-parallel applications, but we already have had SIMD and GPGPU for a while. Both these technologies are only used by a small subset of the applications which could benefit from employing them. Why? I would say poor tools and abysmal programmer literacy. Automatic vectorization for SIMD sort of works, but it tends to miss lots of opportunities. Automatic acceleration with GPGPU is pretty much in the research phase. Manual development for SIMD and GPGPU takes skills that most developers don&#x27;t seem to have at the moment and the trend towards high level, highly abstracted imperative languages isn&#x27;t helping.<p>I guess at this point it might seem like I&#x27;m contradicting myself. The software side of things is lagging behind for GPGPU and SIMD, but these technologies are still mainstream. Why wouldn&#x27;t the same happen for FPGA accelerators? My answer is cost. SIMD requires just a few small functional units and registers, a fairly small chip area in the processor compared to caches; the general purpose processor is itself a fairly small part of a SoC. GPGPU didn&#x27;t require significant architectural changes from the shader model. FPGAs large enough to be useful, on the other hand, are expensive. Maybe economies of scale might make a smaller FPGA cheap enough to be included as an accelerator, but as far as I understand high transistor count / large area / low yield is unavoidable.<p>Plenty of exciting stuff going in research, but automatic use of accelerators would work much better by moving to a dataflow model of programming.<p>Personal prediction: non-monotonic same-ISA heterogeneous computing is going to be the next big thing, maybe in the form of reconfigurable pipelines. A bit more far fetched: phase-change materials for very aggressive short-term DVFS to lower latency on mobile.",1412405900

You would lower a tether from geosynchronous orbit, and simultaneously extend a tether into space. Thus, the total mass stays centered in geosynchronous orbit, and the lower tether gets pulled towards earth because of gravity, whole the upper tether gets pulled away because of centrifugal forces.<p>Thus, in the end, you have a tether that lightly touches the ground without force and stays in the same place, and an outer tether that extends about a third of the way out to the moon. The tensile forces would be strongest in geosynchronous orbit and weakest at the ends of the tether.<p>Another benefit of this construction is that you can use the outer tether to launch spaceships into space at escape velocity without any need for propulsion. You can even use tethers on other planets to catch such payloads again.<p>This construction does not eliminate the need for propulsion to reach orbit.

You really don&#x27;t sacrifice anything by using it.<p>> the abilitity to write print statements to do debugging<p>I can slap a `trace` statement wherever the fuck I want inside my Haskell code for debugging. Even inside a pure function, no IO monad required. If I want to add a logger to my code, a &#x27;Writer&#x27; monad is almost completely transparent, or I can cheat and use unsafePerformIO.<p>> and lose the ability to reason about order of execution.<p>If I&#x27;m writing pure code, then order of execution is irrelevant. It simply does not matter. If I&#x27;m writing impure code, then I encode order of execution by writing imperative (looking) code using do-notation, and it looks and works just like it would in any imperative language.<p>> But does it really result in more performant code<p>Haskell has really surprised me with its performance. I&#x27;ve only really been using it for a short time, having been on the Java bandwagon for a long time.<p>One example I had recently involved loading some data from disk, doing some transforms, and spitting out a summary. For shits and giggles, we wrote a few different implementations to compare.<p>Haskell won, even beating the reference &#x27;C&#x27; implementation that we thought would have been the benchmark with which to measure everything else, and the Java version we thought we&#x27;d be using in production.<p>Turns out that laziness, immutability, and referential transparency really helped this particular case.<p>- Laziness meant that a naively written algorithm was able to stream the data from disk and process it concurrently without blocking. Other implementations had separate buffer and process steps (Even if hidden behind BufferedInputStream) that blocked the CPU while loading the next batch of data<p>- Immutability meant that the Haskell version could extract sections of the buffer for processing just by returning a new ByteString pointer. Other versions needed to copy the entire section into a new buffer, wasting CPU cycles, memory bandwidth, and cache locality.<p>- Referential transparency meant that we could trivially run this over multiple cores without additional work.<p>Naturally, a hand-crafted C version would almost certainly be faster than this - but it would have required a lot more effort and a more complex algorithm to do the same thing. (Explicit multi-threading, a non-standard string library, and a lot of juggling to keep the CPU fed with just the right amount of buffer).<p>On a per-effort basis, Haskell (From my minimal experience) seems to be one of the more performant languages I&#x27;ve ever used. (That is to say, for a given amount of time and effort, Haskell seems to punch well above its weight. At least for the few things I&#x27;ve used it for so far).<p>I&#x27;m still of the impression that well written C (or Java) will thoroughly trounce Haskell overall, but GHC will really surprise you sometimes.<p>I haven&#x27;t used OCaml much - but my understanding is that the GIL makes it quite difficult to write performant multi-threaded code, something that Haskell makes almost effortless.",1412403204

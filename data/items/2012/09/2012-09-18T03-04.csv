4536236,comment,4534359,4535149,2,0,stryker,,,"I feel like a lot of people here misunderstand the speed of light as a cosmic speed limit. The speed of light as a speed limit is a <i>local</i> constraint. On a larger scale there is no such speed limit. Just because you travel faster than light on a non-local scale does not mean you break causality.<p>For example, light ""travels"" more slowly through water than vacuum. Well, actually, photons travel at <i>c</i> always -- it's just that light gets bounced around by water molecules, getting absorbed and reabsorbed many many times before arriving at the destination. It's like driving to a destination as opposed to running to it. If the roads are curvy enough, the runner will win because he is not constrained by roads. Could it be that the Alcubierre drive gets past the roads of empty space in a way light cannot?<p>For a better example, consider the expansion of the universe. Link: <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575</a>. I quote:<p><i>The fact that galaxies we see now are moving away from us faster than the speed of light has some bleak consequences, however. Astronomers now have strong evidence that we live in an ""accelerating universe,"" which means that the speed of each individual galaxy with respect to us will increase as time goes on. If we assume that this acceleration continues indefinitely, then galaxies which are currently moving away from us faster than the speed of light will always be moving away from us faster than the speed of light and will eventually reach a point where the space between us and them is stretching so rapidly that any light they emit after that point will never be able to reach us.</i><p>In other words, vacuum fills in between us and far away galaxies faster than light can traverse it. Again, locally, the derivative of position with respect to time is <i>c</i>, but the universe is able to ""cheat"" by messing around with the definition of position. If the Alcubierre drive messes with the fabric of the universe in a similar way, I don't see any reason why it cannot succeed.<p>Here's a related link: <a href=""http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=56"" rel=""nofollow"">http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=56</a>. I quote:<p><i>Technically speaking, the speed of light limit only applies when you are in an ""inertial frame"" -- that is, sitting where you are, without any forces acting on you, and measuring the speed of an object that moves past a ruler and clock that you are holding in your hand. Across the large distances in the universe, however, we have a very different set of circumstances. No one is in an inertial frame, because everyone is being accelerated with respect to everyone else, due to the universe's gravitational field and the fact that the universe is expanding. In effect, the universe's expansion isn't really due to galaxies moving ""through space"" away from each other, but rather due to the stretching of space itself, which isn't governed by the same limits that we are.</i><p>I'm not sure whether the Alcubierre drive contradicts causality, but if it does, I highly doubt that it is because of the arguments presented on this forum.",1347940417

I hope I can convince my girlfriend to go with an alternative, but this is likely a battle that I will lose.<p>The issue centres around the social stigma of not having a diamond ring. Friends and family will ask what the stone is, and need to be educated. And no matter what you tell them, the perception will be that I was too cheap to buy her a real engagement ring. Nevermind the fact that I'm not actually saving any money, I'm just spending it <i>somewhat</i> more wisely.<p>It's actually a little bit of a stressful situation for me. I'm in the Royal Canadian Mint's MintChip Challenge, and I'm hoping to win some gold from the competition, so I can melt it down and make an engagement ring for her from that. In my eyes, that has more meaning behind it. Moreover, she's going on a trip with her sister to Prague & Rome in a month, a few days before our 7 year anniversary. Since she knows a proposal is coming, I was hoping to surprise her by showing up in Rome and proposing to her there. May not be the wisest way to spend my money, especially when I'm not exactly swimming in cash right now, but I felt it would be worth it for the memory and moment. To me, that's a better use for my money than some artificially-valued diamond. Seems like I'll have to scrap that plan and save more money for the ring she wants.",1347940408

But I think it summarizes into a perfect storm of moving the development team to a new product and putting the existing money maker on bug fix only, two rounds of dedicated sales staff that woefully underperformed (sometimes comically so looking back), and the landscape of paying customers going into insecure funding situations of their own.<p>On those points:<p>1- Moving the staff to another project was a tough call, but one I think I would have made in the CEO's position, it just was a gamble that didn't work out as well as we were hoping as it took new product iterations off the shelf for too long. But while the old product was keeping the lights on, its growth curve wasn't going to get us to where we needed to be.<p>2- I'm actually interested in HN's ideas on hiring good sales/marketing staff and how they should best be managed. Across half a dozen companies now I've failed to really find good competent sales people and any effective way of managing them without getting in their way. It's just a very hard position to hire for -- hiring engineering is a piece of cake in comparison. I think if I were CEO of a small startup, sales people would be hired on 90 day probationary periods. But I've heard counter arguments that sales folks in my vertical really require 6-9 months to build out their sales pipeline and start seeing results. However, some of the issues were stupid, like not answering phone calls or failing to handle simple contract negotiations without blowing the deal, or not wanting to manage contract staff to execute on part of the sale and simply moving on to other opportunities.<p>3- The customer situation was a surmountable obstacle I think by expanding the size of the sales net we were throwing out there. There were several related markets with better funding sources we could have gotten into that we didn't take seriously until it was too late. We also had some immediately good opportunities that got bungled because of #2 above and because the margins weren't as good as other opportunities that we chased instead and failed capitalize on anyways.",1347938995

That seems like a major oversight. I'm pretty inexperienced in the iPhone development scene, but I know with Android development this sort of thing is strongly discouraged. There's even a mode called ""StrictMode"" where any file and network access on the main thread will cause a crash instead of hanging.",1347937456

Perhaps demand started soaring first, which inspired the entrance of the new player, who quickly shored up the gap in demand -- thereby restoring supply/demand equilibrium to the market, and keeping prices stable. Not out of the realm of possibility.<p>In such a scenario, De Beers wouldn't necessarily or aggressively chase the second player into the new market. It's doing just fine in its existing markets, and it doesn't want to risk setting off a price war over the new market.",1347937434
4536070,comment,4535087,4535982,4,0,keemoboy,,,"""it will there in its own due time"" is naive at best!<p>Those comments dinging Dev Bootcamp as ""toxic"" or practicing ""reverse discrimination"" are revealing a dangerous ignorance. Decades of sexism, racism, and systemic oppression of certain groups are not fixed in their own due time just by natural evolution or luck, they need opposing, direct, and intentional forces such as the one attempted here. I recommend if you really care about the subject to do some deeper reading of the ideology and reasons behind laws and trends towards bringing more absent representation into an industry or organization.  There will always be individual instances of ""injustice"" while systematic oppression is being opposed, but whether you like it or not the system is still racist, even if you as an individual are not.  So even though you missed out on your scholarship there are thousands of white privileges you've received without knowing or noticing that you need to own up to as well!",1347937426

We're currently thinking of going with your strategy of getting the competitors on board, possibly reaching out to them one last time and offering them 6 months to see results from us before we ask them to pay for the traffic we send them.  But still, it's definitely going to be interesting. Thanks for your input.",1347937351

Bang on.<p>Apple does a line in 'oh, but you didn't get an Apple' better than anyone else (they aren't a startup but once were)<p>>I swear, De Beers has probably pulled off the greatest marketing stunt in the history of humanity<p>The Australian Meat & Livestock board came up with a marketing idea.  On Australia Day, which falls in the middle of Summer, it's very popular to have a family barbecue.<p>About 8 or 9 years ago, they came up with the idea that it was an Australian tradition to put lamb chops on the barbecue for Australia day.  Now, I've been around for a few Australia days myself, and I can tell you it's never been a tradition <i>at all</i>.<p>But they got a popular former football player to start running ads (in a humorous manner) to say it was 'unAustralian' not to have Lamb Chops on the Barbecue for Australia day.  The actual tagline is 'Don't be unAustralian, serve Lamb on Australia day'.<p>It has been a big success, and now they release pop singles on YouTube and generally create a 'big suspense' to see what they will do this year.<p>Overall, it's been a massive success, and in just a short time, if you arrive at an Australia day barbecue, it would be surprising to not find Lamp Chops sizzling away.  In another decade, it will just be one of those societal norms that will require very little advertising to keep it going.<p><a href=""http://www.mla.com.au/Marketing-red-meat/Domestic-marketing/Lamb-campaigns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mla.com.au/Marketing-red-meat/Domestic-marketing/...</a><p>So, these types of stunts find success when the right pieces fall together.

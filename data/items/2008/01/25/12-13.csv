104080,comment,104022,104022,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Summary: Psychedelic drugs increase the processing of the quantum annealing box because some biological plants like green tea have been shown to produce quantum effects. Further evidence can be found by analyzing lots of reports from people tripping and dismissing other explanations. Also this stuff must be in some way responsible for creativity and consciousness.<p>The video really ain't that bad and I even like that some people study if this might lead up to something. But lets just say once you start researching quantum effects in the brain you should maybe try to find arguments which are not based on yet another topic which sounds like typical 70's esoterica.<p>The basic building blocks for quantum computing could be there... yeah, sure, but unless he can present some stronger evidence this ain't worth the hour needed to watch the video. Though I liked the first half hour which was a nice overview on the topic.",1201265992

If you're near a school with prominent Schemers (UofU, Northeastern, Indiana, etc), then students are probably more open to it.  Heck, students are much more open to anything than older professionals.",1201265089

In essence, contractual terms are forced on everyone within the jurisdiction of copyright law regardless of any agreement by the parties to this so-called contract other than the copyright holder.  In fact, even the copyright holder hasn't had a chance to determine whether or not agreeing to contractual terms is a good idea: he or she must explicitly declare relinquishment of ""contractual"" benefits to refuse the contract's terms, and the only means for negotiation of stronger benefits is a lawsuit.<p>There are not contracts that stand up in court under those circumstances.  There clearly is no real contract here -- where ""contract"" assumes ""agreement"".",1201263827

I don't want to look back and see I wasted my time doing worthless projects for money.

I think it's an ego thing, or perhaps an insecurity. When I worked at Amazon the culture drove this kind of rubbish and skewed our hiring process immensely.<p>There was something perverse about being in an interview loop, all 8 of us ""not inclined"" to hire a single candidate because they missed an recursion terminator in a solution to something properly complex and scratched out on a whiteboard in 15 minutes. All of us nodding like ""that's so stupid"" and I was sitting there 100% certain of the 8 people in the room the 7 of us who hadn't conducted the same interview 50 times would drop a bollock somewhere along the way. Yet there was no way this ""otherwise competent, and quite nice guy"" was as technically astute as all of us gathered here today indulging in our nice cup of ego massage while other people got actual work done.<p>Now when I interview candidates I want to see some code you have written you are proud of. Above all, I'm looking for pragmatism, effective reasoning and discipline in execution.<p>I love the idea of a paid working trial of some length,  followed by a permanent hire but I've yet to convince the powers that be that it's an effective strategy.",1367911976

Post a job ad. Wait a couple of weeks for it to finish. Then leave the collated resumes on the hiring manager's desk for a while, then someone prods the manager ""why don't we have a -foo- yet?"". Manager starts the callaround, does the first round of interviews, makes a shortlist, then they sit on the desk again. Maybe discuss potentials with other staff, but it peters out. There's so much other stuff to do! Then someone says ""Why don't we have a -foo- yet?"". Rinse, repeat. It certainly doesn't always happen, but it's common enough.<p>At one place I worked, I was basically the sole applicant - my friend worked the other support role and recommended me. The HR officer (CEO's wife...) called me in. That went well, so I had a second 'confirm this guy isn't an idiot' interview with the CEO. A couple of polite proddings received no response. I asked my friend and he said ""I thought we did agree to hire you, that's what I heard"". A couple more proddings and the CEO said 'Yes'. But the HR officer wasn't responding. At this stage it was <i>six weeks</i> from first interview to CEO 'Yes'. We hadn't even discussed salary yet. I was so desperate for a job at the time, that I just rolled up and started working, because fuck it, the worst that can happen is that it's abysmally low and I go elsewhere - it's not like my days were productive otherwise. A panicked call from the HR officer the next day did a hurried salary negotiation.<p>Now sure, the last part of this story isn't typical (though I find it funny), but it took 6 weeks for me to get a job with a small, busy company who had staff with prior positive experience with me as a colleague and no competition.

Netscape was sold for $4Billion, and, on the last day of trading, was worth $10Billion.  Not bad for a 5 year old company.<p>Loudcloud/Opsware (which was really managed more by Ben than Marc) started it's growth spurt _just_ as the entire dot com bust took place.  Loudcloud Went public as the market was in freefall - it's amazing they even got it out.  About 1/3 the company was sold to EDS, and another 1/2 was laid off - leaving only 100 or so employees to form the ashes of OPSW.  I remember Marc's infamous ""Sharp Left Turn"" speech (this what before ""pivot"" became part of the common vernacular in the valley) before the company the next morning, when he rallied the troops around the idea of building a software company - where He and Ben basically executed an emergency maneuver, and converted the services/platform/hosting company into a Software Company.   Sold for $1.6 Billion, all cash deal.  Took eight years for that exit.<p>There aren't that many entrepreneurs who've had two $1B+ exits, so I would suggest your statement, ""Marc has a terrible record as an entrepreneur..."" - is flawed.",1367910421

When interviewing design shops, many of them stuck to an 'every other year' upgrade path, so many of them still used CS5 - which meant I also have to buy multiple revisions of CS to support/test everyone.<p>I'm a bit concerned personally though since this also kills the used market for Adobe products going forward (CS6 sells for only $700 if you look for just used licenses), although I'm hoping the reduced support costs of going cloud will make their products maybe cheaper in the long run.<p>My only possible concern would be the cloud-based plugins like layervault competing with Creative Cloud's features, but they could serve support for the non-Adobe crowd and support pixelmator/acorn users.",1367910066

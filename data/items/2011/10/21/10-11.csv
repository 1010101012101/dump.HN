For those uninitiated with the research industry, take conferences (in general, not referring to this particular one), etc. with a pinch of salt.  In some ways, conferences are the main mechanism for the organizing body to make money/achieve sustenance, committee members to embellish their resumes, researchers to add to their publication list while milking taxing-payers/profits (depending on her affiliation) to go on 'vacation' to present.",1319194754

The outstanding mortgage debt of everyone in the country at the time was 368billion.<p>Whilst I know there are many people without mortgages (because they rent) the knock on effect of paying off all the oustanding mortgages instead of recapitalising banks would have done some amazing things: it would have given the whole economy an enormous payrise which would have had an immediate positive effect on high-street retail.<p>Also because people would not immediately spend all of their new found money it would have gone into savings: recapitalised the banks indirectly. They were always using everyone's savings anyway.<p>It would have resolved the thing that caused the crisis: that being risky mortgage debt on the banks books. No more mortgage debt, no more unstable banks.<p>Lastly and probably most importantly, it would have allowed govts to raise taxes to refill their coffers because absolutely nobody would notice, and probably nobody would even care.",1319194702

Yes, the Supreme Court says it's legal, but why is there no federal cap on usury?<p>The only private recourse consumers have against bad business practices is a civil lawsuit, with the threat of high punitive damages. ""Tort reform"" wants to cap those damages, but promoters never suggest any alternative compensatory consumer protection. Why should I not interpret this as a reducing consumer protection?<p>Speaking of unions: Unions are a way for employees to protect themselves against bad business practices in the work place. (Whistle-blowing protection laws are another.) Many politicians want to break the unions, but offer no alternatives for employees facing those bad practices. Why should I not see this as politicians being aligned with business against employees?<p>How is it that the recent GAO Audit on ""Major Conflicts of Interest at the Federal Reserve"" found so many apparent conflicts of interest, and why weren't there policies in place to prevent that from happening?<p>Banking oversight over the last few decades (perhaps since the S&L crisis of the 1980s, but definitely in the last 10 years) has clearly not been enough to catch the numerous incidents of wide-scale fraud.

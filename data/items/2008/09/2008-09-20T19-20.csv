Genius, some would call him. You would, I imagine, call him a ""crazy kook"".<p>This is one of those rare instances where I wish I had more karma here.",1221940653

Under your ""perfect world,"" his competitor can come to me and <i>force</i> me to do business with them whether or not I want to.",1221940641

Which isn't true.<p>Maybe they are 500x more efficient <i>in the UV</i>, but in that case it's a meaningless number because the Sun emits very little energy in the UV.",1221939816

310023,comment,309268,309268,0,0,twopoint718,,,"This reminds me of a little sidebar in ""Fundamentals of Physics"" (Halliday et al. 6th ed.) that talks about how dangerous a rapidly spinning object can be. They listed a case study from Test Devices Inc. where a solid steel disk exploded from a test rig while spinning at 14 krpm. There were lead bricks thrown into the hallway, a door was now in the parking lot, etc. Amazing.<p>(This was a solved exercise, ans: about 20 MJ)",1221938911

310015,comment,309817,309978,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"I have a problem with your sources, specifically julian simon, as it primarily cites research dating back to the 1980's and does not take into account a lot of factors that are placing significant pressure on the CURRENT supply of oil TODAY.<p>A good analogy is a human and blood. Our bodies naturally regenerate blood... but we can't possibly donate blood on a daily basis and expect to survive.<p>What blows my mind is that you're stubborn about NOT innovating (job creation, less dependence on others -- specifically middle east), while both parties in the presidential race seemingly agree on one thing: we need to curb our dependence on oil.",1221937475

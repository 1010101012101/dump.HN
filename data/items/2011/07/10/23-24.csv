Boston VCs have in the past been timid and unimaginative, and they may be able to fix that by making a conscious effort to be more aggressive.  But the biggest problem with Boston may be the weakness of the angel community.  It's true that VCs are starting to make more angel type investments, but it seems unlikely they can completely replace angels.",1310342360

First thing I do is highlight all the <i>.c/</i>.h files in the folder (ctrl + click and so on..), right click, select ""open all with GVim"". The script opens all .c and .h files in GVim in separate tabs each. After that, I resize the GVim window to leave some space for a terminal to run make/gcc/gdb/git etc. At this point, I'm ready to look at some code.<p>Browsing through code is not easy mainly because of the tabs. In this project that I'm looking at, there are 10+ files and I know that's not even a lot. I have to keep hitting 'gt' or 'gT' if I want to go to a certain .c or .h file and it's a nightmare if you have 10+ tabs open.<p>So, HN what is your environment or workflow like when coding in C? Any tips on how I can make my environment better?<p>Here's my environment right now:<p>Laptop 15.6"" screen\nUbuntu 10.04\nGVim (NerdTree, Taglist, ctags)\nTerminal for (gcc, gdb, make, git)<p>GVim and Terminal are side by side.",1310342233

We describe a novel face distortion effect resulting from the fast-paced presentation of eye-aligned faces. When cycling through the faces on a computer screen, each face seems to become a caricature of itself and some faces appear highly deformed, even grotesque. The degree of distortion is greatest for faces that deviate from the others in the set on a particular dimension (eg if a person has a large forehead, it looks particularly large). This new method of image presentation, based on alignment and speed, could provide a useful tool for investigating contrastive distortion effects and face adaptation.",1310341563

I know this is not what HN is for but HN community is the only place left where I have hopes for. If moderators think this is wrong, you can delete my post.<p>I am a 4th year aerospace engineering student at METU (Turkey) and do russian (I'm fro russia, but study in Turkey)/english/turkish interpreting at large conferences for businessman and politicians (once to even a prime minister) for additional income back home but my real passion is internet, startups and technology.<p>I have built simple websites using CMSs like joomla and wordpress and have done domain dropcatching, linkbuilding, etc. before but I always wanted to create real value, to build or take part in building something valuable, something that is useful to people. I have been reading techcrunch and other 'web2.0' blogs for last 5 years and  always wanted to visit silicon valley and bay area to see the place where all innovation happens, where all these awesome people work on these awesome projects.<p>Thats why I decided to come to united states this summer and 'Work and Travel' program was most convenient at this point. The agency that arranged me a 'job' to work and travel turned out to be a huge liar. I was promised that I will ride a pedicab in San Diego for couple of hours a day and make enough income to travel the rest of the time. (thats when I thought I could visit silicon valley or meet local startup people). Now that I got here it and have spend 3 weeks trying to make money to cover the costs I found out that the reality is different. The rent for bike is 300 dollars per week, if you add apartment rent and food to that its impossible to become cash positive in here. I tried to find some jobs here in downtown San Diego and applied to 15-20 jobs but nobody even called back.<p>I have like 500 dollars left, which is enough for 2 more weeks tops and after that I will have to fly back to Istanbul.\nBut before giving up I though may be I share my story with good old HN community, where a lot of smart, rational and helpful guys hang out. I love technology, I love learning new things and I am a mature and disciplined person for my age (24).<p>If you guys think I could be helpful to you, or have something in mind that I could enjoy doing and cover my living costs here that would be awesome. I need a place to stay and any job. I am fine with crushing on the floor:) I am thinking of applying for a transfer to some local universities here so I may stay here long term.

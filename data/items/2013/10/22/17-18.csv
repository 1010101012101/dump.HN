I would honestly love to get your feedback.<p>Just so you know, when the book was more direct we had reviewers saying it was too direct and they wanted more flavor text. Our answer was an appendix of libraries in the back that listed all the recommended packages. Perhaps we should point readers to that earlier?<p>Also, if you are using Django, using third-party libraries is part of using Django. We feel this is a good thing because you don&#x27;t want critical libraries standing still waiting for the next major Django release (a roughly yearly event). A good example is OAuth authentication - if Facebook or Twitter changes it&#x27;s methods, you can upgrade to the latest django-social-auth or django-allauth and expect things to work.<p>However, as I said, I would love to hear more detailed feedback.

Or I guess I in this case I was just looking at the return type, so &#x27;int&#x27;.  Hence the problem - foo is defined so that if its type is int, it returns a string, while if its type is string, it returns an int.<p>The problem with giving up and returning &#x27;dynamic&#x27; is that dynamics tend to propagate through the code if you&#x27;re doing anything moderately complex.  If we give up, then any expression that calls foo() now typechecks as &#x27;dynamic&#x27;, and any expression that calls one of them typechecks as &#x27;dynamic&#x27;, and so on.  You end up with a typechecker that doesn&#x27;t tell you anything useful about your program, other than that it was dynamically typed.<p>If this is restricted to a few special cases like, say, Django ORM classes or namedtuple, it&#x27;s not a huge problem, because you can hardcode in specific rules for them (or put in a plugin mechanism).  But tricky typing rules abound even in the basic language features; as mentioned above, multiplication does not even have concisely expressible typing rules in Python.",1382464550

6593628,comment,6592400,6592658,1,0,enjo,,,"I work at Gridium (<a href=""http://www.gridium.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gridium.com</a>). We&#x27;re a 100% &quot;virtual&quot; company, meaning we have no central office. We work in several different timezones. Yet we&#x27;ve managed to build products that, by any measure, have been very successful. Good enough to see us named to this years Cleantech 100 (<a href=""http://www.cleantech.com/global100/global-cleantech-100/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cleantech.com/global100/global-cleantech-100/</a>)!<p>The point being, we are a successful startup that has made the lack of a central office a part of our culture. This is my first foray into a virtual company like this, and it&#x27;s been eye-opening.<p>There are several efficiencies that come with remote work:<p>1. Our team members are thrilled. We have folks in basically every stage of their working lives. From fresh college graduates to parents of kids in college.. and everything in between. Everyone has expressed satisfaction with how our setup has given them the ability to easily balance their personal lives with work.<p>I know that for me, simply eliminating the commute I have an extra hour or two in my day to spend time with my family. That alone makes me intensely loyal to the company.<p>2. It&#x27;s the best hiring hack ever. Did you know that there are insanely talented engineers living in Boise Idaho? Milwaukee? Conway Arkansas? It turns out that when you are allowed to cast a very wide hiring net, the level of talent available to you simply goes through the roof. Instead of sniping talent from local companies and participating in the hiring arms-race you&#x27;re seeing in the valley and in other startup hubs, we get to hire amazing people that those companies simply never consider.<p>3. We save real money. Since we don&#x27;t have an office, we save on one of the biggest expenses a company can have. We do pay for co-working spaces, but most of our employees choose to work at home. It leaves money in the budget for us to have amazing quarterly meet-ups. Every three months we get together and work on the company, but we get to have an amazing time while doing so.<p>4. Management efficiencies abound as well. You learn to really trust other people when you can&#x27;t look over their shoulder all of the time. Which creates a brilliant culture of self-managing teams.<p>There are challenges. When do you have standup (DO you do standups)? How do you communicate? Thankfully tools like Google Hangouts, hipchat, and a variety of others help us cross that gap. I think the most surprising thing to me has been that our virtual company operates more like a traditional officed one than I would have thought. We still have meetings when necessary. We still collaborate. Hell we still whiteboard things out. Just the venue has changed and the manner in which we do things slightly altered.<p>tldr; It can most definitely work.",1382464471

E.g. I need to discuss things with my designer, oh wait, he&#x27;s gardening at the moment, or he works at night.<p>* How do you know when to start/stop your day? E.g. In &quot;normal&quot; office, it&#x27;s usually 9 to 5.<p>* How do you schedule projects? Fixed time simplifies scheduling (&quot;This project is 5 man-days&quot;).<p>* Who pays for supporting equipments (desk, LCD, internet, nice coffee) if I work from home?<p>* Specific to 37signals: How did they make the video? Did the video guy traveled to each and every employee in the video to tape them?",1382463552

One is an internal admin site where we have managed to get very far just using Bootstrap components in the HTML without any custom CSS at all. It&#x27;s an AngularJS project and with Angular directives for Bootstrap (<a href=""http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/</a>) you can use Bootstrap like any native UI toolkit and if you don&#x27;t need a customized look and feel you can get by with the defaults or just add a Bootstrap theme (<a href=""http://bootswatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bootswatch.com/</a>) on top.<p>Another one is a large application with lots of LESS stylesheets and themed for different clients. By building our custom UI components in the same way as Bootstrap components are built we have managed to keep it very easy to customize for different themes. Bootstrap provides whole lot of variables as customization points and we have added a bunch of our own on top. By changing those variables we can create new themes very easily.<p>For choosing Bootstrap vs Foundation, just pick one you like. More importantly, use the components provided by the framework as much as you can. When you to roll your own components, make them in the same modular fashion as the framework components. Put components in their own files and namespace them with classes. This way you can keep things nice and modular, and your stylesheets don&#x27;t turn into an entangled monolithic blob that is difficult to maintain.",1382461671

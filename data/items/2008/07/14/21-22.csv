246130,comment,245911,246051,0,0,prospero,,,"AI <i>is</i> search, brute-force or otherwise.  There are a number of fascinating things that have come out of chess research on the way to grandmaster-level play, and even if the strongest chess players are all computers, that doesn't mean that it's suddenly become a worthless pursuit.  The day that a perfect game of chess is played is the day that it gets boring, not before.<p>With respect to go, the current approach is completely brute force; it plays thousands of games at random, and uses the percentage of wins by one side to evaluate the strength of the position.  The challenge is how to use the information you've already encountered in your searches to reduce the search-space to something manageable.",1216072748

I'm sure that's no different anywhere else.<p>My question is: what do you do about these problems? How do you curb local political corruption? How do you maintain governance of a mostly uneducated mass, while transitioning to capitalism? How do you keep the country developing while minimizing pollution? etc etc etc...throwing stones is the easy part.  Building is the hard part.<p>My entire point is: you won't be able to come up with good, sound solutions to any of these problems without a deep understanding of China, and even then, I doubt there are any really great solutions without side effects.<p>Edit: but to reply, a lot has changed since Tiananmen. I don't have to ask the Mothers of those killed, I can see it myself. Maybe it hasn't changed as much as you like, but it has changed a lot.",1216072337

Now, if this idea had gotten the traction it deserved, we could all happily be using telnet, FTP, whatever, rather than <i>everyone</i> having to be aware of encryption, your SA would just sort it once, for everyone, and they'd keep on using familiar tools.",1216070192

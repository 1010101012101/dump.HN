It looks like he&#x27;s not struggling but it&#x27;s such a closeup that you cannot see if he lost balance or not afterwards. I&#x27;m still very skeptical though, that gap would be quite hard to cross on a skateboard without a small jump and on a skateboard your center of gravity is almost 2 feet further back than on this thing.

In that case I would indeed be surprised if it was possible to (mathematically) prove a theory using this negative knowledge.<p>We can make use of negative knowledge to draw conclusions about a given system though. For example, if we do not know whether an electron bound to an atom is in its ground state or not we might observe the system to see if it emits a photon or not. The longer we observe the system not emitting a photon, the more likely it is that it is in its ground state. So here we actually gain quantifiable knowledge about a system from the observation of a &quot;non-event&quot;.",1439110602

I agree with the comments that you should learn to build things. This doesn&#x27;t mean you need to become a skilled programmer, but you should become familiar with the basic tools to build a first version of your product. There are a couple of reasons for this.<p>1. The best people are typically attracted by traction, metrics and numbers, not fluff ideas. If you can build a first version of your product and get initial traction it will be much easier to get people interested in what you&#x27;re doing.<p>2. Putting in work shows that you&#x27;re serious. For every 100 people that have &quot;business ideas&quot; there is maybe one that actually <i>acts</i> on them by investing their own time and money. This will set you apart from all the other people looking for technical co-founders.<p>3. It will make communication with your technical co-founder down the line easier. If you are doing anything related to software then you must understand (on a basic level) how things work and what tradeoffs and decisions go into building a product. Again, you don&#x27;t need to become a programmer, but you should have enough knowledge to have an intelligence conversation with a technical person about important technical decisions. Otherwise there&#x27;ll likely be a lot of frustration and bad surprises on both sides. Trust me, I&#x27;ve been there.<p>Btw, a &quot;first version of your product&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a be full-blown application.

LISP and Smalltalk have been doing this since the 70&#x27;es.  Sun SPARC even _had_ hardware support for doing it with no (zero) overhead, see tagged instructions (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC</a>).  Even on x86, it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> bad; the overhead for the general case is two tag extractions and three predicable (not-taken) branches (we must check for overflow), about five additional instructions.  Not zero, but the dynamic frequency of these is much lower in a high-level language than in, say, C.<p>The performance differences between Erlang and Haskell (etc) are due to many reasons, but primarily due to Erlang being a dynamic PL, with late binding and dynamic typing.  This makes efficient implementation hard (heroic efforts on JavaScript not withstanding), but Erlang makes no excuses as its strengths lies elsewhere. If you need fast compute you should do it in C and interface it with Erlang (lots of ways to do that).",1439107549

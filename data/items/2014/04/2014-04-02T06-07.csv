7514010,comment,7510435,7512303,1,0,beagle3,,,"> I think, compelling only if you can demonstrate that it creates a de facto requirement for outside advisors that doesn&#x27;t exist in other locales.<p>Optimization of taxes is a constantly changing, narrow field of expertise - and the complexity of even &quot;simple&quot; tax systems is such that even a cheap, mediocre tax professional will usually save you more in taxes (compared to a &quot;layman understanding&quot; of taxes) than they cost. In this sense, no country is simple enough to operate without a tax advisor. In fact, in Israel where I now reside, it is effectively a requirement to have a CPA prepare and sign off your tax papers, even if your business did not have a single transaction that year. However, the reporting is simple (compared to the US, anyway) such that even if you had quite a bit of transactions, your advisor can finish it in an hour.<p>For similar complexity, I ended up paying my US tax advisor approximately twenty times as much as my Israeli one. I pay for quality in both places, and the hourly rate of the US CPA is approximately twice as much as the Israeli one (that&#x27;s true in general comparing both markets). The US one just has about ten times as much work to do.<p>> Otherwise, the complexity of the system (which is not what I was talking about) isn&#x27;t much of an issue.<p>I guess a tl;dr of my point would be: In most of the world, a reasonable course of action is to make plans for business purposes and then adjust them according to tax considerations, whereas in the US the reasonable course of action is to make plans based on legal&tax considerations and then adjust them for business purposes.<p>I agree that looking at the bottom line, it&#x27;s just another business expense - I was just disagreeing with your assertion of a reasonable tax code. It is the case in the US (much more so than in Europe and other modern countries, in my experience) that where and how you incorporate, how you assign your IP, and how you time your transactions (short term/long term capital gains) can have a huge impact on your bottom line. Makes it much harder to reason about your actions, which is a non trivial (and hard to quantify) cost.",1396421925

Not a figurative engineer with years of experience and knowledge. The actual person that has the task. Pretty much everyone else in the chain has to make assumptions about what is possible, in what time frame, with what resources. Yes, the more experience you have, the better you get at doing that.<p>But trust me when I say that all too often, even product engineers for million dollar figure products, have little idea if X is possibly in time Y until they actually try and do it. (I&#x27;ve worked at multiple companies with multi-million product licenses, and seen it at all of them). Sure, a few of the delivery engineers had a much better idea. But there was no way any of the analysts, project managers, and especially not the sales engineers, had any clue about the time.

No-one should put up with being treated like that, ever, and I think you&#x27;d be better off just quitting, on the spot.<p>The matter of the project ignorance is itself is another matter. When faced with well-meaning but confused stake-holders, the correct solution is not to throw errors like a compiler (which is what the eng in the video does), but rather to probe for more information to understand the context of the request, and work toward a workable solution.

This is what leads to the easy to brute force passwords; the cracking techniques now cater for the most popular variations.<p>So again, while you may be right on paper, you can&#x27;t compare a 4 word passphrase with a true 11 character random password; they are on completely different scales of difficulty to remember.  If you&#x27;re interested, take a look at how the xkcd comic constructs the difficulty of the two passwords, it is fairly realistic.  For what it&#x27;s worth, it considers only &quot;common&quot; words (top 1000 to 2000 most popular) from the dictionary, and the passphrase wins out even so.

Being well-known in some tech communities (<a href=""https://www.google.fr/search?q=curtis+poe+perl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.fr/search?q=curtis+poe+perl</a>) means I can evaluate those candidates and I can also source them.<p>Yes, recruiters have a poor reputation and there&#x27;s a reason that many (most?) deserve that, but for companies who can&#x27;t source candidates, they&#x27;re stuck. Recruiters, particularly those who specialize, tend to have large pools of &quot;goto&quot; people that companies would never have, meaning that companies who can&#x27;t find talent have little choice.<p>The reason recruiters are despised so much is that there&#x27;s such a low barrier to entry to our field that this depresses quality tremendously.

Almost every role is a specialty, and almost every role requires translating requirements from others who do not understand the solution space into solutions which meet that requirement, and explaining just what is possible and what is not. Just as one example, designers translate things like &#x27;I need this text to read better&#x27; to adjusting the leading, measure, weight, size and font to something appropriate while meeting the other existing constraints. You could think of examples like that for almost every specialty, including designers, business people and accountants, who do things the developers don&#x27;t understand (but might think must be trivial, because they don&#x27;t understand them) which are just as vital for the company. There are also plenty of examples outside the fields developers interact with (engineers, architects, doctors, lawyers etc).<p>The meeting in the video wasn&#x27;t funny as a caricature because it portrays everyone around the developer as idiots, though I suppose it is a brilliant unintentional caricature of the way an ignorant specialist might see the world. In real life, the clients are not idiots, they just have conflicting requirements, and don&#x27;t understand the solution space, but they <i>usually understand the problem space better than the developer</i> and should be seen as a mine of information and gently guided away from making decisions they don&#x27;t understand. A developer (or any other specialty) seeing the world this way is a bad developer IMO, and someone facing something approaching this situation in real life should just get another job, as clearly working for idiots is a losing proposition.<p>Back in real life, both design and development require very similar skills - refining requirements, proposing solutions which will work, persuading clients as to the best solutions, taking on board their ideas and adjustments gracefully without compromising the technical constraints. The issue of dealing with clients who don&#x27;t know exactly what they want or what is possible is probably similar in a lot of other domains, and the laziest solution is to call them idiots and dismiss their concerns.<p>What I&#x27;d do in this situation is ask the client to rewind and state the problem (our lines clash and we can&#x27;t change the colour or make them see-through), not a proposed solution (7 perpendicular red lines, one of which is green and transparent).",1396419747

A couple of key points:<p><i>[There&#x27;s] a very long and well-established literature in psychology that getting groups of people together is no way to come up with ideas. Creativity is not a team sport. What you&#x27;re looking for is somebody&#x27;s individual, intellectual trunk to make new connections and come up with something new.</i><p>What&#x27;s necessary for devising new thoughts is liberating the brain from workaday tasks and letting them operate offline. When people have ideas is when they&#x27;re not thinking about them -- because the 90% of the brain that you&#x27;re not aware of is what&#x27;s key for creativity. This is way daydreaming, afternoon naps, and sleep are key for good ideas.<p>In the modern world, we often find ourselves doing too much -- too much ordinary stuff. There&#x27;s a great history of people and institutions giving themselves downtime -- time to do nothing and explore new things, which is when you get great ideas. The workaholic doesn&#x27;t come up with great ideas.<p>Open-plan offices (with their constant interruptions -- not just from colleagues but visitors, delivery men, salespersons) and interrupt-driven tools (phones, IM, even email) disrupt that creativity.<p>Creating <i>a time and a place</i> for collaboration is helpful.  Making that <i>all the time</i> is not.

It is an instance method on the class. It sounds like nitpicking, but the distinction is real. You call #new on a class because the class is The Thing that makes objects, not an awkward pseudo-global scope. Class methods should thus be things for which the class is the subject.",1396419281

Unfortunately we&#x27;re going to get a bunch of stuff in ES6 that&#x27;s going to change this, but the fact that we can have some invariants (especially in a dynamic language like Ruby) on property accessors is pretty important when trying to reason about performance.<p>The fact that Ruby only exposes methods is a language design decision that can enable some pretty bad architectural decisions.<p>Language features are about tradeoffs .For example, among other things, the calling syntax for ruby means that point-free functional programming is pretty much impossible (though there are possible language-level solutions for this). Depending on what you&#x27;re looking for, that can be considered a flaw , because it deviates from your personal definition of the ideal programming environment.",1396418565

Its that Ruby is doesn&#x27;t have syntactic conventions which imply things about the implementation of methods (the way, e.g., C# has with properties, which are simply a gate way to call methods, though there are fairly strong -- though not universally observed, and therefore dangerous to rely on -- conventions about what the underlying getter and setter methods should and should not do.)<p>Personally, I think Ruby&#x27;s way is the right way if you don&#x27;t have strong and language (e.g., compiler) enforced guarantees.",1396418552

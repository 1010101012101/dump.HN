We might take inspiration from our competitors, but we always check in with our customers next to make sure they actually want the feature.

In a bigger company, this should&#x27;ve gone to a design team...did Apple pre-Macintosh have a design chief? If not, then the calculator UI is one of those things that could&#x27;ve easily slipped into the low-priority queue, and there&#x27;s only a limited amount of &quot;oh-fuck-it-it&#x27;s-good-enough-for-me,-the-developer&quot; features that a consumer-facing operating system can tolerate before it begins to looks like amateur hour.<p>To be fair to Jobs, it can be profoundly difficult to communicate visual design principles. At least when given the opportunity, Jobs sat down and actually put his hand to the design work. It&#x27;s debatable whether Espinosa spending his time building a parameterized-calculator-constructor was worth the opportunity cost, but at least Jobs made use of it, which is more than you can say for a lot of executives.<p>On the other hand, this seems like something that could&#x27;ve been hashed out on a whiteboard or napkin...<p>Anyway, I think the real hero here is Espinosa, a programmer who took charge of documentation and the user manual, and went about his work by dogfooding his product (Quickdraw in this case).",1439229486

10036151,comment,10034883,10035980,0,0,Bartweiss,,,"The principle of charity is basically a way to approach new ideas arising from mindsets different than yours.<p>The &#x27;assumption of truth&#x27; step doesn&#x27;t require us to believe anyone who walks up and says &quot;A ^ ~A&quot;.  Rather, it says that you shouldn&#x27;t immediately reject a philosophy because it disagrees with your prior notions.<p>The &#x27;resolve contradictions&#x27; similarly doesn&#x27;t mean that we have to overlook flawed claims.  It&#x27;s a tool to help learn an idea even if you don&#x27;t get a perfect presentation of it.  There may be a valuable concept available even if the person explaining it to you can&#x27;t properly work through every detail.<p>As an example, most people who could talk to you about evolution can&#x27;t explain the development of eyes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you should assume evolution is bunk when you hear about it.  The principle of charity says &quot;there might be a good reason here, whether or not they can provide it&quot;.<p>In short, the principle is an attempt to get value out of ideas you&#x27;re presented with.  That might mean you&#x27;re engaging with a different idea than what you were actually presented with, but it gets you more insight.  It&#x27;s not something you want to use when faced with a concrete form of the document - it&#x27;s not a reason to pass a bad-but-well-intentioned law.",1439229474

Great story but the more common story is somewhere between giving up vs realizing that something isn&#x27;t that valuable to you (or as fun) as you thought it might be. you realize you don&#x27;t or probably won&#x27;t enjoy the process. The no pain no gain model is true to an extent but often a person got a closer look, they can probably deal with the pain, but the gain is no longer all the shiny and worth pursuing.<p>So you must look at the objective with short and long goggles to see if your understanding about it is right. As you do things well they might get more enjoyable with time. Finding a balance where challenge is still there but you&#x27;re in the zone of craft. Where you know you can make it work and the challenge is something surmountable. The memory of how hard it was to get to that point isn&#x27;t one of regret or pain.

It doesn&#x27;t preclude that success is possible. Besides, most of the examples you give are poor because, as you said, the private firms weren&#x27;t trying to offer the same thing.<p>For instance, much USPS expense comes from the fact that they have to ship cheap anywhere. The overlap between them and private sector is the closest you come to a valid example. Private security in most states doesn&#x27;t have to do much past issue warnings and call the police, while police can take direction action. A bus that runs directly to your campus isn&#x27;t a general purpose bus or serving most people. So, yeah, it&#x27;s certainly easier to offer a service that does less than the government one for fewer people and be successful.<p>Back to the actual topic at hand: fiber infrastructure. Laying out fiber all over the place has a high cost with low amount of money coming in. That&#x27;s for lowest tiers. The Tier 1&#x27;s expend 8-9 digits maintaining backbones. So, if government started competing, you can bet the private market would suffer & re-consider new fiber investments. The only model making sense at that point would be offering value-added services on top of connectivity while doing private investments where government wouldn&#x27;t go.",1439228332

10036036,comment,10034546,10035714,0,0,dperfect,,,"I&#x27;ve arrived at a similar conclusion, with a few exceptions:<p>Never changing past migration scripts should be a guideline, not necessarily a hard rule. With Rails, I generally prefer to use ActiveRecord in migration scripts (rather than raw SQL) for the purpose of keeping things more readable (again, guideline rather than hard rule). As you mentioned, sometimes changes in application code can break past migrations, hence the need to occasionally alter a past migration (e.g., placing parts of the migration in a conditional). With practice, this actually encourages one to write relatively &quot;future-proof&quot; migrations, anticipating possible future code changes and creating each migration with as few assumptions as possible.<p>At times, as in your example, a migration may alter data (not just structure), and sometimes old migrations alter data in an obsolete way that isn&#x27;t really helpful anymore. Occasionally (especially if the migration in question is time-consuming), I&#x27;ll revise an older migration, but I always keep it around (so the version still exists) and add comments to note what is being removed and why.<p>One thing that really helps is regularly running all migrations in sequence. My test suite would routinely run them all, and I never use a schema.rb to load a schema directly. Vagrant dev environments are always built using all past migrations. Doing that regularly helps ensure that the current database schema is always a result of repeatable deltas.<p>One more thing: I avoid migration rollbacks whenever possible. I&#x27;ve seen them cause more chaos than relief in already-stressful situations. In practice, this means (1) making sure the codebase before and after a migration can handle the database state before and after the migration, (2) writing migrations that allow you to easily restore the database to a consistent state if they fail midway through, and (3) whenever possible, fixing a migration and redeploying rather than attempting to roll back changes. A rollback is, after all, a migration itself, prone to its own set of potential bugs and failures.",1439228209

Any time we found code that was so dumb that it couldn&#x27;t possibly be correct, without documenting why, we still did a blame to see when it was written, if the blame was older than the current source control system we did a blame in the previous one (this could be 10 year old code). Once we found when it was written we looked at any commit messages, if nothing obvious was written there we looked at general code movement around the time of the commit, we looked at any documents changed around the time of the commit, we looked at issue tracker tickets filed and closed around the time of the commit, we looked at test cases written around the time of the commit, test reports that had different results before/after. In essence we did everything in order to understand how the person thought when writing the code. This had always been a code base with very rigorous processes around it so explaining things by &quot;he probably was lazy and let it slip by&quot; was not a valid excuse before all other reasons had been investigated.<p>Obvious &quot;errors&quot; like if(false) is a stupid example of this, why would someone commit if(false)?

I know the supply/demand is in favor of the applicants because it&#x27;s a highly customized software and we were a tiny startup before being acquired by a tech giant. Not very many people have actual real world experience. I know a handful of ex-employees that want to start a consulting group but we are all really technical. We have people skills from being customer facing consultants but I really need a project manager / business person that can cut the deals.<p>I think their is a premium associated with the company&#x27;s brand that allows them to charge more but I could probably charge 2/3 of their hourly rate. That would probably give me about 3x-4x my yearly salary now based on an estimate of not actually averaging 30 hours per week for 40 weeks out the year. I have no idea if those numbers make sense though.<p>Now that also means I take on the risk of finding and keeping clients, no paid healthcare or other benefits. I understand those things come out of my hourly rate at a company but it still doesn&#x27;t to be a &quot;fair&quot; split to me.

But I still look up that table.  Now the indirect threading you speak of:<p><pre><code>  int instructions[] = { /* bytecode */ };\n\n  void jump_table[] = {\n    &&lbl1,\n    &&lbl2,\n    &&lbl3,\n    /* etc */\n  };\n\n  // translating bytecode into adresses\n  void* labels[] = malloc(sizeof(void*) * nb_instructions);\n  for (uint i = 0; i < nb_instructions; i++)\n    labels[i] = jump_table[instructions[i]];\n\n  // main loop\n  void** lp = labels;  \n  goto **lp;\n  lbl1: /* instruction1 */ lp++; goto **lp;\n  lbl2: /* instruction2 */ lp++; goto **lp;\n  lbl3: /* instruction3 */ lp++; goto **lp;\n  /* etc */\n</code></pre>\nIf I got that correctly, instead of accessing the jump table at some random place, I only access the label table in a much more linear fashion, saving one indirection and some memory access in the process —this should relieve some pressure off the L1 cache.<p>Did I get that right?",1439226977

Ninia is a Python bytecode interpreter in TypeScript.

Unfortunately, running other languages in the browser is not generally possible. Translation to JavaScript is not enough because browsers are a hostile environment for other languages. Previous approaches are either non-portable or require extensive modifications for programs to work in a browser.<p>This paper presents Doppio, a JavaScript-based runtime system that makes it possible to run unaltered applications written in general-purpose languages directly inside the browser. Doppio provides a wide range of runtime services, including a file system that enables local and external (cloud-based) storage, an unmanaged heap, sockets, blocking I/O, and multiple threads. We demonstrate Doppio&#x27;s usefulness with two case studies: we extend Emscripten with DOPPIO, letting it run an unmodified C++ application in the browser with full functionality, and present DoppioJVM, an interpreter that runs unmodified JVM programs directly in the browser. While substantially slower than a native JVM (between 24× and 42× slower on CPU-intensive benchmarks in Google Chrome), DoppioJVM makes it feasible to directly reuse existing, non compute-intensive code.",1439226701

But rather than making college affordable, this aid has had just the opposite effect by driving tuition up across the board.<p>Increasing price (outside of aid) isn&#x27;t actually the opposite of the effect aid is intended to have -- subsidies always increase the cost before subsidy; the intent is that they will decrease the cost after subsidy for those receiving the subsidy since, under most reasonable supply/demand conditions, the amount of increase will be less than the amount of the subsidy.<p>And this would probably work fine for grants taken alone, but we can&#x27;t really isolate the impacts.<p>Loans, however, aren&#x27;t subsidies, they are cost-deferment measures. They aren&#x27;t meant to make college more affordable (in terms of lower net cost after the policy) for those who get them, they are meant to allow people who could not afford college up-front but who would benefit economically from college so that college would be affordable if it could be paid for on a deferred basis can afford it.<p>College loans, however, are problematic because humans (in general, and those younger than mid-20s in particular) tend to be irrational and to -- as has, I believe, been shown in numerous studies -- overly discount deferred costs, so that loans have the <i>effect</i> of subsidies on near-term costs while at the same time just being deferred costs.

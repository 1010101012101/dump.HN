Or because a lot of IE users either don't have the choice (corporate) or the desire or the skill (grandma) to upgrade their web browsers.  Perhaps CEOs of major corporations visit his site every day curious about whether they might deploy his service across their whole company (ok, fantasy), and then leave because he says he doesn't want to support them.  Perhaps his business could be 20 times bigger if he wasn't so obsessed with this issue.   Perhaps that isn't the case now but it might be down the track.<p>There are lots of great frameworks out there that nearly completely remove the cross platform issues in coding for browsers these days for all but the most unusual requirements.   This is not the issue it once was.",1236142751
502559,comment,502318,502318,0,0,tonystubblebine,,,"It's easy to poke holes in any form of journalism: it's performed by human beings who are fallible, with insufficient time or budget, about subjects which the journalist is at best only moderately versed, and helped out by sources with strong agendas.<p>For that reason, I'd much rather look at whether or not new forms of journalism are improvements and how the flaws fit into those improvements.<p>Take TechCrunch, which is a massive improvement on tech journalism for the simple reason that it gives us so much new content, but is also an easy target because they aren't afraid to post something before they have all the facts.<p>That rubs people the wrong way because traditional journalism is supposed to fact check or at least be based on concrete sources (although the sources don't have to be factual). That standard isn't going to work with blogs because they're putting out ten stories a day, where as NYT journalist might put three full days into a story.<p>So you see blogs like TechCrunch post stories that don't have all the facts lined up. Looking at an individual post makes it look like irresponsible rumor. But they don't stop with the one post. Putting out something inflammatory gets people responding and gets sources coming to them. Then they can follow up with more posts. In the sum, the posts make up a story that's closer to the truth.<p>It's sort of exploratory journalism and it seems to work well in other areas to, like political blogs. You see a ton of accusations on those, and some of them morph into full blown series.<p>I don't love the stories that are just rumor, but I think it's a big improvement overall because important stories are getting covered.",1236142473

A sign that things are working out would be a lecture not being recognisable a lecture.<p>But really, I was just think along a more basic line. A way to take in a lecture & (quickly & easily) produce a web-video based documentary.<p>IE take a lecture. Slap the notes legibly on a split screen & let users to jump around via a table of content. Links could be good. Maybe even sprinkle in some stock photos or stock video to break up the monotony of staring at a lecturer for an hour.",1236142407

They'll never be sure they're doing it right.<p>I think he is talking about an activist panic button for data. Too many cops smashing cameras.<p>It’s very tough without a confederate. Once you get it into friendly hands, even for a few minutes, they can spread it from there. Those international forces of evil probably have a server or two down in the old volcano lair. This ""confederate"" can be some service that copies data to many places like Freenet, CoralCache, etc.<p>If you don’t have confederates the game is very different. You are then trying to get a piece of data into the hands of many many people who are not previously expecting it, on the hopes that a few will read it and act. That’s pretty much the definition of spam, no?",1236142159

(i.e., many questionIds per participantId, many participantIds per questionId, and both.)<p>A databases query optimizer attempts to guess whether going through the index would actually require less work than going through each row. Remember, unless you're the special ""rows are in this order"" index, there's an extra set of disk seeks involved in following an index. If you thought that going through the index would result in you visiting all the rows anyway, then you should just avoid the index and go through all the rows. More specifically, if going through the index does not eliminate the need to visit enough of the rows, then it should have just gone through all of the rows to begin with.",1269615561

Start-ups aren't the only companies that operate under this exemption.  So do hedge funds and folks like Bernie Madoff.  A company that only sells shares to accredited investors doesn't have to provide information on its operations to its shareholders or the public, and so has much more opportunity to hide shady business practices.  If the limit comes down far enough in real dollars, you open up the opportunity for a ""shadow stock market"" that essentially skirts the regulations that we voted into place.<p>That said, my inner libertarian ranks the potential damage to legitimate start-ups much more highly than saving millionaires from ill-advised investments.",1269615322

It's likely that, if you're pulling enough rows off disk, you'll end up in a situation where you're hopping back and forth across the table, seeking left and right, and ""head-thrashing"". Sometimes it really is cheaper to simply read the entire table and deal with finding the rows you're interested in once it's buffered -- particularly if your disk controller is smart about readahead.<p>Sure, for simple cases where you're pulling a row or two from the heap, an index scan will be vastly cheaper, but just because they're sometimes better, doesn't make them <i>always</i> better.",1269615091

I don't know why the argument that we need to protect patients from themselves is so popular, because it simply isn't true and that has been proven practically in many countries around the world.  I don't know if you know this, but the law requiring prescriptions was only created in the 50's and it was created because of a couple of people making some mistakes and hurting themselves and that case was used to justify the <i>huge</i>, sweeping law that we have today.  In effect, a tiny outlier was used to justify massive change to the general population, which didn't have the problem.<p>Lots of people continue to die from misusing OTCs, everything from Tylenol to Lidocaine to Aspirin, yet we don't put those back behind the counter.  Parents kill their own children by giving them aspirin when they have a virus, here's info on that: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reye%27s_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reye%27s_syndrome</a>  If your child has a cold, don't give them Aspirin!<p>People actually do care about their lives and their health. Yes, there are some that are going to abuse drugs, but requiring prescriptions for them doesn't stop that abuse.  People don't stop abusing cocaine, marijuana and heroine even though you can't even get them <i>with</i> a prescription (outside some progressive states anyway).  Many argue marijuana is still illegal to protect pharmas, but I don't know.  Anyway, it's moot, because I don't care if people abuse drugs.  No one seems to care that people abuse money or sex or food and those cause lots of problems for entire societies -- much more damaging than someone popping some pills and going to a rave -- which actually may be <i>good</i> for society.<p>For the record, I don't watch that much tv, but that's beside the point.<p>The point is, the individual should be sovereign over the self. No one else should tell me what I can and can't do to maintain my own life and no one should be able to force me to give someone else my money in order to maintain it.  If I want to continue living, I should be allowed to obtain the drugs I need to do that as long as I'm not hurting someone else.<p>For over 15 years I've been a victim of this issue, I've studied this issue, and I've traveled to other countries where this isn't an issue.  All the arguments I've ever seen supporting the status quo in the U.S. simply aren't valid.  The claims that are made to support it have been tested in other countries and the facts contradict them.<p>Also, what's with the trend lately of people telling me they know more about what I know than I know?  You don't know what I do and do not know.  Seriously, you need to stop being so arrogant.  It just may be that I know a lot more about this topic than you do. One thing is clear to me: I don't need your advice.<p>Final point, practice does make perfect, but you could say the same thing about computer programming: No amount of wiki or google will replace the actual <i>practice</i> of computer programming, but for people who have chronic illnesses or well known conditions, they have years, sometimes decades of practice managing their illnesses and that could, in fact, be longer than many <i>doctors</i> have had practicing medicine on their condition, which supports my argument.",1269614984

All the Oracle databases I've developed against for the past 10 years use cost-based optimization: the plan utility shows you the cost at each step, the overall cost, the cardinality, and the space used.<p>If you want to get more into the system figures, you can set trace on and run the query. After execution, you'll have a file on the db server that shows disk I/O stats and many other system level measurements.<p>My own workflow is that I write the query first - typically nowadays in Toad - and run explain plan against it. I make sure the data returned is what is required and then move onto plan tuning.

It's also wise to include a sample letter that people can quickly modify and send.<p>Dear Senator Mikulski,<p>In Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Bill, there is currently a provision to change the definition of an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933.  At present, an accredited investor is defined as someone with a net worth of over $1mm or net income of over $200k.  Dodd's bill would increase that to $2.3mm and $450k respectively. And then index those numbers to inflation.  Unfortunately, while these changes may look good on paper, in practice they will severely dampen the flow of money into job creating early-stage technology companies.<p>Many early-stage technology companies are funded by one or more angel investors.  Increasing the accreditation requirements will reduce the pool of potential angel investors, reducing the flow of money into the technology industry. Between 1994 and 2004, employment in the technology industry increased by 616,000, a staggering 8% annual growth rate.  Through 2014, an additional 453,000 jobs are expected to be created by the industry as a whole.  Reducing, and in some cases eliminating, the flow of investment capital into this industry will hamper the job-creation potential while our nation needs it the most.<p>Early-stage technology companies are also responsible for the creation of innovative new products and services that spread throughout the world.  Many of these companies are funded with small private investments; some have the potential to go on to become the next Google, Facebook, Twitter, or Apple.  Entrepreneurial innovation has been in the character of this nation since its founding.<p>Please oppose the modification of the definition of accredited investors in Senator Dodd's Restoring American Financial Stability Bill.<p>Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter,<p>jcnnghm

In the old days designers used to build websites in things like Dreamweaver. And now they click together websites out of open source code (either low level stuff like Wordpress or higher-level interface stuff like JQuery) and add a layer of design on top.<p>I think the amount of distributed effort that is moved out of throwaway one-off designs and redirected to using and improving shared components has had a noticeable impact on the web. I think the same will be true of JQuery, CSS3, SVG, Canvas, HTML5 video and all the other things that are alternatives to various parts of Flash.<p>Maybe I'm not visiting the right websites, but I rarely see anything clever or unique done in Flash. What I do see would generally be much better if people were taking off the shelf components and inserting their own images, minimal code and music files etc. to create something that is unique to their site but also built from commodities so that there's a chance it might degrade gracefully, support accessibility, be tweaked for maximum performance and all the other benefits of being a widely used tool.<p>In fact many of the better uses of Flash already use this model (e.g. the standard Flash video players are better than 99% of the hand rolled ones that are unique to a single site) but it seems culturally alien to the Flash community.",1269613827

Staffing check-in desks and paying for baggage handling is a cost to the airline and increases turn around times as bags have to me moved on and off the aircraft. The difference is that Ryanair passengers are not, generally, making connecting flights at their destination at least not with Ryanair. They are flying straight to their destination, removing the advantages of checked baggage that exist for Southwest.<p>As for the fees, that is a feature not a bug. It means that people who want to fly as cheaply as possible can (no frills) and those who want the extras such as checked baggage pay. With a no fee structure, essentially the people who don't check baggage, check in online instead of at a desk, don't care where they sit (and speed up boarding times) etc are subsidising those that use those extras.",1269613691

They saved the money over last 5-6 years by being smart with their finances. Both are willing to invest $20k-$30k in me whenever I am ready. Neither expects crazy high returns (10% interest rate will suffice). They also know that if I hit it big, I will reciprocate well beyond 10%. Both trust me enough that no matter what happens in my life, they will at least get their seed money back in a couple of years.<p>Even though 25% of savings seems like a big bet, if you truly trust a person, it really isn't a risk. I wouldn't trade my friends for any amount of money so cheating them out of a measly $20k during a stage in my life when I really need their support would be pretty stupid of me. I have life insurance and so if I get hit by a truck, they will be compensated well. I don't see why it isn't bright to invest in your friend's startup if you trust them. Sure, money can get in the way of friendship but as long as there is honesty and maturity among all parties involved, investing can only make the bonds stronger.<p>My friend loaned me about $10k over the course of a year and I fully paid him back once I was able to. This helped strengthen our friendship instead of tearing it apart. So my personal advice is to go ahead and invest in your friend if you trust him/her. You only have one life and if 25% of your savings can change their lives forever, you gotta give it a shot.",1269613365

In 1960, we did not have a lot of dedicated QA staff, dedicated sysadmins and IT, dedicated server farms, and so on and so on. Programmers have grown up auxiliary support personnel around them. The same has been true of doctors for a long time (""nurses"") and will be more true, but the core doctors will actually be dealing with less and less of the routine.<p>The problem with your ""software is getting crappier like furniture"" theses is that it's flat-out wrong. If software was today as crappy as it was in 1980, <i>the Internet would not work</i>. We <i>can't</i> have the same bug-count-per-feature we had back then, we've got a crapload more features for bugs to be in! What <i>is</i> true is that we've got frameworks and libraries of a quality the programmers of the 1980s could only dream of, and a programmer can take these and trade technical quality for speed of development, and while the result can still be quite messy it is simply an option that didn't exist in 1980. On the whole though, software is radically better now than it was then; the alternative is not even technically feasible, it wouldn't even begin to work.<p>Seriously, if you think I'm on crack, go back and find the oldest source code you can. What you remember as a shining example of bug-free code will be revealed to be code that by modern standards is barely holding together and fails to exhibit bugs only because the task it takes on is so small there's hardly any room to trick it into doing something wrong.

Certainly not diets based on the idea that obesity is caused by eating too much and so the solution is to eat less; those have a <i>terrible</i> track record.<p>The way to cut through the scientific fog is not to argue about mechanisms and causation; the way is to look at who makes correct predictions, and consequently in the case of diets, what works and what doesn't.

Before online high school I was home schooled, and I'm certain I would've learned more had I remained home schooled.<p>However, as an alternative to a brick and mortar high school, I think the idea has a lot potential still to be unlocked. The high school I attended (Stanford's EPGY Online High School) botched the concept, for lack of good technology. Thus far online HSes have generally hobbled along by using corporate teleconferencing software--a clearly deficient solution. But with tailored software the experience could be very good.<p>In fact, it's my personal view that online education + OLPC or similar initiative could do wonders for third world countries. One of the biggest obstacles to education in, say, Africa are the lack of school buildings and the lack of local teachers, according to my friends who've done peace corp. Both of these problems are mitigated by online education <i>assuming</i> you have internet infrastructure. Since internet infrastructure is a major component of recent investment in that part of the world, I think it would be achievable.",1269612178

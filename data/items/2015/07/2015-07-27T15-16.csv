But... saying AI is bad because they make great weapons sounds extremely naive, unless it&#x27;s a declaration of collective sentiment (which is unscientific). Humans make tools, which include weapons. Unless we stop making weapons, which we are not, AI weapons will be made. And when have weapons ever been &quot;good&quot;? All weapons are bad so of course AI weapons are bad. Great weapons are extremely bad, which is precisely what makes them so great. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if they&#x27;d have come up with something better had they received input from the historians and anthropologists regarding this point. And now this naive &quot;scientific&quot; argument will be used against them to tarnish the reputation of scientists and marginalize science (but only after the 28th... naive again to think they can control social media and internet time; shame on HN for &quot;posting&quot; this early!).",1438012731

But as others have said when you raise the minimum wage, prices increase, and by far the largest groups that consume the same goods/services are also relatively poor themselves (so essentially you increase pay but also costs to the poorest in society).<p>More as a thought experiment than anything: What would happen if, instead of increasing the minimum wage, we capped the MAXIMUM wage at companies to 500x the lowest? That would effectively cap the CEO&#x27;s pay at 6.9 million dollars for ANY business which pays the national minimum wage. That might sound like a lot but a lot of CEOs at larger corporations are getting in the order of 20 million right now (and this would have almost zero impact on small-medium businesses, as their CEOs don&#x27;t make enough yet).<p>I guess what I am asking is: Instead of increasing minimum wage, what would happen if we could align the interests of the poorest employee and richest employee in a business?<p>PS - I am well aware that CEOs often don&#x27;t take direct pay and instead take other financial instruments, such as stock.

* More beneficial to (all) humans (for some value of &quot;beneficial&quot;)
* Having more of those characteristics of (some but not all) humans that we consider &quot;positive&quot;, like kindness and compassion.<p>Of course, there are other possibilities. This list was meant to be illustrative, not exhaustive.<p>Depending on the definition of &quot;more human&quot; that one chooses, the results can be radically different. For example, on the first definition of &quot;more human&quot; we would end up with AI that can fall in love, or get angry/jealous/depressed. On the second definition we could end up with AI&#x27;s that decide that what is &quot;beneficial&quot; for us might be different than what we ourselves think is beneficial (much like a parent might make a different decision for a child than the child itself would make). On the third definition we have the burden of defining exactly what those positive characteristics are. For example, does &quot;patriotism&quot; make the cut?<p>So my question to you is: what exactly is it that you really mean when you say you want AI technology to be &quot;more human&quot;?<p>---<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3eret9/science_ama_series_i_am_stephen_hawking/cthudp0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3eret9/science_ama...</a>",1438011865

They&#x27;re demonstrated to function as specified, in many cases rigorously. But so what? We also rely on assumptions about TLB coherence in our virtual memory systems (TLBs are probably not formally assured, given the errata). Are we free of memory corruption flaws because we assume the VM system is secure? Of course not.<p>And so it goes with systems built on high-assurance components. It&#x27;s possible, even likely, that the assured components aren&#x27;t going to generate security flaws --- and their designers and the CCTLs will certainly crow about that. But so what? The security vulnerabilities in most systems occur in the joinery, not the lumber.<p>Virtually every programming language ever used promised to make systems immune to &quot;certain types of attacks&quot;. Even Rails made this promise. The obvious problem is, even if you succeed in immunizing a system against &quot;certain types of attacks&quot;, attackers just switch to other classes of attacks.<p>It is not enough to close the doors on, for instance, memory corruption flaws. Virtually every modern mainstream programming language accomplishes this with ease, and yet systems are still riddled with security flaws.<p>Why? Because security flaws are simply the product of violated assumptions. Every bug violates an assumption and so every bug has the potential to be leveraged by an attacker to compromise security.

Instead, the proposal is to spend $80 million: about 0.25% of the NSF&#x27;s present budget, and less than a quarter of the proposed increase in annual NSF funding in the bill. In other words, throw this $80 million into the NSF&#x27;s general expenditure instead and in future it would be about to fund, oh, maybe about 20.05% of business-as-usual funding requests to pursue tendentious environmental-health correlation findings and non-reproducible treatments for cancer in inbred mice. (Until the supply of these inevitably rose to meet its former &quot;equilibrium&quot; with demand.) If that&#x27;s the opportunity cost of seeing if prizes can stimulate some successful research which will not otherwise be funded, then it seems like an arguable proposition, especially since prizes like the X-Prize are often claimed to stimulate research spending which is a multiple of the actual prize money awarded.

Hopefully some of these engineers will start their own small companies and this is where it gets interesting...<p>There has been a dearth of small electronics technology company creation in San Diego since the start of the 2008 recession. Part of me says that this is about to change, but global competition, regulations, and barriers to entry may put a damper on it.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to start a hardware company these days. There are lots of capital-intensive  requirements such as
adhering to safety, toxicity, and emissions regulations and performing the necessary testing to gain certification. These tests and reports can run in to the tens of thousands of dollars, and they have to be re-done several times as a product evolves.<p>I suppose this is why software-only companies have been popular recently. They are not subject to the same requirements as hardware companies. This may change in the 
future as more things are controlled by software, and the process becomes subject to regulation.<p>Please note that I am not against regulation to protect consumers and customers, I&#x27;m only concerned about the financial burden it presents to newly formed companies.

Being in business and being a developer I thought, hey ... it&#x27;s a Sunday evening might as well have some programming fun to see if I can work around this system issue.<p>Before starting I shot off an email to the support team to ask if maybe I missed a button, option or setting somewhere. Eventually they replied with Nope, not possible within their own system. Normally that would be understandable right? Some systems just don&#x27;t have some features, not the end of the world.<p>Except ... this issue is about having hidden input fields when submitting an opt-in form. I find it rather handy to have hidden fields which let me track where my opt-ins are coming from, thus it&#x27;s kind of a required feature for me. Though their reply was specifically &quot;not possible inside our email system&quot;. Well, after going back and forth and telling them I&#x27;m not using their email system, but just their opt-in page editor and using MailChimp which can accept reasonably any field ... I knew for a fact it can be done. It&#x27;s just a simple <input type=&quot;hidden&quot; .....> field!<p>After a few heated emails back and forth they just stopped replying and I got to working around their issues.<p>Suffice it to say: custom code and hidden input fields do certainly work, just have to work around it a little bit. So never, ever tell a developer something isn&#x27;t possible when we know for a fact it is possible (based on their system setup).<p>Sorry for the rant.<p>Moral of the story?

It was no the first time. In the past, I would be fine reading update notes and fixing the issue. But since I started troubleshooting servers at work, I have <i>zero</i> patience for doing it at home.<p>One other annoyance that comes with rolling releases is that you should update more often, to avoid making bigger (sometimes conflicting) changes to your system. You end up reading release notes more often. I could turn on automatic updates, but I&#x27;ve been bitten by that in the past.<p>Arch also encouraged me to tinker, and I was much more likely to make breaking changes to my system than I am now just running Ubuntu. If I had the time/energy to try out new distros at home, I would probably try Nix or something similar, that emphasizes rollback capability.",1438009740

What does the medial professional gain from letting you die to try save someone else?<p>If there is nothing to gain (no financial reward, or reputational bonus, or so on) or there is but they have the appropriate morals to turn it down, then they aren&#x27;t going to risk the nagging of their own conscience and/or looking bad by letting you die.<p>If there <i>is</i> something to gain (and they are mentally capable of letting themselves take advantage of that) then it is going to happen whether you are a registered donor or not. If they can convincingly let you die without recompense they can hide your organs in the paperwork so it doesn&#x27;t look like a non-donor organ has intentionally been used.<p>So whether or not you are screwed in a situation where this discussion is relevant is not at all determined by whether or not you are registered as a donor. By choosing not to donate you are not controlling any such situation in the way you hope you are.<p>There is the grey area where, for example, you have a 20% chance of survival but with the transplant someone else has a 60% chance - then things get a but more tricky depending on your paranoia level, though IMO the chance of that is rather small (the chance of getting hit by a bus on your way home from work or shot by some loon in a movie theatre is so much higher that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to be committing time to thinking about this) and to be honest I&#x27;d probably not mind all that much if it did happen... Then again some might discount my opinions here because many don&#x27;t seem to understand my reasoning in the following point of view: If I were in a permanent vegetative state or riddled with dementia or similar I&#x27;d gladly shuffle and donate my organs to help several others (who still have a chance of some desirable quality of life) on the way out. The only thing stopping me registering as &quot;FFS just let me go when I get close to that sort of state, because I&#x27;m no longer me and there is no point throwing time and money at keeping the husk that is no longer me going&quot; is that there is no legal way of doing so.",1438009689

The set of Scala features Spark is using is pretty much identical to Kotlin.<p>I didn&#x27;t mention implicit conversions, but that&#x27;s one area where Scala has taken the high risk high reward path. If you look a bit further down on the linked Spark page you&#x27;ll see the conversions defined [1]. I&#x27;d say Spark&#x27;s style guide is more geared toward Scala consumers and not necessarily library authors (i.e. if you know what you&#x27;re doing have at it; otherwise keep to a strict subset).<p>Basically, in aggregate Scala&#x27;s feature set is incredibly powerful; that power (despite the complexity, tooling challenges, and slow builds) is what draws dsl authors to Scala.<p>When IBM throws down an absolute boatload of cash on a project written in Scala, by proxy Scala benefits. Right off the bat there are de facto 3,500 new Scala developers (since the initial IBM Spark team will of course be learning Scala). Furthermore, it&#x27;s not like competitors aren&#x27;t aware of this, Spark automically becomes more of a &quot;big deal&quot; as a result, which cannot help but be a boon for Scala.<p>As for other JVM languages, agreed, Clojure has its own supply of awesome, though the lack of (built-in) static types are a no-op here. Groovy, meh, seems to be on a downtrend, I suspect non-immutable-by-default dynamic languages (except of course, javascript) will continue to fall out of favor.<p>Now, Kotlin, it&#x27;s a nice language. If they can deliver on near Java build times, might just be the Java killer that Scala will never be, or at least not in its current design (where, as you rightly say, there is often more than one way to do the same thing).<p>Let&#x27;s see how things play out over the next 3-5 years, JVM alternative language landscape is diverse and evolving quickly, good times now and great times ahead...<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/dsl/package.scala#L115"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src...</a>",1438009654

It&#x27;s the OEM&#x27;s fault, or it&#x27;s the carrier&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s dozens of other companies fault that Android is insecure. But nobody wants to hold Google liable for developing a platform that they distribute in a manner that is completely insecure.<p>Google sets the terms by which it does business with OEMs. And yet, they&#x27;ve never been held to blame for the bad experience that users get due to this model. Google uses these terms to protect it&#x27;s monopoly dominance, by mandating OEMs install 20 or so proprietary Google apps, but not to do anything really valuable to the customer, like mandating a security patching methodology.",1438009288

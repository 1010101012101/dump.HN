If you consider that you want at least 2 minutes of ""full throttle"" power over the course of a charge of the batteries, the capacity of them must be enough that the maximum current would be 30C, otherwise the batteries would be dead from just the hot rodding. Being that you're driving more than the 2 minutes of full throttle, I'd suspect that any batteries with enough capacity for an hour drive would have enough discharge rate to support what you needed to do.",1321581372

But they measure the wrong things because they haven't built the apparatus to figure out what to measure. And they haven't built that apparatus because they don't even know that they should be. They work on received wisdom, they let the numbers do the thinking for them.<p>Ultimately, it's a talk about the value of true critical thinking, of forming the correct narrative, and of stepping outside the bounds of the particular level of abstraction to see the same set of facts from different perspectives.<p>As a literature major, this is a talk about the value of a liberal arts education.",1321580616

In particular I'd have to talk about two institutions which had nothing at all to do with the problems I experienced. I don't want to repeat the nonsense that was flung at me by the troll.<p>I don't think I mentioned two of the worst incidents that I experienced at the height of two security scares quite a number of years ago in the US. I can talk about those. On one occasion I had contact lens fluid confiscated. At the time I had $240 long life contact lenses. These were not designed to be worn all day and all night, but my flight was a long haul. During the flight I developed a minor eye infection from having to leave them in. When I had argued with the security people over this I was told bluntly that US National Security trumped my health and financial well-being.<p>On a second occasion I was travelling to the US and would then transit to an internal flight (either that or I was on my way to the US and had to change flights mid way -- I don't recall any more because it was too long ago). En route I was told that due to snap TSA rules that when in transit between my two flights my laptop would be siezed and that there was no means of returning it to me. I was told that it would most likely be destroyed in a crusher.<p>I don't know of any other people who this happened to and I didn't see any news articles about people being told this. It seemed to happen because they were making up security rules ad hoc due to a major security scare. The cabin crew seemed to have been fed this info just before the plane took off. I spent the entire flight consumed with worry that I would lose not only the laptop, but a large amount of my work which I had foolishly thought was too important to make any copies of anywhere. I had actually toyed with the idea of convincing someone that it was cybersecurity research of vital importance to the national interest. But short of me making a pretty astonishing breakthrough during the flight, the latter part of that wasn't really true. Fortunately, all the worry turned out to be for nothing. By the time the plane landed, sanity had been restored and my laptop was not confiscated.<p>It seems that the TSA and US Immigration didn't really want me to travel to the US. Not returning to the US certainly solved the problem. I haven't had any problems with them since.",1321580475

The strong taboo against divorce enabled a lot of domestic violence and unhappy marriages, gays faced a lot of serious problems, and infidelity was rampant. Sexual repression itself has psychological consequences. We're still seeing the knock-on effects of this today.<p>You're making a cultural evolution argument as well, and my counterargument is that cultural evolution doesn't capture everything that we want to have in our society. Societies can function with the repression of women and minorities, with domestic violence, with marital infidelity. But all things considered, wouldn't we rather live in a society that functioned without those things, and with more satisfying sex to boot?<p>Furthermore, with the modern state of technology, the old order is probably unworkable anyway, even from the standpoint of cultural evolution. The old order was patriarchial and oppressive to women. It was always wrong, but in a time when women didn't work outside the home it was at least sustainable.

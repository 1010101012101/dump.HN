More generally, a programmer's learning path should go through (a) understanding how machines work (b) understanding C and (c) understanding the rest. You will never truly get the idea of Lisp or Python unless you know the lower levels, including the intermediate ones, which is C in particular.",1193259479

72200,comment,71952,71952,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Who knows what this study says, let alone how valid it is? Like just about every newspaper article about science, this Telegraph article absolutely sucks.<p>Here's what was the original journal article was supposedly about:<p>""...the difference in life span between males and females... grows in direct proportion to the degree to which an animal's society is polygynous.""<p>Great! These folks have apparently plotted a graph, where X is an animal society's ""degree of ploygyny"" and Y is the lifespan difference. The shape of that graph is the entire point of this study. It would be interesting to see it.<p>How many of the data points from that graph made it into the newspaper? Half of one data point. We learn that the male-female lifespan difference among modern humans is 5 years out of 80. (This is, of course, probably the least useful piece of data in the entire dataset, because modern humans live a lifestyle utterly different from that of all previous <i>humans</i>, let alone most other animals.)<p>The scientists might well have data about polygyny in humans, but it's not shown here. They certainly have data about polygyny and lifespans in other creatures -- but it's not shown here. If the damned reporter had just given us the numbers for <i>one creature</i> -- dare I suggest the chimpanzee? -- we would know a lot more about the original study and how much it applies to humans.<p>But no! Instead the article tells me that women live longer than men (duh!) and that modern human societies tend more toward polygyny than toward polyandry. (Double duh.) Gee, thanks.<p>Sorry about the rant, but this sort of thing is intensely frustrating to me. People wonder why the public doesn't understand how science works. Perhaps one reason is that <i>the average person never sees any actual data</i>.",1193258217

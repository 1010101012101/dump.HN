Work is what you do for money; it&#x27;s for your employer&#x27;s benefit, not yours.  The benefit you get is the money.  If they&#x27;re not paying you enough to justify giving them your time, it&#x27;s time to think about doing something different: going into business for yourself, switching to part-time, working for a different employer, leaving the workforce, demanding a raise, or some other change that will make you feel like you&#x27;re getting better value for your time.<p>Your lifetime is finite and you cannot exchange money for more of it.  But the idea that what you do for money should be enjoyable is embarrassingly entitled.  You&#x27;re supposed to be enjoying what you do with the money, not what you do for it.  Again, if the two are out of balance, it&#x27;s time for a change.  Otherwise, put in your time, collect your money, and don&#x27;t dwell on it.  Employment is just a means to an end, not the end in itself, and certainly not the only one available to you.",1448758671

This then puts the person in debt much further into debt still. Intimidation tactics, legal threats (which never materialize) and so on, not a trick in the book stays unused.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this with a close friend, original debt 45 euros (phone bill overrun, bill did not arrive due to a move). This then spiraled out of control until the total amount was in excess of a thousand Euros at which point I got involved and managed to get rid of almost all of it except for the original 45 euros + some token fee. Now if not for the fact that I was perfectly happy to go to court (by paying for the legal fees) and made this very clear to the counterparty (KPN, NL former monopolist telco) and their attack dogs it would have probably been going still. Very annoying how they prey on the weak. And of course, those with a good income never have these problems so for them it&#x27;s not an issue.",1448758554

10643258,comment,10642351,10642351,0,0,techjuice,,,"Some companies do not always want the best and the top of spear developers.  Sometimes a fresh slate is more rewarding.  Real example, the team I am on has had several developers but those that were the hungriest and got things done right the first time were those that started out with very little experience and had super busy lives once they got off work.  The individuals shows up to work earlier than needed, is always looking for something new to learn, contributes fabulous ideas that do get implemented in production and overall are normally a really good fresh breath of air.<p>These types of people help insure that you keep up your standards and insure what you are teaching them is right as they are fresh minds and you don&#x27;t want to send them down a bad path.  The individuals normally have programming experience in other languages or other areas but have never had the opportunity to go deeper into the work or were only allowed to work on the easy stuff.  When people join my team I like to give them something to own and grow with, which any wonderful top level developer, engineer, manager, mentor, etc. should do for those new to the team.  I have found it challenges you to improve yourself, keep your documentation on point and it helps the team grow and the manager normally scratches their head when they find out their new employee has learned so much in such a small amount of time.<p>Best part of this is you will normally be able to ramp up enough to be able to handle critical functions in less than six months, probably a small peace but very important that you have been able to master.  This helps free up more time for documentation, training, critical upgrade planning and more by the top developers so they can spend more time with you bringing you up to speed.<p>Do not worry about not being good enough, if you are what they are looking for you should be able to find this out in an interview along with being able to make a better judgement if you are a fit.  If you like the pay, I recommend looking for another job that has similar or higher pay, the only way to become a better developer and engineer is to gain more experience, especially with things you have never used before.  This only happens with new technology being introduced in the company or moving to a new job that uses modern technology.",1448758494

This physicist never played a realistic flight simulator, and much less has witnessed a real missile hit.  A 90 degree turn is perfectly possible after a missile hit, this is not an elastic choc!  Similarly, the plane doesn&#x27;t fall in free fall, in a vacuum!  FUCK, there&#x27;s an atmosphere, and even if the motors didn&#x27;t provide any propultion at all anymore, and even with most wings destroyed, planes are made to FLY, ie. they still have lift (cf. eg. the F15 that landed with a single wing).<p>So while it&#x27;s a good idea to check facts with some trivial physics, if you use simplified models you cannot begin to approach a description the reality.<p>Therefore this article should not have the highlighting it is given here (already saw it twice, that&#x27;s too much for such a poor article).",1448758233

That said there are examples of delays that they mention which seem to be independent of the amount of requests.<p>>> I believe you misread. They use a shallow tree in their scout js file; all of the resources a page will need are declared there<p>Being shallow doesn&#x27;t fix the problem when resources are split up at all and that&#x27;s what the article (correctly) suggests to benefit from HTTP/2 features. As we move away from a single bundle.js file we need to think more about how to manage splits. E.g. The article talks about splitting into `application` and `vendor` hashes, and you mention grouping by churn or functionality. So presumably we agree that being able to split files without significant speed loss is a major feature of HTTP/2.<p>All I&#x27;m suggesting is that the filename hashing strategies need to be improved to avoid application errors when splitting.<p>If we don&#x27;t improve filename hashing strategies then we&#x27;d still have to rely on small HTTP cache durations, or we&#x27;d get temporary errors while caches expire, which is a problem because the whole point of the article is to have extremely long cache durations. As they say,<p>&quot;Files loaded by the scout can have extremely long cache times because [...]&quot;<p>Then as the article says,<p>&quot;This can be solved by using hashes of the file contents rather than version numbers: vendor-d41d8cd98f.js. If a file has not changed, its hash will remain the same.&quot;<p>This is bad advice because they don&#x27;t talk about dependencies affecting hashes. Even if that file hasn&#x27;t changed but it depends on another file then its hash needs to change too, or else application.js will will have different contents depending on when it was loaded. Eg.<p>application.js has a requirejs import of vendor.js<p>requirejs([&quot;vendor.js&quot;], function(vendor){\n});<p>So if we generated a naive hash as suggested then application-45345345345.js might look like,<p>requirejs([&quot;vendor-3455345ABCDFFF.js&quot;], function(vendor){\n});<p>Then vendor.js changes but application.js doesn&#x27;t, and so application-45345345345.js is updated to read,<p>requirejs([&quot;vendor-f2ab4cde6f55.js&quot;], function(vendor){\n});<p>And now you can see the problem that application.js didn&#x27;t change but it&#x27;s dependencies did, so application-45345345345.js will have different data depending on when you access it which is exactly what you don&#x27;t want with long HTTP cache durations. This can cause mismatches in what version of a file is imported, and cause application errors.<p>The only way to have permanent URLs with content that doesn&#x27;t change (a prerequisite for long HTTP cache durations) is to include dependencies in the calculation of filename hashes. Or you could have an dynamic resolver (eg. based on a manifest file) but ES6 and SVG have static imports. More to the point though, if you can resolve it at build time why not?<p>When they say &quot;This can be solved by using hashes of the file contents&quot; this is a fundamental mistake and it&#x27;s simply bad advice.",1448757249

10643121,comment,10640729,10642721,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"Yep! Actually, this is <i>always</i> how it works. Every living creature that can see is &quot;colorblind&quot;[1] in the sense that it projects the infinite dimensional space of visible light intensity (a histogram of intensity vs wavelength[2]) onto a small finite-dimensional subspace of perceived &quot;color&quot;. For us, n=3. For dogs, n=2. For the mantis shrimp, n=16. There&#x27;s nothing special about 2 or 3 or 16 other than that&#x27;s how many different types of photoreceptors we have. The fact that we can represent &quot;color&quot; as an RGB triple is purely an artifact of the ways our eyes are built.<p>Anyway, matching color <i>really</i> involves making sure that the projection of its spectrum on the perception space of its predators is the same as that of its background (there are other camouflage techniques, let&#x27;s ignore them for the time being.)<p><pre><code>    Pa=Pb     P=projection, a=animal, b=background\n</code></pre>\nP is, as you note, strongly dependent on the predator! What fools humans might not fool birds and dogs (or vice versa) because we have different P due to having different spectral responses in our photoreceptors. Each &quot;row&quot; of P is a photoreceptor sensitivity spectrum.<p>Why should a programmer care? Funny story, about a year ago there was someone in here who was going on about how his company made bill validators that couldn&#x27;t be fooled by photocopied money. He was convinced the secret sauce had to do with machine learning. Of course the more likely explanation is that the photocopier (which is acting like the &quot;prey&quot; in our example and matching colors) was designed against the P of a human eye, not the P of whatever photosensor+light combo was used to inspect the incoming currency. The copier was tailor made to fool humans but not to fool silicon photodetectors, which will naturally have quite different spectral response functions (rows of P). If that&#x27;s all there was to the story (I don&#x27;t know enough to say definitively one way or another), someone familiar with the way spectra work would know that the printer was quite possibly one matrix multiplication away from working for this alternative purpose. Oops! Or &quot;tee-hee-hee&quot; depending on which side you&#x27;re on, I suppose.<p>For a more benign example, imagine creating a physically based effect for a video game or movie. The physics equations all take &quot;inputs&quot; and give &quot;outputs&quot; parametrized on wavelength. But all your art assets and screen colors are in RGB. When translating into the language of physics you&#x27;re forced to invent information that you don&#x27;t have (spectral details outside our perception space) and when you&#x27;re translating out of the language of physics you&#x27;re forced to discard this information. The latter is fine, but the former? If you&#x27;re not aware that you are making an arbitrary decision (i.e. if you just plug in our sensitivity spectra or ink spectra or delegate to a library that does so), you might find yourself unable to match nature, and it might take you a long time to find the knob you need to tweak in order to get correct behavior.<p>[1] By &quot;see&quot; I mean &quot;resolve an image&quot;. I&#x27;d be willing to bet that there&#x27;s a creature out there that uses chromatic aberration or continuous variability in the activation spectra of its light sensitive neurons to its advantage. But I&#x27;d also be willing to bet that it doesn&#x27;t independently resolve a full spectrum for each angle of incoming light.<p>[2] and direction of travel and location in space and polarization and probably a few more I&#x27;m forgetting.",1448755833

Then you&#x27;ll likely be in a dev-oriented team and feel more at home, and your work will be more meaningful because it directly impacts everyone in the company as well as their clients/customers.  It probably won&#x27;t feel as disorganized and lacking vision, but you may end up working on one thing for a long time, so there&#x27;s less variety.  You can approach it from different angles and do different things in support of it to keep up the interest.<p>There are trade-offs anywhere, but there&#x27;s a wide variety and you can find a way to renew interest.",1448755680

This means that with LSTs you can see the clusters at any density level without rerunning the algorithm, and in fact obtain clusters at <i>different</i> density levels. The dendrogram representation of the LST is also a useful visualization for densities in more than two dimensions.",1448755610

And, like any good and ambitious systems programming project, technical correctness is nonobvious and no one person is going to be right about everything all the time, because there&#x27;s entirely too much to know and too much to keep track of.<p>Unlike many systems programming projects out there, the Rust community has an aversion to screaming matches, personality cults, and other attempts to enforce technical correctness via dominance tactics (not only because they&#x27;re awful, but also because they don&#x27;t work - see the things Ulrich Drepper got wrong in glibc, and Linus Torvalds got wrong in Linux, because people could not tell them that they were wrong). Responses to technically incorrect claims are usually firm but gentle, technically straightforward and non-insulting. If someone persists in those claims, they will not find a constant willingness to argue.<p>It is entirely possible that you have seen observations that were <i>not</i> correct, valid, and legitimate, made by people who are expecting to be told they are wrong in the ways that the old glibc community or the Linux community would tell them that they are wrong, and never took a quiet and friendly correction seriously.",1448755326

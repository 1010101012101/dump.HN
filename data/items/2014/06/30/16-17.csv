7966105,comment,7965759,7965759,40,0,tptacek,,,"To sum this up:<p>A &quot;dark pool&quot; is simply a trading exchange where orders aren&#x27;t published (trades, of course, are). Huge investment banks run dark pools as a service for clients. The premise behind a dark pool is that institutional buy-side investors would use them instead of a lit exchange because they want to trade against other buy-side investors, without market-makers and aggressive, automated sell-side firms to skim off their profits. Barclays LX is a dark pool set up by Lehman.<p>It turns out that the idea that big buy-side investors can trade with each other without middlemen in a dark pool is probably a fiction. The premise probably doesn&#x27;t hold. There are at least two big reasons for this:<p>1. Giant institutional investors tend to take similar positions. If one giant firm is gobbling up FCOJ, the others probably want to trade in the same direction. So when you restrict your trading partners to similarly structured and sized firms, you tend not to have counterparties to take the opposing sides of trades.<p>2. The timing of decisionmaking at giant firms is slow, and there aren&#x27;t all that many of them relative to the market as a whole. So even if there are counterparties to match for trades, that match probably doesn&#x27;t happen within the window of time that the traders actually want to trade (you want to move a block of stock in minutes or hours, but if you can only trade with other giant mutual funds, it might take days to find a match; think about the difference between filling a market order on ETrade versus trying to sell your house).<p>So for Barclays to make LX actually do something, rather than just acting like a frustratingly inert list of big firms, they needed to get sell-side firms to trade there too. Which they did.<p>The subtext of the Bloomberg post is that getting the sell-side into the LX dark pool was probably a necessity, because when you look at the revenue numbers, Barclays was making its real money from the buy-side; the HFT traders paid it a pittance compared to the mutual funds. All things being equal, it was economically irrational for Barclays to court HFT firms. Of course, in reality it was entirely rational, because without the automated traders, no trades would have happened at all.",1404147423
7966104,comment,7965077,7965769,6,0,mattzito,,,"Except that roads <i>do</i> create traffic.  Your line of thinking was exactly what drove NYC&#x27;s road construction boom in the 40s and 50s - new road is built, utilization briefly goes down, then, as soon as people realize that there&#x27;s now a faster, more convenient way to get into the city, they start using it.  Utilization goes back up.<p>Critically, many of those people are people who might have taken mass transit or carpooled.  They are literally new demand in the system driven by new capacity.<p>Over a longer time period, there&#x27;s an even deeper effect, where new roads and perceived availability of road transit drives more people to move to previously undesirable parts of metro areas, which increases population which increases demand.",1404147411

7966100,comment,7965077,7965077,1,0,phkahler,,,"These guys are partially idiots. Obviously there is more demand than road if use is directly proportional to supply as they claim. The problem is the way we design cities and lay out the roads. A regular grid where we put STOP lights? seriously? Go, stop, go, stop. And then we put businesses right on the corners to increase congestion right where it&#x27;s already bad. When cars get tested for EPA MPG ratings, the average speed on the city drive cycle is slightly under 20mph due to all the stop and go. Hybrid cars get better city mpg than highway by using regenerative braking to recover energy from all that stopping and making drag the dominant factor. I don&#x27;t think traffic circles are relevant, but designing the layout to minimize disruptions to flow altogether. I&#x27;ve been contemplating this a lot, but can&#x27;t write it all here right now. Imagine if every drive were 10-20 percent longer distance, but you could average twice the speed over the journey! You&#x27;d save gas and time. And if your journey takes less time, that&#x27;s fewer car-minutes on the road which means less traffic and they could have fewer lanes. The problem is even if we could do the design correctly, nobody is going to build a city from scratch - except in China maybe.",1404147382

NYC has over 3 million housing units. There are many fewer overseas billionaires, fortunately.<p>I own and occupy a 2-bd 2-bath condo in NYC. It&#x27;s in Central Harlem and I love it here. I have no thought of moving and am not worried that Russian oligarchs are going to turn the city into an empty wasteland.<p>Real estate prices in Manhattan are heavily influenced by neighborhood naturally and, on the very high end, signature amenities such as wrap-around terraces and views of Central Park. But we&#x27;re talking about 10,000 ultra-high-end units out of 3 million across the 5 boroughs.<p>In my Manhattan neighborhood, even new condos in full-service concierge buildings are vastly more affordable than the small slice of luxury units described in this article. The price per sq ft in Harlem is one-third of what NY Mag is talking about.<p>I say, let the billionaires blow their dough on my town.

I would never recommend signing a mobile phone contract, but most of them do credit checks when you do 2-year contracts. Utility companies also do credit checks to determine whether you need to pay a deposit.<p>It depends on where you are and how competitive the rental market is, but in NYC, it strongly helps to have a credit history in order to sign a lease.<p>Landlords (at least for the apartments you&#x27;d want to live in) generally are reluctant to sign leases for new college graduates unless they have a guarantor on the lease (many require that the guarantor make 80x the monthly rent in income and live in the tri-state area).<p>Having a solid credit history not only makes them more likely to waive these requirements, but also more willing to accept an offer for lower rent (because they&#x27;re more confident that you will pay rent on time and not cause damages, the two things that they care about the most).<p>None of this is worth &quot;taking on significant debt&quot;, but fortunately, you don&#x27;t have to take on any debt at all in order to build a credit history.",1404147219

7966083,comment,7965599,7965599,5,0,grmarcil,,,"If you don&#x27;t have a credit card in your name yet, get one. Since you are still a student, you&#x27;re probably eligible for a student credit card, which most of the major card issuers offer and (I think) is generally easier to get with limited credit history. If you can&#x27;t get that, talk to someone at your credit union or bank about opening a secured or co-signed (by a willing parent or guardian with good credit history) card to get you started. Make sure you get a card without an annual fee. Even if you eventually no longer use your &quot;starter&quot; credit card, keep the account open and stick it in a drawer. Accounts that have been open longest are good for your credit history (and this is why you should, at least, start with a no-fee card).<p>As others have said, on-time payments and length of history are mostly key. As you build credit, get another card or two with higher credit limits. Call your cards&#x27; customer support lines every year or so and ask for a higher limit. Having a high limit (assuming you will not abuse it and rack up debt you can&#x27;t pay) is good in itself, but mostly I&#x27;m suggesting this since the fraction of your credit that you actively use factors into your credit score, and a low fraction is better.<p>As someone else mentioned, diverse sources of credit are good for your history too. Assuming you&#x27;re not looking to buy a house soon, an auto loan is probably the only other type you&#x27;d get. Even if you can buy a car in cash, think about financing through your credit union. If you can get a loan with a lower APR than what you might conservatively get with that cash sitting in an investment account (4-5%), you&#x27;ll at least break even financially and the credit history may be worth it when you&#x27;re looking at mortgages.",1404147212

As you make it easier to drive into a city, more people will opt to do so, thereby increasing both demand and capacity.<p>You even see this in US cities like Atlanta that are not islands, where increasing demand led to more and more road construction, which drove more and more people to live further and further outside the city, since they could just drive an extra 15-20 minutes each day.  In the end, the only thing that capped demand for Atlanta was rising gas prices, making it more expensive to commute.<p>That&#x27;s why you talk about capacity and utilization - demand is effectively infinite until other costs and considerations reduce demand.",1404147075

If you want to learn the basics of chemistry, you can learn that at a university. But as a rule they will not teach you tradecraft, you will not learn techniques specific to the manufacture of industrial quantities of chemical compounds, those you will need to learn on the job.<p>But when it comes to software engineering the gulf is even more severe and important. Firstly, computer science theory is extremely rarely applicable to software development, and is far less a suitable foundation for a typical career in industry than typical science degrees are. Secondly, the highly specialized knowledge and skills necessary to become even just a basically competent software developer are sufficiently large and requiring of expert instruction as to be comparable to many professional trades.<p>But there are a few problems here. For one it&#x27;s just not practical for employers to attempt to use on the job training to force feed new hires that knowledge, as it would require education in lieu of productive work to the tune of maybe 2 entire developer-years, give or take. For another, it&#x27;s also not practical to try to back feed a trade-school education into typical CS degree programs. For yet another, most attempts at trade-school software development educations are huge failures. Partly because almost no one with enough smarts and talent to actually become a good developer would attend a trade school, and partly because there&#x27;s no agreed upon objective standard curriculum for development as a trade. Currently the best way to learn is through apprenticeship (decidedly hit or miss) or autodidactism (currently the most prominent method).<p>Of course another side effect of this is that because the most important education a developer receives is a subjective, informal, mostly undocumented one it is almost impossible to tell how good a developer <i>or even whether they are fundamentally competent in the trade</i> just by looking at their credentials.<p>For various reasons these conditions will continue to prevail for some time.

It is definitely true that in a perfectly abstract system that if your roads are 70% utilized across the board, and you double capacity, you won&#x27;t stay at 70% capacity.<p>However, what <i>does</i> happen is that when you take a road at 70% capacity and double it, so it has a lot more room, some people will move from other 70% utilized roads to your road, and yet more people will decide to drive instead of taking the bus or train, and the utilization of the whole system will remain largely flat at ~70%.<p>This was seen time and time again in NYC, where even at the peak of construction of roadways in and out of the city under Robert Moses, every new bridge, tunnel, and highway was at >80% utilization within days or weeks of completion.  IIRC, the total amount of major roadways in and around NYC was increased by 5-10x from the 1940s to 1950s, and yet traffic congestion and utilization actually <i>increased</i> over this time.<p>It took a number of years of urban planning research to identify that as you increase the number of roads, more people opt to drive in lieu of mass transit or not making the trip at all.<p>So, i would argue that in an abstract sense you are correct, but in the context of a major city, a single major road change does not ease congestion, as it simply changes traffic flows and increases demand.",1404145017

There&#x27;s no formalism to consulting &quot;agencies&quot;. Basically: if you&#x27;re talking to a BigCo who wants you to work as a sub through one of their vendors, that&#x27;s a sales objection. If you&#x27;re doing commodity consulting work, like the same front-end web software development work that their vendors already sell them, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time displacing the vendor, because doing that costs them money and incurs risk.<p>Three responses to that trap:<p>* Specialize further, so that the work you do isn&#x27;t substitutable by work they can buy from one of their big vendors. Note that you will not have an easy time trying to specialize in <i>technology</i> (being the best Angular.js developer in the world does not make it easier for you to sell web front-end work against a huge vendor that already provides that); you need to find ways to specialize in business model and problem domain.<p>* Pick more appropriate clients. This sounds flippant, but it&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s one of the core problems of sales. If you&#x27;re running into potential clients that all want you to sub, you need to do a better job of <i>qualifying your leads</i> so you don&#x27;t waste time on prospects who aren&#x27;t going to sign an MSA for you.<p>* Grow. BigCos can ask a single-person shop to sub through an existing vendor, but they can&#x27;t reasonably ask a 10-person shop to do the same thing, because no 10-person shop would ever do that.",1404144881

If you carry a load of debt and pay it off, your score goes up so people can lend you more debt. That&#x27;s the wrong question. The proper question is how can you remain out of debt and build your wealth? You don&#x27;t need a credit score for that. As a 30something looking back at 10 years of debt, I totally regret it. Carrying debt is heavy on the soul and limits your options.

A side effect of that is that some of the code is very tightly coiled around the render-form post-form flow of a standard, 2001-era web application.<p>Another reason is that Graham simply seems a little allergic to Javascript. When you look at HN, think Rails 1 (they come from similar eras). Today, if you had an application like HN, you&#x27;d probably have a serverside that primarily provided a JSON HTTP API for a Javascript project that managed almost all the actual UX. But that wasn&#x27;t at all a normal way to design applications back when HN was first written.",1404144219

Additionally, any &quot;infix operator&quot; can be used in prefix form, by surrounding it in parens - and any function name can be used in infix form, by surrounding it in `backticks`.<p>All other operators, like +, -, $, <, <$>, >>=, are defined in libraries (specifically in Prelude, the &quot;standard library&quot;) - these operators cannot be overloaded in ad-hoc manner as operator overloading is done in other languages (bar qualified module imports) - to make use of one of these operators you must implement an instance of the class which contains it, such as Num for +, -. There&#x27;s also the requirement to implement fromInteger, signum, negate, etc in Num. (If you can&#x27;t think of a valid &quot;fromInteger&quot; implementation for your custom type, it&#x27;s obviously not a Num). Also, some classes have associated laws which should prevent you from using them incorrectly<p>Admittedly the class/instance scenario could be improved with further checking of these &quot;laws&quot;, but that would basically require a full theorem prover baked into the language - something that Haskell will probably get sooner or later.<p>There&#x27;s still what I would consider &quot;operator abuse&quot; in Haskell - it&#x27;s not that of overloading existing operators, but that of introducing new operator aliases for virtually every function in your library, as <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.1.2/docs/Control-Lens-Operators.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-4.1.2/docs/Control-L...</a> does (yuck).<p>A nice convenient feature of Haskell is that you can scrap the official Prelude library (-XNoImplicitPrelude) and roll your own, as some others have done (e.g, <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/classy-prelude"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/classy-prelude</a>). This allows you to effectively &quot;clean up&quot; some of the warts from the early design of the language, so it can continually improve - rather than needing to invent a whole new language when we decide it&#x27;s not what we want.

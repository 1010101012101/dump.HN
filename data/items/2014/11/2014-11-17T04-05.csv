I&#x27;m sorry for having exported this hypothesis into a context where it shouldn&#x27;t have been said without additional qualifiers, but it&#x27;s too late now to edit it out.<p><i>> This isn&#x27;t really part of the physics either; it&#x27;s an interpretation</i><p>That&#x27;s actually one I stand by. In the end, this seems really more about how you choose to express ideas in a language that doesn&#x27;t have any exact words for things going on in an object that lies far outside of our normal experience. You might (and I suspect you do) choose to not say anything at all and let equations speak for themselves, but that doesn&#x27;t really work for most people. So you&#x27;re stuck with choosing lenses that render this foreign reality on a canvas you can actually picture. I also think there is nothing wrong in principle about choosing this particular representation.<p><i>>  I would say it&#x27;s most likely not possible on our best current theories.</i><p>Well, we know spacetime is not rigid. We know that interesting dynamics exist at the extreme limits of physical values. We also know that there is a large chunk yet to be discovered about the nature of the substrate on which reality rests. You are completely within your rights to look at everything we know and have ruled out so far and proclaim a high likelihood of impossibility, but along the same line of thought I reserve the right to declare the glass half full ;)<p>The truth is that neither of us are likely to live to see a definite answer play out.",1416200167

Yes, I&#x27;m asking this (annoying) question even though the OP states, &quot;Lyra is more expressive than interactive systems like Tableau, allowing designers to create custom visualizations comparable to hand-coded visualizations built with D3 or Processing.&quot;<p>...yeah, but how exactly? Because it looks about as complicated of a GUI as Tableau...and I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge of Tableau to compare it against the video, as Tableau&#x27;s interface is so befuddling that I thank God I stumbled unto web development, as painful as that journey has been, so that I could code my own interactives rather than have to learn Tableau&#x27;s conventions.<p>I guess the issue with Lyra is the same with all other programs that claim &quot;custom visualization design without writing any code&quot;...the two desired features, &quot;custom&quot; and &quot;without writing any code&quot;...are, IMHO, at odds with one another. If you want to do anything custom and interactive, you will pretty much have to do something as complicated as code...and pushing a series of buttons and clicking through menus may end up as being as intellectually challenging as just learning programming.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t see how the Lyra visualizations are comparable to D3...D3 is amazing because it is a relatively minimalistic framework for coding visualizations...the kind of flexible, expressive visualizations you can do are possible because you are allowed to expressively code them via D3.

Talking to regular folks, there seems to be divergence between what regular folks thinks need to be done compared to government.<p>The regular folks want to see Dollar-Yen parity. As Yen drops, things become more expensive and regular folks cut back more on spending. I am not sure why increasing cost of imports doesn&#x27;t show up as inflation. Things would have been worse if not for drop in oil prices (major import for Japan). These folks don&#x27;t believe dropping Yen is the solution as majority of investment by Japanese companies is outside Japan and weaker Yen just reduces that investment, in turn less profit flow back in the country.<p>The expectation of deflation is deeply rooted in regular folks. Everyone is waiting to spend on large items, just not right now. Land prices are falling so no one wants to buy a house now. We were interested in buying a place in Sapporo but everyone told us to wait until we really need to buy. An apartment costing $200-300K rents for $500-700/mo in Sapporo compared to similar place in Seattle renting for $1,000+/mo. One of our friend mentioned that they just sold their house in Sapporo and had to offer healthy discount to the buyer.<p>I don&#x27;t have a solution to Japan&#x27;s problems. But QE, weaker Yen, and raising taxes doesn&#x27;t appear to be the solution. Rolling back tax increases may be a start in the right direction.<p>Regular folks seems to have better pulse on the problem than establishments.",1416198982

In your case, you have had a bad usability experience with systemd; and I can&#x27;t deny your experience.

Fedora is my desktop and laptop OS of choice, and I don&#x27;t think I did anything to make my rc.local files work. I don&#x27;t use them for much, but I do have some custom hard disk spin down times and such setup on one of my machines, which continued to function after upgrading to a systemd-based version.<p>If your distro opted not to enable the compatibility layer by default, I suspect there&#x27;s an easy way to do it yourself with a single command line or installation of a package.<p>Our servers all run CentOS and we&#x27;ve put a couple of new CentOS 7 systems online recently, and while we don&#x27;t have any rc.local bits running on them, we do still have a few old style initscripts (in our products, embarrassingly enough, even though our bootup and shutdown module supports systemd and upstart, we still ship initscripts to start our own stuff), and they have continued to function correctly on CentOS 7.<p>In short, it has not been my experience that doing things the old way has been dramatically cut off for people who need to continue doing so for the time being.

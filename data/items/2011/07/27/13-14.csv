The irony is that these systems make it difficult for people who don't have a ""perfect"" (from the perspective of the system) record to get in.<p>The problem with such systems is that it is difficult to assess someone's ability to perform a job objectively. So the systems are design around measurable facts (ie. years of experience, education), biased towards promoting from withing, with the final selection being made by rolling the dice using tools like job interviews that are at best randomizers.<p>Humans aren't ""resources"" -- they are people.

My recent experience is that a large number of them have absolutely no clue about the industry they are recruiting for. I am a Web Designer/Client-Side Developer. I work in HTML, CSS, Javascript and pretty images. But I kept getting recruiters insisting on submitting me for jobs involving .Net development, SQL and other various server-side technologies. I kept having to tell them I didn't want to have interviews for jobs I had no business applying for, heaven forbid I actually got the job. So far I only had a good experience with one recruiter out of many in my area.<p>Of course, some of the employers weren't much better. No one can decide on a job title nor job description so you get a bunch of different postings and you have no idea if you qualify. I can't tell you how many job postings I saw that required three people (designer, client-side developer, server-side developer) in the one position that paid below the going rate for just one of the skill sets. It's as if they hope to find that rare individual that can do EVERYTHING and is willing to do it for just a cup of coffee a day. Often times I would discover that the employer thought they wanted Skill Set A when they really wanted the non-related Skill Set B of which I did not qualify.<p>Sometimes it seems as if an employer finding a good employee is by pure luck.",1311773866

I love Dropbox (for better or worse my life lives inside it).<p>We excel in an environment where an organisation needs to push content out to their employees in a managed environment. \nFor example pushing sales content out to staff.<p>Our security model allows you to push content out to staff, but manage how that content is used.\nFor example you might have some sales content that an employee can view and open with a potential client, and you may allow that content to be shared with the client via email. \nYou might have other content that is for internal use only, such as training content, this content can be watermarked 'confidential' and sharing is disabled.<p>We also force the iOS app to check in every 5 days to ensure that polices are maintained on the device.<p>In short, Dropbox is a fantastic personal consumer product. We're aiming at the corporate market, it's almost like a CMS for iPad.<p>BTW, you're right on the money with the ""one month free"" versus ""free plan"", we'll fix that right up!<p>Thanks for your feedback, I really appreciated it.<p>Cheers,<p>Marcus (@Schappi)",1311773847

It's not. Takeout lets you grab all of your social information. Any popular desktop mail client can connect to Gmail over IMAP and automatically download every last e-mail in your account. I click one checkbox on Google Docs and then hit download to have a backup, or I can connect through WebDAV using a popular FTP client. There are similar easy solutions for Picasa, Calendar, and the rest. Just because they don't provide you with one shiny big button to do all the work for you doesn't mean they don't provide you with very accessible ways to backup your data offline.<p>At the end of the day, an automated system did what it was designed to do.

The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned. But neither the United States nor any State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.""",1311772459

If you can buy your account from the website without talking to an account manager, and the plans are as low as $9/month, you should not expect a lot of performance, features, locations, etc.: what you should, however, expect is &quot;cheap&quot;... MaxCDN is appropriately cheap.<p>To look at something more reasonable: CDNetworks is realistic competition; they are strong in Asia, and were the people I was comparing the pricing to (so they aren&#x27;t going to be horribly expensive). According to the comparison website you are using, they have almost four times as many edge locations.<p><a href=""http://www.cdnplanet.com/compare/cloudfront/cdnetworks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdnplanet.com/compare/cloudfront/cdnetworks/</a><p>Honestly, though, the reality is that the really great CDNs don&#x27;t even have data on this website (even for CDNetworks I think this data is not accurate: looks like an approximation): the leaders in this space are Akamai and Limelight, and both just show &quot;Not Available&quot; for the number of edge nodes they have.<p>Even going a little lower on the CDN pecking list, though: Level3, which according to this website you are using is mostly &quot;competitive&quot; with CloudFront (sometimes actually worse) in the regions CloudFront bothers to cover, is clearly covering <i>entire subcontinents</i> where CloudFront has nothing.<p>The reality is that CloudFront is still trying to grow out a network: they have poor coverage in Europe (which is pretty key), a few nodes in Japan/Singapore, and then next to no coverage anywhere else. Yet, they insist on pricing their product as if they were a big player (12c/GB is Akamai-level expensive).<p>(So, do I get to condescendingly say &quot;this is nonsense&quot; now? I mean, seriously: you clearly didn&#x27;t spend much time using this website and you didn&#x27;t look into who the leaders are to verify you weren&#x27;t comparing low-end to low-end... also, I think you are not appreciating that 0->2 is infinitely better ;P.)",1394023872

And I&#x27;m showing my ignorance of frameworks in general, implying that Bootstrap is the Inventor of all Breakpoints (though I don&#x27;t consider using Bootstrap bad at all, just that its default handling of iPad is similar to the BBC&#x27;s beta).<p>I guess I just suspect that news editors/execs are jumping too quickly on the &quot;mobile-first&quot; and &quot;above the fold doesn&#x27;t matter in cyberspace&quot; movements...not that either of them are bad, but neither do they universally apply. I&#x27;m just not convinced that this kind of 2-column view (a smidgen wider than the iPad-portrait-breakpoint) would be a problem to squeeze into the iPad portrait, or even iPad mini:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/mT220OG.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/mT220OG.png</a><p>Whatever it&#x27;s awkwardness at full-desktop view, to me, that would be just about perfect for the tablet view. Could you shed some light on any analytics insight that&#x27;s informed the process? For example, I suspect (but haven&#x27;t ever counted) that the majority of stories I click through on the NYTimes home page were <i>not</i> in the center well or top headlines:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/UC6VnRn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/UC6VnRn</a><p>On the frontpage today, I&#x27;d be more likely to click on the E-cigarettes story, maybe the charter schools story, and most definitely the top list of Ramen restaurants...none of which would be top-site news (E-Cigarettes may take the center stage during the afternoon). But if war in Ukraine broke out? I&#x27;d probably click on the massive site-wide headline that the NYT would probably use. I like whitespace and sparseness, but I just don&#x27;t think it plays particularly well to news sites&#x27; strengths and weaknesses...especially the weaknesses of the content-management side (which is obviously not in the control of your team, but is inevitably a factor to deal with at most news sites).",1394023776

It&#x27;s suggested donation.<p>The challenge is the first time you go has to be for a full ten days. No reading, writing, or talking. The idea is you are a monk for ten days. I had never meditated before. I showed up with comfortable clothes and toiletries and they took care of everything else. Very challenging, but as rewarding and life-changing as anything I&#x27;ve done.<p>I wrote up my experiences -- <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/vipassana-meditation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/vipassana-meditation</a>, <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/goenka-10-day-meditation-retreats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/goenka-10-day-meditation-retreats</a>, and <a href=""http://joshuaspodek.com/jumping_for_joy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joshuaspodek.com/jumping_for_joy</a> -- for more background.<p>EDIT: copying from the first link to save a click (losing the formatting, sorry):<p>A reader emailed me about mindfulness and self-awareness. I mentioned to him a meditation retreat I did a few years ago and found an old post I wrote about the experience, answering another reader’s questions about the course.<p>I did a ten day Vipassana course a few years ago.<p>What it’s about: It teaches you a meditation technique and gives you the time and space to practice it. It’s based on buddhist beliefs. We meditated for 8-10 hours per day for ten days. That’s basically it. You aren’t supposed to read, write, gesture, etc, except to ask the instructor questions. They provide food and instruction on what to focus on.<p>Was it hard: Yes, it was hard. The first couple days were painful while getting used to sitting still for so long. I started getting comfortable by the second day. Ten days is a long time (the place I went in Massachusetts required your first session be ten days) so it’s a mental challenge.<p>Keep in mind, thousands of people have done it. It’s hard, but anyone can do it. You just have to persevere.<p>Main benefits: Some people had profound, life-changing positive experiences, understanding more about themselves and their perception of the world around them. Some people go regularly. On the other hand, some people left early. I found the experience positive.<p>The main benefits were a better understanding of my priorities in life, calmness, less attachment to things, more freedom. I haven’t meditated much since then, but I do sometimes, and I keep many of the benefits. I’ll probably go again for shorter sessions periodically.<p>I later added<p>By the way, I don’t like religion, so I didn’t like some of the buddhist stuff, but no one else I talked to had a problem with it. I guess I’m more sensitive to religion than most. You can generally ignore the religious part if you want and just get the technique. I did, anyway.<p>and<p>Regarding location, I don’t think it would make that much of a difference. My eyes were closed to meditate around ten hours a day, sleeping seven or eight hours a night, meals in an eating room. There is not much room for variation. Nor should there be. All one needs is quiet.",1394023573

What gets less attention is why.  I know in my own code there are dependencies I know very, very well.  Some of them I have helped to author.  Some of them I have helped with regarding maintenance programming later.  But there are many which I don&#x27;t.<p>There are a bunch of reasons for this:<p>1.  Code has varying degrees of readability and is easily comprehensible to various extents.  Code which reads like a book gets more time than that which I have to figure out its structure first.<p>2.  Code that is well maintained provides less necessity to add someone else.  I tend to be more likely to read poorly maintained code than well maintained code, for example because bugs don&#x27;t get fixed is a good reason to try to fix them myself....",1394023201

Some bugs are generally easy to resolve with one-line fixes (the Apple SSL bug being a good idea).<p>2.  Some bugs are genuinely deep because they are design limitations of the software, or flawed assumptions on the part of the person who designed the software contract.<p>Now let&#x27;s also point out that bugs of the second class may have an apparent shallow fix which in fact simply paper over deeper problems.  A bug fix needs to resolve the issue, not just provide some cruft to make life immediately easier.<p>Certainly if you see Linux push back on patches, you see he is pretty heavily aware of that fact.<p>There are two things I have learned on this topic in my time as a programmer.  The first is that the only really deep bugs are those which are design flaws.  The second is that review in advance prevents problems, not eyes on the problems in retrospect.<p>You can&#x27;t turn a deep bug into a shallow bug after it is already there.  By the time you have beta testing going on it is too late.  What you can do is have a few good people who design things well (and review eachothers&#x27; work there) and then deep bugs don&#x27;t happen as frequently.",1394021603

All were really different and I felt like I had to scramble just to not get &quot;caught&quot; in how unprepared I was. Every one of my jobs since has been like that, each one a big move up in complexity, pay, and skill of my teammates.<p>As soon as you are the best developer on your team, chances are you&#x27;ll get comfortable and stop growing. I think the most important skill I have right now is a powerful flexibility that comes from a broad set of experiences working in a variety of languages, frameworks, and domains. In six years I&#x27;ve written and maintained code professionally in: Perl, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, VB6, VB.NET, C#, and F#. And I&#x27;ve worked in banking, educational kids games, magazine printing and sales, event tracking, and school financial aid.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think you&#x27;re flexible and adaptable if you&#x27;ve only ever learned one language and you are comfortable where you are. I&#x27;ve known and hired developers who were supremely confident in their adaptability (but only had a lot of experience in one place) who, upon moving from a &quot;level 1&quot; job in x language to a &quot;level 2&quot; job in y were broadsided with things as simple as syntax, in some cases quitting to go somewhere else to make less! Or like one guy I worked with, he loved Python and would constantly talk up how great it was and better than .NET. I finally said, &quot;great, I love Python, let&#x27;s do something in it!&quot; We got about twenty minutes in when he realized Python is duck typed and decided Python sucked.<p>The problem with both of them is they&#x27;d really only ever worked in one language doing things one way for the same amount of time I&#x27;d worked three different jobs, and they didn&#x27;t know how to adapt and be uncomfortable.",1394021262

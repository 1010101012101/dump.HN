7815745,comment,7813396,7815727,2,0,Tyrannosaurs,,,"From a company perspective the reason is you may well be missing out on great talent and the great teams that research shows come with greater diversity.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with affirmative action, but if you believe that many of the factors which contribute towards easily measured ability (attending a good school, work experience) may be skewed, then you presumably also accept that there is untapped potential out there - people with the ability to be as great but who have been in some way - fairly or otherwise - disadvantaged.<p>In IT in particular, where everything changes rapidly, you want to be hiring for potential as much as skill the candidate has today.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about picking someone because they&#x27;re part of a minority, it&#x27;s about thinking about how you look for and judge candidates to take into account that potential which so far hasn&#x27;t been tapped.",1401364765

7815726,comment,7815443,7815641,9,0,fmstephe,,,"I am curious about your definition of wait-free and lock-free. There are a number of conflicting definitions for these two terms floating around the internet.<p>If we take a very simple problem, incrementing a shared counter and doing some other work and returning its new value. In pseudo-code (with no exception handling).<p>---\nA lock based solution would look like this<p><pre><code>    public void inc() {\n        this.l.lock()\n        this.value++\n        this.l.unlock()\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis has the crucial property that if a thread gets descheduled by the OS while it holds the lock no other thread can make progress until that thread has been restored and releases the lock. Importantly this is true whether we use user space spin locks or OS integrated locks.<p>---\nA lock-free solution would look like<p><pre><code>    public void inc() {\n        while(!compareAndSet(&this.value, this.value+1))\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis has the charming property that if a thread gets descheduled by the OS anywhere inside this method other threads will not be impacted. However, there is a pathological case where a single thread may repeatedly fail the call to compareAndSet(...). While this does mean that some other thread(s) must be making progress an unlucky thread may be delayed indefinitely.<p>---\nA wait-free solution for this on x64 would look like<p><pre><code>   public void inc() {\n        // do some inline assembly\n        XADD this.value 1\n        // that&#x27;s enough assembly\n   }\n</code></pre>\nwhere the XADD instruction is guaranteed to always work atomically and safely regardless of how many other threads are also xadding to the same address. In practice wait-free algorithms are exceptionally complex and often slower than their lock-free counterparts. Wait-free techniques are most popular with academics (because they are so hard :) and with hard real-time systems because you can&#x27;t risk failing indefinitely on a contended compareAndSet(...).<p>This is a good explanation of what I understand to be lock-free and wait-free<p><a href=""http://rethinkdb.com/blog/lock-free-vs-wait-free-concurrency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rethinkdb.com/blog/lock-free-vs-wait-free-concurrency...</a><p>Here is a really good discussion about it<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mechanical-sympathy/Tm3xRcvpnzE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mechanical-sympathy/...</a><p>Truly no flame intended.

7815708,comment,7815419,7815419,15,0,EvanMiller,,,"This is a good discussion, but the author is confused about what the &quot;Low Base Rate Problem&quot; is. It doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the null hypothesis being true most of the time -- the example the author gives is actually a second form of repeated significance testing, which could be addressed with a Bonferroni or Šidák correction.<p>The Low Base Rate Problem is when you have a binary outcome and one of the outcomes is rare (say, less than 1%). There is so little entropy in the information source that you have to acquire a heck of a lot of samples in order for the statistical test to have any power. The problem is not unique to frequentist statistics; it&#x27;s a consequence of information theory and so it affects Bayesian statistics as well.<p>Nonetheless, I highly recommend examining Bayesian test techniques to avoid repeated significance testing (both within a single trial and across multiple trials). A side benefit is that when someone says &quot;What&#x27;s the probability that the new purple dragon logo outperforms the old one?&quot;, you can give them an answer without backpedaling and explaining null hypotheses, p-values, significance levels, and all that jazz.<p>The major drawback to Bayesian techniques is that it tends to be computationally expensive. For example, to evaluate the A/B test and answer the purple-dragon question with normal priors, you have to integrate a normal distribution in two directions, and there&#x27;s not a clean analytic formula for that. That&#x27;s why there&#x27;s a jagged histogram in the blog post; it changes every time you hit &quot;Calculate&quot; because it&#x27;s being integrated with Monte Carlo techniques, which take a lot of juice compared to (frequentist) analytic methods.",1401363656

All this just resonated with me and it comes from a desire to help, not criticize!)<p>> You don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to be in my shoes. To be extremely lonely with no friends. To have nothing but your intelligence to keep you company. To change your patterns of living, the places you eat, and the paths you walk, just to avoid certain social situations. To stay confined to one place for a while because to get to where you want to be, you have to pass through an anxiety-zone to get there.<p>I know what&#x27;s it like to be in your shoes. You&#x27;re describing me, or at least who I have been for a long time, to a tee! I can elaborate, but suffice it to say it&#x27;s pretty much as you describe. It even made me consider suicide for a while.<p>But more importantly, <i>tons</i> of people know what it&#x27;s like (especially in this corner of the world).<p>It&#x27;s just that 1) we&#x27;re not very visible in popular culture on account of it not being that interesting to watch an episode of a guy sit at a computer by himself, and 2) lonely people, by definition, don&#x27;t meet lonely people.<p>A very, <i>very</i> common and <i>very</i> harmful  defense mechanism that I&#x27;ve seen and experienced is to blame others for this, and to develop a sense of arrogance (&quot;nothing but your intelligence&quot;). While this is understandable, I think it&#x27;s completely untrue and most importantly: it&#x27;s utterly pointless. Even <i>if</i> it&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s not going to change how you feel, it&#x27;s not changing anything and, worse, will make you focus on these negative emotions.<p>It&#x27;s a downward spiral. Your resentment or anger prevents you from seeing those instances where people <i>do</i> reach out, because you&#x27;re too busy feeling bad for yourself. The arrogance you develop as a defense mechanism (however subconscious this process might be) makes you insufferable, and, well, that&#x27;s what we call a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>And you know what? Even <i>that</i> is utterly common. There are tons of very social people who exactly the way you do: lonely, bitter, angry, and entitled/arrogant. It&#x27;s just that their particular spiral just looks different: they might become drama kings or queens, and they flit from friendship to friendship and relationship to relationship because nobody can stand them in the long run.<p>Now let me be less harsh and comment as constructively as I can on some specific things you say that stand out to me:<p>> We can&#x27;t hit you. Then you turn around and think you can slap me? Please. Don&#x27;t slap me or I&#x27;m going to be really tempted to slap you back.<p>As a rule, I don&#x27;t hit girls. There are all sorts of good reasons why this rule is good. But there have been few occasions, few and far between, where I warned a repeat-hitter (of the non-playful style of hitting) to cut it out or I&#x27;ll hit her back, &#x27;conventions&#x27; be damned. And it&#x27;s happened that I did physically restrain or push a girl after she&#x27;d continue to be abusive.<p>Now, I never outright hit a woman, but that&#x27;s because it was never necessary. Maybe one day I might hit a woman. But you know what? It&#x27;s not relevant. It never happens, as I don&#x27;t hang around women who punch me. If you do, then stop doing that.<p>But letting that happen and making conclusions about &#x27;women&#x27; seems like a bit of a silly thing to do. It&#x27;s like concluding all black people are thieves because you decide to walk around in a gang-area with money flapping out of your pockets.<p>But it does fit in the victim-role that I&#x27;ve once taken on, for understandable reasons, and that you might find yourself taking on currently.<p>> Women can be ruthless. It&#x27;s not just men.<p>Yes, they&#x27;re human, and a lot of humans are shitty excuses for humans. But I know very few people who think otherwise, and that includes people who are bit too far on the militant feminism side of things. And again, why not just avoid people who claim that women are <i>not</i> ruthless.<p>> And a lot of this is that I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t. I am horrible socially.<p>You probably are. So was I, and I still am in many ways. That&#x27;s why I like to spend a lot of days alone with a computer, or the comfortably-distant company of people on IRC or Hacker News. That way I can think about my responses and not feel anxious.<p>The moment I realized that <i>it is okay to be an introvert or loner</i>, I became much happier. And as a result I found it easier to go out and learn to socialize and deal with my anxiety find a balance. I will always be more anxious kind of person, but that is why I seek out people who suit me in that way. Other geeks are great for that.<p>But acceptance is key to this, and resentment and arrogance keep you from accepting yourself, and then figuring out how else you could be.<p>> When will being a beta male be OK?<p>Go to a tech meetup. A programming camp. Stuff like that. Talk to a psychologist. The world is filled with beta males and nobody cares. Nice people care that you are <i>nice</i>, and even plenty of &#x27;alpha&#x27; males, hot and social girls, and whatnot, can enjoy the company of nice beta-males. I&#x27;ve experienced that, and it still surprises me sometimes that once you&#x27;re out of the high-school clique-mentality, we nerds can offer a lot to others.<p>Once I lost my anger and resentment, and decided to accept my nerdy, anxious, socially-inept selp, I gradually became the guy people wanted to be friends with. The guy who you talk to about serious stuff. The guy who gets carried away by some nerdy topic, but isn&#x27;t that kinda funny and interesting and you can just tell him to shut up already and watch the football. The guy who girls of many varieties like because he&#x27;s got a mind that he likes to use, and despite his oddness, he <i>cares</i> about them and <i>respects</i> them (and even alpha males need nerd-love!).<p>> And I have to take you out, pay for your dinner, and your concert tickets [etc.]<p>No you don&#x27;t. Part of the problem is that you don&#x27;t really know what you &#x27;have&#x27; to do, on account of being so stuck in your notions of what this &#x27;outside&#x27; world is like. If I&#x27;m on a date, I usually split the bill. Or I pay if I feel like it and if I like the girl enough to conform to &#x27;conventions&#x27; that might exist.<p>If she cares that I don&#x27;t pay, that&#x27;s the last date.<p>Just to be clear, I could be off about you. I&#x27;m just trying to interpret what you&#x27;re saying. But if you don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m being accurate, my apologies. I&#x27;m just sharing this out of frustration over having seen so many people get lost in loneliness (or even depression or homelessness) for precisely the reasons I describe.<p>The core mechanism is simple:<p>1. person can&#x27;t &#x27;function&#x27; in a way they themselves desire, for a variety of reasons (mental issues, personality, personal history, etc).\n2. person gets understandably sad and frustrated and lonely, and nobody seems to care\n3. person develops a constant feeling of inferiority and failure, and their mind shields them from this through inflated ego, arrogance, entitlement, controlling behavior, extreme introspection (leading to a false &#x27;understanding&#x27; of the world) and a variety of other defense mechanisms. \n4. these two seemingly opposite things interact to both confirm his negative feelings, and further destroy his sense of self-worth and self-acceptance.<p>The only way out is to suck it up, seek professional help, learn to be a nice person, learn to comfortably reject shitty people (as a result of having the self-worth and awareness to do so), and avoid especially the isolating, &#x27;I am a special snowflake&#x27; type of thinking, again and again.<p>I can still fall into the snowflake trap, as I am a self-involved human like anyone else. But it&#x27;s easier for me to get out of that now by remembering that I am not alone, my problems are <i>shockingly</i> common, and that everyone needs good people to offset the shit that happens. Trying to be such a good person, and finding help for my particular problems, has make me so much happier than I&#x27;ve been for most of my life.<p>> I&#x27;m just so tired of everyone yelling this, that, and the other thing, and missing the picture that is mental illness<p>You (and I) might have legitimate issues, but the only purpose of labeling them as illness is if we go and find a cure. Otherwise we&#x27;re just emotional hypochondriacs.",1401363244

7815677,comment,7807710,7808872,1,0,gjm11,,,"(Mathematician at Light Blue Optics here.)<p>Unfortunately that near-100%-efficiency wasn&#x27;t quite realised in practice, for several reasons. I think I can describe some of them without giving away anything commercially sensitive:<p>1. The spatial light modulator we used didn&#x27;t give anything like the 180 degrees of phase rotation outlined there, which means that a large fraction of the light landing on it passed straight through.<p>2. Having only two phase states leads, as mentioned in that page, to a conjugate image with as much light in it as the one we actually want.<p>3. All that random noise does indeed average out nicely when you have many &quot;subframes&quot;. But since there&#x27;s no such thing as negative light, parts of the image that are meant to be black will inevitably end up something other than black. So there&#x27;s a loss of contrast, which means that some of the light in the image isn&#x27;t really doing you much good.<p>4. The optical design has a bunch of lenses and mirrors and things in it, and every surface is an opportunity to lose a little bit of light.<p>The actual optical efficiency figure was, let&#x27;s say, somewhat less than 100%. (Also, for every frame we displayed we had to compute a lot of Fourier transforms, and the compute hardware takes power too. Which wouldn&#x27;t matter for large mains-powered projectors, but is more of an issue when you&#x27;re trying to make a small low-power device for mobile use.)<p>We had some next-generation technology in the works that would (if brought to completion) have fixed most of these issues and produced better efficiency along with better image quality -- but then we made the (very sensible) decision to get out of the picoprojection market completely.",1401362495

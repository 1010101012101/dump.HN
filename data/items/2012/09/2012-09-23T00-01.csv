No amount of foreign aid and wishful thinking will change this fact. You say that it is ""on the verge of economic security and prosperity"" with the government wanting to ""develop respectable and effective network infrastructure that would support the local people"", yet you conveniently leave out the fact that Zimbabwe, as Rhodesia, already had all of these things. Whites created economic security, prosperity, and an overall infrastructure which supported everyone, including blacks. It wasn't perfect, just like in South Africa, but it worked, and it did so due to Whites applying their knowledge and creativity to solve hard problems. The current majority, over the last few decades, has been slowly dismantling the civilization which Whites created, while simultaneously drastically increasing the amount of foreign aid the country now needs.",1348361642

Instead of tech worker demand driving infrastructure, it has simply created a separate (but equal?), exclusive, mirror transit system.<p>Also an example of complete and utter urban planning failing on the part of the city of San Francisco. A large part of why companies don't set up shop in SF proper (despite the bulk of their work force wanting to live there), is due to the complete lack of development. Rents, both commercial and residential, are completely out of control and it actively drives away business. Meanwhile SF has completely crossed off new development in large swathes of the city - including pretty much the entire downtown commercial core.<p>SF is a vibrant, innovative, creative population subsisting on the surface of a government that is firmly hanging onto antiquated notions of the 19th century, not even the 20th, and this conflict has reached epic proportions of ridiculousness.

Population dynamics are complex. Things often seem inexhaustible until they're not and that changes has a nasty habit of happening almost overnight. Look at the Passenger Pigeon, the Alaskan King Crab, bison, various whale species (some may never recover from the whaling industry), cod, etc.<p>I think this is exacerbated by it being hard to tell what exactly is in the ocean. With land animals it <i>tends</i> to be somewhat more obvious.<p>Some governmental oddities haven't helped here. Britain really screwed up in how it joined the EU (then the EEC) in the 1970s with the CFP (Common Fisheries Policy) [1], which is (now) a textbook case of the tragedy of the commons.<p>Norway didn't join. And they're swimming in oil wealth. Not that I think oil fields would've become a common resource (the North Sea oil fields aren't AFAIK).<p>And then there's the insatiable appetite of the Japanese for bluefin tuna that will probably drive the fish to extinction in a matter of decades at most.<p>IMHO all of these resource problems stem from the fact that there are simply too many of us and we're unable to live within our means.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.global-vision.net/facts/fact9_3.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.global-vision.net/facts/fact9_3.asp</a>",1348361494

First, even if an attacker can wiretap my network, and I assume that at least my ISP and government always can, I want my main means of communication to be secure: I PRETEND HTTPS on mail, Twitter, Facebook and so also on WhatsApp before using it. (Also, with https it's not hard, it must not be possible, if it is, is a bug)
Second, if you try airodump-ng in a public place you will realize that you don't wiretap a Wi-Fi MAC address, it is screamed in every direction by every device that have Wi-Fi turned on, and note, not associated to an AP, simply turned on. Because this is how the network works, your device keeps yelling ""I am /MAC address/ and know these APs, is there anyone near?""

What doesn't work great are the absolute pieces of crap that Seagate and Western Digital are pawning off on us as viable backup solutions. They are just plain garbage. The controllers are unstable, and the drives are invariably refurbished. (And don't even get me started on the 2.5"" drives with embedded USB controllers and no access to SATA ports.)<p>I went through a couple Seagates and a couple WD's, each of which would corrupt the Time Machine volume repeatedly. The last straw came when I had an internal drive failure on my MBP, and my existing Time Machine drive would not even mount, and Disk Warrior, Drive Genius, and TechTool Pro (in that order) were of no help.<p>I switched to using a Thermaltake USB3 dock, with 3.5"" WD Enterprise drives. I have not had a single issue since. You get what you pay for in hard drives. If you are relying upon them for backup - don't go cheap. It isn't worth it!",1348358906

For employers wishing to reserve a certain number of seats on specific buses at certain times, RidePal plans to sell subscriptions, starting at $250 a month for companies of up to 50 people. That subscription is credited toward fares, which start at $8 a seat for trips within a 10-mile zone and go up to $589 for a monthly pass within the largest travel zone, which extends up to 75 miles from the pickup location.

There will be a mental revolution for those who believe in this, because the rest of the world believes we are already in a revolution.. Stop being negative, make room for the people who are ready to innovate. Quit hating, in less words. There are generations who are adapting to this new environment, even if they don't realize it.<p>I'd say this: stop focusing on the negative and start being creative-- this article is just a bunch of bullshit excuses that will in itself slow innovation. Feed the hungry, don't kick them when they are down. ""We"" young entrepreneurs need inspiration now more than anything, not criticism. Big ideas are going to happen, regardless of you believing in them (yet).<p>The tools we all have access to is unbelievable. If you don't feel like the future is already here, and it's just prime time to start making the new generation of innovations using these tools, you're going to be left in the dust.<p>Innovation never goes anywhere it just needs time to adapt, I think.<p>Come and see me 5-10 years from now, and maybe I can say I told you so.",1348358693

Last year, global fish consumption hit a record high of 17 kg (37 pounds) per person per year, even though global fish stocks have continued to decline. On average, people eat four times as much fish now than they did in 1950.""<p>This news report is consistent with many other studies I have seen of this issue since the 1980s.

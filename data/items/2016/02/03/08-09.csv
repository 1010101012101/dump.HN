It is a little wordy but lays it down pretty well. I&#x27;m not affiliated with them, but do heavily research this space, and the larger ecosystem. I found it pretty well rounded.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this articles 10 question list really covers the scope of what microservice means. For reference, I&#x27;m not talking about ~5 microservices here (as that might be trivial), but am thinking in the scope of ~50-100+. In that you should have a pretty good reason to adopt them re: your team size and scale of operations. You can see an increased rate of deployed changes, performance boosts, and freedom to choose languages that fit the problem, but it comes with additional operational complexity. In that, you will pay an upfront tax for using microservices. So, you really need to think about asking yourself these types of questions (and the ones in the article).<p>- How and where should you break things into microservices (if monolith)?<p>- Who should own the microservice? What does this mean in terms of coding, testing, deploying, ops issues, etc?<p>- You will need team buy in. A switch could mean months of work. The upside is massive but you cannot push this on them.<p>- How do you deal with things at the datastore level (can/should two microservice access the same table space)?<p>- How are you going to deploy microservice via CI/CD pipeline into your production env?<p>- How do microservices communicate (RPC, API, etc)?<p>- What type of metrics do you build into your microservice?<p>- How can you trace requests when they hit multiple microservices?<p>- You&#x27;ll need to beef up your operations tools to manage these microservices too. What does that look like?<p>These are pretty fundamental things you need to think about and the book does a pretty decent job at explaining it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033158.do</a>",1454489085

If I wake up in the weekend in the same bed, I&#x27;m acting differently than during the week. Moreover I am easily think of a scenario in which I wake up in my bed on a raft on the ocean.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any connectionist framework that comes close. 1) Polychronization doesn&#x27;t tell how to connect groups. 2) Global workspace theory is &quot;homogeneous&quot; connectionist.

Isolate certain functionality in a separate process, sandbox it with OS-provided solutions like seccomp-bpf or capsicum, make it terminate on a violation, design its API to be idempotent so you can just restart the process on failure. Have rlimits on process memory usage. There are technical solutions and development processes to write better, more secure software.<p>The problem is of course that software has to be designed for this, it&#x27;s not something that can easily be slapped on as an afterthought. It demands more of the design, and that&#x27;s not easy to motivate in most organisations.

I don&#x27;t consider it taxing at all<p>I have no doubts that you find learning fun and find it easy, but the last sentence I&#x27;m a little hesitant with. It reminds me of a single pane comic strip I recently saw. It was of a business man receiving a logo from a designer, and he said, &quot;Why should I pay you $X dollars for a logo you designed in ten minutes?&quot;. To which the artist replied, &quot;It took me ten years to get that quick at making logos.&quot; Learning the art of software development is similar, you need to get a solid foundation in your domain of knowledge before you can build anything both well and quickly or before you start to find things easier to figure out.<p>I would like to stress that programming is very hard and taxing when you are completely new to it and it progressively gets easier and easier. I only was recently re-informed of how hard programming is as I have recently helped my brother begin programming, because like you for the most part I find it relatively simple to learn something new. Though I find it easy to learn I notice when I first dive into a new framework, language, or codebase I do have to watch my stress levels and make sure I&#x27;m not getting overwhelmed by it.<p>>I mean, come on, in the grand scheme of things, developers are wizards who never have to be worried about 90% of the things other people in the world have to worry about. These finer qualities of career enjoyment are nice-to-haves, not necessities.<p>If by wizards you mean everything they do seems like magic to everyone who has never written any code and themselves and their methods are often misunderstood I would say that is true, and I think that may be part of the problem. Though some might oppose it I think the idea of educating more people in CS in grade schools might help combat that.<p>To the second sentence, I would say everyone has their own measurement of what a necessity and a nice-to-have is, but often most things people complain about aren&#x27;t completely necessary. You can tell he (the blog poster) has a problem with the way things are being done at his company I appreciated his opinion although I don&#x27;t necessarily take his stance.",1454486813

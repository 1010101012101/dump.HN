At the period of time when word came to dominate there were no wysiwyg TeX tools and it was a real pain to include figures and images.  Output formatting mattered if you were submitting a conference paper, but the other 99.999% of the population cared more about being able to get simple tasks done easily.",1215651531

You should send something their way just in case.<p>As far as using that stuff for algorithmic purposes goes, I think they mostly are interpreted as proof that what exists is actually working (and thus doesn't need tweaking?). Also, depending on your demographic, certain types of testimonials are less appealing. Not sure if OkCupid is still courting the youngsters, but if they are marriage stories (as awesome as they are) may serve to scare away a profitable demographic, advertising-wise.",1215651507

We agree that what FSF calls ""free"", and what RMS so piously lectures us all about, has at least one substantive restriction.  My definition of ""free"" (as in speech, as the Righteous and Holy FSF puts it) includes no substantive restrictions.<p>I think the Stallman's definition of ""free"" basically amounts to extortion on some level.

241840,comment,241603,241821,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Perhaps, I don't know that much about it. The overall problem though is with legal precedent, as I feel it puts businesses in a no-win situation. What if you're a small business owner, say of a video rental store, and the White House asks you for records? Your options are:<p>1. Comply<p>2. Start spending serious money on legal advice.<p>Suppose your lawyer says not to do it without a warrant (which he probably would.) Then what? You risk fighting the White House in court? You could suck up a lifetime of a video store's revenue doing this. You'd probably waste a couple weeks of profit just to pay the retainer to get that advice in the first place. You, a small business owner, the keystone of our economy, with a family to feed and kids to put through college, should have to pay a significant amount of money to help police our government?<p>Even for a large telecom that can afford the legal bills, they're putting shareholder money at risk to fight an ethical battle by refusing to meet the White House's demands. They might be risking shareholder lawsuits for that. Either way, they're screwed.<p>The way I see it, we as a society have two reasonable options.<p>1) This sort of oversight should come from the government itself, or at least somehow be publicly funded. or<p>2) Corporations should never be penalized for following a government issued order. Of course, if it turns out that order was illegal (as in the case of this wiretapping) the government agencies and employees involved should be the ones held at fault. Not the business that merely complied with the government.",1215650677

That is, it's not what's better for the users/property owners (think fascism) but what's better for the software itself, as an entity (think democracy.)

241837,comment,241177,241753,0,0,dejb,,,"Actually this is not correct. The perfect unbeatable game theoretical model actually doesn't take into consideration the history of the other player. There's maths and stuff by John Nash to prove this. The game theory perfect model will always play as if it is playing a perfect opponent.<p>In way you could say that the mathematically perfect player is so on guard against tricks by an opponent that even after 20 consecutive raises by an opponent it still doesn't alter its strategy. Of course the strategy will not lose just because a player raises once and consequently it also won't lose to a player who raises all the time. However by doing this the algorithm will miss out on substantial chances to exploit an imperfect opponent's weaknesses (in this case being way too aggressive). As a poker pro there is a (small) chance this 'perfect' player wouldn't even beat the rake against fish. However it would not lose (on average) to the best player in the world (and would probably win).<p>This might all seem to go against your intuition and experience as someone who is probably a really good poker player but it has been mathematically proven as part of game theory. Of course finding/creating this 'perfect' playing strategy is probably more complicated than 'solving' chess which most people believe to be impossible.",1215650022

I can think of a few recent problems it might have have helped me think through.<p>The article advocates focusing on one slice of the program at a time to avoid apathy.

241822,comment,241702,241702,0,0,aston,,,"I used to work at OkCupid. I could talk to you at length about the ups and downs and ins and outs of online dating, but the moral of the story I gleaned from my time there can be summed up pretty easily:<p>People just want a <i>ton</i> of attractive/dateable people within a keyboard's reach, and if your site does any filtering on their behalf, people need to trust that it actually works.<p>Most of the variations in online dating sites focus on optimizing pieces of that. The big guys (Match.com, eHarmony) make sure they get huge user numbers by campaigning on national TV, and they apply some simple internal filters that are 'approved by a doctor.' Smaller sites can't compete with that, so concentrate more on making sure you only run into people you'd actually be attracted to (see JDate). OkCupid's on the smaller side, and focuses on community building (for numbers) and uses mathematically semi-sound calculation coupled with quiz questions to create a user-driven but rigorous-feeling people filter. Basically everyone that's successful fits somewhere in that model.<p>If I were you, I would focus less on specific features or trying to build a better datetrap. Instead, figure out what it'll take for you to get fifty thousand people signed up, approximately all at the same time, and then how you'll keep the site growing over time. If you get big numbers, the dating stuff will follow (MySpace...).",1215648643

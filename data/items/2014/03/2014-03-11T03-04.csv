This may not be as big of a problem as it used to be a few years ago, but private trackers give you quite a bit more assurance that what you&#x27;re downloading is what is advertised. Also, since to be part of a private tracker you have to maintain the ratio, many users set up seedboxes and just leave their torrents on, while this doesn&#x27;t seem to happen quite as much on public trackers.",1394510380

You should have a service-oriented architecture for the necessarily private stuff. Anything infrastructural should eventually be planned for release into the open-source ecosystem.<p>That&#x27;s because maintenance is utterly necessary, but maintenance requires good people, and talented people will maintain OSS, because it benefits their reputations and usually involves improvements to infrastructure they need, but closed-source maintenance always ends up being a ball of work thrown onto people with the least clout, who are either not very good or pissed off.<p>That&#x27;s how you solve the SRE/SWE conflict you talked about.<p>Either that or you take the hedge fund strategy: pay people so goddamn well (hedonic adaptation says that&#x27;s in relative/growth terms, so 25% over market in the first year, and 25% growth <i>each</i> year) that they&#x27;ll be happy to do whatever you ask of them. But for an average $120k developer that has you over $1M/year after 10 years, and most tech companies aren&#x27;t willing to pay that.<p><i>You have a brilliant developer who is terrible at working with other people and doesn&#x27;t particularly want to deal with them. In an open-allocation world, he will end up shunned; nobody will want to work with him. In a managed org, it&#x27;s often possible for his manager to pick off a certain really difficult technical challenge, have him go off and find a solution, and then interface with the rest of the group via some technical API.</i><p>It&#x27;s actually the norm for the best team size, in software, to be one. There are exceptions, but not many.<p>In an open-allocation world, either he finds a project where he can contribute on his own, or he asks for suggestions (from someone like this manager). The difference is that he gets to pick (although if he doesn&#x27;t, he might have to be let go). He&#x27;s not reliant on <i>one</i> company-assigned manager (who might abuse the power) to be his interface.<p><i>In an open-allocation world, nobody will want to work with him, which means that he won&#x27;t be a tech lead for very long, and eventually he&#x27;ll probably get frustrated and leave.</i><p>I see no problem with that outcome.<p>If he&#x27;s not showing leadership, and no one follows him, that&#x27;s what <i>should</i> happen. If it bugs him, he can change his attitude or quit.<p>How many managers, in a closed allocation system, are actually going to know that a tech lead is taking the best work? This requires people on the team going to the manager (behind the tech lead&#x27;s back) and most people would be too afraid to do that, knowing what will happen if the manager names them to the tech lead.<p><i>You have a project where consistency is the whole benefit of the project. For example, you&#x27;re doing a company-wide visual redesign to make the company&#x27;s product offerings more consistent for users, or you&#x27;re introducing a language styleguide, or you&#x27;re defining standard APIs for communication between components. These efforts typically never succeed unless they have top-down support from a strong leader.</i><p>Ok, this one is a really good point. You&#x27;re right that this is something that requires top-down delivery of vision. It&#x27;s hard to imagine Steve Jobs running an open-allocation Apple. I think the benefits of open allocation in terms of <i>what people are allowed to work on an experiment with</i> are very strong. The fact is, though, that this can&#x27;t be taken so far as to allow people to impose complexity on the design or the ecosystem as a whole. You probably need centralized authority and vision to keep, for example, a simple product design. I don&#x27;t think that that should be an excuse to prevent people from organically forming and changing teams, though. It requires conservatism about what actually gets into the product, but not as much about how people work and what on.",1394509637

In a sea of crap, good content might glimmer on the surface, wherever it appears. There&#x27;s been a serious backlash among the tech and journalism communities against content farms and clickbait. People are, once again, experimenting with quality. Whether quality will be able to last depends on whether anyone can figure out how to make money from quality, and that&#x27;s the unfortunate truth of the matter. Meanwhile, content farming is a gravity well that seems to suck every new publication down into oblivion, slowly but inevitably. A tweak here, an optimization there, a formula plied and followed, and before you know it, you&#x27;re writing emotionally manipulative headlines and minimizing costs (and quality), like everyone else.

Be alert to pure, dumb luck when it happens, and willing to take advantage of it - including dropping previous plans - when appropriate.  I thought I would always work in small companies or startups, but I applied to Google in the depths of the 2008 recession and somehow was accepted, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been there 5 years, with a fairly generous option grant, and the stock price has quadrupled in that time.<p>2.) Always hone your skills so that when an opportunity arises, you can pounce.  I learned a lot of Javascript in my previous startup, and in 2008 (and now), that was the hot skill that everybody wanted.  Learn things even if you don&#x27;t know they&#x27;ll be useful, particularly things outside of your comfort zone; you never can tell what connection will be important in the future.<p>3.) Be curious about the world around you, and in particular, about what the people around you are doing.  Every single job I&#x27;ve had, I&#x27;ve gotten through my network.  In some cases, those connections were several years old, but I reached out and asked them what they were up to and it turned out what they were up to needed people.<p>4.)

Inorganic groups follow different rules entirely. They may fall into trust sparsity very quickly, or not at all despite scale.

Management has to address them in a fair way without becoming extortionist or meddling as one gets when the conflict of interest between people management and project management is unaddressed.<p>Open allocation isn&#x27;t a panacea. Open allocation has a million problems. So why do I advocate for it?

This typically premature optimization of closed allocation will usually create incidental complexity that becomes permanent and corrodes your company.<p>You might argue that VC-istan is open allocation, but with extreme (and unacceptable) social inequality, bizarre income effects that can damage future jobs, and reputation-based extortions that make it, nonetheless, dystopian.

Their website said it would come in a week but I waited for over 60 days before I finally told them to cancel the order. This was for their midrange server.<p>- They removed the ability to pay for less than a month because everyone was extending the rent on their old server until their new ones arrived. This was very scummy coming from OVH.<p>- Later I found out they were complaining about &quot;turnover&quot; even though when I asked support if I could upgrade my server, they said the only way to do that is to cancel the old server and get a new one.<p>- They removed e-mail support for Kimsufis even though some of them cost more than their new mid-range line that has it. Now they expect you to use a forum where responses have gone unanswered and everyone can see details on your server. They didn&#x27;t even reduce the price.<p>- There have been a few sporadic cases throughout the year where the server just lost connection to the internet for a minute.

Probably my tenth.  However, I got much better at avoiding the key mistakes:<p>- Always keep your highest number in a corner<p>- Use the rest of that edge as a &quot;staging area&quot; for the components that can next double the highest tile. Work the other tiles toward the opposite corner on that side and then double them upward into the highest corner.<p>- When you double the highest corner, you&#x27;ll expose the &quot;staging area&quot; side. During this time, quickly work number back to fill that side so you avoid being forced to move the highest number out.<p>- NEVER let yourself fill a 3x4 grid. This will force you to move the highest column away from the edge and will probably end the game in a handful of turns.",1394506864

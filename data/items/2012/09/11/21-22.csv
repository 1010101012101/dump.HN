Their problem was developing piece of shit apps that happened to use HTML5. They tasked amateurs who didn't know what they were doing into building a hybrid native app container which in turn embedded HTML5 content. Plenty of other developers (Instagram and LinkedIn come to mind) have figured out how to do that right, and in a way where it is seamless to the end user and for all intents and purposes feels exactly the same as a native app.<p>I'm not saying that it's an easy problem. You have to find the right balance between which components should be native or not. It's clear from the other problems that Facebook's been able to solve that they know how to hire top-notch developers. They just failed to do so for their mobile efforts, which just reinforces the stereotype that they don't ""get"" mobile.",1347400713

4507935,comment,4507889,4507889,2,0,geophile,,,"Dumb name, but I agree with the basic point. Mock objects are a deceptively good strategy, because they work for the toy examples used to motivate them, but don't scale up. The more sophisticated your tests get, the more you rely on real object behavior that isn't mocked accurately, and you end up spending too much time discovering this, or improving your mock object, (and likely introducing other bugs that your real system doesn't have).<p>Mocking a database is a really bad idea -- it is too easy to get transaction behavior subtly (or vastly) wrong, as mentioned; but also, there are subtleties involved in transaction isolation, sequences and auto-increment behavior, data types (especially fixed decimal and date/time), and functions.<p>Mocking distribution may be even worse. The failures simulated locally aren't quite the same as the real thing, timing is different, and it's easy to get subtle errors due to updates to shared state (that wouldn't be shared in a real distributed system).",1347400344

This is part rant part so you might want to stop reading:<p>- I send a recruiter my resume, they call me 20 seconds later and want to discuss it.  I took hours to write a damn good resume.  Read it, contact me with questions that ARE NOT answered by what I just sent you.  It's all laid out in front of you, stop wasting my time.<p>- How many years of experience do you have with product X?  Again, you can read the resume and add it up, not hard.<p>- Don't ask me to put other opportunities on hold or somehow make your opportunity exclusive.  If this was a perfect world where companies and recruiters got back to me with a yes/no in a day I would be fine with that, but expecting me to ignore 20 other e-mails when you never get back to me or take two weeks to schedule an interview is laughable.  If you want me, step up or step off.<p>- You contacted me about a position that's W2 and offers NO benefits?  Seriously?<p>- If you only send a location and job title it's going in the trash.<p>- If I don't respond to the initial or 2nd e-mail, I won't respond the 5th time you spam at me.<p>- I can tell that some recruiters are using me to simply fill their daily quota of sending e-mails.  All of my past job titles are related to Linux / UNIX and I mention EMC once so you're going to send me storage admin jobs?  Stop it.<p>- No need to tell me positions are ""urgent"" or have an ""immediate need"".  When it comes to hiring the need is always immediate, and when I see the word ""urgent"" it means OH GOD I HOPE I GET TO HIM FIRST I NEED MY COMMISSION.<p>- Oh, working with Product X is required and you only mention that after I send you the exact same resume you saw on a job site?  If it's not on my resume I haven't worked it it, stop wasting my time to fill your daily e-mail quotas.<p>- Stop creating hoops.  Bob gets my resume who sends it to his account manager Jane who sends it to Bill in HR who sends it to the supervisor John who sends it to the hiring manager Rick.  By the time my resume gets to Rick it's been 3 weeks and someone has already scooped me up.<p>- Stop with this subcontractor -> subcontractor -> outsourcing company -> outsourcing company -> actual client bullshit.  After all of these worthless middlemen get their cut the actual company ends up paying way way more than they would hiring directly.  My former (and very good natured) boss and I had a good laugh when we realized the company was paying almost twice as much for me as he made.<p>- Just because you have a branch office near me doesn't mean I want to drive down, fill out a bunch of paperwork, and waste an afternoon.<p>- Stop leaving me in the dark if you don't want me.  I can tell some contract houses are doing this intentionally because they don't want to submit me but also don't want me to try again with a competing contract house that WILL submit me.  Naughty, naughty.<p>- You expect me to spend a few hundred dollars to travel to your location for the 2nd, in-person interview?  Riiiiight.<p>- I've only talked with three recruiters that I actually like as people.  I resent the other 95% because they might be getting $10-20 for each hour I work just because they are keyword monkeys.<p>- Inefficient recruiting practices are driving away potential talent, period.

4507933,comment,4462864,4490775,0,0,lmm,,,"There's certainly some element of not expecting much from poor arab states. Yes, we do hold Israel to a higher standard than its neighbours - because it's richer, because it's seen as an extension of the US, and because it advertises and makes much of its status as the only democracy in the region. And there's probably at least some element of racism, but I think it's less a case of ""it's all the jews' fault"" and more ""these smart white folks have a burden the brown savages do not"".<p>>All other cases in WW I/II have been laid behind them by the victims, but this.<p>My instinct is to lay that at the feet of religion. Two violently opposed religions claiming the same areas as important holy sites makes peace hard.<p>>1. Is that measured for first time criminals only? It is a big step to risk jail.<p>AIUI it's been tested across criminals in general, not just first time.<p>>2. To simplify, there are two types of criminals. The first are the idiots that drink beer on a Saturday and get in a knife fight and the second type consider and weigh for/against like any other entrepeneur. How is the sentence length sensitivity if you ignore things like drunks that knife each others?<p>The thing is, ""crime doesn't pay"" isn't just a slogan, it's actually true. So the kind of smart people who evaluate the consequences usually end up following a different career. The only place it seems to me that it might make a difference would be the kind of grey area tax avoidance/fraud schemes, where the person is going to argue that what they did isn't a crime at all. But I don't think there would be much support for harsher sentencing of crimes that were only just on the wrong side of the law.<p>>3. Sentences have influence. A proof: If there was a death sentence for e.g. jay walking, not even I would do it (sober, see 2.). But -- I wouldn't jaywalk even if it was just one year in jail. In that way, there is no influence by sentence length -- is that how the claim is measured?<p>AIUI studies mostly look at crimes for which the sentencing guidelines were changed, or where different regions sentence differently, or statistically compare criminals who were given different sentences for the same crime. Obviously none of these methods are perfect.<p>I'll defer to you on psychopaths.<p>>- Hard drug users. The logical solution is not to give them short sentences if they aren't likely to have stopped the drugs -- for their own sake.<p>But prison is no good at getting them off the drugs or stopping them reoffending, unless you're going to lock them up forever to rot; what would a long prison sentence achieve that a short one wouldn't? Medical treatment and community service give them a better chance than prison - though still not a great one - at being able to reintegrate into society.<p>>- International crime syndicates -- see type two above (entrepeneur).<p>AIUI most of the inherently illegal income for crime syndicates comes from drugs, but it's hard to see how heavier sentencing would damage that income. Street-level dealers are easily replaceable and it's a pretty crappy job already, I don't think longer prison sentences would damage their recruitment. The executives usually stand to lose all their money and lifestyle if they're ever convicted (proceeds of crime and all that); they're banking on paying the right bribes and/or never getting caught.<p>AIUI you missed a third category of burglar: the independent ""professional"" who burgles because they're poor and have no skills with which to get a job. But while these guys do a bit better than drug addicts in prison (sometimes they're able to get some kind of qualification there - which is pretty much the only case where spending a longer time in prison will help), community service sentences still give them a better chance of not returning to crime.",1347400315

Part of their process of on-boarding was that I had to submit three current pay stubs. I protested and they assured me that it would not be used as a lever to drive down the already negotiated salary. I agreed to submit them, but I also included a poison pill stipulation that if they tried to negotiate salary after they where submitted that my salary requirement would go to 120% of what we negotiated. Sure enough they saw that I was making far less than what we negotiated and thought that they had leverage. They tried to reduce the offer by a little more than 25%. What they did not account for was that I had another offer that was only a little less than the original agreed upon rate. I stuck to the 120% poison pill, but accepted the offer from the other company, because even if they would have accepted the rate, the well was already fouled.",1347399753

4507902,comment,4501540,4507207,1,0,jcr,,,"It seems I omitted the well known problem with HTML-only emails. There\nare commonly used spam filtering rules (specifically, spam assassin, but\nalso Barracuda Networks and probably a lot of others) where sending\nHTML-only email adds to the (combined weight) probability of the message\nbeing marked as spam. In less pedantic terms, HTML-only counts against\nyou.  Depending on the weight given to the rule by the mail admin, the\nweight <i>can</i> be enough to automatically mark the message as spam\n(hypothetical kook config), but I haven't seen it weighted that high in\npractice.<p>As for the generation of multi-part MIME messages, this is <i>usually</i>\ndone by the creator of the email (the sending system/client), but\nthere's a caveat...<p>As a former calligrapher, I understand your love of typography. I know\nsome of the very simple and basic design aspects of using typography\nfor for more effective communication, but I haven't ever really studied\nit. A lot of the artistic effective design stuff goes over my head.<p>If you do use fonts (typefaces) in your HTML emails, it would be wise to\ninclude them as attachments (MIME parts) rather than access them from a\nremote server. The reason is simple; many HTML email rendering engines\nin MUA and web based email systems actively thwart ""web bugs"" in HTML\nemails.<p>A ""web bug"" is defined as any means of tracking if an email is opened,\nincluding all network traffic generated by accessing remote resources\n(like font files). If you used a font that resides on a server you\ncontrolled, you could track if the email was viewed by the recipient\nthrough your log files.<p>If an email message contains ""web bugs"", the <i>receiving</i> system and/or\nclient might create a defanged version of the message and either replace\nthe MIME part of the problematic version, or alternatively, add a new\nMIME part to the email that is then used for rendering.<p>Though you might think the defanging of ""web bugs"" is straight out of\nkook land, it's entirely real and very wide spread. All modern web mail\nimplementations and local email clients at least try to thwart remote\ntracking when rendering HTML emails.<p>Sadly, off the top of my head I'm unable to recall if a font file binary\ncan be embedded within the html source as textual data (i.e. like base64\nencoding of image data, favicons, etc.), but this might work. If not,\nyou'll need to manually add the fonts as attachments if they aren't\nautomatically attached by your email client/service.<p>In both the attachment and embedded data cases, you're now fighting with\nthe variance of HTML rendering support in browsers or email clients, so\ntesting to see if your fonts will render properly will be a whole lot of\nwork across a whole lot of systems/software.<p>Lastly, as you might imagine, giving away free copies of copyrighted\nfonts can result in substantial legal nightmares. When picking your\nfonts, you need to be really careful about the license terms of the\nfonts you use.<p>With a bit of effort, you can get what you want working on the majority\nof modern systems, and if you include a plain text version and the\nrequired fonts, you can also avoid most of the spam traps and similar\nproblems. Good luck with it!",1347399709

The money ensures that the sender is serious while not simply providing a platform for celebrity entrepreneurs to further enrich themselves (not what I had in mind while reading this guy's idea but an equally valid business model I suppose). As far as the sender and receiver are concerned the only thing the fee does is ensure that sender is serious about this email. You could just as easily collect the fee as the middle man and not distribute it to either.

Remember, people don't like feeling manipulated and paying a company to ""prove"" that you are serious about an email isn't something that would sit well with me.<p>The comparison I had in my mind is something along the lines of paying a fee to complete a bitcoin transaction. The fee is distributed to a ""charity"" of sorts (the bit coin miners) and goes toward making the world suck less (making sure the block chain is secure).

4507844,comment,4497461,4506941,1,0,gruseom,,,"I guess what you're arguing is that if YC funded too many startups, the bottom could fall out of the startup market the way it did in the mortgage market. Is that it? But the leverage thing is a huge difference. Another is the markets themselves. If the money in startups all comes from rare cases that pay off a million percent in a few years, well, mortgages surely don't work that way no matter how many layers of indirection the derivatives people concoct.<p>(Looking upthread, I wonder if your objection really is to the idea that more risk automatically means more reward, so therefore YC should fund 10x more. But clearly the argument is more subtle than that  otherwise, they should just fund everyone who asks them.)<p>Edit: I have another argument, or perhaps just article of faith: I think there's a major pool of unexploited talent out there, basically wasting away (mostly in corporate jobs) at far below its potential. If many more startups get funded, many more creative endeavors will get going. Most won't be black swans but that doesn't mean they won't be side effects of great good.<p>If I'm wrong about that, then maybe there is an analogy with subprime, where lenders' (investors') zeal caused them to lend to (fund) ever-crappier borrowers (founders). On the other hand, if I'm right, then this is more about correcting an inefficient allocation of talent in our economy.",1347398608

Little girls love destruction every bit as much as little boys.<p>When they get a little bit older we start seeing different behavior.  Little girls play with dolls because we buy them dolls.  Little girls wear dresses because we buy them dresses.  Little girls start emulating princesses because all the little-girl movies we let them watch have princesses as role models.  Fart jokes will still be hilarious for a while, but eventually that becomes ""gross boy stuff"".  Yes, there is evidence that male and female minds work differently, but we certainly do our best to force them to develop along different paths!<p>Physics and math are tools for understanding and manipulating the universe around us.  If you want to get young students interested in math and physics, don't try to get them to understand a deep proof about why 1+1=2.

The problem is that some of the lessons girls are taught about what it is to be female contradict their human nature.

It simplifies a lot of the complexities of embedded development while still been surprisingly powerful. You'll want to start by learning the basics: How to control the general purpose IO (GPIO) pins, basic serial communication, analog to digital converters (ADC), digital to analog converters (DAC), etc.<p>The Arduino is a nice platform for beginners because it provides a nice set of libraries that abstract away a lot of the complexities of developing embedded systems. If you're just interested in building hardware for a hobby the Arduino may satisfy all your needs. But, if you're interested in actually developing products to sell I'd recommend that you quickly move from the Arduino to some more serious hardware. This isn't to say you can't make real products with an Arduino; I know there are projects like the Makerbot that use it to great success. But I think by just using an Arduino you run the risk of learning a framework rather than having a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between the software and hardware.<p>After Arduino I'd recommend getting a development board such as: <a href=""http://www.actel.com/products/hardware/devkits_boards/smartfusion_eval.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.actel.com/products/hardware/devkits_boards/smartf...</a>. One of the classes I took in college used these boards and they're pretty awesome. They have an ARM microcontroller and FPGA on a single chip. If you're not familiar with FPGAs check out the wikipedia article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array</a>. Basically they enable you to implement digital logic through software using a Hardware Descriptor Language (HDL). Usually the manufacturer will also provide you with premade IP cores you can drop in. These are things like ADC converters, controllers for SPI or I2C, etc. You can also get crazy though and design custom chips even a complete general purpose processor and test it out on the FPGA.<p>Hopefully this helps.

(I'm currently reading a 'use CBT to cure social anxiety' book which has been rather eye-opening.)<p>Regardless, I like the site, though it sometimes gets a bit choppy on my old macbook pro.  I think 50 might be a bit steep as an up-front cost - it almost put me off.<p>Also, have you considered doing an iphone app for the diary?  I use some supposedly motion sensing app to wake me up with music.  It doesn't work very well, but for your purposes I could easily see just thumping the phone when I notice I'm awake instead of having to look at a clock and remember a time.",1347397485

It often should be ""How do I get ___ to be interested in reporting on me?"" rather than ""How do I get on?""<p>Think of it as a value equation: you want the reporters to help you get press and make people think you have something cool on hand; they want something cool to share with their readers.<p>So, one way to do it is - as most of the comments have suggested - use guerrilla tactics to get to the journalists/writers/topics that are often covered.<p>But, what if you created or generated something that is really unique and content-worthy? We did this recently with my product, and ended up with an unsolicited TC piece.<p>How'd it work? We showed-off the types of awesome things our product could do, and it caught the writer's interest.<p>So, I'd say find a way to show-off why what you're doing deserves coverage, and then take some steps to help get that in front of people (that's where Twitter, HN, etc. comes into play).<p>Also, quick note, but the traffic you probably expect from TC coverage may not be accurate.",1347397392

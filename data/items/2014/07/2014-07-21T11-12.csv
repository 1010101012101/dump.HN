8063313,comment,8063035,8063035,16,0,sentientmachine,,,"Also watch out for a bait and switch on Airbnb.  I&#x27;m actually sitting in a nice apt now from airbnb.  So I am happy with it.  But there is another host who is trying to get me for an $1800 cleaning fee.  What happens is you book a room in advance for a month.  Then the host waits until 12 hours before the point of no cancelation to say &quot;its not available but there is another one for a lot less cost that is a lot worse.&quot;. You say no before the cutoff window but then he lowers the cost to bargain basement levels.  You accept.  And he accepts by booking a different apartment under the haggling text message agreement.  Naturally you move to requisition the disagreement as he said he would.  But he stalls until the last minute and unsweetens the deal until you cancel.  Boom.  He has your money and can point to the fine print and his strict cancellation policy that the trouble he went through to clean the room and get it &quot; fixed up&quot; justifies the $1800 charge for a room I didn&#x27;t set foot in.<p>Moral if the story.  If you don&#x27;t get prompt reply and if any changes occur after booking.  Stay away from that host.  They are fishing for free money playing the rules of Airbnb.<p>Airbnb is supposedly going to get back to me about this disagreement, and there is a ticket to deal with it.  But its been 5 days after the event and I pinged them twice with email.  My other option may be to contest the charge on my credit card.  Scammers are everywhere that rules and large sums of money can be found.  And many of those scammers will be right there along side you jockeying for victimhood status.",1405943974

8063307,comment,8058480,8058480,1,0,todd8,,,"Haskell&#x27;s flexibility in naming operators is unusual. Haskell allows programmers to make up their own operators.  Want a spaceship operator? You can define it to be represented as <=>.  Want division defined over quaternions?  You can make up an operator for that too, maybe /: would be good.  Working with algebraic rings?  >< can be defined as the multiplicative operator over the elements of the ring.<p>The syntax rules for Haskell allow sequences like +++ or +.+ or <..> or <---> to all be interpreted as operators.  This led to the problem for the author who may have missed the fact that Haskell was behaving in a completely consistent manner when it objected to the symbol ..- in her program. She really intended two different symbols, the .. followed by the -, but she ran them together. The error wasn&#x27;t the fact that the range&#x27;s end point was negative.  From my perspective, the author&#x27;s statement &quot;In conclusion, I’m going to stick to Node and Rust until Haskell is further developed and at least out of beta.&quot; is over the top. I&#x27;m not claiming that I too haven&#x27;t been frustrated with various programming languages and compilers and been ready (many times) to throw in the towel, who hasn&#x27;t. However, I don&#x27;t want readers to get the wrong idea about Haskell because of this single, and perhaps surprising, syntax error. Haskell is not in beta and is a <i>very</i> consistent language. I hope that the author gives Haskell another chance.<p>Every successful programming language has it&#x27;s own characteristics and peculiarities, even at the syntactic level. PL/1 doesn&#x27;t have reserved words so IF and THEN could be variables.  APL has left to right operator precedence so (5 + 5 * 2) was 20 not 15.  Algol-68 allows operator precedence for built in operators to be changed by the programmer! Lua arrays are indexed from 1 while C arrays are indexed from 0.  Python uses whitespace to indicate code blocks.  Lisp relies on parentheses. COBOL spelled out arithmetic in english words. In Forth one computes 5+(5 * 2) by writing 5 5 2 * +. So it is not at all unusual for Haskell to have it&#x27;s own distinct syntax.<p>One of my professors told a story that I&#x27;ve always remembered: His very young son was walking next to him and suddenly stopped in front of a house and exclaimed &quot;This house is broken!&quot; His father asked &quot;Why do you say that about this nice looking house?&quot; His son then replied &quot;Look at the sidewalk; there is a little crack here.&quot;",1405943836

8063304,comment,8062676,8063125,2,0,epsylon,,,"> Motive: The motive &quot;mistake&quot; is a motive that works for both sides.<p>Yes but as I said, if this was a mistake from the Ukrainian part, the rebels would have everything to gain to prove it. But all they seem to be doing right now is strongly interfere with the investigation.<p>> Identity: The membership in the groups &quot;Russian&quot; and &quot;former FSB&quot; is at most an indication. &quot;All former FSB members that are Russian shoot down passenger air planes&quot; holds as much as &quot;All Germans kill jews&quot; and &quot;All jews kill Palestinians&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not the point that I made there. The most likely explanation is that it&#x27;s a mistake. Russia gave the &quot;separatists&quot; (which are truly agents of the government) a sophisticated anti-air weapon. Someone used it against a plane, only they messed up and ended up shooting down a civilian airplane. I am pretty sure that the Kremlin is super pissed off that this happened. This doesn&#x27;t change the fact that: the &quot;separatists&quot; are Russian agents (who are maybe a bit too much on the loose?) and that Russia gave them the weapon that lead to this mistake. I&#x27;m certainly not saying that Russia wanted this plane to be shot down (and that seems very unlikely, considering how much backlash they are facing now).<p>>  The thing is, I assume Western media is as biased as Russian media. The very fact they rarely even consider Ukrainian govt participation (as they should also with the Maidan sniper shootings) makes me wonder what side I should trust less.<p>I would disagree. Of course, Western media are biased, but the bias they have is mostly done through capital (big media groups with ties to politicians). Russian media is a propaganda machine. Despite all the flaws of our Western countries, they are still less corrupted and less susceptible to propaganda than Russia.<p>> The very fact they rarely even consider Ukrainian govt participation (as they should also with the Maidan sniper shootings) makes me wonder what side I should trust less.<p>It&#x27;s a sad thing but that&#x27;s something to be expected of &quot;general consumption&quot; media. Of course they will paint Ukraine as the good guys and Russia as the bad guys because it serves their story. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that Russia isn&#x27;t the bad guy here, and most of the evidence points that way.<p>In particular in this plane crisis, it has to be said that neither the USA nor the EU want to be involved in Ukraine. A war over there would be yet another mess (like Yugoslavia was). So far the position of the EU and the USA has been fairly tame, but the fact that Russia was caught red-handed delivering weapons to wage their proxy war (and annex some new territory to &quot;the Greater Russia&quot;, which is Putinism&#x27;s ultimate goal), changes things, and the USA and the EU may have to get reluctantly involved if Russia doesn&#x27;t back off. Considering that the USA and the EU don&#x27;t have much to gain or to lose in Ukraine (because let&#x27;s face it, Western people don&#x27;t give a shit about the fate of the Ukrainians for the most part, as has been demonstrated by the previous very weak involvement during the riots; and due to the fact that Ukraine has very little to offer since they don&#x27;t have any significant natural resources), I&#x27;d say that Western media (and in particular more specialized media you can find on the web written by analysts and not general purpose journalists) are much more likely to be trustworthy on this.<p>> This view is partially based on the WMD allegations in Iraq and the use of chemical weapons by Assad, both of which can be considered &quot;false flags&quot;.<p>The WMD allegations were largely countered by many of the Western media (in particular in Europe). France refused to participate in that war.<p>PS: An interesting read: the AmA of a Ukrainian man who lives in a rebel controlled zone on Reddit yesterday: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b72ir/iama_ukrainian_who_currently_lives_on_the/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2b72ir/iama_ukrainian_...</a>",1405943820

Planks, plastic, bits of container, every type of plastic ever made.

Otherwise, many open source projects that I use with some combination of very cranky, irritable, rude, egotistical, and/or arrogant people involved would be ruled out as well...<p>Closed source that costs $$$ is definitely an issue - for a while after school it was hard to continue using Mathematica until my employer acquired a site license and I got a home license.  In the meantime I tried all of the usual suspects - from open source things (Maxima, Sage, Octave, Julia, and so on...) to other commercial products (e.g., Maple and Matlab).  I ended up returning to Mathematica for two reasons: 1) it has a massive standard library, and once you learn the idioms of the library and the language, I found it pretty usable; 2) it has beautiful graphics capabilities.<p>The open source tools are hit-or-miss on the standard library front - some of the libraries are great, some are missing major features, or their implementations are poor.  (Yes, it&#x27;s OSS and one can either contribute code or feedback, but often I have a problem to solve NOW - I don&#x27;t have time to wait for the OSS to catch up.)<p>As for the graphics, I&#x27;m not sure what it is about Mathematica visualizations that I like so much, but they look GOOD relative to the others I&#x27;ve tried.<p>At the end of the day though, Mathematica is just one of the useful tools in my toolchain - the others have their plusses and minuses as well.  But one thing I&#x27;ve adapted to over the years is that A) sometimes good software costs money, and B) sometimes jerks are involved in creating good software.  Neither case is one that I feel is a valid justification for rejecting a software package outright.<p>Edit: It&#x27;s worth noting the time period over which I&#x27;ve been mucking around with Mathematica and the other alternatives I mentioned above.  I started seriously using numerical and scientific computing software (including Mathematica) in 1994, so that&#x27;s a 21 year period of wandering around the space trying out things here and there.",1443228227

10281543,comment,10280324,10281455,0,0,malgorithms,,,"The simple idea is that it&#x27;s a directory mapping public keys to social accounts. If I know you as a Twitter user, I might want to send you an encrypted message. Or if I get a message from you that&#x27;s signed, I might want to know that you&#x27;re a certain Hacker News user.  If I download some source code, I&#x27;d like to know it was signed by someone who has Github account X, and write access on example.com.  And so on.<p>Historically, a few people using PGP would do this identity mapping, at least in one direction, by posting a PGP fingerprint (of their public key) on their, say, Twitter profile . Of course, this only went in one direction. To achieve a bidirectional proof, they would also have to post a signed statement going in the other direction, too, stating they were in fact that twitter user. (Otherwise you couldn&#x27;t start with a message and conclude which Twitter user sent it - multiple people could claim this.)<p>Keybase started as a hobby project to make these posts structured and formal for PGP users. We just wanted to make this kind of thing easier, so we made a directory to hold the signatures going in the other direction, and a reference client that would look up these announcements and verify them.<p>The other specific advancement is that these signatures have been put into a data structure designed to prevent the server from lying by omission or forking - a big problem that exists with historic key servers. If you remove a key, what&#x27;s preventing the server from not admitting that? Or what&#x27;s preventing the server from giving Alice and Bob a difference experience from Charlie and Diane?<p>Anyway, that was the first idea behind Keybase. To make a better directory and walk people through these proofs.<p>What we realized - and what has gotten us both (a) extremely smart developers to join us, and (b) funding - is that there are deeper problems beyond the identity establishment....problems that can be solved in 2015.<p>Those two problems are (1) pretty sucky clients for public key crypto (at least from the perspective of non-programmers), and (2) key management issues. The first is something we have experience with, as our team has worked on a lot of successful projects. And let&#x27;s be clear, lots of teams could solve this, if given the resources. The second is something we feel can finally be solved thanks to mobile phones.  Phones and watches and other small devices allow you to provision new keys easily, because 2 devices can be brought together. That wasn&#x27;t easy in the past.  All this is now possible without understanding what a key is. Or worrying about how to store and move one around safely. That&#x27;s the new goal: actual crypto clients. For signing, verifying, encrypting, decrypting, and sharing.<p>You can read the front page of keybase.io for some more info, but it&#x27;s somewhat out of date and talks mostly about PGP. This will change when our clients are further along and we&#x27;re seeking more beta testers.",1443227203

Even if there are some bad spies/cops/soldiers out there, a lot of people who get into that line of work do do it for the right reasons and because they genuinely want to make the world a safer place. If very bad things start happening, none of these organisations is going to universally side with a government that is doing those things.<p>For another thing, any organisation that requires funding is subject to influence by whoever funds it. As long as someone has to pay PC Smith&#x27;s salary and there is enough civilisation left for essentials to require money to buy them, PC Smith is going to be accountable on some level because he or she literally can&#x27;t afford not to be.<p>For a third thing, any organisation that enjoys special privileges that most people do not have, for example greater resources provided by the state or powers to do certain things legally when they would otherwise be illegal, is always under threat of having their special status revoked. The natural order is that everyone has the same rights and powers and resources, and the only ways that change are either through democratic acceptability as with policing by consent or through an actual dictatorship/police state scenario. And for reasons 1 and 2 above, it is highly unlikely we would ever actually reach the latter, which means the only way the police and security services get to keep doing what they&#x27;re doing (and the only way the politicians get to keep their jobs) is by maintaining sufficient public support and trust. As we&#x27;ve seen in recent elections, there isn&#x27;t a lot of that going around lately, so it seems unlikely that anyone wants to rock the boat unnecessarily.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth remembering that we&#x27;re talking about Britain here, which means the police very much isn&#x27;t a paramilitary force in the way that many other countries have. Neither our citizens nor our police routinely carry firearms, for example, and while there are certainly specialist units in the police that do have that kind of equipment, they don&#x27;t have anything like the numbers or equipment to put down a serious popular revolt. At the end of the day, there are still only 150,000 or so people working for the police, out of a population of well over 60,000,000.<p>This is why I think we&#x27;re still a very, very long way from the kind of brutal dictatorships and police states that some people in the world still tragically live under today, and why I think despite the flaws of our various government organisations and the need to be mindful of their power and restrict it appropriately we are still a long way from any point of no return in terms of the balance of power between the state and its citizens. We&#x27;ve just let paranoia after a few high profile but actually relatively minor incidents tip the balance too far towards authoritarian tendencies in recent years -- which is, after all, why it&#x27;s called &quot;terrorism&quot;. At some point, we as a society are going to realise that this just plays into the bad guys&#x27; hands and stop putting up with it, and the balance will tip back again.",1443226312

He describes research supporting the recent Nature publication you link to on social and cultural progress, which concludes that our connectivity - free and fast flow of data on networks, people on roads, goods and services across nations, etc. - is our greatest economic and social virtue.  His statistical modeling results really strongly show - &quot;like a law&quot; - that the more connected we are, the wealthier we are as a society.<p>It&#x27;s really interesting to consider how we could concentrate on using all of the data and models to make deep positive impacts on our society, while respecting our human dignity.  To quote Pope Francis&#x27;s address to the U.N. today: &quot;Integral human development and the full exercise of human dignity cannot be imposed. They must be built up and allowed to unfold for each individual, for every family, in communion with others, and in a right relationship with all those areas in which human social life develops – friends, communities, towns and cities, schools, businesses and unions, provinces, nations, etc.&quot;",1443226281

I like this service because people outside of this community will get involved after they work out the kinks. People getting invites are developers and tech-centric people who likely have other keys anyway and are testdriving the software.<p>The biggest way forward for keybase would be Facebook or Twitter allowing you to integrate your key into the service.<p>> it seems like I&#x27;ve been trying to get an account for years, now ;(<p>The keybase github account was created 2 years ago on sept 6 ;). Someone below will likely help you out if you email them.<p>Thanks aianus. Appreciate the invite.",1443225694

I&#x27;ve gotten comments from people that that makes them feel easier about vendor lock in, but honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen many people try and stand up their own service. Would you say that matches your own expectations?",1443225609

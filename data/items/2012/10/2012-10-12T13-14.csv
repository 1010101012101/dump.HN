Let's talk about side-by-side articles, bundling commentary essays with the main feature, boxed info and the whole shebang of stuff that just doesn't seem to work on the internet (and I sorta doubt it will work on tablets, but I'll give it a try). It's stuff that's basically possible thanks to two things: the magazine and broadsheet formats, and extensive editing.<p>Just because Internet is modern doesn't mean it doesn't come with restrictions of it's own. Even automated syndication things like Flipboard managed to emulate the look of a magazine, but not the feature that is editing and selection of content by someone competent, but who you only sort-of agree with.",1350050378

It's possible to know stuff that can't be tested that way, so blind insistence on EBM is likely to throw out some babies along with all that bathwater.<p>Seth Roberts often makes similar points in his blog - people running experiments on themselves of size N=1 can often discover stuff that is useful, even vital, but can't be discovered or demonstrated in a big double-blind study.<p>Imagine that we had no scruples and were willing to throw people out of aircrafts with dummy or with real parachutes. The ones who had parachutes would still <i>notice</i> when the parachute opened and slowed their fall. So we can't rule out the placebo effect! :-)",1350050368

Some worthwhile pieces to read and contrast --<p>Loss leaders (common to almost all retailers):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_leader</a><p>The razor-and-blades business model, made famous by Gillette:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebie_marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebie_marketing</a><p>Compare that to predatory pricing --<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing</a><p>Predatory pricing is most possible when a large profit systems-based company can run a loss in one area to destroy competitors to the system. For instance, British Airway cutting rates on a New York <-> London flight to very cheap if a new carrier emerges to challenge them, even losing money on the route while having the rest of the airline subsidize them.<p>It'd be possible in air travel, because the gains are potentially huge. Airline seats are incredibly perishable, so the additional revenue from flying with a more full plane is <i>very</i> worth running short-term losses to get, and by keeping the general route fares high it could help them a lot. Also, because there's limited airline landing slots, they won't necessarily face constant competition -- if the competitor goes bust and someone like BA can buy their airport slots, they've further entrenched their position against future challengers in multiple ways -- they've got the landing slots, and financiers saw the previous company go bust, making it more difficult to get capital.<p>How does that differ from razors-and-blades or loss leading? I think it comes down to intent. Discounting, taking no gain, or even a small loss to win a consumer's attention and business seems worthy, especially when developing new markets. Discounting strictly to destroy competition, with the intent of raising prices very quickly after the competition goes bust -- that's more out of line. A quick acid test might be, ""Would this be a viably pursued strategy if there was no competition?""<p>And with legitimate loss-leading, you could say <i>yes</i>. Someone will go to a liquor store more off if there's a cheap decent beer or wine on sale, regardless of competition in the area. People would potentially buy more disposable razors if the initial package of working razor comes in at a cheap price point, so it's easy for new people to try it out. Likewise, the Kindle.<p>All of these strategies establish market positions and gain market share, which is obviously somewhat to the potential detriment of would-be competitors (...well, unless it grows the market more than grabs market share...) -- but loss leading or razors-and-blades seems to focus more on attracting the consumer than bankrupting the competition.",1350050311

Based on my experience this can have a really big impact, but I don't see it discussed very often.<p>Being able to have easy, casual friendships and one-on-one conversations with your coworkers can be extremely important to knowing what is going on and what you should be doing to succeed. Like you said, there are opportunities that come up in these meetings that you just don't get otherwise.<p>I don't think this is even a conscious decision to avoid seeming flirty a lot of the time, wanting to do things outside of work with same-gender colleagues might just feel more natural.

Much fewer trans men (and non trans women) in tech, it seems.<p>Also, the number of women historically majoring in CS dropped off significantly in the 1980s, when 1. Video gaming culture started to take off and 2. Hardware (something seen as more masculine) started to be emphasized more often.

But that's a design decision, not a technical one.<p>A diff/merge program that operates at a word level of granularity should be just as capable of handling two words edited on the same line as a line-oriented diff program is of handling two lines edited in the same function.<p>> The post proposes a single line-break after each clause or sentence, and then a double line-break after each paragraph.<p>It's a lot easier to rewrite the typographical conventions a piece of software conforms to than it is to rewrite the typographical conventions that millions of humans grew up using.  Teaching the diff/merge program to recognize that CRLF isn't the only text boundary out there would achieve the same effect* at much lower cost.<p>*I realize that abbreviations complicate it somewhat. I'd submit, though, that if a basic diff/merge program is being relied on too closely in a scenario where that actually causes any consequential problems then the real error might be between Mr. Diff User's keyboard and chair.  For normal diff usage 'failed' symbol boundary determinations like that are fine, the same as how a traditional line-oriented diff program doesn't critically suffer from the way it would interpret me inserting a carriage return into a line of code.",1350049823

Rape can be a sexist act of violence, that's an extreme.

There are plenty of bad things. And sexism is bad for your business.  Because discrimination doesn't just mean that some people are privileged over others.  It means viewpoints, ideas, projects etc. from people who are women are not given the attention they deserve not because they are lacking, but because their source lacks testes.  Discrimination doesn't just hurt women, it hurts everybody.<p>You advance a guy over a more deserving woman... you are hurting your business.  sexism is suboptimal.

How did the upper 10% (mostly the upper 0.1%), manage to capture over 90% of the income gains in the past few decades in America?<p>Consider that in a typical residential single family home in one of the hot real estate markets like SV, most of the valuation is embedded in the land and not the improvements. You can confirm this by checking the values SFH's are insured for; the insurance companies aren't stupid. If homes really appreciate in value, then their intrinsic utility modulo their location is expected to rise, and their insurance valuations to correspond. They don't.<p>In other words, most people aren't improving their houses to the extent justifiable by the inflation of the valuation placed upon them over time. The inflation goes into the dirt. There are two entities that mostly benefit from this: the local property tax assessment jurisdiction, and the bank. The upside for them in this arrangement is much more immediate than for the typical home debtor. A junior beneficiary is the real estate agency. Under very specific circumstances, a new home developer also stands in line to financially benefit before the home debtor does.<p>A home debtor's financial upside is mostly realized at the tail end of the life cycle of the transaction, when they sell (there is a significant sidebar here on whether or not selling is desirable). Most US federal tax filers take the standard deduction and even the MID doesn't benefit them.<p>If some outlier upgraded a house to boast its own energy production (like with solar and biogas), sewage treatment (like with constructed wetland), highly-automated integrated cycle aquaponics/vermicomposting/agriculture setup, and so on, and was able to sell a surplus production/handling capacity to their neighbors, I will grant that such a house has intrinsic wealth and its improvements justify an increasing valuation. But absent that kind of actual productive capability, most houses only sell based upon prevailing wages.<p>This is a very bad arrangement for the middle class because it strands a lot of capital into dirt for financialization purposes, instead of actually improving the house itself. If that stranded capital was put to use in upgrades that make a house easier to maintain, longer-lasting, more sustainable, more economical to operate, just about anything other than inflating a principal number so the returns from a percentage on that principal increase, then the middle class would actually immediately benefit from their houses.<p>The middle class in aggregate is not organized enough to generate on demand such an aggregate comparative advantage that they temporarily possessed about 5-6 decades ago anytime soon again, and waiting for history to hand it another such comparative advantage would be folly. My guess at a solution is for individuals within the middle class to find their own localized and organized comparative advantages.<p>This is kind of going far astray of HN's charter, so to pull us back towards a more HN-friendly territory, I will leave this response at the following. For the majority of actors in most real estate transactions for residential real estate for occupancy by owner, very few benefit from an increasing price that is misaligned with thirty-year sustainable prevailing income trends. In the specific HN-oriented context of technology business owners and employees, each dollar spent on residential housing not spent on improving the future valuation of employees and owners can be considered a flat, deadweight loss to the venture. I would personally much rather have my capital (of all sorts) working for me in my venture or directly improving my valuation where I have far more relative control over the outcome, than stranded in dirt and subject to the capriciousness of prevailing wages where I have far less relative control.",1350049578

4644981,comment,4643892,4643892,1,0,acdha,,,"For me, it came down to taking the rest of the system as seriously as the kernel. I first installed Linux back in the 0.9 days and it was interesting but no more so than 386BSD or TSX-32: boot the kernel and spend time trying to get applications to compile. Forward ahead a year or two to Slackware where packages installed in a few seconds rather than significant fractions of an hour (yay, 20MHz 386!) because they had binary packaging and updates were relatively simple, freeing time to write code in this hot new Perl language rather than trying to compile it.<p>I tried FreeBSD & OpenBSD repeatedly over the years, even running a key company server on OpenBSD for awhile in the late 90s / early 2000s - security was compelling - but I noticed two things:<p>1. BSD users treated updates like going to the dentist and put them off until forced - not without cause, as ports frequently either broke things or simply spent hours rebuilding the world - whereas Linux users generally spent time working on their actual job rather than impromptu sysadmin. ""apt-get update && apt-get upgrade"" had by then an established track record of Just Working and fresh install time for a complex system was measured in minutes for Debian (iops-limited) and, even as late as 2004 or so when we ditched the platform, days for FreeBSD even when performed by our resident FreeBSD advocate. I'm sure there are ways to automate it but while routine in the Linux world, I've never met a BSD user in person who actually did this.<p>2. The <i>BSD systems were simply less stable, often dramatically so, because the parts were never tested together: you had the kernel which is stable and deserves significant respect but everything else was a random hodgepodge of whatever versions happened to be installed the last time someone ran ports. Unlike, say, Debian or Red Hat there was no culture of testing complete systems so a few months after a new release you'd often encounter the kind of ""foo needs libbar 1.2.3 but baaz needs 1.1.9"" dependency mess which required you to spend time troubleshooting and tinkering  a class of problem which simply did not exist at the system level for most of the Linux world. It wasn't as bad as Solaris but the overall impression was more similar than I'd like.<p>One other observation: during years of using Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris / Nexenta / etc. on a number of systems (the most I've managed personally at any point in time was around ~100) there were almost no times where the actual kernel mattered significantly in a positive direction. Performing benchmarks on our servers or cluster compute nodes showed no significant difference, so we went with easier management. On the desktop, again no significant performance difference so we went with easier management and better video driver support (eventually why many desktop users moved to OS X - no more GL wars). There was a period where more stable NFS might have been compelling but the </i>BSD and Linux NFS clients both sucked in similar ways (deadlocking most times a packet dropped) and the Linux client got better faster and we ended up automating dead mount detection with lazy-unmounts to reduce the user-visible damage.",1350049575

2) She works in UX, which is actually pretty well represented by women.<p>My two cents from a woman who actually works in a technical position (I'm a developer) for > 10 years now.  Also working in infosec, which is one of the least represented when it comes to gender balance.  Note: this is all totally anecdotal.<p>IMHO, ""Imposter Syndrome"" is one of the primary reasons we don't have more women in the industry, and it's reinforced heavily because of the culture of most workplaces.   Why?  When you emphasize a ""brogrammer"" and ""rockstar"" culture it's hard to believe that you can step in there and be just as ""good as the guys.""<p>When I'm talking about brogramming culture, I am not talking about silly shit like they turned the woman's bathroom to a man's one (lol, they did this at one company I worked at) or that you need to stop making fart jokes etc.  I mean the idea we are all super awesome rockstars that sling amazing code and everyone else around you is shit and an idiot for not knowing something that you (and the other guys) know.  When you're already feeling kind of alienated for being different, this can be really intimidating (and it's worse when people point it out -- I was asked an interview for a programming teaching position at a university BY A PROFESSOR ""how will you handle it if people don't take you seriously as a female?"")<p>I struggled with this for many years.  I always assumed everyone around me knew more about computers (they didn't) and their code was 100% perfect (lol, it wasn't).<p>The effect for me was I was afraid to ask questions and when I wanted to figure out something, I did the research/reading on my own because I felt I had to prove that I was 110% competent - imagine how much time I could have saved and how much faster I would have progressed if in those early days I had just felt more comfortable asking people for help.<p>Because of this, I think corporate environments are an easier more comfortable place for a woman to work in a programming job than startups and small companies (again, this isn't universal).  Which is sad, because I love working at a small company.  And the startup space could benefit from women (since there are so few people usually in a startup, esp if you're building a product that will be widely used by women, it is invaluable to have that perspective).<p>2) What can you do about it?  Well, if you're a woman, and you want to be in the tech field because you love working with computers, and you continue to pursue it, you're doing something already.  You're an example to every other woman.  I think only in this way, eventually the gender balance will even out.

I've only jumped ship when the opportunity was better for my career.<p>I knew I needed a change when I found myself installing RPMs all day. Not many people are fortunate to be in an environment where they can make recommendation or changes within an organization. When I asked if I could automate some tasks, I was greeted with a roundabout explanation on why we don't automate things. That's when I knew I had to get out. Other sysadmins were ""happy"" with their job. I guess for some folks, a 9-5 job is all they care for.<p>Me? I worry about what will happen years from now. If I'm 50 and need to find a job, can I market myself against someone who is younger? If I don't build my skillset now, I'm at a disadvantage many years from now. So to answer your question, when my job becomes so easy that I don't learn anything new or I'm not afraid of an upcoming task, that's when I know I need to question myself. If I'm not challenged, then what's the point of staying?<p>For some, it's a paycheck and a means to pay bills and raise their family.

Bringing in a book designer would likely make it more like a book, which it would fail at, and a great designer would also try to make it a beautiful book, which it would fail even worse at.<p>Great books design is a factor of not just picking a good font, but the <i>right</i> font.  The right margins and font size, the right paper weight and finish, the right line height, cover, putting blank pages and linebreaks in the right spot even when it's not consistent.  These are the tools of the book designer.<p>But e-books take all of those tools away.  Sure e-books could handle all of that, you could make a reader capable of displaying LaTeX files pixel-perfectly, but it would be a terrible experience.  I bought my mom a kindle because she can make the font size gigantic, it would be unbearable for me to read like that.  I have my kindle set to use a different font, size, line spacing, and margin than my girlfriend, and the fact that we can make it just right for ourselves is one of the reasons I've read exactly 1 hardcopy book out of 50 in the past ~2 years and she's read maybe 2.<p>I'm not saying the kindle can't be improved, but you need someone who wants to make a better kindle, not a more book-like kindle.  In my experience, great leaps in design need to come from a distance.  The best early website/Director designs were not made by the best print designers, or the best programmers.  They were made by people with backgrounds in music and dance and animation, those that grasped the actual beauty of interaction, in that it is dynamic and ephemeral, not ""just so"".  You can't get much more uncompromising than a book designer.

Yes. Written down in an excel sheet.<p>Did I follow the plan?
No. I don't why. Just woke up every morning to find myself staring at the plan, scribbling notes and writing random code snippets.

Build something whose optimal speed is slower, and you can make the whole thing more efficient.<p>Probably the best single-number measure of aerodynamic efficiency is the lift-to-drag ratio. For most airliners, 787 most likely included, this ratio is in the low 20s. The best machines out there are in the 70s.

Is the objection to the inclusion of research? The serious criticism is that she rejects the exclusion of several self-collected data points, even if they have not been compiled by sociologists. But to subvert the point with a general aspersion to research at large ( <i>Some research is great, but a lot of research is totally skewed to prove a point, and its not always easy to tell which is which</i> ) only fuels people who would repurpose that line about the point trying to be made.<p>3. The serious criticism is that he has unsubstantiated assertions ( <i>all women find a male-dominated industry less appealing and all-male groups less welcoming</i> ), but the trivialization that immediately follows ( <i>at the very least you need to preface them with some research has found or many women find that</i> ) fundamentally denies the value that statistics, and empirical measurement, plays in social science.<p>It sounds like there's a kernel of something valuable, but the signal to noise ratio is too low.

4644825,comment,4644475,4644475,28,0,mdkess,,,"Sexism that I've noticed has been very subtle. I work with some very intelligent people, so I can't imagine anyone is overtly sexist (ie. thinking that women can't do this job, would not hire a person simply based on gender etc.), but still, there are problems. It's hard to write about sexism as a guy without feeling like you're coming off as sexist, but hey, I probably am. Also, it's hard to write about things without generalizing, so I don't think that these apply equally to all organizations, or all members of either gender, but as a population (of people and of companies), my thoughts are:<p>For one, I think that recruiting is very masculine. ""Solve impossible problems! Be a rockstar! Join the most hardcore developers in the world!"". It works, but I think that men find a lot more appeal in it than women do. I think that things like mentoring and career growth are also important - not that that detracts from the end result of solving really hard problems, but I think that it presents it to a more growth oriented way. So I think that especially college recruiting should still focus on the fun, hard engineering aspect of the job, it should also focus on the growth side. We'll train you, you'll work with people - we want smart people, we'll make you into an awesome developer.<p>Aggressiveness. If I want a raise, I'll go and ask for a raise. If I want something changed, I'll speak up about it. If I'm not happy with things, I'll quit and find another job. I think that this trait is more common in men, but it has certainly led to my success - pay quickly diverges with this strategy.<p>Then there's the social aspect. Within the office, I think that everyone talks with everyone else on pretty equal footing. That said, while I'd be totally comfortable asking one of my male colleagues if he wanted to grab a beer after work, I'd be at least more hesitant to do so with a female colleague so as not to make them uncomfortable (being married makes this a little bit less awkward for me) and I think that's not unique. People don't want to come off as flirting with a co-worker, or make them uncomfortable, and so they don't go out after work except in a group (and have no other recourse when they are the only female developer in a staff of 50). The people who do go out though end up talking about work, and end up solving problems that they wouldn't have otherwise. They also get more opportunity to move between projects as their friends move around within the company.<p>Then there's the awful problem of low numbers. If you meet a crummy male developer, well, he's a crummy developer. If you meet a bad female developer, she's probably a significant portion of all female developers that you've met - and so at least subconsciously, I think that for many the association becomes that female developers are bad (since hey, 33.3% of all female developers you've worked with aren't that great).<p>Those are the main things I think. I think that all of these can be fixed, but I think that it takes conscious effort on the part of the company and the staff to get around them. I think at the heart of it is a bootstrapping problem - there are too few female developers because there are too few female developers, and as that changes culturally things will get better. We can definitely speed it up though.<p>As an aside, I talked to a professor once about sexism in the computer science faculty, and he said something really interesting: while the top few students in the class are typically men due to the sheer number of people (if 90% of students are men, 10% are women, by pure statistics the top 1% will mostly be men), very rarely are women in the bottom 75% of the class. He attributed this to a lack of ego - there's a real masculine competitiveness to the computer science faculty (the goal to be ""hardcore""), which women were generally excluded from. Without this ego drive, they weren't too proud to learn.",1350047403

It's not terribly common or widespread, but it's there.<p>But the tech industry is also famously self-selective. Many people in the industry self-selected for it when they were pre-teens. Spending hours upon hours programming in BASIC or whatever on their C64s or TRS-80s before they were out of elementary school...before thoughts of sexism enter the consciousness. There is very little preventing young girls from getting involved with tech at a very young age except simple lack of interest.<p>Anecdotally,  I remember growing up and horsing around with many friends on our 8-bit computers before any of us had 2-digit ages. As I grew up the friends and computers changed, but the basic demographic didn't. When my peer group hit puberty we would have killed a member of the peer group to get a girl involved in our group of nerds.<p>Many of my friends had sisters, none of their sisters cared the first thing about what we were doing. A few of their sisters showed some interest at times, but always seemed to have other priorities. This must be a shared experience as the type of group arrangement in the <i>Big Bang Theory</i> resonates with all of the tech industry males I know.<p>It wasn't until half-way through high-school that we finally lured a couple of girls into our group, but we spent most of the time teaching them basic computer skills than nerding out with them. Nevertheless I never heard anybody put the female members of our group down, or act like they weren't capable of eventually doing the high-nerd things that we were doing. To the person, everybody was helpful, and the girls hung around and one even tried her hand at majoring in CS...before changing majors to International Relations.<p>Happily, things have changed for the better. The number of women in tech has dramatically increased since those early days. It's not 50/50 by any stretch of the imagination. But there are actual women in tech these days doing cool things. They've self-selected to enter it and have put in the time to become good at it, and have managed to ignore the real sexism (such as it is) and that's very very cool.<p>It's an additional barrier that many males don't have to deal with, but I think self-selection at an early age is an even larger one.",1350047295

Depending on how old you are (I'm mid 30s now so school in the early 90s) and how behind the times your teachers were, I reckon it was pretty common for people not to understand that there was a career to be had in computers. This could be down to plain ignorance of how important they were going to become. I only realised it was an interest after starting and hating an engineering course in 96, because all school ever told me was 'here is a machine you can use to write documents and make pictures'.<p>Of course if the reason she wasn't told was because of her gender then sure, inherent sexism.",1350047012

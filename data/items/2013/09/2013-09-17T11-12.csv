That said, I think static type analysis done right has it&#x27;s place.<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason why you can&#x27;t integrate static analysis into  dynamic language development process like in CL. SBCL compiler already does huge amount of type analysis in compile time. Instead of type errors, it gives type warnings and hints for the purpose of making faster code.<p>What if you would extend this functionality outside compilation. What if you could declare functions that are entry points to the &quot;program&quot; and you would do block compilation equivalent and give type errors if programmer wants them. This would probably be before commit type thing and part of testing.",1379419124

6398725,comment,6398393,6398393,11,0,Peaker,,,"> It appears that in the presence of mutable state, a lot of the advantages of monads become moot.<p>In the simpler cases where use of monads can be replaced by simple mutable state -- you still lose out on the explicit types of the mutating vs. pure code.<p>For example, STM is possible because mutating effects are typed, and so can be ruled out of STM transactions.<p>And in the more complex monads (e.g: transformer stacks), mutable state is just not good enough. You can compose transformers to build things that mutable state simply cannot express, and you&#x27;d have to CPS transform your code and avoid mutable state to express those things.<p>For example, these two monads:<p><pre><code>  ListT (ParsecT m)
  ParsecT (ListT m)

Honestly it doesn&#x27;t even look that much more typing; and (subjectively!) has a little better semantics, e.g. you can say that bar is a function with the type `Foo -> String`.<p>O.bar foo doesn&#x27;t look that bad, does it? Sure. Except when you have nested data structures. And you very often have nested data structures.

One of the first things I remember from OOP learning is that constructors should be as safe as they can be, which means no allocations, partial or not. Of course it is tempting to misuse the language features out of personal commodity and blame someone else. I think we can agree that a few design changes would solve the ambiguous cases. Also, for the &quot;remembering&quot; problem, we can inherit from a base class having all the needed restrictions in place. The std&#x27;s &quot;<i>something</i>_ptr&quot; gimmicks may sound like a good compromise at first, but just like the garbage collector, these will make you lazy and neglectful over time.

  Please write the git repo address and branch name alone on the same line
  so that I can&#x27;t even by mistake pull from the wrong branch, and so that
  a triple-click just selects the whole thing.

  So the proper format is something along the lines of:

        &quot;Please pull from

                git://jdelvare.pck.nerim.net/jdelvare-2.6 i2c-for-linus

         to get these changes:&quot;

  so that I don&#x27;t have to hunt-and-peck for the address and inevitably
  get it wrong (actually, I&#x27;ve only gotten it wrong a few times, and
  checking against the diffstat tells me when I get it wrong, but I&#x27;m
  just a lot more comfortable when I don&#x27;t have to &quot;look for&quot; the right
  thing to pull, and double-check that I have the right branch-name).

  Please use &quot;git diff -M --stat --summary&quot; to generate the diffstat:
  the -M enables rename detection, and the summary enables a summary of
  new/deleted or renamed files.

  With rename detection, the statistics are rather different because
  git will notice that a fair number of the changes are renames.

Rolling your own framework is a <i>lot</i> of work and you&#x27;re not even guaranteed to wind up with something better than what&#x27;s out there. Some people believe jQuery is bloated and create their own framework with a mix-and-match from microjs.com. Great! But it&#x27;s super painful to work with, because at some point you realize &quot;oh, i need to deep-copy this object&quot; or &quot;this should slide down - oh wait&quot; and suddenly you&#x27;re re-inventing wheels all over the place.

In K, a run length encoder would be something like:<p><pre><code>    {(x@&~m),&#x27;(+/m)@&~m:~&#x27;:x}

Once nations start going down the track of setting up virtual borders (believe this is what this would lead to), all flow of information will be condemned as it is in the real world. A national network would be used in making solid cases for embargos and sanctions against people and their knowledge, which they were at full liberty to share and disclose as they saw fit.

Consider this move as the first brick.<p>Surely internet surveilance exists and anybody who thought it wasn&#x27;t ever since its creation was either stupid or indifferent to the idea. The difference between then and now is that we have proof of this. A nation isolating itself into a pocket of its own internal communication network will not solve this problem. I personally think that it is a step back not a step forward. I believe TOR had the right idea but it is no silver bullet. People of Brazil might think that this is a good thing but rest assured all that would change is they&#x27;d be transitioning from global internet surveillance to local internet surveillance.",1379416430

I doubt any of those SaaS services are hurting as a result of the NSA scandal, and those are some of the ones that were specifically mentioned as rich data sources for the g-men.<p>The stories about the NSA breaking into foreign companies for economics reasons got less traction then the consumer social networks because they were less relevant to most of the public, but they are far more relevant to the people making operational decisions in non-US organisations that compete with US companies. For example, how many big Brazilian companies are going to trust Google Docs now that we know that Brazilian companies were spied on by the NSA to steal corporate secrets to aid American companies interests? For those organisations the risks are not theoretical ones about LOVEINT, personal privacy or a slippery slope into fascism. The risks are real and current and those companies are confirmed targets which the US will use any tactic to undermine. Non-American corporations are the targeted enemies of the NSA, and thus the targeted enemies of Amazon, Google and all the other US SaaS providers. For non-US corporations to use those services would be like Obama hosting his email with the North Korean government.",1379416289

Most of the time the solution was: Antibiotics.
Because I was sick quite often, I can say I grew up on Antibiotics. When we moved to West Europe my mother made the mistake of chosing a doctor from our country (so she could uderstand what she says). 
So I continued to get antibiotics until I got an bronchitis. Two weeks had passed until the doctor decided it was a bronchitis and not &quot;just&quot; one of my usual sick-phases (that she also treated with antibiotics). I spend additional two weeks getting more of the same antibiotic. It got worse.
Finaly she decided that it may be useful to make an radiographic examination. Lucily the doctor there realised that I had pneumonia and changed my medication.<p>I have not been to a doctor for over 20 years since.
I did not take anything besides some aspirine when I hit my head skiing 8 years ago. 
I don&#x27;t know how this is possible after my very hard childhood but I just don&#x27;t get sick anymore.<p>I am very sure that I&#x27;ll not make the same mistake of letting the doctors solve everything with the hammer when my children get sick.",1379415848

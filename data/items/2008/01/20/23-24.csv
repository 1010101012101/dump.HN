Writing an ELIZA clone at that age was a <i>lot</i> of fun - I remember in particular thinking it was hilarious to give my version a very rude personality ;-)",1200872443

They actually raised money so they could buy users (literally, they gave users money if they signed up).<p>""entrepreneurs should concentrate on building their company with their own money FIRST""<p>it's precisely because this isn't an option for young founders out of college that something like YC exists. we have no money of our own in the first place so taking external investment is our only option.",1200872357

Which part of our traditions prevents us from having this law?<p>While I have general answers to that question, I don't have any answers specific to this particular law.<p>Edit: BTW my comment did allude to a serious answer. They have a different meaning of freedom in France, and are somewhat hostile to our meaning of it.",1200872057

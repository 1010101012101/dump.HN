They could be very dangerous because they share our problems (lack of energy, lack of resources, etc.).

3395114,comment,3394789,3394789,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I'm so glad he came forward. Maybe now some of the hyperbole can stop. I've been reading stories of the following 2 types:<p>1. Blogs offering commentary on another story about GoDaddy's role in this and pretty much saying ""GoDaddy wrote the bill and gave themselves a bunch of perks"".<p>2. The actual sources of those original blogs. It's funny how the sources say no such thing and actually corroborate this GoDaddy employee's story.<p>If you just read the original sources you'll see that he's right in saying that GoDaddy didn't write the bill and really did just ask to redefine a few points. It's also totally true that all registrars get the exemption.<p>I've stopped commenting on these stories because the second someone introduces a little rationality into the discussion the downvotes and gang-up start flying. I'm no GoDaddy apologist. I think they're assholes for coming out in support of SOPA like everyone else. But why are we focusing so much on them? These stories aren't true. They simply mention GoDaddy and take on a life of their own. Ever since GoDaddy got brought up we've totally gotten distracted. Badly. I don't know why GoDaddy came out in support of SOPA. I'd guess it was so they could hedge their bets in case it passed. It's still wrong but I'm not about to go all conspiracy-theory and buy into any theory along the lines that imply GoDaddy is some sort of oppressive evil company for some mysterious reason.<p>Come on guys, let's be reasonable here. What the guy says is true. I've been a long time GoDaddy hater but even I can't get on board with a lot of this misinformation floating around. Sorry if it's not the popular opinion but it's the truth.",1324972289

That's pretty incredible for such a young car company.<p>I don't think Elon is just ""making money on what's hot."" Building a car company isn't in fashion, and an energy revolution is a pretty clear vertical right now (see Khosla's invetments). Likewise, building a rocket company isn't very fashionable.

3395109,comment,3392857,3394867,4,0,chimeracoder,,,"This is why the first two federal laws targeted at prohibiting drugs didn't actually do it directly - they did it by way of taxes. The Marihuana Stamp Tax Act (1937) is the most famous, but it was preceded by another act that targeted proper narcotics (morphine, etc.). I believe it was the Harisson act, but I'm not certain.<p>In any case, the 1937 bill created an impossible-to-satisfy tax structure, because they knew that a direct prohibition would have been deemed unconstitutional. Unfortunately, by 1970, everyone had forgotten and the Controlled Substances Act passed easily.",1324971792

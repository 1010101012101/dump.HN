4082117,comment,4080836,4081700,3,0,batiudrami,,,">Gamers have shown that they are willing to pay a whole entire dollar per game for some of the absolute best indie games released in recent years.<p>That assumes that people don't already own some of the games, and that they actually want all eight of the games.  For instance, I already own Braid, Limbo and Psychonauts (and paid $10+ for each of them), so when the bundle came out I paid my $10 for Bastion and Sword and Sorcery (and I was only really interested in Bastion).  Of the additions announced today, I already own Braid and SMB.<p>I think it's a lucrative week for the devs, but I think a bigger issue is that when you offer games so cheaply you significantly reduce your potential purchasing base for the future when you essentially give it away.  That being said, I've seen plenty of stats which show game sales slow to a crawl very quickly unless you push it up with significant sales  - it's not like 'work' software where a big sale can significantly decrease your perceived value (imagine if Adobe sold it's Creative Suite for 75% off once a year - no one would ever purchase at full price again!).  Gamers are an impatient bunch and are prepared to pay full price for something they're really excited for.<p>You have to try and find out whether the increased volume generates more volume than it potentially removes in lost future sales, and I tend to think that it does - especially for games like Bastion which had a huge marketing effort when they were on Xbox Live Arcade which would have given them a lot of full-price exposure.",1339116897

And consequently whoever controls that server?<p>You run your own .arpa zone for 10.  So you control the PTR responses for 10.0.0.1 that are directed to your home DNS server?<p>Isn't it true that anyone can download a copy of .arpa zone for the public address space?  You could load this into your .arpa zone on your home DNS server.  Couldn't you shave off a few queries out to the internet for each PTR lookup that way?<p>Running a home DNS server sounds like a smart idea.  You say ""nothing is to stop..."", and due to the ""rules"" allowing out-of-bailiwick delegations that's true (and also a source of some annoying side effects: cache poisoning, extra queries if glue is ignored, etc.), but what if you designed a DNS server to only query authoritative servers?  Then getting the right response would become just a matter of selecting the proper authoritative server from a list, verifying you are actually connecting to that server and then securing the connection from tampering, right?  DNSSEC wouldn't address those needs, would it?<p>Anyway, running your own DNS server sounds like a smart idea.<p>No spammy web pages like OpenDNS?<p>Do you connect to your home DNS server while you're staying at hotels to avoid paywalls?

We're going to stack another $5 trillion on in the next four years.<p>Since when are facts sensationalist bullshit?<p>From this day four years ago to now, we've added roughly $5.89 trillion to the public debt ($9.869t to $15.765t), and that doesn't count all of our liabilities, that's merely a fraction of it represented by the so called ""public debt.""<p>I'd love to see the math on how you propose we ever pay back the $11 trillion in new public debt added from 2008 to 2016/17. Clinton ran the biggest surplus we've had in a very long time ($236b), and it was fake, because it didn't include the money borrowed from inbound Social Security money for the non-existent trust. If we could magically run that Clinton surplus rate from 2017 to 2102 (about 85 years), we'd finally pay off the $20 trillion in public debt we're going to have four years from now.

Proper rainbow tables would need to both account for the salt and the number of encoding runs your bcrypt function has (which, incidentally, is also a configurable value).<p>Some information on how bcrypt, scrypt and friends apply salting and stretching to resist attacks was in yesterday's post at <a href=""http://throwingfire.com/storing-passwords-securely/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://throwingfire.com/storing-passwords-securely/</a> .

If you put a dollar into T-bills, you drive the interest rate a little lower, which causes, say, 70 cents of other investors' money to leave in disgust.  Where do they go?  To other assets.<p>And it's only 70 cents only because the suppliers of new debt, the US authorities, are sensitive to interest rates too.  Investors can, net, only buy as much debt as the government is issuing, right?  So if the Federal authorities are so worried about a liquidity trap, let them limit their debt issuance!  If they do that, then your dollar put into Treasury securities means a dollar worth of other investors' leaving.  No more liquidity trap.  (At least as far as ""highly-liquid and safe assets"" == US govt debt.  They could find other safe and liquid harbors, perhaps Japanese govt debt.)  But the Feds aren't doing that, thus, I think that ""having the government borrow at essentially zero cost and invest that money in public infrastructure projects"" would in fact be bad for real wealth and prosperity because that borrowing brings some more money to T-bills and away from other investments, some of which would be private investments, for example.  Of course if those projects are needed on their merits, not as make-work, then great, do them.<p>The same is true of your example of ""parking cash in the bank"".  Parking cash in the bank means making investments.  Where does the bank put it?  They invest it.  A bank is not a destination for money, it's a conduit.",1339115340

It shows you the commit details and diffs of the latest commit. That makes you feel like something is wrong or pending so you need to respond to it. The latest commit and its diffs are really not the main point of interest in that situation.<p>I would much prefer to see a tree view of the current files in the repo (and maybe the README), just like on GitHub. That would be the most natural way of browsing the files, opening them by clicking, and seeing what has been modified.<p>That would make you feel that you are in control and understand what's going on right from the beginning. Even if you're a newbie or non-tech guy.",1339114478

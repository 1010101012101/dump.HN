3875888,comment,3875640,3875848,0,0,blhack,,,"Because we're the only ones with language.  Language gave us a <i>huge</i> technical advantage over all of the other animals.<p>Typically, in species without language, it takes many generations for a ""mutation""[1] to propagate across the species.<p>If I instinctually figure out a better way of hunting deer, which gives me an advantage over my competitors for mates, and I pass it on to my children, who pass it on to theirs, etc. eventually the new instinct will be present in most of the species.<p>(This is basic basic natural selection).<p>Language changed all of that.  Now instead of waiting for offspring to carry a mutation, I can just <i>tell people</i> about the better way of hunting deer, they can do it, and they can tell people too.<p>Stuff spreads quickly.  It makes humans able to evolve at a much, much, much faster rate than any other animal on the planet.<p>(And yes, really, humans are the only animals on the planet with language.  Bird song, whale song, and tree-pheromones don't count.)<p>[1] In quotes because consciously iterating over a problem (like hunting deer) isn't a ""mutation"" in the classic sense.",1335124761
3875887,comment,3859053,3859053,1,0,vbock,,,"I just think it's a bit bizarre to use sales of dedicated reading technology as a proxy for books read. As has been pointed out here, there's a lot of not-so-dedicated tech that can read e-books. Plus, you know, there are books. Major metro areas still support great independent book stores.  Places out in the hinterlands don't, which means that downloadability is a bigger factor.<p>Anyway, seems to me that if we really cared about literacy, we'd want a random sample of peeps asked how many books they read last month, not what hardware/software they have on which books might potentially be read!",1335124752

I've heard proponents boast that there's enough of the stuff to last us a hundred years at our current consumption  but isn't the whole idea to radically increase our consumption? We easily have room to double or triple it. If this catches on, it seems likely I will have been alive to see both the beginning and the end of natural gas.",1335124735
3875885,comment,3874324,3874672,2,0,andos,,,"I would translate it exactly like that, though it's actually not <i>ad hominem</i> but <i>ad humanitatem</i>, really. We are all biased creatures, as others have pointed out. I think the critique is biased, I think it is biased because the author put a lot of effort in his (otherwise awesome) Java product, and therefore I quoted Upton Sinclair.<p>For instance, he argues that it would take a lot of working around to provide instant feedback for code with side-effects, but isn't that obvious? The LightTable video doesn't claim it magically mocks every external component or does some other fancy stuff. That doesn't make the feature less useful, especially in a language like Clojure, which was used for the demo. For me, that part reads much like ""since it ws so hard to create Chronon, one cannot pretend the LightTable features are so easy to implement. Let me prove that by putting LightTable in the context of my product.""<p>There was  deliberately, yes  a bit of snide and a lot of cynicism in my post, but I hope to have made it clear that it was not without a reason (for the cynicism, at least).",1335124719

3875883,comment,3875508,3875508,3,0,primigenus,,,"""the only reason Google started with such a simple design is because they didnt have a webmaster or anyone that knew HTML.""<p>Can anyone verify this? Sounds a bit far-fetched, to be honest - a company of engineers couldn't figure out HTML enough to put together a decent website? Isn't it more likely that they just put a MVP up and then iterated from there, and since Google was a highly functional search engine, they never felt the need to expand the homepage to include superfluous items?",1335124713
3875882,comment,3875640,3875848,5,0,gwern,,,"Intelligence is expensive[1], and there may be some sort of threshold effect. Let's ignore the last few centuries of Revolutions, and look at the longer scale. Humanity is recognizable back to 200k years or so; civilization in any sense goes back maybe 5k years. How successful was humanity's intelligence during those 195k years? Not very: humanity spread slowly, did not represent a huge population, and suffered many reverses. And that's not even getting into arguments about what the (extinct) Neanderthals mean with their larger brains.<p>[1] Metabolically and in other respects; if you doubt this, I've listed what I know about this in <a href=""http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics</a> and especially the footnotes & hyperlinks.",1335124649

She has been posting all over the Internet for quite some time with lies and extremely slanderous and false accusations claiming that Terrorfakt is a nazi/white power band and that Ben is a Neo-Nazi. There are a few folks out there that have taken her insane and ridiculous lies hook, line and sinker, without actually knowing or learning anything about Ben or Terrorfakt.<p>As a Hispanic and someone that has worked with Ben both in the studio and on the field for some 6 years now, you should ALL KNOW that nothing could be further from the truth. Im making a public statement on this to educate any and all listeners and followers of my own music that might actually believe what that disturbed individual is saying. What most folks dont know or realize, not that it really made any importance back then but clearly does now, is that during the US Manufactura / Terrorfakt tour in 2004 not only were there various members of our bands from various nationalities and races but various religious backgrounds as well. Our own road crew, security and merch personnel included Jewish members.

If you don't do that you\nprobably won't find this very interesting. Sorry! Maybe you could read Text\nfrom Dog if you haven't seen it already? Either way, have a nice\nmorning/afternoon/evening!<p>The Situation\n-------------<p>Every time I get a new computer, I go through the same song and dance:<p>1. Look at what programs and packages I have installed on the old computer.\n2. Install these programs on the new computer.\n3. Copy over my configuration files from the old computer to the new one.\n4. Spend the rest of my day fixing all the things that broke because I'm using\n a newer version of program X.<p>Step 4 is always the most painful part of getting a new machine. Always.<p>Without fail I spend several hours tweaking configuration files, adjusting my\nworkflow, and so on because I've upgraded to a new version of foo which doesn't\nsupport option X any more or requires library Y version N+1 now.<p>Getting a new computer should be a <i>pleasant</i> experience! The unboxing from the\nsleek packaging, that ""new laptop"" smell, the nostalgia of the default desktop\nimage. Why does this horrible step 4 have to exist and how can we get rid of\nit?<p>The Divide\n----------<p>I've noticed something interesting lately: I can categorize almost <i>all</i> of the\nsoftware I use into two distinct groups:<p>* Software that breaks pretty much <i>every</i> time I update it (e.g. weechat,\nofflineimap, Clojure, many Python packages, Skype).\n* Software that almost <i>never</i> breaks when I update it (e.g. Mercurial, git,\ntmux, Python, ack, zsh, Vim, Dropbox).<p>Software that falls in between these two extremes is surprisingly rare. There\nseems to be a pretty clean divide between the two groups.<p>This makes me think that there's some special attribute or quality of the\nsecond group (or its authors) which the first one lacks.<p>Brokenness\n----------<p>I think it's important that I nail down what I mean by ""breaks"" or ""is broken"".\nI don't necessarily just mean the introduction of ""new bugs"".<p>When I say that a program ""breaks"", I mean:<p>* When I update from version X to version Y of a program, library, or language...\n* Without changing my configuration files, source code, etc...\n* The resulting combination doesn't work properly<p>In effect, I'm saying that ""breaking backwards compatibility"" means ""the program\nis broken""!<p>This may be a strong statement, but I stand by it in most cases.<p>Backwards compatibility matters! Every time someone makes a backwards\nincompatible change in a program or library, they cost the world the following\namount of time:<p> Number of people     Time it takes each person\n using that part of   X  to figure out what changed\n the program          and how to fix it<p>Often this can be a significant amount of time!<p>The Process of Updating\n-----------------------<p>When pointing out a backwards incompatible change to someone, you'll often get\na response similar to this:<p> ""Well, I mentioned that backwards incompatibility in the changelog, so what\n the hell, man!""<p>This is not a satisfactory answer.<p>When I'm updating a piece of software there's a good chance it's not because I'm\nspecifically updating <i>that program</i>. I might be:<p>* Moving to a new computer.\n* Running a ""$PACKAGE_MANAGER update"" command.\n* Moving a website to a bigger VPS and reinstalling all the libraries.<p>In those cases (and many others) I'm not reading the release notes for\na specific program or library. I'm not going to find out about the brokenness\nuntil I try to use the program the next time.<p>If I'm lucky the program will have a ""this feature is now deprecated, read the\ndocs"" error message. That's still a pain, but at least it's less confusing than\njust getting a traceback, or worst of all: silently changing the behavior of\na feature.<p>Progress\n--------<p>I completely understand that when moving <i>backwards</i> to an older version\nI should expect problems. The older version hasn't had the benefit of the extra\nwork done on the new version, so of course it should be less stable.<p>But when I'm <i>updating</i> to a higher version number the software should be\n<i>better</i> and <i>more stable</i>! It has had more work done on it, and I assume no\none is actively trying to make software worse, so why does something that\npreviously worked no longer work?<p>We're supposed to be making <i>progress</i> as we move forward. The software has had\n<i>more</i> work done on it, why does it not function correctly <i>now</i> when it\nfunctioned correctly <i>before</i>?<p>Yes, this means developers will need to add extra code to handle old\ninput/configuration. Yes, this is a pain in the ass, but <i>the entire point of\nmost software is to save people time by automating things</i>. Again, every\nbackwards-incompatible change costs the world an amount of time:<p> Number of people     Time it takes each person\n using that part of   X   to figure out what changed\n the program         and how to fix it<p>If our goal is to <i>save time</i> then we should not make changes that <i>cost time</i>.\nOr at least we should not make such changes lightly.<p>A Culture of Sadness\n--------------------<p>Proof that this is a real issue can be found in the tools we use every day. As\nprogrammers we've invented elaborate dependency systems to deal with it.<p>We say ""pip install django==1.3"" or put ""[clojure ""1.2""]"" in our Leiningen\nproject.clj files to avoid using the newest versions because they'll break.<p>Step back and look at this for a second.<p>What the hell?<p>What the <i>hell</i>?<p>We have invented software with features designed to help us use <i>old</i> versions\nof other software!<p>We have <i>written code</i> to <i>avoid</i> using the ""latest and greatest"" software!<p>Obviously this is not entirely bad, but the fact that manually specifying\nversion numbers to avoid running <i>newer</i> code is commonplace, expected, and\na ""best practice"" horrifies me.<p>I would <i>love</i> to be able to say something like this in my requirements.txt and\nproject.clj files:<p> Of <i>course</i> I want the latest version of library X! I want <i>all</i> the\n newest bug fixes and improvements!<p>Unfortunately I can't do that right now because so many projects make backwards\nincompatible changes all the time.<p>The moment I try to build the project at some point in the future I'll be sent\non a wild goose chase to figure out what function moved into what other\nnamespace and what other function was split into its own library and dammit the\ndocumentation on the project's website is autogenerated from the tip of its git\nrepo and so it doesn't apply to the latest actual version and jesus christ\nI think I'll just quit programming and teach dance full time instead even though\nI'll go hungry.<p>The Tradeoff\n------------<p>One could argue that sometimes backwards incompatible changes cost time up front\nbut save time in the long run by making the software more ""elegant"" and ""lean"".<p>While I'm sure there are cases where this is true, I feel like it's a cop out\nmost of the time. Allow me to illustrate this with a helpful Venn diagram:<p>                 -------\n                 /3333333\\n                |333333333|\n                 \3333333/\n                 -------<p> 11 -> People who give a shit what a program's codebase\n 11  looks like.<p> 22 -> The authors of said program.\n 22<p>For libraries where the author is the only user, none of this rant applies.\nYou're free! Break as much as you like!<p>For the majority of libraries, however, there are probably vastly more ""users""\nthan ""authors"". Saving a few hours of the authors' own time has to be weighed\nagainst the 10 minutes each that the hundreds of users will have to spend\nfiguring out what happened and working around it.<p>I want to be clear: being backwards compatible <i>doesn't</i> mean sacrificing new\nfeatures! New features can still be added! Refactoring can still happen!<p>In most cases keeping backwards compatibility simply means maintaining a bit of\nwrapper code to support people using the previous version.<p>For example: in Python, if we moved the public foo() function to a new module,\nwe'd put the following line in the original module:<p> from newmodule import new_foo as foo<p>Is it pretty? Hell no! But this single line of code will probably save more\npeople more time than most of the other lines in the project!<p>This may just be an artifact of how my brain is wired, but I actually get\na sense of satisfaction from writing code that bridges the gap between older\nversions and new.<p>I can almost hear a little voice in my head saying:<p> ""Mwahaha, I'll slip this refactoring past them and they'll never even know\n it happened!""<p>Maybe it's just me, but I think that ""glue"" code can be clever and beautiful in\nits own right.<p>It may not bring a smile to anyone's face like a shiny new feature, but it\nprevents many frowns instead, and preventing a frown makes the world a happier\nplace just as much as creating a smile!<p>Exceptions\n----------<p>One case where I feel the backwards incompatibility tradeoff <i>is</i> worth it is\nsecurity.<p>A good example of this is Django's change which made AJAX requests no longer be\nexempt from CSRF checks. It was backwards incompatible and I'm sure it broke\nsome people's projects, but I think it was the right thing to do because it\nimproved security.<p>I also think it's unreasonable to expect all software to be perfectly ready from\nits first day.<p>Sometimes software needs to get poked and prodded in the real world before it's\nfully baked, and until then requiring strict backwards compatibility will do\nmore harm than good.<p>By all means, backwards compatibility should be thrown to the wind in the first\nstage of a project's life. At the beginning it needs to find its legs, like\na baby gazelle on the Serengeti. But at some point the project needs to get its\nbalance, grow up, and start concerning itself with backwards compatibility.<p>But when should that happen?<p>A Solution\n----------<p>I think there's a simple, intuitive way to mark the transition of a piece of\nsoftware from ""volatile"" to ""stable"":<p> Version 1.0<p>Before version 1, software can change and evolve rapidly with no regards for\nbreaking, but once that first number becomes ""greater than or equal to 1"" it's\ntime to be a responsible member of the software community and start thinking\nabout the real humans whose time gets wasted for every breaking change.<p>This is the approach semantic versioning takes, and I think it's the right one.<p>I know a lot of people dislike semantic versioning. They hate how requires\nincrementing the major version number every time a breaking change is made.<p>I consider it to be a <i>good</i> thing.<p>You <i>should</i> pause and carefully consider making a change that will break\npeople's current code.<p>You <i>should</i> be ashamed if your project is at version 43.0.0 because you've made\n42 breaking changes. That's 43 times you've disregarded your users' time!\nThat's a bad thing!<p>As programmers we need to start caring about the people we write software for.<p>Before making a change that's going to cause other people pain, we should ask\nourselves if it's really worth the cost. Sometimes it is, but many times it's\nnot, and we can wrap the change up so it doesn't hurt anyone.<p>So please, before you make that backwards incompatible change, think of the\nother human beings who are going to smack their monitors when your software\nbreaks.<p>Further Reading\n---------------<p>I'm certainly not the only person to notice this problem. Many smarter people\nthan me have talked about it. If you want to read more you might want to look\nup some or all of the following (Google is your friend):<p>* The Semantic Versioning spec (the specific numbering details don't matter as\nmuch as the philosophy).\n* Anything Matt Mackall has written on the Mercurial mailing list (especially\nthe mails where he sounds especially grouchy).\n* Anything about ""software rot"" or ""code rot"".<p>Steve Losh\nsteve@stevelosh.com<p>==============================================<p>Unsubscribe nishadt15@gmail.com from this list:\nhttp://thelistserve.us4.list-manage2.com/unsubscribe?u=04ff6ad5f890a74d856b58123&id=14e28a9b65&e=6f3a2e4f80&c=8ceb5fe514<p>@thelistserve\nhttp://thelistserve.com\nfacebook.com/thelistserve",1335123976

I've owned about 20 headphone amps over the years that cost between $50 - $2500.  Some of these amps have serial numbers in the double digits, many hand-built PTP tube amps, and the designers tend to be pretty transparent about the numbers sold, as many are headphone enthusiasts themselves and they come from the DIY-world then transition into small businesses.

There have been tons of Kickstarter-esque pre-orders threads on head-fi, where a well-known designer has a goal of selling something like 100-500 amps before beginning production and offers early-bird discounts.  Usually the product in question changes the game in some way whether it comes to sonics/power/battery life/portability (if we're talking about portables).<p>It's a poor assumption that novelty-factor is high on the list of an audiophile.  As cool as this design is, what it does does not add any functionality or utility to the amp. At the extreme upper end sure novelty may become more of a factor.  But even when you get to kilobuck amps the component and labor costs are still quite high, ie. the designer of a $5000 amp usually has $2500 sunk into the amp, and he might sell a dozen of them.  And to do that, the company has to have a ton of cachet in the industry.<p>There is a very large and active community around headphone audio if you're interested in this field... in excess of a quarter million members with about 10M posts - <a href=""http://www.head-fi.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.head-fi.org/</a>.  I've been an active member there for over 7 years and into this hobby for over a decade. I've hosted a meet with about 30 members w/ almost $100k in equipment.  I personally have owned over $20k in equipment over the years.  I think I can speak with some authority on this.",1335122944

Perhaps the underlying societal problem is that many hold in contempt ideas too complex for sound bite summarization?  So, changes in the ways we converse are merely a symptom of this underlying change?  How many times have you watched a televised interview or sat in a meeting as someone was explaining an idea and become angered when the speaker was interrupted -- not to clarify, but to change the topic?  I find myself saying in my head, ""Let him speak!"" I have no problem with others silencing some babbling fool, but to shut someone up simply because the idea at hand requires nuanced explanation severely limits the spectrum of ideas we ever will be able to consider.<p>Perhaps, much like when people don't stand up and say something when another makes a bigoted joke, those of us sitting silently are partially to blame?  I often say, ""I'd really like to hear more about what Suzy thinks!"", but only ""often"" in that I do so much more frequently than others.

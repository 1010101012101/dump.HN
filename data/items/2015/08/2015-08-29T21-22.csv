From what I saw, the team really wants to build a great product and is extremely passionate about what they do.<p>Sure they have flashy marketing and throw the word AI around a lot. Clearly its working better than “Hey we use automated A/B testing, analytics, fluid auto-changing layouts, dynamic color schemes, and whole bunch of cool photo filters to tie together a unique website based on your content!”<p>Regarding the delays, I think the same would be true for any startup with really good pre order sales, who is feeling the mounting pressure to meet the bar they have set for themselves. This is called caring about your work.<p>I think the author is misguided here and took liberties on what The Grid is actually promising.

[I&#x27;m excluding Curious Pasttimes, since I have no data, but suspect it&#x27;s also 1000+]. Typically Empire (which I play and have a better idea of numbers) has around 1500 people: around 1300 players and 200 crew.<p>Empire is interesting from a Megagame perspective because it places the players as the movers and shakers of the world and then gives them the levers of power -- there are senators dealing with the temporal politics of a ten-nation Empire, the synod wrestling for the protection of man&#x27;s mortal soul, the mages who bargain for power from the alien beings from outside Creation or for those aliens to not deal with the Empire&#x27;s enemies. And it&#x27;s on a timescale of four weekends a year, for years, rather than a one-off game. (This isn&#x27;t even the only large LARP they run -- I believe their mythological era Odyssey game is several hundreds of players)<p>And as the comments of the article say; Germany has some epic LARPs too -- and pretty sure other places do too.<p>That said, I&#x27;d love to play in one of these tightly plotted megagames...<p>[full disclosure: I play Empire, have played Odyssey, and played Lorien Trust a long time ago and wasn&#x27;t a massive fan.

10141452,comment,10126805,10139235,0,0,tel,,,"I think given your clarification here I can directly state that (a) I don&#x27;t think this is necessary and (b) I don&#x27;t think C-H is a good name for this exactly. Point (b) is a bit silly to discuss, but point (a) is key.<p>I think there are <i>workflow</i> and <i>ux</i> efficiencies for having the compiler reject programs which are poorly typed. This typing can arise from either internal or external verifications for all I care, but the ergonomics of each vary a lot as well.<p>I think for both practical and ergonomic reasons, completely automated proofs are weak. There&#x27;s no reason <i>not</i> to run them if you agree with the validity and importance of the theorem they represent, but by their nature the meaning and effectiveness is highly limited.<p>By having your proving language align with your programming language you sidestep this issue by forcing everyone&#x27;s hand into revealing their intentions to the verifier. From a process perspective, this keeps people from cheating (&quot;whip and bondage and all that&quot;) and it <i>also</i>, <i>more imprtantly</i> encourages the code author to tell a complete story of what they&#x27;re doing instead of merely creating the artifact. This is <i>great</i> for the more &quot;conversational&quot; style of proving that occurs with things like Agda, Coq, Epigram.<p>External proofs can act similarly but I think your examples are often really archaic. It seems to me that I nteresting theorems must be derived alongside your program be they internal or external. JonPRL is an interesting demonstration of this method (as is NuPRL, but you can&#x27;t really access that one).",1440885222

I didn&#x27;t want to make a long post even longer, but I will try to clarify without hopefully writing stuff that&#x27;s too obtusely theological. :)<p>Christ says that one of the greatest expressions of love is to die for a friend. But who is it that dies for one&#x27;s enemy? Yet this is what Christ does for humanity, forgiving them even while hanging upon the cross, and it is what He calls all Christians to offer to their enemies.<p>One way I think of this is that there is one mode of living, which I&#x27;ll call economic, where we do things in order to receive things. That&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve described in &quot;if it makes others likely to cover for your sins as well&quot;. But what the Christian tries to live, what St. Silouan the Athonite would term theanthropic living, is that of humility: of loving even when there is no chance of receiving a reward. One might argue that in this other mode of life, one is awaiting some kind of heavenly reward. But I don&#x27;t think that is the case because as one approaches God closer, one sees just how _unlike_ God one is; as a saint has said &quot;none of the saints have counted themselves worthy of Heaven.&quot;<p>What I mean is that in approaching God we become aware in the depths of our heart of our fundamental wrongness towards others and toward God, and the great darkness that lies within ourselves. This isn&#x27;t some kind of masochistic pleasure in self-hatred. It&#x27;s an awareness that penetrates one&#x27;s entire being. And _balancing this recognition_ is that God Himself loves us even unto death. Despite this incredible self-awareness, we are indeed not lost. Even more than that, we are empowered to become like God (theosis). The result of this is the joyful sadness of the theanthropic life: one accounts only oneself as deserving of death, while one sees all others as worthy of the Kingdom of Heaven. And really, this is what Christ Himself did in His life, His death, and His descent into Hades. But Hades could not contain God, and St. Silouan says that death also cannot contain any truly theanthropic person, for they become blameless. This is how death becomes the gateway to divine life.<p>Perhaps there is a rational way to justify suffering and even dying at the hands of one&#x27;s enemy. I&#x27;d honestly be interested in hearing such an argument!",1440884466

10141392,comment,10139144,10141002,0,0,muraiki,,,"One of the difficulties in engaging in theological discussions is that we all come to the table with different interpretations of particular terms and ideas. I know that I began this discussion by criticizing one interpretation, but that is because the author&#x27;s interpretation of the tree as containing scientific knowledge seemed to directly contradict the very name of the tree. What I present here is what the Orthodox Church has taught, rooted in ideas from St. Ignatius, a bishop in the first century. I say this not as some kind of appeal to authority, but only to make clear that what I express has been upheld and refined for nearly 2000 years.<p>In the Orthodox Church, &quot;original sin&quot; isn&#x27;t some sort of inherited guilt. Adam and Eve bear the guilt for their actions; the _ramification_ of their actions resulted in the disordering of all the cosmos, which is what all of humanity has sadly inherited. The Catholic (or perhaps more specifically Augustinian) idea that all share in the guilt of Adam is what leads to ideas like Christ needing to be a propitiatory sacrifice to appease an angry God. This idea is inconceivable in the Orthodox church. Nor does Christ exist only to reconcile original sin; He has always existed, and Orthodox theologians have said that if the fall had not occurred He still would have taken on flesh for the sake of uniting Himself with humanity.<p>It is this union in the Incarnation that makes humans &quot;divine&quot;: Christ is fully God and fully man; as St. Ignatius said, &quot;God became man so that man might become like God.&quot; If the intent was only to &quot;get people to heaven,&quot; meaning to put them in some specific place after death, then there were certainly easier ways to accomplish this. But God has in His eyes the beautification of His beloved.<p>Christ&#x27;s life is a perfect illustration not only of God&#x27;s love but of the way in which all who follow Christ are empowered to walk. What we see in the Incarnation, Transfiguration, and Resurrection is what humanity is truly capable of: a love so powerful that it can annihilate death.",1440883371

It was pretty puritanical in the American sense, so nearly all the long time anime posters got banned for being &quot;probably a pedophile&quot;.

If you want to use Haskell as a nice functional language with a great typesystem.<p>As spopejoy says, Monad is a typeclass, that means every Monad is a type on itself. So you you can get by just learning every monad for its use without ever needing to know the theory that binds them.<p>The Maybe Monad is just an option type, the list monad is just a list and the IO monad is just a sequence of operations that gets returned to the runtime from the main function. Who cares that they all share a typeclass?",1440882294

The best known way to enforce honest participation in this mechanism is by requiring workers (miners) to prove that they&#x27;ve expended resources (incurred a cost) in order to to be eligible to publish the next block and claim the block reward + transactions fees.<p>When a miner Finds a valid hash for a block, they prove that they&#x27;ve consumed a certain amount of electricity in a way they everyone can easily verify. In order for someone to perform a 51% attack, they have to use more electricity than everyone else, which is probably more expensive than just participating honestly. The security of the network is proportional to the amount of money it costs to attack it.<p>Mining is therefore neither wasteful nor inefficient, if it is understood that the goal is to have a decentralized, censorship-free currency that disincentivizes attacks.",1440882098

2695122,comment,2693234,2693461,2,0,Dn_Ab,,,"If i understand correctly collect is more like map from functional programing languages and inject is a fold. One maps a collection of one type to a collection of another type, and the other reduces a collection of one type into something of another type (which could be a collection itself) in that case MapReduce does not quite translate to ruby's collect and inject. In fancy language the reduce in MapReduce is not merely a catamorphism nor is the map actually a collect. The types do not align.

What is called map is actually more a reverse reduce. The pedagogical emphasis on map and foldr actually belies the true nature and power of algorithm in parallelizing.",1308984378

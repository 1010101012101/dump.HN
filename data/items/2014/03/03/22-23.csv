We are in Canada, where salaries typically are lower than the tech hubs of the US. Like most companies, we don&#x27;t post salary ranges for the positions in the job posting itself, rather wait till we talk with the person face to face. I should mention that our typical interview process is phone first, followed by bringing them in for in-person technical interviews (we also do mock projects and coding assignments, not really relevant here).<p>Recently we have started mentioning the expected salary range at the phone interview itself, since we had a few cases where we flew people in, only for our salary expectations to be pretty different, hence a waste of time. We of course need to balance between paying top dollar for the best, versus managing the budget.<p>Here&#x27;s my question: what does HN think about pushing this salary transparency all the way, and putting it in the job description itself, so neither of us wastes time with false expectations?",1393887501

7337150,comment,7336980,7336980,2,0,derekp7,,,"So here&#x27;s the problem that I have with most of these types of cases, where police don&#x27;t follow proper procedure to capture a suspect.  Let&#x27;s say they went through normal procedures -- get a sketch artist to make a possibly inaccurate caricature of the suspect, and use that to make an arrest, and have the victim ID the suspect.  This has a good chance of convicting the wrong person.  First, if the sketch is inaccurate, the victim may have that image in there mind afterwards, which would influence picking out the suspect from a lineup.<p>Now, using the alternative procedure, in which the police are tracking down the victim&#x27;s stolen phone (I&#x27;m assuming with the victim&#x27;s blessing), there is a much higher chance of getting the right suspect.<p>So, how do you argue with someone that the police should use inferior (but legal) evidence to put the (possibly wrong) person away, instead of using more accurate (but 4&#x27;th amendment violating) evidence to get the right person?  Now in cases where proper procedure always gives superior evidence, then it is easier to argue for that (such as standards for collecting DNA evidence to avoid contamination).  But in other cases, it is possible that unauthorized methods can lead police away from an innocent person and toward the guilty one.",1393887365

QE didn&#x27;t cause increasing demand for oil in China. The price of food and fuel would have gone up relative to other things regardless. Inflation from an increase in money supply will manifest in a way that cuts across industry sectors. Cars, computers, and personal services would be getting more expensive.

7337037,comment,7334269,7336067,3,0,lmm,,,"Well the article&#x27;s talking about having a way to safely install software - my general view is that while UAC and firewall-type mechanisms mean malware authors need to be more careful, they don&#x27;t provide any firm security guarantees. So if an attacker can get you to run an executable they&#x27;ve provided, even as a non-admin user, they win. If you download executables over HTTP, and run them without taking steps to verify them, you are likely vulnerable; signature-based virus scanners are not to be relied upon, and any malware scan run <i>after</i> you run the program could at least in theory be defeated - if nothing else, by a Blue Pill-style hypervisor.<p>Now, how realistic a danger a HTTP MITM is it depends on your threat model; I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s doing this on a large scale (other than governments in places like Iran and North Korea). But if you&#x27;re worried about attackers targeting you specifically, then I think this is a valid threat vector.<p>MS tried to address this in earlier windows with digital signing of downloads (you get a warning if you try to run an unsigned executable, and a different warning identifying the publisher for a signed one, assuming the executable in question is marked as having been downloaded from the internet), and by integrating an app store into windows 8 (I think?). If done correctly, this would prevent this kind of attack - if you only ever run signed executables, and you trust the signers, you&#x27;re safe. But the fact that even PuTTY, supposedly a piece of security software, is an unsigned download, suggests that this approach hasn&#x27;t really spread through the windows software ecosystem yet. (The other approach that might work is extending UAC into some kind of full containerization approach, and isolating applications more fully from each other).",1393886104

In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.&quot;<p>I still can&#x27;t fathom how meritocracy can be taken as anything but a negative. I mean, the first question that comes to mind (or, rather, the second after &quot;what is merit&quot;) is, &quot;who has merit and why, and who does not?&quot; Once this question is asked, it is immediately apparent that any attempt to paint &quot;meritocracy&quot; in a positive light is ludicrous.",1393885100

They are important, because using the definition is tiresome and error prone.<p>The main idea of derivation is that each function f has an associated function f&#x27; that is the slope of the tangent lines. This is new function is useful to describe some properties of the original function. (Approximation by the tangent line, increasing and decreasing intervals, ...)<p>It interesting to use the intuitive idea of derivation to understand some of the rules, for example (f+g)&#x27;=f&#x27;+g&#x27;. Something like:<p><i>If when x increase 1 unit, f increases approximately 3 units and g increases approximately 2 units, then the sum increases approximately 5 units. If f or g are too curved we need to analyze smaller steps like increasing x in 0.1 units. Now f increases only approximately 0.3 units, but the rate of increment is still approximately 3, ...</i> (It&#x27;s much easier with a graph and hand waving.)<p>And in an advanced course it&#x27;s important to transform this intuitive idea into a formal proof.<p>Another interesting example is the discussion of where is the minimum of x^2+16/x. The general form of x^2 is well known (graph) and also the general form of 16/x (graph) and then it&#x27;s possible to draw x^2+16/x approximately (graph). The minimum is where the rate of increment of x^2 is equal to the rate of decrement of 16/x, so x^2+16/x is &quot;horizontal&quot; in that point. This is an intuitive idea, and is exactly what 0=(f+g)&#x27;=f&#x27;+g&#x27; says. In a class you can do the formal calculation of the derivative of x^2+16/x. Then find the exact value of x. Show it in the graph. (Explain that the graphs are approximations, so it&#x27;s not strange that the minimum in the graph is slightly bigger. Ask if they have a graphic calculator?)

But at the estimated speed -- &quot;more than 100 MPH&quot; -- more than 500 feet would have been required and just wasn&#x27;t there, before a sharp turn they didn&#x27;t manage.<p>> Most fatalities are not because the car drove straight into a stationary object directly in front of them on the road.<p>Yes, but all such accidents involve cars hitting each other or objects along the road, or rolling over during efforts to stop them, and similar causes. All these examples involve energy management, and in each case, the driver couldn&#x27;t safely dissipate the car&#x27;s kinetic energy.<p>> Collisions mostly happen because of the actions of car drivers who are going roughly the same speed as you.<p>Not in any number of cases, like crossing over the center divider, or hitting a roadside object, or losing control in bad weather, or fog collisions, etc. etc..<p>And even if two cars have a relatively low-speed collision while both traveling at high speed, then the problem becomes controlling the cars after the collision and avoiding hitting other cars or obstacles, many of which are are stationary.<p>> Not saying that speed is a factor, just that stopping distance isn&#x27;t the thing.<p>Of course it is. If you want to avoid crashing into another car, you have to maintain a safe distance. If your car is carrying too much kinetic energy, you can&#x27;t dissipate the energy in advance of getting intimate with the other car, or a tree, or a center divider through which you roll your car uncontrollably.<p>> Perhaps you should discuss kinetic energy instead?<p>Say what? How did you miss the kinetic energy equation I included in the post to which you&#x27;re replying? I even included the words &quot;kinetic energy&quot; to avoid any possible confusion.",1393884559

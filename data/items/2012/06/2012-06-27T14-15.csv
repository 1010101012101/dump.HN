This is about Netflix not being able to give videos without CC to anybody, and/or being required to put CC on videos that they were not provided with CC for and, as they say, actually can't CC without violating copyright law (though one imagines that if they are found to be required to add CC that their licensing contract will simply grow a new clause).<p>I mention this because I just read over all the comments as I post this, and nobody else seems to have mentioned this.

Are you not?<p>Not exactly, but it's like that. I can say that their vision is greatly widened because they see from a much higher level. There are some things they can see which are very distant, and sometimes they can help people who are also very distant, using their power of consciousness. However, I've heard Tathagata say he doesn't use his mind very much, and that he simply sees everything that is inside an object when it is in front of him.<p>There are many people who claim the ability to see through walls and tell where other people are (mediums). They do that by letting their consciousness contact and receive information latent inside energy that's in the air. They call that wandering energy by terms like spirits, ghosts, dead souls, etc. However, besides the fact that it can be very unreliable and dangerous to do so, a living Buddha never keeps company with the dead, and only informs people of what he saw with his own eyes.<p>> Please tell us what questions you are asking as a qualifier on whether or not someone is enlightened.<p>Answered this in a sibling question, let me know if you're left with any unanswered questions",1340808509

Making it a law made it standard in the industry. Disabled parking spots cost more than regular because of the extra markings and signage.  Ramps cost most than stairs. Even if the cost is just 1% - 5% more, that cost has to be absorbed by the business owner and over time, businesses have learnt to take that into consideration.<p>Other countries where ADA or equivalent laws do not exist, do not have ramps, special parking spots, or similar accommodations for the disabled. Ramps are not standard there. It is a challenge for my cousin's family in India to take him ANYWHERE because he is in a wheelchair. Some elevators are so small that even the smallest wheelchairs don't fit. Most parks, malls, and other public places usually have no ramps so his wheelchair has to be carried with him in it. ADA makes the lives of disabled individuals and their caretakers better.<p>The question is, does the Internet need an ADA? I myself am split on that.

4167153,story,,,3,2,briancody,"The non-glamorous side of disrupting an industry",,"My name's Brian. I'm doing a PhD in Sociology at the University of Chicago. Academia is a mess of contradictions. It's a fantastic place with brilliant, quick witted people, and at the same time chock-full of irrationality. Here's an example: academic produce work, give it to publishers for free, and then have it sold back to them at a huge markup. How does this work? Academics do a lot of work for free. They serve as journal editors for free. They peer review knowledge for free. They copyedit and improve collections of articles to publish...for free. These collections of articles are then handed off to huge corporate entities that sell this research back to university libraries for billions. Yep, effing billions. The disgust with the current system has even made it to the popular media: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/science/researchers-boycott-elsevier-journal-publisher.html, http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/23/2969913/harvard-library-advisory-council-journal-open-access, and http://www.economist.com/node/18744177/.<p>About a year ago two colleagues of mine and I decided to do something about it - fight the good fight, disrupt an industry, rah-rah-rah. While our backgrounds are in Sociology, Political Philosophy, and History, we also happen to have the know-how to develop web apps. So we created Scholastica (www.ScholasticaHQ.com), a platform that allows any scholar to create, manage, and publish their own academic journals. We give scholars the infrastructure to accept submissions, find reviewers, get articles reviewed, get decisions made on these articles, and then get them published online. You can see an example of what a journal running on Scholastica looks like, here: http://scholasticahq.com/the-scholastica-example-journal<p>While our app isn't perfect by any means and there are still problems to solve, you would think it'd be easy to get people to notice us, especially in that academics are complaining ad nauseum that they hate the current system, right? Wrong. While we're enabling any scholar to set up their own journal and manage it how scholars want, sites like PeerJ (which is only a single journal and not even out yet) have gotten into every publication imaginable. I guess that's what it's like to have Tim O'Reilly in your corner. Academics who aren't even in the bio/medical sciences are talking about PeerJ though it doesn't affect their field. The mind boggles.<p>The moral of this story is you should find a need, try to solve it, and realize you still have to knock on every door in order to get the people you want to help to realize you've spent a great deal of time trying to provide a solution to the thing they're always complaining about. We've had some great feedback and some early adopters which have made a difference, but our experience reiterates the tech startup heuristic ""If you build it, they won't come""  at least not in droves, and not until some big names adopt the platform first.",1340808084

This rewrite would take an indeterminate amount of time whereas they could have paid a paltry sum for the upgrade and implemented it in less than 48 hours... as they just did.<p>I get that it's a prioritization issue. I've worked at places where legacy software had poor security practices and it's often a judgment call as to the risk of just letting it be vs. taking the time to rewrite whatever insecure portion remained. Often the decision is to leave it when it's a one-off project that will be shut down within a month, there is a limited attack surface involved, and the data being stored insecurely is very low value. On the other hand, security issues affecting the very core of a website (the login system that 100% of a company's revenue depends on) should get addressed as soon as the vulnerability is discovered. Additionally, they state that a server was compromised... it's not clear whether this was a SQL injection exploit that happened to display the users table remotely with no privilege escalation, or whether the server was compromised via a poorly chosen SSH password or similar and they may be dealing with a situation where rogue code is still living on one or more servers.",1340808072

Don't buy space that you aren't going to need but compare prices and find out about options for expansion.

Don't say ""I'll fix that later"".<p>* This goes hand in hand with the previous: If  everything has redundant power, are you going to run out of outlets before you fill your space? Consider installing a metered PDU (or PDUs) before you add any machines<p>* You probably don't need 2U servers.

The page barely works with JS off, so I'd hate to imagine how a user with a screen reader would use it.<p>As for IE7 users, you may be right, but it is my experience that sites that are the size of airbnb can happily spend 10,000 to make your site work in older browsers, because they'll get that amount back from new customers very quickly.<p>Whether you like to develop for legacy browsers or not is irrelevant.

4167120,comment,4163124,4166416,-1,0,blueprint,,,"The wall is that we first have to know what Enlightenment is very correctly to check if something meets the criteria for Enlightenment. The way to verify what something is, lies in the results it makes - just like our example of a fruit tree. Seeds and leaves may look similar across an apple, plum, and cherry, but we know instantly what it is when we see, smell, and taste the fruit.<p>I've reported Master Tathagata's definition that Enlightenment is 'the opening of one's eyes to the world'. He's also said that Supreme Enlightenment (that of a Tathagata) is opening eyes to reality completely. So the first thing is - ask them any questions in reality - if they are unable to give the answer that can be verified in the reality (if they cannot realize what is in reality) then they have not completed their Enlightenment.<p>A second thing I'll leave with you is like this. A bodhisattva cannot have attained Enlightenment completely - because if s/he had, then the one would be a Buddha.Yet it seems that a Buddha only comes to the world once every 3,000 years or so. 
The term of Bodhisattva means ""gods who have good power and are seeking for the truth"". (Sorry cannot cite as it was in yet-untranscribed audio from Tathagata) They protect Buddha, but could not remove their karma totally yet, so they are still seekers. However, sometimes some Bodhisattvas who have a power to stop their karma can get into the same dimension that the Buddhas reside in (paradise). So the second thing to check is whether they claim they are Enlightened. It's a red flag to me.<p>The third thing is that an Enlightened Being never lies. Instead, they bet their life every day in order to inform people of the truth - this is the proof of their love for mankind, and it is the greatest teaching. So your continuous verification of what people say (imho, according to the facts in the world) is essential whether or not the person actually has evidence that they know truth, or is telling a lie.<p>Hope this helps",1340807763

If they succeed, then shame on Netflix for missing an opportunity.

Looking back on these kinds of discussions, many times people who watched trends and worried about underlying philosophical problems got it right -- but only after decades or perhaps centuries have passed. Usually things come along and all the old folks say it's terrible, all the young folks think it's awesome, and not much is accomplished. Fundamental changes also fit into this pattern, but the problems never show up in any reasonable amount of time for people to remember who gave the warnings. So we forget. I could use a lot of examples, but the arguments against the ratification of the Constitution of the United States come to mind. All of the arguments against the structure were panned as being wild absurd fantasies: that there would be a standing army, that the government would consistently overspend, that the federal government would take more and more control from the states, and so on.<p>They all turned out to be true, but the ""winners"" of these arguments lost in the short term and weren't around to see how prescient they were. As these trends continue it's the rest of us, many generations later, that have to deal with the problems that were easily foretold at the beginning.<p>So it might not be 40 years. Might be 100.

4167056,comment,4164941,4166849,1,0,zhoutong,,,"> And yeah, under my system market making actually requires work/risk, not just riskless front running. The free lunch is gone. That is the point. There would be less volume. Buyers and sellers would trade slightly slower trade execution (waiting for the auction interval) for the benefit of not paying any tax to market makers.<p>The spread earned by market makers is definitely not a tax. They earn the money from (increased volume * reduced spread). Suppose you anticipate AAPL will rise from $600 to $601 based on your fundamental/technical analysis. If there're no market makers, the wouldn't be enough liquidity to inspire any confidence to take the trade. The order book would be like:<p><pre><code>            601.00  3
            600.50  1
  5  600.00
  2  599.00
</code></pre>
There's no point to make that $1. It's simply too risky. If there are a buyer and a seller they both want to trade 1 share instantly. They pay $0.50 in total to liquidity providers in the market (compared to private settling).<p>If there are lots of market makers, the order book would look like this:<p><pre><code>               600.10  950
               600.05  401
  1200  600.00
   450  599.95
</code></pre>
Of course, you will choose to trade and make the $1 if market moves as expected (and a lot of people will make similar decisions). At this time, if a buyer and a seller comes, they will pay $0.05 in total to market makers compared to private settling.<p>I know that your original intent is to make the ""private settling"" option available in the market by aggregating all orders in an interval and execute at once. If that really happens, the order book (which is hidden from public) will look like this:<p><pre><code>            600.50  2
            600.00  3
  5  601.00
  2  600.00
</code></pre>
Execution price: $600.60 (Weighted average of overlapping orders). Volume: 5 shares.<p>In this case, it seems that both the buyer and the seller received a benefit. But actually it's not true. If your aim is to make profit by selling at $601, rationally you will keep buying until the price reaches $601. The maximum price you're willing to pay is actually $601. However, when you see a selling order at $600, you will place a $600 buy order instead (and you pretend to have a demand only at $600 or below because you know it will be fulfilled anyway). In a non-continuous system, you're forced to signal your true demand at $601 so that you are able to take advantage of favourable prices when you're lucky (and orders get executed only when you're lucky).<p>> If the market was as jump and irrational as you think it would be hedge funds would make a killing by being smart and rational, until enough entered the market with standing limit orders that the price smoothed out.<p>They are exactly market makers. The market will be ""jump and irrational"" without these market makers, especially when everyone signals their true demand. That's why black-box auctions usually yield much higher prices than public auctions when people are rational (i.e. not counting the emotional effects of public bidding). It's just how market works. Similar concepts can apply to free rider problem as well (for public goods). You know that the national military can provide you security worth $1,000 a year, but obviously you pretend to be unwilling to pay anything when the service can only be provided for free. Market equilibrium price quickly reaches $0 with no guess work.<p>The way market works makes the prices very predictable. Even the flash crashes are smooth (<i>with</i> the market makers). The ""riskless front running"" is a symbol of market competition. Yes, some guys are going to offer you one cent better, they should have the priority in the queue.<p>I don't want to comment on the influence in economic activity. What I know is, more liquidity = less risk for holding shares. What market makers earn is not a tax. It comes from the money that bigger market makers will earn anyway ($0.01 spread with 50 shares traded vs $0.50 spread with 1 share traded).",1340807055

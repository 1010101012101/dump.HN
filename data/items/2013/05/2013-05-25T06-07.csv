Quantitatively, I love to see program benchmarks to test.<p>I am particularly interested in the insertion performance. While insertion may not seem cheap, it seems the benefits of locality and large block operations may keep the performance competitive.

5766586,comment,5763832,5765188,2,0,parasubvert,,,"I think it is easier in Austria (my mother was born there).  In Vienna, with a reasonable flat and public transportation, you probably don't have a lot of extra costs.   I'm not sure what the Austrian parental leave policy is... one year?  How much salary do they cover?<p>Sources of capital expense for US/Canada:<p>- Parental leave.  Most social insurance systems do not pay full salary if you make over a certain amount of money (say, $40,000 annually).  If your lifestyle is higher than that, you need to save the excess.  In Canada, parental leave is usually up to 1 year.   In the USA, it is often 2 to 3 months (though some insurance plans allow for longer).<p>- If you're both working, daycare can cost $600 to upwards of $1500 monthly, depending on quality & city.<p>- Depending on the child, if you want to actually sleep at night it helps for the child to have their own room by age 1 to 1.5 or so, which may entail a larger flat or house.   Other children are not restless sleepers and can be tolerable in a shared room.<p>- Otherwise, the usual expenditure, depending on your desired lifestyle and travel needs: car seats ($500+), booster seats ($200+), clothes, toys, diapers, child-proof cupboard door clips, strollers (upwards of $1000 if you're getting a multi-purpose Chariot-type carrier)<p>So I'd say, a middle class family would often be advised to save at least $10,000 before having a child.   An upper class / affluent family that wants some level of dual parental leave, or a nanny, likely $100,000 or more.<p>There's also the dark side of having a child, and that's the astronomical costs of separation, assuming you want shared custody (or are fighting for primary custody).   In the US or Canada, legal costs are usually at least $10,000 to get to a custody agreement and divorce filing, and more likely $20,000 to 50,000 for minor contentions.  Major custody battles can cost upwards of $500,000 (each).   Legal aid can help, but only if you fall below a certain income threshold.    Whereas I've seen couples split with no kids for under $5,000 each.<p>source:  many friends with children, I have a 3 year old, also too many friends with bad divorces",1369464948

5766555,comment,5764732,5765297,1,0,marcamillion,,,"So there are 2 ways to look at your feedback. You either just saw what you wanted to see in my comment, and responded to that - or you take for granted what she is doing.<p>I never said that ""buying lots of big properties so you can advertise across all of them"" is CEO genius. I said...that Mayer is increasingly showing her genius.<p>It's not about acquiring internet properties...it is the properties that she is choosing to acquire. It's also the fact that those properties are even agreeing to be acquired by her - that is making her feat even more impressive.<p>Nothing is guaranteed to be a slam-dunk. Many of these acquisitions may turn out to be duds or not as good as we (who want to see Mayer succeed) hope.<p>>* It's something that Yahoo was doing for years before Meyer even came on board- they bought Flickr and Delicious, and tried to buy Facebook.*<p>I think that statement alone is an indication to the genius that is Mayer. Yahoo tried to buy Facebook for a similar $1B back in the day, and was rebuffed. Fast forward a few years, and under different leadership a similar deal can be made with a similarly ""hot startup"" and the deal is accepted. Sure, I know there are many factors at play, but the fact of the matter is just a few years ago - Yahoo couldn't make these types of deals. It must be that I am not the only one that thinks she is doing a good job.<p>Also, if what she is doing is not genius, then why did no one else do it like her before? The genius in this situation is not going on a shopping spree willy nilly. She came in, and has clearly looked at Yahoo for what it is. She doesn't seem to be trying to be like Google - although some of the commenters here dispute that. She is steadily, and systematically improving the best of Yahoo and killing the worst. She is also adding properties that will play to Yahoo's strengths.<p>The mere fact that they unveiled a re-design of Flickr that puts pictures front-and-center, while acquiring Tumblr. I think people misunderstand what a brilliant move that is.<p>She refreshed a property that is inherently friendly to ""display media""  (i.e. not link/text based media) - while buying another hot property that is inherently friendly to ""display media"". Once they crack the code, that allows them to add adverts to the content on their network, without sacrificing the quality of the experience too much (i.e. doing to display media what Google did to SERP results).....that could be even more powerful than what Google did - because most brands and agencies prefer display media, because it connects with the audience more.<p>If they spam all their properties with annoying Flash ads then that is an easy way to squander it - but if they figure out a novel/innovative way to monetize this inventory....and she continues to acquire hot properties at the current rate....we could be looking at the most valuable tech company in the next decade. If not most valuable, if you assume that Google doesn't find another major stream of revenue, Yahoo could be worth more than Google at least.<p>You heard it here first ;)<p>Edit: Oh...and also....no serious buyer would pay any amount of series cash for Hulu without reasonable contracts for the content that makes it so appealing. If Mayer does that, that would be a dumb move - unless she knows something we don't....which I don't think that's the case. Given her short track record, I would be surprised (and disappointed) if she did that.",1369463979

It's been <i>thirty fucking years</i>. And yet that crappy little jingle for a company I never used still bubbles up to the surface sometimes, in the shower or in the subway station. We all carry around these little worthless turd fossils in our heads. I noticed my friend humming McDonalds' <i>I'm lovin' it</i> to herself as she worked just 20 minutes ago.<p>Gross.",1369462895

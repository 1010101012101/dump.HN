I&#x27;m playing and making games and most of them run 10% faster on Windows at most, and this is due to graphics driver.<p>However, there is one thing that is a major difference: the system timer. Windows sleep() call has a granularity of 10ms, while OSX one has 1ms. So, if you (or your game library) is using sleep to return unspent CPU time to OS, it&#x27;s easy to write the code that would run fast on one OS and very slow on the other.<p>Most developers treat OSX version as a checkbox on their &quot;required features list&quot; and only care whether the game works or not when porting. They do not want to spend time looking at the intricacies of OSX and just tell you that it&#x27;s graphics driver&#x27;s fault.<p>I develop games on Linux and OSX and later port to Windows before releasing (because that&#x27;s where the players are), so I have to write specific code for Windows to make sure it runs faster.

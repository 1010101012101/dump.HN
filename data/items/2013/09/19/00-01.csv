Ignoring the matter of corruption among the school boards that would choose such courses (take a look at how textbooks are purchased for comparison) and the matter of politcally motivated interests that would undermine whatever market you manage to set up, we do not need the sort of close-to-the-margins, race-to-the-bottom, divide-and-conquer-the-customers approach that markets produce in other fields.  Markets produce the kind of results that evolution produces -- sometimes beautiful things, sometimes disgusting things.<p>Higher education has already been undermined by market-based approaches.  By focusing on what students are willing to buy, universities have lost sight of their academic mission.  You see it in CS departments, where tough courses are watered down, where theoretical topics are pushed aside to make room for vocational training.  You see it in humanities departments, assuming you can even locate them.  You see it in the money spent trying to make schools look like suburban malls during a time when library hours are being curtailed to &quot;save money.&quot;<p>I would also be wary of creating a monoculture, where the most popular curricula become universal and everyone comes out of school with the exact same way of thinking about the world.  There is something to be said for encouraging some amount of diversity in our education system -- which is what happens when teachers develop their own curricula.",1379552353

6409150,comment,6406877,6407506,11,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"Don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are ways of calculating whether a hidden variable is more likely to cause the observational data than the independent variables of your model.<p>A simple example would be a wet lawn. We know rain causes a wet lawn, and our observation shows indeed that rain and wet lawns are strongly associated. However, observing a case where a given lawn is wet, and yet there&#x27;s no associated rain is a clear signal that a latent cause hasn&#x27;t been accounted for (namely sprinklers). This principle still applies in noisy observational data or probabilistic rather than deterministic causal relations, though you do need a bigger sample to reach the same confidence.<p>We also can look at measures of model fitness. If a variation of the model that hypothesizes a latent causal variable is more likely to generate the observed data than the model without it, we know we&#x27;ve missed something. The general case of this is that we learn the model itself from the observed data.<p>This page from Kevin Murphy is a reasonable survey of the methods: <a href=""http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Bayes/bayes.html</a> I also recommend his textbook.",1379552140

The actual fact is that, other than iodine deficiency, malnutrition has to be extreme and prolonged to cause developmental problems. Not even the worst privation of WWII in Europe caused noticeable developmental changes in children compared to the pre- and post-war cohorts.<p>The data on American children show the opposite of starvation. IQs continue to climb, height and growth rate remain high, and the age of puberty continues to fall. This is especially true for the &quot;deprived&quot; Africans in your references, who have the fastest IQ growth of any Americans and an astonishingly low age of puberty (8 and <i>falling</i> for girls).<p>Your references trot out the high rate of welfare handouts to the poorest Africans.

Or better yet, work to improve it! &quot;The SF Government&quot; that makes all these policies that you loathe so much is made up of concerned citizens, much like yourself.<p>* Almost every policy change in at least the past 15 years has resulted in fewer parking spots not more.<p>That&#x27;s an intentional choice to make more walkable neighborhoods. It&#x27;s worked as SF is seen as one of the most walkable cities in the country.[1] This lowers healthcare costs, increases fitness, drives more business to local stores, etc.<p>* We have also instituted policies to reduce housing (rent control)<p>Rent Control was enacted in 1979 and doesn&#x27;t cover any building constructed after that date [2]. That&#x27;s not exactly something we&#x27;ve done in the past 15 years..<p>* [We have also instituted policies to] increase homelessness (city welfare programs & non-profits)<p>Do you honestly believe that providing care for the homeless leads to more homelessness? That&#x27;s a very ugly view of humanity.<p>* [We have also instituted policies to] reduce employment (anti-tech, heavy taxes, fees & regulations)<p>SF just eliminated it&#x27;s payroll tax [3], has tax-free zones for companies who move to underdeveloped parts of the city [4], and some SF supes are on Github [6] with new laws that further reduce fees and streamline ops (especially surrounding SF&#x27;s Open Data initiative [5]). The number of tech jobs has dramatically increased in the city limits and the unemployment rate is almost below 5%. Our &#x27;employment-reducing&#x27; policies don&#x27;t seem to be working very well.<p>* [We have also instituted policies to] increase corruption (single party rule)<p>Stupid democracy, always giving people the representation they want.<p>* [We have also instituted policies to] increase crime (lax prosecution, sanctuary)<p>The data disagrees [7].. SF&#x27;s violent crime rate is better than most large cities (including Ft. Worth, NYC, Louisville, Phoenix, Nashville, Houston, Boston... ), most of the violent crime is constrained to a few neighborhoods and the property crime is generally petty theft.<p>* [We have also instituted policies to] drive out families and middle class (high costs, poor schools)<p>The high costs are due to the strong job market combined with a housing shortage. The housing shortage was exacerbated by the credit freeze in the wake of the GFC. There was a 5 year time period when almost 0 new units were constructed. Between now and 2015, 8,000 new units will be constructed, that&#x27;s more than the previous 15 years combined.[8] Does that sound like a city afraid of growth?<p>The schools get a bad rap, they actually perform fairly well on the state&#x27;s API rankings [9]. There are some obvious problems, especially in the Mission and Bay View areas, but close to 80% of schools in SF are improving YoY.<p>Bemoaning snarky, inaccurate caricatures of laws and policies is about the laziest form of civic engagement possible. You live here, so why not work to make things better.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walkscore.com/cities-and-neighborhoods/</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.sftu.org/rentcontrol.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sftu.org/rentcontrol.html</a>\n[3] - <a href=""http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/223032/tax+authorities/Proposition+E+Death+Of+The+San+Francisco+Business+Payroll+Tax"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/223032/tax+authorities/...</a>\n[4] - <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tax-break-draws-firms-to-Mid-Market-3622860.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tax-break-draws-firms-...</a>\n[5] - <a href=""https://data.sfgov.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://data.sfgov.org/</a>\n[6] - <a href=""https://github.com/SupervisorMarkFarrell/San-Francisco-Open-Data-Legislation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SupervisorMarkFarrell/San-Francisco-Open-...</a>\n[7] - <a href=""http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/murdersanfrancisco19992011.PNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fathersmanifesto.net/murdersanfrancisco19992011.P...</a>\n[8] - <a href=""http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/05/17/san-francisco-rental-construction-soars.html?page=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/0...</a>",1379550897

I mean, there wasn&#x27;t much in the way of raising stray animals or amateur carpentry, but the rest of that stuff we did.  Lots of unsupervised mayhem running around the area.<p>I watched too much TV, and the mayhem was mostly confined to our local neighborhood and the ravine nearby, but we still played.<p>The thing is about my area is that it was built in the &#x27;30s.  Before two-car homes.   This city is so dense that a kid can walk anywhere, even though it&#x27;s a pretty big city.<p>But now, living in the same neighborhood with my own kids, the culture has changed.  I&#x27;d never dream of sending my 6-year-old son out to walk to school on his own and there isn&#x27;t a mob of similar kids hiking to school for him to go with, and his friends aren&#x27;t really playing out front on the street - it&#x27;s all scheduled playdates.<p>Part of the problem is dual-income homes.  It&#x27;s only three blocks to school, but I drive my kids there anyways because I&#x27;m on my way to work... my wife is already at her job by then.<p>And this is the best-case scenario for Canada - a dense, pedestrian-friendly, close-to-school, close-to-the park house where kids can walk to anything.  It&#x27;s an affluent area with no crime to speak of other than drunken students.  It is quite possibly the ideal place for kids to roam free... and they still don&#x27;t do it.<p>And compare that to the rest of Southern Ontario that is one vast ocean of suburban tract housing where there is <i>nothing</i> in walking distance and all the houses and shops are in an ocean of parking and wide streets that makes even your neighbor feel a little further.",1379550866

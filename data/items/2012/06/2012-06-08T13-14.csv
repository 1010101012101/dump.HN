Why are we working on type systems and modules and concurrency primitives et. al. without a scrap of evidence that any of it contributes to programmer productivity? There's no science there.<p>In fact, everyone here should flip this around and ask: can you design a practical experiment to compare productivity of dynamic vs. static languages?

4084153,comment,4083998,4083998,5,0,Lockyy,,,"I experienced the strict setting of sitting in a classroom, facing forwards, listening to the teacher give demonstrations and then answering tens of questions that followed the same pattern. This was from 16-18 and was only a small change from what I had experienced previously.
Before that we had at least been allowed to talk to each other, I think because the teacher recognised how needed that is.<p>Once I was studying for my A-levels however I was in a group of people who wanted to learn maths, we had chosen the subject after all. But we were given a teacher who demanded that we were silent, demanded that when we had a problem we asked her and not each other. Except for some students she came to the conclusion that their not understanding was their fault and would just tell them that they should have listened originally, for others it would just take too long to get an answer because the class was overcrowded with students. Twenty-five students at that level is far too many for one teacher.<p>Some students fell behind, and when they decided that instead of doing the parts of the subject they had no chance of understanding they would work on things they did understand to get up to speed, they had less advanced mock papers taken from them and told to do what they were told to do.<p>Students dropped maths, very able students dropped the subject. A lot of people's marks were hurt drastically due to just coming to hate the subject. We knew that discussing things with each other would help us a lot, it was good that I could turn to someone and ask them to explain something right then without having to wait for the single teacher to deal with the five other people who needed help before me. Hence, we did it anyway because it worked and we weren't stupid enough to keep silent just because the teacher told us to, we had to do this to learn, and we had voluntarily chosen the subject to learn.<p>So yes, I completely agree with the argument that the traditional approach is broken and that nobody wins. It's the only thing at that school that I have bad memories of, every other department, even other teachers within the maths department, knew the value of group based learning.
A bad teacher using a bad method can ruin peoples view of an entire subject extremely quickly which can lead to disastrous results.",1339163706

4084138,comment,4081000,4081942,1,0,hoodwink,,,"tl;dr: acquire data through crowdsourcing, it will create an awesome edge above and beyond making data acquisition easy<p>The data acquisition could be organic and crowdsourced.  For instance, it is possible that some people take pride in their home cities and then would take the time create a ""tour"" in order to share their unique perspective with outsiders.  The motivation for a person to take the time to do this might be as simple as wanting to present's one proud city in the best light.  A karma feature would be solid as well.  There would still be the ""chicken and egg"" problem to get content and users, but maybe there is a creative solution for that.<p>This happens on an ad hoc basis all the time.  Take me for an example.  I'm a long-time Philadelphia resident.  When friends or family (or friends thereof) visit the City of Brotherly Love, I'll often get an email, FB message, or call asking, ""What should I do when I'm in Philadelphia?""  (Unfortunately, I also get ""Pat's or Geno's all too often, too) I'll then take 20 minutes to type a message with my ""insider"" perspective on how to get the most out of a touristy trip.  I could do a write-up for this particular service on Philly in 2 minutes just by searching my gmail and finding my last recommendation email.<p>The social/crowdsourced data acquisition could have cool implications.
- First, it would be an insider perspective and everyone loves to feel like they experienced the ""real deal"" instead of scratching the surface of various tourist traps.
- Second, rather than having one generic tour for each city, there would be a menu of user-created tours to choose from.  I know if my mother were visiting Antwerp, she would have a much different agenda than I would.  Therefore, the social aspect of this method would enable a user to filter ""tours"" by the demographic profile of the ""tour guide.""  I'll look for 20-something ""tour guides"" who posted activities with an active tilt whereas my mom will look for recommendations on art museums and sites with historic value.<p>Revenue model (long-term) is obvious.  Sell advertising.  Local businesses can target advertising to a desirable audience: one that is captive and more likely to spend money.  Think restaurants, bars, hotels, hostels, rental cars/scooters, entertainment, tourist attractions.  With this app, there will be great info on where the tourist plans to go so the advertising will have exceptional value.  Obviously the service can't cheapen the value of the ""insider info"" by drowning a user in ads, but thoughtfully placed ads would probably be tolerable (and effective).<p>I like this idea.  I would use it all the time, personally.  Let me know if you end up pursuing it and want some help!",1339163451

Most people who know what nails they need don't bother you. But the guy/girl starting on their first renovation or garden are practically begging you to take their money. Personally, when I step foot into a hardware store it's a given that I'm leaving with $100 worth  of stuff.<p>Now a better example would be consumer electronics.

If you store the password in the source code an attacker must then capture both the source code and the hashes. Furthermore, if they leak your key, you learn that they have gained access to your source code.<p>I agree that this is a less than ideal system. My point was not to design a better system, but to point out that composing permutations with a secure hash function is at least as strong as that secure hash function. If you disagree consider the identity permutation. Really you'd want to implement it like SHA256(AES(key,SHA256(password|salt)).<p>If I wanted to design a better system this is what I would do. Put the hashing system on a dedicated box that maps passwords to hashes. To compromise the hash key an attacker must compromise your hashing box and your database.

4084012,comment,4082775,4082775,11,0,kaffeinecoma,,,"I wonder whether they are actually measuring the right thing here. I think the real value to static typing is not so much the initial development of small (tiny, in this case) programs, but rather large systems that have long lifetimes and maintenance periods involving multiple developers.<p>I just started diving into Ruby. I'm about a month into it, after having spent over a decade doing Java and other static languages. The productivity boost for new development in Ruby is very real; I converted a 10K LoC java program to < 1K LoC Ruby in about a week, despite not knowing the language well at all. It almost feels like a ""runner's high"" to be so incredibly productive. But there are several things that I find frustrating about dynamic typing.<p>In dynamic languages it's very hard to navigate existing code and libraries. In Java, you can click on a variable and instantly navigate to its declaration and class definition. In a well-configured environment (say Intellij + Maven) you can even click on imported libraries and drill right down into their source, even the JRE. It's totally natural to know exactly what a method takes as arguments, and what it returns.<p>In Ruby it always feels like a mystery. When you ask the IDE to jump into a library, it pops up a dialog of 20 choices and makes you guess which one to open. It feels like the old days of running find/grep over the source tree. And if you somehow manage to guess correctly and find the code you're looking for, you often have to read the comments (if they exist) to figure out what it expects/returns. I'm sure a lot of this is due to my inexperience, but code navigation is really painful in a dynamic environment. I can only imagine how hard it would be in a non-trivial project after a couple of years with a few different devs.<p>Of course refactoring is way better in a static environment. Even if you throw out the IDE, you can more or less instantly find where a piece of code is used by simply renaming it and recompiling to see what breaks. In Ruby you have to rely on tests for that kind of thing, instead of getting it for free from the compiler.<p>Don't get me wrong- I'm excited about Ruby, and I think dynamic languages will play a major role in the rest of my career. I just wish that code navigation could be better.",1339161736

You need both, similarly as to how both boys need their fathers even though both of them get declared the strongest in the world in turns.<p>With dynamic typing it's much more difficult to create large, reliable codebases. There's too much implicitness among the interactions of different actors, modules, and programmers.<p>With static typing it's much more difficult to create <i>any</i> codebase. The exploratory nature of programming means that you will have to constantly change and redefine the static types, signatures and interfaces.<p>What you want is a language where you can start prototyping dynamically and later on when the APIs stabilize gradually you can then stamp static type checking on top of them for cementation without actually having to rewrite anything, possibly in another language. When you can selectively force a freeze on a certain piece of code or API then you can gradually move from dynamic to ""static enough"" typing as the part of your development process.",1339161549

For instance, claims about quantum computing solving NP complete problems are legitimately held in doubt because of theoretical reasons. Also, whenever there are short term positives hiding a long term negative, like say unsustainable financial or ecological behavior, the negatives might be only seen by a chain of reasoning and not by direct experiments.<p>I agree in the sense that we see so many cases in the other direction - reasoning full of holes being trusted over empirics.

That was seen as evidence that the crisis was spinning out of control.<p>But even in a worst-case financial crisis, there will still be money! Governments might make mistakes that worsen the crisis, but the governments in control of the important currencies like the dollar and the euro are unlikely to make the mistake of hyperinflating the currency, which is the only thing I can think of that would make dollars and euros almost useless. And in the (very unlikely IMHO) event that dollars and euros and pounds sterling do become useless, such a situation would provide a fertile environment for some alternative like e-gold and bit gold to become widely adopted (even if the alternative have no chance of wide adoption in the present environment) because necessity is the mother of invention and of flexible attitudes.<p>But that is a bit of a side issue. The main point I wish to make now is that I never said that a financial crisis could not impose massive disruption and massive human costs in the short term. Instead, I gave an argument for why I thought we are unlikely  to see a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s -- which I will point out lasted about 10 years.  And in particular that no matter how misguided the monetary and fiscal policies of the major governments and no matter how greedy and destructive the decisions of the financial professionals, it will take a lot less than 10 years for most of the loss of human prosperity caused by a financial meltdown to be worked around -- because, like I said, one important difference between 1929 and now is that it would take a lot less than 10 years for the people reading this message board to devise services running on the internet tailored to the needs of the captain of the ship, the owner of the goods on the ship and prospective buyers of those goods that allow complicated continent-spanning positive-sum exchanges of value to take place.",1339161367

Land has sold within the last four years from $6K to $10k per acre.  Therefore, using the low number, one family will need to be able to raise crops on $6,000,000 worth of land by owning or leasing the ground.<p>We haven't gotten to equipment yet.  Center pivots start at $35K, tractors are about $100K, combines are $250K.  We still need heads for the combines for each crop raised, and of course plantering, fertilizing, cultivating, ridging, and discing implements to tend the land.  Figure $25K apiece.  Add 15% if they're the proper shade of green.<p>I could keep going, but you get the point, hopefully, that farming is an extremely expensive enterprise with relatively low margins.<p>""Should"" it be that way?

Assuming 3 watts and $100 per core (which align fairly well to the figures presented in the article), 96 core cluster would draw nearly 300 watts and cost nearly $10000.<p>Contrast that to eg Intel E5-2650L[1]: 8 cores, 16 threads, 70 watts and $1200 price. Obviously the whole system cost would be much higher, but I find it hard to believe that you couldn't get/build two 2-socket systems with such CPU for $10000. The CPUs alone would draw 280 watts, which would put the whole system power consumption in the same ballpark as the ARM cluster.<p>Remaining question would be performance. ARM cluster would have 50% more (logical) cores, but I'd imagine that Intel would have far higher per-thread performance. And for lots of tasks the 100M Ethernet of the Beagleboard as an interconnect could become a bottleneck.<p>[1]<a href=""http://ark.intel.com/products/64585/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2650L-(20M-Cache-1_80-GHz-8_00-GTs-Intel-QPI)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ark.intel.com/products/64585/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-...</a>",1339160597

4083933,comment,4078483,4078483,1,0,windexh8er,,,"This is definitely an interesting thread, but there seems to be too much focus on Runyon as the bad actor in this case.  While I can't say I agree with what Monsanto is doing (the suing and the GM component) I don't think the circumstance is reasonably accounted for...<p>Using Runyon as an example - even if evidence shows that he took advantage of the situation he was inadvertently involved.  The root cause was not of his initiation.  Ultimately, in my eyes, it should be the responsibility of Monsanto and it's customers to enforce containment.  If that's not possible, then they have a flawed product.  Monsanto is well aware of the risk involved in IP within a seed.  It's main objective in it's lifecycle is to self-sustain, so unless they can turn that off without a doubt they have to accept the risk.<p>What I mean:  If Monsanto and it's customers can't contain the product they buy and use then there should be no implications for anyone around them to take on that responsibility.<p>Example (and I know these haven't been going well, so my stab):  BP comes knocking on Runyon's neighbor's door.  They want to drill in his (the neighbor's) fields, but there is high risk that they may contaminate a shared water table Runyon and the neighbor's land is sitting on.  The neighbor decides to go forth - and the inevitable happens.  Now - who's fault is it?  Runyon's - for being where he is and not instigating (at all) the actions that the neighbor chose to execute?  In an argument where the outcome is bad - it's easy to identify the bad actor.  In an argument where the outcome is indirectly good there is no incentive for Runyon to sue his neighbor for giving him something that normally should be paid for.<p>Solution?:  Monsanto must place all risk of seed carryover on to it's <i>customers</i>.  It is not the anonymous farmers responsibility to fight Monsanto when their competition (the neighbor) has instigated the problem.  BUT... Monsanto would never sue their own customers because that is counter-productive; nobody would buy seed from them.<p>I agree with suing Monsanto.  But on the basis that Monsanto and it's customers are operating under a negligent business model which enables them to sue innocent farmers.  It almost seems to me that Monsanto is under the assumption that emminent domain applies to it's intellectual property - of which I do not agree.<p>If the BP spill would have leaked $20 bills instead of oil - you really think there would have been any lawsuits or complaints?<p>Bottom line: if Runyon didn't intentionally set out to steal Monsanto seeds then he has no responsibility to Monsanto.  If you argue that he took advantage of the situation I would argue that is his right and luck.  Now if he turns around and directly competes with Monsanto - there may be a case.  Otherwise in the land of my personal morals I don't believe Runyon can be held accountable.<p>Carpe diem.<p>EDIT: Formatting.  And thought...  If Monsanto has the genetic research capability to create a product that is resistant to something like RoundUp - why can't it modify the lifecycle of the plant to only grow if some simple additive is sprayed on the newly planted field to ""activate"" it?  Something along the lines of a license key for seeds.  That way - if Runyon was caught with plants in an entire field it would showcase theft.  It's easier for Monsanto to sue innocent bystanders than put money into R&D of a protection mechanism I would guess...  And, yes, I've oversimplified genetic engineering, but again - it's a flawed product if you can't protect it.",1339160548

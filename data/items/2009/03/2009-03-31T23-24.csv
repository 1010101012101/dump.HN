I believe that society should help people who fall into the C category, either through welfare programs or nonprofit organizations, but it hurts the rest of society when the people who acted responsibly are required to subsidize those who are in the A or B category. My argument is that it hurts society more to pay for the A and B people than it does to let the A and B people take the consequences of their actions. I argue that the more retirement is subsidized, the more people will rely on the subsidies.

A 15 minute phone call or a well-worded 1 hour rant on the blog?<p>I TOTALLY agree that GS is confusing, especially for novice users.  In fact, I'll go farther and say that the changes they are making aren't enough to fix that.  They need to change the page titles/descriptions so that they are obviously 3rd party in the SERP.<p>In short, I agree with the offense.  I'm not sure about intent/malice.  Because of that, I think the response falls into the self-gratifying torch-and-pitchfork vigilantism that plays so well on the internet.

This blog post doesn't quote anyone, or, from what I can see, do any actual reporting.<p>That's not to say the Chron story is true; it's just pointing out that while we have the Chron's side, we don't yet have Macy's.",1238540408

They used public money to <i>help</i> people without any savings to go in debt, so they can buy houses. Why? Because during the construction bubble, banks invested a lot in buildings that can&#x27;t be sold (world crisis hit). Under disguise of helping young people getting their first property, they helped banks get rid of the dead capital <i>and</i> earn more money on loans. Subsidies went for <i>interests</i> for the first four years of payment.\nWhat about rational hard working people who saved and didn&#x27;t need a loan? They got nothing. \nWhy this wasn&#x27;t in Washington Post?

Perl 6 gets free press, but Perl 5 gets mocked and public opinion turns even further against it.<p>First of all, the press for Perl 6 isn&#x27;t free at all. We get press because we do cool stuff with programming languages. So do the Rust and Nim communities, for example. Please don&#x27;t downplay our effort. And the comments are full of prejudice against Perl 6 that is rooted in its Perl 5 legacy; so it&#x27;s not &quot;free&quot; in a second dimension.<p>Second, in my experience, Perl 6 is only a small part of the ridicule. Mostly it&#x27;s about Perl being aweful to read (for which Perl 6 bears no blame at all), lousy code quality, unfamiliar looks through sigils, and so on.<p>>  You refer to &quot;unsolved problems&quot; and while I&#x27;m sure there are from your perspective, from mine as someone who writes large Perl 5 applications, there are no great issues<p>Have you ever asked yourself if this is actually true? Would your work be much easier if you had sane threading in some scenarios? Subroutine and method signatures? never had to deal with the bloat that comes from different libraries using different object systems?<p>I also happen to work on big Perl 5 code bases for money, and with the knowledge of what&#x27;s possible in a perlish language, I regularly identify pain points that in the end are rooted in missing or deficient language features.",1422830550

We might then have  situations where a highly experienced programmer might sign up with a startup, and sign a contract with that startup, but then have the contract declared null and void if the startup is acquired.<p>I can imagine a &quot;less likely&quot; and &quot;more likely&quot; way this might play out:<p>1.) &quot;less likely&quot; would be something bordering on blatant theft -- perhaps the contract specifies options or bonuses, but the parent company, after the acquisition, no longer wants to pay. That would be fairly blatant, though not impossible.<p>2.) &quot;more likely&quot; would, I think, be issues regarding copyright, which, with software, allows something of a fudge factor, since software is always changing, and no one programmer writes the whole of a large system. I&#x27;m thinking of my own startup here: during the years 2000 to 2002 I created a content management system, which then became the basis of a company that was formed in 2002. But the founding documents of that company gave me the right to specific royalty payments for the CMS, even if we eventually agreed to dissolve the company (which we did in 2008). But suppose the company was acquired, and then the acquiring company declared that the requirement to pay royalties was null and void?

Nuclear power is not competitive with coal, and there&#x27;s still plenty of coal. Solar and large-scale wind generation research is also similarly contrary to market economics, as neither is competitive with the cheapest available fossil fuels.<p>A pure market would likely follow the &quot;olduvai theory&quot; scenario exactly:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_theory</a><p>By the time fossil fuels became too expensive, there would be no capital available to invest in alternatives as fossil depletion would slow growth and cause investment capital to evaporate. Thermodynamically this is a manifestation of the energy trap:<p><a href=""http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/the-energy-trap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/10/the-energy-trap/</a><p>Avoiding these scenarios requires planning rooted in conceptual thought. Markets &quot;think&quot; through price signaling. I see little evidence that markets as a whole can incorporate long-term conceptual thinking into price signals, which means that markets basically can&#x27;t think conceptually. In fact, price signals on the run-up side of a bubble are deceptive. This is why so many people lose money in them.<p>As the first article says -- many of these peak-ist predictions have not materialized. The reason is probably that we don&#x27;t have a pure market, and thus we &quot;irrationally&quot; invested in things like nuclear, wind, solar, efficiency, and even enhanced oil/gas recovery that wasn&#x27;t economic when we funded it. Imagine our energy picture right now with no nuclear, wind, or solar on the table. It remains to be seen whether what we&#x27;ve done is too little too late or not.",1422828159

The only reason for this is so that my bookmarks toolbar doesn't have to have any text just icons for each site. Sorry it's a bit OCD but it'd really make my day. Cheers.",1181847390

It's literally a box that you uncheck, and then you are on google.com search only.<p>Purchasing AdWords and optimizing it is a science in and of itself.  goodkeywords.com provides a useful tool for researching different potential key words.  Then you can use G's sandbox or the Overture key word pricing to project ROI. You want to shoot for at least a 1% conversion rate on the AdWords advertising.<p>I have been out of this area for a couple months, but send me an e-mail if you have other general questions.  Maybe I can help out.",1181846900
28163,comment,28150,28150,0,0,davidw,,,"I recently created DedaSys as an LLC in Oregon for the grand total of $55.  I will probably have to do more research and spend more of my own time to make sure things are done properly, and that I don't miss anything, and I'm sure I'll have an accountant do the taxes.  However, I actually didn't mind the research, being the kind of person who likes to know how things work.  I'll probably spend some of the money saved on books (or, even better, maybe I'll check some books out of the library when I'm home this summer).<p>Remember, you can always transform an LLC into a C corporation at a later date.  To me it made sense to start small, and only spend that money when I'm sure I need it.",1181846751
28162,comment,28150,28159,0,0,lindsayrgwatt,,,"If all you want to do is incorporate and you are going to be the sole shareholder, you can do it via an Internet service.  Lawyers are useful if you need anything more complex than this e.g., agreements for the initial shareholders, stock options agreements, etc.<p>If all you're doing is creating a corporation for legal protection, then do it yourself.<p>One word of advice though, think through how many shares you want to issue.  If you're going to offer stock options, then issue a huge number - like 10 million.  If you don't think you'll need options, then go for just a few.<p>If you pick too few now, you'll need to hire a laywer in the future to help you with a stock split or share issue to increase the number of shares.<p>Also, one other word: if you're just incorporating for yourself and don't plan on getting any venture funding in the foreseeable future, incorporate as an LLC so you can pass the tax losses from your company on to your personal taxes.",1181846591

Run far away from this guy.<p>Now for the rational explanation: What is he offering besides money?  It's nice that he is willing to give you money, but does he have any contacts or experience or skills that might put you in a better position? Doing something just because you are cash strapped is a horrible idea.  <p>There was a good convo here a while back for lawyers with software start up experience:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=16419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=16419</a>

28159,comment,28150,28150,0,0,Peanut,,,"that sounds like an absolutely TERRIBLE idea.<p>dealing with competent lawyers is bad enough, do not subject yourself to what will amount to a miserable experiment in futility just because he's the only lawyer you know.<p>if you need money (first off ask yourself what you actually need money for), get someone with money who will let you do your thing <p>to set up the C-crop, you SHOULD use a lawyer. ask friends or friend's of friends for recommendations. get a lawyer who will charge a flat fee, ours is only charging us $750 to issue the stock/create the bylaws/etc. use a bigname incorporation service to actually incorporate you in delaware if you have not yet done so (we used www.ctadvantage.com, cost us like $900 but only because we were stupid and had started off as an LLC and then decided to switch to C-corp).<p>the mental-illness dude does not sound like he can help you with either money or legal matters and will be more trouble than he's worth. STAY AWAY FROM HIM<p>hope this helps

Having read recently about people buying google ads and having issues with their money ""wasted"" (I'm quoting) on AdSense placement (ads showing up on other people's websites, where people are not clicking on them as much or not at all), I am curious if there have been any attempts to measure the effectiveness of AdSense.<p>Personally, if I ever pay Google, I'd want my ads to show up on google.com only (something they discourage you to do) but I'd be glad to be wrong.",1181845475

28152,comment,28150,28150,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"So, I need to incorporate my startup. After some research I'm pretty sure I want to be a Delaware C Corporation so I can sell later. <p>A friend of mine, a corporate lawyer, is interested in funding my startup and providing the initial legal services, but there are a few big catches: this guy is extremely difficult to deal with (history of mental illness) and doesn't seem to know much about the issues surrounding startups. I had to explain to him why I want to be a C corp, and I'd think he should already understand that. <p>My intuition obviously tells me to avoid this guy if I can help it, but here's the real problem: I'm a complete bootstrap startup and I have to pay the bills in San Francisco. If my friend doesn't incorporate me, I'll have to use one of those incorporation websites - I can't afford to actually pay a lawyer to do it. Am I insane to even consider this option?",1181844859

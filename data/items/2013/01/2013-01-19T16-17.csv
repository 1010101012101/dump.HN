That is, in Haskell, numeric literals are polymorphic on the type they are supposed to be: the type system can infer whether you need an Int, an Integer, a Double, a Word or even a Word18--which my last project did--just from using a literal number. In every other language I know, you would have to specify which one you wanted somehow, either by using a current syntax (like 0L or 0.1) or calling a function on the number. In Haskell, the type system can figure it out for you.",1358614712

Further, that type of hybrid ""cyborg"" situation is decidedly not optimal, it is simply the best way to make use of limited computing ability. Instead of a computer brute forcing every possible situation, the human tells it what ones are bad and to avoid. With infinite computing power, no human intervention would ever be needed, nor would it help. Obviously we dont have that kind of power, but for chess I believe it is already at the point where humans cannot improve upon a bots strategy by advising it. For poker, the issue is that these games have not been studied anywhere near to the level that chess has, so it is very likely that even a top pro would not be able to pick the ""best"" starting points for the program to then solve [or what ones to ignore, except for the very obvious which wouldnt be helpful]. For nearly all 2-player fixed-limit games, a pure computer strategy would win. When you add more players, the hybrid solution is needed, however, it is still not the theoretical best.",1358614065

After my husband steve left me for another woman, he said i was not good enough and that he hates me. I cried because i really love steve with all my heart. Then i decided to come online to look for a spell caster to help me bring back steve, all they kept doing was to collect my money and nothing was being done. Until God directed dr khakani to me. At first when i met dr khakani i was thinking he also want to collect my money for nothing, but he told me to give him a chance that what will he gain if he add pain to my pain. That all he want is my happiness. So i decided to give him a chance, and he told me that steve will be back in my arms within 48hours, and i said okay. Truly when dr khakani casted this spell, my husband steve called me that he wanted to tell me something...i was shocked. He told me that i should forgive him, that he loves me with all his heart and he promise me never to leave me again and to love me forever. Dr khakani also told me that when steve comes back to me, he's going to buy me a gift. Steve bought me a brand new car, and i also have access to his account to prove to me that he will never leave me. That was how dr khakani stopped me from crying and i got over my deppression and predicament. You can contact dr khakani for any kind of help and he will never disappiont you.

Thats a bit more of an apples-to-apples comparison.<p>Serverbear notes that Amazon 7.5GB Large instances (which cost $180+ / month) benchmark at ~650 on Unixbench... with 30 MB/s for its disk. In comparison, a 8GB VM from Digital Ocean only costs $80/month. I don't have the numbers for the 8GB VM, but the smaller $20/month 2GB instance has a UnixBench of ~1900 with over 300MB/s I/O from its solid state drive.<p>(I presume the larger instances have more CPU power / priority in the VM scales)<p>That is half the cost for triple the CPU performance and 10x better disk performance. Other smaller providers, such as RamNode, offer extremely fast I/O with RAID 10 Solid State Drives in their Virtual Private Servers (500+ MB/s).<p>Amazon vs Digital Ocean<p>serverbear.com/239-large-amazon-web-services<p>serverbear.com/1990-2gb-ssd--2-cpu-digitalocean<p>To be fair though, Amazon's CPUs are more consistent... consistently bad, but consistent. VPS CPUs and I/O are affected by their neighboring VMs, while Amazon seems to have removed that uncertainty. Nonetheless, in practice, you will always get a better performing CPU and I/O from other providers.<p>And if we compare both to bare metal servers, obviously bare metal servers win in price/performance, but are harder to maintain, so its hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison. But Digital Ocean VMs can be spun up/down just like Amazon instances... although Amazon has more load balancers and other infrastructure. (But nothing is stopping you from setting HAProxy on a front-end VM to loadbalance a cluster of VMs from Digital Ocean. Even then, other VPS providers like Linode offer Load Balancers as part of their infrastructure now)<p>Its hard for me to see the case for Amazon's cloud offerings. They don't have very much price/performance at all. At all ends of the spectrum, low end to high end, VPS providers such as Digital Ocean offers more vertical scalability as well as a cheaper price on all of Amazon's offerings.<p>Unless you need some specialized VM from Amazon (ie: GPU compute), or are locked into their vendor-specific API (oh I feel sorry for you), there is no reason to use Amazon's services IMO.",1358613272

You're right in that by far the most challenging part of the learning so far was the first day, and trying to get rails working on a Windows PC.

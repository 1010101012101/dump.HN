Ruby and Python have a pretty good track record there.<p>One of the themes of Gary's talk was that Ruby is more expressive/flexible than Python, and lisp was thrown into the discussion as sort of a ""gold standard"" of expressiveness/flexibility, without necessarily passing any judgment on overall merits of the three languages.<p>To the extent that Ruby strives for more flexibility, it is probably way more influenced by Perl than lisp.<p>As somebody who has used both Ruby and Python fairly extensively, I think Ruby is undeniably more expressive than Python at times, but also more arcane at others.  Some of the differences probably come from irreconcilable tradeoffs, where you cannot have your cake and eat it too, but other tradeoffs are probably less necessary, which is why people continue to discuss it.  In the case of Ruby, it's a pretty young language, so there are probably opportunities to make it more appealing to a Python mindset without losing its great flexibility, although I do not have specific proposals.<p>The conference Gary spoke at was a Python conference, so most people were more interested in ways that Python could learn from Ruby, without sacrificing Pythonicness. Gary seemed to reach the conclusion that the number one feature he envied in Ruby was blocks.  Speaking for myself, I wish Python just had some kind of anonymous function syntax that was more rich than lambdas, even if it were not exactly semantically similar to Ruby blocks.",1265212638

Homebrew was designed to be flexible and non-intrusive.<p>However the suggested step is suggested because:<p>1. On OS X /usr/local isn't even there on a fresh install, so nothing that should run as root is there by default.<p>2. Mostly people use Homebrew to install a few tools that are missing, these tools don't need to run <i>as root</i>, so they are as vulnerable as TextMate is (because you dragged it from the DMG to /Applications and it installed as your user).<p>Now you can argue that you should thus install to ~. And you can of course. However I've found over the last eight months that a great deal of build systems have bugs and don't find dependencies if you install the deps outside of /usr or /usr/local. So for a trouble free life we suggest /usr/local.<p>Finally sudo is dangerous. You should only use it with tools you trust.

I would say this is a pretty good starting language since its very easy to transfer to c#, java, php, ect because of the similarities. But it also let the professors explain garbage collection, pointers ect. However c++ had so many annoying moments because the compiler messages were so cryptic which are really bad when starting out.<p>So that makes me believe that c# would be a better choice because of what visual studio can offer. It would allow the students to run through their programs 1 line at a time, see exactly whats going on as well as give much better error messages.",1265211302

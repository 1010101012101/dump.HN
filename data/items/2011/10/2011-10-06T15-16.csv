I was walking a few feet behind, enough to hear the reporter asking about Steves family. As we approached the entrance, Steve stopped and opened the door for an employee carrying trays of food outside. The employee never looked up but said ""Thanks."" ""Sure,"" Steve replied. Just then, at least two dozen people followed the employee out. Because of where the reporter was standing, none of the employees (as far as I could tell) noticed who was holding the door for them. Steve continued holding that door, talking to the reporter, until I came up and offered to take his place as doorman. ""Thanks,"" he said. ""Sure,"" I replied. He smiled and invited the reporter inside.<p>Thats it.<p>Whatever else you may read about Steve, whatever else happens in his life or to Apple or to the world of computing, know that he opened doors for people.<p>R.I.P.

Yet the applications are performing increasingly worse, they keep crashing and not doing what you need them to do.<p>You try to do something about it, but the customer service channels are horrible and even when you manage to log a bug, a complaint or any other feedback, the best you can hope for is that it's ignored; the worst you can hope for it that a patch comes out that doesn't really fix your problems and creates several new ones.<p>At this point, you start complaining loudly and publicly about it. What's the most infuriating reaction you can imagine? I don't know about you, but I've got one that's pretty close to the top of my list is ""Well, how would <i>you</i> solve the problem, then?""

And I don't mean just spam.  I mean whatever unsolicited shit you sent me because you're abusing the address I gave you.  The signal:noise ratio is almost perfect on a social network.  My email box is a daily exercise in frustration.  There is also the desired automated emails, trudging though them is an issue, less of one, but they can be noise depending on what you're using your email for.<p>Directory services.  If I want to contact someone at work, I alt-tab, ctrl-n type FLastname ctrl-k.  Its a ridiculously lightweight action.  At home, if I don't know someones email address looking it up involves stopping at a couple social networks, logging into Outlook Web Access if we happen to have some other organization in common, but thats probably not the address I actually want to send to. And after all that I can still turn up empty handed.  The best case scenario is that they have their email address viewable in facebook, I bring them up on my droid (where facebook populates my contact list), start a draft email from the droid that I can then open up on my computer.  Thats a pretty shitty best case.<p>Going forward, the best way for email to adapt (and a thing I've wanted to see for quite a while) is for a social network to embrace their person organization and relationship management and become a directory service.  Essentially, when I type ""Alice"" into the TO box in gmail, thunderbird, outlook, cellphone sms, my aim client, anything, why isn't her address automatically populated if I know her on service X?  Right now social networks want to create yet another communication channel rather than just giving us a way to manage the ones we have.  Think of a social network that was designed to just to trade contact information, let say vCards.  I friend Alice and Bob on vCardBook, and suddenly I have a vCardBook LDAP server I can throw at my email client to have Alice and Bob's addresses at the ready.",1317914783

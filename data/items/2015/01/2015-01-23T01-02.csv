Companies routinely do reverse share splits pre-IPO to make the total number of shares what they need to be for the valuation divided by shares to equal $12-18.  That point seems to be just a magical desired range for SaaS IPO&#x27;s.  Someone smarter than I may know the reason, but I think they could have hit nearly any share price they wanted to.",1421978256

Apple has their secure enclave (which doesn&#x27;t quite act like a TPM, even though it theoretically could), and there exist vendors who could theoretically include a TEE in their phones (right now they&#x27;re almost entirely limited to special &quot;government-specific&quot; use cases).<p>And I&#x27;m ignoring Samsung&#x27;s solution (which is basically snake oil).<p>Intel&#x27;s SGX would be great, provided that the industry suddenly switches to X86 for mobile (which I don&#x27;t think is going to happen).<p>The mobile industry is way too fragmented from a hardware perspective for any type of trusted computing platform to achieve even a modicum of install base.

What suprised me the most was the fact that Google is serving 40K (now 47K in live statistic) requests per second.
That was way below what I thought.
Each Apache server without real optimization running on a typical physical machine would be able to serve 40-50 requests/second; so they only need a thousand of servers to do 50K requests/second.

Version: 1.8-1
Maintainer: Lars Wirzenius <liw@liw.fi>
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.6), python (>= 2.7), python (<< 2.8), python-larch (>= 1.20131130~), python-ttystatus (>= 0.23~), python-paramiko, python-tracing (>= 0.8~), python-cliapp (>= 1.20130808~), python-fuse
Description-en: online and disk-based backup application
 Obnam makes backups. Backups can be stored on local hard disks, or online
 via the SSH SFTP protocol. The backup server, if used, does not require any
 special software, on top of SSH.
 .
  * Snapshot backups. Every generation looks like a complete snapshot, so you
    don&#x27;t need to care about full versus incremental backups, or rotate real
    or virtual tapes.
  * Data de-duplication, across files, and backup generations. If the backup
    repository already contains a particular chunk of data, it will be re-used,
    even if it was in another file in an older backup generation. This way, you
    don&#x27;t need to worry about moving around large files, or modifying them.
  * Encrypted backups, using GnuPG.
  * Push or pull operation, depending on what you need. You can run Obnam on
    the client, and push backups to the server, or on the server, and pull
    from the client over SFTP.<p>Homepage: <a href=""http://liw.fi/obnam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liw.fi/obnam/</a>",1421977990

There have been heavy debates on how to hide it, but for the interim it’s here to stay.&quot; Really? You get the same thing by right-clicking (or long press on a touchscreen, I imagine) on the desktop. Having an omnipresent widget is redundant and annoys people who don&#x27;t need it.<p>Except many inexperienced users (and some experienced yet lazy users who never take the time to learn their computer, I&#x27;ve noticed) don&#x27;t know or often forget about right-clicking. So when you throw a bunch of random people who have never seen KDE before and test their proficiency with the desktop, of course they&#x27;re going to overlook right-click menu and whine about needing a special widget for customization. But that&#x27;s how UI design is these days: conceding to the lowest common denominator. Designers are striving for a utopian interface that can be used without any training or adjustment period. Yet it&#x27;s a myth. It&#x27;s impossible to make a computer that can be used without instruction. Maybe if half as much time was spent writing documentation as is spent twiddling with icon colors users would have a resource where they could learn how to use KDE.

Whereas for UNIX-compliant OSes the desktop and mouse are not required for anything, a skilled user can easily be more productive using only a keyboard, and anything a user can do can just as easily be placed in a script and automated.<p>Package management is also a major deficiency of Windows. Chocolatey is a nice workaround, but is a relatively young project. Windows did not have any package management for a long time.<p>Also for a lot of programming language packages with native code extensions, it can be difficult or even impossible to get them to compile on Windows.

8932843,comment,8932095,8932752,0,0,mikeash,,,"First of all, you can&#x27;t just mention a bunch of ways in which smaller aircraft are unsafe and then declare that they somehow don&#x27;t count. If pilot experience and currency is a big factor for why small planes are more dangerous (and it most certainly is), then it&#x27;s just a factor for why small planes are more dangerous, not some way that small planes aren&#x27;t more dangerous.<p>For this specific service, there are a couple of things that do make it inherently less safe than being in a brand new 747-800. Specifically, there&#x27;s much less redundancy and fewer emergency options for when something goes wrong. If you lose an engine on a 747 then you just keep going. If you lose an engine, or rather <i>the</i> engine, on a Manhattan-JFK helicopter flight then you&#x27;re going down extremely fast and you have few or no good options for where to put the thing. It&#x27;s similar for suddenly encountering a flock of geese (the odds of a safe landing in the river with a 100% survival rate are considerably lower with a helicopter than with an A320), fuel exhaustion, or a sudden pilot heart attack (I&#x27;m guessing there aren&#x27;t two pilots in these things).<p>Mid-air collisions are another potential danger. I&#x27;m guessing that a helicopter like this doesn&#x27;t have a TCAS system, and not all of the airspace in question requires ATC clearance. Nine people died in a helicopter/airplane collision in NYC in 2009, and it could happen again.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to paint an excessively bleak picture here. I&#x27;d have no qualms about taking a flight on one of these helicopters, aside from the price. But at the same time we shouldn&#x27;t kid ourselves by thinking that it&#x27;s safer than taking a car, let alone as safe as an airliner.",1421975128

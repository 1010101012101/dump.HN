3014992,comment,3012214,3012807,1,0,mcao,,,"Netflix customer here.<p>It's a terrible move because how I go about finding a movie to watch is very important to me. I want to be able to search for movies, browse a genre, or rate movies and get recommendations all through one easy to use interface. I will decide whether I want to stream the movie or wait for it in the mail. How you handle it internally I don't really care. I'm even willing to pay for the services separately.<p>Now, let's compare to cable. If I sign up for Comcast cable with HBO, I would also pay for the services separately. But, I don't want to have two boxes with two remotes sitting next to my TV just so I can watch HBO separately.<p>When I log into amazon.com I can buy physical items like DVDs, or purchase digital items like eBooks or MP3s, or I can stream movies. Maybe they're handled internally by different departments. I don't know and I don't care. All I know is that I can do everything from one interface with one account. I don't need to go to amazulu.com to watch movies and kindlebooks.com to buy books.<p>Simply put, convenience is a HUGE value. Something that I am willing to pay for. I didn't even sweat the Netflix price hike because the value was still there for me. But if you're going to make it HARDER for me to find and watch a movie, I don't see how that's worth paying for.",1316462360

3014978,comment,3014898,3014898,1,0,digikata,,,"The article talks about Win 8 as if you'll be compiling straight to ARM. I haven't been following the Win8/Metro info very closely, but wouldn't one be essentially targeting a .Net/Metro VM with implementations on ARM for mobile devices and x86 for desktops? So of course you're not going to back translate native x86 apps to ARM. Even if the instruction set/API translation were perfect, the computing power wouldn't map over very well.<p>I've been wondering if Google would make a similar strategic move - i.e. provide a desktop environment that can run Android apps targeted to users on multiple OS's (A polish step beyond simulators/emulators for devs...). That way you can access a much larger installed base of users and make the mobile app themselves more portable.<p>Of course there's the argument that mobile-to-desktop protability would result and all that much usability. However, it's something that I suspect that Apple would have a harder time offering because they don't have a VM strongly involved.",1316462103

You could allow either, if the programmer supplies a proof that things are OK. But with such a proof in hand, writing the thong so that it can be mechanically checked is ""just work"" (tedious work, possibly, but for this application, that is not that important). Because of that, why risk that such a proof is flawed (or becomes flawed after a bug fix), if one can just as well prevent the problem?<p>Of course, the checking code will be buggy, too. That is OK; it will be written by a separate team, and will improve over time, just as the code it checks does.<p>I guess that, even with these checks, the program will still have some watchdog timer, a way to remotely reset it, and a way to upload new software, just in case it runs wild.",1316461590

Thats impossible.<p>Other stuff might, but it has little to do with trying to bring tablet concepts to the desktop. Apple clearly hasnt attempted to do that, at least not 1:1.<p>Sure, Apple added fullscreen apps but those have been a staple of Windows forever, I dont think dragging tablets into this makes any sense whatsoever. And you might not like the new simplified Spaces and Expos but they do not have any tablet equivalents. They are all desktop, all the time.<p>Auto saving, resume and Versions are obvious features for any operating system, the tablet/desktop distinction doesnt make any sense when looking at those features. Operating systems should support them, no matter the device. Thats it.<p>So whats the problem? People have been complaining about bugs and some dont like Mission Control or the way fullscreen apps are implemented. I see little relation of those complaints to Apple trying to bring iOS to OS X.

She has great Unix skills on top of her Oracle knowledge.<p>I know plenty of women like that in tech. Intelligent, highly skilled, motivated. In fact, almost all of the women I've worked with in software development fit that description.<p>On the other hand, the majority of men I've worked with in software development are just putting in time. They're working 15/30, collecting their pay, running their fantasy football league from their desk. They don't really understand what they do, but there's always someone willing to carry them.<p>Why the imbalance? The women who aren't interested in tech move on to something else, leaving behind the good ones. The men who aren't interested in tech linger on, becoming a burden (Wally!).<p>I wish the uninterested, uninspired men would move on as well.

See how many will turn into ""look, it's made by a woman and she's pretty too"" threads, forgetting the project itself completely.

The real question is - are they not interested because society makes them think they shouldn't be or because women are naturally different from men in a way that makes them not interested.

3014836,comment,3014013,3014152,18,0,tzs,,,"I'm not a lawyer, though I once was studying to be one. In '92 I took a break from programming and went to law school (University of Washington) with the intent of becoming an IP, corporate, tax, and civil rights lawyer.<p>This was motivated both by curiosity about the law, and I was getting burned out on programming. We were basically a small contract programming shop, specializing in taking on firmware projects that were late, over budget, and failing and turning them around on a fixed bid and tight schedule. It was rather intense, and after four years of it, I needed a break.<p>Law school was a perfect extended vacation. While I was in law school, my former company had switched from the business of fixing people's messes to developing its own products and selling them, and I had done some programming on that part time and over the summers as I got over my programming burnout.<p>By the time I was finishing up law school, and only had left writing a paper for the intellectual property seminar I had taken, I hit a case of writer's block. I could just not get going on the topic I had chosen (intellectual property issues of usenet).<p>By that time the plan was to get the law degree, pass the bar, and go back to my old company as primarily the chief programmer and secondarily as in-house counsel on corporate and IP matters. I went back to work full time that summer and intended to write the paper when the writer's block passed and inspiration struck, however long that took. I never did get around to that, and that's where the matter stands today, 16 years later.<p>So, combine that with (1) a decent math and science background (BS Mathematics, Caltech, class of '82), (2) an above average ability to recall obscure but relevant snippets from magazines, books, blogs, and whatever other random sources I've read or seen, and (3) sufficient lack of a social life that I have time to Google obsessively before making statements of fact that I'm not sure of, and I can end up sounding like I actually know what I'm talking about!",1316459329

He formulates it as an <i>at-all-costs</i> mantra -- stay in programming, for the worst could happen. It can be absolutely horrid advice to a number of people who would excel even more at other IT roles or management roles (see interesting comment from robertk [1]). I myself was long not considering applying to non-development roles, because many of those great opportunities are more and more looked down upon as ""not programming"". I know some people who've come as far as ""Be Mark Zuckerberg or die trying"", completely rejecting any business model that isn't two guys coding in a garage. I didn't actually read PG's comment like that -- I have the utmost respect for PG; but this is the background for why I authored such an opposing comment. I don't actually think the RAQs we are discussing were designed to be put under lawyer-like scrutiny ;)<p><i>Depends on what your goal is</i><p>Completely agree. Casual focus will rarely lead to greatness.<p><i>they should get out of the way and enable programmers to work optimally</i><p>For someone to get out of the way, he first has to be in the way. You make the general assumption that a manager is bad unless he actively changes his style. I cannot challenge this assumption for I have no data or ideas on where to find some concerning if managers are universally good or bad. And even then employee satisfaction might not be the only metric to measure success. Although I do think that having fun at work is one of the most, if not the most important metric. Many things would be better if everyone enjoyed their work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3012765"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3012765</a>",1316459138

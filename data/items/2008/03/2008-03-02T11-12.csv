People could have voted both for Nader and Gore, which would have tipped Gore over the edge.<p>How about 1992? Could Bush have won if angry republicans would have a chance to vent their anger by also voting for Perot? Or might Perot have won since voting for a 3rd party candidate wouldn't feel like a lost vote.<p>To demonstrate the problem with approval voting (all voting systems have problems, as was proven by Kenneth Arrow in 1951): if Obama, Clinton and McCain would all run, McCain would probably win, even if a majority of voters preferred either Democrat.<p>So, approval voting <i>should</i> allow fair elections with more than two candidates, but in practice it doesn't, because people vote strategically.",1204459143

127301,comment,126608,126608,0,0,gahahaha,,,"I think the comments so far in this discussion are misguided in attributing the good school performance of Finnish pupils to some character trait of Finns. That's like saying blacks in America do worse in school because of black culture.<p>Finland has a great educational system. It's that simple. And that hard too. It takes decades to create a good educational system, and you can't do it with handing out more money or new laws.",1204457479

The way, IMO, to successfully use CL is to use an RSS reader that allows you to define ""watches""/""alerts"" (like FeedDemon). Create watches for the popular terms you are looking for and then subscribe to CL's resumes board's RSS feed. The more specific you are about the terms you want, the less clutter you'll go through. Putting a watch on ""Windows XP"" will get you nowhere; putting a watch on ""Windows 2008"" will find you an early adopter, for example.",1204455795

I haven't looked into why, but I have some ideas.<p><i>You are being incredibly vague and unhelpful.</i><p>If you don't understand what I'm talking about, it doesn't make /me/ wrong.  And just saying so is also not an appropriate response.  I had a specific question that was answered by the OP, and was useful to me.<p>Hacker News comment threads are rarely a place of education, but I will reinterpret what you said as a question.<p>An IO strategy is how and when you make those system calls.  Reading from disk takes a vast amount of time, during which you can be doing computation.  To be fast, you should be asking for the appropriate amount of lookahead, at the correct offset.  Is that 4k? 1Meg? 100Megs? 1GB? Do you use threads for this?  Can you skip any of the input stream?  Do you let the operating system, programming language, library, or program code decide how big the read is?  Where that data is stored after being read from disk is also important.  Especially fast strategies use mmap to avoid copying from kernel space into user space.  And of course everything is always chunked at specific intervals, so knowing where those are can sometimes reduce the number of calls.  The ability to optimize for these is one thing that makes dedicated database software so successful.<p>It is a dark art, and it is not expected that the average person know these things.  If you happen to be the kind of person working on a programming language, it could be useful to be aware of them.

2143816,comment,2143310,2143310,0,0,giberson,,,"Interestingly, the factorial function is typically used as a trivial example case for introductions to learning a language. Used for the purpose of learning function calls and recursion and as such we tend to think of it in the simplest context.<p>From that context, the factory function makes this article a great example of over designing. And certainly in some senses the point of the article is quite accurate.<p>However, there exists another less common context for the factorial function--serious usage of the function. Not as an introductory example to the language, but as the basis of actual software that has purpose. In this context questions like memory usage, processing power, and even mathematical precision come in to play. Is BigInt large enough for the required use? Maybe you need to use a class based number type capable of having a limitless value. Perhaps you are targeting a distributed processing system, or a single super computer. Will your computing have memory limitations, processing limitations? Suddenly, when considering real applications for the factorial function, all those satirical over-design considerations are now principal necessities that you'd curse the programmer for not having implemented.<p>Ultimately, the key is scope. It's necessary to know the intended scope of the functionality you are coding. You need to consider who (will use code), how (the code will be used) and where (the code will be used [platform]). In Java, the big GET is the DRY philosophy. An immense library of code is available for your reuse. And it's certainly true when perusing the code base of those libraries you'll see a lot of what might seem like over-designing. However, when you consider the intended scope, it's rarely actually over-designed.

""This complex, Depression-era legislation was enacted to protect small businesses by outlawing discriminatory price and promotional allowances obtained by large businesses. As is the case with the other antitrust laws, the Department of Justice, the FTC, and private parties may each bring Robinson-Patman cases, although the enforcement agencies have not focused on this area for some time. Indeed, the Justice Department has criminal powers in this area that have gone unused for many years, while the FTC today brings few significant cases in this area after being particularly active through the 1970s. Private suits on behalf of businesses (consumers have no standing to sue under the statute) account for most of the enforcement activity. Successful plaintiffs are entitled to the same remedies as those available under the antitrust laws (e.g injunctions, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs).""<p>The article lists the very specific reasons a case may be brought, and the various defenses. I do not see how any of this is relevant to your argument that ""charging different prices is illegal"". I do however agree with your concept that you should try out different prices strategies.<p>I have been amazed in my own experience when I make a package of my products priced beyond any shade of reason (from my view, as seller) and someone goes ahead and buys it. I had a manufacturing company and the 'big' package was to buy $1200 worth of goods and it was sometimes a tough sale. We tried a new 'big' package that was priced a little over $10,000 and it was an easier sale (to bigger customers). Lesson learned - don't ever think you know what the limits are until you test them. You might think that nobody would ever pay $100 per month for your widget, when some division of a Fortune 500 company would happily pay you a $1000 per month.

In the bottle it would be closer to $1. At a local bar that has good beer prices and good food it is $3.00 for draft normally, except on Thursdays it is $2 (Bisonwitches, Tucson AZ). If I go to a fancy restaurant it will likely be $4 or even as high as $6.<p>In a free market you are free to charge what you want. Consumers are free not to purchase your item.

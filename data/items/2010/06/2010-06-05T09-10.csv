Typically syphilis and tuberculosis are tested for, plus any additional infectious diseases depending on where you are from.<p>Perhaps the test was to make sure you already have it, so you would better fit in with us raw-meat-eating Belgians :)",1275731692

</code></pre>
This kind of reporting does not take place because the reporter is malicious. It takes place because the reporter thinks his public will consider it interesting and because he thinks his public should be informed about it. Which can be considered stupid, because it is really not that interesting, because it may have adverse effects by strenghtening or causing prejudices through overly broad generalizations and because it may simply be spreading falsehoods.<p>(In which I do not intend to take a stance on the veracity of the claim.)",1275731645
1406697,comment,1405792,1406163,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I disagree; I think it's a pretty important line. The aim was less about it being a sob story and more about introducing the idea, without accusation, that he is being slow and unreasonable.<p>You do have something of a point; but I don't think it will open the way for him to control negotiations. It was deliberately worded to be neutral with no suggestion that the writer is desperate for money.<p>On the other hand; if the gp is concerned then anything will do. Perhaps ""I like to ensure a steady inflow of money  whilst contracting and, as you can imagine, a missed payment can affect my bookkeeping""<p>(that wasn't a very good example - it's early - but yu get the idea).<p>Finally; if it does amount to leverage it is only a little. On he other hand the gp has the big gun of the 30 day limit to hand - that is definitely something not to mention till on the phone :-)",1275731633
1406696,comment,1405698,1406633,0,0,derefr,,,"Your point certainly sounds reasonable, but it's not how the human mind works. The point of conspicuous consumption is to <i>make believe</i> that the man is ""in a position to throw away money like this"", because that (imaginary) man is considered to be a good provider/sexually attractive. Talking about it beforehand would be like telling your kids you were going to dress up as Santa Claus to put presents under the tree—the reality is no different, but the <i>fantasy</i> is ruined.<p>And DeBeers certainly didn't <i>create</i> the notion of conspicuous consumption as a romantic gesture—women have been receiving silver and gold trinkets for millennia, especially ones adorned with various gemstones. DeBeers just popularized diamonds as the gem to be specifically associated with such gestures—and they're a fairly effective/obvious one, too, since they're eye-catching, distinctive, and easy to adorn oneself with.",1275731514

Then they chickened out and pulled the eject handle on the ERM, and cut the base rate back to where it had been before Soros' assault.<p>That was the moment when it became obvious that the next government would be a Labour one.

You lose all the functionality of the awesome Internet we have in 2010 by sending someone a static map.  Anyone who can receive that would be in front of a computer connected to the internet, or if they are on the go, would be on a smart phone with internet access so they could look it up themselves. Might as well just carry around a paper map.<p>Unless you want to be a doormat like that guy in the commercials whose friends call him to ask him for driving directions and movie show times because your phone lets you browse the web while you're in a call at the same time.

Not just the ring (btw, diamond rings for engagement is an American cultural thing as far as I know, in Europe the props are different), but the whole dress code and the mandatory steps involved in the event. Wasn't the future supposed to free us from such conventions?

When I hear a problem, I instinctively offer a solution, or at least try to work through the problems to a solution. Apparently, it's a male trait - ""Ug! Man solve problem.""<p>Then I was offered advice along the lines of ""Don't offer advice until you're asked for it."" Oh, meta. When someone's telling you of his problem: he's not necessarily asking for a solution, he's not necessarily looking for tips, he maybe doesn't even want to change... he just wants to rant and whinge a bit - and if you offer a solution, it's usually unwelcome and you're frustrating his venting.
Of course, if he's ranting, whinging and venting the SAME problem after a few years... well!<p>Thanks for posting this - I'd recently forgotten that line of advice and had reverted to being Mr Instant Problem Solver!<p>Maybe this openness is a trait of HN readers - knowledge accumulators, problem solvers, generous time givers, open-sourcers - that doesn't apply to the wider population!",1275729702

Then I started thinking about it in terms of my own &quot;autonomy&quot;, for lack of a better word -- what gives them the right to &quot;force&quot; my browser to make extra requests to download and display ads, to use my home network for that, to use my bandwidth and data cap for it, to use my CPU, to use my eyes and brain to look and understand the ad.  They have no technical ability to enforce some of that, and any agreement that viewing ads is &quot;payment&quot; is implicit and thus the moral argument is weak.  They don&#x27;t even implement some technical measures they could do, such as YouTube bundling video ads directly into the stream so it would be harder to detect and block, so maybe they don&#x27;t really care enough either.<p>At some point it starts sounding too much like &quot;it&#x27;s stealing to watch broadcast TV if you mute your TV and look away from the screen during ads&quot;, and hopefully most people would say that position is insane.  (And yes, I do recognize that automatic blocking is a bit different, but at the same time, sending instructions that your computer download and display something to you is different than changing the radio waves from a representation of a show to a representation of an ad.)<p>It only works because the majority of TV watchers and internet users are too lazy or unskilled to block ads.  When the majority are blocking ads, the model will either change, or blocking be explicitly criminalized (a session of Congress I&#x27;d pay to watch.)",1442444316

In practice, what you cite as problems aren&#x27;t.<p>1: In <i>either</i> approach, somewhere in your event loop you&#x27;re setting yourself a timeout to fire. Haskell & Erlang do use exceptions, but Go does not, it simply makes this a first-class concern of the core event loop. This is only a problem in languages where the threading was bolted on after-the-fact. Which is a lot of languages, which matter because they have a lot of code. I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss those real problems. But it&#x27;s not a fundamental problem, only accidental.<p>2. In practice, this is not a problem I ever worry about. You get a DB library, it provides pools, unless you&#x27;re talking to a <i>very, very</i> fast DB (like, memcached on localhost fast) this is one of those cases where IO really does dominate any minor price of thread scheduling.<p>3. This has been solved for a long time. Go has the nicest little catch phrase with &quot;share memory by communicating instead of communicating by sharing memory&quot;, but each of Haskell, Erlang, and Go have their own quite distinct solutions to their problems, and in practice, all of them work. There&#x27;s other solutions I merely haven&#x27;t used, but I hear Clojure works, too. (Perhaps arguably a subset of the several approaches Haskell can use. Haskell kind of supports darned near everything, and you can use it all at once.)<p>This is part of why I write this sort of thing... at its usual glacial pace (despite how much we like to flatter ourselves that we move quickly), the programming community is finally getting around to being really seriously pissed off about how bad threading was in the 1990s. Good. We should be. It sucked. Let us never forget that. But what has not been so well noticed is that the problems with threading have basically been fixed, and in production for a long time now (i.e., not just in theory, but shipping systems; go ask Erlang how long it&#x27;s been around). You just have to go use the solutions. Don&#x27;t mistake debates about the minutia of 1:1 OS threading vs. M:N threading and which is single-digit percent points faster than the other for thinking that threading doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Lest I sound too pollyannaish about what is still a hard domain, the way I like to put this is that threading has moved from an exponentially complex problem to a polynomially complex problem. (And Rust is leading the way on making even the polynomial have a small number in the exponent.) There&#x27;s still a certain amount of complexity in making a threaded program go zoom, and it <i>does</i> require some adjustments to how you program, it&#x27;s not &quot;free&quot;, but rather than requiring wizards, it merely requires competent programmers who take a bit of care and use good tools and best practices now.",1442441270

You talk about how to combine multiple Futures into a Future of a tuple and give two example on how to do this.  One that will <i>not</i> execute the futures in parallel:<p><pre><code>  // Returns Future[(User, Seq[Message], Seq[JobOffer])]
  // ** NOT EXECUTED IN PARALLEL **
  val result = for ( 
    user     <- userByEmail(&quot;stephan@ubercto.de&quot;);  // User
    messages <- newMessages;  // Seq[Messages]                         
    offers   <- newOffers   // Seq[JobOffer]                             
  ) yield {
    // do something here
    (user, messages, offers)
  }
</code></pre>
and another that will:<p><pre><code>  // Futures are created here
  val userF = userByEmail(&quot;stephan@ubercto.de&quot;); 
  val messagesF = newMessages
  val offersF = newOffers

  // Returns Future[(User, Seq[Message], Seq[JobOffer])]
  // ** Executed in parallel **
  for (
       user     <- userF;
       messages <- messagesF;
       offers   <- offersF
       ) yield {
         (user, messages, offers)
  }
</code></pre>
and I&#x27;m having a hard time seeing the essential difference between these two bits of code.  How is it that creating the futures before the &#x27;for&#x27; expression results in the Future of the tuple being executed in parallel?  I&#x27;m thinking that the &#x27;for&#x27; expression gets expanded to basically the same flatMap/map expression in both cases.  And that each &#x27;step&#x27; in this flatMap/map expression can only be evaluated after the previous &#x27;step&#x27; has finished, so neither of these approaches will run in parallel.",1442441021

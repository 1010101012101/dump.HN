You&#x27;ll spend your morning figuring out how to download everything and set up a development environment, and your afternoon seeing how plugins and themes work. 24 hours invested in yourself and now you will know what the client is asking for when they ask about WordPress work. Your freelancing career will &quot;happily decline&quot; if you don&#x27;t make self-education one of your priorities between jobs.

Now that the content varies, normal usage will get a 200 and the full response every time.<p>It depends on the Application, but in most cases this will be a reasonable increase in overall bandwidth (for normal use, not the attack). Probably more of an increase than you&#x27;d encounter by turning off gzip - which completely defeats the attack rather than just making it more difficult, as Length Hiding does.<p>The workaround is to use ETags (See: <a href=""http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/ConditionalGet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Conditio...</a>), which will use the tag rather than the content to determine 304s. I&#x27;d suggest this should be recommended if you&#x27;re using Length Hiding.<p>Edit: Actually another workaround might be to put your Middleware <i>after</i> the relevant middleware Rack::ConditionalGet, Rack::ETag. Right now it&#x27;s at the top of the Middleware chain.",1375498264

In fact the only people &quot;harmed&quot; by this are the very people who get nothing. Mind you this is the same DOJ that sees nothing wrong with the NSA, FBI and their ilk recording our emails, browser history, phone calls and whatever else they feel like collecting.

Sure, most (if not all) SANs are supported vie generic linux kernel drivers for HBAs, something like a QLogic card, or an exported iSCSI LUN. The issue is that you spent tons of money on the SAN and a truck load of money on hardware and software to hook up to that SAN. So you want to have a vender supported OS to go along with these items. If you have performance issues or stability issues, the first things a vender will ask is, what OS are you running, so they can direct you to the correct support group. The support group will want to debug the issue, so you have to generally run something like RHEL or Windows to get support. This might only be a mega corp issue though, since most startups don&#x27;t have Oracle/Sybase, fiber channel SANs, etc. To sum this up, in the mega corp world, if you are not running a vender supported OS, you likely cannot get support for your device.",1375495456

Each envelope having a password written on the outside and a password written on a piece of paper inside. The spy would give the guard the word that is written on one of the envelopes, the guard would then open the envelope and ask the spy for the password contained inside.",1292918372

And in the early days, while you're an LLC, your new colleagues might be willing to just have a promise of a certain amount of equity to be granted to them included in an employment contract, which will save you a bunch of legal fees up front, and will prevent you from having to include them as partners in your LLC, with all the extra hassle that would entail.<p>But make sure you put some restrictions or a vesting schedule on what you give out.

Particularly Oracle and the like.  These people typically spend money like it's water, so they're great customers and make Redhat lots of money.<p>Centos used to be wildly popular as the ""Free"" substitute for RHEL, but, back around 2009 or so, where Ubuntu actually started to get a reputation for (A) reliable releases (B) rock solid apt-gt support,  (C) a whiff of an ""Enterprise"" backing it (D) Canonical Support, and (E) lots of AMIs floating around (I see 22 for RHEL, 1053 for Ubuntu) - it picked up inertia on AWS.

Again, apologies, I'm sure you were just trying to add interesting information for other hackers.<p>'::' is not a punctuation symbol, at least not in English. It is two of the same symbol (colon) in succession.<p>Now in Hebrew, it may be considered a single symbol (though a cursory google makes me think Paamayim Nekudotayim might just be the Hebrew term for 'double-colon'). If Paamayim Nekudotayim were a single symbol in Hebrew, the term has certainly not migrated to English, at least outside the PHP community.<p>In programming languages, it is commonly used as a scope resolution operator, and dates back to C++ at least. In PHP, they often call it Paamayim Nekudotayim. But this does not mean that you would be correct to come across the syntax in a C++ source file and call it Paamayim Nekudotayim.<p>So to summarize:<p>- it is not a punctuation symbol
 - if it were, it would not be called that in English
 - it very likely isnt a single symbol in Hebrew
 - it is the scope resolution operator is _some_ languages
 - in those languages, it is not called Paamayim Nekudotayim, except in PHP.<p>(and after that rant, I fully expect to be proved wrong on some of those claims, which I will deserve).",1292917255
2027250,comment,2025122,2026968,0,0,pmcginn,,,"If you look at the history of health care, it didn't start out that way. Before World War II, people generally paid out of pocket for most medical expenses, but also carried health insurance for cataclysmic events.<p>In WWII, the US government imposed wage caps in an attempt to stop inflation.<p>Stuck offering the same wages, companies had to offer other perks to their employees to attract and retain the best and brightest, and often chose health insurance as one of said perks. As health insurance became too common to be considered a perk, and was just thought of as part of the standard package, companies expanded what they covered.<p>Eventually we got to a place where something as routine and expected as an annual checkup at the doctor's must be bargained down to a $5 copay.<p>The evolution of health care absolutely fascinates me. There is a pretty common thread of government intervention having far-reaching and often unseen implications.<p>Medical licensing, for example, is another reason why health care is so expensive. In Ye Olden Times, someone who wanted to set bones would apprentice, learn the art, and then set about it. If you broke a bone, you went to him. After medical licencing, and the expensive schooling it entails, you go to the emergency room, with all the associated costs.<p>Now, the obvious bright side is that a well-rounded, licensed doctor in an emergency room may recognize a secondary affliction that a bone-setter would have missed. Being forced to go to a doctor for something that's been done by tradesmen for ages probably saves lives.<p>But, it removes choice, and it raises costs.<p>How you're willing to balance those three is largely ideological.",1292917171

The first thing they tried was using one of those javascript/html systems. Its a fairly simple app that one would think was ideal for HTML/javascript, but it was barely usable and tech support was awful. Thats why they hired me.<p>What platforms are your target - the ""etc"" you mention? Blackberry? Blackberry is still huge but by iPhone and Android standards they are hardly smartphones. How about WP7? Interesting but so far tiny.<p>Next question: what kind of app? If its games, you use C/C++ and OpenGL for Android and iPhone.<p>Personally, I use C# and manage core business logic libraries with platform-specific user interfaces in Silverlight, MonoTouch and MonoDroid. I have a client who wants Android and later Blackberry, so for that we do the Android version in ""normal"" java so we can share libs with Blackberry in the future.<p>I don't think there's a one size fits all.

2027193,comment,2026765,2027061,0,0,fleitz,,,"Local Food, DIY, and Sustainability are not about inadequate price signals for climate change and peak oil. They are about creating consumer surplus via PR, and nostalgia for early 20th century farming techniques. Admittedly, most people in the industry have no idea that this is what they are doing, but thats the beauty of good PR and healthy dose of nostalgia.<p>That is to say the reason most people pay the price premium for organo-locavore food is that it makes them believe they are better people, not because they believe that futures contracts for degree days are mispriced. Walk into a Whole Foods and ask what the appropriate prices of a heating degree day is once climate change and peak oil are priced in and they will give you a blank look.

People who believe that climate change and peak oil are mispriced in the market not opening organic rooftop urban gardens, they are opening trading accounts (and will make a killing if they are right)",1292915288

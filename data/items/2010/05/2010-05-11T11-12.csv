If you climb, your mind will be _instantly_ free of all everyday business.<p>Imo the easiest way to start is finding a beginner climbing group around your location; there are plenty - especially in the US and Europe.",1273579036

I'm guessing they have weighed the advantages of having scroogle out there versus the disadvantages of a bunch of bad press. They might even think it is good to have sites that are openly critical of google out there.<p>Scroogle should count their blessings that it has lasted as long as it did, now they should get their act together and fix the bugs in their scraper.",1273578788

There's is an art to it...<p>Basically, if you want to start a conversation with a stranger then I'd recommend doing it in a place where they can 'escape' from you.  If you corner them, say on the tube, then they have no means of leaving and hence they will feel as if your approach is hostile.  And that's especially true if you are both sitting or face to face.<p>I recommend reading Strauss' book because it's fascinating, but the bottom line is approach people from an angle (not head on and not from behind).  Make sure they've got the physical space to leave if they want to, maintain enough distance that you are not in their personal space, and if you do get chatting it can be helpful to indicate in some way that you are only temporarily there talking to them.",1273578755

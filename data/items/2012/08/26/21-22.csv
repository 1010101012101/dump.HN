I have seen two\nyear old kids able to use ipads. This was their innovation and it has\nwon them millions (billions?) of loyal fans.<p>This was so radically different than the prevailing ethos in the tech\nindustry at the time that their supporters feel they should be\nprotected or rewarded for changing the industry.<p>However, there is a problem in granting protection for these types of\ninnovations, in that we are setting a dangerous precedent for patents\nand innovation. The individual user interface elements that make up\nthe iPhone, by themselves, are all relatively obvious. Swiping to turn\na page is the natural evolution of the book. Movies like Minority\nReport suggest the range of gestures we can imagine given the\nappropriate technology. It's quite a stretch to suggest that something\nso similar to what we have done all our lives should be protected by\nlaw and in effect create a protected monoply and prevent others from\nusing these ideas in their products.<p>Instead those that admire Apple and what they have done should\ncontinue to do what they have been doing, buy their\nproducts.<p>As someone who has owned multiple ipads, ipods, iphones, and mac\nbooks, I know how compelling their products are and the loyalty it\nbreeds in their users. Therefore, I think it is unlikely that many\nwill step back and think whether this really is the best result for\nour industry.",1346017874

As a private, for-profit company who raised money for AIDS and cancer non-profit organizations, they had a business model that was quite controversial. While their rides and walks were popular with the participants, and they raised a lot of money, the entire non-profit sector was ambivalent about them.

4436344,comment,4435190,4435982,13,0,jdietrich,,,"The basis for my comment on the autoimmune is relatively poorly documented, because by definition it happened outside of academic literature. A bit of intelligent Googling will turn up a great deal of lay discussion that substantially pre-dates the earliest peer-reviewed publications on the subject. It is clear from perusing the relevant discussion forums that there are a great many parents who are advocating the autoimmune hypothesis; While this of course has no bearing on the validity of the theory itself, it is highly pertinent when considering the theory's prominence in the mainstream media.<p>As regards autism and IQ, your analogy to schizophrenia is completely inaccurate. Someone with high IQ can develop strategies to ameliorate essentially every aspect of their autistic symptoms - learning social and communication skills, structuring their life to deal with overstimulation, participating in behavioural therapy to minimise repetitive and autostimulative behaviours etc. Schizophrenics are by definition unaware that their delusional beliefs are delusional, whereas any intelligent autistic can be made aware of their social deficits and behavioural quirks and can learn to adapt around them.<p>As you said, some autistic people have high IQ in some areas but are still unable to live a normal life, but this is because their cognitive problems render them unable to overcome their autism symptoms. A specific cognitive impairment is still a cognitive impairment - strong arms do not nullify paraplegia.<p>While it may be the case that there are some individuals that have high IQ but severe levels of impairment, they are very much outliers. There is no generally-accepted classification for the severity of autism symptoms, but it is worth noting that those systems which simply use IQ are not obviously less useful than more complex schemes; IQ correlates as strongly with functional impairment as any other factor.",1346017528

So, that's the extent of the claim.<p>Going by the quote from the juror: ""In fact we skipped that one,"", it matches up with the claim.<p>Claim: They skipped a question.\nQuote: We skipped a question.<p>I think it's fair to say they skipped a question.<p>Even you admit to this with your own quote: ""As far as I can tell, there's no evidence from those quotes that they skipped prior art, so much as skipped the task to move forward on others before circling back around to it.""  You say here that there is no evidence that they skipped, but there is evidence the skipped the question and most probably eventually came back to it later.<p>However, skipping did occur, which was the original contention backed up by statements from those who would know.<p>It would seem that you are the one trying to invent, poorly, as you can't even avoid contradicting yourself in your own comment.<p>But, you might ask, why would skipping and coming back matter as long as they addressed the question.<p>Context.  The questions were ordered in a specific order.  Addressing them out of order is, in essence, answering the questions ""out of context.""  Indeed, the quotes suggest (though admittedly not directly) that by skipping the question, they were able to continue.  But if that question had been answered as they had expected it to, would it have impacted the outcome?  I believe so.<p>After all, the context in which you answer a question determines the answer (which is fairly obvious).<p>In the end, you are trying to paint the jurors in a different light.  One in which they abided by the rules set forth (which they've already admitted to not doing[1]) and using the worksheets provided to reach the judgement (again, something they've admitted to modifying).<p>So no, I'm not inventing anything.  Couple that with the ""expertise"" offered by a patent holder, it's fairly obvious there are issues with the ruling.<p>That all being said, maybe it's okay the jury ignore the provided worksheets and rewrote them.  Maybe it's okay that they ignore instructions given to them by the judge.  After all, they are the jury, and they our last line of defense.  If we can ask a jury to find someone innocent facing an unjust law, we can expect them to make their voice heard in other cases as well.<p>Regardless, my point still stands: They skipped a question, they admitted to it, as did you, and you seem foolishly trying to take on other conditions as if somehow that makes the ""fact"" untrue.<p>Honestly, how can you even suggest they didn't skip the question, and then say they did, and try to blame someone else for inventing false narratives?  I mean, besides being dishonest?<p>[1] They were instructed: ""You should keep in mind that the damages you award are meant to compensate the patent holder and not to punish an infringer.""  However, what they ""wanted to make sure the message we sent was not just a slap on the wrist. We wanted to make sure it was sufficiently high to be painful, but not unreasonable.""",1346017190

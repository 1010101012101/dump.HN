539866,comment,539852,539852,0,0,swombat,,,"The elephant in the room of this whole OnLive games thing is, why the heck are they bothering with video games?<p>If they have a technology that's capable of remoting games (which are some of the most demanding consumer applications imaginable), then the whole ""Linux vs Mac vs Windows"" debate is moot. If it can remote 3D, fast action games, it can remote whole OS's with ease. That's surely a 100x bigger market than games.<p>That, to me, casts huge doubts on their claims... it's like someone claiming they've solved cold fusion and are using it to power really strong, long-lasting flashlights.",1238493216

Sometimes it was there already when I did a late night check. SO makes me more productive. My boss does not exactly object to that.",1238492639

I know at least 50 people with 1400+ SATs (on a 1600 scale) and only one of them is really into classical.<p>That statistic is wrong on so many levels. In particular, SAT scores correlate to the level of education, which correlates to the wealth of the family, the area they live and, therefore, the music they would be exposed to.",1238491973

539850,comment,539491,539491,0,0,BjornW,,,"I use some chairs that were in use by a local supermarket and which got thrown out due changes in the interior. It may sound silly, but keep in mind that the people behind the counter need to set for long periods of time just like your average hacker. These chairs can be lifted to the point where I (my height: 1.96m) cannot put my feet straight on the ground anymore, have several 'joints' to setup and are the most comfy chairs I've ever used. I don't know the brand, so you probably need to ask at your local supermarket. Best of all I got mine for free.",1238491484

539841,comment,539814,539826,0,0,bdfh42,,,"Getting more complex now you are into the detail. Partly, things depend upon the laws applicable in a given instance. In some cases copyright has to be explicitly claimed and in other jurisdictions it is implicit. This has been touched on at HN before - CSS code (and JavaScript, HTML etc) is effectively open in that it is generally available to be read by all but it may still be 'owned' in the sense that copyright will often still apply.<p>Perhaps one should apply a 'moral' filter. It seems OK (if not inevitable) for one's designs to be strongly influenced by the layout and colour schemes of existing sites but it also seems proper that one should not copy CSS and layouts wholesale from elsewhere. There are plenty of tutorial sites demonstrating the most complex of CSS code - copy from them where it encouraged and then apply your own unique 'spin'.",1238490591

The second something better comes along, or Twitter decides to switch to something else, or they attempt to monetize it by inserting ads or something there will be a mass exodus.<p>Of course there's always the possibility that the bit.ly folks pitched some grand vision we don't know about to their investors.<p>On a related note, I have a feeling our reliance on URL shortening services is going to bite us in the ass in the future. When one of these service goes out of business you're left with thousands or millions of essentially dangling pointers. It also throws a monkey wrench into PageRank type algorithms.",1238490567

Try asking a challenging question and you are just as likely to find an old blog post with an answer as a StackOverflow answer. Now, I think SO has it's place. For instance when you are picking up a new language that is used in the industry. But I've rarely found answers there recently (C#, VB.NET or Lisp...).<p>I agree that they are improving and that some of the these rare challenging questions are beginning to be answered (Woot no complaints).

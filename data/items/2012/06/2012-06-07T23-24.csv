A Type 2 error is aggressive rejection of change for the status quo, even though the status quo isn't right any longer (not crying wolf!).<p>There is no way to escape these errors, and depending on evidence, you'll sway one way or another (these errors always exist and are complementary in nature). The financial crisis looked like it <i>could</i> blow up the world (there might be a wolf in the flock!). Assuming status quo - that nothing is happening (no wolf) - you might not prepare for it (a wolf), and if the world blew up you'd lose everything (wolf eats you!). Assuming change (hello wolf!), you prepare and adapt for the crisis where you have to lose a bit (growth/funding/employees sadly), but if it all goes down - you are prepared (wolf meet gun!).<p>This is an example of the precautionary principle at work, and based on my understanding, Sequoia did an outstanding job. The Federal Reserve also did a great job (during the crisis). I have no opinion about the lax rates in the lead up to the bubble - but I presume that was highly detrimental to our collective financial health! :D<p>Sequoia are the best in the business, they've been around the block a couple of times, and all they care about is making sure their companies survive. <i>RIP Good Times was prudent.</i><p>Better to cry wolf, than to not do so, and be eaten while you sleep.<p>When the cost/benefit balance changes, assume catastrophe, minimise chances of a Type 2 error (bias yourself towards change - a Type 1 error), and plan for the worst thing that you can possibly imagine - think of it like paying for insurance against storm damage if the data shows a few too many clouds over the Atlantic.<p><i>A false positive error, commonly called a ""false alarm"" is a result that indicates a given condition has been fulfilled, when it actually has not been fulfilled. In the case of ""crying wolf"" - the condition tested for was ""is there a wolf near the herd?"", the actual result was that there had not been a wolf near the herd. The shepherd wrongly indicated there was one, by calling ""Wolf, wolf!"".</i><p><i>In terms of folk tales, an investigator may be ""crying wolf"" without a wolf in sight (raising a false alarm) (H0: no wolf).</i><p><i>A false positive (with null hypothesis of health) in medicine causes unnecessary worry or treatment, while a false negative gives the patient the dangerous illusion of good health and the patient might not get an available treatment.</i> [1]<p>The future is very uncertain. Act accordingly.<p>Or as our ancestors would say:<p><i>If you hear any type of rustling in the bushes; always assume that it's a tiger trying to kill you.

When something goes wrong with your application, you either accept the blame, or you make the customers feel like they broke something.

Gotta be honest, that seems like a wild and illogical extrapolation to me based on this anecdotal story.</i><p>This is not the only inference you can make. Something that I've noticed about domestic law-enforcement, which I think successfully extrapolates and pertains to the DHS and TSA, is that <i>outlying behavior is discouraged</i>, especially outlying behavior associated with volatile keywords. How many times have I done something unusual, and stopped when the police come by because I just don't know if it's legal or not, and I don't want to get hassled?!<p>The law is so extensive and arcane that enforcement relies almost entirely on precedent and patterns rather than direct application, especially when dealing with rarer violations.<p>The result is systematic harassment with no end-game required. It's a policy that kind of sneaks up on institutions as big as the US Govt: discourage interesting, dissenting behavior; encourage boring, mainstream behavior. It doesn't require passing a law - it's an emergent behavior that only requires extra scrutiny of behavior that is outside the experience of the enforcer. This will tend to get worse with scale and the application of technology because a) more people are scrutinized and b) more of their life will be scrutinized, increasing the risk of finding outlying behavioral points.",1339113156

Which is to say it is when you don't lie, but you can lie if you know what you want.<p>When you reverse map an IP you look up b4.b3.b2.b1.in-addr.arpa. where b1 - b4 are bytes 1 through 4 (in reverse order) of the IP address. So 10.1.2.3 becomes 3.2.1.10.in-addr.arpa. The interesting bit is you send this to <i>some</i> dns resolver, typically in the 'generic' world your machine got the address of a resolver (and maybe a backup) from the DHCP server that gave it the IP address. When <i>that</i> dns server sees this request what it is <i>supposed</i> to do is to either tell you to 'go fish' and here is the IP of a server than can help, or 'recursively resolve' by forwarding on your request. Now if you run a vanilla BIND or djbdns setup you will get short circuited by it recognizing a 'private' address and not resolving it, if it did try the root servers tell you to go away as well. But if you recognized it as a private address and sent it back to xip.io DNS servers on a lark, <i>they</i> could ""pretend"" to be authorative for the domain and return you a cname record that pointed back to your fake name.<p>I admit it is a hack on top of another hack but as long as we're writing custom DNS servers why not go all in? :-)",1339112911

You're thinking rationally when you should be thinking emotionally. Customers are hugely inconvenienced by downtime, but there's nothing to be done about it. You just need to get them to calm down and remember that you're someone they like doing business with, and this is just an unfortunate mistake that's outside of your control. Like everyone else has already mentioned, everyone knows that websites go down, so customers can deal with it as long as you give them some peace of mind[1].<p>Here's a related anecdote: it's common for potential customers to ask me about security before signing up. I used to actually answer them by explaining the details of our security practices, but no one understood what I was talking about. Now I tell people that the site is hosted on Amazon's servers so we can take advantage of the infrastructure they've built. Obviously this is a non-answer, but it makes people feel a lot better. They knew they wouldn't be able to evaluate our security anyway, they just wanted some sign that they can trust us (and they already trusted us because we're the only company that picks up the phone when they call).<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that when you're dealing with technology, it's good to be rational.

One stat that surprised us - O'Reilly's work on stats and analysis is amazingly thorough - was the percentage of attendees who <i>have never been to a conference before</i> and/or who have <i>little to no exposure to the JS developer world</i>. This was reflected in a very diverse attendee base demographically (honestly, I've not met so many women at a tech event before).<p>Many of the attendees who were not speakers or people I knew, at least the ones I spoke to, had heard of O'Reilly (obviously!) but didn't know about things like my JavaScript Weekly, other events like JSConf, or even superheroes like Paul Irish(!) Terms like WebGL and Node were new to many.<p>This surprised and delighted me, because it made me realize O'Reilly/Fluent should hopefully not tread on JSConf or similar conferences' awesome toes. As a large share of the audience is fresh to the ""scene"" or otherwise not well connected, they may become more experienced and connected enough over time to ""level up"" and get to love user groups, more community-run conferences, JSConf, informal events, hackathons, and so forth. I hope that is a win for everyone ultimately. Events like beer.js can only help to win people over and bring them into that fold. (Personally, <i>I</i> would be more than happy for Fluent attendees to be shown things like JSConf, community meetups, etc, and to realize what they mean and why they matter. Maybe we could work on this next year.)<p>From both my and O'Reilly's point of view (although I'm not an official spokesperson for them) there is no animosity with other events and O'Reilly is keen to use its strengths (such as getting in those unconnected types, enterprise folks, and similar groups) rather than undermine the strengths of others. There have been allusions to things ""going on in private"" which I have no idea about (yet seem to get the blame for by certain people) but my experience with O'Reilly and their attitude to other conferences and their organizers has been nothing but positive.<p>(Consider that HTML5DevConf was also in downtown SF a week before Fluent, it was only $100 or so, and was smack bang covering the same topics.. very direct competition, yet the folks at O'Reilly were genuinely unconcerned - no emergency meetings! - were supportive of the event, and thought it could only serve to help the community.)<p>I hope I can encourage O'Reilly to coordinate more with community events like beer.js and to make the experience more fun and better value for attendees generally. But, likewise, I think it would be wrong for O'Reilly to flat out copy JSConf or similar events because those events really nail a certain type of atmosphere and deserve their well earned esteem.",1339111079

4081799,story,,,1,0,PetroFeed,"Semi-Synthetic Social Networks: The next big thing?",,"So far most social networks are user generated. A semi-synthetic social network is one where computer generated content is just as valuable as user generated.<p>Think about what makes social network's so efficient for intelligence and communication. Entities in the network are represented with profiles. The profiles have background information and a stream of new or changing intelligence information. The profiles also act as an intuitive node to connect related information.<p>Users sign up and create a feed by defining some filters that determine what intelligence information will be streamed to them.<p>The entities all have relationships which enrich the ability to filter/discover content and manage communication permissions efficiently.<p>Typically users register and create their own profile with their background information. They then continually populate the system with intelligence such as pictures, videos, status updates and so on.<p>They can interact with intelligence documents in the network by posting comments and due tot he relationships the new intelligence elements can be streamed thus create contextual conversations.<p>So far this concept has mostly been limited to intelligence about people. Facebook for example supports intelligence and communication about people's personal lives.<p>However some people have figured out how to apply the higher level concept of data organization to support other kinds of intelligence. Quora is a good example. Instead of just focusing on people as primary level entities you also have questions and topics. By creating relationships between these entities you can vastly improve the filtering/discovery of intelligence while also creating contextual conversation (aka answers).<p>I think there are many other cases and one of them requires semi-synthetic networks. To give an example we are in the oil and gas space. Entities people want intelligence about in our industry range from wells to facilities to pipelines to commodities to geographic areas to companies and of course people. Most of these entities have daily intelligence information that range from status updates to licenses to ownership changes and so on.<p>Since they can't update themselves we monitor the static data sets and programmatically use the event data to create/update profiles and generate and post stories on their behalf. The result is a rich network of thousands of entities with complex relationships the are generating endless valuable content...and all before the first user joins. When a suer joins they create their own profile and design feeds that enable them to easily monitor activity in the network.<p>Users can then post comments on activity posts, like a well license for example, and chose who that is shared with. Even though the well license story was posted as if the company did it they can still contextually connect with the people they work with. And, of course, the story/post was actually system generated without that company even knowing we posted it.
---<p>The point of sharing this is not to explain my business but to expand people's paradigm of what a social network is and how the concepts can be expanded beyond just being about supporting intelligence about people.<p>It's time to rethink what a social network is. It's time to start thinking of them as networked intelligence and communication systems. What kind of intelligence are your customers looking for and what can you learn from the way social networks structure data and connect people around it?

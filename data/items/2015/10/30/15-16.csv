This means you can compile ordinary Rust code into a single executable and run that executable on any machine with a compatible version of libc (which is fairly universally available, so not a problem in practice).<p>If you want no dynamic dependencies whatsoever, then Rust supports linking to musl, which is an implementation of libc that&#x27;s designed for static linking.",1446220725

Its almost the perfect prisoner&#x27;s dilemma right? Apple defected and everyone else co-operated so they got the most benefit?<p>As a strategy I have observed that people with too much secrecy lose out on innovations that people outside the process could illuminate, but as a strategy it has a history of helping the company employing it stay ahead of the game. Look at Google&#x27;s secrecy about its data centers, had it gone public with that stuff when it was done, perhaps 2 trillion kwH of power could have been used to do something else if other people had adopted those things. But instead it just helped Google grow faster and do more with their stuff. Is it bad for Google? No. Bad for the rest of us? Perhaps but we don&#x27;t know one way or the other.<p>So when Apple&#x27;s efforts fail to produce a competitive product, then I think you can say its hurting itself, but until then I&#x27;m sure they see it as a competitive advantage.",1446220608

The boards are very heavy for a surfboard, with poor rigidity and flex, and in fact they don&#x27;t even attempt to target the &quot;real shortboard&quot; market, where extreme light weight, stiffness and a very delicately balanced flex work together to form something that lets you nimbly glide along a decent-sized wave on a board slightly shorter than you are.<p>Basically, the best form of manufacture for surfboards is a core of either high-quality rigid foam (not the heavy, flexible foam used in wavestorm/some pop-outs) or air, covered in substances like fiberglass and/or carbon-fiber fabric and minimal amounts of epoxies (sometimes using the same vacuum techniques as other carbon-fiber manufacturing to minimize weight). I said &#x27;foam or air&#x27; because for a while people have been predicting that we&#x27;d move to hollow carbon-fiber boards, and there are/have been some of those boards, but they have their drawbacks and are often expensive.<p>Can performance surfboards be disrupted? It&#x27;s already happened, to a certain extent. Channel Islands and other surfboard brands use automated milling of the foam blanks, and other automated processes as well.<p>Too, any overseas contenders have to worry about shipping. Surfboards are huge -- you could fit 20 <i>boxed</i> iphones in the footprint of a single boxed shortboard. At the price points mentioned ($300-$500), overseas shipping would probably eat into your margin. Shipping is even an issue for domestic producers; often shipping a board halfway across the country can cost $50-$100. Which is a nice bit of extra margin for a local shaper and his customers.<p>When will <i>good</i> surfboards get cheap? Probably when great carbon-fiber bikes get cheap, ie, when carbon-fiber manufacture is so well mastered by man that designs in any shape can be pumped out like Lego.",1446218382

Think how you would react were you in full control of a car in that instance.  You have a virtually stopped lane of traffic to your right, you see cars braking about 100 ft ahead of you.  Wouldn&#x27;t you start slowing down?  I would, as clearly travelling as fast as the driver is where all surrounding traffic is slowing or stopped doesn&#x27;t make sense, however the driver doesn&#x27;t appear to slow down at all, by his own admission focused on the cars to his right.  Was he legitimately distracted by cars to his right, or was he depending on the car&#x27;s situational awareness?

In C++, you have to explicitly call std::move(), and checks to make sure you don&#x27;t reference the old one happen at runtime.<p>Rust also does safer checking of use of references. In C++, it&#x27;s possible to return a reference to a stack variable which is no longer valid. In Rust, the lifetimes of references are tracked statically, so you can never have a dangling reference.<p>So, while the RAII pattern, use of smart pointers, and use of references, will feel fairly familiar to someone familiar with modern C++, they are actually generally more convenient and more safe in Rust.<p>Rust does not have classes. You define plain old data structures, and use traits to provide polymorphic behavior. Traits are somewhat like interfaces which can contain default implementations of methods. Traits can be used to constrain types. Traits can be used to provide either static (compile time) dispatch, or runtime dispatch, depending on whether the object is monomorphized at compile time or accessed through a fat pointer that includes a vtable to dispatch at runtime.<p>Rust provides generics which fill a similar niche to templates in C++. In some ways, they are more powerful as arguments can be constrained by traits; in some ways they are less powerful than C++ templates.<p>For an introduction to traits in Rust, take a look at the book: <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html</a><p>Rust doesn&#x27;t provide operator overloading directly, but use of operators is equivalent to just calling a method defined on a particular trait in Rust.

There was nothing in the previous version of the OS agreement to suggest that cross-compilation would somehow be banned in future versions.  All because Steve Jobs, loves Obj-C.  Now how isn't that screwing people's livelihood?",1274007534

""Conning"" says too much, but Apple does promise a lot of things that are not really true. Their computers are not that easy to use and not free of problems.<p>A lot of people have been led to believe that their computing problems will all go away if they switch to Apple, which simply isn't true.",1274006847
1351808,comment,1350583,1351175,0,0,m0nty,,,"> Where is the magical divide between ""art"" and ""science"" in the field?<p>We need to revive the word ""artisan"" which has connotations both of technical ability and artistic sensibility. Look at it like that, and programmers are no different from thousands of generations of craftsmen from here to the pyramids. It's just that the tools of our trade are usually far more complex than theirs. (Although I still have no idea how to build a pyramid.)<p>I think this is why some people like to compare programming to painting or writing or whatever their <i>other</i> life's endeavour is. I don't think there is a direct correlation between programming and those other things, but you start using the same parts of the brain for parts of both activities, so it feels as though it's roughly the same.<p>So here's my comparison between programming and writing: every word must be relevant, there is no redundancy, no unnecessary repetition. Good code and good writing must be tight, clean and comprehensible. I mentioned this to a co-worker once and he said ""I'd never thought about it like that. I think it's more to do with mathematics."" Which it also is.",1274006752

1351806,comment,1350508,1350704,0,0,lsc,,,"speaking as someone who didn't go to college, I kindof agree.  I mean, I don't know if I agree with the 'more tolerant' bit, but certainly, more liberal and better able to get along with other people who have college degrees, more likely to understand (or at least pretend to understand) modern art, etc...<p>There are also other, harder to define social changes.  The most negative side of this is that I know people who earn 1/5th what I do who won't lower themselves to replacing the brakes on their car.   I mean, 'round these parts, mechanics charge $70-$90 an hour.   Not many of us make more than that after taxes.    This unwillingness to 'break the rules'  and accomplish what you need to accomplish can be a pretty big problem.<p>I don't know if it is what college teaches, or if this is simply what college filters for, but it seems that people who went to school have a narrower view of what they are able/willing to do.  (Not as narrow as what one learns in service jobs, but still pretty narrow compared to those of us who do work that 'requires' a degree without having one.)<p>I mean, that's not always true.  I know many English majors turned programmers, some who have become really excellent,  and a ridiculous number of physicists turned programmers.  But College, in general, seems to come with a diminished respect for industry, especially the trades and working with your hands in general (unless it is 'art')  - see discussions here about programming as an art.  to some people, it seems, you are somehow insulting programming by comparing it to the work of an electrician, a bricklayer or other tradesman, which to me absolutely sings of arrogance.",1274006689

1351802,comment,1342172,1342172,0,0,trimber,,,"I believe most enterprise systems are fairly expensive. Maybe you would consider building your own system? I have done a similar thing, by writing a plugin for Google Desktop Search that indexes TIF files. Writing a plugin is pretty straightforward. Now for the OCR part, there is only a few Open Source OCR engines, the most popular being Tesseract. The quality of Tesseract's results is pretty good and I believe is sufficient for many systems.",1274006322

Even though it's not <i>that</i> efficient to write the implementation of LISP in LISP, it's practically possible with 37 operators. There has to be something with these languages where you can write the language in itself.<p>To be completely honest, I'm somewhat astonished that speed is one of the reasons to write the core in itself: Usually you would think it would be a reason to write it in a low level language.",1274006229
1351799,comment,1351479,1351719,0,0,keemoboy,,,"I agree with both these points, but I disagree that wanting yourself and others on your team to be paid for the work you do, no more, no less, is the same thing as being entrepreneurial.  There are many attributes that make someone entrepreneurial and there are many reasons people don't just start their own businesses.  Getting paid for the work you do instead of being on a salary definitely has similar unpredictability, so it needs someone to be less risk averse than they're used to in their regular 9-5, but I think it's much more about freedom and fairness and these are qualities any engineer (or human being for that matter) craves.  If I know I will get paid exactly for what I do I'm free to work as hard or as little as I want depending on my interest in the current project and whatever personal circumstances come my way.  There isn't this unhealthy pull/push that happens in partnerships where people are constantly expected to do x% of the work.  And I'm also free to not let my work rule my life, I'm in complete control.  I think those who want to get paid for exactly the work they do are more akin to freelancers than entrepreneurs, emphasis on the 'free' :)",1274006140

I have already retracted the blanket edict in my reply to compay. Consider it doubly-retracted. Of course, I respect everyone's right to express their opinion.<p>What I'm getting here from _why's detractors is that your animosity towards _why is bound up with your animosity towards Ruby. I have never understood language wars. Each language brings something different to the party. I learn different languages just for the fun of it. We can be competitive and cheerlead our own corner but it's tedious when people start spewing bile.<p>I don't think you can project your childhood emotions onto _why's pulling of his online presence. We can only guess at why he did what he did. He disappearance and removing of the code and so forth that he was in control of does pose interesting questions in this age where source-code is shared and diaries are public. If it's important enough people will have copies and keep a hold of the bits they like. I can see how it would annoy somebody to feel like something of worth could be removed from the world so easily but maybe we'll have to get used to that. You could argue that _why had a social responsibility to not do what he did but surely we must allow him some personal autonomy as well.<p>For my part I'll try to understand your perspective but could you also try to appreciate mine?

They are about writing cross platform programs that are not running on a flash plugin on the iPhone but are cross compiled to ObjC.<p>The ""but developers can choose whether they want to write their programm for iPhone OS or for other platforms""-argument is so ridiculous, it makes me cry. In practice people have no choice but to develop for iPhone OS (because it's the biggest app platform) and then, if money/time/effort allows, write a second app for the rest of the world. And i think, as a developer i can complain and bitch all day about it, even if it won't change something. Of course, Steve can do whatever he likes with the platform.

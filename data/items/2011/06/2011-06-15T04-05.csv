As soon as you've reached a certain level of <i>easy</i> becoming <i>easier</i> doesn't give you as much gain.  The advantages of native applications certainly outweigh the tiny extra work on installation.<p>App store installation does have one other advantage: a sense of ownership.  The user feels they own the app rather than merely visiting it -- psychologically that is a powerful difference.",1308113994

It's basically the same as Amazon Web Services.

2656029,comment,2654599,2654599,3,0,bruce511,,,"There seems to be something of a disconnect between the tech community and everyone else when it comes to Groupon. Investors clearly love it, it seems plenty of businesses are using it, and equally gazillions of people are buying them. I suspect, popular HN stories to the contrary, they'll successfully IPO later and won't collapse as fast as some hope.<p>Sure it's not for all businesses, and some will have a bad experience. Some business owners can't do math - some just aren't well suited to a group on model. Does that invalidate the whole company? I think not.<p>Sure, as a Groupon buyer you'll get plenty of deal offers for stuff you're not interested in. Well duh! I'm guessing that's been the case since day 1 anyway and it seems to be working regardless.<p>So why all the hate on tech blogs and commentaries? Might it be just a little bit of sour grapes? After all Groupon raised over a billion in capital (so if _I_ can't get a lousy million for my idea, what does that make me?) Worse most of the billion was not so much capital raised as a straight share sale. The reaction to other VC spends lately (notably the 40 million for Color) seems to fuel my hypothesis that most techies hate the success of others. They're playing this as some sort of zero-sum game.<p>It's also hard to get excited about someone else's success when it seems like such a simple idea. After all anyone can enter the same space - the barrier to entry is low (as plenty of clones will attest to.) But while clones always exist there is only one eBay, one Amazon, one Facebook, one Twitter. I suspect there will be one Groupon. As with most of these things, they're simple ideas, but require a lot of traction and good implementation to do well.<p>I say good for you Groupon. I say, let the seller of Groupons do the math before doing business, and let the buyers take advantage of what appeals to them. And maybe, just maybe, us techie folk could stand up once in a while, and say ""well done"" without begrudging them their success.<p>Of course Groupon might fail. Of course their IPO might suck. That can happen to any company. But we're acting like spoilt children, stamping our feet and complaining that life is unfair.",1308113828

2655987,comment,2655796,2655796,5,0,siculars,,,"Ya, that sounds about right. The sad truth is that defending our cyber space, or cyber space in general, is a Sisyphean task. No one can do it, least of all the government. There are just too many vectors of attack and too many targets and, frankly, not enough people who know anything about cyber-security. Even people who do know about security are routinely hacked, see Google, RSA, Lockheed, et al.<p>The only rational way to combat catastrophic cyber warfare is to disuade our enemies from engaging in it. Some say it has worked for us before, MAD[0] (note section on criticism, which obviously plays here). As mentioned in the WSJ[1] a few weeks ago:<p>""One idea gaining momentum at the Pentagon is the notion of ""equivalence."" If a cyber attack produces the death, damage, destruction or high-level disruption that a traditional military attack would cause, then it would be a candidate for a ""use of force"" consideration, which could merit retaliation.""<p>This notion that a cyber attack could result in a real military response must be delivered to the highest levels of decision making throughout the world. We can only hope that the message is received.<p>Obviously, we must do all we can on defense but no defense will be foolproof. It is just not possible. Stating our intentions in the event of a devastating cyber attack is the only real option we have.<p>Everything short of national catastrophe should be dealt with in other ways. Industrial espionage is a major consideration but that should be taken to arbitrage at forums like the WTO. I'm all for free trade and everything it has to offer as long as there is an even playing field. At the risk of conflating issues I will simply say that China's ongoing espionage is an extension of unfair trading practices that work to create an uneven playing field between them and everyone else.<p>[0]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304563104576355623135782718.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405270230456310457635...</a>",1308112455

Sure, it&#x27;s simplistic and it&#x27;s how to keep it quite that straightforward, but to see that number and be ignorant enough of the context to trivialise it and call it not a big deal is pretty disingenuous. Sure, a 2.5 K (or something like it) rise isn&#x27;t going to bring the downfall of civilisation per se. But there&#x27;s more to it than that.

If you&#x27;re seriously wedded to the idea that consensus is important to the science, you should dig up the independent opinions of a few other computational physicists (not climate scientists, who are not computational physicists). Having done so, you might find that there is a consensus amongst computational physicists that climate models are problematic in ways that make them questionable guides to policy, although most of us will also say that we should be concerned about the amount of garbage we are dumping into the atmosphere (and there are reasons to want to get off fossil fuels that go beyond the climate change argument.)<p>Denialists have poisoned the public discourse on climate change, but Warmists have unfortunately responded by digging in their heels in a particularly anti-scientific way. I hope Koonin&#x27;s piece will help bring the scientific discussion back to fundamentals, and perhaps decouple the policy discussion from models a bit.<p>For example: we know that carbon taxes work pretty well in reducing CO2 emissions (<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/the-insidious-truth-about-bcs-carbon-tax-it-works/article19512237/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/the-insidious-tr...</a>) and we know that carbon taxes can be used to reduce corporate and income taxes. So anyone who is opposed to carbon taxes is necessarily in favour of higher corporate and income taxes.<p>This is a policy discussion that can and should be had independently of any detailed climate model results, and I invite everyone who is in favour of higher corporate and income taxes to chime in here in support of their position, and explain why those taxes are so much better than the carbon taxes that could partially replace them.",1411168622

But, none of the servers I mentioned are a significant contributor to latency when configured appropriately for the workload. Apache has competent concurrency options on modern systems (including libevent), as does nginx.<p>Certainly performance is nice. I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t. But, the webserver is going to spend most of its time waiting on your application and your database. I&#x27;d like to see folks more focused on standards-compliant behavior, secure behavior, etc. That&#x27;s not as easy as slapping up an ab benchmark, but it&#x27;s more useful in helping me decide if a new server is appropriate for my needs, and it&#x27;s helpful in moving the state of the art forward on fronts that are far more important than squeezing another bajillion requests out of hardware that can already serve a bajillion requests.<p>Another interesting angle is memory usage. Apache <i>does</i> require more memory than nginx or, presumably, H2O. It&#x27;s not a huge difference, if Apache is configured as minimally as nginx is, by default, but it&#x27;s notable on a very high concurrency system. In the &quot;Internet of things&quot;, small embeddable web servers will be important. If H2O uses less memory than nginx, that&#x27;d be interesting (I think more interesting than performance). But, memory usage isn&#x27;t really mentioned anywhere that I see...if a memory graph were beside the ab benchmarks, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have even complained about the benchmarks being so prominent.

I still don&#x27;t stock beer in my fridge, but when I go to bars, beergardens, I do get a glass.<p>Beer is really an acquired taste, but I do like its taste. I tend to drink after a lot of beer, so I don&#x27;t get drunk, I do feel a little buzz though.<p>As a teetotaller for my whole life, what do I feel? The main reason I stayed away from alcohol was my fear of addiction. And that fear is still there...I don&#x27;t want to drown my sorrows with alcohol, ever. I want to be able to feel the complete pain, get over it, and move ahead with life.<p>So my advice is: you have a choice. You don&#x27;t need to drink a lot. But one beer and a few shots won&#x27;t make you drunk. On the contrary, it makes you appear much more sociable. It sounds like a cop-out, sure. But each to his own, I guess.",1411167700

So we get crap like, &quot;Faced with change, an all-female indie dev team evolves to a higher form&quot; .  This is a completely meaningless title for a link but I click on it anyway, find a wall of text, try reading a bit to see what it is about and...nothing.<p>It&#x27;s not that I have a short attention span.  I have multiple options and delving into an unknown article which has the only merit of being linked from hn just isn&#x27;t good enough if they don&#x27;t want me to know what it&#x27;s about either.<p>At least if I have an idea what they&#x27;re aiming for I can read it critically, but no luck there either.  I despair that people can write so well and yet write such crap.",1411167612

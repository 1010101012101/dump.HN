It seemed that each time they introduced a bunch of new features, the crashing, hanging, and erratic behavior (e.g. breaking at a line of source code far removed from the actual breakpoint) got worse. Happily, though, the last release before this current one reversed that trend. It didn't eliminate the problems but it did make them tolerable, which was a relief. I hope this one doesn't revive the previous tradition!<p>I think part of the problem is that FB wasn't designed to work with large (or even medium-sized) JS programs. We bundle all our JS into one HTTP request. It's a few thousand lines, which is big enough to cause FB noticeable trouble. A lot of the fancy features they've been adding are pretty useless to me; I wish they would simply make the console and the debugger rock solid.

It'd be a bit bigger and heavier, but it would allow safer operation of the fridge. It'd probably need to be lockable for driving, though.

1065117,comment,1062509,1063666,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"Real (inflation-adjusted) wages have declined or stayed static since the 1970s.  Even if college tuition only increased at the rate of inflation, it would still be harder to afford today than it was in the past.<p>Also, Ford workers at that time were making above-average salaries.  They weren't the lower-middle-class to middle-class auto workers of today, they were solidly upper-middle-class.  And 32 days is like 12% of his salary, so it wasn't exactly cheap for him (though far better than the 30-40% we see now).<p>Finally, it's disingenuous to compare 1918 colleges to 2008 colleges.  Two major events really shook up the post-high-school landscape in those 90 years: the GI Bill and Vietnam.  The GI Bill sent like 5 million people to college in the 40s-50s who otherwise couldn't have afforded it.  Then Vietnam made college compulsory for middle-class or upper-middle-class men looking to avoid military service.  Throw in desegregation, affirmative action, and co-education, and it's pretty clear that college went from being the domain of the brilliant and affluent to being open to the majority of Americans who finish high school.  This total structural shift and basic re-definition of college makes pre-70s tuitions irrelevant to today's system.<p>If you want, you can also toss in the degree to which the job market has changed to requiring skilled workers with some form of post-secondary education.  While some of this is likely a result of the education levels of the labor-supply, at least part of it is due to our changing industrial and commercial landscape.",1264006282

In this case, if the question is ""what's the best way to pay for my daughter going to an Ivy"" and not ""how on earth can we afford this"", they're not middle-class.  If mortgage is the topic and ""how are we going to ever pay this off"" isn't the question, you're not lower-class.<p>I'll certainly agree that the lines are far from clear-cut, but I think it's best defined in a problem-oriented manner.  The middle class gets these tax breaks because they can't otherwise afford to send their kids to good schools or own houses, while the upper-class can.  They're facing different problems, and so the solutions are tailored differently for them.  This causes confusion when you have income-to-SoL disparities in the country ($60k goes further in Kansas than in NYC), so people at different income levels can be facing the same problems.",1264003834

1064993,comment,1064622,1064860,0,0,masak,,,"Oh, believe me, constructs in Perl (both Perl 5 and Perl 6) mean different things depending on context, too. :)<p>As a simple example, which you'll find in various languages, not just Perl: brackets ('[ ]') construct list objects when standing alone, but when they occur after something, they do array indexing into that thing. This all falls out naturally, and humans are very well equipped at switching between this type of contexts.<p>The Perl 5 behaviour of overloading 'reverse' with double meaning could be said to be context-dependent in this way. But the flip/reverse/invert distinction goes in the other direction, saying ""hey, maybe we do want to keep these three concepts separate rather than crowding them all into the same method"".<p>A similar thing has happened with 'length'. In Perl 5, 'length' always meant 'number of characters in the supplied string', but newbies kept expecting the function to work for lists too. It doesn't. In Perl 6, there's a method '.elems' for lists and '.chars' for strings. Neither of them are accessible as 'length'.<p>In a lot of places where Perl 5 overloads words and depends on context for the right semantics, Perl 6 strives to make things consistent and eliminate mental lists of things you have to remember.",1264003782

I would go so far as to state that it is a gradient, where land masses like the middle east are somewhere in between.

This president is pretty open about it.<p>> What we do know for sure is that he's a pretty good manager,<p>Our president not. He has grade 3 and is just seen as a populist.<p>> The biggest problem I think is a bit different. I'm very very scared by the politicization of public institutions. Top management is always chosen based on party, and automatically so is middle management. This breeds a brand of bureaucracy interesting more in politics than in getting things done, and the more it lasts the lower the mindset seeps.<p>This is extremely similar. In my country it is called “cadre deployment” and is an official position. The ruling party employ their members (cadres) at all public institutions to follow the ruling party’s will. This includes but is not limited to all branches of national, provincial and local government, including places such as hospitals and government owned companies (such as electricity utilities).<p>So, these people are employed on the basis of where they are in the ruling party – and not based on competence. They then also ensure that the whole institution is politicised.<p>---<p>There are two other things, which I do not know if it happens in Romania. The first is an extremely well politically connected oligarchy which are members of the ruling party. They get government contracts (and are favoured by government policy) while they give money to the ruling party and members. Does this happen there?<p>Another thing we have is the ruling party’s “investment arm” (Chancellor house) which holds stake in many tenders given by government. (The government therefore give tenders indirectly to the ruling party).",1264003421

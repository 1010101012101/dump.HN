Andy Hertzfeld created an amazing product, but then Google worked their ""magic"" just like they did with Blogger and watered down every strong feature like circles.<p>The problem at the end of the day is that Google just doesn't understand ""normal people"". If you read up on their corporate culture they're filled with former gifted Montessori kids who make amazing engineers, but the dark side is that they may have a low social IQ. In fact Google goes out of its way to not have to interface with people: Have a problem with a Google product? Well good luck if you want to talk to a human.<p>So yes Google+ has amazing potential; but not with the Google management team. I'm sure over time if they're lucky they can turn it into Pepsi to Facebook's Coke -- but that's only if they figure out how to focus. And if you want to see their latest failure just try using their mobile app: When put next to Facebook it's terrible, and when put next to Instagram (now owned by facebook) it looks like student project.<p>And I say this as someone who loves and uses G+ every day!!!",1349563934

If in my judgement there's currently nothing good on the market that I can invest into, why should I be paying the price? I don't quite understand. If you want my money, make something I want to buy/invest into. Inflation forces me to spend money on things I otherwise would not buy. Thus, it promotes goods and services that are not quite as good.<p>Also, I don't understand why do you consider hoarding a bad thing? If you agree that I honestly earned the money, than you should also agree that I am free to do with them whatever the hell I want. Currencies controlled by governments tax me with inflation, bitcoin doesn't (or at least, it's predictable, open and not controlled by one organization).<p>Upd: attaching additional costs (because there are other costs that are inherent to hoarding, like lost opportunity costs) is, in my view, forcing.

This also works great for small sites, or sites where you don't really care too much about optimizing for mobile - you just want something that looks decent and works with minimal extra effort. But in the long term if the site is rather large, (in my experience) it'd be better to consider building a different app for your mobile version.

They may or may not always exist in the future, but now we have something new: countries which borders do not match the ethnic boundaries- the advantage is that citizens are not so strongly bound to a national identity, and thus can start pitting countries against each others.<p>There is competition between countries for skills. If you are talented and not lucky to have been born in a rich country, you can decide whether to immigrate to Canada, Australia, Germany (etc.) - this is a market.<p>If you have a european passport, with Shengen rules you freely decided where you are doing to work. Just look at where the talented greeks and spaniards go.<p>The island scenarios is more like offering people the choice between a german-run island or a greek-run island, each voting with their feet. Sure there still is a cost of having a government, but it's going down, and will go down as fast as new choices are offered.<p>Identification to nation-states was a limiting factor in the past, but there also seemed seemed to be some kind of network effect where it was harder to be a small country, as it there was some kind of cost (the higher risk of being invaded?)<p>Now look at Luxembourg and Singapore - it seems than being smaller is no longer a disadvantage.<p>Something is changing.",1349562914

4621965,story,,,1,1,Inexib,"Apparel by Karma - Clothing with Purpose",,"Hey there guys. I'm going to make this post extremely simple and quick so I don't waste anyone's time. I have recently started a clothing line by the name of Apparel by Karma, which combines quality designer merchandise with reasonable pricing. We are actually geared to appeal to gamers for the most part, although anyone from any walk of life should be able to buy and enjoy our clothing, AND know that they are helping a good cause.<p>Apparel by Karma donates 5% of all profit each month to a different charity, whether it be for cancer research or for underprivileged kids. We also want to make sure that you get great looking merchandise without happening to spend an arm and a leg for it.<p>Lets take a step back for a second, backtrack about 10 months ago. My grandmother was diagnosed with something similar to brain cancer, and I almost truly felt the cold brush of death for the first time. Thanks to a few different charity organizations and some medical help, she is now doing much better, although it won't last forever. The reason this was able to happen was because of a YouTube video I made, and a cry of help that I made at a desperate time in my life.<p>The point is, charity changed my life, and since then I have been working hard to make a difference in the world myself. I'm posting on here simply because starting a new business is not an easy thing, especially when you're just a row-boat in the big ocean. In addition, being focused around charity makes it a little tougher to expand, which isn't discouraging for me at all. Life is nothing without a challenge.<p>Anyways, in an effort to get a step ahead and make Apparel by Karma successful, I am having a like/share contest on our Facebook page. It may not seem like much, but I have a feeling with the right amount of support I can really fulfill the goal I have. And I would really, really appreciate both your support and your input, guys.<p>www.facebook.com/apparelbykarma",1349562803

Both have covers, both have words, both convey concepts, the purpose of the books is completely different.  As such, the methodology for writing the book is different.  There might even be some commonalities between the two.  You might do fact checking between the two... but the facts matter a lot more in a textbook, then a novel.  While you actually can use the same process a group of professors use to develop a textbook to write your novel, it doesn't make sense to use the same process a novel writer might use to develop a textbook.

It's working really wellinitially I was intimidated about the chips because of a few of the constraints the chip has in order to be as good as it is.  Three challenges:<p>1) Figuring out how to work within the very low (but reasonable) amount of RAM each core has.  They're independent computers, so each core needs to store its code and its data, all within 64 18-bit bytewords, which roughly corresponds to a tweet of information if you tweeted in UTF-8.<p>2) Dealing with the IDE:  the IDE is attacking a problem nobody's solved: parallel compilation.  That being said, it has been the second greatest challenge so far, after<p>3) Getting the hardware set up.  My co-project-doer is light-years ahead of me in the EE department and makes most of the EE decisions, with some input from me about what capabilities the chip needs to have (a minimum amount of off-die RAM, say).  Sourcing parts is something I would not have been able to do on my own, so I'd say this project requires a good deal of electronic literacy, if not dexterity.<p>That being said, though it's a bit of a prima-donna, it has every right and reason to be.  It's an amazing, amazing chip.  It's fast, powerful, unclocked, can work with all kinds of devices, is a crazy bargain both in hardware cost and in energy cost, and best of all, for me at least, an endless source of fun, hard problems.  It's a fascinating chip.",1349561093

(the well-being of the society is taken back, of course, but economy itself, i.e levels of employment and development rise, because forces before non utilized (unemployed people, savings, etc) have to be utilized. And the disturbed status quo brings up opportunities for growth in areas stifled before by established players.<p>><i>Please read up on the ""broken window fallacy.""</i><p>I'm not making the same argument.<p>With a good such as an e-book, if you could read it and then re-sale it, then there would just be one copy sold by the parent company. If it could be resold even more, then from one original buyer you could get 10 meta-buyers, all of them not giving a penny to the author.<p>(And those are not pirates, in which case you wouldn't know if they would have bought it if they couldn't get it for free. Those are actual buyers).<p>So, in essence, the author loses 1/average_resales. That might be good for other companies and the economy in general (as per the ""broken window fallacy""), but it's not for the PARTICULAR industry under discussion.<p>Heck, the author might be financially forced to give up writing altogether, all the while enough people to sustain him _enjoy_ and _pay_ for his book.",1349560970

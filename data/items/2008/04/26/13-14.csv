Cost of living fairly low ($10k/yr reasonable living burn rate), Buenos Aires one of the world's largest metropolitan areas. Burgeoning expatriate population (pro or con, depending).<p>Cons: Distance from family and friends (but some have said they'd love to visit!). Distance from established networks. Virtual business dealings. You need to learn another language to effectively be part of the community (not a programming one, a real language, Spanish and maybe their local hybrid).",1209218082

Writers and artists aren't quite as into the open source stuff yet, so it makes sense that there aren't a lot of open source games.  But the engine stuff <i>has</i> been done, and the open source games that do exist have interesting engines.  Quake, for example.",1209216161
174314,comment,174101,174260,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""The biggest problem with hiring foreign contractors is not that they're foreign, but that the mindset required to hire them cannot attract good hackers. More specifically, the kind of people who decide to save money on development by hiring offshore contractors are usually the kind of people who think programmers are interchangeable parts and can't tell the difference between a good and bad developer.""<p>As someone who lives and works in Bangalore, India, I can confirm this.\nGreat programmers in Ruby (or any other language) are just as rare here as anywhere else.<p>They have a distinct aversion to these ""we have done the core  work now you clean up / tweak the code at 20$/hr"" offers. Someone who is really good at programming can work at google/yahoo/amazon or found a startup. Why should she  work at 20 $ / hr for clowns like the author of this post?<p>""But even if you are a hacker yourself and a good judge of programming talent, it's very hard for you to find good people when you are in a different continent. Think about how difficult it is to attract good talent right here in America. Even if you're in an area with a comparatively high concentration of talented programmers (let's say Silicon Valley), you will probably not find the best people by waiting for them to come to you. You have to get into the right circles, or get referrals from people you trust, or go to meetups like Startup School that attract the kind of people you want, etc. etc. Now what if you were thousands of miles away?""<p>This is exactly true. The <i>only</i> way to find good hackers in India (or Argentina for that matter) is to know good people on the ground <i>before</i> you start your search. And how many people in the United States are in a position to do that?<p>Here is a hint for people who insist on hiring offshore resources ""blind"". Ask for evidence of open source projects or contributions. This immediately eliminates the riffraff who swarm during a boom (and the software industry is booming in Bangalore). <i>Every</i> decent programmer I know in Bangalore has or contributes to an open source project.<p>Ask to see a blog so you can judge written communication skills. Every good programmer I know has a blog.<p>Once you've done all this, make sure you have interesting work to offer. When you outsource garbage work you get roaches. Why are you surprised at this?<p>My 2 rupees.",1209216103

I'm not sure how we're going to make it work, but I think on advantage may be that if he gets venture capital in the UK it's worth ~twice as much if I spend it here.",1209215948
174312,comment,174101,174276,0,0,Hexstream,,,"?!... french is actually my first language. I understand what you're saying, but I seriously always pictured ""en venir à"" as going to somewhere from the perspective of the person that's moving, never as someone coming from somewhere from the perspective of the... goal? This is confusing...<p>edit: I think I understand why I picture them as opposite idioms: ""I see where you're coming from"" seems to refer to the past, like for example if you ask someone from where he's (litterally) coming from (ex: what country?), you're asking where he was before. Whereas ""je vois où tu veux en venir"" seems to refer to the future, you're talking about where he wants to be... See what I'm saying?",1209215872

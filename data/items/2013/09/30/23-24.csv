I disagree that it&#x27;s not the most important one.<p>You can audit a multithreaded open source program much more easily than you can audit a single-threaded closed source program. Merely compiling it adds more obfuscation than making it needlessly, complicated will, and making it needlessly complicated will immediately raise red flags.<p>You don&#x27;t need to analyze an open-source program to see that it&#x27;s been obfuscated, and, if it claims to do anything that requires security, that would probably be enough to make you suspicious.<p>My ultimate point is that compiling is a form of obfuscation that has <i>extreme</i> plausible deniability. There&#x27;s no form of obfuscation that will complicate the code of an open source program as much as compiling it will, while still looking as innocuous as compiling does.",1380585512

Even aside from the free will debate, this is completely untrue. Our behavior is motivated by a combination of unconscious impulses and consciously directed goals. If the unconscious impulses to steal became great enough it would override any rational ideals about property rights and such.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll retort that there are millions of poor folks that don&#x27;t steal so I couldn&#x27;t possibly be right. Well that&#x27;s true, but how many of them are kept in line by external factors such as potential jail time, shame, embarrassment, fear, etc? This is the point of society after all--create external motivations for behaviors that are beneficial to the group. All those that don&#x27;t steal is not an indication that they do it for purely rational reasons.<p>The point is that asking &quot;would you seriously consider robbery&quot; to someone who is relatively well off is not a meaningful question, just like you saying (from your place of privilege) that you would never consider violating someone else&#x27;s property rights no matter how destitute you became is a meaningless declaration.",1380585403

I can&#x27;t stand the many series and movies he&#x27;s made.<p>Did not like Lost, I tried to watch a couple episodes of Fringe, I just hated it. It was bland, boring and feels so calculated. And Star Trek was a great example on how Hollywood movies are made nowadays, piece together a buncha action scenes and hope the story makes sense(I&#x27;m looking at your Iron Man 3).<p>Now I say this because I am not that big of a fan of Star Trek, I really liked TNG, Voyager and Enterprise, but I barely know anything about Star Trek(haven&#x27;t even watched TOS) like many people do. But this man claimed on TV that he didn&#x27;t like Star Trek, how on Earth can you expect someone to even understand it well enough to make a half decent movie.

Her name was Michaels, and if you search hard enough, you can still find her Usenet posts on Google Groups. We lived on opposite sides of the world, but we kept in touch for over 2 or so years. Then she moved out of home, had no internet access and we list touch. One of the worst days of my life was the 10th anniversary of Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death. Not because it was the day he passed on, but because of what I found. I tried to look her up. I felt she must have found the internet again. It had been some years since my last search. Sadly I discovered that I was never going to get a chance to speak with her ever again, because she had died in 2001, 3 years earlier. I managed to speak to her family, and her father told me that he had often wondered what had become of me. It&#x27;s still hard to deal with.

6472942,comment,6468295,6468295,1,0,keerthiko,,,"I loosely consider myself a self-taught programmer:<p>1) \na)My middle school (~2000) used to have a computer co-curricular course. I learned some BASIC, some HTML, and made websites/applets that trolled the user (the cancel button that runs away, icons and buttons that didn&#x27;t do what they said, hidden buttons and urls via formatting, etc). Turns out I studied UX anti-patterns via trolling.<p>b) When I was 13 (~2002), my brother was studying Computer Science for his Indian CBSE 11th grade concentration. I bugged him incessantly about what he was writing, helped him debug, tried to come up with better ideas and algorithms for what he was writing. He was torn between enjoying teaching me stuff and getting my help, and feeling inferior if I actually came up with a better idea than him. Regardless, he was vital to me becoming as much of a hacker as I am today, because he was an excellent teacher, constantly challenging me and giving me interesting things to think about without making me do mindnumbingly boring tasks. While being taught is not really self-taught, that I seeked to learn it without any external motivating factors and purely out of interest, and I just capitalized on the nearest and most effective resource available to me I think makes it close enough. This is probably the answer to (2), by the way.<p>c) I followed in my brother&#x27;s footsteps (2005), but I already knew the material, having been progressing through it on my own in my spare time in the interim. Taking the course just meant I could dedicate that much of my &quot;not free time&quot; to doing something I intended to learn! I skipped most of the homework, got mediocre grades, didn&#x27;t know the algorithms asked on the exams, but enjoyed being vindicated in sitting in front of the monitor staring at code, making my first Tank game, a hangman game, a file encryption/decryption system, etc, all in C++.<p>d) I started pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the hands-on school Olin College in Greater Boston, where I was encouraged to learn to <i>do</i>, and less about <i>theory</i>. This is where I really stopped learning computer science, and really started teaching myself programming. I hated CompSci more with every class, and at some point found myself writing way more code the semesters I had no CompSci credits, because I was enjoying it so much more programming controllers for electromechanical projects to do cool things, than learning how Turing Machines and Regular Expressions flip things on and off.<p>3) I had no real opportunities to work internships in the Middle East where I grew up, the industry was very young and elitist where it existed there. And I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get numbed to professional programming work there. I worked as a tools developer for an electrical engineering lab where I also did research for a couple summers. I then went on to work at IBM for an internship (2010) and discovered it was a pit of doom for someone like me who could see it &quot;being pretty alright,&quot; but never feel fulfilled being a cog in someone else&#x27;s machine that I didn&#x27;t care about. There was nothing wrong with the work, but I&#x27;m glad it was just an internship. I made something I was proud of, some bigwigs clapped when I presented it, they shook my hand, asked me questions like they were interested, genuinely made it sound like they would use it in a product at some point (I stopped checking a year ago), and I was on a tiny high in my first professional dev job.\nI fled from corporate software dev, and now live poverty stricken in the Bay Area making (about 50% of) something really exciting, with people I&#x27;m excited to see everyday to work with.<p>I think at some level anyone who pursues programming to fulfill their dreams is self-taught. School does not teach you how to make the things you really care about making, but it can help you a bit.",1380582232

This not only stalled improvements to SVG 1.1 but created a situation where the editing software (e.g. Inkscape) allows the user to create files using SVG 1.2 features which are invalid in SVG 1.1.<p>The abandonment has resulted in much-needed improvements to SVG being delayed. The last full release of SVG was 1.1 which was in 2003, we won&#x27;t see another full release until SVG 2 which is expected in 2014, over a decade later!<p>Never mind the fact the browser implementations of SVG are still <i>riddled</i> with bugs and none are complete.",1380582180

The web is supposed to be fluid, ads and other content should be encouraged to be percentage-width based, or at least responsive to different screen sizes and layouts.

Why not focus on accumulating knowledge instead? 99% of the questions have been answered before, and are basically repetitions. Find a way to dynamically learn answers to common problems that customers have based on previous calls and serve them to new callers. This isn't easy of course, but I think it can be done. And there's a $280 billion market waiting to buy...",1210298066

185127,comment,182020,182020,0,0,akkartik,,,"Most interesting. A related insight: people will often not think much about what they pay in a social context, but be brutally penny-wise in non-social contexts.<p>This explains why restaurants can have huge margins, but coffee shops rarely do. It's normal to see people working alone at a coffee shop for hours after paying $1.99 for a coffee. Such behavior is uncommon in a restaurant -- the common script is to go out with friends or on dates to eat socially. A restaurant can charge more for ambience and service. $$$$ coffee shops on yelp are at the level of Starbucks.",1210297984

I recommend travel, but taking time off is not necessarily a panacea. In particular, be realistic about how much money you have and will spend. Otherwise, when you come back you have to scramble to find a job, which isn't an optimal position. In retrospect, the time could have been better spent figuring out a startup of my own.",1210297684
185124,story,,,9,15,cao825,"Ask YC: Does anyone know of any good Cobol tutorials?",,"Okay, well I am graduating from college as a Computer Science major and we were taught the usual C++, Java, etc... but obviously we never got much into the ancient languages. However, the job I got is part of a team converting a companies' applications from COBOL to Java. So, I would like to learn as much COBOL as possible in 2 weeks. Does anyone know of any good tutorials out there that can teach such an outdated language?  Note that I have googled for some and got some okay results, but nothing that looks particularly wonderful for learning business level COBOL.<p>Also, if anyone else has been in a similar situation, I would be very interested to hear about your experiences.<p>Thank you!",1210297671

185111,comment,183535,184154,0,0,mixmax,,,"Since fallentimes just asked the same in an e-mail I can copy paste it here :-)<p>Basically it’s an advertising display. The way it works is that you have a motor with an attached circuitboard that has a row of RGB LED’s attached in a line from the center and out. When you spin the circuitboard and modulate the LED’s in the right fashion you can create the illusion of a display that’s hanging in midair. This is pretty computationally intensive for an embedded application (72 RGB LED’s that each need to update roughly 5000 times a second) so we used FPGA’s for it.  The whole contraption has a built-in GSM phone module, and can communicate with a central server. The idea is that you take the display to a bar or some other outlet and plug it in. It will then automatically call in to the central server and request updates. Each display has a unique ID and thus it is possible to create content and advertising for individual displays, or groups of displays. If for instance you want to advertise in a certain part of town you can buy advertising time on only displays in the part of town you’re interested in. There’s a webbased tool for doing this.",1210296117

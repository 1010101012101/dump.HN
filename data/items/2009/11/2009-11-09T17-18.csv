931374,comment,930992,931298,0,0,camccann,,,"pg is completely correct regarding ""principled"" arguments against software patents. There's no consistent way to assert ""temporary property rights to ideas about physical devices are fine, but owning ideas about math is morally wrong"".<p>If you (quite sensibly) throw out the obfuscating language about morality and property rights, however, it's certainly possible to assert ""temporary, government-enforced monopolies on ideas of this type will encourage innovation, but government-granted monopolies on ideas of that other type will hinder progress and encourage misuse"". This is a statement of factual nature, that may be correct or incorrect, but is not logically inconsistent. It also makes it more obvious that patents, despite being called ""IP"", are not actually about property at all--they're a regulatory hack, the government deliberately distorting the market with the goal of subsidizing particular behaviors, namely innovation and invention.",1257789504

I think they were a great idea for a time when a product could be easily taken apart and reimplemented based on looking at its physical components.

It's really quite remarkable... within <i>maybe</i> ten blocks of the (surprisingly nice) Renaissance Center and re-developed waterfront area, there were entire city blocks that were completely overgrown with ivy and other such plants. It felt like I was inside the pages of ""The World Without Us"". I can totally see the urban agriculture thing working out in Detroit, except for the industrial contamination problem.<p>Of course, what <i>really</i> struck me was the abrupt transition we saw driving to the north and east along Jefferson Ave. For block after block, it's nothing but abandoned factories, vacant lots, and eerily empty and overgrown neighborhoods, with the only operational (i.e., not boarded up) businesses being convenience stores and the occasional bait shop. Then, all of a sudden, without any transition, the scenery changes to a ritzy suburb. I swear, it was a sharp enough contrast that my mind was reeling from psychic whiplash for the rest of the day.<p>It was like the NYC good-block/bad-block phenomenon, only on a massive geographic scale and with the volume turned up to 11.",1257789443

Those teachers recognized my interest and feed me more advanced material while I was with them, but when I had taken the only classes available without those math prerequisites, we parted ways.<p>After graduating H.S. I took to writing excessively intricate batch scripts on my family's XT, and later while working on a help desk I checked out this new ""HTML"" and ""JavaScript"" stuff by way of WebMonkey tutorials and free hosting on a new service called GeoCities.<p>Years later, with ASP/VBscript, PHP, and bash experience all from after-hours activities I transitions from systems support and administration to programming as my career, after which my experience and expertise has mushroomed.<p>I couldn't have come all this way without the resources of the Web to back me up.",1257788970

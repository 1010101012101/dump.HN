First: The vast majority of mobile data is video, audio, images, and application updates. Second: When sent over the wire, JSON and XML are typically compressed with gzip or deflate.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget: JSON and XML have some significant advantages over most other serialization formats. They&#x27;re ubiquitous. Practically every programming language has libraries to parse and generate them. Practically every programmer knows how to work with them. They&#x27;re human-readable. No special programs are needed to view their contents.<p>In other words, JSON and XML are only &quot;wasteful&quot; if you don&#x27;t count developer time.

I sped up an app (major software from major large corporation) by a factor of 10x a few years back by removing GUI updates. What you have to do is create a thread that refreshes the GUI periodically and not let your main worker thread ever work on the GUI. This particular app was an Eclipse Plugin (a source control app) and the Eclipse SWT to update the console log window was being called after every file operation (of which there were 10s of thousands). All I did was move the GUI refreshing into it&#x27;s own thread, and call it only every 250millis or so.

Instead they include 3 bits to tell you what length-scheme is used, and some other bits (variable number of bits, because varint) to tell you which field in the schema will tell you the rest of the datatype for this field (as well as the key-name of the field).<p>Protobuf is a rich protocol for doing potentially-complicated things.

See this HN post that gave me the encouragement to keep going (thanks HN!) - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6059481"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6059481</a>.<p>2. I wrote the original agent in python 2.6. It was great because I could use things like python-requests (which was awesome!). However my first encounter with an  enterprise customer showed me that was not feasible because they were running only python 2.4 and would not be upgrading for another 2 years.<p>3. I had the choice of either not getting the customer or back porting the code to Python 2.4. I chose to back port the code to python 2.4 and get the customer. This was a lot of work but worth it because I was able to then raise a round with a16z. - <a href=""https://www.distelli.com/blog/distelli-series-a-funding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.distelli.com/blog/distelli-series-a-funding</a><p>4. When Brian joined Distelli, he actually worked on the Python code for many months and made many improvements and added many features. When it was time to add the streaming logs feature he built the prototype in Lua just to prove that the idea would work and then we talked extensively to figure the direction we should go in.<p>5. We decided to move to Lua because Brian was very familiar with it and it was a lightweight language and we could ship a single download with zero dependencies. We also looked at using Go. At the end of the day the decision was Brian&#x27;s to make and own as the senior engineer on the project. The passage of time has convinced me that was the right decision.<p>I&#x27;m sure we could have stayed with Python with all the suggestions on this page, but we decided to go with Lua. It was a good fit for what we needed and honestly I felt that my original code was not in great shape and would need a lot of work to refactor and a rewrite felt like the right decision at the time. Looking back I still think it was the right decision and I&#x27;m very happy with the end result.<p>edit: grammar",1453854080

Letting prospective buyers test-drive apps,  upgrade pricing, and better discovery come to mind. I have both a Mini and a Pro with Pencil and I <i>love</i> the hardware. The software is the problem though. Few apps make use of all the possibilities; existing apps will also have to be (re)written and possibly reconceived for the different form factors. It&#x27;s a good sign that Phil Schiller is overseeing the app stores now, hopefully something will change this year.<p>Re: iPhone<p>Here, the obvious thing to do seems to produce a new 5S-sized model. 60 percent of 5S or older install base have not upgraded? Maybe there is a reason… Also, they could always try to go &quot;down-market&quot; and produce a greater variety like with the iPod to take further share from Google. I don&#x27;t see the end of growth in this market, by far.<p>Re: currency effect<p>True, stronger dollar affects revenue or unit sales (where prices have been adapted) <i>relative to previous years</i>. But one could also argue that the years 2009-2014 were special in that the US weakened the dollar through QE, and perhaps Apple (and other US companies) enjoyed &quot;backwinds&quot; then rather than &quot;headwinds&quot; now. It looks whiny to me to say &quot;look ma, 100 then is only 85 now&quot;. As someone said, &quot;if my aunt had balls, she&#x27;d be my uncle&quot;.

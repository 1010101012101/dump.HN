They've gotten too greedy in just choosing the most ideal cookie-cutter groups that follow their rigid profile of the ideal founders.<p>It just always seemed that YC had a bigger vision than making lots of cash. No longer.<p>This is not unique to YC, many successful people admit later in their careers that they would never, today, hire themselves. I just wonder if YC will continue down this path  or reach a point where they will turn around, stop trying desperately to prove themselves and make a more meaningful difference.",1201967945

108373,comment,107683,108335,0,0,airhadoken,,,"True that infix < doesn't appear right after parens, but in the minds of most people, there isn't really a notion of ""infix"" as an entity unto itself.  The alligator just eats the bigger fish.<p>Really, the problem is that a small amount of whitespace can change the meaning of the code.<p>(< 1 2) => #t<p>(<1 2) => #f<p>...for a convenience function <1 that semantically means ""is less than 1"".  Maybe you wouldn't define such a function, but having to think about it at all or having to mentally redefine < somewhat validates the idea that the syntax here is a stumbling point.",1201967717

Publish or perish time for me!<p>So after my hangover wore off (we went out last night), I decided that I shouldn't be such a grouch and I should take a gander at arc rather than just shoot my mouth off about how I don't want to dick around with my near 20k lines of CLISP code (wc #of lines, which include comments).<p>I looked very quickly at the tutorial and I have to say that I very much like the feel. And although I am under strict personal orders not to think about code these days, I can't help but to plot out a potential porting path. The first thing will be to build some macros so that my common lisp code looks more arc like. This would force me to clean a lot of things too, perhaps knocking it down to 10k if I am lucky. I also know I am doing a lot of dumb things here and there so perhaps if I am really lucky/skilled I can get it down to 5k.<p>Then I will see how things evolve and do the port when I get the time. It looks like arc will have good momentum and will breath life into the community, so yes I think it's a great thing.",1201967511

'celebrities' try to convince each other how <i>un</i>important Arc is, but nevertheless they literally spend hours and hours writing their comments about it...<p>(At least they help to push the interest in Lisp generally.)",1201967457

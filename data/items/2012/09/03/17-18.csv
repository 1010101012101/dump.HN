In this case, the psychologist can only decry what men aren't doing (having ""meaningful"" relationships) but has no idea what they <i>are</i> doing (engaging with science and technology), because that territory is incomprehensible to a psychologist.<p>As with most such psychological hypotheses, this is a first-class disservice to women -- it implies that women who forgo science and technology in favor of ""meaningful relationships"" are making the right choice.<p>The article claims about men that they are ""... outperformed by girls 'at every level,' ... "". Not really -- the science and technology gap is real enough, it represents a serious obstacle to social progress and gender equality, and it has no right to exist. But as to why it exists, that's easier to explain -- airhead psychologists telling women who avoid difficult subjects that they're making the right choice.",1346695189

4471222,comment,4470055,4471112,3,0,DougWebb,,,"I hear you, but I can't agree. Maybe it's my background. For 13 years as a professional developer my primary languages were Perl and Javascript, using Vim and the Unix command-line as my IDE. For the past 1.5 years I've swapped C# for Perl and Visual Studio for my IDE (still have a vi emulator though.) Intellisense is definitely useful, but I find it gets in the way a lot... both literally by overlapping the code around the code I'm typing, and figuratively by trying to insert text while I type which causes me to double-type characters and backspace a lot. It does help with remembering (not learning) APIs, but that's one of my concerns about translating to js: Intellisense won't know which APIs are usable and which ones are not. If you're a C# developer who's dependent on Intellisense, it's going to mislead you here.<p>Regarding refactoring, it's hardly worry free for me. I always have to double check what VS is going to do when I use its refactoring tools, because sometimes it makes a significant mistake. Now, that's often caused by the way I wrote some code and I have to fix it up as part of my refactoring, but I would have discovered that while refactoring manually too, and if I trusted VS I wouldn't have discovered it at all. So VS helps a bit with the typing, but it's not much faster than I'd be without it. A lot of that is probably because I learned to refactor using vim, grep, sed, and other Unix command-line tools, so I have no problem doing large-scale refactoring changes touching thousands of lines over a 100k+ line codebase. Extracting a method is childs play in comparison, and I don't mind the extra few seconds it takes to do it manually exactly the way I want it.<p>There is definitely a need for better javascript editing tools. VS, with the right plugins, wouldn't be bad, but I'm not sure Intellisense can really cut it. When I'm putting some code into an MVC template or js file and I want to refer to a jQuery plugin I know is loaded by my layout template, there is no way for Intellisense to know about that plugin or its API, so it can't help me. In contrast if I load my app in Firefox and use Firebug's console and debugger, I can type in some code and it's able to show me the API in real-time because it's reflecting the live javascript objects as I type. That's the kind of intellisense I want.",1346695153

I use a js generator language (not this one, I don't want to shift attention), and it does ""nice"" things that would be a pain for me to do manually... like setting up namespaces for code, spacing everything perfectly.  Even if the output is not to your taste, at least you know that the style will be 100% consistent in style and implementation. I never have problems debugging.<p>The other argument is that ""the generated code is complex/ugly"".  Unfortunately, ""fast"" code is often ugly.  Static compilers can do some optimizations by default (e.g. optimized for loops), and you only need to worry about the ""pretty"" code at the higher level of abstraction. I doubt you will ever have to debug one of these optimizations, any decent compiler should get them right.

Just specify any desired vim plugin github repos in your vimrc and let the :BundleInstall, :BundleClean etc commands do the rest.<p>I used the standard plugins for most of the stated objectives, but there are places where I found some tricks. The coolest trick is running external programs without locking vim. You can send commands and selections to a tmux terminal using Vimux:\n  <a href=""https://github.com/benmills/vimux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benmills/vimux</a>\nAfter wrangling with running vim under tmux, I discovered that the vimux plugin works in MacVim too when tmux is running alongside.<p>The thing I run most often is tests. In Rubyland people advise using Guard, which runs tests automatically when test files change. However this goes against my ""don't do things behind my back"" philosophy. Vim-turbux is more my taste. It extends vimux to run cucumber and rspec tests with the press of a key: <a href=""https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jgdavey/vim-turbux</a><p>The next area where most megadotfile presets are lacking is finding the uses of code. Finding code definition is pretty well handled by exuberant-ctags and vim-rails, but finding code uses is trickier. The cscope utility does this, but its language support is limited from what I could tell. Another contender is GNU global. Its setup is...interesting:\n  <a href=""http://simple-and-basic.com/2008/10/using-rtags-ang-gtags-for-coding-ruby.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simple-and-basic.com/2008/10/using-rtags-ang-gtags-fo...</a>\nI couldn't get it working and the GTAGS files it generates cluttered my repos. I cheated and just mapped a key to do :Ggrep (git-fugitive) on the current word. While cscope or global would give the finest results, a massive grep comes close.

Depending on your audience, be prepared to ""present"" your skills in an appropriate way. For people who may not be your direct client but will be acting as the courrier of your message, keep it simple  you probably won't get the business because of what you say to them but because of how they know you out of context from business.<p>The second important part is to give your clients a great service experience.

Investing is not my area of specialization and I want to enjoy a high quality of life.  I take advantage of division of labor to monetize what I do best--software development.<p>In a past life, I read many books on investing, primarily Jack Schwager's Market Wizards and my personal favorite, Reminisces of a Stock Operator.  There's a lot of interesting stuff about the markets--game theory, behavioral finance--but unless you're going to spend a lot of time on it, the markets can be approximated as casinos for which you do not have an edge.  Best to put your money in small and mid-cap index funds.<p>Similarly, most consumer real estate investments take a lot of time to manage (rental properties), so I've focused on my home, something which I would have to maintain anyway.  In this climate you can get a loan so cheap you're best off putting as little down as possible and investing the rest.  But you may want to buy a house within the next year or so as a hedge against inflation and to take advantage of the unholy combination of low interest rates and a relatively cheap housing market.  If the Euro cracks or the Fed ends up printing money, we may find ourselves in an inflationary environment.  If you have a fixed rate loan, you're golden--your income will rise with inflation, but your monthly payments will not, cheapening your debts.<p>Overall, my advice is to focus on setting up some compounding investments very early in life.  Many people dabble in all kinds of things, like entrepreneurship, as a youth because they're fun.  It's important to have hobbies, but for things that really matter, you can't afford to fool around.  For example, I could join Y Combinator straight out of school and spend two years at a startup eating Ramen, or I could join Google and eat Ramen.  If I did the latter, I'd have $50K in my 401Ks and up to $150K in other investments.  Invested wisely, proceeds from those two years will give you $4M of today's dollars at retirement, even if you don't invest another penny--a nice safety net which will allow you to do riskier things later on in life.  Entrepreneurship is a lottery ticket which is likely to fail.  There are only so many good businesses (born of confluences of macro trends) out there, and it's hard to be in the right place at the right time.  You could try to get lucky and end up scratching a living out of hardscrabbble, or you could use your talent to rise within the few companies which are actually printing money, and then let your dollars work for you.",1346693640

I'm much more productive and have much less bugs while writing old school, unpopular Java, and using the IDE's (eclipse) sugar features. Scala is now my favorite language (I really hope it was a little more new dev friendly, it can become very syntax overwhelming sometimes) as I can many of the functional features in Ruby / Python / JavaScript / Clojure, but still stay in Static Java land.<p>Another thing static typing gives me that I really wish I had in JavaScript, is (almost) worry free refactoring.<p>In Java, I can extract methods, constants, delegates, change method signatures, rename members, fix typos in code, and never to worry I copy pasted something wrong.<p>I have yet to find such a way to do it safely in JavaScript / CoffeScript or any other dynamically typed language.

This response of mine has already grown too long.<p>You don't have to convince me that mathematics is important--my background is in pure mathematics. I just don't think CS people are hapless fools who need applied math people like you from the outside to help them out. In my book, the non-systems part of CS is already a part of mathematics.<p>Since you bring it up, I've always considered numerical methods as firmly a part of applied mathematics. Combinatorial search and optimization problems are in the heartland of CS. The simplex method straddles numerical optimization and combinatorial optimization and is a bit of a hermaphrodite. Low-dimensional LPs are important in computational geometry and that field has produced some  beautiful algorithms. Here's Seidel's randomized algorithm: Throw out a random hyperplane and solve the smaller problem recursively. If this optimum satisfies the excluded constraint then we are done. Otherwise the true optimum must lie on the hyperplane, so we can reduce the dimension of the problem by 1.<p>> Net, without the math, there is little reason to take the algorithm seriously.<p>An algorithm _is_ mathematics. The reason I said you seemed ignorant of computer science is this apparent belief that computer science is a random bunch of algorithms without any supporting theory.<p>> Well, to take the algorithm seriously, we need more than just the algorithm<p>Your premise is based on a strawman. How do you think algorithms are designed? They aren't generated randomly. They are generated based on exactly the kind of insight that generates theorems and proofs. There may not be tight proofs of every property we'd like to know for certain. That is certainly true for the simplex method! Its worst-case running time is exponential (e.g. Klee-Minty), and there is a small cottage industry devoted to proving its running time is polynomial in the average case (for various definitions of 'average case'). People have been using the simplex method very effectively since its inception despite knowing that its pathological behavior can be very bad indeed. Had you wanted to make your point more effectively, you should have picked interior point methods, which have the additional benefit of working for a much wider class of convex problems like SDPs.<p>>  Claim: If z is bounded above on F, then z achieves its least upper bound. Note: The proof is not just usual analysis with converging sequences from Rudin's 'Principles'.<p>This has nothing to do with linearity or convexity. It's true for any continuous function f : X -> R on a closed subset F of a complete topological space X. If f is bounded above on F then its supremum on F is achieved at some x in X. By the supremum property and continuity of f, you can find a net in F which accumulates around x. This Cauchy net converges to x since X is complete. Because F is closed it contains its own accumulation points. Hence x is in F.<p>This proof is exactly at the level of Baby Rudin if you drop back the generality a bit and work with metric spaces.<p>> For us to take the simplex algorithm seriously, we need to know that this claim is true.<p>Nonsense. Any implementation of the simplex method is already going to introduce round-off error, so the theoretical difference between optimizing on a set and its closure has no practical consequences. If your point is that the achievement of the supremum ensures termination of the simplex method, that is false. The simplex method is hill climbing on a polytope's vertex graph. Whenever there is a local tie between neighboring vertices you need a tie-breaking pivoting rule. Bad pivoting rules (e.g. lexicographic ordering) will lead to cycling and non-termination. In the absence of such local ties, all you need to know to prove termination is that the number of vertices is finite and that the objective function strictly decreases each step. Even the proof of termination when pivoting with Bland's rule is purely combinatorial.<p>An example of something that's actually important in practice is how strong Lagrange duality supplies non-heuristic stopping criteria for convex programs via dual feasible points. That way we know what we're giving up by being suboptimal. Duality theory is also much richer and subtler than the kind of mindless definition-chasing freshman homework problem you bought up above.",1346693030

Gnome-shell gives you a nice list of all your applications and you can switch between categories. The biggest bug since the introduction of Unity besides trying hard to make you remember application names is that F1 no longer opens help. The question mark symbol has also disappeared from the top panel.<p>After grudgingly Googling how to use Unity, I found the steps to list applications and it's absolutely horrible. Here's how:<p><pre><code>  Right-click the Ubuntu logo*\n  Choose applications\n  Click ""Filter results""\n</code></pre>\nThe buttons presented are individual toggle-buttons, not the usual switch buttons. Turn the next category on, turn the previous category off. Madness. And on top of everything that's badly designed, it's also unresponsive. A lot of clicks are missed and this is especially noticeable with the workspace switcher.<p>For now, there's the option of installing gnome-session-fallback. It introduces a ""GNOME classic (no effects)"" option in LightDM which works well and has the old, functional workspace switcher. Still no F1 for help, but it sits under Applications > Accessories so it's relatively discoverable. The panels can be customised by holding down ALT+Super while right-clicking them (thank you again, Google).<p>Sadly, Gnome is deprecating the fallback session in favor of a software rasteriser (""llvmpipe"") to run Gnome-shell where a hardware rasteriser is unavailable. The next release will also see the lock screen moved into the shell so it'll look pretty, but it better be the most stable release they've ever had since the last 2.x.

Quantum effects can be modeled and predicted very precisely, but they're not open to everyday comprehension like macroscopic physics. Niels Bohr once said, ""Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.""<p>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle can be summarized by saying that there is an irreducible level of uncertainty in measuring a particle's position and momentum -- if you increase the momentum measurement accuracy, you sacrifice the position measurement accuracy, and vice versa. To put this in the simplest terms, if you multiply momentum and position accuracy together, the product of the two accuracies cannot be smaller (more precise) than a certain well-defined lower threshold.<p>You can force a greater accuracy of either of the two possible measurements, but only at the expense of the other. In the final analysis, if you measure, say, position with an arbitrarily high degree of accuracy, you sacrifice the ability to measure momentum at all. And vice versa.<p>It's important to say that this fact about measurement at the microscale affects macroscopic measurements as well, but with a progressively lower probability of affecting events, as size and mass increase. To say this in the simplest way, quantum effects are present at all scales, but with a decreased probability of influence as sizes and momenta increase.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle</a>",1346692277

4471024,comment,4470460,4470460,2,0,zmmz,,,"Architect in the making here.<p>I was expecting Graves's article to be some form of luddism judged by the title, but after reading it I assume that it is linkbait that was added by the editors. In fact, I don't see anything overly negative that Graves said. He correctly points out the reality: that there are certain parts of a creative work flow that are not addressed by any software at this moment. CAD has it's place and has made drafting easier, but honestly drafting is not where the value or enjoyment lies in an architect's day-to-day. The term ""CAD monkey"" exists for a reason.<p>There is a very important distinction that Graves points out: referential sketch, preparatory study and definitive drawing. Each of these is very different and has different requirements.<p>I used to dream of something like a unified work flow for this stuff, where you could do everything in one, well integrated (digital) ecosystem. It does not exist, not for architecture, and I suspect it's mainly because an architects requirements at the first stages are almost the inverse of what they are at last stages. Compare the properties of a sketch to construction documents: in the former you don't want any friction and keep things abstract and detached from technical requirements, whereas the latter has to stand up. An analogy would be going from a fashion designer's inspiration board to instructions for making the clothes.<p>The first stages are rough, contradictory, abstract, idiosyncratic. Things that software is not very good at being. I feel that especially the last word on that list is crucial, since there are some people (like me) who don't even draw that much, I much prefer to work with text and more abstract references in the stage that Graves described as ""referential sketch"".<p>CAD has addressed the points where communication standards exist, but nobody brainstorms and researches in the same way so it's difficult to build a tool around that. As an example: another architect, Steven Holl, travels frequently. He does small (A5-ish) watercolours with a pocket set, takes a picture of it with his iPhone and sends it to his studio in NY. His staff knows him enough now to understand them and can use them to develop their projects.",1346691997

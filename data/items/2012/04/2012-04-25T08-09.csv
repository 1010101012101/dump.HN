3888253,comment,3880595,3881229,1,0,entropy_,,,"Well, I've had a pretty similar experience so far. Although, I have to admit, I'm still 24 and less than a year into my first job. However, I feel like I know exactly what you're talking about. It feels to people around me like I always know everything ahead of time and exactly what to do whereas I'm constantly learning and internally it feels like I really don't know what I'm doing. But I'm always confident in my ability to learn and adapt and somehow get things done on time.<p>About 5 months ago I took a freelancing project that was an android tablet app. I had never programmed for android before(and had just a vague idea of what that environment was like). But I took the job anyway and assured them I could get it done in a timely manner. And 5 months later, I did, and I learned the android framework in the process.<p>I also had a similar experience during the summer of my 3rd year in university where I worked on a project for 2.5months where the most challenging part was user interface design. It was also a tablet-based project, but this was 2008, iOS and android had just barely come out and there were no tablet OSs. I used linux + python + pyglet and wrote my own UI toolkit. Likewise, I was out of my depths most of the time as I had never done anything remotely similar but at the same time I was never stressed out and confident I could get it done over the summer, and I did.<p>So I guess your experience isn't anomalous or unique(though probably quite rare). And I know at least another person, a very good friend of mine, who's also had a similar experience.",1335344317

Case in point: NTFS is hardly a ""state of the art"" filesystem: one of the slowest filesystems for workloads reading/writing many small files, 3 years late in delivering TRIM support, no snapshot capabilities like zfs/btrfs, no checksumming of data, probably the last modern desktop file system to support hard links, etc.<p>3.

For instance for me I browse the app store and look at the top say 50 and if I see anything good I get it. But other people must do different things, as them app/games wouldn't be in the top 50 otherwise.<p>As I only have a 16gb iPad, size does influence my purchase. Anything bigger than a couple of hundred mb and I generally don't bother, even if it's a free app. I generally don't read descriptions but do look at screenshots and reviews.<p>The reason for me asking is I have developed my first iOS app but having real trouble marketing it because money is tight. So before I pay for any marketing am trying to find out which way will give me more bang for my buck. Most review sites charge for a review, hence why a app might have great reviews but when you download it, you find it's not that good and end up deleting it.<p>So a few questions if you don't mind -<p>Do you read review sites ?
If you do, do you click on adverts for apps/games or only go for ones that have been reviewed ?<p>If you browse the app store, do you look at description, screenshots, reviews ?
If so which one influences you more ?<p>Does price affect your buying decision ?<p>Does size of download affect your buying decision ?<p>Do you follow anyone on twitter or Facebook for recommendations ?<p>Do you read forums for recommended apps or games ?<p>Thanks,<p>Dave",1335343483

Think Double Fine [1], Harebrained Schemes [2], Order of the Stick [3]. The people behind these projects have a clear, public track record of delivery and the projects wouldn't have happened without Kickstarter's crowdfunding.<p>There is, of course, also Kickstarter original/official goal which is funding art, but here the same principles apply. With the exception that maybe art backers are a little more accepting of late/disappointing rewards at the end.<p>The only real question is, is there a sufficient number of such proven projects to make Kickstarter sustainable?

Anything (pre Rage?) by ID and all the HumbleBundle games.<p>On the other hand, all the pieces are in place: OpenGL support is pretty good and lots of games actually work well enough under wine. That probably means that if they were compiled directly against winelib (as Google did with the Picasa Linux client) they would work just fine. Anything that already runs on OSX is probably an easy port, given some support libraries. That's quite a big chunk of the Steam catalog.<p>I could well imagine that if Valve put some development time into it, they could ship a ""PC"" set top box based around Steam that would be pretty compelling. One obvious roadblock is that they'd promptly attract a pile of patent lawsuits from Microsoft & Sony as those companies tried to protect their existing platforms, but I'd love to see them do it.",1335342105

3888173,comment,3883075,3883075,2,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I see a lot of discussion over the Github comments. I understand the merits of having an account with some code on it, as well as the restrictions of corporations and time that prevent many people from maintaining a repository. However this is a red herring.<p>The problem is visibility.<p>The resume is very poor at showcasing your talents. All the common resume advice makes yours hard to differentiate from everybody else's. While having a website, Github, Bitbucket, or something else will help your case, you are already hobbled by the very generic-ness of the resume format. You can play with the fonts and format, but I've found that it's a fine balance between the ""Pop"" factor and annoying the reader.<p>The other major problem with the resume is they are very low cost in terms of those applying. A unscrupulous candidate can send out hundreds of resumes to shotgun his chances at landing a job. The time it takes to vet out these is many times higher for the hiring party, and it is multiplied by the number of resumes to vet. Companies must then increase the cost of applying, either through coding tests or puzzles, but this paradoxically turns away candidates who might be qualified and don't have the time. This is especially true for small startups who have problems with visibility of their own.<p>To me, the question isn't Github use or having a website, but <i>how can I increase my visibility</i>? Being physically present in front of people who are hiring is so ridiculously powerful, that most hires are made that way. Thus, obviously, meetups/networking/hackathons are a giant step in the right direction, but not everybody is in the correct neighborhood and can't casually attend. For those of us that aren't local, how can we disrupt the email->resume->round-file process that effectively dehumanizes most applicants?<p>I am warming up to short video submissions because of their ability to show the personality and creativity of the individual behind all the credentials. It allows for both a quick introduction, as well as introducing a subtle time cost, on behalf of the applicant and it doesn't add significant (as far as I know) time to the hiring manager.<p>On the other hand, maybe the hiring process is an NP-Hard problem.",1335341718

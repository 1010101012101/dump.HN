While prototyping I typically used a resolution of 1000x563 (low-res 16:9) and used the incremental renderer in the editor, meaning that the first images would come back after a few seconds. This was usually enough to figure out whether a composition would work or not.<p>To setup and tweak the lighting, I needed more converged renders, and that could take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours. Most of the museum converged pretty quickly, making it easier to set up the sun and these sorts of things, but the planet would stay noisy for a very long time. Multiple scattering in the atmosphere has enormous variance and tends to just spray bright blue dots throughout the scene. Any change to the parameters of the planet, atmosphere or clouds would require a few hours of rendering before I was able to check whether the change was for the better or worse.<p>Not the most efficient feedback loop, but I had other final projects to work on while renders were running, so it wasn&#x27;t too bad.",1421106689

This project is mostly for fun and so we can learn. We are looking for contributors to help make the language better, and also speed up the implementation. The language is still in it&#x27;s early phases, which means that if you want to have a say, you can post an issue or join our IRC (all information is in the repository).\nWe&#x27;re still looking for people to help out, developers to program the compiler, people interested in compiler design who want to think of new features/syntax/etc, writers, graphic designers, ... Also if you aren&#x27;t the strongest C programmer, or have no background in compiler development, it&#x27;s no worry - there are smaller, easier issues you can try to implement, and I&#x27;m sure there are still bugs to squish!\nHere are some general features of the language (some are implemented, some are just future guidelines):<p>* Automatic Garbage Collection<p>* Pointers, with the ARC memory model (Rust and ObjectiveC both support a form of this)<p>* Statically Linked<p>* Functions treated as Second Class Objects<p>* Simple OOP System (similar to Rust)<p>* Near to no type system<p>* Statically Typed (except for some cases, where types are inferred, i.e for loops).<p>We don&#x27;t take this project too seriously, so neither should you. We&#x27;re not trying to replace C, we&#x27;re just doing something we enjoy doing. Here&#x27;s a link to the repository: https://github.com/jayfor-lang/jayfor.

My case for Scala would be that it&#x27;s a great language to write and an even better one to read: even more expressive than Python but much safer to refactor, a type system powerful enough to encode most of the business-level constraints and easy enough that you&#x27;ll actually use it, and it&#x27;s easy to understand which parts of the code do what because the type system makes it possible to isolate and track effects in a reliable way. In all the companies I&#x27;ve seen adopting Scala it&#x27;s been a bottom-up thing, less because it offers some particular killer feature than because developers want it and it makes them more productive.<p>Hiring experience with a specific language is of course easier with more popular languages. But unless you&#x27;re hiring emergency consultants or something, it&#x27;s more important to hire smart people who&#x27;ll be able to learn whatever language comes up. And I suspect that while it&#x27;ll be very easy to find someone who &quot;knows Python&quot;, the talent level is... variable.

There have been many reasons to expand and conquer in the past, and they were all usually driven by some ideology. Hellenism, Communism, are two examples.<p>The political idea that a society should be run according to the principles of Islam is sometimes called &quot;Islamism&quot;. A huge reason there isn&#x27;t much &quot;Christianism&quot; today is that the New Testament was written by people who didn&#x27;t have much power and so focused on peaceful proselytizing. That is not to say that the Church and other institutions didn&#x27;t at times wield great political power and seek to maintain it. But rather that the WRITINGS advocate for more like anarchism than a philosophy that encourages converting others by the sword.<p>Judaism has never placed emphasis on proselytizing - whether by the sword or not. It had a much more exclusive character so there is no sense that Jews living in a democratic country would dream of converting that country&#x27;s structure to one that follows the rules laid out in the Torah.<p>So Islam in a political and cultural sense is closer to Communism than Judaism and Christianity. And we see much of the same dynamics. McCarthyism in the USA and the Red Scare are now replaced with fear of radical Islam.",1421106086

An hour of labor from someone with a 130-IQ might carry a higher price on the market than an hour of labor from someone with a 90-IQ, but that doesn&#x27;t mean our society should perceive the former as being more &quot;valuable.&quot; Because at the end of the day, each person is giving up the same hour of life on this earth God gave him.</i><p>To take this to its extreme: If Superman existed, would he be just as valuable as a normal person? If he needed a kidney, would it not make sense to move him up on the transplant list? After all, doing so would save countless lives. At some point, the disparity in abilities becomes so great that only an ideologue can claim people are equal. I agree that it&#x27;s important to lift the veil of ignorance only in special circumstances (employment, limited educational opportunities, etc), but one should avoid defining people as equal when what we really should be doing is treating them as equal.<p>One should also note that who is doing the work isn&#x27;t important. It&#x27;s what is being done that matters. Whether it&#x27;s an executive or a janitor, the same amount of good is being done volunteering at a soup kitchen. The difference is that the executive could do more good by working at his job and donating an hour&#x27;s worth of pay to the soup kitchen.

8877203,comment,8875971,8877081,0,0,greggyb,,,"> Firstly the model you claim isn&#x27;t taught as an actual model of the world is - for some reason - exactly the model used to shape national and international economic policy.<p>I claim that it is taught and in the context of a foundational model to build upon. Critiquing the 101 model in any field is a straw-man argument.<p>Politics and economics are deeply intertwined, I agree to the claim earnestly, but it was not the point of my post, nor was it a primary point of the article. The article is directed at academic economics, so I address the attacks on academic economics. Politicians clearly have different incentives than economics (in fact, there is a robust field within economics, Public Choice Theory, which addresses the incentives of politicians and collective actors), and to judge an academic pursuit by politicians&#x27; self-serving interpretations of it is disingenuous. If the objection of the protesters is politics, then protest politics, not one of the tools they abuse.<p>>You also ignore the fact that the few heterodox economists that exist are utterly ignored by policy makers - even when they continue to make correct predictions about future economic outcomes.<p>See above - the article and my comment address academics, not politics.<p>>Rigorous intellectual deconstructions have existed for decades. They have a much better predictive record than mainstream &#x27;wisdom&#x27;, but they continue to be ignored by the profession.<p>They have indeed, and only some few have better predictive records - I&#x27;d love to hear which you are referring to (connotation = honestly curious).<p>I&#x27;ll explain this by saying that you conflate the profession of economist with the profession of politician or politician&#x27;s supporter.<p>I&#x27;ll finish by noting that free-market liberalism is not a political consensus, and in fact &quot;unfettered [free-market] [capitalism]&quot; (and various synonyms) is commonly used as a pejorative among the political left of many leanings, and any support for the idea among the political right is lip-service at best and clearly hypocritical based on the often corporatist leanings of right-wing policy.<p>Those on the right who do support free-market liberalism fall more toward Ron Paul and the Tea Party (neither a perfect representation of the ideal, though closer than the majority of the right) and supporters of the man or the party are clearly <i>NOT</i> the political mainstream, but at best a vocal minority.<p>Those on the left supporting free-market liberalism (various anarchist groups and left-libertarians) are, if anything a smaller influence than those on the right, or at least a less discussed vocal minority in the news.<p>The mainstream of both right and left follow remarkably similar economic policies differentiated by the rhetoric used to support them, both tending away from free-market liberalism.<p>The conflation of politics and economics turns most public discourse into a religious war, rather than a reasoned interpretation of academic progress on many fronts (and, as you note, public ignorance of many of those academic fronts).",1421105733

Most of its issues, however, are\nwith its horrific implementation; the Unicode naming is kind of bad\nbut Linus manages to be wrong about several things.<p>Regarding case sensitivity: it is generally accepted among the user\ninterface crowd that (Western) users don&#x27;t really understand that &#x27;C&#x27;\nand &#x27;c&#x27; are different things; they&#x27;re &quot;both&quot; &#x27;c&#x27;.  Case-preserving is\nthus the accepted practice.  However case manipulation is not an\noperation that can be done absent a locale; my go to example here is\nthat &#x27;i&#x27; upcases to &#x27;I&#x27; unless you&#x27;re a Turk in which case it upcases\nto &#x27;İ&#x27;.  Similar although not quite as bad is the fact that &#x27;ß&#x27;\nupcases to &#x27;ẞ&#x27; U+1E9E in some exotic circumstances; see\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ẞ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_ẞ</a> for details.  Similar\nlimitations apply to sorting, which users also expect.<p>Regarding Unicode: NFD is a normalization format; it converts &#x27;é&#x27;\nU+00E9 and &#x27;é&#x27; U+0065 U+0301--which are semantically identical--into\nthe same coding.  As it happens NFD picks U+0065 U+0301 for that\nstring; NFC picks U+00E9.  Any time there is ambiguity, NF[CD] will\nretain the original ordering.  Calling it &quot;destroying user data&quot; is\nmeaningless histrionics.  Most of the time we tend to use NFC.  I am\ntold that NFD has certain advantages for sorting, where one might want\nto match the French word &#x27;être&#x27; with the search string &#x27;etre&#x27;; in NFC\nthis requires large equivalence tables but in NFD the root character\nis the same in both cases.  Linus&#x27;s claim &#x27;Even the people who think\nnormalization is a good thing admit that NFD is a bad format, and\ncertainly not for data exchange.&#x27; has a big [citation needed] tag\nattached.<p>As it happens, my personal belief is the following: Given that users\nexpect case sensitivity and locale specific ordering, which complicate\nfilesystem design tremendously.  Given that users mostly interact with\nthe system through GUI dialogs, which already hide system files (files\nwith the hidden bit in HFS+, or files starting with &#x27;.&#x27;).  Therefore,\nextract the case sensitivity to a layer, used by the GUI, which can\nunderstand the user&#x27;s locale and so fold case properly.  This layer\nshould be available to command line applications so that they can use\nthe same rules if they so choose.  The underlying filesystem will then\nbe case insensitive, but is still used to encode Unicode data; the\nright thing to do here is to normalize.  Either NFC or NFD is fine,\nreally.<p>For pedants: the related NFKC/NFKD forms add a canonicalization step\nand are absolutely not semantically safe in any way, for all that\nthey&#x27;re useful for sorting.",1421105314

It says nothing about &quot;value.&quot;&#x27;<p>The delta between the price generated by the supply/demand curve and the <i>value</i> according to the two things being traded is the <i>entire point</i> of microeconomics as I know it. It&#x27;s <i>why</i> a trade is a net-positive event for society; both sides must place a greater <i>value</i> on the thing they are receiving from the trade than the thing they are giving up in the trade, or the trade will not take place. There&#x27;s a bajillion caveats that apply to special cases, but they are, indeed, special cases.<p>The entire mathematical underpinning of modern economics is <i>precisely</i> a separation between price and value. Take that away and the whole thing is gibberish, and I do not mean a rhetorical or political sort of gibberish, I mean mathematical gibberish. It&#x27;s the whole foundation.<p>(To be clear, I&#x27;m far more confident about microecon than any particular macroecon theory; I tend to line up with Eliezer that macroecon is anti-inductive: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/yv/markets_are_antiinductive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/yv/markets_are_antiinductive/</a> Note that doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;Let&#x27;s just give up and decide it&#x27;s Marxist&quot;... it&#x27;s means you pretty much <i>can&#x27;t</i> know how it works, any theory you can write down is almost instantly made wrong.)<p>&quot;the older I get, the more I think that &quot;value&quot; (our social evaluation of worth) should be based on nothing more than hours of labor.&quot;<p>Well, if by &quot;should&quot; you mean your own opinion, that&#x27;s your own opinion. In the real world, though, it wouldn&#x27;t work. Without feedback about what society needs embedded in prices, everybody would just want to do the fun stuff. Unfortunately, in this universe, &quot;the fun stuff&quot; and &quot;what we need to do to live&quot; don&#x27;t always overlap. Feedback is too important, any significantly-sized system will fly apart without it, and that&#x27;s <i>why</i> this debate is so important and why Marxism must not be allowed to win, nor any other economic system that sets out to destroy feedback because sometimes the feedback is unpleasant to certain people. If you want civilization to keep rolling along, you need feedback, and if you have feedback, some of it is going to be negative. Anything that successfully removes all the negative feedback will also destroy civilization. Within that constraint there is still a lot of freedom to work with, but it is an immutable constraint.<p>(And if you feel inclined to take the cheap & easy shot about it all being &quot;negative feedback&quot;, or how only certain people are getting the &quot;positive&quot;, you really don&#x27;t understand what feedback is or how it works. Turn off your political brain for a moment, go study how negative and positive feedback interact in something like a gasoline engine. Then maybe come back and consider how those ideas may apply to an economy, rather than starting from trying to create an argument with &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; feedback as if they&#x27;re black and white paint, as if they are &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; respectively, when in fact that&#x27;s not even the right dimension to measure them on. Studying feedback in ecosystems is also good; the economy resembles ecosystems in many ways, and in fact microecon can even be used to model certain aspects of ecosystems with no humans, too, so that might be even more apt.)",1421104866

8877085,comment,8876445,8876445,0,0,grellas,,,"Founders build value and then want to realize upon that value. But the typical road to success in the startup world is far from easy. Therefore, founders <i>are</i> vulnerable to manipulation and one of their softest spots is precisely the time when they think BigCo wants to acquire them.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times in these cases founders have caved to lowball offers with horrid terms once they have gone multiple cycles with the prospective acquiring company. How does this happen? They ask for what they think they deserve and they get an offer far below that. Having concentrated their efforts on a possible exit, they sound out other channels and find there is no immediate interest. They are then high-pressured by the prospective acquirer to do the deal on a short fuse or the offer will go away. They then begin to contemplate the risks of continuing down the path of uncertainty and begin to contrast this with how nice it will be to continue the effort under the rubric of BigCo, where they will draw a steady salary and no longer have to deal with entrepreneurial risks.<p>By this time, they are hooked. Then the details come in. It turns out that, low as that $10M (or whatever amount) was, they as founders will have to earn all or a significant part of it all over again by having to vest their interest over xx years once they begin working with BigCo. Do they have protection from termination and the possible forfeiture of their interest? Well, no, not really - company policy forbids this. So, if they want the deal, they will just have to take their chances and, if BigCo terminates them early, that is just the risk they take.<p>What about elimination of risks? Well, here they must represent and warrant that certain things are true as of the date of closing on the acquisition. For example, they must warrant that their IP doesn&#x27;t infringe. OK, fine. But what does this mean? In a typical blanket warranty, it means that, if you sell your company and you know you haven&#x27;t done anything whatever to steal code or otherwise compromise its integrity, you still bear all the risk of financial liability if someone later comes along and asserts, say, a patent infringement claim against your IP. With a multitude of trolls infesting the world these days, this is of course possible. What does BigCo say about this? It puts on its official corporate suit and weightily intones that it expects founders to stand behind their IP and will not allow them to hedge responsibility for it. Therefore, it doesn&#x27;t matter that you didn&#x27;t know about the potential infringement claim - if it hits, you pay the price for any liabilities and for any attorneys&#x27; fees in defending against it. Is there a cap on this? Well, maybe, but at a high level (e.g., 50% of proceeds received on the deal). As a founder, you wind up agreeing to this once you are committed to the deal because, after all, it is not likely to happen. But as to uncertainty and risk? Well, that still belongs to you on some pretty important issues.<p>And this is just one issue.<p>The point is this: once you as a founder start to rationalize, there is no bottom. You have rationalized that you can live with the low price. You have accepted the liability risk. You have accepted the renewed vesting terms without protections. Maybe you also agree to an outsized holdback on the purchase price. And who knows what else. The point is, by this time you are fried. You have no will to fight back. You have no leverage. You are stuck with the wishful thought that it will nonetheless be great to be working for BigCo and to have a chance to continue to realize your dream, even if it does involve some serious compromises.<p>I have witnessed this sort of thing for years and it always comes about when founders deal with professional acquisition teams from a perspective of relative weakness. They suck you in and then you need to fight like hell to get back into a mindset where you can tell them to take a hike. Most founders in this position just can&#x27;t do it. That is certainly my experience.<p>This essay by PG captures the perils of this process in a way that is spot on and extremely valuable as a warning to founders who might succumb to temptation. Be warned. It is exactly as PG says. A truly important essay for all founders.",1421104173

I unequivocally support the right of anyone to say anything.<p>Okay, so there is something to consider here: indeed there are now more than a billion Muslims in the world who would not have killed these cartoonists, or even approve of the act of killing these cartoonists (I understand some will take issue with the latter part of my statement, this is just my current reading). Insofar as the &#x27;I am Charlie&#x27; statement can be interpreted as approval of the supposedly offending cartoons, the statement could be said to be needlessly confrontational. It&#x27;s turning things into a combative us (non-Muslims) vs them (Muslims) orientation.

I saw a good example of this in a Reddit comment: when you enrage someone by calling them racist epithets, and they strike you back ... are the rest of you going to take the racist&#x27;s side by repeating the racist epithet that invoked the retaliation? Mohammad is a very sacred symbol to Muslims, re-publishing offending material (and similarly approving of the cartoons by saying &quot;I am Charlie&quot;) is just needlessly insulting and distressing the plenty of other moderate Muslims. The more this is done, the more those moderate Muslims will feel pressured and start to feel the need to also take a position... and guess whose side they will incline towards? They&#x27;re surely not going to just throw away their religion, they&#x27;ll probably verge toward an extremist position.<p>I&#x27;m only suggesting that the &#x27;I am Charlie&#x27; sloganeering is a little too hastily thunk, a little too unthought. Of course absolutely everyone should have the <i>right</i> to say such a thing, but a mature and reasonable person would practice caution before saying it. I do admit though, that it&#x27;s a bit of a challenge packing a sentiment like &quot;I don&#x27;t think Charlie cartoonists should have been killed, they should have the right to say or mock anyone, but I do generally disapprove of content that&#x27;s racist, antisemitic, holocaust-denying, sexist, etc.&quot; into a nice 3-5 word long slogan.",1421103732

UK will soon stop being a safe country to visit for anyone who works in security (although Skype developers will probably get a free pass - they&#x27;re part of the &quot;good guys&quot;).",1421103620

You obviously have to comply with a warrant to provide data if you have that data, but it becomes much more difficult, legally speaking, to compel somebody to collect information that they do not have to begin with.  The CALEA was conceived to &quot;correct&quot; this &quot;problem&quot; but it only applies to &quot;telecommunications infrastructure&quot; organizations like ISPs, and courts have been reluctant to expand its application to actual internet services.  It&#x27;s something of an open secret that it was easier to simply acquire Skype for $8.5 bn and modify their technology than it was to obtain the necessary ruling under the CALEA that would compel them to modify it themselves.<p>Now if you are plotting revolutions, by all means, don&#x27;t use iMessage.  But my assessment is that the NSA threat level is lower than any other type of communication an ordinary person would be able to use, such as phone, e-mail, or even SSL.<p>Just as a point of comparison, DJB et al recently (2013) published a repeated plaintext attack on SSL/TLS that is viable at 2^24 TLS sessions. That sounds high enough to be safe, but if you consider the server case or the cron job case of rapidly opening SSL sessions, not so much.  And attacks only get better.  History suggests that the NSA is often a good ten or fifteen years ahead of the independent cryptographers, and meanwhile we are at plausible SSL attacks today.",1371469556

The Norwegian security services have a long history of violating Norwegian law (and when, for example, extensive illegal politically motivated surveillance of mostly left wing politicians was uncovered in the 90&#x27;s they then had the gall to place an MP and member of the committee investigating them under surveillance while he was working on the report about their illegal surveillance), and have always been extremely cosy with the US.<p>2. Most bandwidth to Norway goes via Sweden. Sweden is not a safe country to pass data through if you want to avoid surveillance. See the FRA law: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRA_law</a> ; unless they guarantee that they get their bandwidth via alternative means, this is a risk. Sure, you can encrypt the data, but if you trust that this is sufficient, then hosting your backups in the US should not a problem either. If you think Sweden&#x27;s neutrality means a shit in this case, consider that Sweden has admitted to having been complicit with renditions of political asylum seekers to the CIA in direct violation of Swedish laws, so clearly they do not worry about cooperating with US intelligence agencies. To hand your data over to the NSA would not even require them to break any laws, and they&#x27;ve already demonstrated they don&#x27;t have the moral backbone to stand up to far worse requests.<p>3. Norway is subject to the EU data retention regulations, and otherwise likes to bend over backwards to comply with EU directives despite not being an EU member (we&#x27;re a member of the EEA, which means we get all the directives, but don&#x27;t have a say - how anyone thought that was a better alternative is beyond me). In fact, Norway is &quot;best in class&quot; when it comes to implement EU directives - ahead of most EU countries... This doesn&#x27;t impact this to a great extent, except it means all your communications with this company will be subject to retention laws, and if you consider it important enough to avoid the reach of the NSA for your hopefully encrypted backup data, this is worth keeping in mind too.<p>In other words: If you encrypt your communications and backup files well enough that you believe it is safe from the NSA in Norway, they&#x27;ll likely be just as safe from the NSA in the US.",1371468694

Make it 1 if you can (I worked quite hard to make fit everything I wanted into 1 page, but if you really had a lot of projects showing a wide range of skills, it can be hard). If you have less than 5 years of XP, I&#x27;d say only 1 page.<p>* Picture : This depends per country. In Germany, it&#x27;s practically mandatory (except maybe in some more &quot;international&quot; startups, don&#x27;t know about that). In France, it is not, but the latest trend is to put one. Reading elsewhere in this thread, in the UK, it seems you should not put one.<p>* Cover letter : in France it is highly appreciated (especially if there is an HR person/department) and you should put good time into it and definitely tailor it to the company you are applying to (you can still have pattern though, that helps to write them much faster).<p>* Github profile can help but that really depends on which type of company you&#x27;re applying to I think.<p>* Degrees : That really depends. I guess (hope) in the startup world it is less important, but in &quot;normal company&quot; in France and Germany, they value it a lot (one would say too much) but of course, you can&#x27;t change that. You can try to counterbalance it in your cover letter though.<p>Hope this helps.",1371467402

The cover letter is just excess &quot;stuff&quot; that we have to read on top of everything else.  Larger corporations may appreciate this more.<p>A CV should be kept VERY short and to the point (i.e. 1-2 pages).  A &quot;creative&quot; CV is fine if you are applying for a creative position, but outside of that keep it simple and avoid being confusing.  Note that Germany has its own CV format which often includes your picture, marital status, and so forth.  Adhering to this is a plus in most cases!<p>Example projects you participated in (such as a URL to a site you developed) or code samples (i.e. GitHub) are an enormous plus that will put you at the front of the line (if it is good code, naturally).<p>If you are applying from outside the EU, it is important to stand out because of the extra cost and process (which is relatively quick and painless in Germany compared to some other countries, such as England) for your visa and residency.  There is, however, a large shortage of talented IT professionals here and most companies regularly seek out candidates from outside Germany and even outside the EU.<p>In Berlin, you can likely get away with not speaking German, though it is a &quot;plus.&quot;  In many parts of Germany (i.e. Munich), the majority of positions will require/assume you speak German plus some level of English proficiency.",1371467079

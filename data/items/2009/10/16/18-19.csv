885930,comment,885482,885836,0,0,dkarl,,,"CLOS method dispatch does not meet the design criteria of C++.  It uses runtime information about inheritance relationships, for example.<p>Also, note that there is also a semantic difference here between C++ (and Java) and most other languages.  In C++ multiple inheritance, if classes A and B define method foo, and A and B have no inheritance relationship, then A::foo and B::foo are entirely unrelated methods -- just as if they were named A::foo and B::bar.  The fact that they have the same name does not automatically create a relationship between them, as it would in CLOS or in duck-typed languages like Python.  That means that a call to foo in a class that inherits from A and B is just as ambiguous as if the programmer had typed ""foo, or maybe bar.""  This unrelatedness is inherent to C++'s type system.  It would make no sense to a C++ programmer to treat A::foo and B::foo as being alternative dispatch targets for the same method call.<p>Even if you allow the compiler to gloss over this unrelatedness, I still think it is a matter of taste whether it is simpler to require programmer disambiguation or to have a well-defined algorithm for resolving ambiguous names.  C++ usually takes heat for providing powerful more-than-meets-the-eye mechanisms that allow programmers to ""hide"" program semantics inside language features.  Here C++ takes the opposite approach and requires the programmer to explicitly resolve ambiguous names, and it takes heat from a CLOS programmer, who could write an entire operating system using a single family of generic functions all having the same name ;-)  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.",1255718593

If you are in a strange place in desperate circumstances, an experienced waiter finds it fairly easy to get a job.  And very importantly, you get to eat on your first day in the job.  This makes it a very valuable fallback to have.<p>If you're a waiter in a decent restaurant, the food will also be pretty good.  Furthermore once your circumstances improve, it is a job that you can leave easily.<p>(Note that Brian Fox's circumstances have definitely improved.

Similarly, you don't necessarily delete something off your iPod, you remove it from your iTunes library.  The various players you have for music interface with your iTunes library, they conceptually don't read individual files (even though they technically do, that's how disconnected operation currently <i>has</i> to work).  The syncing helps make things appear to have transparent access.  You have one address book, the syncing between discreet devices happens in the background to support the illusion of a single instance.  Time Machine is similar, in that there is a conceptual presentation that you're looking at the same file at different points in time, not that there are multiple files each containing different versions of the same conceptual content (even though it actually needs to <i>copy</i> a file to make a backup, even if it does some tricks by using hardlinks and is COW (I don't know the internals of TM)).<p>Unfortunately, this goes against the majority of computer users' experience.  While that's a good mapping to real-world physical devices, it doesn't work for things that are stored in distinct files.  When I take a picture with my digital camera, it is stored on the camera.  Now I copy it to my computer, and there are two instances.  Now I upload it to flickr, and I still have the other two copies: I don't <i>need</i> to go to flickr to view the image.  Vs address book entries, which are not usually stored in distinct files and have not traditionally been moved around and copied like files (UIs that do as an useful * extension* not withstanding), so the concept of keeping all data in sync is more natural to users.",1255717028

Yet since users think in terms of continuity they create a mental model that fills in the apparent gaps. So I'm beginning to appreciate that good UI's are the ones where arbitrarily small actions have similarly small effects (e.g. the scroll bar and certain animations) which allows for a smooth learning curve (I'm using the term 'smooth' in the same sense that we use it in calculus).<p>I think one of the reasons that OSX  and other Apple products have a reputation of being so approachable is that they give the illusion of a continuous mapping between user actions and results.<p>(I just re-watched the video on seam-carving and even that seems like one of those obvious ideas once you have a good grasp of analysis.)",1255716771

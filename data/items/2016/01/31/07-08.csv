However, I don&#x27;t think they are examples in this case:<p>1) I was talking only about some specific problems as characteristic of the right wing: <i>nationalism, xenophobia, and religious prejudice</i>. The Communists were anti-nationalist; a core tenant was internationalism, effectively erasing national borders for their movement (their anthem was The Internationale[1]), incompatible with xenophobia. Secularism, or an outright rejection of religion, was another principle, IIRC.<p>2) I was referring more to current parties in democracies (though I did bring up the Italian fascists as an example).<p>So I agree, the radical left can be just as dangerous as the radical right - in fact I agree with many who think the political spectrum is more of a O shape, with the extremes closer to each other than to the center. But in my comment above I was speaking about the characteristics of the current mainstream-to-far (not extreme) right.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale</a>",1454226090

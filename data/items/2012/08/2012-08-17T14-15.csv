A summery involves creativity and factual information, and hash is a purely mechanical transformation without creative input.  For much the same reason if you ran someone else book though a language translation software you could not prevent them from selling copy's of their work after being run through that same software translation.  However, if you paid someone else to translate a book you could not sell it, but you could prevent the original author from selling that translation.<p>PS: There is a great post on copywrite that basically talks about bit's having color.  It's not a physical process but legally the way there created creates a 'fingerprint' that matters.",1345215554

Because of its horrible frequency, it is very easy for any man to imagine that the woman who was raped was his mother, his wife, his daughter, his sister or a close female friend.

When NBC puts ""tweet this story"" in the HTML frame that isn't advertising for twitter per se, that is NBC hoping that you will give NBC free advertising by spreading awareness of a story around the web. When the Tahoe ski resorts say ""Take Interstate 80 to Truckee"" they aren't advertising I80, but they are causing a lot of traffic to be generated, and that traffic is going to cause road damage that needs repair.<p>This is what I mean by ""figuring out their (Twitter's) value.""<p>Imagine that their API is really a bunch of method calls into the Twitter 'object'. They could, as an example, make their simple API 'free' and as you tried to do more complex things charge for those things. Presumably they would structure it so that folks could make 'useful' twitter clients for free, but they would have to pay some price for making more full featured clients.<p>Of course the challenge there is that you can't really charge for features that can be built out of the free protocol stubs, because people will just scrape those free ones and get around your code.",1345214672

That film ends up successful, and ends up catapulting them into the big leagues -- one, if skillful and motivated, can parlay that first success into the next because they were able to work with a great director, which increased their skill; and are able to acquire more time to dedicate to acting. Thus, for the next audition, the two people once distinguishable by a better performance on that particular day now have a skill gap as well.<p>That luck was involved does not mean that one doesn't need to have skill, or that one doesn't need to make the most of an opportunity; rather, luck means that a coin flip happened that allowed someone to make the most of that chance.",1345213383

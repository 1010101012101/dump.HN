812443,comment,812183,812183,0,0,dflock,,,"Apple already control the profits and destiny of all the existing record labels by being the gatekeeper of something like ~80% of digital sales (i.e. ~80% of ~99% of all sales, eventually) via iTunes. They have already managed, apparently without waking the slumbering record industry, to sneak in and take over control of distribution - the only profitable thing about being a record label in the first place. Not just one labels, or one markets distribution either, but all of it - all 'legal' digital music retail distribution, pretty much.<p>I'm not sure that the traditional phrase 'record label' really contains meaning, from here on out, anyway. If I can record some music using my digital studio (shhh, it's just a pc, but don't tell anyone), sign up to iTunes Music Store as an artist and just start selling it, I would. So, not only have Apple pinched the whole music distribution business out from under the majors, they've also provided the opportunity for people to sidestep most of the middlemen altogether. Notably, Apple will also sell you the software & hardware for your digital studio too, if you like.<p>So, the App store for Recording Artists, not Software Developers, with the artists getting a much bigger (like 20x bigger, or more) cut than they do now. Rating and reviews doing your marketing. Sounds like an idea who's time has finally come. The Monopoly is dead, long live the Monopoly.<p>Ties in nicely with this which I was reading just the other day: <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/08/23/On-Music"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/08/23/On-Music</a>",1252464315

812421,comment,811961,812245,0,0,patio11,,,"This is an implementation issue.<p>Assuming you are talking about presenting users inconsistent interfaces in terms of User Bob seeing both the A and B, then this is not too hard to solve.  If your issue is with evolving your interface rapidly enough that User Bob would see A1, B2, A3, A4, and A5 in the period of two weeks, then that's a bit outside the scope of this discussion, but it is a pace-of-change issue rather than strictly speaking an A/B testing issue.<p>Anyhow, back to Bob.  When we first see Bob on our site, we assign him a random identifier which is presumed to be unique.  Should Bob log in or otherwise demonstrate his identity to us, we associate the random identifier durably with the identity.  Any other anonymous user who signs in as Bob will henceforth have their random identifier overwritten with the canonical Bob identifier.<p>Observe that this means anyone who we know is Bob will always have the same constant random identifier, from here on out.<p>OK, now for each A/B test we do, we take a unique identifier of the test (the database primary key, or the name if we can guarantee names are unique, or what have you) and concatenate it with the user's identity, then hit that string with a good hash function.  MD5 works fine in practice: it doesn't have to be cryptographically secure, it just has to provide good entropy.<p>We now have a big number which is entropic but which will always be the same for a given user/test pair.  Splendid: take the modulus of the number of choices, and give that user the Nth option.<p>Thus, as long as Bob logs in prior to seeing the A/B test, Bob will always see the same alternative for that test, until you cancel the test.<p>Now, if users do not log in, it gets a wee bit trickier.  You can cookie them the first time you see them, store identifiers in a session, use their IP address (or hash of it) as an identifier, or use other tricks, but it is fundamentally difficult to follow humans across computers without them taking affirmative steps to declare their identity to you.<p>If this explanation leaves you scratching your head, and you'd prefer seeing it in commented code, I suggest looking at the source code and usage docs of A/Bingo.

As Alan Perlis said:<p>""The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.""<p>(You're tired of the canonical link, so here's a much more fun one: <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/perlisisms.el"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/perlisisms.el</a>)<p>Strings hide information, and string representations of programming languages hide the most important things about programs (with the <i>possible</i> exception of programming languages designed to manipulate strings, like SNOBOL).<p>OTOH I like using ParseTree to convert Ruby programs into s-expressions and to Ruby2Ruby convert those s-expressions into strings before evaluating them. It's overkill at the moment, but somehow it seems to point towards something much, much better than strings:<p><pre><code>    %w[B C D].each do |name|\n      eval(\n        Ruby2Ruby.new.process(\n          s(:module, \n            name.to_sym, \n            s(:scope, \n              s(:defn, \n                :call, \n                s(:args), \n                s(:scope, \n                  s(:block, \n                    s(:call, \n                      nil, \n                      :puts, \n                      s(:arglist, s(:str, name))\n                    ), \n                    s(:zsuper))\n                  )\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIt's ugly, but at least it <i>tries</i> to represent the structure of the Ruby code.",1252461792

I say this as a supporter of the principle of app stores. It's better for the consumer on most any computing platform to have a single default system for software purchase, download, installation and updates. I find the centralized package management on most Linux distributions to be one of their biggest advantages over other platforms. It's the single part that's a problem; it means that the market does not have the final say on what will become popular on the platform.",1252461776

I complete my work on time, I do brilliant work, I don't abide cheesehead managers wanting to set unrealistic schedules, and I maintain a certain level of deliberate eccentricity to keep everyone guessing. Now, nobody wants to piss me off because they're too afraid I'll quit and leave everyone in a lurch. How you are perceived in your career is entirely up to you.",1252461652

It's not ""bad crap <i>happened</i> <i>to</i> me"" at all; in fact, that was the whole point of his story (don't just ""let"" things collapse around you in order to return some kind of predictability and order to a situation you're too weak to handle).<p>I saw it as a ""learn from my mistake"" post.

Fair enough.<p>To extend it, though, and say ""What happened in the past is unimportant"" is to say ""I'll cheerfully repeat the mistakes I and others have made,"" which is hardly a recipe for success.<p>Learn from history so as not to repeat it.

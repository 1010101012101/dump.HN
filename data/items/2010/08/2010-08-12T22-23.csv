I started my response to you with, <i>I think you are making some very valid arguments however I disagree with the principle of your position.</i> You started your 2 responses to me with, <i>There's all kinds of things wrong with what you said</i>, and <i>Your post reads like it belongs on Seeking Alpha, with its mixture of bizarre rhetoric and utter misunderstanding of the stock market.</i><p>Do you see the difference?

That'd be like using a db that requires you to lock the whole db to do any writes. High-volume wikis instead will only lock the rows for the particular page they're editing, so edits to other pages can happen simultaneously without blocking.)",1281651445

Your points are advanced and are details that are VERY important, but are beyond the scope of a post.

You would sit down with the domain experts and have a conversation, that conversation could be converted directly to code.  In fact if the language was expressive enough the experts could express the problems directly to the computer.  No current language, that I'm aware of, achieves this goal.  However Clojure by nature of it being a Lisp, allows you to easily add to the language to bring it closer to the domain it will be used in.<p>It's certainly no silver bullet, and does add to the learning curve of new programmers, but if used properly can be a great tool for writing concise and correct code.",1281651428

Verizon gets them earlier than most, so I assume they get early builds that use more of the core network features - most of the testing done is network testing, E911 compliance, etc.  They're not making sure 'Angry Birds' works.<p>There are direct relationships between the spend on QA and testing early in the process to the spend on customer support later.<p>2) Different large carriers typically get different phone variants.  See, for instance, the Samsung Galaxy.  In many cases, because of the CDMA/GSM issue, Verizon gets a wholly different phone than AT&T.<p>Each carrier has a different strategy and is looking for different things.  Many carriers even have specific product managers for each carrier, ensuring the phone is in line w/ their unique requirements.<p>Because of their size and clout, Verizon gets theirs earlier than most (I think - not sure on this).<p>Exclusivity arrangements are negotiated between the OEM and the carrier.  Generally you're working with lots of different SKUs that are relatively similar.<p>The iPhone turns most of this on its ear, in both a) there's one, and b) Apple is not good at working with other companies, because only one person at Apple's opinion matters.  Verizon is also famously difficult to work with and used to dictating terms to partners, generally around making all of the mobile content 'V-Cast' this or that, and putting their logo on everything.<p>As you can see, there are conflicts.

NuGet is a Visual Studio package manager which allows you to add third party libraries into your .NET projects easily and quickly. The .NET developer community is using NuGet extensively to search, install and update a variety of packages from within Microsoft Visual Studio. Installing NuGet is quite easy while finding and installing a package is like a breeze.
We at Aspose also want to make things simpler, easier, and faster for you. Thats why we have moved all of our .NET products to NuGet. Now you can get our .NET file format components quickly, either for evaluation purposes, or while starting a new project with your existing subscription; you can also upgrade to the newer versions of the components. Our team has also added a complete tutorial on getting Aspose products from NuGet. In this tutorial, we have used Aspose.Words for .NET, however you can get and update other Aspose libraries in the same way. You can still get the MSI and DLL only packages of .NET products from the download section. We want to make sure that you have all the options which can save your time so you could focus more on your projects.",1329825449

Current security services in Russia haven't really changed much since the Soviet times, except they are more ""capitalistic"" in their motivations. Actually, the top people are all former officers of the Soviet apparatus, except now they have a bigger taste not only for power, but for money too.<p>There is no big company in Russia that wouldn't need ""protection"" from the services and in result wouldn't share its profits and wouldn't do the services' bidding. For instance, if Yandex has any preferential access to Twitter servers or data, you can be sure the FSB has it too. And Russian security services are no benevolent protector of Russian citizens. They are effectively an organized crime network, acting with impunity at home and with state resources abroad.<p>For further research, I encourage everyone to google: russia mafia state.

But you don't seem like that kinda guy/gal.<p>One of the main things you should take into account is longevity of the relationship - if you think this guy might be around for a few months, then his job is done and he's off elsewhere - you'll want to make sure his stock has a vesting type option to ensure that if he does take the stock, and leaves in a few weeks because I don't know, say he gets a better offer, his wife has a baby - then you'll want to make sure he doesn't take 40% of the stock with him.<p>In the same breath you'll want to make sure you take into consideration how much effort/available this person can bring to the table. Do they already have a full-time job? Are they just bringing you the odd-contact? Or are they full-blown in it until the death?<p>I would also put a serious value on this guy. I suppose the short answer to your question ""what would I do"" is honestly think, if I continued on my own path for x, how much could I achieve alone? If what I can achieve is quite a lot, then would I be 30% better off (I mean in stock terms) waiting until I have something to show and THEN bringing on this guy (or filling this role, even). Obviously totally depends on your business type.<p>Additionally, the old school answer to this question is essentially the golden rule - if you give this guy 40% of your business, will your 60% be worth more than the 100% originally was because of the effect he will have on the business?<p>Best of luck.",1329825173

3616157,comment,3615884,3616063,1,0,swombat,,,"I remember being sent by my parents to Germany, when I was a kid, where I stayed with a German family for 2 weeks. My command of German was pretty pathetic, but that didn't stop me from engaging in a (in hindsight, hilariously insensitive from both sides) debate about whether the Swiss were more evil than the Germans (my hosts unwisely decided to claim that Switzerland was evil because of the Swiss banks... I couldn't resist such a gaping wide opening for counter-argument, and the ensuring argument included me retorting that I felt that given the history of Germany, they were hardly in a position to call other countries evil, considering they had slaughtered millions of people around Europe not all that long ago). I was 12 or so, I think.<p>Anyway, the point of this: I think adversarial conversation is more a matter of mindset than of mastery of the language. If anything, not understanding half of what is being said helps to encourage adversarial conversation on both sides :-)<p>With respect to your problem, yes, total immersion is a good solution (imho, disclaimer, etc). Travel to that country and stay away from English speakers, and speak only that language for a month. If I'm right, you'll build the mental wiring necessary to speak that language in any circumstances (whether you're understood is then just a matter of practice).",1329824571

I therefore wanted the following<p><pre><code>    int* a, b, c; // a is a pointer to int, b and c are ints\n</code></pre>\nto mean that a, b and c all were of type int</i>, i.e. pointers to int. and I therefore found it slightly annoying to repeat the asterisk for every variable. This also meant that the symbol * had two slightly different meanings to me: (1) It declares a pointer or (2) it dereferences a pointer.<p>I usually don’t declare a whole lot of pointers in one line, but still, this is a (minor) annoyance I have briefly discussed with few fellow programmers over the years.<p>Today I started reading C Traps and Pitfalls by Andrew Koenig and after reading one sentence, in chapter two, the pointer declaration syntax suddenly makes sense:<p><pre><code>    […] Analogously,\n    \n    float *pf;\n    \n    means that *pf is a float and therefore that pf is a pointer to a float.</code></pre>\nOf course! If I instead of looking at it as a variable a of type int<i>, we read it as </i>a – i.e. “a dereferenced” – it makes sense. That is indeed an int, and that also means that * always means “dereference”.",1329823552

It’s who their teacher is.”<p>That&#x27;s just absolute nonsense or he was pandering to a constituency. Their parents and their family income and where they live are absolutely the most important factors. You take a school where the average kid lives in a single-parent home, with an uneducated, unemployed parent on welfare, who moves three or four times a year, or whose parents are in and out of jail, meth users, or otherwise completely irresponsible and negligent, and you can put the best teachers in the the world in that school and it will still be a failing school on every standardized measure.",1407650254

A 20% reduction seems completely unambitious on that scale.<p>Most of the solutions seem to be around water conservation (low flow toilets, showers and taps, water tanks, water efficient washing machines and dishwashers) and education (have showers lasting no more than 5 minutes, no baths).<p>Usage-based water bills were also used to drive down consumption, but it&#x27;s now got to a point where 75% of our bill is fixed access costs - as people consumed less water, the access costs increased!<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.kqed.org/lowdown/2014/01/23/how-much-water-do-californians-use-each-day-and-what-does-a-20-reduction-look-like/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.kqed.org/lowdown/2014/01/23/how-much-water-do-c...</a>",1407649577

A and B occur together with a high probability: does A cause B, or B cause A? Or do they have a common cause?<p>Mere statistics cannot do that detective work for us, I&#x27;m afraid. But when a pure cause-and-effect relationship is uncovered and reproduced, the correlation will be 100%: remove the cause, the effect disappears. Restore the cause, and the effect appears reliably.<p>For instance, if we stop the flow of electric current through a coil, the magnetic field will collapse soon afterward. If we start the current again, the field comes back. Moreover, if we place a coil into a similar magnetic field, that field doesn&#x27;t produce current.  These things are 100% reproducible. It&#x27;s not some weak statistic like &quot;in coils where current was present, the magnetic field was observed to be 3.5% stronger on average&quot;.

But what is &quot;cool&quot; code? What if someone just writes &quot;a code&quot; in an obscure language - because that language happens to be the best for the code? As for &quot;industry-accepted libraries&quot;, those libraries can&#x27;t be considered the word of almighty while everybody else agrees we have a crisis in the area of software engineering.<p>On the other hand,<p>> There’s a time and a place for innovative custom-written code that advances the edges of engineering and computer science.<p>Again, well said - but what is &quot;innovative&quot;? Solving the same problem for the hundredth time - but doing it well while explaining why - can or cannot be innovative, depending on the definition. Yes, there is time and place for that - so should it be thrown away in a young startup just because it should concentrate its efforts elsewhere?<p>The whole idea of the article is great - the code is written over and over, with small variations because of platforms, infinitisimal changes in requirements etc. Indeed, engineers first learn to produce linked lists, then taylor them for their particular problems - it&#x27;s like an art of pottery, when the next customer has slightly different requirement because, say, his shelves have different width.

I recall it&#x27;s been discussed here before[hn] -- and as then -- I don&#x27;t really see what&#x27;s wrong with anonymous remailers (the old kind). I suppose DKIM and DNSSEC might form the foundation for <i>additional</i> standards to augment mixmaster remailers: DKIM should allow for rudimentary SPAM filtering on the &quot;in&quot; side of the remailer network/onion -- and DNSSEC might be one way to at least get &quot;any&quot; domains &quot;remailer&quot; public key (so that you could send eg all gmail mail to eg: reamailer@gmail.com, with the actual mail wrapped inside) -- and &quot;any&quot; standard mail client could wrap up mail like that (as a minimum, optionally with an additional remailer added).<p>I don&#x27;t know how big the need for is DKIM (from an anti-spam view) -- how many receive gpg-encrypted and signed spam anyway?<p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned before, I think this has similar problems as remailers -- as far back as 1996 intelligence agencies were running quite a few of them[1] -- and I imagine that would be the case going forward as well (ditto for tor nodes). I don&#x27;t think that makes these things a wasted effort, just not a silver bullet.<p>Either way, having eg Apple Mail, Thunderbird and Gmail (yes, the webmail) automatically wrap any outgoing mail in a remailer-like envelope might not be a bad idea at all. And once wrapped, everything smtp (with the exception of content-based spam filtering at the intermediary servers) works just like it always has.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.hypertekst.net/misc/anon-remail/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hypertekst.net/misc/anon-remail/</a><p>[hn]\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6642106"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6642106</a>\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6671219"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6671219</a>",1407647792

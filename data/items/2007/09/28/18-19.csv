I don't know if it's endemic to being a woman...risk aversion is definitely more important to her than me, but that may just be different personalities, not related to sex.<p>It would almost certainly be a positive thing to have a well-qualified woman involved early in a startups life, as there are definitely some differences in the sexes, and some balance would probably be valuable.  But, as someone else pointed out, the number of women in the hard sciences is very low, and probably lowest in computer science.  Design is better represented, but even in that, there is a much lower number of women involved than men.<p>I suspect the goal should be (if there is a goal to be found in all of this) to get more girls interested in the hard sciences early.  Being equipped to build a technology business is something that starts young.",1191005275

60736,comment,60708,60710,0,0,darragjm,,,"i like the idea of customized social news gathering, but i'm not sure if a community structure is the right way to do it. i don't think most people want to limit themselves to a particular community of stories. most of us have pretty broad interests and, while we may want to read more about a particular field over other fields, that doesn't necessarily mean we want to read ONLY about that field.<p>i envision a system where you sign up for an account and you subscribe to your own personal RSS feed with content similar to Digg/Reddit and over time the site learns your interests based on the stories that you click on from your RSS reader. each feed would have user-generated tags associated with it and will begin showing more (but perhaps less popular) feeds that share tags with feeds that you've previously viewed. over time, your personalized RSS would contain only feeds that it knows you're interested in, and the random feeds it included at the beginning in order to learn your interests would gradually be phased out.<p>the layout of the site is great though. i'm just not into the community/forum idea too much.\n",1191004883

How am I doing? ZoooV is a social news site for niche subjects. Here is why I built it:<p>With the big social news sites: Digg, reddit, and recently after the name change, news.yc, the discussions tend to become more general as the communities grow because we, the readers, have different interests. And because of that, only what's common to everyone goes to the top. Smaller communities have more focus, but it's hard for them to survive because there is less to read, and therefore, we tend to visit them less often and eventually forget about them.<p>I'm trying to solve this by keeping the communities smaller and focused, but allow the individual reader to choose the communities they like and I create a custom page for them where they only see what they're interested in. This way, even though the individual communities might have low volume of stories, the reader will always find something interesting to read in one of his communities or the other. It's like how an RSS reader allows us to keep track of low volume blogs because we don't have to remember to visit each one of them.",1191002680

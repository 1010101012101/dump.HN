1826525,comment,1825569,1826348,0,0,ced,,,"In solar science, the reason we get so much money is that satellite-launching agencies would like us to produce a ""solar weather forecast"", because solar eruptions can severely damage equipment in orbit. The top scientist I mentioned earlier had a paper that basically said:<p>""Solar weather forecasting is much more complicated than anticipated. The medium-term prospects are grim.""<p>He bitterly complained that his paper was ignored. All the other scientists were busy making (possibly hopeless) predictions and applying for more grants. See also: the AI winter.<p><i>Yeah, so in that field, if you're one of the 5% guys and you're actually right, and can make a convincing case?</i><p>The issue here is that in a complex field, with such incredible uncertainty, when do we ever have a truly ""convincing case""? Who's to be the judge on that? Hacker News readers? The government? So that leaves us with the other scientists. If they are any good, they'll graciously acknowledge the challenger's criticism. But if they are heavily invested in the status quo, they might find it easier to just ignore you.<p>I love science. But I'm uneasy its politicization.

If you have a thousand telephones that won't ring, then social networks are a great way to get suckers to sell your garbage to each other with as little effort as possible. They're the internet equivalent of reality TV: The content creates itself, so it's cheap to run; product placement through aspirational, voyeuristic relationships are the paradigm; topics are vapid, memory is fleeting. Gen X mostly understands this, but we're basically irrelevant to the marketers -- actually, in most cases now we ARE the marketers, which might explain why we have a better handle on it. But Gen Y seems to have an impossible time grasping the idea that they're being used by all these neat little tweets and likes. They've got an insatiable appetite for short-attention-span candy. It's easy fishing if you want to profit off it; they're like a bunch of trained goldfish in a perfectly transparent tank.

But, I love that when I type on my low-profile keyboard I feel like my fingers are always in contact with the keyboard and just kind of slide over the tops of the keys to hit their target.
On the occasion when I have to use a raised key keyboard, I have to re-remember how to lift my fingers to type.  It takes me a minute to adjust before my fingers stop getting caught on all the key corners.  Then again, it could just be personal style - anyways, while I am a pretty fast typist, I wouldn't say that I have the most pristine home row technique, so take my comments with a grain of salt.",1287938917

I recently got an email from a friend linking the Gladwell post with the underhanded ""Look at how wrong you were"" statement.<p>There's nothing wrong with being wrong (albeit in a very public way), but my response was this: Even though Twitter may not have played as direct of a role as the media was portraying, it was the open, decentralized nature of new social media/communication that made it so much harder for the Iranian government to strangle what got out. These sorts of protests have been going on for a while in Iran, but those of us in the west have never had such an intimate, play-by-play look at it until the 2009 elections. That's how we got pictures of Neda shot to death, stories about the Basij wreaking terror  at night, and so on, practically in real time.<p>Sure, most of us have forgotten about it and moved on (I haven't; most of my extended family is in Iran), but the level of coverage and fostering of connections just means the next time something happens, support from the rest of the world will be stronger (which I can personally say is extremely encouraging to my friends/family in Iran -- they've felt isolated, until now). Yes, I wasn't on the streets in Tehran, but I was helping some of them coordinate and communicate with shells/proxies/tunnels/etc.<p>I think at this point, a better interpretation of the phrase ""The Revolution will be Tweeted"" would be that in this day and age, if anything is happening anywhere, it will be tweeted about as close to real-time as possible. Iran is ""lucky"" in this sense, they have a fairly modern communication system. Imagine if live streams of the atrocities in Darfur or North Korea were up on Twitter. These causes could emerge from being momentarily trendy to actually being a subject of intense worldwide criticism. And then maybe something good will become of it.<p></rant>",1287937469

Too bad, because it's a good question that deserves thought.
Assuming KK considers both critical dimensions of this phenomenon -- capacity and cost -- then the argument for inevitability actually hinges on the much broader and more controversial question of whether markets always work, i.e., whether  (1) the emergence of competition and related market dynamics is inevitable in all digital technology product markets, and whether (2) those dynamics are certain to assure that such products will continue to be available to the rest of the market at prices that consistently track their ever-diminishing production costs.<p>Given the fact that pricing for many products and services that are subject to Moore's Law effects varies hugely by geography -- and the fact that many such variations cannot be explained away based on other factors (e.g., availability of other inputs, transportation costs, national regulations, etc.), it seems to me that the argument for inevitability (esp. continued inevitability) requires a level of optimism that borders on the irrational, a.k.a. ""wishful thinking.""",1287936269

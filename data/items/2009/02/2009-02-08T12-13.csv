The article states that one in three broadband subscribers <i>admits</i> to being a pirate. That not only means that the real number of ""pirates"" is higher (amongst the questioned population anyways) but also that piracy is socially accepted to the point where many people freely admit to it in a random poll.<p>This is not really news anyways. Similar polls have been consistently returning similar figures from all around the world, for years. The physical media industry is dead, news at 11.",1234097936

But the question I'm left with: Can you debate religion and politics if you have some refined knowledge on the topics? For instance, I took a bunch of religion and political science courses. The former seems much more tractable to me not because I have a religious identity, but because when I look across the scope of religious identities, I see some common, and wide, themes of humanity. In politics I only see the accumulation of power (no doubt a human trait, but one that doesn't do much good all by itself). Of course, organized religious involves politics too, but I'm much more interested in what it means to be religious (or not) in every day lives. There it's less about a particular religious identity than an identification with the religious.",1234096831

My impression is that most developers currently use 4.5 (because the IDE tools are improved), then go back and compile for previous versions.<p>The JDE is on its last legs, even internally RIM is switching to the Eclipse plug-ins they make available.<p>RIM does have the numbers you need, but they're only available to Alliance developer partners, who are under NDA. From what I've heard (which is guaranteed to be somewhat inaccurate) more than 85% of devices are on 4.2 or greater, with the majority being on 4.5, which finally includes facilities for updating the OS over the air.",1234095246

I was wrong about that.  It looks like your bill could go up to US$2000.<p>- I definitely don't know how to cook beef.  In fact, I'm mostly vegetarian.  I didn't move to Argentina for the steak.  I'm surprised to learn that chuck steak is inedible without special equipment, except in a stew.<p>- Enough pre-deboned chicken breasts to feed four people for a meal also costs US$10, which is similarly US$1000 a month, if you eat something that pricey three meals a day.<p>I still want to know how you spend US$1000 a month on food without factoring in restaurants.

However, I didn't go the route of having propositional-level granularity, because I'm aiming for Wikipedia levels of participation, and it's understood in HCI that the more structure you impose on input at the interface level, the lower the adoption.<p>Some stuff you may want to look up (all but the first are actually online):<p><pre><code>  MIT's Collaboratorium (should be an article in Sloan)
  DebateGraph
  TruthMapping
  DebateWise
  Debatepedia
</code></pre>
There are also a bunch of other more commercial attempts whose names I can't recall. ReadWriteWeb or a similar site did a roundup of them last year. But they suck. Even the listed examples have probems insofar as they screw up the interface, interaction design, and/or information architecture. (That is, if the goal is to achieve widespread use.) Within small, interested communities, there may be sufficient motivation to use them. In Collaboratorium's case, they had a class at MIT use it w/r/t climate change.<p>If you're really interested in tackling this problem, let me know. I'm too busy working on a for-profit venture to keep developing my MS project, but my design doc might give you some ideas, even if you don't go the route I did.",1234094612

But I can see someone mugging for a TED badge for the access it could provide. Or any other conference, outside of wherever the conference is located.<p>Let me just finish off with the idea that people should be taking off badges as they exit a conference as well, even if it's only for a short lunch or something. Sometimes I get lazy or convinced I'm going to lose it, but I've come across the realization that lots of people around me treat me differently, or could find out more information about me than I care to let know if I leave the badge on, even partially hidden under a jacket.",1234094538

And yet Harry Potter says that Voldemort isn't the only evil, that the Ministry...</i><p>I almost put this point into my original comment, because I anticipated this response:<p>Go back and read the first two books. They contain <i>no</i> hints of this sort of thing. It was only after the series became a runaway success that Rowling started to beef up the storyline with such ""adult"" topics. (And even these themes are fairly bolted-on to a world still fundamentally dominated by Absolute Good and Absolute Evil - or, at least, they started out that way).<p>My argument is that the introduction of these themes, and the retconning of a fairly simplistic world into something more ambiguous, resemble the rereleasing of the original books with ""adult covers"". They were an after-the-fact response to the way that a children's story became massively popular in the adult world.<p>(Which isn't to say that the books aren't engagingly written, or fun to read. And video games are fun to play - I'm with Randall Munroe on people who look down on those having fun just because they are insufficiently highbrow. But I simply disagree with your argument that the popularity of the original Harry Potter books represents the rise of challenging mental stimulation.)",1234094528

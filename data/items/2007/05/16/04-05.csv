In my opinion, YC increases the expected return of a startup by 2-10x.  But let others sing YC's praises - it will sound a lot better than if it's coming from the principals.<p>For example, this:<p><i>""Angels and VCs who don't go to this are missing some of the best innovations,"" says Ron Conway, the Valley's most celebrated angel investor.</i><p>Sounds a lot better than this:<p><i>When Graham calls the winners, the founders have only five minutes to accept. ""If people turn us down,"" he says, ""as far as we're concerned they've failed an IQ test.""</i><p>Here's some other suggestions:<p>1:  Like nostrademons already said, data that seems objective is good.  Here's a test to find out if YC really does increase the expected return of startups by 2-10x: compare the stats (values if they're available, or maybe just alexa web traffic) of top 2n applicants from previous funding rounds (where n is the number funded in that round).  I bet 90% of the most successful ones were YC funded.<p>If readers object to your sample selection, then use the <i>entire population</i> of applicants.  My guess is that the majority of successful ones will still be those that were YC funded.<p>2: As an introvert (which I expect many of us are), I have had to come up with rules for social interaction.  One is to ALWAYS credit others for my success.  Nobody likes to hear ""I'm so successful because of ME, and If you don't think so, you have a low IQ""<p>In YC's situation, you might consider spending more time stressing that YC's success is a function of the teams YC invests in, and even the support of the community that surrounds YC.  Focus on how those around YC have played a part and its success.<p>2. <i>News.YC, the Startup School, and Founders at Work were great steps forwards in that regard</i><p>These projects are very inclusive, and YC is being very generous by running them.   Spend more time stressing these projects, instead of events that might appear more ""clubby.""  For example, instead of talking about the attendees of founder dinners, talk about the fantastic speakers you got at the last startup school, and then mention that it's an event hosted for free by YC.  <p>Maybe the founder's program was the focus of the article - and the writer wasn't interested in Startup School.  In that case, when you talk about the founder dinners - stress that you cook them yourself.  That's the kind of stuff people like to hear about.",1179291548

22442,comment,22289,22375,0,0,paul,,,"I agree with avoiding complicated negotiations, which is why I'm fine with debt, but only if it is capped at a reasonable valuation.<p>Consider these two possible series-A investments:<p> - Sequoia at a $5M pre<p> - Some lame VC at a $15M pre<p>As a seed investor, I would probably prefer Sequoia (obviously the other details matter, but on average), meaning that if they went with the lame VC I would get double-hurt with uncapped debt (I get a smaller percentage of a company that has a smaller chance of success).",1179291211

It is just what happens. There are thousands of ersatz executive types in Silicon Valley who have made a career out of bouncing around between overpaid ""VP"" positions at startups that eventually run out of money and fade away.",1179290411

I would put the ""ourdoings"" image at the top, and drop the ""ourdoings.com"" title. Its just a lot of raw data.\nDon't really care for the use of hyperlinks on the frontpage.\nSeems like it is pushing pricing a bit too early, I don't know anything about your product, and you are talking to me about money, I feel insecure ;)\nNeed backwards links, for example on registration page I want to go to your front, but it has no link to do so.\nAs noted above. Front page - Tutorial - Edit leads to a crash.<p>\nI assume you are using SISC scheme on top of the JVM, which seems fairly reasonable, but I'd take a quick look at liftweb.net , which is a pretty pleasant scala web development environment (it isn't Lisp or Scheme, but I think Scala is pretty decent to look at (once you get over typing functions...), and being able to grab Java libraries is pretty handy, although SISC is giving you that too, the Scala syntax for doing it is dead simple).",1179288141

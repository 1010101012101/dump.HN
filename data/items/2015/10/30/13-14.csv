But Windows 10 is the best of both 7 and 8 to me.  The touch interface is good.  The shortcuts are great, and they have re-introduced a start like menu.<p>3) OK I&#x27;ll guess at this one.  Space.  If they are retaining a bunch of information it may take up a significant amount of space they can free by getting rid of it.  But I don&#x27;t know for sure.  It might just be that 31 days is a standard tech return policy period and they can.<p>2/4) I think you can turn the notifications off.  And if you are going to learn a new OS it makes sense to learn the one that you are going to be moving to no the one you are going to be moving from. <a href=""http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/disabling-windows-10-upgrade-notification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/disabling-windows-10-upgr...</a><p>5) This is opinion and people disliking the new direction of Microsoft.  You get new features (Like Cortana) but it costs you in privacy.  How much is that cost?  Only Microsoft really knows...  But you can always set up a dual boot or something to address some of those issues.  MANY Linux distros are almost easier to get used to than Windows 10 (from windows 7).  And win 10 even stole some features from them.<p><soapbox>\nI just want to let everyone know that anything you post here (on the internet) is already being gobbled up by the NSA, just about anything you do on  your phone, and now anything you do on your pc (presumably).  Lets focus on changing the law, because Linux is not a viable solution for 99% (that stat is made up) of people, which means that your parents, friends, and everyone else aren&#x27;t protected even if you are.<p>While changing the law is ridiculously hard, if you are concerned about privacy mention it to friends and family so they know and evangelize.  Microsoft is no more evil than anyone else.  I presonally think that at their core they don&#x27;t want to give this data to the NSA, they want it to figure out how users are using the OS (what every dev wants).  So they&#x27;ve tooled it to the Nth degree and it&#x27;s only a privacy issue because they aren&#x27;t clear what they collect (but they let you turn it off) and we don&#x27;t trust them to <i>let</i> us turn it off.\n</soapbox>",1446213518

Does some irrevocable change occur to the hard disk after 31 days that renders it incapable of supporting Windows 7?<p>4. Will it cost money to update to 10 after next year?

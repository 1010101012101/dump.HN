Nobody should buy a game just because it's polished. While I'd prefer polish on all my games, I'll take an unpolished dwarf fortress over a polished forgettable uncompelling  game any day of the week).<p>As a side note, I'm not sure what rule I've broken to get downvoted. I pointed out that there could be more to this story, and that we don't have solid data on how many trial downloads there were (which is a MUCH better indicator than sales is regarding ""marketing"" in this case).<p>For those unfamiliar with XBLA, just about everyone downloads a trial first (every game on XBLA is required to have a free trial, so you'd have to be pretty impulsive to skip it completely), and then you can buy the game from within the trial version's interface.<p>If the point of the comments here on HN is to add to the discussion, I'm not really sure what I did to justify a downvote. I'm just getting started commenting here and don't really have karma to spare.

Maybe in the Bay Area that's true, but not in  Florida.<p>We've been looking for technical employees (cable'ers, phone techs, etc, etc) for a while (in Florida) and usually come up with crap. We start at $20hr, with full benefits, and a strict 40 hour work week (we like to avoid overtime). That is a very high starting salary in Florida. And we've hired and fired 6 different people for the same position over the last 2 years.<p>And I can't even tell you how hard it is to find a decent programmer here. Sure there are tons of guys who (barely) write Java or VB. None are remotely qualified to write code for my sister let alone the company. Either I end up writing it or I outsource to NYC. And when you do find someone good, there's a bidding war. I lost a programmer I wanted to hire to one of <i>my</i> customers (a hospital). They offered us a fee if we'd send him over. I sent him him over. They're a good customer so we turned down the fee. :)<p>These are common complaints down here in Florida; the 4th biggest state in the country by the way. It's not helping that our school system down here is a fucking mess. And that many parents are more concerned about their kids learning evolution than math.<p>There is one ray of hope for us: the military.

Actually, when there's nothing to protect, there nothing to improve, whatever that guy says. And even if you might say that Buchheit didn't suggest to actually dissolve your personality, it very much seems like he did.<p>Low expectations, realism when faced with your own challenges, sane aggressiveness or indifference, confronting your own prejudices, vices and frustration, are all possible when one's brain is mentally trained, not when you're living with a general sense of ""loosing yourself"" or when one's dissolving one's ego.<p>I don't think ""letting go of your identity"" leads to ""a better version of our selves"" or ""true self improvement"", but to a toxic sense of not being who you are.<p>""But I am nothing, and so I am finally free to be myself."" - if you need to be nothing in order to be free, you ARE nothing.<p>""By returning to zero expectations, by accepting that I am nothing, it is easier to see the truth."" - what do zero expectation has to do with nothingness?<p>""If I were smart, I might be afraid of looking stupid."" - that's not being smart, that's being westernly-smart. Change ""smart"" with ""wise"" and see if that sentence makes any sense.<p>Why does someone always preaches extremes to get rid of another? Now I'm being artistically literal: when you say ""I am nothing"", just loose the ""I"".<p>Hey, I had frustrations, I had problems and conquered must of them, partly with indifference, partly with matured ego, partly with higher self-barricades, but not once I thought of dissolving my ego. What the deuce? - I kinda need it! I was learned to fight and gain knowledge, but then I learned that, when fighting something, you actually give it meaning, so then I learned to give up. So this blog post <i>does</i> resonate with my experience at some extent.<p>Preparing for ""He didn't mean to ACTUALLY renounce your personality"": it's dangerous to use metaphors or ambiguous expressions when your next paragraph if a plain-life description. Just don't. Use ""lower your expectations"" instead of ""be nothing"". This is logic/biologic-ally wrong. You can't be nothing, but you can't be all of it, neither, so, in the mediocrity principle, just be something, because you already are (how's that for metaphoric?).",1313906066

2908596,comment,2908347,2908347,2,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I think this article touches on the real issue here but then abandons it for a more politically charged point.<p>The problem here isn't religion or morality per se.  To make that argument you'd have to be making the point that the people rioting didn't know what they were doing was wrong.  I don't see that as valid.<p>The issue, as the author says at the beginning, is self-restraint.  Britain has seen a decline in religion and without the ""fear of God"" there's a certain segment of the population (the lowest class who have nothing to lose) who no longer see the need to restrain themselves.  So the issue is teaching them why they should restrain themselves even without fearing God<p>Given that I see a very simple solution here.  In societies where religion is losing favor schools and parents have to teach kids secular morality.  Explain to them that a riot destroys businesses which deprives the government of revenue which in turn will come back to harm the people who caused the riot in the long run.<p>Basically switch the ""Golden Rule"" for the ""Categorical Imperative"" (which to be honest are virtually the same thing anyhow)",1313905093

2908589,comment,2908015,2908244,8,0,mjijackson,,,"I absolutely agree with this sentiment. This is the ""box"" that I was referring to above. It represents the limit of that which you are willing to believe, in many cases because you believe that you have already reached some level of understanding which cannot possibly be eclipsed by further investigation.<p>I also believe that it is at least as important to recognize that there are certain characteristics (for lack of a better word) that each of us possess which are an integral part of who we are.<p>Your claim that we are <i>nothing</i> presents a serious ethical dilemma, and one which I believe if not understood correctly can have disastrous consequences. Allow me to explain.<p>Each of the characteristics that I mentioned above directly ties me to a responsibility that I have to some ""other"". With regards to this other, I <i>am</i> something. It is the very essence of existence. The mere fact that I exist means that I will always have an effect on some other, whether good or bad. Without an other, I do not exist.<p>To choose to ignore the responsibility I have towards an other is an action. It may have a good or bad consequence, but it is still an action. I cannot avoid acting, as inaction itself is an action with regard to the other.<p>For example, I mentioned above that I am a father. Now, I could of course choose (as many men do for one reason or another) to simply walk away from my responsibilities as a father. I could decide essentially that I am <i>not</i> a father. But that doesn't change the fact that I have fathered children and that abandoning that responsibility will have some consequence on them. To them, I <i>am</i> something. I am their father, and I can't change that.<p>To pretend that I'm not a father is simply lying to myself. It's also being very selfish. That's why I say that this belief system can have disastrous consequences when applied broadly. Because if you're not careful it can lead to very selfish behavior.",1313904843

If it is possible for life to emerge on a planet, given enough time, it is bound to happen. Likewise: given enough games of Go, one game will end with a perfectly ordered black-white spiral. This then led to the tangent of: Is it possible for God to exist in our world?<p>The same with the possible worlds model of modal logic. If something is possible, there is a world were such is the case. That could mean that, if time travel or travel between possible worlds is possible, there is a world out there, where they discovered this. They could travel between possible worlds and teach these other worlds how to travel too.<p>As soon as something that crosses the boundaries between worlds is even remotely possible, in the end it should permeate through all possible worlds.",1313904716

The brain is constantly solving problems while awake and while asleep, building up momentum.<p>Proposal: Instead of expending massive amounts of energy bringing an object of such high inertia to rest, why not just change the inputs you are feeding it to gradually alter its direction? Don't focus on the cessation and extinction of the turning of mind. Focus on feeding the turning of mind solvable or aesthetically pleasurable problems, to decrease the bandwidth occupied by unsolvable\fear based problems.<p>tldr: I'm not convinced the epicness of ego destruction is necessary for ego transmutation, if that is one's goal.<p>edit: Well, I just realized my analogy does not hold for all cases. In Physics, if you want to change the direction vector of an object in motion, to the opposite of its present heading, it will require at least as much energy as bringing the object to rest. So focusing on ego destruction could be worth it depending on where you want to go and where you are now.<p>Additionally, we also know from Physics that all motion is relative, velocity cannot be measured without a frame of reference. I think the Buddhists would argue that cessation of the turning of thought provides this otherwise missing frame of reference, enabling the thought\ego vector to accurately be measured when the turning of thought restarts.",1313904625

So what I think religion has done for the United States is to give the masses (people who are fine with a 9-to-5 day) more motivation to work diligently even when they aren't chasing their dream.<p>But the thing about countries like China and India is this: What Americans consider mundane work is the dream of many people in these countries.

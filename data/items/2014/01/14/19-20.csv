Not sure I can think of a faster way to juggle a set of videos looking for incriminating information, given that it must be completed within minutes - and no more than those minutes. Yes, muscle fatigue would set in fast & hard after a few minutes, but by that point the work would be moot anyway.",1389729595

This video is trying to be astonishing by explaining high level math to regular people without clarifying that holds true under different circumstances. That will make people confused over what the sum really is and feels deceptive, since they don&#x27;t explain that if you are not in a special field of math/physics, the sum is divergent(inf).",1389729564

Right-leaning people saw it as a decadent and weak form of government and wanted the monarchy back, and left-leaning ones were split between a dozen different brands of communism or anarchism.<p>And of course it didn&#x27;t help that previous military leaders had been worthless cowards who continued a losing war to a point where they could not longer sue for peace, then leave it to the newly formed democratic government to accept the onerous conditions imposed by the opponents and end up getting blamed for something they had neither caused not any choice in.",1389729556

The majority of the system can be comprised of packages from something known to be stable like Debian or CentOS, while still having easy access to things like packages from Arch (including Arch&#x27;s AUR), retain extremely good library compatibility with popular Ubuntu for precompiled non-distro-provided things like proprietary software, and still get to leverage the flexibility tools like Gentoo&#x27;s portage provides.<p>So, yes, you could use binary packages unless you need to build from source - Bedrock Linux can fit that design if you want it to work that way.  That&#x27;s a perfectly fine way to use it.  But I would frame that as one of a number of ways to go about things, as the system is quite flexible.",1389729536

Thats one of the reasons that the groupthink behind &quot;PSD to HTML is Dead&quot; is important in spite of how hyperbolic the statement is.<p>There is always an adjustment period throughout development, however just a simple understanding of the medium would eliminate all but the toughest of these problems.<p>For as long as I&#x27;ve done this I have mostly worked with designers that started in print, have zero to very little experience in working with the web and do not care to learn.<p>It is not just the designers who hold blame here though as the instituions which employ them do not require anything more than they&#x27;ve done their whole careers.<p>Combine that with the fact that a lot of these designers are expected to design for both print and screen, it creates a situation where you cannot expect someone to know all of the nuances of both mediums. When this happens, things like declared text sizing is important in the PSD because thats how they set up their print files too. Everything is implicit.",1389729461

While it generally gets the job done without much hassle, it&#x27;s very possible to improve on it. The macro system you mention is the reason I&#x27;m going to give Elixir a whirl, despite being happy with Erlang otherwise.<p>Anyway, the situation of Elixir and Erlang looks more like JavaScript and CoffeeScript to me than like Java and Scala. Of course, Elixir is similar to Scala in terms of implementation - they both compile to bytecode instead of transpiling like CS. But the features Elixir brings to the BEAM are less groundbreaking and more practical, just like in CoffeeScript and unlike Scala, which transforms JVM so much that it&#x27;s almost invisible.<p>There&#x27;s a difference, too - JS is being reworked and Harmony will bring many improvements which Coffee has today, but I&#x27;m not aware of &quot;next generation Erlang&quot; being actively worked on (Joe Armstrong does erl2, but I don&#x27;t know how active it is). So while there are people who don&#x27;t use Coffee because &quot;it will be in the standard in a year anyway&quot; this argument does not hold true for Erlang and Elixir.<p>Just some random thoughts, I like them both and am actively learning Elixir while maintaining a project in Erlang (and I also like Scala!) and I hope they can both thrive. It&#x27;s a symbiosis, really - Elixir brings a new wave of developers to Erlang, and Erlang gives a solid foundation to Elixir.",1389728703

To know why, ask yourself this question-- are people who have no limbs, hands or can&#x27;t see or hear human? Our hands, legs, skins well nearly every thing in our bodies are more or less non intelligent entities at best serving as sensor inputs and bio-mechanical parts which move things around, which give inputs and receive inputs from the brain.<p>I disagree. Do you know any human beings who don&#x27;t have a body?

Most of the sciences that deal with the human mind (such as Psychology, Neurology, Cognitive Neurobiology, etc...) treat the human mind as &quot;embodied&quot;. That is, the functions that make up the human mind are correlated with certain regions of the brain (and body). \nIt&#x27;s important to be careful about the phrasing here -- it&#x27;s not really true that the brain and the mind are the same things; or that one creates the other in an obvious, mechanistic fashion.

The extant HN thread got much more interesting Scala critiques than the blog post:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6829725"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6829725</a><p>That said, I would add the following meta-commentary, which has nothing to do with Scala in particular:<p>Don&#x27;t be scared away from Scala by the negativity. In fact, use said commentary as evidence that Scala has hit a maturity point that makes it worth exploring. When Rails first could come out, it could do no wrong, and I would get regular queries from less experienced techies as to why we weren&#x27;t rewriting our code to use Rails, as though the hype made it a given that any web application should be in Rails from now on.  Now that Rails is more mature, it gets regular negative articles.  Using negativity around a mature technology has some underlying theme that is valid (performance for Rails, overly complex libraries for Scala), but not something that would or should scare someone away if they are eyes-open assessing the needs of their final product against the capabilities of the technology.<p>Really, we are in the infancy of software development.  All languages are incredibly oblique to their runtime environments, especially in distributed scenarios.  Any language that gets little but praise is simply not sufficiently understood by enough people to be critiqued, or for said critiques to get up-voted on news sites.<p>I am not, by the way, arguing that all languages are therefore equal in quality.  What I am arguing against is this: often when there&#x27;s a vote-up negative article about technology X, there&#x27;s people who respond, &quot;Aww shucks, I was about to use X for my next project, what should I use instead?&quot;  And the responses are, &quot;Well, use Y instead&quot;, where Y is currently on the zenith of its hype machine.  This is a bad strategy for assessing technology, because it&#x27;s simply inevitable that Y will eventually receive a hailstorm of similarly valid critiques.  Consider it a given that any technology in use today will look stodgy in forty years.<p>Instead, use the existence of critiques as a marker that a language is fairly well known and mature.  It&#x27;s rather like the appropriate way to use Yelp reviews: assume most of them are fake, assume nothing but positivity or negativity is wrong, and instead look for volume and breadth of tone.",1389728246

7059135,comment,7058121,7058994,3,0,grey-area,,,"As a designer and a developer (I often do both), I think I see where you&#x27;re coming from, however I feel this is more a sign of a breakdown in the relationship between the developer and designer than a shortcoming of the tools. Design isn&#x27;t so scary - I think a lot more developers should try to pick up a little, just as designers should know at least a little about the final medium for their work, and in an ideal workplace there should be at least a handover with plenty of chance for feedback on things like text styles, not just throwing something (PSDs in this case) over the wall from designer to developer.<p>I would never accept a photoshop comp as a developer or send one as a designer and expect it to be reproduced exactly, because it&#x27;s in the wrong medium, and it&#x27;s a terrible way to specify things like text sizes or column widths except as a general indication. There has to be some give and take (and a lot of feedback) in a process going from something static and done without grids like a sketch (e.g. a psd or pencil sketch) to a final website, so what you describe in your feedback from the designer is a normal process I think and to be welcomed, it&#x27;s inevitable in the translation to HTML. The design <i>will</i> change as it has content added and goes into templates, adaptations will have to be made, and the design must be flexible enough to deal with that, and your designer should be around to help with it - if they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re not doing their job properly.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is that dealing with change is part of the job in design, and your designer should gracefully do so, in which case it is no problem if they gave you a vague psd - it <i>should</i> be vague at the early stage before implementation, because there <i>will</i> be changes, and additionally, html is just not a medium which allows us to specify layouts which are exactly the same in all conditions - browsers, text sizes, fonts, scripts, proxy servers mangling images, user stylesheets all affect layouts, so you have to accept that not all users will see content at exactly the same sizes or with the same fonts or even the images as you intended them (if they&#x27;re on a mobile network, a proxy might have downsampled the images).",1389727772

You&#x27;re right that guards/pattern matching/OTP leave you with language envy once you go back to your previous language of choice. Elixir does remove some pain points of Erlang, particularly around metaprogramming, polymorphism, and string handling.

One thing I believe would really help with this would be a resource that discussed the problem in the abstract. As an example, for most of the programs that rely on using primes, whether it be iterating them (e.g. first 1M primes) or the unique prime factorization of a number, discuss the known algorithms in pseudocode. Perhaps this is a bit much, as I would be satisfied with just knowing the words I need to go find resources for myself. This is what I tend to do anyway after I have taken a fair stab at a problem: &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m doing prime factorization. I wonder if there are better algorithms than I have used.&quot; Indeed, one resource for this is the forums that are made available after the problem is solved.<p>Some might see this as ruining the fun, but I would personally have more fun and solve more problems if this was available.",1389727486

Elixir has a much more consistent syntax than Erlang (imo), it&#x27;s macros are more powerful, it has a great build system right out of the box (inspired by leiningen for Clojure), and it can make use of any Erlang library with no additional effort. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Elixir&#x27;s pipes feature, which I think makes a lot of code much cleaner and easier to read. I love Erlang, but I wouldn&#x27;t call the use of Elixir over Erlang a bandwagon - there are good reasons why one would favor Elixir as a starting point. There are probably reasons why one would choose Erlang instead too, but I feel like if you are at a point where you can choose one or the other, Elixir makes the most sense.",1389726961

This may be obvious, but the problem is usually not a lack of communication but rather that the designer/client/manager isn&#x27;t able or willing to think through the design fully. As such, when you seek clarification on something, you&#x27;re really asking the stakeholder(s) to figure it out for the first time.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that a good strategy is simply to figure it out for them and hand it back complete. Not only does this eliminate communication overhead, it allows me to pick a solution that strikes a good balance between quality and my own time and effort, as opposed to having to push back against some half-baked, unrealistic idea.<p>The vast majority of the time, whatever I come up with is accepted either without comment, with minor requests for tweaks, or with elation. In the rare instance that something needs to be redone from scratch, I&#x27;ve at least gotten the ball rolling and given the stakeholder(s) some idea of what&#x27;s possible.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like turning a waterfall process into an iterative one by doing the first iteration yourself.",1389726919

While Photoshop will have a critical role in web design for a long time to come, having to deal with multi-resolution elements is extremely tedious.<p>Also, Photoshop layer styles are way behind what&#x27;s actually possible with CSS3 these days (multiple shadows, multiple background images, etc), so designers who have to implement a website end up doing their work twice. With a tool like Webflow, implementation work is part of the designer&#x27;s workflow, so once something looks good on screen, it&#x27;s actually ready to ship.<p>Granted, designers have to learn the base concepts of how content flows in a website (the box model), but I think that&#x27;s a small price to pay for designing directly in the intended medium.",1389726561

I wish I was also a designer, but due to where my talents and experience lies, I cannot do both well at this point. The problem is that I cannot tell what is and what is not important in a design that is handed to me. I have had conversations with designers where I inadvertently change a margin on a callout box by +/- 10% and the designer notices and explains that they arrived at the exact margin by a long research process, and by the way it matches all other places where the margin is exactly 40 pixels and not 36, etc. There are changes that are not consequential and there are changes that completely undermine the message the designer was trying to send. This is not an ego trip. This is a professional telling me that they&#x27;ve thought through the problem and I trust they know much more about the problem domain than I do.<p>Ideally, I try not to change the design if possible. However, unless the designer is <i>very</i> good, it does require lots of tweaking here and there, which introduces delays and compromises the vision for the finished product.

That has been discussed at length many times here and elsewhere. PNaCl&#x27;s approach is interesting and technically has much merit, but also has significant downsides (startup speed, complexity, size of implementation, reliance on LLVM for something it was not intended, risks of undefined behavior, PPAPI, etc.). It&#x27;s technically an impressive technology but also one with fundamental compromises.<p>Instead, an undeniably superior approach could be to start entirely from scratch, not JS nor LLVM nor anything else, and work to design something truly optimal for the use case we are talking about here (code shipped over the network, to run securely inside a browser, at near-native performance, with fast warm and cold startup).

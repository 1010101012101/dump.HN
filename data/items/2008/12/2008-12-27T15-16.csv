I am not the OP, but so you understand the depth of the issue, I invite those who upvoted the parent to try finding available cancer-related domain names that would be appropriate.

I think small business owners should, however, start to cultivate a difference in perception between small business and ""big"" business.<p>There is a substantial difference between the startup founder who employs 15 and is the hardest working guy in the bunch and the executives of something like GM or AIG who are still not quite sure why its wrong to ask for a bailout while flying around in multiple corporate jets and taking fancy executive retreats.<p>Its going to be very important in the next couple of years to be sure that the needed reforms that will reign in the recklessness of the latter does not adversely affect the former.",1230392539

And it doesn't have anything to do with ""havin' a cutie,"" it's more to avoid going into fields with a social stigma associated with them and their typical practitioners.<p>This social stigma is decreasing (even in IT -- ""geek"" is no longer an insult), but nevertheless it is still there.<p>For whatever reason, women seem to be more influenced by social cues -- or perhaps just influenced differently than men. It's not wrong -- it just is. Therefore, my guess is that a lot of the gender disparity is still extant for social stigma reasons and the concomitant avoidance of that stigma.",1230391291

411057,comment,410632,410632,0,0,gcv,,,"I sent this article to my dad, who is an engineering and architecture consultant, and works extensively with the construction industry (New York area). He thinks this can't work in the US, because these houses will end up costing far more here than in Germany.<p>These houses will only be affordable to manufacture as factory-assembled models. Most people in the US have or want fairly customized houses, which fit their specific requirements. Factory-assembled cookie-cutter homes did not take off here, and it seems unlikely that passive houses' special properties will overcome the distaste.<p>Assembling custom passive houses on an individual basis, by hand, will require highly qualified construction labor, which costs a lot of money. Most contractors working on people's homes are woefully incompetent and cannot be trusted to put in a level floor, let alone a hermetic seal. This includes union workers. Contractors who know something about building typically charge huge sums for their work, and often make awful mistakes anyway. (Typical story: an elevator which, at the ground level, stops six inches above the level of the floor because the idiot construction foreman decided not to remove an extraneous beam his workers accidentally put into the foundation where it jutted into the elevator shaft.)<p>So, at the end of the day, a passive house in the US will probably cost two or three times as much to build as a conventional house. Considering that, in my dad's experience, it's hard to convince people to put in the bare minimum of insulation required by building codes (""what, this insulation will cost me an extra 20 thousand dollars?!""), a passive house will probably be a niche curiosity, bought only by wealthy environmentally-conscious consumers.",1230390914

A little deeper googling gave me this:<p><a href=""http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/node15.html#SECTION02133100000000000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/node15.html#SECTION02133...</a><p>To help parse figure 2.12:<p>'Resting potential' = voltage between inside and outside of the neuron in the absence of any excitatory or inhibitory input.  It is generated constitutively by ion pumps in the cell.<p>When cell receives inhibitory input, its voltage drops and it become 'hyperpolarized'.  This causes a certain type of calcium ion channel, the 'T-type', to gain the capability of opening (it stops being 'inactivated').  When the inhibitory input ceases, the cell's constitutive ion pumps return it to its resting potential.  As the voltage of the cell increases, some T-type channels begin to open, leading to an influx of calcium ions (there are more calcium ions outside the cell than inside), which in turn leads to the cell's voltage to increase further.  Now the cell's voltage shoots <i>above</i> its resting potential, and voltage-dependent sodium channels begin to open.  Sodium ions rush in, and a spike is generated.<p>And the payoff to me for trying to a little bit better job of answering your question is that I discovered what looks to be a pretty good resource:<p><a href=""http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/SPNM.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/SPNM.html</a>",1230390326

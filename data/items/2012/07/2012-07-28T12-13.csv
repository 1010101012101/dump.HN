Has Apple given some indication that they want to own 100% of the smartphone market, and that every potential smartphone customer should be an Apple customer?  I do not think they have, but I also don't follow these things obsessively.<p>If you want to bring up the patent lawsuits, I do not personally believe Apple is opposed to competition, they are just opposed to that competition 'stealing' what they feel (rightly or wrongly) that they have invented.<p>Apple cares about Samsung only to the extent they believe all or part of Samsung's success is built on infringing Apple patents.",1343480371

(it could not be a superpower without)<p>Although, personally, i consider the most ""free"" market, to be about more than tax levels and (lack of) labour laws. The current interpretation is very one dimensional.<p>For example, the US (and Holland as well), do not protect against legislative extortion. Nor do they effectively limit anti-competitive behavior. You can not build a solid stable company on top of any infrastructure owned by potential competitors. From net-neutrality to side-loading of apps. The freedom to innovate pricing models conflicts with the freedom to innovate actual products.",1343480356

Instead of rooting for your favorite sports team, you're rooting for your favorite phone manufacturer or tech company.<p>Also, shipped vs. sold makes any time a company brags on how many phones they shipped very misleading. Many companies are famous for channel stuffing to get the PR boost and to ""fake it til they make it"".<p>In Samsung's case, the sell through rate is probably pretty high, but still nowhere near as accurate as when Apple says how many devices they sold (as Apple only has 5 days inventory at any given time, Samsung probably maintains months of inventory).",1343480351

Suppose I am running a high-security site that needs more than 2 factors? Shouldn't that be as easy to set up as 1 or 2?  So I image having a bunch of fields, any number of which may be required or optional:<p>- Real Name (if you can verify against public records that might be worth something)
- account name
- mailing address
- home address
- phone#1  [voice? text?]
- phone#2  [voice? text?]
- question #1
- question #2
- question #3
- select an anti-spoofing graphic
- RSA key
-...<p>Some levels of security, such as RSA key may be worth paying extra.<p>It would be particularly sweet if you provided a simple UI (checklist as above) that writes working client code for me.  Oneall.com does something like this.<p>Overall though I have a few impressions:
- Not a good color scheme; doesn't sell it. I say this as a non-visual person.
- Include a bundle of sample code, and some docs with diagrams showing the flow of typical use.  Yes, we can figure it out with a minimal explanation but your business model is making it super-easy to do what we could do on our own.
- I think your site (due to the nature of the problem space) may benefit greatly from iterative A/B testing.
- I like the domain / service name. I would actually remember that.
I think it would be worthwhile to partner with a good site designer.",1343480049

4305418,comment,4304832,4305219,7,0,derleth,,,"> the internet started in the 60s (kinda, 1986 definitely)<p>There are three years you can reasonably point to:<p>1969 was when the ARPANET project was founded by the DoD. This is the kitchen-sink-historian viewpoint: The ARPANET was the first packet-switched network and was certainly the ancestor of the Internet, but very little specific has carried over into the modern day. The main innovation from this early was packet-switching, or dividing up the message into a lot of little packets that are all individually addressed and can each make their own way to their ultimate destination. This provides reliability, simplicity, and economy compared to the phone system.<p>1977 was when the first gateway was demonstrated: Specifically, it was the first TCP-based transmission between three dissimilar networks. This is the functionalist viewpoint: Both TCP and the heterogeneous network-of-networks concept are essential to the modern Internet. The network-of-networks concept (implemented by gateways) allows different physical networks to share the same data, for example phone lines and Ethernet cables and WiFi. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) guarantees reliable and in-order transmission of data over unreliable physical networks, mainly by resending packets that got lost. Once you have gateways and TCP, you have the modern Internet. <a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/press/30th-anniversary-internet-milestone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerhistory.org/press/30th-anniversary-intern...</a><p>1983 was when NCP was ditched for TCP/IP on the ARPANET. This is the most restrictive/pragmatic view: NCP was the underlying protocol suite/software used on the early experimental ARPANET, whereas the TCP/IP protocol suite (as implemented by a lot of different software) is what we use today. NCP was implemented by specialized hardware and would have been prohibitively expensive to replicate anywhere else, whereas the TCP/IP stack has been implemented multiple times for multiple kinds of hardware and on multiple OSes. TCP/IP allowed the Internet to take off.<p>Hobbs' Internet Timeline is interesting: <a href=""http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zakon.org/robert/internet/timeline/</a>",1343479955

Nowadays, there are pretty good tools for many operating systems. In the future those might turn into browser extensions, or even become a commodity feature in the browsers.<p>I remember when some websites started to use JavaScript to prevent other from copying their text (by suppressing the right mouse key, catching Ctrl+C, etc.).<p>Today, this reappears as ""DRM enforced via Flash"" on YouTube and many other sites. These new types of DRM won't remain in an open web for long, either, for the same reasons that trying to block Ctrl+C is insane.<p>So I'm asking myself why this guy put himself into that very weak position in the first place, by providing a webservice rather than a tool or browser extension.",1343479601

6820094,comment,6818932,6819751,2,0,programmarchy,,,"Titanium is still not quite the same as Xamarin. Xamarin cross-compiles to fully native code from my understanding. Titanium, on the other hand, has JavaScript-to-native bindings i.e. a TiView is a JavaScript object which proxies UIView on iOS.<p>All business logic is still running in JavaScript. In fact, Titanium spins up a V8 engine just to run your app. This may be fine for the most simple apps, but if you need to kick off a long running operation to a background thread, for example, you&#x27;re in for some gymnastics.<p>I&#x27;d rather have Grand Central Dispatch, CoreGraphics, CoreAnimation, etc. all at my disposal. Using Titanium felt very restrictive. Their API is a one-size-fits-all between iOS/Android/etc. As soon as you want to step out of that least common denomination, you&#x27;ve got to write native modules. Which, if the people on your team don&#x27;t know native development, can be a problem.",1385744386

Which, presumably, allows for price stability.<p>To me, the fact that it is hard to get &quot;1 bitcoin&quot; makes it too unstable.  Someone could will 0.001 bitcoin into existence and pay $1 for it.. but, that 0.001 bitcoin may be worth $0.50 tomorrow (but then worth $3 the next week).

The goal would be to achieve parity with the dollar (and maybe any other currency).<p>The thing this magic algorithm would NOT do is.. it would not BUY its mystery coins back.

The recommended workaround (empty interface and explicit unboxing) is, at runtime, pretty much how Java generics work:  the parameter types get &quot;erased&quot;, and the bytecode operates on Object (the closest equivalent to Go&#x27;s empty interface) no matter what they are.  But at compile time, the compiler infers the (obviously necessary) typecasts, so, you don&#x27;t have to explicitly clutter up your source code with them.  That strips away a layer of crud which obscures the underlying logic of the code, making it harder both to read and to write.<p>The other constant line from the Go implementers is something like &quot;generics have proven troublesome in [unnamed] other languages, so we don&#x27;t want them until we&#x27;re <i>sure</i> we can get them right&quot;.  This may be a reference to C++, in which compiling templates turns out to be a real pain.  But at this point, the literature is full of better ways to do it.",1385742190

I have been involved with several web based projects that have &quot;failed&quot; only because someone loosely associated with the project put a release date and the dev team made the mistake of agreeing (it seemed like a sure thing at the time).  However, this deadline took its toll on the team&#x27;s moral.  As it became more and more evident that we would not meet the deadline we became more and more grumpy with each other and started shooting down great product ideas because the couldn&#x27;t be done NOW.  It resulted in lots of bad blood and several resignations.<p>That being said - I do think there are certain situations where release dates will exist in a SaaS product. For instance, if you market tends to start and stop activities on a set calendar (ie: school year) or if there are a handful of trade shows that are critical to demonstrate new features at.  I think it is about being insanely pessimistic about how much you can actually achieve.  Figure out the minimum you need to demo at a date and work on that first, but never commit to a set of UI diagrams with features that are not insanely flashy for a demo.<p>my $0.02",1385741315

An\n    incoming attack triggers certain rules and the corresponding paths\n    are turned into linearized traces. These can be heavily optimized\n    by LuaJIT, much more so than you could ever hope to do with a\n    static compiler.\n\n    When a different attack wave is started, it&#x27;ll spawn different\n    traces -- i.e. the generated code dynamically adapts to the\n    specific attacks.\n\n    The result is a much higher firewall throughput than you might be\n    able to achieve with a data-driven or a static compilation\n    approach. This directly equates into money saved on machines\n    needed to handle the load.\n</code></pre>\nAdded to that is the fact that the WAF configuration (which is automatically generated Lua code) is different for each customer and so we rely heavily on caching and JITing to get the performance.<p>The bottom line is that LuaJIT is very fast and very flexible.",1385741017

If the price of oil increases to $100, then I would've saved my company $5 (price of oil at future rate - strike price - cost of contract).<p>On the surface, this is a good thing if:<p>a) There is a liquid market for such contracts\nb) My company is actually buying and selling oil for the purpose of production of goods and services<p>Now, consider (a); it's precisely the problem he's describing. Because these banks have large positions in these contracts, it would be in their best interests to see the market <i>value</i> of the oil increase, since it would lead to a corresponding increase in the value of the contract. You can think of it in terms of an insurance ""premium"". For example, I would pay an insurance premium for my house, car etc because the intrinsic value is high, but an insurance premium for a bottle of water would be negligible in value.<p>The problem is made worse because the banks are not in the actual business of using oil to produce goods and services of economic value, but in fact have exclusivity to deal in these contracts.<p>Note that both the demand and supply side of the underlying oil itself has slight bearing on the actual value of these contracts. It's the <i>volatility</i> that determines the prices.",1299911805

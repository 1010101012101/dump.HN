3171311,comment,3170766,3171209,9,0,kamaal,,,"I would like to explain this in more detail. Imagine a person is working to deliver a business application, a typical application with a OO language that interacts with a database. And he sort of uses the normal set of tools for the job. He uses a version control system, bug tracking/time tracking systems. He uses scripting to do data heavy lifting tasks, he learns SQL and learns to use various features of a RDBMS. He also learns techniques for medium level scalability(learns how to use cache etc). He learns to use the IDE, the API's. He begins to learn Unix in greater detail and how to use that for development and deployment. He learns how to test, write unit tests. He also learns best practices. He does regular code reviews. He learns the process of collecting requirements, delivering finished stuff. Talking to customers etc etc.<p>All these things that I mentioned, have virtually very little to do with diving deep into Computer Science aspects. Yet this is the story of nearly every software shop out there. If a person can just focus on doing that stuff properly he can be a lot ahead of the regular crowd. And make real good money too.<p>This also the place where you can get into project management and still have you handson going. Because there aren't major paradigm changes to this once you get used to them well. All you need to do is keep in touch with some latest stuff and you can really end up making a lot of money. And still continue to climb the corporate ladder, be a good management and have good control over technical stuff.<p>Now image an another scenario. You join a major big web corp, they hire you to write difficult algorithm stuff. Sure your passion will help you learn. But compared to the first guy your opportunities to interact with business are so scanty you really will miss out the <i>big money</i> stuff. The same thing happens with start up's. Also you will no longer be the reap the <i>management pie</i>, you will always continue to write code. And the biggest problem with our society is management drives the value addition. You will just end up being a <i>implementer</i> in their hands, you won't end driving up much value and with that definition money too. Over the years you miss out on the whole ecosystem, and you just won't have flow to compete with your peers if you ever want to get back and compete with them.<p>Also the the first kind of jobs have many low hanging fruits to make lot of money.<p>Also about start up's like OP mentioned:<p><i>The high-percentage outcome is you work really hard for the next couple of years, fail ingloriously, and then be jobless and looking to get into another startup.  If you really wanted to get into a startup two years out of school, you could also just go work at a megacorp for the next two years, earn a bit of money, then take your warchest, domain knowledge, and contacts and found one.</i><p>People have to understand, when you fail you loose time, and also the money which you had else made if you hadn't failed.<p>Sure go for the funky job. But also understand the risks behind them. Not all start up's, Big web corps are going to help you be big. There are good enough cases where people have made it big working there. But there also good enough cases where people haven't. When everything is going smooth and as expected its all milk and honey, but if it doesn't you are really toast.<p>I would say, Big corp jobs really are not as bad as they depicted to be. If you do the right stuff(Just do the bare minimum properly), you actually can be quite successful and go quite far both in your career and money wise.<p>And most important as I said, just merely doing technically difficult job automatically won't imply both career and financial success.",1319868855

Must be college interview season where you are too if we're both thinking about it.).<p>Some of the worst candidates have had the best resumes. I'd bet good money they could have talked coherently about their projects, made it sound like they'd cured cancer. But when I asked them to do something not much harder than FizzBuzz on a whiteboard, they choked. Ask them to intersect two lists? They'd use Excel. Ask them how Excel would implement that? They freeze, the interview is over. This was a normal pattern. Thankfully, our recruiters started asking pulse-checking questions, and the number of these interviews dropped.<p>Interviews need something that can't be directly prepared for and directly rehearsed.

Because if I worked at a job I absolutely loved - as you describe - I would probably choose to work 50 or 60 hours. I think that the assumption here is that if you work 40 hours, you're probably doing it because that's what is expected of you and you're not willing to put in more.<p>Either that or you've put in anywhere between 50 and 80 hours in the past, burned out, and learned your lesson. Sometimes, I have to <i>force</i> myself to stop and go home after eight hours. In the moment, it feels horrible, as if I'm ""quitting"" or ""giving up"". I have to remind myself that I'm not quitting, but instead am forcing myself into a sustainable pace.<p>The marathoners learned this ages ago. If you allow yourself to take a fast pace right away, you'll burn out towards the end and won't have enough energy to finish. Debugging a subtle bug or implementing major new functionality is like a marathon. Even after you've accomplished the main effort, there are lots of little things that need to be done in order to go from ""done"" to ""usable"". Forcing a 40 hour work week ensures that you save some of your energy for the polishing and don't flame out after building the skeleton of the solution.",1319868728

However, let me address your points:<p>1) I absolutely understand that ""thinking out loud"" is just a way for the interviewer to know how I think. The problem with that, however, (at least for me) is that now I have two tasks a) to write code and b) to tell what I am thinking without saying anything wrong.

This is essential for many reasons including a) it gives me the confidence before the technical question, b) it tells you a little bit more about what I am able to do, and c) it gives you a better understanding of the interviewee since the question you just asked doesn't tell you enough about me or my talents (in my opinion)<p>That has been said,  you raise some good points.

They were being sucked up into nationwide conglomerates and changing from independent DJs with free reign to play whatever they thought was interesting to being forced into playing whatever generated the most revenue at the least cost with the least risk while cramming as many commercials into every hour as possible. In short, becoming soulless, disenfranchising people with interest in niche or innovative music, and most especially abdicating their former prominent role of being a place where people found new music.<p>Second, MTV happened to be launched at a time when there were very few music videos. Since they had no budget for any other programming they had to play a very eclectic mix of music, they couldn't afford to pick and choose much. They thus became one of the most avant garde radio stations in the entire US and became one of the only conduits between a lot of innovate new music (metal, punk, etc.) and a ravenous demographic (teens) who were otherwise cut off from that music due to the diminution of radio.<p>Once MTV had significant revenue they fell into the trap of thinking they needed ""real"" programming instead of just music videos, and that thinking persisted until almost all of their music content was driven away.

What I do want to know (or attempt to know) is how you think.

I want to know if you can code.  If you can't code, then it doesn't matter what you know since I can't use you on my team.

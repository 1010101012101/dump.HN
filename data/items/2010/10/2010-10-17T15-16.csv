1800598,comment,1799481,1799650,0,0,SeanLuke,,,"> I haven't seen the video [do they discuss this?], but the biggest problem I have with Lua is its lack of good unicode support.<p>Hear hear.  I too don't care much for the argument that Lua doesn't have unicode because C doesn't have unicode.  For two reasons.  First of all, Lua can be straightforwardly embedded into a host of other languages (for example, <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/39qhxzw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/39qhxzw</a>).  Second, who in their right mind thought that a language designed for embedding into commercial applications shouldn't have good I18N?  (And honestly, how in the world could someone from Brazil develop a programming language that doesn't even support their own spoken language?  It's as if Ruby was developed by someone in Japan.)<p>A bit of history.  From what I have gathered in its documentation, Lua steals quite unabashedly from NewtonScript.  NewtonScript was a proto-style OO language developed in a hurry for the Newton when the Dylan language wasn't going to deliver.  Like Lua, it's a language designed originally for an interpreter, which runs embedded in an outer C++ environment and must interoperate with it.  But NewtonScript doesn't just use Unicode pervasively: it was the first major language to do so.  And C++ interoperability with the language is just fine.  So this Lua-needs-to-work-with-C-and-thus-can't-do-unicode thing is nonsense both in fact and precedent.<p>And while we're on the subject of NewtonScript: Lua's let's-almost-do-proto-style-OO-but-require-the-user-to-do-extra-work is really incredibly annoying.  Lua should have had proto OO built into the language, like NewtonScript, and not just ""available"", in a hacked way, through its meta model.  Lua wants to be more ""general"" than NewtonScript, but it just winds up being (IMO) rather less usable.",1287330855

The ads come through a network like AdSense which means all that will result in is the shitty content site getting a lot more money.<p>Second, it won't ruin online advertising if lots of people do this. At the end of the day all ads are converted to CPA and bid on accordingly. It's the only metric advertisers care about. They pay by CPM or CPC, which you can game by refreshing the page a bunch or clicking the ads, but the advertiser's cost will just adjust until they're effectively paying the same CPA. For instance, if half of all clicks suddenly become fraudulent, bids will decreases such that CPCs drop by half, resulting in the same amount of money changing hands.<p>The only real problem with click fraud is when it is applied independently to one advertiser but not the ones he's bidding against. For instance if a bunch of people click AT&T adds fraudulently but not Verizon. If the click fraud is spread evenly throughout the market it has no effect.",1287330387

I've been searching the web a couple of times the last two days and found _no_ news whatsover. In the event of a DDOS attack, I would appreciate a warning mail.<p>Of course if the attack is as bad as it seems, the downtime is not their fault and I feel with them. They are probably working around the clock on that. I wish them all the best to block that traffic out.<p>But anyway - I have learned that I'll need more than one DNS provider to ensure a reliable service.",1287328014

But the thing about extremely popular stories is that they would have been posted by someone else if you didn't post them.  So it's really a huge reward for simply being quicker then other users.  On the other hand, and obscure story that get's on the board for a few hours, and that no one else would have posted gets much less points.<p>Perhaps stories that make the front page for X amount of time should earn a standard rate of karma for the submitter.  Or even just a limit, say you can't get more then 10 karma on a submission.",1287328005

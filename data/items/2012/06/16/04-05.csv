At first, the dealers were very distrustful, but after some days, all the dealers were in the same place. And the addicteds learned that they could only buy drugs in that zone.

The kids were playing again in the streets. And the cops wouldn't have to arrest minors selling drugs, they were able to focus in the big fishes, the head of the operation. The problem is, after some time,  the town hall and the police chief started to not believe in the crime rates the captain was giving to them. They were TOO DAMN LOW. They tough he was manipulating, faking or someway, not giving the actual rates. But they were true, he just couldn't say that he legalized the drugs. After some time, he had to tall, and of course he was fired.<p>I think the series made a great  simulation of what it will happen that we had in our city an area were drugs selling were legal.

The theory is that the best way to ensure that existing structures of power and domination remain in place in perpetuity is to ensure that everyone is happy. Because happy people don't complain loudly. In <i>Brave New World</i>, the unhappy Bernard was the only insider who challenged the norms of a society where everyone was supposedly happy. In that book, the authorities try their damnedest to keep everyone happy, occupied, and productive so that there will be no occasion for some depressed dude to start mulling over the deficiencies of the system. Because people tend to see those deficiencies more clearly when they're unhappy and dissatisfied with the status quo.<p>Seriously, we need depressed folks, autistic folks, OCD folks, and all these other kinds of people in our world in order for progress to happen.

4119830,comment,4117673,4119670,1,0,asanwal,,,"It's a good point. Here is why we limit logins. We stumbled upon this actually and the instituting of login limits has resulted in incremental revenues.<p>One of the features of our service is a daily, real-time feed of company financings and M&A transactions. Before we had login limits, people would login every day and look at the feed but click on nothing so it would not trigger any 'usage' as we defined it. And they'd take the info presented in  the feed and then go to Google and find out about the company or deal.<p>We were adding value to their lives else they wouldn't check daily but deriving no value ourselves.  So at this point, we instituted the login limit so we could be compensated for the value we are delivering. Fortunately, many of those users have converted and are now paying us.<p>Of course, not everyone needs us daily so for those folks looking up a handful of company or VC or acquirer profiles, our free offering is plenty for them.<p>As to whether we are freemium or free trial, not sure. Think we take from both schools of thought but ultimately, irrespective of what we call it, the goal remains the same - build a product people derive enough value from that they're willing to pay for that value.",1339820073

We've done quite a bit with the advances Moore's law has given us, if you ask me.  And software is hard and complicated because the problems it's tackling are hard and complicated.  A basic UI, or a basic web page, is easier to make now than it's ever been.

WordPress.com is a great service, but hosting your blog there is mutually incompatible with having complete control over the source code. Besides, half the WordPress sites out there are self-hosted, and WordPress.com logins don't work there.<p>Some of the features the article mentions, like JetPack, may be available for both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress blogs. But that's just comments. There is no meaningful aggregation between WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress blogs when it comes to posts and pictures.

Not with newfangled stacks like Diaspora, but something that can be slapped onto any existing blog, microblog, or photo sharing service as a plugin (again, think RSS but much more powerful). Why limit your network to WordPress.com users, or even all WordPress users? Give me a common API that lets me follow folks on WordPress.com, DeviantArt, and Pinterest at the same time, a gem that I can add to my Rails-based blog to support this API, and a nice open-source client that ordinary people can use to access all that data.

It records which commits are public and immutable and which commits are drafts and editable. A draft becomes immutable once published, but public commits can always go back to being drafts with a --force, incurring an &quot;everyone out of the pool&quot; scenario.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with rewriting commits as long as everyone agrees where the boundary lies between published history and drafts. For git, this boundary is often set by a convention such as this: rewrite feature branches all you want, but master must never be rewritten.",1450180695

High blood pressure also injures arteries, also causing cholesterol plaque.<p>Some people with high cholesterol have no CVD, while some people with low cholesterol die from CVD. Maybe cholesterol isn&#x27;t the problem?<p>Aspirin&#x27;s help with CVD was initially thought to be due it blood-thinning effect, getting blood through narrowed arteries, but then its anti-inflammatory effect was more reasonable. btw, statins are also anti-inflammatory (aspirin  and similar are cheaper).<p>Systemic inflammation reduced by aspirin (or statins), less injury to arteries, less plaque.<p>Systemic, low-grade inflammation also reduces insulin sensitivity, so the body produces more insulin, which is a really nasty hormone.  result? adult-onset Type II diabetes.<p>So &quot;I think&quot; watching inflammatory bio-markers is more important than watching cholesterol, as one could take away from the New Yorker article.<p>An alkalizing, anti-inflammatory diet is key, complemented by both moderate resistance work and moderate cardio exercise, which also reduce inflammation.<p>&quot;life-style&quot; of diet and exercise is your best &quot;Heal Thyself&quot; strategy, not BigPharma.<p>btw, chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation causes chronic high-levels of cortisone (derived from cholesterol) to reduce the inflammation, and wreaks havoc on the immune system, which of course causes inflammation as a response to injury or foreign matter.",1450180322

The Leicestershire region in particular have let their markings go to pot (I&#x27;ve noticed this in other places in the UK too) to the point where even I as a human driver struggle to know where the lanes are.

The price on the program side is the need to encode complexity in the types because C-H is about abstract programs, not computations.<p>Otherwise, the existence of a computation is entirely ignored except where it may break the logic&#x27;s consistency in the case of non-termination, but from the computation&#x27;s perspective, a long computation and a non-terminating one are the same. The result is that you can &quot;prove&quot; the correctness of programs that are effectively non-computable, i.e. programs that don&#x27;t encode effective computations (by effective computation I mean one that terminates before the end of the universe, but it could be exchanged with more practical definitions).",1450178385

Unless I'm missing something here, where is the utility that constitutes the label of 'application'?<p>Like ""cloud"", I think a lot of people are misusing the word ""app"". In my opinion, an app suggests a meaningful purpose... otherwise it's very much akin to ""art"" in relation to design. Sure, art is beautiful and often conceptual... but design is form AND function.<p>A widget - maybe - but calling it an app seems a little overkill.",1230922695

Nor has anyone ever made a compelling argument for how having tenured teachers helps student performance. Our country's best performing schools (all of them private) have non-unionized teaching staffs. We can't afford to experiment with unionized teachers anymore. The government created the right for public employees to unionize and it can remove that right very quickly if it has the political will.<p>""How good a job would you do at your company if customers were required by law to buy your product? That's the situation faced by public school management today. It would be illegal for a 14-year-old not to attend the local school, unless his or her family can scratch up a huge tuition payment for a private school. We need to set a deadline by which every American family has the choice to send children to a school other than the local one. There wouldn't be a problem with 'failing schools' anymore because parents would have withdrawn nearly all of their kids from such a school and the building would end up being taken over by a new school with new management.""<p>Hear.

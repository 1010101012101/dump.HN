Statistical significance has nothing to do with the magnitude of difference. Effect size is what you are looking for which looks at the magnitude of the difference in means taking into account the groups variance.<p>Also, 3 may well be statistically significant, and perhaps have a large effect size. This does not mean it is clinically significant.",1236913136

These folks have no more lost their retirement due to the financial downturn than I have lost an aircraft carrier full of Swedish supermodels and propelled by unicorns.<p>An inspection of my back pocket will not reveal that aircraft carrier, but that doesn't mean I lost it.<p>Clearly if you've got $25k in your retirement account close to retirement, whether it declines to $15k or explodes to $100k is immaterial to your prospects of retiring: you're going to be almost wholly dependent on other sources of income either way.  (Social security, pensions, income from working, familial support, etc.)",1236912898

Obviously no one literally <i>lost</i> their retirement (as long as there's a penny in there, right?), but all I was trying to say was that we should be sensitive about these things.<p>As young people with nothing to lose, we shouldn't be surprised to offend someone with optimism in this environment.",1236912397

514433,comment,513601,513983,0,0,mdasen,,,"Well, I think the idea is that those details are coming on monday.  But there are some details that we can know now since Cloud Servers is mostly just Slicehost combined with Mosso/Rackspace's support/billing channels.  So, they'll be Xen instances with persistent storage.  Right now the bandwidth question is up in the air since the site doesn't specify.  Given the pricing, I'd have to assume some bandwidth would be included.  At $700, their 15.5GB server wouldn't look so nice against an $800 slice that came with 2,000GB of bandwidth (which would cost $400 at $0.20/GB).<p>They'll probably be integrating this with the Mosso control panel.<p>EDIT: So, talking with the Mosso support, bandwidth is not included and it will cost 22cents outgoing.  Makes the pricing look a lot less appealing against Amazon's EC2 - especially since Slicehost's previous key (persistent storage) is negated by EBS.<p>Mosso's live help is answering any questions you have and they seem decently knowledgeable.  The information doesn't seem to be embargoed at all by Rackspace.",1236911518

514427,comment,509741,509741,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"You people might be forgetting the most important point of abductions.<p>If you see an AMBER alert on the news, you will see it, and probably forget about it. You might see one on a site like www.woot.com but that is in a different state. Chances are you WONT REMEMBER IT.<p>Yet an application that can show you amber alerts for you current location would actually improve the chance that people would actually memorize the important faces and can always refer back to them immediately when seeing the child and boom press a button to submit a sighting or call immediately.<p>The fact that the information is readily available might be the missing key. Until now unless the picture is posted all over your neighborhood, you will have no idea that you just passed the abducted child.<p>The point is, this application has nothing but good intentions to the public good in mind, is free, is developed by volunteers, and can potentially do a lot of good in America... yet it is delayed for quite some time just because of apple's monopolizing process. The letter mostly points out that the apple store's only reason for being used is because there is no alternative, if one comes out or other platforms, it will be discarded because of apple's poor policies. The application is not perfect and the AMBER system in general has many theoretical flaws which are quite real even if given informational access through this app, but its not like this guy is making a profit from it.",1236911042

Sure, that doesn't really tell them what I do, and sure, their eyes would glaze over if I talked about debugging or memory management, but so what?  I don't really know what a brain surgeon does (besides 'operate on brains') and my eyes would probably glaze over if one started going into details of how they choose which scalpel or the details about _why_ they work on a particular brain.<p>Any complex job will be largely incomprehensible to people not in the field, if you think otherwise, there is a good chance you don't know how much you don't know.",1236910278

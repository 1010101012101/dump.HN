Learning programming at that age was a huge advantage when I &quot;officially&quot; learned later: even though TI-BASIC only has 26 variables and no subroutines, flow control is basically the same, and it gave me an intuitive understanding to how programming languages work.<p>Also, TI-BASIC made it so easy to display graphics, just by using the &#x27;output&#x27; function or plotting to the graph. I think a huge turn off to beginner programmers is the amount of material you have to learn before you can do simple stuff like that (I remember looking for a &quot;draw pixel&quot; function in Java, only to learn to my dismay that I had to choose a GUI toolkit and create a window first). The ease of using the TI API made it addictive, and it lured me into programming for hours at a time in school.",1418551162

Sure you can bring a lawyer and pull a company to the court (good luck proving that they discriminated you based on age) but a culture? How do you even do that? You can&#x27;t.<p>This is why I find it hypocritical that people act appalled on the idea that a company is doing what everyone admits a culture does but for the company is punishable and &quot;well deserved&quot; to be punished for it.

In other words, the two entities described herein (the bacterial and human genomes) are competing just to maintain the same relationship with one another. While this is an accurate description, the actual Carroll story is characteristic of a cooperative relationship; Alice and the Queen are holding hands and running, only to stay in the same place.<p>I realize this is a very minor gripe, and the author of <i>this</i> article is in fact misstating the story in a way that is really truer to the Red Queen hypothesis than it is to the story after which that hypothesis is named.

What you want to avoid are those who stop evolving and stop being curious. Those who go to the office and apply what they learned a decade ago but doesn&#x27;t learn anything new. That can happen at any age. Evolving doesn&#x27;t require putting in 12hour days.

8747827,comment,8746979,8747759,0,0,magicalist,,,"It&#x27;s not the author&#x27;s analogy. The article is referencing a concept <i>named</i> the Red Queen hypothesis[1], and the only thing that&#x27;s material to the explanation is the phrase <i>&quot;Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place&quot;</i> as that&#x27;s literally the only Carroll in the original paper[2].<p>Nor is it being used to explain a concept. Not only is the entire rest of article being used to explain this particular instance of the concept, the very next sentence gives a simplified explanation of the Red Queen hypothesis without analogy. The &quot;literary reference&quot; is not a literary reference at all. It&#x27;s pointing out that <i>Van Valen</i> was making a literary reference by choosing that name.<p>And it&#x27;s still not misleading. The difference between &quot;Alice Liddell&quot; vs &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;catch&quot; vs not caching might be correct vs incorrect, but it still has nothing to do with the reason the hypothesis is named as it is. <i>&quot;They must run and run just to stay where they are.&quot;</i> is right in there.<p>Finally, on a meta note, this is exactly the kind of thread asking oneself &quot;is that the most interesting thing one can say about this article?&quot; can avoid, because it isn&#x27;t. Luckily there are some biologists in the article&#x27;s comments on Ars to save the day (though you have to wade through some noise first), if anyone&#x27;s interested in more.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://ebme.marine.rutgers.edu/HistoryEarthSystems/HistEarthSystems_Fall2010/VanValen%201973%20Evol%20%20Theor%20.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ebme.marine.rutgers.edu/HistoryEarthSystems/HistEarth...</a>",1418548682

8747819,comment,8745450,8745450,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Basically everything @computerjunkie said, is what I came here to say.  Having my own health risks and mortality exposed when I had a heart-attack a few weeks ago[1], really drove that home.  I now <i>really</i> realize that the whole &quot;yes, it can happen to YOU&quot; thing really is true.  I know I can&#x27;t just ignore health & fitness issues with impunity.<p>The importance of eating a healthy diet, working out more, reducing stress, etc., are a lot more vivid to me now.<p>On a related note however, perhaps ironically, is that I now feel a renewed sense of &quot;There&#x27;s only so much time left on the clock, so if I want to accomplish things, I have to sell out and go 101% to achieve then now&quot;.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how to balance those notions.<p>I mean, let&#x27;s say I could work less and live an extra 10 years.  Let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s the difference between, I dunno, making it to 75 vs 85.  The questions I ponder now is &quot;how rewarding will the years between 75 and 85 be?&quot; and &quot;how much do I care about that?&quot;, etc.  I know it sounds a bit morbid, but it&#x27;s a real question.  I&#x27;ve never been all that scared of dying, but I am very afraid of being old, frail, crippled, helpless, etc.<p>So there ya go... try to live like a rockstar now, flame out fast and die young, or go for the longest life you can live.  How do you decide <i>that</i>?  Fuck if I know... if I figure it out, I&#x27;ll let you know.<p>And on an even less related note... well, at least vis-a-vis career / tech / etc...  facing mortality did emphasize another thing to me.  Since you don&#x27;t know how much time you get, if there are things you <i>really</i> want to do, do all you can to do them as soon as you can.  Sure, sometimes strategy dictates waiting, and sometimes procrastinating is just easy... but they say that people on their death-beds don&#x27;t regret the things they did, but rather the things they didn&#x27;t do.  An example from my life: I&#x27;ve had a few tattoo ideas I&#x27;ve wanted to get done for years, but keep putting it off for no real reason.  Now I don&#x27;t know why I get waiting.  And there are plenty of similar examples.  So yeah, I&#x27;d say one important lesson is &quot;do stuff now&quot;. :-)",1418548431

I&#x27;ve seen both things happen in medium sized companies so I won&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s the same for Microsoft (or other major companies for that matter)<p>- case 1: a guy in his fifties writing C++ like it&#x27;s C with classes in the same style he did 20 years ago. Every piece of code is a complete trainwreck. I could go on for hours on how bad it is. Anyway, the programs he creates like that sort of work. Barely. But because there isn&#x27;t anyone else to do his job, managment is stupid and too lazy to find someone else and rather waits until it explodes in their faces (i.e. when he retires), he can stay. Until one day a new manager steps in and immediately sees the problem and lets the guy go. Would you really call this discrimination or rather the proper thing to do?<p>- case 2: the opposite. Decent guy in his fifties, hard working, always learning, writing proper code, not afraid to speak up. The letter eventually yielding him fired because (again) of stupid managment: one manager able to convince the rest he&#x27;s too old and too costly too keep, rest of the pack too lazy too stand up and just let it happen.. That is discrimination.",1418548390

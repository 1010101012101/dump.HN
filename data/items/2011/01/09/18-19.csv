Details depend on the curriculum in question, but recently when we faced this problem at a university recruitment a simple ""Hey, what's a generator and why would you want it?"" seemed to separate out the real learners from the classroom coasters.<p>Not that it really mattered that much, you still want to see learning of languages not in the curriculum and no 4-year program will ever cover all the interesting possibilities. We just learned that where ""Java, C++, C, nothing else"" is a warning sign from one university, ""Python, C++, C, nothing else"" was the warning sign from that one. You could probably generalize to ""C, (Java/C++), exactly one other"" and still be right.",1294599569

This means that permanent contracts are getting harder and harder to come by in academia.<p>Three main reasons for this in the Netherlands:\n * A permanent employee of a university is considered a civil servant, which means that it is impossible to fire him.\n * A temporary employee is ""protected"" by law; after three consecutive temporary contracts, the next contract is by law a permanent one.\n * Most funds at the university come from limited time projects.<p>This means that universities are very hesitant to hire people on a permanent contract and labour protection laws sort of turn against you.",1294599321

But if I got on a plane to Australia, I have every reason to expect that it will go to a real place called Australia, rather than secretly taking me to Botswana or something. By your definition, a belief in Australia and a belief in unicorns are both lumped under the category of blind faith, which I think is a really silly classification.<p>All our observations of the world -- even sight, sound, smell, and so on -- are indirect. Your eyes don't see all wavelengths, and they can be tricked into confusing combinations of red, green, and blue as ""the same color"" as a pure wavelength of light.

You can't shift your songs around because it's actually illegal. That's a hard thing to overcome with a couple of guys, some computers, and some technical wizardry. And while you can solve some of the local problems, like work out a deal with Sirius or whatever, you're going to have a hard time putting together a solid, across-the-board solution, and then even if you have it the content providers are going to try to squeeze you and make themselves very problematic to deal with. You're going to have badly siloed content. By comparison the technical problems seem almost insignificant.<p>Web pages we lucked out with a bit because the medium was always something that could be rendered from many types of browsers, but one of these days someone is going to say ""You can't use Instapaper on this page without paying us money"" and throw an epic-level legal hissy fit, and the courts may very well side with them.<p>Not saying this is unsolvable by any means but it's definitely a high-risk idea.",1294596468

I'm not sure the HN title is entirely accurate.  Its more an 'experience report' than a comparison.<p>In order to draw a fully qualified conclusion from the article I'd say, 'A specially selected group of students, formally educated up to an A Level standard [0] were able to equal the job performance of general university educated students after being put through a University specializing in the work that we do.'<p>I'm frankly surprised that the candidates who were put through this specialist university weren't able to massively outperform those from more general schools.  Of course I don't really know how long Advent University lasts for, or the extent to which you teach specialist skills or transferable skills.<p>It is a strange situation though - I've got a PhD and I know some friends who have mediocre undergraduate grades, say 2.2s or 3s.  They'd make great hires and doing really well in their jobs.  It would really be interesting to see if anyone particularly targets this group in their hiring.<p>[0] UK qualification at pre Uni-age - I haven't enough idea how the education in different countries compares are this age really to compare US/UK systems.",1294596402

Culture has had that problem for millenia, and we have developed numerous mechanisms for coping with it. There have been countless books written over the centuries, and even more lately, so how come I can consistently find sources of the best literature written by man? The same mechanism, curation and word of mouth in circles that care about quality, will apply in the future, as it did in the past.<p>Your retort to this might be, ""but most people don't have access to this curated content supply, they're stuck with the manipulative garbage produced for the masses"". But that's always been the case, and it's not specifically an internet problem. Different people have different value-needs. Not everyone wants to read Dickens. Some people really just want to read Mills&Boons. The same is true on the web.",1294596305

They can &quot;read&quot; pheromones from any adjacent cell.<p>They leave a pheromone every movement depending on which state they are in, either &quot;find food&quot; or &quot;return food&quot;.<p>In my system, the pheromones have a strength. Whenever an ant touches the nest, his &quot;nest pheromone&quot; is at full strength (255). Each movement decreases the strength by 1. This sets up a natural gradient of nest strength for ants to follow. They also &quot;deteriorate&quot; each round as yours do.<p>A similar setup is used with food, such that a high food scent is created when they pick up food, and decreases in strength as they return to the nest.<p>So to find food, they try to move up a food gradient or down the nest gradient (away from the nest), while to return food they move up the nest gradient (towards the nest).<p>Their searching consists of a random walking into cells that have no nest scent, or following a food trail.<p>They have an energy cost for moving, and if it&#x27;s too low they have to eat a piece of food. Returning a piece of food to the hill spawns a new ant. The lines on the right side show the population of each colony and the total food on the board.<p>From these extremely basic rules, they are very efficient at clearing the &quot;world&quot; of food.",1413327355

Therefore, the question you posed has been sitting in the back of my mind: how do you align the incentives of the customer and company in this case?<p>The answer that I came up with: the company will charge less each failed date. This way, after a certain amount of dates, they will theoretically lose money by having you as a customer. This incentivizes them to get you a good match before then. On the flip side, the initial price should be high enough such that it is in the users interest to see if it will work out rather then giving up easily. Lastly, if the previous date request is months before the current one, the company can say that the previous date was a success and start over.<p>The only problem that I dont know how to deal with is the user whose goal isnt to get a date, but to harm the company. My guess is that some sort of feedback from the dates can asses whether or not this is indeed happening.",1413327195

Many viruses that have been in the human population for a long time have quite high death rates in immune naive populations (think of small pox as an example).<p>Secondly, the mechanism of transmission of Ebola is quite closely tied to the cause of death. To be transmitted it needs to turn you into a massive viral factory and then make you very “leaky” so the virus gets spilled out into the environment. Any mutations that decrease mortality are also likely to decrease the infectiousness of Ebola<p>Thirdly, Ebola is starting off from a very high death rate. Even if there was a major decrease in the mortality rate (say it only kill 5% instead of 50 to 75% people), it would still be a huge problem.",1413327192

Probably been to a dozen dates/events. Of that I&#x27;ve only been on two &quot;bad&quot; dates. I define that as dates where I felt we just didn&#x27;t have anything in common and/or they were completely not my type. Most were mediocre, but we had fun, mostly because I know how to be entertaining over drinks. A couple I was interested in but never really had a good relationship develop from it. In general, I had fun so it was money well spent.<p>I&#x27;m new to the city and the site was a great way to meet totally new people frequently without having to jump through all the hoops of stuff like OkCupid.<p>I have to say I am curious about this &quot;pivot&quot; in how you are approaching matchmaking. It is nice to have an &quot;out&quot; and not waste my time if it is clear that I won&#x27;t find the person attractive mentally or physically.<p>Honestly I think I&#x27;ve stuck with the site out of curiosity, and not really the expectation of having a good date. Over the past year I&#x27;ve had much better success finding relationships using OkCupid in NYC than your service. Mostly because I can better select dates that are attractive and interesting. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",1413326702

The way Ebola is constructed it is very unlikely to become airborne [1], but it could increase in natural reproductive efficiency (R0). We really have no idea of the R0 for Ebola right now as we don’t have the people on the ground recording what is happening in the community.<p>Ebola does not have to become airborne for it to be a problem. Polio is not airborne and it has a very high R0 (5 − 7). The difference is polio is adapted for human-to-human transmission while Ebola is very unlikely to be. I don’t want to find out how well adapted Ebola can become.<p>[1] Something that I have noticed about the discussion here is many people are unclear about what it mean for a virus to be “airborne” (this is not surprising since most people are not virologists). What airborne mean is that the virus is adapted to spreading via small mucosal droplets. The classic virus for this is rhinovirus (the most common cold virus). Rhinovirus infects the mucosal cells of the upper respiratory tract, it causes you to produce lots of mucus, it makes you sneeze a lot releasing this mucus in small droplets into the air, the virus is hardy enough to survive in the small mucosal droplets, and it doesn’t make you that ill so you still go to work where you can spread it around your co-workers. Doing all the things required the evolution of many interlocking adaptations in the Rhinovirus genome.<p>Ebola&#x27;s infection mechanism is nothing like Rhinovirus. While in theory it is possible that Ebola could acquire all the adaptions required to be spread efficiently by small mucosal droplets, it is really unlikely as there are so many changes required. This is why most experts think it is unlikely that Ebola will become “airborne”.",1413325265

But if you go through the list of companies it has funded, a good number would have a very difficult time making a prima facie case that they fit the profile of a business that can achieve significant growth and scale. Dating Ring is the perfect example of that.<p>There are numerous challenges associated with breaking into the online dating space generally. First, the costs of customer acquisition are typically quite high because there&#x27;s so much competition. That makes it very difficult for new services to gain traction without significant investment in advertising. Second, there&#x27;s an additional level of churn built in to this market because when a dating service works, it loses customers. That produces a constant need for investment in the aforementioned user acquisition which is so costly.<p>More specifically, Dating Ring seems to be positioned in no man&#x27;s land (no pun intended). It can&#x27;t compete with the quantity and immediate gratification of online services that cost nothing or roughly the same, and it can&#x27;t compete with the quality and exclusivity of matchmaking services which generally have costs signaling much higher value.<p>If the OP&#x27;s comment is true, Dating Ring would ironically appear to be offering the worst of both worlds by trying to package users from the former as part of a service masquerading as the latter. Even with adjustments to its model, the odds that this company ever achieves &quot;hyper-growth&quot; or becomes a very large business are next to nil.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBYhVcO4WgI</a>",1413324697

Trials could result in more software getting purchased (and fewer instances of feeling burned, meaning more likelihood of future MAS purchases). Lowering the 30% would trickle savings down to customers, as producers could price more aggressively for the same marginal revenue and try to drive up volume.<p>The only change I see that could affect the price of sofware is paid upgrades, which does fundamentally alter the pricing dynamic by incentivizing an unpleasant upgrade treadmill in the worst cases. But the problem is, companies whose revenue is dependent on upgrades will still do so, only badly: either using &quot;MyApp 3&quot; (which is awkward, and doesn&#x27;t allow upgrade pricing for existing users); or, using in-app purchases, which is a weird experience, and has a huge drag co-efficient by requiring developers to support all old functionality in the same app, forever. (Imagine if Pixelmator 4 had to encapsulate every last bit of Pixelmators 1-3, bug-free, within version 4. It&#x27;s a recipe for disaster for both users and developers, making it cost-prohibitive to do under-the-hood improvements instead of just Features Features Features, meaning more technical debt.)<p>If there&#x27;s another way in which my suggestions alter the price of software as commodity, or alter consumer pricing psychology, please point it out.",1413324446

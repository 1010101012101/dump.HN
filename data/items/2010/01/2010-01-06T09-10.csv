1034463,comment,1032875,1033946,0,0,yannis,,,"<i>Yeah I think they work differently in general. From my experience they do not benefit from iterative development the same way we do. They do but they iterate when solving the problem, usually on paper.</i><p>This is partly true in my experience and you will struggle to find a Mechanical Engineer that doesn't know what Kaizen is. With engineering iterating is <i>expensive</i> so iteration normally would happen at design stage. However, when it comes to Construction there are different levels of iteration, for example the Consultant will produce a set of specs and drawings but is up to the specialists to produce the detail studies and shop drawings.They will also spent months with mock-ups in order to confirm compliance with requirements.<p>However, I think every Engineering discipline (and I include Software Engineering here) can learn a lesson or two from Sanitary Engineers:) Systems produced by Drainage Engineers virtually outlive the buildings they are installed, large part of such systems are standardized (use your standard libraries). They run for almost ever and anywhere (ie, quality assurance brings reliability), they require almost no maintenenace (minimize bugs). They have very well defined objectives (no feature creep). If they  don't perform well they stink so someone notices and does something about it! They employ  'set of primitives or principles' like gravity that always works, they are simple and construction can be delegated to cheaper labour (outsourcing). It is not a very glamorous field but civilization progressed when this field progressed (social responsibility). They are not expensive to design and produce. They use standard details (ie DRY principle) and I have seen .. a lot of these Sanitary Engineers debating if their discipline is ... art, engineering or science. Rings a bell?<p>Mechanical Engineering like IT - should be IE Information Engineering:) - has is own disasters and Management problems.<p>It is a very creative field and the only unfortunate thing is that it does not benefit from - open source. In this respect anyone in Software Engineering, should count themselves lucky!<p><i>Qualifier</i> I hold a PhD in Mechanical Engineering",1262771566

The oil is not even a factor, and will run out eventually anyway.<p>Isn't this imperialist thinking of the very worst type?<p>Like in all things I defer to the superior words of the masters:<p><i>""It is as you say, of course,"" Shoum said smoothly.

One might intervene and interfere at every available opportunity and at every single instant when things did not turn out as any decent and reasonable creature would like.

My strategy for competing with Microsoft Excel is two-fold: first, I'm not Microsoft and second, I don't sell Excel.<p>Plus, if you'll forgive me one of my hobbyhorses: there is a titanic gulf between your application's feature set and your business.  I think as engineers we look at the feature set and see 90% of the value, and naturally assume that something with 100 times the features is 100 times better.  I think the truth is that the application itself is closer to 10% of the value, and that huge ginormous feature sets have costs as well as benefits.<p>One quick example: if you have a very focused vision of your product or users, you can afford to play depth-versus-breadth on marketing to your niche.",1262770266

The absolute best thing for the ordinary arab people that the USA and all the other oil importers could do is immediately stop buying oil. And the unpleasant truth is that every dollar you spend at the petrol pump is indeed a vote in support of those despicable regimes.""<p>For the moment put countries in the Middle East aside and think about car companies during this recession.  When people started buying fewer cars what did those companies do?  They cut prices, offered better terms and did everything else they could to undercut their competitors.<p>Now go back to the Middle East.  If you significantly reduce the wealth going into the region what will happen?  You'll create a situation where they begin trying to take wealth from each other in a region where the two things they DO have in abundance are weapons and fuel.  You'd end up completely destabilizing the region by causing massive warfare.<p>And before anyone says ""But that will cause the populace to revolt"" I urge you to look at the Iraq/Iran war which had a devastating amount of civilian casualties and which in the end strengthened both despotic regimes.  When your home has been destroyed and most of your family has been killed you look to protect whats left not take on the government.

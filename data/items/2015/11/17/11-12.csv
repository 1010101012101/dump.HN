We can bomb Daesh, which only encourages more to join their cause. Worst case, we can nuke the whole area of Iraq and Syria where Daesh has power, and that would only show every Muslim in the world that we are intolerant of Islam.<p>This is a war of ideology, and that war cannot be fought with guns and bombs. It has to start from the ground, with &#x27;militant moderate Muslims&#x27; willing to show people another way; one that does not involve in slavery, beheadings, suicide bombings, and crucifixion. Weaponry has its place to keep the borders of that state in its place, given that we know their religious orders are of limitless expansion and no regard for state boundaries.",1447761553

Putin of course offered his support in destroying ISIS, he for sure wants ISIS out of the picture, dead and buried.

During this period both of the parties have sufficiently ruled Washington with same policy.<p>Glenn Greenwald provides further documentation that the various Middle Eastern and North African wars were planned before 9/11 [1]<p>&quot;General Wesley Clark … said the aim of this plot [to “destroy the governments in … Iraq, … Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran”] was this: “They wanted us to destabilize the Middle East, turn it upside down, make it under our control.” He then recounted a conversation he had had ten years earlier with Paul Wolfowitz — back in 1991 — in which the then-number-3-Pentagon-official, after criticizing Bush 41 for not toppling Saddam, told Clark: “But one thing we did learn [from the Persian Gulf War] is that we can use our military in the region – in the Middle East – and the Soviets won’t stop us. And we’ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet regimes – Syria, Iran [sic], Iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.” Clark said he was shocked by Wolfowitz’s desires because, as Clark put it: “the purpose of the military is to start wars and change governments? It’s not to deter conflicts?”<p>[I]n the aftermath of military-caused regime change in Iraq and Libya … with concerted regime change efforts now underway aimed at Syria and Iran, with active and escalating proxy fighting in Somalia, with a modest military deployment to South Sudan, and the active use of drones in six — count ‘em: six — different Muslim countries, it is worth asking whether the neocon dream as laid out by Clark is dead or is being actively pursued and fulfilled, albeit with means more subtle and multilateral than full-on military invasions (it’s worth remembering that neocons specialized in dressing up their wars in humanitarian packaging: Saddam’s rape rooms! Gassed his own people!). As Jonathan Schwarz … put it about the supposedly contentious national security factions:<p>As far as I can tell, there’s barely any difference in goals within the foreign policy establishment. They just disagree on the best methods to achieve the goals. My guess is that everyone agrees we have to continue defending the mideast from outside interference (I love that Hillary line), and the [Democrats] just think that best path is four overt wars and three covert actions, while the neocons want to jump straight to seven wars.\nThe neocon end as Clark reported them — regime change in those seven countries — seems as vibrant as ever. It’s just striking to listen to Clark describe those 7 countries in which the neocons plotted to have regime change back in 2001, and then compare that to what the U.S. Government did and continues to do since then with regard to those precise countries.\n&quot;<p>0: <a href=""http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/57-years-ago-u-s-britain-approved-use-islamic-extremists-topple-syrian-government.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/57-years-ago-u-s-brit...</a>\n1: <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/11/26/wes_clark_and_the_neocon_dream/singleton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/11/26/wes_clark_and_the_neocon_dre...</a><p>edit:\n2: <a href=""http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-planned-regime-change-throughout-the-middle-east-and-northern-africa-20-years-ago.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/11/neoconservatives-plan...</a><p>from [2]:\n&quot;Found actual video clips of Clarke explaining the long-standing plans for regime change …\nIn the following clip, Clarke says<p>I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, “Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.” I said, “Well, you’re too busy.” He said, “No, no.” He says, “We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September.<p><i></i>*<p>So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.”<p>And in this clip, Clarke says<p>It came back to me … a 1991 meeting I had with Paul Wolfowitz.<p><i></i>*<p>In 1991, he was the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy – the number 3 position at the Pentagon. And I had gone to see him when I was a 1-Star General commanding the National Training Center.<p><i></i>*<p>And I said, “Mr. Secretary, you must be pretty happy with the performance of the troops in Desert Storm.”<p>And he said: “Yeah, but not really, because the truth is we should have gotten rid of Saddam Hussein, and we didn’t … But one thing we did learn [from the Persian Gulf War] is that we can use our military in the region – in the Middle East – and the Soviets won’t stop us. And we’ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet client regimes – Syria, Iran, Iraq – before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us.”",1447761308

Just take away their primary income so they&#x27;ll internally bleed out... The people who come from Europe woudn&#x27;t like it there if they don&#x27;t receive any money.<p>- Track down the big import behaviour of Western Products (  Red Bull, Nutella, Hummers, ... ) that IS terrorists love. Elimnate the import of it. They don&#x27;t want Western products, no problem. Cut them off the economy and black market as quick as possible.<p>- Make it illegal to buy black market oil from IS, track down people who want to have some quick money.<p>- Invest in rebels that attack IS on the ground ( some people from France and the UK voluntarely go there)<p>- If there is any proof of Middle East supports IS. Then take economic sanctions. Work together with Russia, America, Europe and China. Invest in oil alternatives FAST<p>- Put a website online www.worldagainstterrorisme.com where there are a couple of big sections:<p>- SnitchTerrrorists, to report abnormal behaviour. Make it so that you can see which ethicity/religion has reported them. So people would realize that muslims don&#x27;t support extremist behaviour<p>- LiveTarget, witch the cooperation of America, an online live sattelite map that limits to Syria and the part that IS controls. Limit the visibility of known friendly groups ( eg. masking / using older images when a friendly plane crosses the land). So people in the world can unite and track down extremist behaviour in the IS country. Make it easy to report suspicious behaviour and you can bomb the hell out of them as soon as they get out of their building with the help of the community.<p>- The media should make fun with IS instead of addressing them as the big enemy. Make fun with the people who go there, target them as dumb ( if they had bad grades, ...) and change the public perspective for people who are compelled to go there because they hate where they live / feel discriminated because of social community problems<p>- I have another idea, but that is morely to protect western nations. That should be hidden from public eye ;) - contact me if you would like to know :P<p>Edit: If you&#x27;re down voting at least make a comment please, Eg. how you think states/nations can handle it &quot;better&quot;<p>My proposition are for the following intentions: less generalisation and less racisme ( not every muslim is IS! ), more public effort to help ( snitching extremists, finding IS members in their home country, ...), lessen the media appeal of IS for people with non-western feelings - living in Europe because of social problems in a country / community / city, ...",1447760843

We got to the conclusion NN can not beat the fastest solvers (PBF). This might change with the newest development of the hardware.<p>krapht - The feature vector is based on N-S equations, so there is a potential to approximate the solver to any precision<p>david_ar - We tried to analyze the model, and as for many learning approaches it seem kinda impossible to see what is going on.<p>fenomas - Instead of solving diff equations, we train a regression model, which predicts the same thing as a numerical solver.<p>lifeformed - any regression is a machine learning approach by definition<p>daniel-levin - at the time we wrote the paper, we were not sure about the generalization properties. We didn&#x27;t find any failure case either (if we did, we would just include such simulations in the training set). However, in the last week before the conference we tried various different forms of additional forces to simulate sand/ash/whatever and to do so we used the model trained only on water simulations. Surprisingly, it generalized quite well. However, not extrapolating outside the training set has some advantages - our method is stable and simply never diverges even if we try really hard.<p>irascible - after we do some optimizations (I guess it can be sped up by a factor of 10 or so) and finish/publish all kinds of other materials (smoke, fire, foam, elastic bodies, fractures, cloth, ..), we plan to do library, a plugin for Unity, etc and licence it",1447759699

Just as I am not qualified to have an opinion on anything to do with, for example, graphics programming, many people simply do not have the experience to have said qualification - not a judgement, simply a statement of fact.<p>Haskell certainly is not perfect nor is it likely the pinnacle of programming languages - however I don&#x27;t know a single person in reality who believes that to be the case. However this is exactly the persona a significant number of Haskell criticisms seems to attack.<p>So at the end of the day, when the majority of the criticism against the language is _fundamentally wrong_ in fact and based on false assumptions, it&#x27;s no surprise criticism isn&#x27;t as well accepted as with other communities.<p>Now having said all that, after spending a good part of the last two months actually endeavoring to learn Haskell and functional programming at a practical level - I can tell you there are MANY valid criticisms to be made, and the thing is, if you read Haskell mailing lists and other online communities, you&#x27;ll find that they constantly are being made and discussed rationally, the only difference is they are coming from people who are clearly familiar with the language, and the concepts they are discussing. These discussions, however, are far less interesting to any tech media because a.) they involve topics and terms few people are currently familiar with and b.) they aren&#x27;t abrasive or hostile, and that simply is _boring_ to the media.<p>One final comment - Haskell is not hard to learn, any reasonably skilled programmer willing to step outside their comfort zone could within a month be at a place where they would be qualified to critique the language. Which is the primary reason why it is so frustrating, at least to me, that so few people actually do before writing criticisms of the language.",1447758735

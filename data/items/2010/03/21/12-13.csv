1207903,comment,1207763,1207763,0,0,cstross,,,"Google is, in any event, an American corporation founded by Americans with American political values (specifically those of the liberal/socially libertarian west coast technosphere). ""Don't be evil"" is a <i>very</i> political agenda for a corporation in these days of profit maximization as the default setting, and Google -- by the nature of their business model -- also has a profit motive for maximizing uncensored communication.<p>So from the Chinese communist party point of view, it's absolutely correct to say that Google has a political agenda.<p>(The question of whose political agenda -- the Party's or Google's -- is <i>better</i> is (a) a value judgement and (b) utterly irrelevant to the question of whether Google's agenda is compatible with that of the Chinese ruling party.)",1269175883
1207902,comment,1207725,1207773,0,0,jagtesh,,,"swombat, everyone doesn't want to be an entrepreneur.<p>I'm an Indian, one who has lived in Bangalore for the past 6 years. I made a conscious choice of not working for an outsourcing outfit and instead plunged into the unknown realms of entrepreneurship. But I was lucky. I'm young with no dependents. No additional responsibilities other than taking care of myself. It's OKAY for me to get my hands burnt, because I know I'll survive to fight another day. On the other hand, many of my peers have their parents and siblings to take care of. Not to mention their own family if they're married. It's a big risk in India to lose a job and there are lesser financial instruments to aid the people (it's impossible to get a credit card without a job and the govt. doesn't pay anything to the employed, rather it _can't_).<p>Once you've lived under these circumstances, it's understandable to see a person who wants to work in a field they enjoy while having a sense of job security. Maybe because they have 10 years of experience in their fields, (which would pay them significantly more than Rs.350,000, esp. in _Bangalore_), a chunk of which goes into settling their EMIs. In such a case, jumping to a new field won't earn them as much while it could leave them stranded (there's little or no demand for non-Java/Oracle/BI Suite/.NET specialists here).<p>While I hope this give's a better insight into a Bangalore office worker's way of thinking, I do agree with your suggestions.",1269175832

1207898,comment,1207637,1207817,0,0,andrewcooke,,,"personally, i avoid places that require a facebook login because i want to avoid lock-in.  this isn't such a great example, because i doubt i would care about long term access to random strangers, but in general i want to be able to have access to sites without having to keep using facebook.  this is just a simple issue of access control - there's little advantage to me, and a big advantage to facebook, if they control my access to important services.<p>second, i am starting to be concerned about the ease with which <i>private</i> data on me can be pooled in one place.  i have a consistent public persona on the internet (i am usually the no 1 hit on searching for my name, for example), and i am fine with that.  however, in the past that has not included private conversations with other people.  google (gmail) and facebook are changing that, and starting to exploit access to data i have previously considered private.  so i am worrying about how to reduce the likelihood that this private data can be abused.  one way is to reduce the amount of data out there (so i have stopped using gmail).  another is to keep data isolated, which leads to me not wanting to use facebook logins ubiquitously (note that isolation works for private data, even as public data becomes more unified, as it cannot be pooled by a third party).  i am not saying that there is any current danger in you providing data to facebook, but i think there is a clear risk that things could progress in that direction (for example, in the future they might provide libraries/services that help with whatever your site does; that may lead to them managing data, and that data will be associated with a single identity).<p>[before anyone points out that email is not private, the distinction i am making here is a practical and graded one.  no single email is private, but the entire corpus is unlikely to be public knowledge]",1269175511

1207892,comment,1207721,1207721,0,0,dutchflyboy,,,"I disagree with this guy, every point he makes is flawed:<p>> Engineering components exist in the real world<p>Yes, and computers don't exist in some alternate dimension. People might forget it sometimes, but if you're a real engineer, you should know how a computer works, and know it's not magic, it's physics that make you're computer work. Software is merely an abstraction. Secondly, math is also engineering, but you can't touch it, can you?<p>> Engineering components interact in more predictable ways<p>No, wrong again. Software is perfectly predictable (BTW, if you want, you could build a mathematical model of every program. 100% predictable). If you make mistakes in other engineering branches you can get some strange results too.<p>> Engineering has fewer fundamental midcourse design changes<p>I don't see the link between engineering and design changes here. Are you trying to say that no single engineering project changes during it's life? Just look at prototypes of cars, those changes are quite massive. Secondly, ask yourself this question: How much does it cost to change a rocket design midway compared to a software program?<p>> Is software development a science?<p>Well, that's the point, in my opinion it's engineering.<p>> Writing software is more an art than an engineering discipline<p>Some think so, but really, it should be seen as engineering. Why? Artists make choices related to what they like, how they feel. Engineers make objective choices (or at least they should, nobody is perfect).<p>Rant finished!",1269174426

I also maintain that the largest reason behind the increasing and worrysome trend of downright lousy and inefficient software is due to it being ""engineered"", or should I say ""overengineered"", rather than just programmed. I blame a bad part of ""software engineering"" for this downwards spiral, but not ""software engineering"" itself, even if there's always a very clear distinction in what software was done by a programmer, and what software was made by an ""engineer"", with the latter pretty much always being the clunky and inefficient one.",1269174036

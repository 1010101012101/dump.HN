You could, for example install it, along with a couple friends, to help locate each other at a concert or some big festival (this is really handy), and shut off broadcasting, or just ditch it later. It doesn't need to violate privacy; you have the ability to broadcast your location when you want to be found, and only to whom you want to be found by.",1226220746
358195,comment,357857,358034,0,0,netcan,,,"I am not necessarily advocating an MBA. But this line of argument can probably be applied equally to many if not most degree courses. Especially applicable if you're talking about a degree at a 'better' university vs one that might be cheaper or where you may be eligible for scholarship.<p>If you want to learn most things there are probably better ways of achieving it. You can gain most knowledge almost free. But Universities give you a bundle of people, a framework, deadlines, teachers and the rest that amounts to something that people don't tend to get elsewhere. It also works without the highest possible level of motivation. While not glamorous, that's valuable.<p>As far as needing the knowledge, it's a judgement call. There are courses out there with more of a small business focus. It's definitely not a prerequisite, but taking time & resources & dedicating them to gaining knowledge in this area can produce value.",1226220731

Any that couldn't have been had two orders of magnitude cheaper if funded directly and not as a ""side effect""? Not that I'm against manned space flight or public funding of it.",1226220515

It's a non-sequiter that their oppositeness prevents either of them from being true, somehow forcing us to find some utilitarian compromise.<p>There are well-written defenses of both lasseiz-faire and marxist economics (although I think the former is vastly more defendable than the latter).

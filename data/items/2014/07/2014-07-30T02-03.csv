Collecting books from an author is like that, except that you&#x27;re also feeding the author, so they can write more books for you to read.  So you get 64,000 words in a book instead of 64 words in a tweet.<p>A lower starting price increases the initial pool of people who are exposed to an author&#x27;s fiction or non-fiction worldview.

8106144,comment,8104905,8105946,1,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t recall wanting to revisit most of my school books. Certainly not my elementary or jr. high school books. I did in college buy a used copy of a different version of the American history textbook I used in high school. So I think the utility is rather small.<p>Here&#x27;s a report on school text books in Ireland: <a href=""https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Education-Reports/School-Books-in-Ireland-Cost-to-Parents.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Education-Reports/S...</a><p>It&#x27;s from 1993, and exists because curriculum changes in the 1960s-1980s meant that the books, which in &quot;the early part of the century served students for generations, in some cases up to the 1960s&quot;, were now more freely selected by the teachers, while the parents pay the bill.<p>Some quotes:<p>&quot;Between 50% and 80% of books sold in certain subjects may be recycled. The volume of recycled books in circulation makes the cost of the annual book bill to parents difficult to estimate.&quot;<p>&quot;It is the conclusion of this Report that book rental schemes offer the most practical method of curtailing the cost of school books to parents in Ireland.&quot;<p>Related to this thread: &quot;Students were found to treat books with vastly different degrees of care within areas, schools, and classes, whether they owned the books or rented them.&quot; So no, ownership isn&#x27;t a key factor in how the books are treated.<p>Oh! Here&#x27;s a more recent report ( <a href=""http://www.barnardos.ie/assets/files/Advocacy/2012-School-Costs-Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.barnardos.ie/assets/files/Advocacy/2012-School-Co...</a> ), with details about the current cost breakdown. Regarding books, &quot;[t]he majority of parents are spending ... over €250 for a secondary school pupil.&quot; &quot;An ongoing criticism by parents has been the inability to pass books on between siblings due to new editions being prescribed by the teacher.&quot; &quot;The reliance on workbooks as a pupil resource is also often criticised by parents as being wasteful and expensive because they cannot be reused. &quot;<p>This suggests there is a non-trivial overhead to the secondary school book market in Ireland. (The hope is that the new the Code of Practice for the publishers may change that a bit.)<p>Even more info: <a href=""http://www.labour.ie/elenasecas/news/13983441786294822.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.labour.ie/elenasecas/news/13983441786294822.html</a> from April 2014 reports that &quot;20% of primary schools do not currently have book rental schemes&quot; and that a new €15m School Book Fund will provide seed capital to start them (the 1993 report talks about the need for such a fund). As a result, they expect to &quot;see the average book costs per child fall from about €100 per year, down to just €20.&quot;<p>This fits with my estimate of a 5 year depreciation schedule.<p>All of these suggest that purchasing books in Ireland is not &quot;much, much more affordable&quot;. However, I can&#x27;t find equivalent numbers for other countries, so I could be wrong.<p>Still, I get the idea that it isn&#x27;t as rosy as you paint it.<p>BTW, why do so many Irish schools require a school crest on their uniform? How do they justify that extra cost?",1406688595

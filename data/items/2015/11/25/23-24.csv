Medical security (within the scope of reasonable medical practices and expectations) and legal security (being able to mount a reasonable defense to occasionally quite unreasonable circumstances).<p>I&#x27;ve experienced the medical situation first hand.  And, it is a slippery slope.  Untreated or poorly treated -- or &quot;put off&quot; -- one problem can lead to second, and the next, and a spiraling decay of health.  And health is the foundation upon which all else is built.  It seems ridiculous that a society the professes to and insists upon &quot;the best&quot; from its members, makes so little concerted effort to foster that foundation.<p>And, unfortunately, in a society that seems to be increasingly focused on the self and attitudes centered around some sort of zero sum gain perspective, reasonableness and compromise seems to be supplanted with legal warfare.  Where, like all warfare, (personal) resources play a primary role in determining outcome.<p>There were things I wanted to achieve, but they were never focused on financial outcome, until I fell increasingly behind these eight balls.<p>Simple things -- the beauty of a day and place; good company; the comfort and well-being to fully enjoy these -- have always been the most enjoyable to me.  The creative focus and accomplishment I used to experience before the health issues increasingly limited it -- and it used to be strongest when what I did helped someone else.<p>I&#x27;ve had to rethink some of my early education and training -- and it has not been an easy course.  Because generosity, while still a primary force in the world at large, is NOT always reciprocated.  And these days, it is increasingly NOT a reliable rule in areas that have a primary, profound effect upon our lives.<p>And THIS, perhaps, is a real sign of decay in our society.  Or, I was raised under a delusion borne of some short-term aberration in how the world works.<p>Either way, I reflect more often on the adage:  You can&#x27;t take care of others until you&#x27;ve taken care of yourself.  Perhaps I still don&#x27;t want to consider that as primarily a financial dictate.  Neither, however, do I any longer wish to have financial constraints threaten my ability to take care of the basics in this regard, for myself or for my family.",1448495420

However, I contest that&#x27;s a design fault in the laptop, not the charger.<p>> which is of course far more expensive to replace than a new charger<p>Not always true.[1][2] DC jacks can often be bought for less than $5 online, and then it&#x27;s just labor to solder it into place. A search online turns out quite a few services for $75 inclusive of the DC jack cost (your local repair shop probably does it even cheaper now, since no shipping involved, etc). Apple&#x27;s cheapest adapter with magsafe cable on it is $79. A Thinkpad charger will only run you $59.99.[3]<p>> You&#x27;re bitching a lot about my evidence being anecdotal because it&#x27;s only based on hundreds of chargers, and you&#x27;re right, but your evidence appears to be based on, um, a single Dell charger that you think is awesome. That seems pretty weak.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to comment on this without resorting to some sort of &quot;fanboy&quot; argument.<p>> I think it&#x27;s stupid and a step backwards and I wish they had retained MagSafe on that model.<p>I think we both agree on this. Worse off, if that single port breaks, you now cannot charge your laptop, nor use any peripherals (and a peripheral is more likely to break that USB port than the charger in my experience - such as a USB thumb drive hanging out and someone smacks it on accident).

Some of these, like more expressive imports, seem pretty pointless given that we use IDE&#x27;s. But some of these are quite un-Javaish.<p>Structural typing would really go against the grain of the language, and i have a very hard time believing it would actually be useful. What method name is currently widely used with the same semantics across many classes, without being specified by an interface or base class? I can&#x27;t think of one. There used to be close(), but that&#x27;s been dealt with. Are there others?<p>Collection literals seem like a poor idea when there are so many different collection implementations. If i say:<p><pre><code>  List<Integer> list = {1, 2, 3};\n</code></pre>\nWhat kind of list do i get? ArrayList, as that&#x27;s the usual go-to? A foot-shooting opportunity for anyone doing concurrent programming! And a frustrating missed chance for anyone with a functional bent who would prefer an immutable list. Moreover, it seems unnecessary when you could easily just add constructors or factory methods like:<p><pre><code>  List<Integer> list = new ArrayList(1, 2, 3);\n  List<Integer> list = ArrayList.of(1, 2, 3);\n</code></pre>\nWhich leave the choice in the hands of the programmer for only a minimum of extra syntax.<p>Maps are a bit harder, because you need a way to describe pairs. In most projects i work on, i end up creating some helper methods that let me write:<p><pre><code>  Map<String, Boolean> map = map(entry(&quot;Java&quot;, true), entry(&quot;Go&quot;, false));\n</code></pre>\nAnd i wish there was a better syntax for that.<p>Something like algebraic data types would be good, though. You can already implement un-extendable classes using mild hacks:<p><pre><code>    public abstract class Shape {\n    \n        private Shape() {}\n    \n        public static class Circle {\n            public static Circle of(int radius) {\n                return new Circle(radius);\n            }\n    \n            public final int radius;\n    \n            private Circle(int radius) {\n                this.radius = radius;\n            }\n        }\n    \n        public static class Rectangle {\n            public static Rectangle of(int width, int height) {\n                return new Rectangle(width, height);\n            }\n    \n            public final int width, height;\n    \n            private Rectangle(int width, int height) {\n                this.width = width;\n                this.height = height;\n            }\n        }\n    \n    }\n</code></pre>\nBecause the constructors are all private, so putative subclass can&#x27;t call them.

Also plan some time for one of those more senior devs. Sit them down next to each other.<p>Point the junior to the readme. Ask the junior to ping / poke / bother the senior every time they hit a roadblock. Every single time. Ask them to be relentlessly persistent. (Not everyone&#x27;s good at being relentlessly persistent. So encourage them. Create an environment where they feel like they <i>can</i> be relentlessly persistent.) Then leave them alone.<p>Give it a day or two. Watch as interesting things start to happen.<p>Watch as the junior dev learns how to be a better communicator. Watch as they learn how to make problems visible. How to get help. And as an added bonus: how to program.<p>Watch as the senior dev goes insane at first from all the questions. Watch them start to wonder how they can avoid going through this every time somebody needs to touch their code. Watch them remove obstacles. Or at least reduce their number. Watch them automate things. Or speed up things that are already automated. Or improve processes in ways they had never even considered before sitting with the junior.

That homophobia is becoming socially backward and marginal is a wonderful thing. That <i>nobody can say something homophobic</i> is not.

But you should have the <i>freedom</i> to speak up, nevertheless. The choice should be yours.<p>We should also note that prior restraint and group-self-censorship aren&#x27;t going to change your co-worker&#x27;s opinions.

However, it&#x27;s subject to more pre-conviction scrutiny<p>No, its subject to <i>less</i> pre-conviction scrutiny than those charged with murders; at least, from the public defenders I&#x27;ve talked to, PDs assigned to homicides tend to be:<p>(1) the more experienced, skilled attorneys in the PDs office, and<p>(2) have the lowest caseloads, and thus the most time and resources to devote to each case.<p>That means that -- at least as regards those defendants relying on public defenders -- those charged with homicides have more effective representation to subject the prosecution to pre-conviction scrutiny. (For those <i>not</i> relying on public defenders, things may be different, but I suspect even there you&#x27;d find that the consequences faced means that more resources of those available to the defendant are devoted to the defense when the charge is murder, thus still subjecting the charges to greater pre-conviction scrutiny.)",1448492546

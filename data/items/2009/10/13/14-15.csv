They retire, not because they can't code any more, simply because the rate at which new stuff is generated outpaces their ability to internalize it.<p>To some extent I feel that programming is more and more about APIs and less about algorithms, which is where I thought the real fun was in designing software.<p>If I look at the guts of a piece of code written in the last decade or so, say a large framework, I see nothing but 'glue', the 'real' stuff is hidden so far underneath that people are almost unaware of it.<p>When you're building a web application in Django, for instance, then you have the following layers to go through in order to get some records from a database on to the screen of the end user:<p>- HTML<p>- template<p>- view code<p>- ORM<p>- python<p>- sql<p>- some database engine<p>- storage engine<p>- operating system<p>- device driver<p>- finally the hardware this all runs on<p>I call it the 'layercake', it's the closest analogy in the real world that I can find to how software is structured.<p>My 'comfort zone' is the one at which I can understand <i>all</i> of what I'm doing. There is no way to go and know <i>all</i> that is going on in a modern computer, there simply is too much code, and clock speeds are so high now that three seconds of computer time are more than you could possibly step through in a lifetime.<p>So, I'm operating on 'faith' most of the time now. And I find that hard. I have a strong tendency to 'reboot' my career every decade or so, to keep things fresh, strike out in to a path that I'm still completely clueless about to keep things interesting.<p>Whenever I do that the old stuff starts to look like 'new' again and I find that I can fan the fires for another decade or maybe a bit longer. I hope to keep this process going, but the programmers around me that were absolute aces in the 80's are now no longer able to keep up, one by one they fall back, lose interest and quit. Some go in to different fields (music seems to be popular, funny enough, in the 'coders at work' book there is L Peter Deutsch who became a full time composer), some just burn out completely and stop.<p>I wonder what is in my future. I've always been like a little child when it comes to programming, it gives me endless fascination to figure out stuff and to see what makes it tick. When I was three years old my father gave me a screwdriver and a typewriter he found at the garbage to take apart. I never stopped taking stuff apart (it took a while before I learned how to put stuff back together).<p>As for the memory thing, that's been a pretty scary experience, I don't know when I first became aware of it, it must have been last year or so, when I realized that there was stuff that I'd forgotten. Not that before I wouldn't forget stuff, but that only happened to things that I didn't want to remember, anything that I wanted to remember stayed put. It seems that that is no longer the case.

Plane accelerates, you get pushed back into your seat, surely there was some way of measuring that.<p>Obviously you can have a pendulum and measure the angle during take-off, but then you need a protractor, and a calculator that can take the tan of the angle, and it all seems very difficult.<p>Then I realised that if the pendulum hung on a ten by ten square, the marks across the bottom were effectively units of m/s^2.  45 degrees is 1 gee which is about 10m/s^2, and it's linear in the tan of the angle, etc, etc, so the system is effectively calibrated.<p>So take a piece of card, mark about 1/12 of the distance from the bottom top right corner up, replicate ten times, cut a notch, hang the pendulum from there.  Mark the same distance ten times across the bottom and hey presto, a callibrated plumb-bob accelerometer.<p>Now use during take-off.  (Yes, you do get some funny looks).  In the first 5 to 10 seconds the acceleration ramps up roughly linearly to reach about 3 m/s^2.  That's held for about 25 to 30 seconds, so all up we get:<p><pre><code>    V = 1/2*(5*3)+25*3\n      = 90m/s\n      ~ 160 kts.\n</code></pre>\nSpot on.<p>The result was really lucky, because in truth the plane bounces around and the pendulum swings wildly.  It's tough to dampen the swinging and get accurate measurements, but it's amazing how accurate it turns out.<p>For extra credit - roughly how much runway was used?<p>EDIT: All this was to rotation - not to take-off.

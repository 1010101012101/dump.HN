Without the low end to get rid of older stock and increase the yield, I could very well come that Nvidia and AMD aren&#x27;t able to keep the R&D dollars in GPUs.<p>Component manufacturers will start exclusively targeting consumer electronic companies, and the Off the shelf market may find that it is forced to pay premium prices, further reducing the number of people who are participating.<p>Unfortunately consolidation is a sign of a maturing market, with most people being happy with an off the shelf system (i.e. most people even on HN are happy with a macbook pro / air and its limited upgradability). A quad core laptop, 8gb of ram and 256gb SSD is suitable for most people, especially if they have a way of storing another 1tb of rarely used content (external hdd, NAS, online storage). They have been available for the past 3 years, and we are starting to get to the stage where they will likely be suitable for the next 3 as well.

A determined attacker could doubtless breach your front door with a battering ram or axe and enough time.  Part of the reason you don&#x27;t worry about this, I assert, is that it&#x27;s not likely because the costs to the attacker (in terms of chances of getting caught and penalties if they are) are too high.  Part of it, as you say, is that we have some amount of resiliency against the threats posed.  And probably part of it is that most of us are not terribly inclined to do damage to each other without provocation and there are many possible targets for the few who are - I&#x27;m not really sure the degree to which we should legitimately consider that bit a part of &quot;security&quot; but it certainly merits weight in calculating risks.",1386128259

It will deteriorate into Eternal September[3] -- filled with one line quips and memes.

As in, &quot;burning your engines in space almost never does what you&#x27;d intuitively expect based on a lifetime on Earth with things like cars and planes&quot; weird.<p>In order to get geostationary, you need to get to a circular orbit at an altitude of 35,786km above Earth&#x27;s surface. Trying to do that all in one burn is, I guess, theoretically <i>possible</i> but is going to waste an absurd amount of fuel.<p>The reason for this is that changing altitude in orbit = changing your speed. Specifically, you have two points you care about: your apogee (highest altitude) and your perigee (lowest altitude). To raise your apogee in the most efficient manner, you accelerate prograde (in the direction of your orbit), at perigee. To raise perigee in the most efficient manner, you accelerate prograde at apogee. Or, more simply: what you do at a certain point in your orbit will end up affecting what happens at the point in your orbit that&#x27;s precisely opposite the point where you did something.<p>So the most efficient way to get up there is to use a transfer orbit. First you get into a lower, &quot;parking&quot; orbit (which doesn&#x27;t take as much fuel as going all the way up in one go). Then at perigee you burn to raise your apogee out to the altitude you want. Then you cruise to apogee, and burn again to raise your perigee, resulting in a circular orbit.<p>Here&#x27;s a detailed article on that:<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit</a><p>Except it never goes quite that simply in the real world, so you actually end up doing more than two engine burns, but under ideal theoretical circumstances, you&#x27;d do it in two.",1386127504

And the one week deadline before pursuing &quot;more drastic remedies, such as contacting news media&quot; starts things in a confrontational, threatening manner.<p>If the aim was being helpful, a notice to Websmart first, and then to each other site individually, would have highlighted the problem without activating defensive egos.

6844785,comment,6829725,6831023,1,0,dancapo,,,"Scala has dependent type support, so, yes, it is quite more powerful than most languages in widespread use. You can look at the Shapeless library to see that at work.<p>However, that is not really what&#x27;s going on... though Scala type system, even without dependent types, is strictly more powerful that Java&#x27;s, it really comes down to the ease of use: Scala programmers tend to use types liberally (which was one of the criticisms of the article), and that is part of the &quot;magic&quot;.<p>Part of this is how easy it is to define a type: it can be as short as a single line. So you&#x27;ll see way less String types in Scala, for instance, or &quot;one type to do it all&quot; like the article wanted for HTTP. Instead, you get many types, in which invalid states are not possible and, therefore, getting the types right is enough to ensure there are no invalid states.<p>Likewise, the partial type inference offered by Scala makes it possible to <i>not worry</i> about all these types: the compiler knows what type you got, and knows whether it can be used the way you are using it, so you don&#x27;t have to keep looking up types to get things accomplished, but still get to have the types.<p>Another part is that Scala support higher order types, something not supported by Java, which makes them more useful. That&#x27;s what allows monads & companions come in and make an appearance -- it&#x27;s not that you can&#x27;t write a monad in Java, it&#x27;s just that you can&#x27;t abstract over them.<p>The final part is emphasis on immutability. When you stick to immutable objects representing valid states, the space for errors not caught by the type system is greatly reduced.<p>Let&#x27;s get back to the headers, then. First, yes, you are allowed to add arbitrary headers (which is supported by Spray through RawHeader, something it took me 30 seconds to find out, even though I have never used Spray and have little familiarity with it), but section 14 of RFC 2616 has a nice list of standard headers and the rules they are expected to abide by, so let&#x27;s have them.<p>And if you have a header, and it is a X-Forwarded-For, isn&#x27;t it reasonable to expect the value to be a valid remote address? It is <i>supposed</i> to be a valid remote address, after all. So, if you ask for this header, should you simply get a string that may or may not be actually valid, or should the type system give you an Option that may contain Some valid header, or None, therefore ensuring that you don&#x27;t just assume you are getting the right thing? And if you get something and retrieve the value, is it preferable to just get a string, that might lead to some ad hoc parsing of the address, or some actual type where you can easily retrieve information in a safe manner?<p>The Scala community will usually think that yes, that&#x27;s a good idea, and design the APIs accordingly.",1386127020

With many smaller companies, it is often ignorance. With many others, it is still too often the case that security concerns end up getting thrown in the &quot;yeah, we should fix that eventually&quot; pile of bugs.<p>Another issue is that security issues are often not visible to normal users. In the websmart example, a normal user looking for development services would have no idea that websmart has absolutely no clue how to do security. So, websmart gets the business, while the client gets a ticking time bomb, without even knowing it.<p>That, and most developers don&#x27;t have any formal training in security concerns. I know I didn&#x27;t when I first started - I had to pick it up as I went. It does not surprise me that these sorts of things keep coming up. Unless something changes - e.g. the majority of computer science degree programs include a course or two on security, I don&#x27;t expect things to get drastically better.<p>That said, things like bug bounty programs help raise the visibility.

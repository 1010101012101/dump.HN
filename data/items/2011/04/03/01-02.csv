I looked it up the last time there was a big thread about this on HN. Pinker bases most of that chapter on the work of Eric Turkheimer, as his bibliographic references should show. And Eric Turkheimer has substantially revised his opinion about what heritability studies mean after continuing his research and thinking about the data more.

I marked Omnidrive as deadpool in CrunchBase, and it isn't uncommon for Techcrunch to not cover a story that has been covered elsewhere, esp since Mike was an investor and was wary of conflicts ...""</i><p>My tone is skeptical Nik because I read stories, information and posts with my <i>BS</i> detection at maximum when I detect ambiguity.<p>I'm interested in ambiguous stories because it's possible to find in them both the truth but sometimes non-truths. Take for instance a story which I posted on HN 3 years ago, <i>""The Google Way: Give Engineers Room""</i>. [0] I posted the story because it was interesting. But it took a fellow HN'r Karzeem [1] to suggest something wasn't quite right. You can read the post for yourself. I wasn't thinking Google is bad or looking for subterfuge by the New York times. But that's what we got. I emailed the New York times for clarification and it turns out because the story was in fact a <i>""Submarine""</i>. A plant by Google and the Times to make Google <i>appear</i> a great place to work in the guise of an interview. Except it wasn't. You can read it yourself on HN.[2] karzeem and myself agreed this was a great article not because of the content, but because it exposed the mechanism the Times could paid placement as stories by hiding it in the <i>Fashion</i> section (not the hard news section) and how Google positions itself.<p>The story behind the closure of Omnidrive is ambiguous.<p>I first picked up the inconsistencies when an article in a conservative local business magazine, BRW mentions Omnidrive not only in the top 100 Web 2.0 companies in Australia, but in the top 50.[3] How could this be? Omnidrive for all intensive purposes was in the deadpool? So I contacted Renai LeMay a local journalist who worked at ZD Net to ask, <i>""why was Omnidrive inclused?""</i>. His reply Omnidrive was active. Timing matters here. I asked LeMay in 2008JUL08 but the deadpool lists Omnidrive as <i>""officially closed in September of 2008""</i> [4][5][6] Which is it? The duplicity makes me think the ambiguity was for a reason. It might not be, but I'm suspicious. Is it possible in the ambiguity in this story was used as a smoke screen for other reasons?<p><pre><code>    As the major investor in Omnidrive I am stunned not to have received any \n    information from Nik on what’s been happening over the last few months. \n    I have emailed him a number of times, but have not had a single reply. \n    The last I heard he was flying around the world, after launching \n    Techcrunch IT, and also building the Techcrunch tablet for Michael \n    Arrington. [7]\n</code></pre>\nI'll let you, the reader ponder the reasons for ambiguity by pointing you to Clay Cook, a fellow Australian and ex-angel.[8] I follow through with stories like the closure of Omnidrive, not because I have any particular interest in Omnidrive or (you) Nik, but for reasons of clarity. If I read a story with a degree ambiguity, I like the clarify the reasons why, to analyse and understand. If a statement is made, test for it's validity against what I know. Will it stand up to a degree of scrutiny? I like follow-up posts like this because I think it's a good real-life lesson for fellow HN's to not take information at face value. Startups are by their nature complex but fragile things that constantly fall over and fail.<p><pre><code>    Lesson: Your investors are here to help you, keep them informed \n            and you have a much higher likelihood of receiving help. [9]\n</code></pre>\nThey are run by optimistic, risk taking individuals who like take charge with technology, who value making new things and maybe, just maybe short circuit the <i>""money-problem""</i>. The trip from technologist to entrepreneur to successful entrepreneur is complex and requires many skills, technical and personal. I think the most important skill to foster is to <i>""be-good""</i>.<p><i>""Be good""</i>, not to be virtuous, be good because the algorythm is stateless and as a strategy, it works.

It shows; my daughter has an insatiable curiosity that, according to Gladwell, is a direct result of how we’re raising her.<p>Having recently devoured a bunch of the works of Steven Pinker, I question this. If their daughter is naturally curious, it could be inherited rather than learned. In ""The Blank Slate"" Steven Pinker has an entire chapter on children. There he says that all studies that try to figure out what styles of parenting lead to what results, none of them control for heritability. They simply assume that the child's behavior due to styles of parenting. But what if curious parents lead to curious children because of their genes, and not their style of parenting? Pinker goes on to argue that what the evidence shows is that the style of parenting has absolutely no long-term effect on a person's behavior. Instead, what matters is genes, culture (in particular the child's peers), and chance events.",1301794624

The original piece is sad and I pity the author for his loss of pride and idealism. Lets see how we can turn this into a message of hope ...<p><pre><code>                  Some rules kids won't learn in school\n                        Text By Charles J. Sykes\n\n                   Printed in San Diego Union Tribune \n                           September 19, 1996\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, there are some things that children should be learning in school, but don't. Not all of them have to do with academics. As a modest back-to-school offering, here are some basic rules that may not have found their way into the standard curriculum.<p>First off, lets get rid of 'rules.' These are one mans observations on life and don't hold true for everyone, or all the time.\n---\nRule No. 1: Life is not fair. Get used to it. The average teen-ager uses the phrase, ""It's not fair"" 8.6 times a day. You got it from your parents, who said it so often you decided they must be the most idealistic generation\never. When they started hearing it from their own kids, they realized Rule No. 1.<p>The better the world is, the more fair it seems. The world should be fair. But that's not what the author is talking about. The lesson that children don't learn is that it is very difficult to distinguish personal desire from objective fairness. For example, it's not fair that I was born to smart parents, or that I have a nice job and a nice house. But I rarely take the time to consider the gross unfairness of this situation because it benefits me. Learning to see when things are unfair because the world needs to be improved, and when you feel wronged because your desires aren't met is a skill most teenagers lack.\n---\nRule No. 2: The real world won't care as much about your self-esteem as much as your school does. It'll expect you to accomplish something before you feel good about yourself. This may come as a shock. Usually, when inflated self-esteem meets reality, kids complain it's not fair. (See Rule No. 1)<p>There is no such thing as the real world, there is only the one world after all :) In fact those people that love you will always want you to feel good about yourself. What the author is identifying is not that life outside of school is uncaring, it's that it is much harder. Problems that you deal with in school arn't problems at all, they've already been solved. They are tests. Outside of school you'll see real problems and if you've never faced a real problem it can be traumatic. Failing at hard things is very common and students might not be used to it. \n---\nRule No. 3: Sorry, you won't make $40,000 a year right out of high school. And you won't be a vice president or have a car phone either. You may even have to wear a uniform that doesn't have a Gap label. Cute anachronisms aside there is much more to this point that should go into an education. Given early academic choices what can you expect from the job market? There are well documented statistics, and if you graduate from school without an awareness of these, you're in trouble. Your degree in philosophy will put you at the Gap, but your CS degree will probably have a better return.\n---\nRule No. 4: If you think your teacher is tough, wait 'til you get a boss. He doesn't have tenure, so he tends to be a bit edgier. When you screw up, he's not going to ask you how you feel about it.<p>This observation makes me very sad. What life circumstances forced this man to endure uncaring leadership? Almost every boss I've had did care about me and wanted to know how I was doing, knew the importance of moral and emotional health, and had my back in a crunch. The rule here is if your boss doesn't fit that description and you have any choice at all, leave and leave fast.\n---\nRule No. 5: Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grand-parents had a different word of burger flipping. They called it opportunity. They weren't embarrassed making minimum wage either. They would have been embarrassed to sit around talking about Kurt Cobain all weekend.<p>Pride is a powerful thing. Flipping burgers should be beneath <i>anyone's</i> dignity. They should be so mad at having to flip burgers that they will do anything, go to great lengths so that they don't have to anymore. Maybe they will even invent an automated way to flip burgers :)\n---\nRule No. 6: It's not your parents' fault. If you screw up, you are responsible. This is the flip side of ""It's my life,"" and ""You're not the boss of me,"" and other eloquent proclamations of your generation. When you turn 18, it's on your dime. Don't whine about it, or you'll sound like a\nbaby boomer.<p>Again I feel bad for this guy, somewhere along the way he lost his support network and grew a highly jaded skin. Parents are there to catch you when you fall, if your 5, 10, or 50. The only job a parent has is to see the success and continuation of their offspring. People who don't feel this way shouldn't be parents in the first place. Great parents however will never need to do this though because children destined for happy lives and great things take pride in personal ability, accomplishment, and independence. Being an adult means that you don't need to ask for help very often but you arn't afraid to when you do. It's a very hard line to walk and that's the lesson children often miss.\n---\nRule No. 7: Before you were born your parents weren't as boring as they are now. They got that way paying your bills, cleaning up your room and listening to you tell them how idealistic you are. And by the way, before you save the rain forest from the blood-sucking parasites of your parents'\ngeneration, try delousing the closet in your bedroom.<p>If you resent your children it unlikely you're going to be a good parent. Now I feel bad for this guy and his kids.\n---\nRule No. 8: Your school may have done away with winners and losers. Life hasn't. In some schools, they'll give you as many times as you want to get the right answer. Failing grades have been abolished and class valedictorians scrapped, lest anyone's feelings be hurt. Effort is as\nimportant as results. This, of course, bears not the slightest resemblance to anything in real life. (See Rule No. 1, Rule No. 2 and Rule No. 4)<p>A few things matter in life. Winning and losing are not part of that set. Being able to accomplish your goals is important, but if you're playing a game where the only way for you to win is for someone else to lose ... YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME, and whatever it is doesn't really matter. Life is not a zero sum game.\n---\nRule No. 9: Life is not divided into semesters, and you don't get summers off. Not even Easter break. They expect you to show up every day. For eight hours. And you don't get a new life every 10 weeks. It just goes on and on.\nWhile we're at it, very few jobs are interesting in fostering your self-expression or helping you find yourself. Fewer still lead to self-realization. (See Rule No. 1 and Rule No. 2.)<p>I can't begin to articulate how saddening this mindset makes me, and I'm glad I don't suffer from it. Every day is an opportunity to reinvent yourself and the thing holding you back from doing so ... that's probably fear. Look hard at whatever you think it is, it' probably fear masquerading as knowledge.\n---\nRule No. 10: Television is not real life. Your life is not a sitcom. Your problems will not all be solved in 30 minutes, minus time for commercials. In real life, people actually have to leave the coffee shop to go to jobs. Your friends will not be as perky or pliable as Jennifer Aniston.<p>Sure, but how about ""Don't watch T.V."" That's a rule I think we could all live with.\n---\nRule No. 11: Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them. We all could.<p>Teh lolz.\n---\nRule No. 12: Smoking does not make you look cool. It makes you look moronic. Next time you're out cruising, watch an 11-year-old with a butt in his mouth. That's what you look like to anyone over 20. Ditto for ""expressing yourself"" with purple hair and/or pierced body parts.<p>First part I'm all for, but the second? I'm terribly vanilla, but if you really want purple hair and piercings, go for it! That stuff grows back. In the spirit of the rule lets go with ""Tatoos are probably a bad idea."" Why? Because they last and last and last, and the impulse that made you get it will fade. On the other hand, if you consider your body a canvas, remember you only get one and having a master plan before you start couldn't hurt.\n---\nRule No. 13: You are not immortal. (See Rule No. 12.) If you are under the impression that living fast, dying young and leaving a beautiful corpse is romantic, you obviously haven't seen one of your peers at room temperature lately.<p>Actually is is terribly romantic, it is fantastic, it is totally selfish. Once you're dead, that's it. The rest of us have to go on living, so have a care for us ok?\n---\nRule No. 14: Enjoy this while you can. Sure parents are a pain, school's a bother, and life is depressing. But someday you'll realize how wonderful it was to be a kid. Maybe you should start now.<p>And to all the different ones, ""It gets better."" Being an adult is a hell of a lot more fun for us than being a kid ever was.",1301794287

These attract double taxation <i>but</i> this is not particularly onerous. Bear in mind that there are no ""state"" income taxes in the UK. There's one system, one set of rules, so on a £150k profit, the company would pay 20% corporation tax, and then the remainder split however many ways would attract personal dividend tax from each person. Thanks to a tax credit you get (to help counteract the corporation tax) the <i>basic</i> rate of dividend tax is effectively 0% (then you pay higher bands based on the dividend added to your normal income).<p>It's not exactly 1 + 1 = 2 territory, but it's a single system that any business owner or small-time bookkeeper can look up and feel confident about doing the calculations for.<p><i>Third, the US doesn't have the UK's system of rules requiring qualified directors; for instance, a bankruptcy in the US can't prevent you from being a principal in a company.</i><p>Yes, but this is an issue of personal bankruptcy which only lasts for 12 months (and potentially less). It's now common to take out an IVA (Individual Voluntary Arrangement) to avoid bankruptcy. Flipping it around, the UK doesn't have the US's system of ""accredited investors"" meaning that investment opportunities are open to more people ;-)<p><i>Fourth, isn't it more expensive to incorporate in the UK than it is in the US?

UK employees need to be given reasonable notice or compensation prior to termination; the UK is also not an ""at-will"" employment regime, making it harder to fire and thus harder to hire employees.</i><p>Yeah, there is some of this. However, a British company doesn't have any pressure to sort out health benefits and the legal costs are a lot lower (and the risk of getting sued for this and that seems to be somewhat lower based on the US and UK companies I know). So it's swings and roundabouts, as we say.<p>While ""at will"" employment is not (legally) done in the UK, it's not a particularly onerous system for businesses as long as they are careful. The notice period for an employee who's been with you for under 2 years is only a week, for example. For someone under a month, there's no notice period. As long as you aren't sloppy or outright discriminatory, you shouldn't be getting hauled in front of an employment tribunal.<p><i>you might have gotten a distorted idea of what the regs in the US actually are.</i><p>I did say it was subjective ;-) But I think a lot of it comes from the way in which the US has a plethora of particularly local laws. England, on the other hand, is more equivalent to a state and the laws across England are generally one and the same. Scotland has its own legal system but no-one in England would think to incorporate there (or in France, Germany, or wherever) in the way Americans incorporate across states.<p>Perhaps if people stuck to their own local states and were aware of their local laws, the situation would not be any more complex than in the UK.

I'm going to have to short your stock though. The Midwest at this time and possibly forever can't compete against the coasts for the types of startups project skyway is looking for. They have more quality talent for web/mobile/social/etc. They have more advanced networks and streamlined capitalization. They also have founders going on startup three, four, five and not all successful. If I had a web/mobile/social/etc startup or saw myself being a founder of one, the first thing I would do is move. The statistics of success dictate such.<p>Things brings up a problem see with project skyway. You are left funding founders not dedicated enough to their startups to move and give their startups the best chance. I would have serious reservations about investing in such a founder.<p>Incumbators were great even two years ago but now they really aren't as necessary. Thanks to Angel List you don't have to pay an accelerator for access to the network. In the world of Angel List an accelerator is actually a decelerator. If you have an idea for a startup, get a prototype done and submit it to Angel List. If it's got merit, you'll get interest. If not, move onto something else.  I view project skyway more as a founder school that you pay with equity rather than an accelerator. I wish it would market itself as such.<p>The Midwest can kick the coasts' ass any day of the week but not with the type of companies project skyway wants. It's with the type of companies it specifically doesn't want.<p>I wish project skyway the best (that's Minnesota nice for I don't think it will work).",1301793358

Granted, they're busy, but many of them overplay their busyness and take a fairly myopic approach of if-I-can't-get-it-in-thirty-seconds-it-must-not-work. That's not true. Some problems worth solving are actually complex and require time to understand, somewhere between 30 seconds and an hour.<p>My solution has been to do as much as possible without their money.",1301793247

In the case you have growing revenue have hundreds of clients, and you just want to blow up at that point there should be no reason for any angel to turn you down.

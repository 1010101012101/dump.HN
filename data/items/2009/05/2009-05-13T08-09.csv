Many open source libraries have been developed by dozens of very smart people over many years, do you really think your solution will be better?",1242204996
606656,comment,606363,606598,0,0,intranation,,,"Regular expressions are overkill in most cases, and clutter the code. Do you really always know you need a 6 character long integer in a URL? what you really want is an ID, which <i>may</i> be a 6 character integer. Simple keyword-based routing is fine for 99% of cases.",1242204860
606655,comment,606363,606363,0,0,intranation,,,"I really like Juno. It's very small, and quite elegant, and it mostly feels like Python (rather than a DSL-ish framework). My only issues are that the URLs are tightly coupled to the controllers--from a stylistic point of view I prefer to manage the URLs in a single place (since they're both related but different).",1242204785

606642,comment,606567,606567,0,0,Steve0,,,"I first thought this would let you simulate your arduino. This isn't the case, it's a sketch-only tool.<p>From the faq: 
Does Fritzing simulate my circuit, like, does an LED actually blink if I plug it in?
    No, sorry. We don't think that the advantage of having a simulation is worth the effort. Hardware is very difficult to simulate and it would also complicate the usage of Fritzing. Also, we think that it is important that you get hands on with the real stuff, and that you should try out your circuits physically. We will however add some simple checks in the future, to help you avoid common mistakes.",1242203636

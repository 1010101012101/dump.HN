Apologize for repeats)<p>1. Similar to other suggestions, but with a slight twist, modify the up/down votes to utilize the Net Promoter Score methodology. It has its issues but it reduces a really difficult problem to a simple question that provides a broader spectrum than y/s. Could limit the ""would highly recommend"" super-vote to one story per day so users would save those votes for those articles they find extremely valuable.<p>Actually, thinking about it. Would be cool to get a view of only stories that people have ""spent"" their one super-vote as that is signaling extreme importance. I think many people find many stories interesting, but would only find a few EXTREMELY interesting enough to spend their super-vote on.<p>2. One challenge is that HN has grown in size so much that there is no set of top stories to satisfy the entire group. Would be interesting to provide a view that matches your personal preferences. Reddit does this by subreddit, stackoverflow by tags. My personal background is personalization in the context of eCommerce, which looks more at user segments.

I chose a degree in which I will eventually be making a lot of money, but for now I definitely feel like that debt is looming over me, it is holding me back from doing what I want to do (get a newer car, my beater is really on its last legs), find a place to live on my own rather than with 4 room mates.<p>It hasn't given me the freedom yet to purchase new tools and equipment for my woodworking hobby.

Wouldn't that save a large number of code points?<p>Their reply:<p>A: The Han ideographic script is largely compositional in nature. The overwhelming number of characters created over the centuries (and still being coined) are made by adjoining two or more old characters in simple geometric relationships. For example, the Cantonese- specific character U+55F0  was created by adjoining the two older characters, U+53E3  and U+500B , one next to the other.<p>The compositional nature of the scriptand, more to the point, the fact that this compositional nature is well-knownmeans that over time tens of thousands of ideographs have been created, and these are currently encoded in Unicode by using one code point per ideograph. The result is that some 71,000 code points are consumed by ideographs in Unicode 5.0, nearly three-quarters of the characters encoded.<p>The compositional nature of the script makes it attractive to propose a compositional encoding model, such as can be used for Hangul. Such a mechanism would result in the savings of thousands of code points and relieve the IRG from the burden of having to examine potential candidates for encoding.<p>Unfortunately, there are some difficulties involved with a compositional model for Han.<p>First of all, while the rules for drawing composed Jamos as Hangul syllables are relatively straightforward, those for Han are surprisingly complex. To use U+55F0  as an example again, although it is built structurally out of two pieces, the left piece occupies far less than 50% of the character's horizontal space. This reduction in size is a result of the nature of U+53E3  itself and doesn't apply to other characters. Either the rendering process would have to be sophisticated enough to take such ideographic idiosyncrasies into account, or the encoding model would have to provide more information than just the geometric relationship between the composing pieces. (This is the main reason why the existing Ideographic Description Sequence mechanism is inadequate even for drawing described ideographs.)<p>Even more difficult is the problem of normalization, which would be necessary for operations such as comparison or searching. A normalization algorithm would first have to parse the sequence of composing Han for validity, and then make sure that all substrings are normalized. It should also to be able to recognize a ""canonical"" form for a sequence of composing Han. Thus, U+55F0  could be spelled using three pieces (U+53E3 , U+4EBB , U+56FA ) as well as with two. Indeed, since U+4EBB  is a well-known variant form of U+4EBA , it could be spelled using that character, as well. Providing a canonical representation would have to take these multiple spellings into account.<p>The open-ended nature of the script and possibilities for ambiguous spelling make it virtually impossible to guarantee that two characters made up by two different people would be treated as equivalent even if they look exactly the same and are intended to be equivalent.<p>Other computer processes such as machine-based translation or text-to- speech would probably have to skip such characters when they occur in plain text, because there is no simple, authoritative way for these processes to be able to determine even approximate definitions or pronunciations from the visual representation alone. Even if the data are available, the need to parse strings of variable length before looking them up creates complications.<p>Finally, East Asian governments, while aware of the compositional nature of the script, do not wish to actively encourage the coining of new forms because of the practical problems they create. In particular, new coinages are rarely an aid to communication, since they have no obvious inherent meaning or pronunciation. They are little more than dingbats littering otherwise intelligible text.<p>While the number of encodable ideographs has proven far greater than Unicode had originally anticipated, the standard is in no danger of running out of room for them any time soon. 71,000 ideographs encoded in 17 years amounts to just over 4000 ideographs per year. At this rate, it would take nearly two hundred years to fill up the available space in Unicode with ideographs.<p>And while the number of unencoded but useful ideographs is larger than originally anticipated, it is also finite and probably smaller than the number of ideographs already encoded. The bulk of useful unencoded forms is likely to come from placenames, personal names, or characters needed for Chinese dialects other than Mandarin and Cantonese. Many unencoded forms occurring in existing texts are actually variants of encoded characters and would best be represented as such.<p>While it currently takes several years for the IRG to fully process proposed ideographs so that they can be encoded, steps are being taken to streamline this, and further steps will be possible in the future should they prove necessary. Indeed, the bulk of the work currently done by the IRG would still have to be done for composed ideographs in order to provide support for them beyond rendering.",1302578373

YC Rejects would be disclosing more than they want to do a startup and in fact it's been noted that the angel would review applicants and determine who gets in.<p><i>The problem is that the prior probability that you're good is already low, not that the conditional probability that you're good given that you're rejected by YC is any lower.</i><p>Based on what exactly?  Why is it more likely that your not good to begin with?<p><i>So the real question here is, can these people learn to first evaluate their applicants, and then support the ones they fund, anywhere near as well as YC does?  I think the YC formula is nit going to be anywhere near as easy to duplicate as they seem to think.</i><p>It doesn't have to <i>duplicate</i> the YC formula in order to be successful as even YC proves that their formula doesn't automatically lead to successful startups.  I do think that the YC staff and alumni network is a huge asset but that doesn't preclude others from providing valuable resources.  The rest remains to be seen.",1302577314

You don't need the CS degree to be a programmer and the E.E. degree would be enough to show that you got the brains.<p>As for start-up building, all the more reason to give it a go.  As with anything, you learn by doing.  You know nothing about building your ideas, but once you take a shot you learn a lot more about it.  You don't need to shoot for the stars.  Try something small.",1302577297
2435665,comment,2435408,2435408,15,0,VengefulCynic,,,"The problem here is that the mathematics education industry is bought and paid for by educational vendors in general and Texas Instruments in particular.  My wife's school has its own TI Vendor who makes sure to come by every month or two with free goodies for the teachers (and frequently hosts events with free drinks for the teachers and give-aways, including free calculators.)  TI also has an educator conference that it encourages member schools to pay for teachers to attend.<p>In return, the school pays for classroom sets of calculators, training for teachers and proprietary software and hardware that interfaces directly with the calculator for use in math and science classes.  Given the number of high school math textbooks with extra sections for use with calculators and recommendations of a particular brand of calculator, it's hard to imagine that TI isn't marketing to the textbook companies as well.<p>With regards to education, the involved parties operate much like Oracle and the other ""complete systems"" vendors in the enterprise world: buy influence with the decision-makers and their subordinates, keep up the hard sell until the contract is won and then maintain the sell to ensure future business.  That's not to say that the educational vendors give bad customer service, but at the same time, providing the end-users (the students) with a quality product at a reasonable price is hardly the primary concern.",1302577258

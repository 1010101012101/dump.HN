149740,comment,149482,149482,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"The best way to do this, is whatever idea you have, try and build it using Ruby on Rails.  You may make some mistakes, but the best thing about Rails is that many of the architectural decisions are made for you.  You only really need to worry about the syntax once you get the hang of it.<p>Lots of the other advice on here, about learning C, and SICP, and emacs and CS fundamentals is nice but not necessary. Learning it will be very hard for an absolute newbie to get anything out of.  It could demoralize you.<p>Thats why I'd advise to actually start building whatever it is you have a startup idea for.  It will give you traction.  You will definately struggle, but at least you'll have something concrete to show for your efforts.  And I'd use Rails.   If you run into problems you can always go the rubyonrails IRC channel or even ruby-lang.  You'll get the hang of it.  If you are going to take this route I'd recommend the Rails book by DHH.",1206833457

149734,comment,149317,149317,0,0,npk,,,"Learning electronics was much, much, harder for me than programming.  Electronics seemed magical.  I couldn't break complex circuits into the little components, circuits didn't seem to be built hierarchically.  I felt like, if a circuit designer wrote code, you'd have one big function with no loops and minimal branching.  First thing to keep in mind -- that's not true.  It's just hard to see the components until you get familiar with them.<p>But, to answer your question.  You _need_ The AoE.  Read it over and over and over again.  Look at Forrest Mims books.  Your local technical library should have some.<p>The most important thing (not mentioned) is your lab.  Mims books basically beg you to build his circuits.  At minimum, a power supply and multimeter.  Consider adding an oscilloscope* and function generator.  I have a lab at home, basically everything purchased off of ebay, it's great.  You'll need components.  These are expensive, I have several bins of components at home.  Handy to have when you think of an experiment to perform.  If you live in the bay area, go to weirdstuff warehouse.  You could film wargames 2 in that place.<p>If you really don't want to invest in a lab, an alternative (might) be the software package ""multisim.""  Multi-sim lets you hook stuff up in software, and simulate the output.  I've heard this tool helps students learn circuit design.  But I've never used it.<p>good luck<p>* Just learning how an oscillscope works, and how to use it will teach you more than you can imagine :)",1206833065

149727,comment,149482,149482,0,0,rcoder,,,"If you're hoping to get into web development, then you'll need to learn quite a lot of pieces of technology. For a professional, the minimum knowledge base is TCP/IP networking, HTTP, HTML, Javascript, the DOM, SQL, a bit of UNIX shell, and at least one general-purpose programming language like Python, Ruby, or PHP.<p>As a hobbyist, you can start smaller than that, of course. Learning HTML and a bit of Javascript is a great start -- if you can build simple client-side dynamic apps, moving into server-side scripting is a lot easier. Configuring a basic Linux server to host web applications (even if it's just a virtual machine, or a spare PC under your desk) is a big step forward, too.<p>As an economist who <i>may</i> want to do some web development, though, you might gain as much from learning a general-purpose language like Python as you will from web development. Being able to toss out a quick script to do your simulations or mine an existing data set may prove substantially more valuable to you than an in-depth understanding of PHP and Apache configuration.",1206832519

I&#x27;m not sure how this applies to private homes or the US, but I recall architects preventing functional modifications of public structures in several cases in Germany.

Then there&#x27;s often specs, based on what your business is exactly doing. 
That&#x27;s why we decided to have a focus on food delivery at first, because we can answer every need you may have, from online ordering (adding pickup and catering) to customer relationship and promotion(adding yelp or G+ reviews) to what the drivers need to know regarding their delivery for that specific.<p>Meanwhile we&#x27;ve built our solution in a flexible way, and with an API, because a lot of things that we&#x27;ve built take a lot of time and expertise and we know other delivery businesses need it too. (And it&#x27;s often hard to realize it before you actually start building it in house...)<p>So objectively if I had to start a food delivery business, I would use Trackin (obviously), and if it was a different service, I&#x27;d still use a (good) E-commerce solution + an API from a trustable 3rd party to help me manage the deliveries. That could be Trackin on something different based on your needs.
A company with a product that will evolve faster that my own product and would save me 2-3+ full time engineers and 6month at least.<p>You can still do it yourself but in the end you&#x27;ll be building a dashboard, with a catalog, inventory, delivery management, dispatch, driver app then a customer facing app VS only build a customer facing app, and get the rest from a Saas, customize it so that you can focus on your business.
What I like to consider is the following: Why would I spend $$ and time on something for my business if I can have a competitor doing the same thing as me in just a couple of days/weeks thanks to SaaS solutions? Where will be the value added of your business?<p>Hope that helps and happy to discuss more if needed!",1429642162

That said we have a high number of JS files (that I am slowly pruning down) so it was a worry (time-wise it takes ~30 sec to transpile all our JS) to run them all through babel. I considered trying to add a:<p><pre><code>  &quot;use babel&quot;;
</code></pre>
at the top of files that should be transpiled but I couldn&#x27;t find a good &quot;gulp way&quot; to check for that. I also considered using a &quot;filename.es6.js&quot; structure but following file renames in SVN is a bitch and a half (not my only reason) so I didn&#x27;t want to have to change those all back when es6 was widespread enough to use directly. I settled on running them all though so our &quot;gulp build&quot; takes 30 seconds or so but for our &quot;gulp watch&quot; (which starts off by building everything) I implemented caching so that only changed files had to be re-transpiled before getting concated into our &quot;app.js&quot; file. With this change it takes <1sec to transpile changed JS. Since our JS dev&#x27;s use &quot;gulp watch&quot; everything works out quite nice so that they can edit a file and reload their browser to see the change immediately (30 sec times would have killed babel in it&#x27;s crib for us and I assume most other places).<p>For caching we used the gulp-cached [0] plugin. It&#x27;s important to note that if you plan on concat-ing your files that you are caching then you will also need to use gulp-remember [1] which re-introduces cached files into your file stream after the intensive parts of are done so for example:<p><pre><code>  var customJSStream = gulp.src(&#x27;webroot/source/js/**/*.js&#x27;))
  	.pipe(cache(&#x27;app-custom-js&#x27;))
  	.pipe(babel())
  	.pipe(remember(&#x27;app-custom-js&#x27;))
  ...
</code></pre>
(NOTE: I&#x27;ve left out stuff from our gulpfile and simplified it for display here)<p>We then combine that stream with 2 others and concat them all together but that&#x27;s not important for this example. Let me know if you have any other questions!<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cached"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cached</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-remember"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-remember</a>",1429641145

Only Fox News believes that.<p>You clearly haven&#x27;t read Piketty&#x27;s book.  Among other things, he has excellent data from several countries showing most of all wealth is inherited.  Some 70% in France, over 50% in the U.S.  That is, in France, for every 100 euros of wealth of any type whatsoever, 70 of those were inherited from one&#x27;s parents.  In the U.S. for every $100 of any sort of wealth whatsoever, over $50 was inherited from one&#x27;s parents.  Most of all wealth is inherited, not worked for.<p>By definition, dynastic wealth shifts around a bit.  A billion into this trust (dedicated for grandchildren and great-grandchildren), a billion into that trust dedicated for maintenance of the family&#x27;s real estate holdings.  A given individual may fall in or out of limited rankings such as the Forbes 400.  But so what?  The 493rd richest person in America is still very very rich, and will remain so until that person decides to distribute their wealth to their heirs (and for that matter, moving out of the top 400 may have been due to providing for the heirs).<p>There are also lots of studies about income mobility.  The U.S. has lower income mobility than most nations.  In general, if you are born poor, you&#x27;re quite unlikely to ever reach the top quintile of income.  (The top quintile of household income in the U.S. is just over $100K, which I suspect many Silicon Valleyers wouldn&#x27;t even call &quot;rich&quot;.)<p>So one way to write this would be: if you are born poor, you are very unlikely to ever live in a household where there are two earners that each earn a bit over $50K.  About 8% of those born poor will ever reach that level of income.<p><a href=""http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/</a>",1429641027

When will it stop?<p>I don&#x27;t want it to stop - I think it&#x27;s a good thing.  By making a book impossible to pass from one person to another, the publisher is able to extract an income that is closer to the total benefit people derive from reading the book.  In short: authors make more money.  And so more books will be written, and readers will have a wider choice of better quality books.<p>And it&#x27;s not just that digital books kill the secondary market for books - they also allow publishers to be highly discriminatory.  If you are a woman in your 20s you pay full price for the new Taylor Swift biography, but a man in his 50s is offered a generous discount.  For the latest Glenn Beck polemic the pricing structure is reversed.<p>So not only do publishers get a larger slice of the book-value pie, they are also able to grow the size of the pie.

Giving the poor more money does nothing to change that.<p>In the real world operating under market rules, there&#x27;s not one rule that determines how much food we have. It&#x27;s a function of how much you invest in the operation -- land, tractors, farm labor, irrigation, livestock feed, food processing, et cetera. People know how much food to produce and how to produce it because of PRICES. Higher food prices are encourage people to reduce food waste (by making it more expensive, making concepts like &quot;leftovers&quot; or &quot;canning&quot; more attractive) or divert resources towards producing food (e.g. by starting new farms, buying better farming equipment, or starting a garden in their backyard). It also discourages inefficient forms of feeding people by raising the price (e.g. making meat more expensive because it takes a boatload of resources to feed a cow). Lower food prices reduce the profit of farming, discouraging the over-exploitation of the land or over-investment in expensive capital like tractors.<p>In a subsidized environment, the real cost of things is detached from the sticker price at the supermarket. Food is still expensive, but it&#x27;s not the consumer who&#x27;s paying for it -- it&#x27;s the taxpayer. So farms buy more heavy equipment than would naturally be efficient and burn more gasoline than is efficient, food processors waste more food than is efficient, people toss food in the trash more than is efficient, people grow rice in the California desert instead of importing it from somewhere that actually has rain, and midwestern farms destroy more prairie lands and Nature than is efficient, because why not? Taxpayers are paying for it, all crazy-indirectly, and they&#x27;d have to go through Congress and go up against big agribusiness lobbyists to get any of their money back. (Then the taxpayers find that they can&#x27;t pay for other nice things they might want, because of the money going to taxes, and the economy suffers.)<p>By giving people who need money, money, instead of giving producers a subsidy, you avoid all that. Everyone eats, farms produce the right amount of food with a sane amount of tractors, big factory farms aren&#x27;t given money that funky forest-culture farms aren&#x27;t and so each style of farm prevails on its own merits, people with backyards start gardens and make preserves, <i>et cetera</i>.<p>TLDR: screw with the market&#x27;s price mechanisms and you screw everything up<p>Postscript: This is all the fault of the FDR administration when you get down to it.",1429639793

That&#x27;s why we can divert portions of our food production to non-food products like plastic or fuel. The problem has always been and will always be making sure everyone has enough to eat, and the biggest problem there is not everyone has enough money to afford even the cheapest, nastiest food. Giving the poor more money might not be the only or even the best answer, but it is <i>an</i> answer.<p>No one in the US is starving because we can&#x27;t produce enough food. People starve because their access to the food is artificially hindered. In fact, we&#x27;re producing so much food the the US government pays farmers to <i>not</i> produce food so that prices will remain high enough to make a profit.",1429639575

9415827,comment,9415487,9415487,0,0,jasode,,,"Nice post.<p>When people wonder why floating point calculations sometimes don&#x27;t perfectly match the expectations of a &quot;correct&quot; answer[1], inevitably people will often respond with the famous paper, <i>&quot;What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic&quot;</i>[2].<p>Unfortunately, the people who suggest that paper don&#x27;t realize that it&#x27;s a very technical treatise and not an appropriate introduction for the types of programmers who ask the question.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought a better answer was to have the programmer &quot;construct&quot; a toy floating point format (e.g. 8 bits instead of 32-bit-or 64-bits).  The programmer would then notice that he has a finite representation of 256 possible &quot;states&quot; to represent -inf to 0 to +inf.  The programmer would have to <i>pick</i> a range and a precision to &quot;squeeze&quot; the Real Numbers into that representation of 8 bits.<p>Design choice 1:  I&#x27;ll have my 256 possible states represent -1billion to +1billion.  Well, since you can&#x27;t overlay 256 states/values across 2 billion <i>unique</i> values, you will have huge &quot;gaps&quot; between numbers.<p>Design choice 2:  I&#x27;ll have my 256 possible states represent -10 to +10.  With a smaller range, you can now increase the precision and represent fractional numbers with digits after the decimal point.  But the range is very small.  Also, you still have &quot;gaps&quot; where you can&#x27;t represent most[3] fractional numbers.<p>The programmer would quickly notice that he&#x27;d run into some contradictions.  No matter what he does, there will always be gaps.  The lightbulb would then go on and then he&#x27;d immediately scale up the limitations inherent in 8bit floating point all the way to 64bit floating point and know exactly why 0.3333 * 3.0 does not exactly equal 1.0.<p>It had been on my vague &quot;todo&quot; list to write such a tutorial but your blog post already gets that &quot;construction of floating point&quot; idea nicely.  The programmer can then explore more advanced topics of &quot;normalization&quot; and &quot;bias&quot; in designing a floating point format.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-math-broken"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/588004/is-floating-point-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.ht...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/474415/intuitive-explanation-for-how-could-there-be-more-irrational-numbers-than-rati"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/474415/intuitive-exp...</a>",1429639528

As in, a board meeting where everyone sits around the table rubbing their palms proposing to squeeze more money out of the poor bastards.<p>That is what I object to.  This brainwashing of the American public to create this image that busimesses are driven by not much more than greed.  Almost like it&#x27;s a bunch of pirates out to fleece everyone.<p>Why does it bother me? Because it drives an ideology that is actively damaging our country.  It drives political rethoric used to push nonsense like $15 per hour minimum wage and absolutely insane union rules and compensation packages.  It is a destructive ideology that does not promote cooperation between management and labor or government and businesses.  It assumes the guys at the top are all crooks, which starts of the conversation from an entirely distorted perpective.<p>I remember congressional hearing of the top three automakers where an ignorant-as-fuck congressman was pounding Ford to promise not to buy foreign-made fasteners &quot;to try to make more money&quot;.  This, completely ignoring the fact that we don&#x27;t make shit in this county any more and a lot of the shit we do make is grotesquely overpriced either because it is made for gov/mil applications or because our regulatory and labor framework (or both) simply make doing business far more costly.  And so, this highly refined moron of a congressman was focusing on a &quot;greed&quot; angle -because it plays well to his base to promote the idea that all businesses are greedy bastards- rather than understanding that cost optimization is pretty much forced upon you in the context of a global economy.<p>In terms of monopolies, we have laws for that.  Bad players ought to be dealt with accordingly.  Let&#x27;s not promote the idea that all businesses are greedy because of  the few that might misbehave.<p>Business is hard.  I&#x27;ve been at it for over 35 years.  I&#x27;ve had some monumental failures and notable successes.  Those who might point my way and call me greedy never sat with me in a dark garage or office 16 hours per day woking hard to make the thing go.<p>Yes, I am passionate about this because I hate the mentality being promoted in our country.  We are destroying ourselves fromthe inside out.  Instead of creating a society where rabid entrepreneurship is actively promoted and supported we are brainwashing people with an anti-business mentality that will eventually implode us.

People who can competently live in two different &quot;modes&quot; definitely have an advantage over those who are residents of just one.

But if this business model works and is legal then Netflix can say ""Hey look, your fancy new movie is going to get streamed over the internet anyway, you might as well license it to us"".<p>I imagine the studios make more money on average getting fifteen cents per watch from Netflix than selling a physical DVD to these other guys and letting them play it until it wears out.<p>So this business might encourage a shift that works out to everybody's advantage: the consumer, the studios, and the existing dominant player Netflix. Everybody's advantage, that is, except for this guy, who finds himself driven out of business as soon as Netflix starts streaming every title in their library.",1290700661

A teen exited from the heavy and large revolving door, and being a teen, he made sure the doors were spinning really fast when he left. When I was entering, I tried to stop it: I put my hand on one of the doors and tried to pull back.<p>Big mistake.<p>I realized the door was too heavy and still spinning rather rapidly. By the time I left my hand, the door was a centimeter away from finally entering the outside frame. I pulled away my hand just in time, but the shear weight of such a door coupled with the speed would have wiped out my fingers (there is no space between the door and the outside frame). I wouldn't know what would have happened.<p>In another instance, somebody closed a steal door (not common in North America) against my fingers. I went straight to the hospital as I couldn't move my fingers, but luckily everything was alright after a few hours. But a revolving door is a different story. It doesn't stop.",1290700590

end<p>Well, I have a few issues with it.<p>1) The voting system. 
I use twitter currently, because it adds greater value to the votes and also it spreads the idea for the site. However some people have reported that they don't want to post any twits and just want to vote. Do you think an anonymous voting system could be better?<p>2) The promotion of the site.
I'll be happy to get some advices about way to promote such an idea. I have tried with presenting the idea here in HN, however it was not enough.<p>Thank you for your time,

(I've been writing code for 20 years.)<p>One reason is to have result or loop variables, which help debugging.  You can ask debuggers to <i>watch the value change</i>, or print it, and so forth.  Almost always create variables; ignore premature-optimization ""experts"" who think they've sped stuff up because they used fewer variables.<p>Cleanup isn't repeated.  I despise ""hunting"" for return statements to ensure the same 3 things always happen.  Yes, maybe functions shouldn't do so much; but if you're stuck maintaining something you didn't write, you still have to be able to apply a change correctly.<p>Another problem with multiple returns is inconsistent types.  I've seen code where one person did ""return false"" and another did ""return 1.0"" in the same function; whereas, if you're forced to type ""isOK = 1.0"", you'll see the problem immediately.<p>And a single return point keeps overly-complex logic in your face, so that you have good incentive to fix it.  You're less likely to put off refactoring an ugly and oversized function if you keep having to scroll through it to figure out what a single case is doing.  Less code is ultimately good for maintainability.",1290698725

In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before. The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/</a>",1411567173

I regularly crawled IS24&#x27;s furnished apartment section and put new entries into a Google Fusion Table. That way I could filter on fields and see the apartments on a map at the same time.

Advil, Immodium, and Nyquil are pretty simple for people to report on: the thing that hurts stops == this drug worked (maybe).<p>Also, the one thing on the front page that made the largest impact on me is the brand name prevalence. If Iodine gets popular, that&#x27;s going to have a direct effect on brand name sales. Would you be interested in doing more upfront comparisons between generic and brand names?<p>People will still buy brand name if it makes them feel better/safer/whatever of course, but a 200mg tablet of ibuprofen should have the same effects no matter who makes it (allergies/reactions from dyes and coatings not-withstanding).

8361377,comment,8357089,8360859,3,0,vidarh,,,"> OCZ Vertex are the cheapest least reliable SSD&#x27;s in recent memory,<p>Vertex 3&#x27;s are perfectly fine. We&#x27;ve not had any of our Vertex 3&#x27;s fail, in fact, which means they&#x27;re one of our better performing models. Vertex 2&#x27;s are known to have high failure rates, and so is 4 (and we tried some 4&#x27;s and won&#x27;t again).<p>> I can&#x27;t imagine how you could ever justify those for database servers.<p>You answered your own question. Because they were cheap, and failure of individual drives does not matter.<p>For any given drive, we assume it <i>will</i> die. For any given RAID array, we assume the entire RAID array will die. For any given server, we assume the server will regularly crash or die. For any given data centre, we assume the data centre will eventually lose power or burn to the ground.<p>When you start out with those assumptions, that reflect real world risks any business should plan for, you then design your reliability around that:<p>Everything is in RAID&#x27;s and can afford to lose at least one and often two drives. Everything is replicated, so if the RAID or the server it is attached to dies, another server can take over. Everything is replicated to a secondary location, so if the data centres loses power (has happened to us - a suspected fire forced the data centre operator to shut everything down before the fire brigade could enter), we can make the decision how long to wait before we reroute (we don&#x27;t do that automatically at the moment, though we could - we&#x27;ve moved traffic transparently between the data centers in some instances).<p>To me, if you worry about data loss from failing drives, then your system is designed wrong.<p>If a system is designed for resilience,  drive reliability becomes purely economic question: How much it costs us to expend the effort on RMA&#x27;ing drives and send someone down to replace them vs. price difference for drives. In that calculation, the Vertex 3&#x27;s do just fine. We&#x27;re not buying more OCZ at the moment, but we&#x27;ll see what happens under new ownership, who knows.<p>> databases are important, for many people it&#x27;s the heart and soul of a business, recovering them can be very costly and especially time consuming.<p>If database recovery is costly, then in most cases someone is not doing their job. Few businesses have data that is big enough to justify not having both database level replication, regular snapshots, and nightly backups. For every database, we have about 4-5 copies newer than 24 hours old, at a minimum (master, slave, <1 hour old replica of the whole container the master runs in, <1 hour old replica of the whole slave container, and the newest backup image), as well as older snapshots. For some databases we have more copies than that. It costs us peanuts compared to what it costs us to serve up the live versions of the sites those databases are for.<p>> for average Joe, have a computer for 4-5 years and then throw the machine away, you can&#x27;t expect the same out of prod servers.<p>Yes, you can. For us, if we keep our production servers more than about 3 years, we lose money, since as long as we&#x27;re growing, we have the option of taking more rack space vs. rotating out our oldest servers and replacing them with servers that have many times higher capacity in the same space.<p>Our current oldest generation servers can handle about <20% of the capacity per 1U of rack space than our newest generation. With the cost of taking an extra rack what it is, it&#x27;s an absolute no-brainers for us to throw out those servers and replace them with new servers on about a 3 years cycle. Sometimes, if our growth is slower, we&#x27;ll leave it a bit longer, until we need the space, but 5 years is pretty much the upper limit.<p>For businesses with an entirely static, and small, workload, sure, you may prefer to keep the servers for longer, and those have the option of buying more expensive drives, or deal with more failures over the lifetime of their server.<p>> Please, please please in future when purchasing things for servers check the failure rate, if there is no real world data then DO NOT BUY those things.. especially avoid consumer markets, they&#x27;re cheap and cheerful for a reason.<p>Don&#x27;t assume we don&#x27;t check. And no, I most definitively will not avoid consumer markets. On the contrary. Enterprise components are sometimes worth it. But often they are priced and designed for people who are terrified of component failures or don&#x27;t want the &quot;hassle&quot;. When you have a system where component failure is an assumed &quot;everyday&quot; event, the consumer versions often have a far lower total cost of ownership.",1411566585

Think legalzoom and webmd...  Absolutely seems like it could be an entertaining way for a non lawyer or no doctor to explore a law or medical library.  The majority on my time spent with lawyers has been discussing my issue until it could be distiled down to a couple concise legal questions; I bought a short sell house and the seller demanded that I put a clause in the contract that said his bank couldn&#x27;t issue him an i9... I have. No authority over tax laws but I also didn&#x27;t want any liability or an invalid contract, nor to willingly build a bogus one. There was some real language subtlty to it all and I didn&#x27;t even know the questions to ask.<p>Same with doctors, pain is relative, strong pains turn lesser pains into mild discomfort and people are insanely good at ignoring and normalizing pains away.  Do most patients even know what to ask or describe?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;d love to have a lawyer and a doctor on my smartphone all day everyday but it still seems like a ways off.  Watson really seems like a tool that cuts your legal fees because your lawyers research time drops 90% or something. (Or rather, he makes 90% more profit from you..)",1411566549

The cable companies operate a few hundred, but they make no decisions about the programming of any one particular channel; they&#x27;re aggregators.<p>In order to argue that Netflix is a broadcaster you have to fit them into the &quot;channel model&quot; because that&#x27;s what makes &quot;broadcast&quot; broadcast.  On a particular channel only one thing is playing at any one particular time, and it&#x27;s the same everywhere.  So trying to shoehorn Netflix into that model you have to make some crazy assumptions about how their service works (that aren&#x27;t right) and then you get a channel count approaching or exceeding a million.<p>That&#x27;s patently absurd which nicely makes the point that Netflix isn&#x27;t a broadcaster.  Do you know how much bandwidth it takes to broadcast a TV channel?  It&#x27;s 8MHz.  8Mhz * 1mm channels = 8 Terahertz of total bandwidth if they&#x27;re broadcasting over the air, which according to all folks who are reasonable, is what a broadcast is.<p>If Netflix is a broadcaster than so is anyone who operates any website which doesn&#x27;t block Canadian visitors.

These questions are earnest head-scratchers for me.<p>To answer your first question, consumers care about manufacturing costs every time they agree to pay the producer of a good the producer&#x27;s asking price. But, this is not so much about caring about manufacturing costs as it is about respecting ownership rights.<p>In any case, it&#x27;s really splitting hairs to say that it&#x27;s copyright infringement vs. stealing. In fact, I believe that making that distinction is what is disingenuous. To the extent that a copyright has value, it&#x27;s because people respect that it represents ownership of a thing and, thus, the right to capture any value that the thing produces. When we don&#x27;t respect that, then we have effectively taken any value from the creator for his/her creation. Meanwhile, we enjoy value from the creation, whether we use it for ourselves, re-sell it, or otherwise. How is that not stealing?<p>I do get that people have always made a distinction between copyright infringement and stealing, but my question is why is that so? Actually, my original question extends further than that to ask, why is it that people additionally feel entitled to do so?",1411565305

You only need a single bit error of course for software failure.<p>Another interesting point to bring up is it is Very well known in the retro community that the details of eprom programming technique and certification (or lack thereof) of eprom programers has a dramatic effect on burn lifetime, like multiple orders of magnitude difference in burn lifetime.  Anyone can make an eprom burner that verifies an hour later.  Much harder to make an eprom burner that verifies 10 years later.<p>This affects more than stereotypical retrocomputing due to embedded devices.  Plenty of PBXes and machine tool controllers and scientific instruments and classic video arcade machines get scrapped because the eproms lost their minds.",1411564884

You&#x27;ll be better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general westerly direction. Don&#x27;t try to construct the future like a building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.

I think the hallmark of a really good entrepreneur is that you&#x27;re not really going to build one specific company. The goal—at least the way I think about entrepreneurship—is you realize one day that you can&#x27;t really work for anyone else. You have to start your own thing. It almost doesn&#x27;t matter what that thing is. We had six different business plan changes, and then the last one was PayPal.</i><p><i>If that one didn&#x27;t work out, if we still had the money and the people, obviously we would not have given up. We would have iterated on the business model and done something else. I don&#x27;t think there was ever any clarity as to who we were until we knew it was working. By then, we&#x27;d figured out our PR pitch and told everyone what we do and who we are. But between the founding and the actual PayPal, it was just this tug-of-war where it was like, &quot;We&#x27;re trying this, this week.&quot; Every week you go to investors and say, &quot;We&#x27;re doing this, exactly this. We&#x27;re really focused.

I say noob because you only experience this failure mode once before you&#x27;ll professionally refuse to deploy that way.<p>I have had historical issues with corporate procurement of dell servers with this problem.  There is a labor intensive strategy where you throw all the servers into one room and play switcheroo.  They&#x27;ll still be the same model and maybe even the same batch but at least they&#x27;ll probably not be adjacent serial numbers anymore.<p>A coworker of mine had the strategy of buying RAID servers and then pulling and replacing one drive from all the servers after initial burnin and keeping the yanked drive as as a cold onsite spare.<p>I would gladly pay a little more money to dell or a competitor to put together turnkey servers with carefully intentionally mismatched raid.",1411563847

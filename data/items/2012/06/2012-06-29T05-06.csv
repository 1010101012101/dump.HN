Cloud plans pretty much always cost more for the same amount of power. Cloud hosts take care of managing the actual server hardware for you, to the point where you can increase your capacity a thousandfold in seconds and you're shielded from most actual hardware failures. A cloud provider handles those headaches for you, and in return you pay more to be able to focus on the software side of your app.<p>Cloud plans can be cheaper, but AFAIK that's primarily when your capacity needs are bursty, because you can spin them up and down at will instead of maintaining a server farm that goes mostly unused half the time. (Or when your needs are very meager and the cloud is willing to sell you a tiny slice of capacity, because a cloud service's quantum of power it can sell is much smaller. On that end they compete more with traditional VPSes.)",1340948547

""Very rarely does a startup come along that I fall so madly in love with that it becomes a need-to-have staple in my life. Spotify did it for music, Mint did it for my personal finances, but Hachi has now done the same for the way I conduct business.""<p>If yes, then read on!<p>You've built relationships over the years - across schools, casual meetings, organizations, geographic locations - seemingly without much overlap. And these relationships are spread across your various social and professional networks - Gmail, LinkedIn, Facebook, Outlook, Salesforce, Smartphone, Twitter, IMs.. Now, imagine if this maze of contacts could actually be leveraged? If you could use your entire network of existing contacts to get to someone new? Anyone new that you want to reach out to - for business, social or personal work.<p>Hachi ( http://www.gohachi.com ) helps you do that.<p>Hachi uses the most powerful matrix in your life. Your professional and social circle! It searches through all your professional and social networks to give you the smartest way to reach anyone you want. 'Smartest' is the key word here, because not only does Hachi give you all the possible paths to reach your target, but it also recommends the smartest of those paths, based on intelligence about you and your networks. It goes further to actually get you communicating with that target.<p>The problem we are solving is interesting, real and challenging! We've been featured by MIT, Techcrunch, Business Insider, and many other mainstream US tech media. Our users love us! Enterprises are interested in using our solution. And, there's strong interest in our API.<p>The journey has just begun!<p>We are looking for 
- A problem-solver, who wants to solve interesting infrastructure, scalability and algorithmic challenges
- Someone who's comfortable with both, front-end and backend programming
- Experience with databases
- Open to quickly learning any new tools and technologies, as required
- Someone with a demonstrated history of intellectual and entrepreneurial exploration
- Has 2 to 6 years of experience (professionally or as a personal passion)
- Has the heart to go through the rollercoaster highs and lows of a startup journey.<p>What's in it for you?
- You get to build, evolve and shape a product that's being watched by the tech industry globally (MIT recently featured us)
- After proving your technical and problem-solving chops, you 'own' the product and have the opportunity to take up the role of Tech Lead. 
- Working amidst some of the really bright and passionate folks.<p>Perks
- Free food on Fridays
- Kitchen stocked with snacks
- Stock options
- Have fun making it all happen (check our Fb page for team pics)
- We've been thinking of starting weekend treks, but have just been lazy.. you can come and kick start it!<p>Location: Bangalore, India
Compensation will be a combo of cash+stocks.<p>If this sounds someone like ""you"" - then, this is a fabulous opportunity for you! It is a great time for you to team up with us, and be a part of our growth - our product is already validated, and there's encouraging user interest. You'll be saved from some of the very early struggles.. though more struggles and challenges of a different kind lie ahead.<p>Speed and clever execution are the key weapons of a startup. If you're interested, drop us a mail at info(at)gohachi(dot)com and tell us how you can help take Hachi to the next level. Please include a link to your GitHub / portfolio - applications without it will not be considered.

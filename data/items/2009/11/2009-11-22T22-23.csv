Unless they've put money down to test this, then their opinion should be discounted.<p>For those saying commissions are to high for a shorter term timeframe: trading has been commoditized. Lightspeed offers .40 per lot, and IBKR offers around that given a certain amount of trading volume. Forex brokers make money off the spread, and so the commission that you pay is only from the bid ask. Since you are trading small amounts, you will get hit on the comission structure, but if you pay per share rather than per trade it won't hurt as bad. You also might want to look into equity futures as well-- very liquid, good tax advantages, and good commission structures.<p>Biggest thing about small sizes is that you're subject to the pattern daytrader rule-- you can't make >3 intraday trades if your portfolio is <25k. SEC rules.<p>I'm a discretionary trader, and not a system trader. I am currently developing some systems to go live but they are not ready as of yet.<p>I also know of many who are quants, and it's possible and profitable.",1258930791

I have been curious for some time when/if a read-only API (with access to all information past/present) might be introduced to let people easily create alternate 'views.'<p>Everyone seems to start with building their own screenscraper + polling infrastructure (see two cool sites, for example, <a href=""http://hntrends.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hntrends.com</a> and <a href=""http://searchyc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/</a> ) which seems like a demotivating and fragile obstacle in the way of getting at the problem space where people actually want to experiment.<p>The SearchYC site (which is great don't get me wrong) has a JSON interface but only for search queries, not the more comprehensive and notification-based system that a definitive API could be.<p>My comment that there is no API could also be seen as a ""gripe"" I guess, but I am not really complaining about anything.

I assume there are overlaps between the two. I don't really care, I run both.<p>logcheck will watch your logs and email you when something shows up in a log that doesn't match a configurable set of regular expressions. When I add a new piece of software to a system, logcheck goes berserk. I go through the emails I receive and add in new regex's to ignore the harmless notifications until they finally taper out and disappear, only leaving me with the true exceptions.<p>Look over the documentation for all three of these, and make sure that they're actually running. Personally, I don't want an email unless something is wrong. If I get an email every day, I'll start to ignore it. I don't think I'd notice if an email I was ignoring didn't show up, so I optimize for no output unless it's something I should read. I chase down the cause of every exception in my logs. No excuses. If it isn't an exception, I add a regex to logcheck.<p>I run monit because it is pretty easy to set up, and it sends me an email when a server process gets changed or restarted. It lets me enforce limits on a server process, so I can potentially get warning of an attack as it happening. I suspect monit is nowhere near the most sophisticated tool for this purpose, but it meets my needs very well.<p>As for other basic security stuff... Don't use port 22 for ssh, use something much higher so that you won't get the continuous pounding on the front door that an ssh server on port 22 receives. Disable root login, as well as password login. Use certificates to log in to your machine. Configure servers to listen to 127.0.0.1 whenever you can. Install a software firewall to only allow access to http and ssh anyway.<p>Unless you've done something stupid with your web app, you've made it incredibly difficult to impossible for script kiddies. If you piss off an elite black-hat, it's probably safe to assume they can own you, and you likely won't know it. So make good backups, with regular offline backups that can't get destroyed by a hacker with a particularly malicious bent.",1258930597

Access your documents with our open API, mix and match.<p>The space is too crowded for you to try to welcome everyone. Focus strongly on business - if you can focus on more specific businesses that would even be better. Offer a compelling reason why they should use you. For my business, what I would like are:<p>- Desktop synchronisation
- ""Signing off"" on documents (cannot be changed)
- A way to store paper documents that somehow OCRs it (must not be perfect, just for search), and that allows me tag them with keywords
- A clear way I can map the online documents to the locations where they are physically (shelf3, room 15)
- Some type of category system that paid attention to the documents - for example, personal contracts of employees should not be mixed with working design drafts.<p>Pick a small niche that works with paper a lot and is not online too much (maybe Law?). Show them how your system improves their life. The start with that niche, perfect it for them and go capture the next.

I don't see it. I don't see reproducible, falsifiable experiments that can be made by disinterested parties to check climate change. That's what scares me.<p>Astronomy? I can, and have, checked it myself.<p>Physics? Friend of mine and girlfriend of mine are physicists; they've tested and re-checked many famous physics experiments for learning purposes as part of their studies.<p>Microeconomics? Can be tested. Has been tested. I trust it.<p>Macroeconomics? Skeptical of it, because of it's proneness to confirmation bias, politicization, inability to falsify it, and many historical errors that it's made in the past without even a serious mea culpa from the error-makers. Usually they just add a caveat, or say that whatever proved them wrong actually shows they're correct.<p>So climate change? I'm not convinced. Reproducible, falsifiable results. Show me - ""Here are the average temperatures and temperature variances in 30 regions in the globe this year. We predict the average temperature will rise by X% and variance will rise by Y% in at least 25 of these regions over the next five years. We absolutely don't expect the temperatures or variances to fall in any of these 12 regions most affected; that happening would cast serious doubt on our model.""<p>Something like that - they don't do it. But a bad hurricane season hits? Evidence of climate change. It's hotter than normal somewhere? Evidence of climate change. It's colder than normal? Evidence of climate change. No climate change? Well, hell, it's still evidence of climate change.<p>> Honest question: do you have a background in climate science or something similar?<p>Honest answer: A hell of a lot more than Al Gore, and 99.99% of people who strongly, passionately believe that ""We need to do something!""",1258930018

Pick a secure kernel, too, and make sure that your software is compiled with exploit mitigation techniques (e.g. ASLR, W^X).

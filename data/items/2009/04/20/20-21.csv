If you're building anything worthwhile, you will have competitors - if not in the beginning, after you launch. In order to be better than the competition, working smart is not enough, because you're not the only smart person around. The only option is to work smarter <i>and</i> harder than the competition. Now you could be in an industry where everyone works 8 hours a day, so working harder wouldn't give you too much incremental advantage. Unfortunately (or fortunately for those who can work 'hard'), tech startups are not that industry.",1240261024

The difference may be subtle, but it is there. Advertisements usually show a kid's life changed for the better, whether it is making more friends, or getting better grades. These are probably all accurate. But everyone has had these problems to some extent.

Sturgeon’s ""How Silicon Valley Came to Be"" where he notes:<p>The fact that the San Francisco Bay Area’s electronics industry began close to the turn of the Twentieth  Century should lay to rest the notion that industrialization and urbanization on the scale of Silicon Valley can be quickly induced in other areas. Silicon Valley is nearly 100 years old. It grew out of a historically and geographically specific context that cannot be  recreated. The lesson for planners and economic developers is to focus on long-term, not short-term developmental trajectories. Silicon Valley was the fastest growing region in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s; but that growth came out of a place, not a technology. Silicon Valley’s development is intimately entwined with the long history of industrialization and innovation in the larger San Francisco Bay Area.<p>See <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/00-014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/ipc/publications/pdf/00-014.pdf</a>",1240260263

More importantly, adding registers has not over the last decade been the primary mechanism by which processor speed is ""scaled"".<p>There are hardware people here that could articulate this more accurately and correctly than me; I've got some SPARC assembly game, but I'm not a hardware design guy.

It is a very useful experience because you get to do part of a sales job (selling, convincing people, handling disagreements, presentations) as an engineer.<p>However a lot depends on the size of the company. If the company is fairly large and established, you will hardly be able to influence product direction. In fact, you will most likely be in the position where you might be able to provide feedback to the product team, but you will almost never have the chance to do any hands on improvement to the product. Obviously that is because you are not part of product development/R&D, but believe me, that feeling sucks if you are a good engineer.<p>If you have never done it before and the opportunity presents itself, jump at it.

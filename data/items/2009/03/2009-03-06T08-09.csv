If there is an ever-present something which effects our universe, and there is change in our universe, then there must be change in that ever-present something's universe, right?

All this is so uncharted, nobody <i>really</i> knows what's ahead, but I can't help but want to be prepared. So I've been reading up on how to survive in a depression economy.<p>Everything I read says I need <i>REAL SKILLS</i>. Chopping, planting, shooting, fixing, cooking, building. Except I sit in front of a computer 12 hours a day-- and even my hobbies are kind of froo-froo (photography, film, working out).<p>All I keep thinking is that my very valuable skill set looks pretty pathetic in a prospective... ""new new"" economy.<p>During Depression 1.0 everyone seemed so nice. Men with little hats carried signs, ""spare a brother a dime?"" while everyone lined up nicely at the soup kitchen. That's a depression I could almost get on board with! But things have changed. Last night I watched a video of Korean militia defending grocery stores in the '92 riots. A couple months ago a fuel shortage rumor wiped out all the gas stations in Nashville and Atlanta for a couple weeks. My friend who works for Walmart replenishment has made it quite clear that the supply-chain is very efficient... and vulnerable.<p>I guess I'm kind of rambling because... I'm nervous. Does anyone have some MacGyver preparation tips so I can just start DOING something? Or maybe I just need reassurance?<p>How does a hacker contribute in a new new economy? Google just released their little money-saver database. Cool. If the future was green-tech and bio-tech, what does depression-tech look like?",1236328570

It's been a great boon to me.<p>All humans tend to believe that if they feel REALLY STRONGLY about something, they're right. The only way to disabuse yourself of this idea is to recognize, in your own words, how you felt REALLY STRONGLY in the past about a lot of stupid things, and to follow that to its logical conclusion.",1236328197

If you are only interested in the practical aspects of programming, I don't think that a university fits your needs.</i><p>I agree with this.  I've been working as a programmer for a couple of years now and I'm planning to go to university to study computer science.  I'm kind of annoyed that all of the universities I've looked at are all business now: the brochures are full of how students won't ""miss out"" on the practical, real-world side of things.<p>That's exactly what I'm <i>not</i> looking for, but unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any place to go if all you want is computer science.",1236328143

Everybody who isn't dumb knows where the model came from (and you don't want dumb applicants). So why not just be open about the fact and celebrate it? It would increase my respect for you, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. And if you've changed the model, why not say so explicitly and talk about why? It would at a minimum make for an interesting blog post.<p>This has puzzled me for a long time about the other YC clones, the ones who insist on pretending that they sprang up <i>sui generis</i> and take all these pains to act original. Who do they think they're fooling? How can they not see the incongruence of insulting founders' intelligence this way? All they're achieving by acting so prissy about it is drawing attention to how inferior a copy they really are, and what a culture gap there is between them and the founders they're addressing.",1236326704

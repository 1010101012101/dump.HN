It&#x27;s an ongoing movement to lock down devices against the user; to turn general-purpose computers into restricted environments for consumption and very little creation. No doubt the media companies&#x27; DRM interests are partially responsible for this.<p>Even the concept of a file as an application-neutral container for data is being slowly obfuscated away by this movement, as users are gradually conditioned to open apps first, and <i>then</i> open their data from them. I think one of my biggest surprises upon using an Android smartphone for the first time was discovering that it didn&#x27;t even have a rudimentary text editor by default (something that I was accustomed to on every other OS), nor could the standard file manager view text files although it could view movies, pictures, and music. As I understand it, the iOS situation is even more restricted than that, with not even a file manager provided as part of the OS.<p>As another datapoint, I&#x27;ve encountered quite a few <i>beginning computer science students</i> who didn&#x27;t really know what a file is, and were quite amazed that multiple applications could work with the same files.",1418079405

8719761,comment,8718596,8719632,0,0,milen,,,"> In that case, sandboxing could never be introduced. It is quite literally impossible to provide entitlements for any and all functionality under the sun, unless you include the entitlement &quot;allow anything&quot; in the mix.<p>That doesn&#x27;t follow. Sandboxing privileges present a wide spectrum ranging from providing no entitlements on one end to providing an &quot;allow anything&quot; entitlement on the other. Obviously, as developers, we want as much functionality exposed in a secure way but the unfortunate reality is that Apple either do not have the resources or willingness to do so.<p>> However, Mac apps are not required to be sandboxed. Only apps distributed on the MAS are.<p>While that&#x27;s technically true, an argument can be made that due to the inclusion of the MAS as part of OS X, it&#x27;s practically required for an app to be on the MAS as that&#x27;s where a lot of the users are and it&#x27;s how they get their software.<p>> Can you give examples?<p>Yes, Coda 2.5 [1] was not released on the MAS due to sandboxing issues. There are some radars on openradar [2] referring to other sandboxing issues, too - some of them are reasonable. Obviously, I do not have access to Radar itself otherwise I would have provided more examples.<p>> But that&#x27;s not even remotely a trivial task.<p>I don&#x27;t see that as a valid excuse for not providing an API while at the same time rejecting the usage of a temporary entitlement due to lack of said API. It&#x27;s a given that providing functionality in a sandbox compatible way would not be trivial - the work needs to be done if we want everything to be nice and secure. I&#x27;m perfectly aware that the effort required to implement such an API would be considerable and it might not be worth it but that doesn&#x27;t make it the right approach. And that&#x27;s why I accept the current situation - it&#x27;s a compromise between what could be and what Apple have decided to implement at present.<p>> Others would require massive work.<p>Yes and in an ideal world, if we&#x27;re fully committed to sandboxing, that work would be done. You said:<p>> Apple developed the OS that you&#x27;re using, so there&#x27;s hardly a trust issue when talking about running applications from Apple on top of the Apple-developed OS.<p>Sandboxing is not just about trust, it&#x27;s also about security. Apple&#x27;s own software not being sandboxed means its vulnerable to exploits, exactly what sandboxing is trying to prevent. If you check Activity Monitor, you will see plenty of Apple and others&#x27; apps being non-sandboxed - all of these are potential targets. A system is only as secure as it&#x27;s weakest link, so if we want a more secure system, we should working towards having more sandbox entitlements.<p>As a side note, the trust side of things is taken care of by code signing.<p>> And implied that this means Apple should allow third-party apps to continue violating rules because the existing experience of using that 3rd-party application somehow trumps everything else.<p>No, the implication is that Apple should be working towards exposing more functionality in a secure, sandbox compatible way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.openradar.me/search?query=sandbox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openradar.me/search?query=sandbox</a>",1418079076

We&#x27;re not running at such high margins that there&#x27;s a big opportunity for somebody to take what they learn from these blog posts and build a cheaper service to undercut us.<p>I&#x27;m still on the train on the way to work - my wife starts work earlier than I do, so I have to get the kids to school first.  I pinged the rest of the team over IRC, and they added:<p>&quot;we don&#x27;t have any trade secrets. email isn&#x27;t unknown, just complex. if you have a team of appropriately skilled people you can do it too, but if you have a team of appropriately skilled people you&#x27;re probably going to do something less painful&quot;<p>The thing is, it is actually pretty hard.  I got paged in the middle of the night a couple of days ago when our forwarding IP got listed on ips.backscatterers.org.  We watch a ton of blocklists to make sure our outbound IPs are clean, so legitimate email doesn&#x27;t get blocked.  In this case it was a forwarding account, and they said &quot;check your logs at this timestamp plus or minus a minute, it will be obvoious which email caused you to get listed&quot;.  Yeah, right.  There were thousands of emails within those couple of minutes - it&#x27;s OK if you send 5 emails per day.  The only option would be to lock the user who was the cause of the report through innocently reporting an email that was forwarded through a FastMail alias.  So we had to stop checking that blocklist.<p>We deal with stolen accounts _every_day_.  We deal with hacking attempts, DOS attacks, weird crap like Optus/Vodafone mobile networks in Australia being unable to access us for a few hours because of a fault in Singtel&#x27;s network for packets going _back_ from New York.  Nothing we, or even our datacentre could fix - but of course most of our customers don&#x27;t know, they just want their email, and it&#x27;s not working.  Most of the other sites those customers access are in Australia or at least US West Coast, so it looks like it&#x27;s just us that&#x27;s down.<p>So yeah, if somebody reads our blog posts and decides that running an email service is for them, good luck to them I say.

If you work in C++, you&#x27;ll grok concepts, traits, and the STL a lot better after working with typiclasses.  If you work in Go, you&#x27;ll grok interfaces and use them extensively.  If you work in Python, you&#x27;ll depend much more heavily on list comprehensions and inner functions than on mutating objects.  In most statically-typed languages, you start using Optional<T> instead of nulls, or at least a NullObject pattern.

In his autobiography, Tesla brings forth many exciting things about his creative process. He could prototype complete machines in his mind before building them. In his mind he could run tests, even see scars and blemishes on his machines. In my coding, I (feebly) try to emulate his method by trying to visualize my coding prototype in my mind. His short autobiography  reads like that of a mystic. In there he describes how the idea of AC current came to him, while taking a walk and looking into the Sun. Philosophically, everything in life alternates: the pairs of opposites, ebb and flow-- its seems to be the code of life; and AC current does the same, it alternates. His writings on Electricity are against the established grain: for him electricity (his only love) is the current of life. There cannot be two electricities(positive and negative,) he says, these are only terms for the state of having more or less of the same thing.<p>David Bohm has important things to say about the creative process. He talks about completeness (wholeness) of thought. He talks about &quot;mental models&quot; that we create to understand reality and how we keep growing out of older models... newtonian physics gives way to relativity etc.<p>Swami Vivekananda was a contemporary of Tesla and they did actually meet. He was a scholar of the Indian philosophy system called Advaita and Sankhya. As Jung has said about archetypes -- same thoughts occur to people of all ages, the Sankhya philosophy system believed in the equivalence of matter and energy. Vivekananda introduced  these ideas to Tesla and expected him to prove them. But the proof came ten years later with Einstein. I have written about this here:

NIH is <i>huge</i> in many sectors (fighting against this myself at work), and a lot of the same folks who are reluctant to let other people&#x27;s code into their work are also reluctant to give back to the community from which it came.<p>In certain places, using OSS is a colossal pain in the neck. Certain enterprise problems are completely unaddressed in various ecosystems, and when they <i>are addressed</i> (say, Ruby&#x27;s support of Kerberos and LDAP) they are usually just addressing the one or two pain points that that dev had at the time. People are usually not willing to <i>properly</i> solve a problem given limited time and resources.<p>Even if they <i>are</i> willing to exert effort, many ecosystems can be completely unhelpful and unwilling to give people with domain expertise the support they need to make meaningful contributions. As an example of this, working on a small math library for the new language Elixir, I had at least one person (in an otherwise amazing and friendly IRC channel) continually asking &quot;Wait, why are you doing any type of numerical stuff in Elixir?&quot;. Now, imagine that kind of reaction to enterprise features (<i>much</i> harder to get right!) in a different language, and you start to see why things are the way they are.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there are any ways of <i>fixing</i> this other than just doing it for the sheer joy of helping other programmers and knowing that, someday somewhere in some ledger, your effort will be rewarded--or at least marked as legacy some other sod has to work around. :)",1418078032
8719679,comment,8716539,8719277,0,0,jules,,,"Here&#x27;s a rough summary. Homotopy type theory is about proofs of equality. Proofs of equality can have computational content. For example, a proof that two types A,B are equal is given by an isomorphism f : A -> B, f^-1 : B -> A, such that f . f^-1 = id (in homotopy type theory that is further generalized to the concept of equivalence). A proof that two functions f,g : A -> B are equal is given by a function that takes an x:A and returns a proof that f x = g x for every such x. In particular in homotopy type theory it is not the case that if two things are proven equal, then they are identical. For example the type of integers is equal to the type of naturals (positive integers), because you can give an isomorphism, but it&#x27;s not identical because they are two different types. On the other hand the type of booleans is neither identical nor equal to the type of integers, because there isn&#x27;t an isomorphism. Homotopy type theory allows user defined types where you can have equality between two values that aren&#x27;t identical. These are called higher inductive types. An example of this is the type of finite sets represented as lists. The list [1,2,3] and [2,3,1] represent the same set, but they aren&#x27;t identical. They do however represent equal sets. One of the key points of homotopy type theory is that if you want to give a function f : A -> B where the type A has values that are equal but not identical, then you have to give a proof that whenever x1:A is equal to x2:A, then f x1 is equal to f x2. In other words, functions have to respect equalities. For example we can define a function on finite sets by given a function on finite lists, but in order to make that a function on finite sets we have to give a proof that the output of that function does not depend on the order of the input list. Similar ideas crop up all over the place. The most well known is perhaps the idea that a mathematical description of physics should not depend on the coordinate system you choose.",1418078012

I do not blindly accept that GaragePay&#x27;s use of `hdiutil` is harmless, like you are claiming. `hdiutil` is not sandboxed, and I have no idea what kind of security audit, if any, has been done on it to see if there&#x27;s any security vulnerabilities that would be exposed by allowing it to be run from a sandboxed application.<p>> The correct way to have resolved this was to expose APIs to access that functionality<p>Yes, APIs that allow for manipulation of disk images would be nice. But that&#x27;s not even remotely a trivial task.<p>> In almost all cases, the functionality can be sandboxed if Apple provided an API to access it securely<p>That&#x27;s practically tautological. &quot;The functionality can be sandboxed if Apple allowed it to be sandboxed&quot;. Some missing entitlements would be trivial to add. Others would require massive work. I suspect that exposing proper APIs to manipulate the Disk Images infrastructure would require a massive security audit, and probably significant work modifying the APIs as well as I expect they probably don&#x27;t meet the usability standard expected of public API.<p>> removing functionality objectively leads to an inferior experience due to the lack of said features<p>And implied that this means Apple should allow third-party apps to continue violating rules because the existing experience of using that 3rd-party application somehow trumps everything else.<p>Beyond that, I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that this does objectively lead to an inferior experience as well. Removing insecure functionality, or functionality that relies on non-public APIs, can lead to a superior experience, because the application is now more trustworthy, much less vulnerable to exploitation, and perhaps more stable or future-proof (in the case of non-public API). So it really can be quite subjective, and quite dependent upon the particular merits of the functionality in question.<p>> The root issue is that if the required entitlements were available, then the app wouldn&#x27;t be violating any rules at all and we wouldn&#x27;t even be having this conversation.<p>Again, tautological. &quot;If the app wasn&#x27;t violating any rules, it wouldn&#x27;t be violating any rules&quot;.",1418077389

Your suggestion to try to combat that situation by concentrating, essentially &quot;unionizing&quot;, developers, would fail for two reasons.<p>One, the developers are so numerous, diverse, and independent of one another that there would be an endless supply of developers willing to &quot;cross union picket lines&quot; and make more money with the competition reduced. In a sense, it&#x27;s like a mine with a hundred times as many miners as it needs, most of whom are struggling to get more than an hour a month of paid work and would do anything to get more. Also, the most important &quot;miners&quot;, Apple itself, Google and Facebook, have their own agendas and wouldn&#x27;t care about any &quot;developers&#x27; union&quot;, and if you combine the apps Apple, Google, and Facebook contribute to the iOS platform, the vast majority of the rest of the devs could disappear with almost no impact on Apple other than that Apple would stop announcing the number of apps in the app store during keynotes. They&#x27;ll eventually stop that anyway.<p>Two, Apple makes very little of its money from app sales. The indie devs aren&#x27;t the real miners. The miners are the actual employees of Apple and Foxconn. Apple sells hardware, and as long as they have their own apps, and apps from Google, Facebook, a couple of big game makers who are getting rich on iOS and aren&#x27;t going to walk away from it, plus apps from a small percentage of the indie devs, consumers will keep buying Apple hardware. Again, the vast majority of iOS devs could &quot;walk off the job&quot; and the &quot;mine&quot; would keep operating as if nothing had happened, other than a bit of editing to the semi-annual PR message.<p>An &quot;iOS developers&#x27; union&quot; would have so little leverage over Apple that Apple probably wouldn&#x27;t even &quot;fire&quot; developers who joined it (revoke their dev credentials).

Said another way, just lobbing an email to a list isn&#x27;t sufficient for transparency.<p>One of the biggest problems we&#x27;ve found with using email transparency for &quot;early discussions&quot; is that it&#x27;s often actively harmful (totally orthogonal to the content of the conversations).

I was shocked that the option to support the extension turned out to be a spying tool for advertisers to design ads that users wouldn&#x27;t want to block.<p>I tried installing ghostery just now and ghostrank is indeed opt-in now. It is a good thing they upped their PR and changed their faq less than 6 months ago to make it clear how they make money, but they have lost my trust long ago and there&#x27;s no coming back from that. Then again I wouldn&#x27;t trust a company whose business is advertising with protecting my privacy and I definitely don&#x27;t want better advertising, I want advertising to disappear from the web altogether as it was when i first started using it.",1418076073

The PC displaced mainframes and minis due to Moore&#x27;s Law and economies of scale. Those same forces are in effect in mobile, sure, but there are other barriers in effect that are completely unrelated to CPU power or cost that will prevent this displacement from occurring.&quot;<p>I was one of those in the past, now it is just obvious, just look at the number of mobile devices out there compared to PCs. The fact that you don&#x27;t like it does not make it less true.<p>Old people said the same about the command line, it was never going to be replaced for real work.<p>You assume that current restrictions will be maintained in the future. I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Apple was right and created a product useful for many common people. Programmers and power users believed that it was not necessary because they were fine and frankly because knowledge gave them power over them.<p>I am using Ubuntu on a tablet and I like it.

Applications installed this way should just work without the user going anywhere near rubygems.<p>So the real value added here is for developers not having to create/manage packages? Surely this is offset by the huge number of issues that working outside of a package manager causes. No shared libraries/dependencies, no universal way to update everything, no ability to manage installations with tools such as puppet/chef, no global mirror network, no assurances of package integrity, ect.",1418076015

Information transmission requires a sender and a receiver, an encoding for the information that is understood by both parties, and a medium. In this case, we have senders (people who write web pages) and receivers (African villagers). If we add in free Internet, we also have the medium. But without a shared encoding, all these are absolutely useless. The shared encoding is, in this case, the (written) language. But as long as rural Africans cannot speak English (or any other language commonly found on the web), and as long as they cannot at least read with some level of proficiency, we simply do not have a working system of encoding that could be used to transmit information.<p>Thus, in order for free Internet to be effective as a provider of information, we first need to give the target audience an education sufficient for reading and understanding English.",1445435915

For example, LSD has a stellar safety record. There are no recorded overdoses on it, and no known long term physical side effects. It is impossible to get addicted to LSD, because frequent use builds up a massive short term tolerance extremely quickly.<p>Contrast that with acetaminophen. It is widely and cheaply available, overused by a large number of people and it does some serious damage to your liver. You can also overdose on it.<p>Also, the pharmaceutical industry already produces many chemicals that are used recreationally, like opiates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines(including methamphetamine), various other stimulants, ketamine, DXM etc.<p>Infact, the only class of popular recreational compounds they don&#x27;t produce happen to be the comparatively much safer psychedelics including tryptamines, phenylethylamines and lysergamides.",1445435420

You won&#x27;t be imprisoned for the compulsive use of alcohol, regardless of the framework used to describe it (poor impulse control, chemical imbalance, whatever).<p>But if you go beat someone up or crash your car while drunk, you&#x27;re charged with those crimes, whether committed due to your addiction or not.  But outside of actual crimes committed against others in society, just being in possession of alcohol or being an addict isn&#x27;t illegal.  Additionally, there are resources for people who want to improve their dealings with alcohol or work out the issues that are causing their problems with it.  They can make use of these resources without fear of being arrested because mere possession and use isn&#x27;t a crime.<p>I don&#x27;t claim that habitual use of opiates or amphetamines or whatever is a positive thing but putting someone at risk of criminal penalties and prison because of something that is (at worst) very unhealthy is sort of preposterous when you think about it that way.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean we ought to turn a blind eye to crimes committed under the influence or in search of one&#x27;s dose but at a minimum, possession and use ought not to be criminal offenses.",1445434365

Rather extra sugar is converted to glycogen which can be easily accessed for energy. What happens when a runner carbo loads the night before a race? The pasta she eats is coveted to glycogen and stored in the liver not to fat.<p>However, when the liver storage of energy is full, it then converts the excess to fat. Think about this for a second. The glycemic index and load don&#x27;t apply because most people convert excess blood sugar to a readily available energy stored in the liver as glycogen not fat.<p>The problem is that Americans culturally never deplete the storage of energy in the liver because of two reasons; first, Americans snack all the time and drink sugary drinks, and, second, which I don&#x27;t understand, we have developed an idea that we should eat huge third meals at night.<p>A big dinner will completely replenish the energy stores in the liver leaving excess sugar that will be converted into fat during sleep. Perhaps, it is smarter to eat a decent breakfast that contains simple sugars which are absorbed faster into the blood stream, a big lunch which will provide energy for the rest of the day, and a small dinner to satiate hunger.<p>For a person who wakes up around 7am the fast should begin around 5pm in order to let the sugars deplete around bed time. There is no reason to have readily available sugars while sleeping. And then in the morning break the fast.<p>There is no reason to have big dinners which are ridiculous.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen</a>",1445433465

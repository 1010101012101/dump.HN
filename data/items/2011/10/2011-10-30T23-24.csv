Hand drawing takes a lot of practice and determination to get past the initial 'this looks like sh<i></i>' stages..<p>I agree with you as far as the experience and the analysing of shapes goes... and yes... the next step after reading the tutorials should be to go and play with the shapes and create something new, experiment and find your own way of doing things. From some of the feedbacks I received that is happening for quite a few users that go through the steps and then turn the simple circles into an owl, a tiger or a dragon. Something they would not have created from scratch with pen and paper as they lacked the self esteem and believe in their art creation skill.<p>I tried to go a different way in the tutorials to give the readers a simple approach towards 'constructing' elements from basic building blocks - rather than struggle with perspective and proportion.",1320019189

If I had only an hour to teach a young child some fundamental CS concepts, I would make sure to include the concept of recursion. Common Lisp makes this, as well as a few other CS 'building blocks', trivially easy.<p>(The reason I'm distinguishing between programming and CS here is that 'programming' is a broad term that encompasses a number of use cases.

3175703,comment,3174727,3175297,5,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Sure.<p>The paper mentions HList, the ""heterogeneous list"" package, which often gets used for extensible records and static duck typing; HList uses type-level numbers and lists, and extensive type-level computation.  I've wanted to use HList in the past, but the sheer pain of the types involved made it not worth the trouble.  It also includes several (incompatible) variations of internal implementations with different tradeoffs.<p>Several packages exist for ""session typing"", which allows specification of a communication protocol between functions by using complementary types.  Those involve heavy type-level computation on families of related types; this extension would help greatly.<p>I've personally encountered multiple cases where I'd like to operate on an arbitrary function or type regardless of its arity (how many arguments it takes), but doing so typically requires writing a family of handlers for various argument lengths.  This extension would allow handling all of the cases generically.",1320017134

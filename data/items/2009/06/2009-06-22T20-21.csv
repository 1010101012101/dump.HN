(<a href=""http://www.probability.ca/jeff/writing/montyfall.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.probability.ca/jeff/writing/montyfall.pdf</a>):<p><Quote><p>Nebulous Neighbours:<p>Your new neighbours have two children of unknown gender.
From older to younger, they are equally likely to be girl-girl, girl-boy, boy-girl, or boy-
boy. One day you catch a glimpse of a child through their window, and you see that
it is a girl. What is the probability that their other child is also a girl?<p>Solution.<p>The probabilities that a glimpsed child will be a girl for each of the four possi-
bilities (girl-girl, girl-boy, boy-girl, and boy-boy) are respectively 1, 1/2, 1/2, and 0. Since
the probabilities must add to 1, the probabilities of these four possibilities are respectively
1/2, 1/4, 1/4, and 0. Hence, the probability is 1/2 that the other child is also a girl.<p></Quote><p>Can someone explain how glimpsing to one child and seeing that is a girl is different from hearing the parent saying that one child is a girl? How come and getting the same information from your eyes instead of your ears changes the probabilities? (1/2 for the other child to be a boy when seeing, 2/3 when hearing).",1245702769

Someone asked if the badly written code was really causing any problems, and then everyone thereafter seems to just take as an assumption that badly written code does not create any real problems.  Well, badly written code often does cause performance problems and disguise bugs.  I have inherited code bases where things were taking ridiculously long because the code was a convoluted and almost incomprehensible mess.  Making it simpler and more comprehensible was a necessary prerequisite to make it operate at a reasonable speed.<p>2. There seems to be an assumption that you can write code rapidly or comprehensible code, but not both.  In my experience, programmers who write incomprehensible code are not more productive than the programmers who write comprehensible code, often the opposite.  There is no polite way to say this, but incomprehensible code is more often the result of less knowledge or intelligence than it is the result of a desire to get a lot done.  Furthermore, stopping to think before coding can often lead to much shorter development times than just diving in and typing the first thing that pops into your head.<p>When I have been in the role of technical person with non-technical management, my implicit approach is ""evaluate me on what I produce and how quickly I produce it, but stay out of the code.""  If I am being hired because of my knowledge of how to make computers do what you want, evaluate me on that, and let me figure out the best route to get there.",1245701698

Another way it helps is that it makes sites ""stickier""; without RSS, people would not have something automatically telling them ""Hey, that site you liked updated!  Go check it out!"".

(Not that I particularly care—while it is nice to have readers, I write mainly for my own amusement, and my site is not commercialized at all.)<p>And I think that these two factors are a net win for most sites, whether commercial or not.  There are ways around the advertising issue—offer truncated feeds, put ads in your feeds, provoke comments, etc.  Plus, I thought that the known wisdom was that regular readers don't use ads much, it's the ones that stumble onto your site from Google, etc.?  I haven't seen a study, though.<p>Also, for the record, I basically don't check sites that don't offer RSS.  If it's particularly good, it'll get bookmarked, and maybe I'll come back to it in a few months when I've got some free time.  But most sites don't even get bookmarked.  On the other hand, if I find a site that had a good article, I'll often add it to my RSS reader on a trial basis.",1245701288

Give me a break.""<p>You have to be a little careful with statements like that, user experiences are highly subjective, and different people find different processes more appealing.<p>I personally have no desire to deal with Apple's support for my MBP, or going to a packed apple store in my spare time (if this is part of the friendliness thing you were referring to, if not, my misunderstanding), but I can easily get my Dell serviced on site while I'm at work at no cost to me, and within 2 days of placing a service ticket.<p>If it's less about business friendliness and more about UI design and user experience, that's also highly subjective, I've met people who think at least one platform ""just feels right"" to them.<p>Bottom line, with all the choices we have available today, why is it even debated with such rigor anymore?

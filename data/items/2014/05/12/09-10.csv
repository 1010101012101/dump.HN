After 30 minutes of reaction all water would boil away.<p>It is interesting for the study of nuclear waste disposal - this is 2 billion years old nuclear waste still sitting exactly in the place where it was created",1399888786

It does add one more control point per curve (so it&#x27;s bad for the overall size of the drawing) but it&#x27;s not an approximation, it&#x27;s the exact same curve.

7731872,comment,7729260,7730145,3,0,exDM69,,,"I saw a few videos about blind kids who echolocate [0], and got inspired by it. The videos only briefly showed how they practice, but it did show a teacher training a pupil by putting a pane of glass on either side of the head and then made him guess which side it is on.<p>Echolocation is not some kind of magic ability, where a person without vision gains superhuman abilities to measure time between echoes. This is the way it is often portrayed in the media, though.<p>Shaping your mouth and your lips, click with your tongue to create a <i>directional</i> click going to your left or right hand side. Then listen to the sound of the click (the click itself, not some magical echo 10 ms later) and try to hear differences in the color or timbre of the click. It&#x27;s just <i>like tweaking the settings of a reverb effect in an audio software</i>. Hard surfaces like glass or concrete sound very different from soft things like humans or trees. Distant objects sound different than close ones.<p>Scientifically, you are measuring the <i>impulse response in frequency domain</i> [1] (ie. spectrogram). According to the <i>convolution theorem</i> [2], the impulse response has all the &quot;information&quot; about the surroundings you can have (applies to acoustic, mechanical and electrical signals too).<p>I sometimes practice by trying to navigate long hallways at the office and trying find my desk without the help of eyesight (I know it is n&#x27;th door to the left, and open doors are easy to tell from hard walls). Sometimes I practice outdoors just trying to recognize trees, buildings, cars or humans from their echo.<p>Blind people often echolocate subconsciously by listening the echoes of their footsteps and surrounding noises. This was demonstrated by a echolocation teacher by playing white noise in a familiar room and seeing their new students who claim they don&#x27;t echolocate get lost in their own living rooms.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9mvRRwu5Gw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9mvRRwu5Gw</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem</a>",1399888411

From what I hear, Valve intends to make some SteamBox/GnuLinux competition.  If OpenGL sucks compared to D3D and Mantle (more difficult to develop in, or just less efficient at runtime), this competition may not take off.  Also if porting existing D3D (or PS3/4) games to OpenGL is hard, it likely won&#x27;t happen.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m only talking about smokin&#x27; fast and shiny AAA gaming, where D3D currently dominates.

7731846,comment,7730808,7731471,1,0,joyofdata,,,"“It is remarkable that mind enters into our awareness of nature on two separate levels. At the highest level, the level of human consciousness, our minds are somehow directly aware of the complicated flow of electrical and chemical patterns in our brains. At the lowest level, the level of single atoms and electrons, the mind of an observer is again involved in the description of events. Between lies the level of molecular biology, where mechanical models are adequate and mind appears to be irrelevant. But I, as a physicist, cannot help suspecting that there is a logical connection between the two ways in which mind appears in my universe. I cannot help thinking that our awareness of our own brains has something to do with the process which we call &quot;observation&quot; in atomic physics. That is to say, I think our consciousness is not just a passive epiphenomenon carried along by the chemical events in our brains, but is an active agent forcing the molecular complexes to make choices between one quantum state and another. In other words, mind is already inherent in every electron, and the processes of human consciousness differ only in degree but not in kind from the processes of choice between quantum states which we call &quot;chance&quot; when they are made by electrons.”<p>Freeman Dyson",1399887978

7731839,comment,7730415,7730415,6,0,jamesu,,,"After spending a few months porting a Direct3D9 game to work in OpenGL 2.x, this article certainly resonates with me. It&#x27;s quite easy to get code working nice and fast in one driver, while in another it stalls and drops down to 1 fps because you didn&#x27;t anticipate the driver developer designed their version of the API to work under different performance characteristics.<p>Meanwhile in Direct3D9, the game still runs smooth at 60+ fps on all major drivers on most recent hardware. Granted, it&#x27;s a bit of an Apples vs Oranges comparison, but it certainly causes a lot of headaches especially when you need to go so far as to modify the art so it batches better.<p>There is also still a lot of conflicting information on how best to use OpenGL.

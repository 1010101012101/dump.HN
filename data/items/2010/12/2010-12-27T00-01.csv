Otherwise, serious communication would become next to impossible, let alone serious discussions.<p><i>> For example, my dictionary states:</i><p>Dictionaries don't provide exact definitions. However, your quoted description seems to be the best you can get out of three lines. If you care to read 4-6 lines, you'll get the quite accurate FSF definition. If you care to read even 10+ lines, you'll get the detailed OSI definition.<p><i>> Indeed, this definition is more in line with what many people think when they hear ""open source"".</i><p>That's an important issue. Neither the term Free Software nor the term Open Source are completely self-explanatory. So people will inevitably have misconceptions about those if they've neither read a proper definition, nor had someone explaining it well enough to them.<p>The concrete issue with the term ""Free Software"" is that people might think: Oh, this software is free (no cost), so it must be Free Software. Eric S. Raymond and others tried to solve that problem by inventing a new synonym, ""Open Source"".<p>However, the term ""Open Source"" has issues as well, because people might think: Oh, the source code lies open in front of me, so it must be Open Source.<p>Note that this is a general problem. Hardly any technical term is totally self-evident to ordinary people. Just because a technical term is not self-explanatory doesn't mean you can simply ignore its exact definition.",1293410560

2041474,comment,2036799,2036799,0,0,vsync,,,"I use XEmacs.<p>Many (~10) years ago I went back and forth between both and found that I really preferred XEmacs more.  A lot of it went to the thought that JWZ and others put into being a proper X11 application; and the fact that it wasn't X11-only: you could have full colors in a terminal (and dark/light color theming) and they listed a packaged Win32 build on their site.<p>Other thoughts - XEmacs at the time seemed better prepped for picking up and running with out of the box.  I think the situation's probably a little reversed now; I see some nice stuff in GNU Emacs out of the box and some extensions are either GNU-only or with XEmacs as an afterthought.  That said, everything I use works fine in XEmacs, and I can always hack anything I need.<p>That brings me to my next favorite: extending the editor.  GNU Emacs has inherited (apparently from RMS) a dislike for abstract data structures.  Everything's a list of chars, which are just integers.  You can implement other things on top, but your tools are limited and at the interface with Emacs itself it's about as low-level and manual as Unix syscalls it seems.  Fontifying is also handled more cleverly in XEmacs.  Some of this may have changed since I last looked into it in detail.<p>Finally, as a Common Lisp developer, XEmacs Lisp leans more in that direction than GNU Emacs Lisp, which seems like a crufty amalgam of MacLisp and Scheme, plus the aforemention disdain for data structures.  I'd probably be happier with an entire Common Lisp editor but XEmacs does so much.<p>An anecdote: recently a friend had to use Emacs for school to work with Mozart (<a href=""http://www.mozart-oz.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozart-oz.org/</a>).  I actually suggested he use GNU Emacs because while I favor XEmacs I know GNU Emacs is a little more actively developed and widely used.  He had a few things he wanted help customizing and I was shocked how arcane some of them were to customize in GNU Emacs (read, Lisp coding, and not clean Lisp coding either), while in XEmacs they were simple checkboxes in the ""Options"" menu.  I forget the specific examples but I can post if I remember.<p>I do wish XEmacs were more actively developed -- maybe that's a hint for me to jump in and start helping out -- and I especially wish the 21.5 series would hurry up and get made into a stable release version so the good new features in there would be widely available.  However I still find XEmacs to be a great editor and more useful for _my_ needs than GNU Emacs.",1293410132

I'm sure I don't need to list any of the major corporate fraud cases that have plagued the news recently (from the major financial meltdown to Enron, etc), not to mention corporate fraud that's occurred in earlier days of even less regulation and oversight.<p>Clearly, if data protection legislation is actually going to work there needs to be some way of verifying that companies are really following the law.  That may mean there has to be some independent agency that actually investigates what corporations do with the data they collect.<p>In the US, in the present political climate, such an agency is bound to be seen as overly intrusive in to private sector businesses, so there's bound to be much opposition to it (if the idea ever even sees the light of day).  Even the prospects of serious data protection legislation in the US is only dimly glimpsed on the horizon at the moment.<p>But even strong data protection legislation with strong oversight would not really address the core issue, which is that the corporations have data on you in the first place.<p>In my opinion, the only way to address this issue is with a robust system of anonymity that connects consumers to providers and vendors.  Fully anonymous money transfers, fully anonymous internet connections, and some way of keeping the provider and vendors from subverting these mechanisms via cookies, OS/browser fingerprinting, etc, would need to be part of this solution.<p>Unfortunately, the political, legal, social, and technical challenges involved in such a scheme put it far in to the realm of science fiction for the foreseeable future.",1293409265

I haven't fact checked them or anything but AFAIK they are completely accurate. I was however challenging the importance of them.<p>Policy decisions should absolutely be based in fact and reality. Yet they rarely are and the unintended consequences of almost every single law in every single country in the world proves it. This is why it's best to avoid policy decisions in the first place or at least minimize them and their impact.<p>Thirdly, yes it's terrible that people believe wrong things. But here is a surprise. They always have and they always will. Who knows maybe you and I both believe wrong things. As long as these wrong facts can't harm other people it doesn't do a lot of harm.<p>Should we try to teach them about the truth. Of course we should try. Should we punish them if they don't accept our version of the truth? No.<p>I for example am frustrated when intelligent people still insist on seeing the world as zero sum. It is a cultural issue more than anything. As that is what we have been brought up with from countless hollywood movies with evil rich guys taking land away from the common folks and what have you. I try whenever I can to teach about this, but I know it is an uphill battle.<p>Facts are important. But understanding the effects and importance of facts is even more important and is unfortunately not an objective task.<p>If you're interested Russ Roberts of EconTalk had a very interesting discussion of bias within Economics, where he attempted to look critically at his own and other economists biases in analyzing empirical evidence, which is essentially what our discussion is about:<p><a href=""http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/01/roberts_and_han.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2009/01/roberts_and_han.htm...</a>",1293408575

I do not want to use ORM and I actually prefer other templating system like Mako. I have coded on django extensively in the past. Recently I read up on pylons - and I like it a lot. However, I find their lack of plugins to be a huge turn-off. As far as I know, the developers for pylons are moving to pyramids. Flask from pocco looks nice but it's still immature as of right now.<p>On the other hand, I did a quick search on github and saw RoR is immensely popular. I personally know ruby and hate the language quite strongly. However, there are also a lot of plugins for RoR, and with other services tailored to RoR (like Heroku), it seems that RoR is the de facto standard for web dev.<p>I am a technical founder and I want to use a framework which would be as easy as possible to deploy and scale. Of course, the ability to find recruits on my campus for my team is also a huge factor why I want to pick a popular framework.<p>Frankly, I want to stay in Python but given the traction of RoR I am debating whether I should give it a try.<p>Please advise",1293408536

Both Falcon 9 launches have been a success.<p>India uses the same engines that the Russians have used for their Progress supply ships and Soyuz Rockets.  Tried and true, numerous launches and successes behind them - a design that has been mostly unchanged in the last 30 years.<p>There are two parts to Elon Musk's thesis.  1) vertical process is more reliable - so far, 66% launch success rate.  2) Space cargo would be one tenth the price of existing solutions.  One needs only review the Iridium contract to realize that $452 million is not one tenth of Arienespace's bid - it is about 105%.  So, that cost savings is not being passed through to the US taxpayer, or, his estimate of 10% of the cost of conventional heavy lift systems was a bit overzealous.  In addition, their bid for the ISS resupply contract exceeds the Progress supply flight costs.<p>In order for any solution to be 10% the cost of an existing solution, you have to get a rocket to escape velocity with less fuel, a more efficient engine using 10% of the fuel or, fuel that is 10% the cost of existing fuel, or some combination thereof.  I don't believe rocket technology can become efficient enough to meet those claims.<p>Even the Delta IV which is the Dragon's direct competitor, had 18 launches, with one partial failure where the satellite didn't make orbit.  One might contend that the Falcon project would need 36 more successful launches  before he could say his process is more reliable than the Delta IV platform.

8963685,comment,8960303,8963511,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> In particular, the FCC has built up a large amount of precedent restricting its own ability to forebear from applying regulations:<p>The article you posted neither claims nor supports that (the article&#x27;s analysis is also a mess for other reasons, but addressing those would only be germane if you were citing it for the claims it makes.) The only thing that article actually says that relates to FCC &quot;precedent&quot; is repeating a bunch of things about how the FCC has handled <i>forbearance petitions</i> -- and nothing in that about the scope of forbearance powers, just procedural things about the petition process. Since forbearance concurrent with Title II classification isn&#x27;t handling a forbearance petition, that procedural discussion is all completely irrelevant.<p>The only thing it says about restrictions on the FCC <i>ability</i> to forbear is referencing the statutory limitation on forbearance on Section 251(c) regarding certain obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers.<p>(The closest the article comes to your argument that the FCC has &quot;built up a large amount of precedent restricting its own ability to forebear&quot; is the simple and unsupported description that the FCC using forebearance in association with net neutrality would be using &quot;unprecedented and undocumented authority to forbear willy-nilly&quot;, which -- even if it was accurate -- fails to support your point, because the absence of precedent isn&#x27;t the presence of contrary precedent; its inaccurate because the authority to forbear from any regulation or provision of Title II, with a few specific restrictions, is quite well documented at 47 USC Sec. 160(a).)<p>> Reclassification will be a huge opportunity for consumer protection types to push for rate setting, and the FCC will have to defend why forebearance is appropriate.<p>Not for rate-setting, because Title II doesn&#x27;t require rate setting even before considering any application of forbearance. Title II only requires rate <i>publication</i>.<p>It <i>allows</i> rate setting (specifically, it permits, either upon petition or on the Commission&#x27;s own initiative, the Commission to engage in hearings on any rate notice change), but does not require it (even before considering any application of forbearance), so no forbearance is necessary for the Committee to decline to engage in rate setting, even for a service determined to be within the scope of Title II.",1422493023
8963684,comment,8962185,8963395,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I was actually being mostly serious. I understand that the &#x27;theory&#x27; of CS isn&#x27;t inherently tied to computers, but in practice getting the computer stuff to work is where the vast majority of the time gets spent. Especially when CS100 is in Matlab, CS200 is in java, CS300 is in scheme, etc. That&#x27;s a large part of why I ended up not studying CS in college, because I didn&#x27;t have 40 hours a week to spend on a 1 credit compiler class and not fail all my other coursework.<p>It&#x27;s weird because I currently work as a developer and I&#x27;m definitely deeply reliant on other people who did study CS. But at the same time it seems like a lot of them have sacrificed way more than they&#x27;re actually getting back. The only thing more cliche than non-technical folks who &#x27;just need a tech person&#x27; is deeply technical folks wasting years of their lives building things that it would be obvious no one wanted if only they had a liberal arts background.",1422493013

More attention on perfect C code means less attention (reader attention and author attention alike) on the essential facts the author is trying to communicate.<p>In addition, I&#x27;m not an expert at this stuff, but it seems like initializing that variable would make the disassembly more complex and thus obfuscate the point just that much further.",1422492784

If there is an abstraction, then how much of the native platform do they cover?  It can&#x27;t be 100%, and the native APIs change with every OS version.  Basic calls are easy, integrating things like device keychain, intents, and services are not so easy -- we learned this with Titanium.<p>2) How will React Native do cross-platform local data storage?<p>Being able to easily import, retain, and sync remote data is an absolute need for today&#x27;s apps.  Titanium uses SQLite on both sides, and has modules for more (like TiTouchDB).  Not abstracting data storage would be a major mistake IMHO.<p>3) Can we use standard npm modules?<p>JS&#x27;s killer feature is the module ecosystem, it&#x27;s no good having a JS engine if we have to reinvent common modules to match a new API.  V8 is the gold standard here, fingers crossed.<p>4) Debugging?<p>Speaks for itself.  Debugging both JS and native code together bridged from a device is <i>hard</i>.

Facebook seem pretty serious about doing all new developement in React.<p>3) the specific kind of developement they&#x27;re doing is similar to the one I have to do right now, viz. taking an established mostly static page and adding bits of highly interactive and dynamic behavior here and there. Google used Angular to reimplement the app from scratch. I can&#x27;t afford that.<p>4) Angular, at what will probably the top of its popularity right now, just broke all interfaces and syntax and everything during the passage to 2.0, for reasons that were never fully explained (to me at least). Facebook won&#x27;t be able to do that without breaking the proportionally large investment they had so far with React.js and incurring significant costs, which is nice and stable and comfortable. If the benefit/cost ratio of React 2.0 (or 1.0, I guess) is acceptable for Facebook, then it will probably be acceptable for me, too.<p>5) React interacts nicely with their Flow typechecker, which I think is, uh, the safest vector, right now, to foster the adoption of algebraic typing in the mainstream of programming.

When you put it into the hands of a person, then it takes on a kind of life.<p>Think about bricks. Let&#x27;s say you have a brick. You can throw it through a window, perhaps to scare / hurt / burglarize someone. You can also build a shelter for domestic violence victims. The brick couldn&#x27;t care less - it&#x27;s just a brick.

If you&#x27;re humble, caring, and generous, and you get a bunch of money, you&#x27;re going to be what people call a philanthropist, and the world will be better for it. The world also has plenty of these people.

Computers, guns, hammers, and cars can be used for good or bad purposes [2]; it&#x27;s the person wielding them which makes the difference.<p>As to what you do with money? Well of course, you have to take care of your own basic needs. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that. Afterward? If you want to make the world a better place, then money makes you more empowered to do so. It might mean paying someone&#x27;s utility bill or letting them stay with you while they get back on their feet. It might mean investing in the local homeless shelter, or volunteering your time at a soup kitchen. It&#x27;s up to you. With creativity, there&#x27;s no end to the ways you can help the world ... but you can only do so if you have the ability to help, and having money can absolutely be part of that.<p>There are definitely some toxic notions in our culture about money ... that someone with it must be &quot;bad&quot; whereas someone without it must be &quot;good&quot; ... but it&#x27;s just not true. It&#x27;s catchy, and with a little envy it&#x27;s easy to believe it and then rationalize taking rich people&#x27;s money &quot;just because&quot; (even moreso if you&#x27;re led to believe some of that is going to come your direction).<p>Still doesn&#x27;t make it true.

Besides, nobody is saying &quot;the police did nothing, therefore I uploaded it to YouTube&quot;.<p>The best reason I can think of for sharing an animal cruelty video with the public (or at least doing so before exhausting any <i>effective</i> strategy) is when you need help identifying the culprit, so you can properly report it. But YouTube isn&#x27;t the right community for that sort of thing.<p>> <i>And what of states where creating that video in the first place is itself a crime?</i><p>How does that excuse uploading the video to YouTube? If making the video itself is a crime, then sharing it with the public seems like a great way to get yourself in trouble.<p>If your intention was to try and distribute the video anonymously, surely there&#x27;s ways to anonymously submit complaints + evidence to the police.<p>> <i>What if the abuse is not criminal, but you wish to convince the public that it should be?</i><p>Good question, perhaps that situation does warrant uploading to YouTube and spreading publicly. Although you&#x27;d need to be careful of exposing yourself to a defamation lawsuit there depending on whether the perpetrator in the video is identifiable. Although even in this case I&#x27;m skeptical as to the efficacy of this action.<p>Related to this, I&#x27;d say that the best justification for uploading such a video would be if the video is considered to be in the public interest. This would cover situations such as a government-funded institution engaging in unethical/criminal behavior (I&#x27;m thinking here of things like Abu Ghraib).

This looks nothing like the 70s.<p>The &quot;socialists&quot; were right in the 30s, then they were wrong in the 70s. Now they&#x27;re right again. In 30 years they&#x27;ll probably be wrong again.

The WC specs have a number of design flaws, in my opinion, and they don&#x27;t work as efficiently as possible with databinding solutions, etc. I can expound more on this in a blog post. But our binding system works fine with Web Components. So, you can import a Web Component and use it inside a view with databinding and even attach additional behaviors to it without any problems.<p>Web Components are not yet a standard. They are primarily being pushed by Google without taking much feedback from other vendors. I spent almost a year working with building frameworks around them...and decided there was no real advantage to using document.registerElement for an Application Framework.<p>Again, if you want to build Web Components or use Polymer...that is fine. You can use that with Aurelia. But Aurelia&#x27;s custom elements aren&#x27;t built that way.<p>As a side note, Aurelia will be able to &quot;export&quot; its custom elements to Web Components. So, before we hit v1 you will be able to do that and then take an Aurelia Web Component into a non-Aurelia app and use it, the same way you would use a Polymer element. We haven&#x27;t done that yet because we are focused on the application experience first and foremost.",1422489740

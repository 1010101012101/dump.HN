The level of harassment you put up with is obscene, and that you continue to stick to your guns in the face of it is admirable. That said, it's not something that most people want in their lives. Many people just want to pursue their interests, develop their career, and raise a family. Dealing with the level of harassment you face imperils all of those goals. Unless someone is dedicated to a cause and willing to sacrifice a lot to serve it, it's unreasonable to ask them to invite that kind of drama into their lives.<p>I respect what you do, but I think it's unfair and myopic to label as ""cowards"" anyone who doesn't share your commitment.<p>On an unrelated note, does this mean the FBI will be serving pg with a warrant for our info?",1302472388

2430481,comment,2430000,2430305,4,0,roel_v,,,"That doesn't make sense. If I gave a tire factory saw dust, would they make tires? Of course not. The question here is: from what point on does processing some material constitute 'making' the end product? One could debate endlessly about this, because it's a boring definition question. Honey is widely considered to be made by bees, and I guess you could make the point that everybody else is wrong and that your definition of 'make' is the right one; fine, but I'm not going into that discussion. The broad consensus is that flowers produce nectar, which is then processed by bees into honey, and in common usage of the word 'make', that means that bees 'make' honey.<p>The difference between store-bought honey and the honey straight from the hive is minuscule, depending on the product in stores you compare it with. Here in Europe, it's against the law to call honey with added sugar 'honey'; that means that what you buy in a store in a jar labeled 'honey' is exactly what comes out of the hive. In many other places it's not regulated and there you can honey watered down with sugar (but that's usually all that's done to it, not processed further). When you compare '100% pure honey' from a store and the honey that comes out of the hive, the difference between the two is purely mechanical; it's just filtered to take out lumps and honeycomb, and that's it. The difference between nectar and honey is much greater - they are fundamentally chemically different. So it's much more of a difference as you make it out to be.<p>Also, honey is never 'cooked', because once it gets over (IIRC) 37 degrees Celsius, it looses much of its healthy properties because the enzymes break down after that.",1302471519

2430478,comment,2428768,2429802,8,0,jschreuder,,,"I think you got him wrong. We've been at this for some time now and did some heavy development on this. Sometimes a person comes in and comments with a single line like ""I WANT MORE NAMESPACES"" and seems to assume that we picked our current setup without giving it a second thought. When someone comes around and all they can say is something as unmotivated and useless as that we won't have a lot of time for the assumption we didn't think of it.<p>If you completely disagree that's fine, move on to something else then - no hard feelings either way I hope. Just don't assume we just created this at random. Dan's remark was spot on, we chose the way we handle namespaces and autoloading very deliberately and we'll take the time to explain our motivations if you ask. But if you come in telling us that our setup sucks because we should be all-something because product X has that as well: don't expect we'll spend any time on you.

2430473,comment,2429962,2429962,2,0,shortformblog,,,"I feel like I have pretty good insight on this issue.<p>I actually use both. WordPress is my backend for Tumblr. I run a news blog called ShortFormBlog ( <a href=""http://shortformblog.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shortformblog.tumblr.com/</a> ), which has content that works well on Tumblr but requires a more robust approach in terms of the creation of the content due to the fact that the posts tend to be more graphical in nature. Which is where WordPress comes in.<p>It has a lot of benefits. When breaking news happens, I don't have to cover every piece of the story  I can reblog the missing pieces from other news Tumblrs. And if I want to do more detailed posts, I can switch back to my customized WordPress backend, which has a modified version of TinyMCE and Tumblrize to allow me to do more design-heavy posts. I also get to keep an archive of the stuff that took more time so it's held in a non-centralized place.<p>The overall benefit? At 6,000 followers and counting in just six months, I have a much larger audience than I ever did with the WordPress site. There's much more communication with readers, and since it's centralized as opposed to all over the place, it's easier to latch onto. I also have gotten some media coverage from Mashable and Mediaite, and I've even worked with the Tumblr staff on some things.<p>WordPress has its uses, but Tumblr has major advantages that you can't get with a self-hosted site. The community is there and it's been well-nurtured. That's as good a reason as any to give it your attention.",1302471300

Nearly all educational institutions make math seem like something only weirdos could enjoy, for their later employment as tools of industry.<p>I say that as someone who was once so motivated to learn math, I lied to a highschool precalculus teacher in order to take proof-oriented calculus at a university. (Though she thought she forebade me, I gained prerequisites in a summer-school, running as fast through the material as I was allowed, passing the maximum 3 tests per day  one test per chapter  once I hit my stride. This allowed me to take classes at a university with a highly regarded undergrad math program).<p>Yet... the university class was boring. Producing ""rigorous"" epsilon-delta proofs (and whatever else we did) was a tedious exercise which improved my abilities in no significant way. Probably made me dumber. I took only one more math class after that. All of it was a waste of time. Didn't ""teach me how to think better"" or any of that paternalistic claptrap.<p>I wish you did not blame your students for their ""bad attitude."" I sincerely don't mean to be rude, but maybe your attitude could also use some modification.

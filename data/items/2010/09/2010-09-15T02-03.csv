1693124,comment,1692932,1692932,0,0,pan69,,,"I believe this to be a very serious issue. Having worked with both designers who not only understand HTML/CSS but actually build their OWN designs and designers who don't have a clue about how websites are build I can tell the difference is huge. I believe the problem is not just whether designs can or cannot be build, I believe it's more about if designs can be build within an estimated timeframe and budget. Designers who don't understand how websites are build seem to come up with monstrosities of designs that never can be build within budgets and timeframes. Sure, the designs look good. As a poster or a flyer but we're building websites here... Designers who do not understand how websites are build seem to design every single website as a massive bitmap. I've had to build 5 megabyte home pages simply because a designer didn't understand the medium. The client wasn't very happy when they where slapped with a massive bill at the end of each month because of the amount of bandwidth the site was using. Don't get me started on gradients and the fact that a browser can have different sizes or the fact that a design needs to be ""pixel perfect"" (which seems to be impossible to understand for some designers).<p>Being a ""web designer"" and not knowing HTML/CSS is just plain stupid.

I'm attending my second year at my uni and I only need ~200-300 per month to manage transportation to and from each month.  I'm a programmer/designer/philosopher/bioinformatics nerd.  My schedule varies too much to get a regular part time job.<p>I started down the path of niche sites.  Devoting a ridiculous amount of time into writing articles for them.  A quick glance of webmaster tools has me ranked 1-4 on some 200-1.4k+ searched keywords each day.  Generally, I went whitehat on the Adsense to assure my account stays alive.  Generally, I receive a click every 4000-9000 views because I try not to fool/force people into clicking ads.  This hope doesn't even cover the cost of my linode.  I strayed away in Feb and venture back to check in on it every once in a while.<p>I figured I would write an ebook and sell it through ClickBank and self advertising (twitter/facebook).  My ebook was too much like a real book.  The information was too specific, required too much non-general knowledge, and users strayed away once they saw the preview.  Looking back: the price was too low too (gasp).  I wrote nearly 300 pgs and ended up with maybe enough to cover the coffees I inhaled while writing it.<p>So, recently, I joined the Fiverr community.  I offer up a few shady SEO techniques.  I've completed 3 offers and made a whopping $12.  After those initial 3, all positive feedback, I've received 0 interest.<p>I considered offering tutoring of some type, but that's really not my field.  I'm not social enough for that nonsense.

Most will flop, or we would all be doing it.  Even if you build a webapp of some type, you still need users.  Even if you write a book, you need readers.  Even if you build a niche site, people ignore ads for the most part (except the people who have used Adsense and realize its somewhat beneficial).  Find a basic need, fill it, they will come (if they can find it); and if your product/service is worth it: you will profit.  Otherwise, prepare to sell yourself to survive for now.

By the same token, there are similar shortcuts on Android which you probably have yet to discover. Holding the search button to voice dial would be one option, like the other poster in this thread said. On HTC devices, there is a favorites widget, so that potentially you could be calling one of your favorites in merely one click.<p>Another thing is that Android's extensibility automatically lends itself to your being able to customize your personal user experience in a vast multitude of different ways. If you really wanted to maintain the ""hold the home button and get contacts"" behavior of the iPhone, for example, you could replace the stock launcher with a third-party application like ADW.Launcher or Launcher Pro and then modify the home button behavior.",1284516894

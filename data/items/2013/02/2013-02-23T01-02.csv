5268175,comment,5265107,5267744,1,0,fennecfoxen,,,"The main problem with the Fairness Doctrine is it's a limitation on freedom of speech. This is something that Americans can be <i>quite</i> sensitive to, more than Europeans, if we'd like to talk about people having blinkers on. :)<p>The Fairness Doctrine was designed in 1949 to ""provide adequate coverage of public issues"", and when challenged in court it was judged constitutional specifically because the radio and television airwaves were limited. With expanding sources of media, including cable television and the Internet, the availability of broadcast airwaves no longer presents a substantial limitation on Americans being able to access any given point of view.<p>Modern attempts to revive the fairness doctrine are led more or less exclusively by partisans who favor the Democratic Party and preferred the content of political speech under the old system. (For example, Bill Clinton stated that he supported it ""because essentially there's always been a lot of big money to support the right wing talk shows."") Many of these partisans would like to apply the doctrine to cable television and other non-public-airwave broadcast media. However, court rulings made it quite explicit that if they ever found that the doctrine was limiting political speech, it would be found unconstitutional, so it is likely all of these attempts will fail even if legislated or regulated.<p>Neutrality and ""fairness"" is, of course, impossible to judge objectively. Just ask any Wikipedia administrators dealing with edit wars. ;) Government regulation of ""fairness"" and government domination of the media have the potential to present significant limitations on political freedom - look at various South American dictators' and their forays into controlling the media and bullying opposing points of view. It is the fox guarding the henhouse. Of course, sometimes you may have relatively benevolent foxes (I hear the BBC's okay!) or you may just have suicidal hens who fawn over the latest bit of personality-cult politician voluntarily (no further comment on this topic, this post is enough of a digression).",1361584562

I have posted here before how the stack ranking part is actually low on my list of objectionable things about the whole process, but it is what people know so it is what people cite. I have heard stories, always apocryphal, never by anyone willing to put their real name behind it, about how people are constantly obsessed with reviews and stabbing their teammates in the back left and right to get a leg up. I have never once witnessed that behavior or even heard of a remotely plausible instance of that happening. That said Microsoft is a big company, so I am sure it has/does happen somewhere. I dispute it is rampant or common.<p>I have heard stories of people that are terrible at working in groups and don't do well. I have heard stories of people that have an opinion of their own skills that seems objectively divorced from reality. I have heard stories of management hubris that ultimately doesnt pan out. Some of the people that play a starring role in these dramas then invent conspiracies about plotting colleagues causing them to rank poorly, incompetent managers that didnt recognize their delicate snow-flakism or any other number of explanations that conveniently dont attribute any share of the blame to themselves. I suspect those tend to be fantasies made to soothe ones ego.<p>I think anyone with knowledge of internal state at Microsoft could posit a much better explanation of why they have 'flopped in just about every field it's entered for the last decade' that doesn't involve Machiavellian competition between employees.

(See: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/gervais-rehash-part-iii-markov-and-management-plus-a-4th-culture/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/gervais-rehas...</a> .)<p>Functioning planned culture: guild culture. Master crafts(wo)men and apprentices are clearly defined, but the managerial relationship is advisory and focused on mentorship. The major downside of guild culture (the rarest of the 4) is that it relies on employee loyalty to capture the value it generates.<p>Pathological planned culture: rank culture. (This is the most common corporate culture.) People rise or fall based on subordinacy, rather than the quality of their ideas or their level of effort. You end up with a lot of people who don't work hard because they realize that effort doesn't matter, and a lot of bad ideas getting into implementation. Rank cultures often can't compete on an open market or address new challenges.<p>Functioning market culture: self-executive culture. Here you have a flat hierarchy and employees have a lot of autonomy. However, they're usually expected to take responsibility for their own advancement. This is the Valve-style open allocation culture.<p>Pathological market culture: tough culture. High-stakes performance reviews, low trust of employees but similarly low guidance. This is the sink-or-swim culture.<p>Rank culture tends to turn into tough culture as it generates underperformers, and eventually the higher-ups get upset about the whole thing and have a crackdown. However, tough culture turns back into rank culture as the people who control the performance assessment become the new rank-holders and, in exchange for loyalty, offer safety and advantage in the evaluation process. So tough and rank cultures tend to fall into a degenerate, enervating pattern of oscillation from one extreme to the other. This back-and-forth eventually exhausts the company, leading to constant reorganization and turmoil.<p>When a company institutes permanent tough culture (stack ranking as an inflexible pillar, rather than a temporary measure) the political corrosion associated with rank culture still occurs, but there's a selection dynamic (similar to antibiotic resistance) where the forms of rank culture that survive are the least detectable. So you end up with a culture that's politicized and gamey like a tough culture, but inefficient and extortive like a rank culture, and ultimately you have a workplace where people put in lots of hours and apparent sacrifice, but there's little getting done and there's no vision.",1361583735

DNS amplification attacks require that the size of the response be much larger than the size of the query (which is why it's an ""amplification"" attack).  Right now amplification attacks query for the same large response via lots of different open resolvers.  However, I suspect the majority of authoritative servers out there only ever return small responses, which would limit the number of servers an attacker could use in an amplification attack.  Furthermore, the attacker would need to tailor a specific query for each server rather than using the same query for all of them, making the attack more difficult to pull off.",1361583663

Claim:  There is in effect a rule not to be violated:  Whenever content passes through a video camera, the work must be under the control of a producer, director, writer, set designer, camera operator, and, if not 'live', editor all with the techniques and values of entertainment TV and Hollywood.  Proof:  Look at the video clips done for high school math and science.  Done.  I know of only one exception, the 30 minutes or so on plane geometry done by A. Gleason with some help from T. Apostol.<p>In one step more detail, the main technique of TV is from formula fiction.  The interview in question?  Sure:  Notice that the interviewer kept returning to the issue of what she sensed was the 'drama' and 'evil' of the situation of hundreds of young entrepreneurs who enter accelerators but end up with businesses worth $0.00.<p>Why the drama?  A central pillar of formula fiction is drama from the threat of evil.  E.g., just now in my computer's DVD burner is a CD of the Puccini opera 'Tosca' with the two lovers, sung by di Stefano and Callas, and then too soon facing the evil Scarpia.  Sure:  I can like light entertainment when it has singing of Puccini by di Stefano and Callas!  What is on TV shows on finance is closer to 'Tosca' than to Black-Scholes, the Sharpe capital asset pricing model (CAPM), how portfolio rebalancing in an index fund works, tests for Brownian motion, or how James Simons made so much money.<p>Am I the only one saying that TV is so bad?  No:  Recall the N. Minow statement that TV is a ""vast wasteland"".  And recall the explanation from M. McLuhan ""the medium is the message"", that is, the narrow bandwidth of the then few TV channels ensured that the best ROI on that bandwidth was essentially one size fits all light entertainment.<p>Of course, Graham and Hornik kept talking about the challenge of seeing the future.  Well, with the above, let's now do some of that:  One size fits all doesn't fit.  It never did fit very well.  It doesn't fit in shoes, shirts, restaurants, home furnishings, cars, or personal interests.  Instead, with more variety, can get on average better fits.  So, there is value in more variety.<p>Can we have that variety?  Well, with the Internet McLuhan's limited bandwidth of the TV ""medium"" essentially no longer applies.  Instead we are free to have highly specialized content for particular personal interests.  So, we can have specialized blogs, fora (not that I can think of any just now), long tail Web sites, etc.  And maybe eventually I will be able to get some good lectures in quantum mechanics, that emphasizes both the physics and the mathematics, the actual, 100% genuine, died in the wool mathematics, hopefully from a guy who actually knows what a Hilbert space is.  It would also be good for him to know what a random variable is, if that's not too much to ask.",1361582375

Many more programmers these days probably get their start with ""scripting"" languages like Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and JavaScript.

(Of course, I'm aware that there is very active implementation work going on for several of those languages that is probably doing a good deal to close the gap.) On average, though, CL is probably in the same ballpark as Java, and can sometimes be made as fast as C or C++ with a lot of effort.<p>Also, note that Common Lisp is very much a many-implementation language (in contrast to languages like the ones above that, for most of their history, were defined by their single implementation), and different implementations make difference performance trade-offs. For much of recent history, the very high performance CL implementations have been somewhat out of reach of the typical student, hobbyist, or other weekend hacker that probably makes up most of the Lisp community. Commercial CLs are quite expensive, and high-performance free CLs like CMUCL have historically not been too friendly to beginners. When I came to Lisp, it seemed much easier to get started with CLISP (an extremely portable bytecode-compiled implementation) than with CMUCL.

5267984,comment,5264312,5267574,3,0,klibertp,,,"I think this - I mean the ""meaning of better"" being obvious or not - is a major difference between most of industry and academia. In academia code readability matters less, it's asymptotic performance matters more and constants can be safely ignored. Reimplementations of things tend to be rewarded, because it shows the student's understanding. It's completely different in the ""real world"".<p>And this is why looking at actual code someone wrote is a good idea - because there are things one cannot check during the interview, like how well the candidate structures the code, how well he writes comments, how does he manage the complexity of a growing codebase, how quickly he can learn a new library or tool and so on.<p>In this particular case I'd probably know that ""doing better"" means algorithmic complexity, but I would never come up with ""but I can do better"" remark myself. It's also possible that, when asked to ""do better"", the first thing I'd try to do would be to write unit tests and docstrings. Is this unacceptable? Would I be seen as an asshole or prima donna?<p>Also, there's an issue of me being able to come up with a ""correct"", ""better"", faster in terms of Big-Oh algorithm. I am not a genius, I know this. I am not and I can not hope to become Dijkstra. I'm also not a computer scientist. I worked hard to be able to read and understand and then code algorithms presented in papers, but I'm damn sure I couldn't come up with even the simplest of them. For example just last week I had to implement a scheduling algorithm called ""highest response ratio next"". I was able to look it up in the sources, understand it and implement it in a product, but I am sure as hell that I would not invent it during an interview. Does it mean that I'm not qualified for a job? Would I be seen as dumb?<p>Posts like danielweber wrote above make me nervous. It's probably not what he had in mind, but it seems to me like he would not hire me - and I work in ""the industry"" for almost ten years now and I have been programming for twenty. I can brush this off as irrelevant - I have a job that I'm proud of and happy with, but what a young, aspiring programmer has to feel when he gets told that he's no good, no hire, because he can't invent algorithms on the spot?",1361581356

When I did my first Startup (that failed) I was trying to do something that was Fun. After experiencing failure and learning my lesson(s), I realized that Fun is not necessarily the best focus to build a business. My second attempt (which is where I am now) has a focus on Value, which has been much more successful. I believe that Value is directly determined by what pain points you solve, and how many people they affect. In many ways I've had to train myself to identify the biggest pain points that fall within my experience/knowledge, and just go for it!! I'm a designer, but as a technical co-founder, I put a strong emphasis on Product Vision, Business Models, and solving Big Problems. The bottom line, anything is possible. We just have to identify what needs to be built, and build it! I'm learning how to code, but I've realized that team work makes the dream work. So right now my goal is to build a few strong founding teams for a few of my highly ambitious ideas. I am experimenting with a new concept (a team building exercise) that shares similarities with some of the new Studio Startup models people are using. I will be essentially 'CrowdFounding' the Projects, open to anyone that can execute. Hopefully I can succeed and solve some of these huge problems I've identified (mostly related to Infrastructure and Security)",1361581244

5267975,comment,5264312,5264312,1,0,sytelus,,,"Some of the best hiring strategy I've came across is indeed ""test driving"". Take a challenging problem your team has, slim it down and ask candidate to do some quick prototype during a weekend. No interviews, puzzles or whiteboarding :). If you were going to fly down a candidate on-site for a day of interviews instead, it's going to take same time anyway considering logistical effort on candidate's part.<p>Test-driving, however, is unfortunately neither scalable nor ""leak proof"". As soon as one candidate gives away your test drive question, the next candidate could easily cheat away inflating their apparent awesomeness compared to other better candidates.<p>However it would be incorrect to write down all whiteboarding interviews as ""evil"". Like any other interviewing techniques, it really depends on how you do it. A good whiteboarding question that allows candidate to use CS fundamentals to solve fairly non-trivial problem that you also needed to solve for your current work is a great question. There are 3 major reason why this doesn't work as expected at some large companies:<p>1. Interviewers can't think of good whiteboarding question and fall back to commonly asked popular puzzles. These interviewers are also often the ones who have one ""favorite"" question that they would ask everyone. This is absolutely #1 problem why whiteboarding interviews devolves in to secret puzzle marathon. The best questions that interviewer could ask are actually the ones that they needed to solve themselves as part of their work recently. This keeps questions relevant and refreshed regularly. It also allows to compare candidate with themselves and follow the philosophy of hiring people smarter than you. It's however hard because interviewers themselves needs to continue doing something interesting regularly.<p>2. Interviewers provide feedback to each other during the loop. It's not coincidence that if 1st interviewer gives ""hire"", all rest tend to do same at companies where there is no clear policy of not communicating feedback before end of the interview.<p>3. Interviewers don't follow up candidate response by extending question, building on to next level perhaps open ended scenario, asking auxiliary details such as test cases, complexity etc.",1361581218

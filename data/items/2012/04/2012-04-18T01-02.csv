3856082,comment,3855859,3855959,3,0,frankus,,,"To borrow from Joel Spolsky, what this shows you is that you can prove anything with a contrived example. More specifically, for any comparison that isn't night-and-day, you can almost always find a reasonable set of assumptions that leads to your preferred conclusion.<p>> I don't know if Toyota makes such a vehicle<p>They don't, and actually the Prius sits between the Corolla and the Camry in size and features. The cost premium over a Camry is only about $2k, and the fuel economy improvement is more dramatic. (The Camry has substantially more power, but the Prius's flat torque curve probably reduces the real-world difference).<p>Another problem with this analysis is that on the one hand it ignores resale value, but on the other hand assumes that the owner won't keep the car more than a few years. Maybe Priuses have crap resale value, but the author doesn't state that much less back it up.<p>But the biggest problem is that only businesses buy cars this way.<p>People don't buy sports cars because they get them to work faster, and people don't generally buy SUVs because they have to drive off-road to get to the grocery store. People buy cars (or forego them) to tell themselves a story about what kind of person they are (and there are many comical instances where it tells an entirely different story to others).<p>Business do buy cars this way, and if you look at those that do a lot of city driving in an area with even moderately high gas prices (say, Vancouver, with gas at US$5.15 a US gallon), you'll find that, for instance, 90% of the taxis are Priuses.",1334714206

3856065,comment,3851691,3854478,1,0,waterhouse,,,"Also, the students for whom this thing is intended (those who would rather just get the answer) will probably study the calculator, learning how it works and probably learning ways to beat it.  Then we can return to business as usual: students who ""get it"" and reason about the problem will continue to do so; students who just grab for answers will continue to grab for answers; and teachers will be complacent--everyone's getting their results by typing an accurate-enough estimate into the calculator, right?--until people realize what's happening, and this will become one more failed educational experiment.<p>Here's the first approach that occurred to me.  How quickly can you type in estimates, and how accurate do they have to be?  (The first thing I would do with one of these things is find that out, simply for curiosity and control over my tools.)  If, say, it's ""same order of magnitude of the correct answer"", then you just have to guess 1, 10, 100, and so on (maybe .1, .01, etc. if the numbers are small).  If it's ""within a factor of 2"", then you could guess 1, 4, 16, 64, and so on (or something that's easier to type; maybe guess 1 10 100 1000, 4 40 400 4000).<p>It may take a while to do, but if the problem is difficult and frightening, it is easier and safer to apply some brute force strategy like this--even if you had to type ""1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 ..."".  I wouldn't be surprised if the answer-grabbers got really fast at it (1e5 2e5 3e5 ... even handles many digits in more or less constant time).  It would still take longer than a normal calculator, but that would be the case for people who estimated it ""the right way"" too.<p>Maybe you could put in some kind of penalty for repeated wrong guesses, but I'm skeptical.  First, even the students who understand what they're doing will make some wrong guesses, and you don't want to punish them too hard; second, I suspect it would actually be hard to do that: the student can turn the calculator off and on at any time, and I think giving it some non-volatile storage of timestamps of wrong estimates would make the calculator somewhat more complex and expensive than it looks like it's supposed to be.<p>(Actually, I think the ""problem"" of ""misusing"" the calculator is not limited to pure answer-grabbers.  I could see myself respecting the challenge and doing my estimates, then being off by a bit and making a correct estimate that was right next to it, then realizing I could just be lazy about my estimates--truncate everything to [single digit] * 10^n, or whatever--and just make two or three guesses if necessary to cover the relatively wide range.  I might possibly still enjoy the experience or the challenge of making estimates and not considering myself done until I can justify my estimate--just like I enjoy doing this stuff <a href=""http://setgame.com/set/puzzle_frame.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://setgame.com/set/puzzle_frame.htm</a> even though I can write a program to solve those puzzles, or not solve them at all--but if I was bored with the assignment and just wanted to finish it, or <i>annoyed</i> with the people who thought such a calculator was a good idea, then there would be nothing stopping me from using perverse strategies.)<p>Edit: Turns out it is somewhat more complicated.  The degree of tolerance depends on the perceived difficulty of the mental calculation (in particular, transcendental functions give a large room for error). <a href=""http://qamacalculator.com/qama/complicated.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qamacalculator.com/qama/complicated.jsp</a><p>That is kind of an impressive thing, actually.  The way error bounds are determined might be somewhat complicated to work out, and <i>maybe</i> even a determined answer-grabber would have to do a bit of estimating work... I dunno.  Maybe you could figure out that ""as long as there's a sine in the expression, then the error bound is at least this much"".<p>OH MY GOD you would simply take any expression and put ""times sin(89)"" or something in it, something close to 1.  Get your answer, then use that as an estimate for the original thing.  Maybe put in a ton of little transcendental-but-you-know-it's-about-1 expressions in there; maybe you can get your error bounds so wide that you need only guess once.  Now maybe the programming will notice things like that, will give small error bounds for something very close to a known thing like sin 90.  But then put in A * (your expression) * B, where A and B are transcendental expressions whose ratio is very close to 1, but which individually are definitely not 1, and which don't obviously cancel out.  Like e and 2^-1.44.<p>I am, let's say, 95% confident that kids would figure out <i>something</i> that would defeat this.",1334713877

(I'm assuming you're shuffling the IDs and not the individual orders; otherwise, as jsnell points out, it averages out to the pro rata case.)  The main problem I can see is that if someone can get their hands on multiple IDs, they can duplicate their orders across all their IDs and we're back to the pro rata system.<p>Even if you make sure to assign just one ID per trading firm, firms could coordinate to share their IDs.  For example, if you're not using your ID this tick, you might place an order on my behalf for a small fee.  And I'll also have sent some of my orders through an independent broker to take advantage of their ID.  (Of course, if that broker places many such orders, and only some of those fill, they'll need some policy for which of their customers get the trades... maybe they could use time priority?)<p>It's conceivable (if unlikely) that the SEC could enact and enforce a ban on such collusion.

It's true that I can't claim to know a LOT of history about antitrust law. But the reason it's possible to make sense of ""complex systems"" is the use of (correct) principles about how they work, not examining every concrete example ad infinitum and saying, for example, ""well, but maybe the ball will fall up <i>next</i> time"". Anyway, putting aside the philosophisizing, I have more specific comments below.<p><i>It's illegal when I use my monopoly to stop competitors from selling their own widgets</i><p>My point is that your <i>only</i> means to do that is to use government force, i.e., laws.

For example, that doesn't stop others from making their own entirely separate system of interconnecting widgets. Similarly, Apple controlling what's in the App Store doesn't stop Google from creating it's own app store and controlling <i>it's</i> content. One might say that Apple ""has a monopoly on content of the App Store,"" but that's using the term ""monopoly"" disingenuously.<p>This is not supposed to be a complete proof of anything, but it's supposed to suggest my line of thinking.<p><i>If you believe that this situation is impossible, then the law is irrelevant</i><p>Quite the opposite. The law is highly relevant because it's what <i>makes</i> the ""cheating"" possible. For example, if Apple got the government to bad the Google Store.

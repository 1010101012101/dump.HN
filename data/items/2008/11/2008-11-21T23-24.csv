There is this thing that keeps us going, and that thing is very deeep, and is older that our species, and when that thing conflicts with our modern brain, we get confused. What is the meaning of life? Why should i go on? The answer to these questions can't be ""our instincts tell us to"", it doesn't make sense, but it does, actually life is worth just for the living, and we should just go on, because our instincts tell us, they know better, they had billions(not millions) of years to evolve and refine them selfs, our minds have been around for only a few million years, which one should you trust? I have more to live for than what my instincts tell me, but many don't, and they have the power to ignore them, and we have no right to judge them, they overcame the most important of all our instincts with their minds, that takes will, even if its a stupid decision, its a valid one(not always of course).",1227309255

If you love coding, learn Python. If making web apps is just a means to an end for you, learn PHP (and a framework like Code Igniter).<p>Long answer:
If you want to code web apps primarily for the forseeable future, go with PHP and a great backend framework like Code Igniter.<p>If you want to eventually code larger scale backend pieces, and grow into other areas of development, go with Python.<p>I love Python, but have a renewed loss of skepticism for PHP given how well CodeIgniter has performed for some of our major web apps. I personally feel Python doesn't feel as inherently interconnected with web concepts as PHP, so there are more complications/hurdles to get past in order to build a 100% functional/pretty web app. But you'll be much better off long-term for learning Python if you're going into sysadmin/backend/app development.<p>I love coding, so I learned both.

47059,comment,46894,46894,0,0,toffer,,,"The problem with making your blog the hub of your social network is that there is no concept of private groups or private friends for a blog.  Everything is public.  <p>The post gives an example of uploading photos, and then automatically notifying friends via RSS that new photos are up.  Sounds like Facebook, except on Facebook, only my friends could see the photos, not the whole world.<p>I don't think you solve this problem until there is an Internet-wide system for managing your identity.  (Obviously, OpenID and OpenAuth are steps in this direction.)<p>Plus, I also think that it is psychologically more difficult to start a blog than it is to create a profile page on a social network.  With a blog, you have to overcome the ""Blank Canvas Fear"" (""What am I supposed to say?"") and the ""Public Speaking Fear"" (""I'm speaking to the whole world, not just my friends."")  Filling out a Facebook profile and writing on your friend's Wall is a much easier way to start.",1188235660

47055,comment,46981,46981,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm struck by (and commented directly on the blog) how much the author wants ""Extreme Blue"" to be seen as comparable to YC...where the similarities are superficial and the differences are vast.<p>That comment hasn't shown up, so I'll point out the highlights here:<p>- EB encourages kids to build things.  For IBM.<p>- YC encourages people (not just kids) to build things.  For the people building them.<p>- EB teams must have ""business"" and ""technical"" people, selected by a random manager at IBM.<p>- YC teams are self-selected, and are judged by what they produce, not what label they use to describe their abilities.<p>- EB teams build something that may, or may not, ever see the light of day in the market.<p>- YC teams build something that, if they work hard, can hit the market whenever they're ready.  No manager ever has to sign off on the project.<p>In short, EB is a corporate internship and YC is an opportunity to build something great (you don't need YC to build something great, but for many folks it can help).  Corporate internships are fine, and I'm sure everyone has a great time and IBM gets its pick of some great talent discovered through the process, but it is just a corporate inernship.  It is distinctly not a radical new process to encourage spinning up new businesses.<p>I'm not disparaging IBM here.  This sounds like a great idea for them.  But don't pretend it is something that it clearly is not.",1188235145

He built things he wanted, and believed other people wanted too. He was a workaholic and a visionary, and never settled for just good enough. It shows in his work and it shows in the work that happened at Disney after his death. \n",1188235035

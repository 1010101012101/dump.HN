You need to understand the relationship between debt, the currency, interest rates, and a government's ability and willingness to repay.  These factors make government debt potentially VERY risky.<p>Even in the U.S., which is generally very responsible, government debt has been a terrible investment at times through the years.  The U.S. massively devalued during the Great Depression and devalued again after World War Two.  An investment in a U.S. ten-year bond in the late-1960s would have been absolutely creamed, I'm talking about losing much of the real value of your investment.  That's not anyone's idea of safe.",1309449583

(And yes, browsing on it really is <i>awful</i>.)<p>The problem is that there are three types of people:<p>1.) They want the lowest common denominator in tech, the easiest and simplest option, the Nokia 3310.<p>2.) Features, features, features. This letter makes the point that no-one ever choses option A over option B because of an extra feature, and while there is some truth to that...  that is with regard to iPad vs. PlayBook, or iPhone vs. Android. Anyone I've ever known chose an iPhone over a Blackberry has used reasons such as ""better web browsing"", ""a music player that doesn't suck"", ""wider range of better apps"" and so on. And those are hardly subjective, in my opinion anyway. Phonecalls, SMS, BBM, Email, you can't beat a blackberry, pretty much anything else you want to do, even simple things like watching a video or using as an MP3 player, it just sucks at. There are <i>some</i> blackberry apps that are great, for example (in my case) UberSocial for Twitter, and the MLB At Bat app, but those are few and far between.<p>3.) The third type of people are people like me who know exactly what we want, to the extent that we don't mind missing out on the features we could have with a different phone, but don't want simple either. We're pretty rare.<p>The problem is that the first type of person, the features of a blackberry are perfect for them, but using it? It confuses the hell out of my father, who took to an iPhone immediately (and found an Android phone just as easy). If you're not simpler and less confusing, or offering an even comparable range of features, and costing the same, then there's very few people who will chose you - at this point, sexiness of the product is hardly even relevant, that only comes into play if both products would fulfil roughly the same role.",1309449545

I can run Windows on my machine with little difficulty with full driver support for the graphics card, so there is little reason for me to select a non-Apple machine.<p>My specific complaint (whine?) is the difference in performance between Apple's OpenGL and Direct3D 9 on the <i>exact same hardware</i>. I am not qualified to argue more about the limits of particular hardware, drivers, or libraries. But I expect comparable performance between the two.<p>Didn't I start this by saying I don't blame Apple? Go figure.<p>Edit: I can confirm that under Windows my graphics card supports OpenGL 3.2. Under OS X, I only get support up to 2.1 (plus selected extensions). In this case, it <i>is</i> a software issue. It is believed that the next OS X release (Lion) will provide OpenGL 3+ support.

2714508,comment,2713766,2713766,1,0,babul,,,"Unless you root your device, which can invalidate your warranty with most manufacturers and service providers (at least here in UK - hence why many people don't want to do it), and use a app like ShootMe (which I found to be good and also one of the least intrusive in terms of required permissions), taking screenshots on most Android handsets is a pain.<p>You can install the Android SDK (and required dependencies) which includes tools you can use to grab screens, but I found it easier for most people to install a tool like MyPhoneExplorer (which is free, includes ADB, and is very easy for non-technical people to install) and the driver for their phone (usually on the handset itself for many devices e.g. HTC phones) instead. The big benefit is not only does it have a built-in and easy way to take screenshots, but also can be used to backup/restore your phone including all contacts/mms/sms/apps/settings/etc, and can be used for multiple handsets (or you can make different profiles for same handset as a crude version control), different phones e.g. Samsung/HTC/Nokia, and different OS e.g. as used on Nokia/SonyEricson/BB/etc, so makes transfer or CRUD of contacts/mms/sms/etc between devices easy and saves on hassles of having different software suites for different phones.<p>The only solution I have found to take screenshots directly on a mobile without full (permanently) rooting it is to soft root it using the RATC (RageAgainstTheCage) exploit either directly with ADB or far more easily using a tool like UnRevoked. This roots the phone until it is turned off, where upon a restart the phone is once more unrooted.<p>Lastly, if you just want to take screen shots of your website or web-app, you can do it without any rooting by installing the excellent DolphinHD browser and Screen-Cut plugin. This also has added advantage of being able to take full length shots of your page as one screenshot.<p>Note: AFAIK this applies to almost all devices I've seen up to Android Froyo (2.2) and most Gingerbread (2.3) and tablets. Some manufacturers may have implemented their own screenshot system.",1309449138

When you retire around the age of 65, your final pension depends partially on how much you've paid in pension fees in total while working. But you don't set aside that money, instead the pensions fees people pay now are used to pay pensions for retired citizens, and future pensions will be financed by the future workforce.<p>But then you have the ""Premium pension"" which does allow you to set aside part of your pension fee and invest into private funds. Generally the systems is a failure, most people don't care about choosing funds, so they automatically end up in a government run generally mediocre fund. A small percentage are investing soundly and successfully, a larger percentage are investing badly, and most people get screwed by high commission fees of the various funds.<p>On top of these systems there are of course ways to save additional money for your retirement, there are some tax benefits, and you are free to invest pretty much however you want.<p>But yes, it is interesting that we have more privatization than the US in this, it doesn't happen very often. :-)",1309447779

Would multiplication not be invertible with them?<p>Yes, this is exactly why the 16 dimensional sedenions are not in the same category as the others. For it to be a division algebra, you must be able to reverse any multiplication that isn't by zero. This is just the normal concept of division in the real numbers. It also allows us to define division in the complex, quaternion and octonion numbers. However, it is possible to multiply two non-zero sedenions together and get zero. This breaks this property completely.<p>> Is there a possibility of things that are distinct from our concept of numbers but are none-the-less useful being discovered in the future?<p>Absolutely! These four numbers systems are a tiny portion of spaces studied by mathematicians. There are a lot of interesting things that can be said just by generalising a few properties of numbers (e.g. without requiring that we can divide, or without requiring that we have both addition and multiplication). There are groups, fields, rings, algebras, topological spaces, and all sorts of interesting things that aren't 'numbers' as such.",1309447252

Currently, your service won't.

It shouldn't be difficult to map any postcode to a country (Scotland, England etc.) and other larger regions. In cases where it's not 100% possible you could probably return a (potentially incomplete) list of nearby streetnames, towns etc. which could trigger an autocomplete when the user starts typing the first letter. Once they've chosen a streetname then that may in turn dictate the rest.<p>Most of this data could be extracted from OpenStreetmap or directly from the Ordnance Survey Open Data, particularly Code Point and OS Locator, meaning you'd only need users to confirm a street name, and enter a house name or number to get a full record.<p>(It would be nice to allow users to report errors in the OS Locator street names too.

2714299,comment,2713631,2714179,2,0,CaptainZapp,,,"I can't speak for Sweden, but for Switzerland where your pension rests on three pillars. Two of them mandatory and one where you're free to invest, but receive tax benefits if you do:<p>Pillar 1 is called AHV (AVS in French). This is the responsibility of the federal government and there are no plans to privatize this; ever. Since there is a maximum payout, which is quite low it has a certain wealth redistribution component. That is: When you make a lot of money you pay a percentage into the fund, which is a percentage of your earnings. So, a person making a lot of money pays more into it, but since the payout is capped at a fairly low level, he may get the same benefits as somebody who earned much less and thus payed much less into the fund<p>Pillar 2 is the actual pension plan, which is mandatory. Every company must insure their employees and big companies run their own schemes. While those funds are privately run, there are strong restrictions in place how they can invest the money of their insureds. The difference to the AHV is that the payout depends on the amount you payed in over your lifetime as a worker. Payout is based on a formula and the age of retirement can be dependent on the insurer. Employees don't have a choice about which pension plan they have and there are differences in quality. I could imagine that the system in Sweden is comparable (private, but very restricted in how they invest) but must admit that I'm assuming here.<p>Pillar 3, incidentally called pillar 3 (3. Sule) is not mandatory. You can pay a maximum yearly amount into a fund, a bank account or to an insurer (~ 7500$ if employed ~ 38000$ if you're not part of a pillar 2 pension plan) and this amount is fully tax deductible. The string is that you can only get it out when you turn 60. There are ways to get the money out before that. Either when you invest in a house, or apartment or when you leave the country for good. Same goes for the pillar 2 assets accumulated.<p>There's no such thing that a company can legally pull an Enron and invest the assets of their employees into their own company.<p>I know that the Swiss system is considered excellent. The dutch system is considered even better, but I have no expertise to discuss it.",1309446171

It is not something that Apple can choose to implement on less capable hardware. That's almost certainly why both Windows and Mac are running OpenGL 2.1 - OpenGL 2.1 is all the hardware will support.<p>On the other hand, based on your report it appears that NVIDIA has invested more effort in the performance of their Windows driver than in the performance of their Mac driver. Given their economic interests and the fact that many people using their hardware under Windows are NVIDIA customers whereas the vast majority of people using their hardware are Apple customers, it is hardly surprising that they would do so.<p>I will point out that for people who give a high priority to 3d graphic performance, there is little reason to select an Apple product - a meaningful range of hardware options simply does not exist and the drivers simply receive less attention. Keep in mind that one of the major differences between workstation class graphics cards such as NVIDIA's Quadro and gaming cards is the quality of the drivers - the same GPU's are often used in both segments with driver performance justifying much of the cost premium workstation cards command.",1309446136

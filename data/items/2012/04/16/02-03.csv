We have a pretty good reason why they didn't either extend the watertight compartments or use a double hull in the construction.<p>Extending the watertight compartments up into the ship makes passenger movement much harder; a killer for a ship built around luxury.<p>The double hull would have added a lot of weight to the ship.  Titanic's sister ship Britannic required a bigger engine to maintain the same speed and was less economical as a result. Titanic was expected to perform weekly Atlantic crossing over a very long lifetime and the cost would have been substantial.",1334545022

There was an active contingent that thought that the idea of the file wasn't a good thing and we should instead have a massive distributed data base with a micro-structure of some sort. The first (unreleased) version of the Macintosh did not have files. But Unix jumped the fence from the academic to the business world and it had files, and Macintosh ultimately came out with files, and the Microsoft world had files, and basically everything has files. At this point, when we teach undergraduates computer science, we do not talk about the file as an invention, but speak of it as if it were a photon, because it in effect is more likely to still be around in 50 years than the photon.""[1]<p><a href=""http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_lanier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_lanier.html</a>",1334544632

Laser cutters, water-jet cutters, 3D printers, and - perhaps more importantly - the technology to enter a credit card number, press a button, and ship your CAD drawings around the world to a shop in some Chinese city where a team of machinists can whip up a thousand units for small amounts of money.<p>But the way this technology <i>manifests</i> to US consumers is via Kickstarter campaigns.<p>And, sure, if you want to scale any of these Kickstarters up to millions of units you'll need a real manufacturing team and capital.

Recently I went public about being banned from Kickstarter for being a stalking victim. People on Twitter were extremely supportive of me and helped to get the message out. Kickstarter publicly apologized to me and while they did not email me directly at least they made an effort to set things straight. As for the rest of the Internet I have never seen such an epic fail.<p>The story was posted to Reddit and for a small period of time I was receiving support there. This is what happened next. My stalker, like he always does, began posting hundreds of defamatory comments about me via his numerous sock puppet accounts. It appears that the majority of people on Reddit were stupid enough to fall for it. He began linking to old sites which he harassed me on, posting my personal information, posting old emails with his fabricated drama, etc.<p>The same thing happened on Slashdot. I was receiving support until my stalker began his usual harassment campaign against me. Again he linked to old websites that he harassed me on, posted my personal information, posted old emails with his fabricated drama, etc. I always thought that Slashdot was a cut above the rest but apparently I was wrong. People on Slashdot were just as easily pwned. Not only that but the story was marked as hoax and lies.<p>Seriously?<p>At least Hacker News is doing a little better. They appear to have deleted all of his comments. Im still not sure how people on the Internet are this stupid. Obviously if my stalker was able to spam over 300 comments to Kickstarter hed be able to do the same thing to Reddit and Slashdot. This seems like common sense to me. Yet somehow I am the one who is crazy. The level of fail here is so epic I am still in shock. Time to go occupy a few new brain cells.<p>Nice try Mario but your princess is in another castle.",1334544403

There's always good and bad to presenting something like this. On the good side it gets people dreaming - it leaves enough to the imagination for it to seem amazing, for the possibilities to be endless. But unfortunately those things cannot map perfectly to reality, at least not all of them. Having worked on VS, I definitely know I can't build an IDE over night, not by myself, not even with 100's of people. And for some that will take the magic out of it initially. The way to combat that, though, is through transparency I think. I will be very open as the project goes on. I want people to know what we're thinking, what we're working on, and why we're doing it. My hope is that we can sustain a dialog as time goes on about how we as a community of creators go about creating things.<p>Despite the realities though, I will do my absolute best to deliver some of that magic. :)",1334544284

With this input the app would return meal plans, exercise routines and supplements schedules.<p>Nothing I've mentioned so far is patentable - these features are obvious to anyone who has tried to lose weight and already exist online.<p>So what was the patentable bit? Well, the client had devised an algorithm that worked the inputs and emitted the diet recommendations & exercise plans. That he had created in an Excel spreadsheet.

There are a lot of good reasons for that, and I've since found it a good personal policy when working with potential clients - the legal liability incurred by signing an NDA that covers something you don't really know the scope of isn't usually worth it.<p>I hate to beat the 'all ideas are worthless, only implementation matters' drum, but a lot of ideas are pretty worthless. If I had a dollar for every time someone tried to get me to sign an NDA for an idea that was literally ""Build a web page that we can charge people to list their website on."", well, I'd have a lot of dollars. People are generally a lot less clever thank they think they are.<p>That said, I don't think it is too terrible to sign a limited-scope NDA once you have a general idea of what information you might be coming into contact with and are ready to actually start working.

You can be great to the customers but destroy the whole ecosystem.  This is what happens with companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon.<p>Wal-Mart didn't start out destructive.  They become destructive once they were large enough to bend the manufacturing companies to their will.  Amazon has and is doing the same.  And once again, like Wal-Mart before it, the destruction is only seen in the aftermath.  I've shopped at Wal-Mart.  It's convenient and cheap, the same reason I still shop at Amazon (convenience trumps morality for me many times, as it does for a lot of people).  But what you can end up with are corporations that employ a scorched earth policy and will design their business to make little or no money so they can outlive the competitors.<p>And what happens when they win?  Have you ever driven through a small town and seen a vacant Wal-Mart building?  I have.  They end up destroying the market and then leaving because they know people have no choice but to drive 30-45min to the Super Wal-Mart in the next town.  Pure capitalism can easily become parasitic and will kill of the host then move to another.<p>The idea that online is riskier than offline is a joke (competitive yes, but because there is less risk to online).  It's easier now than ever before to start a business, fail, then pivot, pivot, pivot (who even heard of companies pivoting in the 80's).  If offline is so easy why isn't hacker news all about opening up a competitor to Wal-Mart?  I assume by that comment you probably have never started an offline business.<p>The ideal outcome to all this would be for Amazon to remake publishing into a market where the bulk of the profits go to the author/creator.  That would be great to see.  But don't think for a second that what Amazon is doing to the publishers, they won't also do to the authors when the time comes.  And if there is one (or two) dominant ebook reader(s), that is exactly what will happen.  But in your eyes that would be alright because Amazon is making it cheaper for the customer.",1334543116

I think the demo you created was incredibly impressive, and I suspect a lot of people will therefore expect a <i>lot</i> from this product.  This is going to sound overly pessimistic, so please forgive me - but I suspect that, as time goes on - and it will, because to me the goals of this project seem <i>huge</i>, and the problems you're attempting to solve seem hard - you'll probably cop a bit of backlash over the time taken, not living up to expectations, etc.<p>I hope that if that happens, you're able to ignore it and keep working on it anyway.  Regardless of whether you accomplish your goals or not, I'll happily be throwing some money into the kickstarter and crossing my fingers for you guys, because the actual idea behind this is awesome.",1334541726

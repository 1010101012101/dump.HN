Sarah's brand of humour is based on shock and blatant unabashed selfishness. It clearly shows the difference between using a 'politically incorrect' word a few times and being genuinely offensive.<p>Using the word 'retard' as an insult (the way you just did) doesn't just insult the person being referred to - it implies that people who are actually retarded have something to be ashamed of.<p>I understand why the audience may have been outraged by the jokes (i.e. adopting a vulnerable child for self-aggrandisement).

I want to switch to something that feels more secure, something that does email well without any of the extra junk they have been adding to my Gmail account.  I don't seem to be alone.<p>I consulted several friends with more ""tech cred"" than me, and they pointed me to a few Gmail alternatives, with Fastmail at the top of the list.<p>I went to your website and after browsing for about a minute, I wanted to scratch Fastmail off my list.  Your website came across as clunky, cold, and BLAH.  It seemed like the website was designed about five years ago, and it didn't really instill confidence that your service would be a user-friendly experience or something that I could transition to without a huge amount of effort.<p>I decided to check out another Gmail alternative on my list called ""Roundcube"".  The Roundcube site was simple but elegantly designed.  More importantly, it didn't feel like it was trying to put me to sleep.  The site laid out its features via simple navigation structure, basic colors, a nice screenshot, and a non-cluttered layout.  I wanted to hug it.  It gave the vibe that they offered an email service that would make the transition away from Gmail extremely painless and straightforward.<p>I relayed my thoughts to a techie friend, and he reiterated that your service is far superior to Roundcube.  I trust my friend, and I will probably sign up for an account with you.<p>But seriously...  There are so many people out there right now who desperately want to break free of their Gmail shackles.  The moment is ridiculously ripe for another service to step into that vacuum and offer a refuge to all of these people.<p>Your email service might be truly awesome, but your website is total cryptonite for people who are ready to make the switch.<p>Welcome us with open arms, and we will come in droves!!<p>Sincerely yours,<p>Volto Libro",1266180935

Here's some of the courses and concepts I liked about MY business education:<p>- Case studies: in accounting/biz analysis class, we learned by studying fictional and real case studies, from jewelery startups started by 2 former students to mid-sized soda manufacturing companies. You get a background about the founders, some key market factors, relevant prices and financial figures, etc. You then come up with your own conclusions and rationalize why, and present your findings under a Socratic teaching environment.<p>Strategy course + game simulation: The strategy game was a lot of fun, you get together with your group and try to take over the shoe business by building factories in 4 continents, setting prices, budgets, R&D, etc. It also based its currencies against real world currencies. Every week, you got your results and tried to out-compete other groups.<p>Operations: My ops prof worked in consulting and bragged to clients that if he couldn't find a way to save you money in 20 mins, he'd consult for free. He dives straight into the books and starts crossing out inventory. Why? Inventory takes storage space, heat, security, insurance. Ops is largely inapplicable to web startups because it deals with tangibles. But I still liked learning about it.<p>I would say business schools aren't really for the hacker/entrepreneur mindset. They are generally for people who want careers in management.",1266180891

If they could build or run a multimillion dollar businesses would they be teaching?</i><p>Several of the better teachers at my university had consulting gigs on the side where they worked on real world projects that interested them.  A few had worked many years in industry and now wanted to do something different.  Some genuinely preferred the more theoretical and research aspect of the field and felt that a university was the best place to foster that.  And yes a few where useless, could probably never cut in industry and just hung around because for some reason no one had fired them yet.<p>Conversely, having running a business will teach you many things, but there are other things you can only learn by having studied and carefully analysed and compared hundreds of businesses and the people who work there.  So just because you have never run a business yourself doesn't mean you have nothing to teach, and just because you happened to be in charge of a business that happened to successful doesn't mean you know all there is about all aspects of running a company.",1266180469

The bottom 50% of earners pay 3.3%.<p>So while Buffet may be paying a smaller percentage than his secretary, it’s fifth grade mathematical knowledge that percentages are normalized values. When you look at the total magnitude of taxes paid, the rich are paying a <i>massively</i> disproportionate share. The Wikipedia article says that when the percentage of revenue from each bracket is compared with the wealth distribution rate, it lines up very closely. That is, the top 5% pay 57.1% of the taxes and have 57.2% of the wealth.

The comments made about MBAs seeing people as ""tools"" is spot on and in recent years the organization behavior subject has made a lot of progress in reversing this damaging trend, started during the industrial revolution.<p>On the other hand, entrepreneurship is all about taking an invention and turning it into an innovation and a sustainable company, and in the process mitigating various business risks (e.g. is there anyone to buy the product, how to make the product, what product to make, etc.). The two (startups vs. companies) are fundamentally different (I elaborate on this here: <a href=""http://www.deyanvitanov.com/entrepreneurship-foundations/startups-vs-companies.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deyanvitanov.com/entrepreneurship-foundations/sta...</a>). Very few business schools make the claim to be catering to the entrepreneurial crowd, and even fewer do it well - I can speak only for Stanford GSB, although I have heard similar for Berkeley and Babson, among others I am sure.<p>So the comment about talking the talk and walking the walk sounds nice, but the assumptions behind it simply fall flat.<p>FYI, I have an MBA from Stanford and I am basing my comment on my experience there.

It's also a nice showcase for what's possible in CoffeeScript.<p>For example, take a peek at the Jison parser, using a little DSL function that makes for a nice style of grammar declaration:<p><a href=""http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/grammar.coffee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/src/gr...</a><p>If you'd like to play with the CoffeeScript-in-CoffeeScript implementation, use bin/node_coffee when you check out the source. bin/coffee remains the Ruby implementation until the CoffeeScript side is up to feature parity.<p>Here's the original post, things have come a long way since then:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1014080"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1014080</a>",1266179400

If the government is giving out loans like candy, schools don't mind hiking the tuition higher and higher every year (well beyond the level of inflation).<p>I noticed that with my school. I was in graduate and under-graduate school at the same university. I was there for 7 years. The tuition kept going up at an enormous pace and the school just stared building stadiums, shopping areas, recreation centers and other seemingly useless stuff. Incoming students and their parents had to take higher and higher loans.<p>I graduated without any loans and we payed my wife's loans in 2 years but that is definetly not the norm.<p>Producing graduates that are enslaved to paying back giant loans makes less able to competitively choose work places (they can't quit a job they don't like as easily because they have to keep paying another, rather large monthly bill).",1266177661

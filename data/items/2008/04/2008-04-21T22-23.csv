The Wufoos are on a mission from God, and you really don't want to get in the way of people like that (you can see what happened to all the cops chasing Jake and Elwood...those guys never stood a chance).  Wufoo is kinda like that.<p>It seems pretty obvious to me that pg's talk was exactly about what makes Wufoo such a terror.  They have a near infinite supply of morale built right into how they approach their business...they can't fail because it would never cross their mind to accept failure because what they're doing is The Right Thing--as long as they do The Right Thing, they have succeeded.  And as long as they have that approach and you don't, you wouldn't want to try to beat them in their space.

170018,comment,169689,169689,0,0,greatapps,,,"Dear All, as the originator of the blog post that has sparked this thread may I begin by apologising for my sloppy spelling errors on the post, which I've corrected and thanks for highlighting them.  However, to correct some of the misunderstandings and prejudices of other contributors to this thread<p>- I was testing the add-in using BUSINESS email and sadly have too many attachments on incoming emails from people who don't use online collaboration services.<p>- I've never tended to use an email inbox to store documents, preferring windows file folders instead. Hence the attachments get saved off on receipt. Personally I always found Outlook quite flaky as a file storage system and would also hate to rely on remembering who sent which document.<p>- I had to test Xobni on a family desktop as I've migrated away from Outlook for all my work activities and Xobni only works in Outlook.  Why pay licence fees when you can use identical services online for free and access them from anywhere?  Hence, I simply downloaded business emails onto the home machine to test over a couple of weeks.<p>- Google desktop search is what I use to find anything on a PC, albeit most of my docs get stored in the ""cloud"" these days.  Hence, Xobni ""search"", which is restricted to Outlook content, was superfluous.<p>- As for the photo comments, sadly it's the face I was born with and the photo was taken by Ian Forrestor of BBC Backstage fame at the London BBC Backstage & Geek party in 2006. That my opinion is diminished coz you don't like my picture...........wow, tough crowd<p>- Oddly enough, I was writing as a past Xobni user and of my experience of the product - my comments had nothing to do with being an investor.<p>- I'm delighted that some people could derive use from this product.  Evidently we have considerably different needs or have settled on alternate solutions.",1208817935

170007,comment,169715,169958,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"The problem with most ""traditional"" RDBMSs is that they were not designed with modern web server environments in mind. In order to scale to handle the frequent and speed sensitive requests needed to serve web pages, techniques such as sharding or clusting are used to spread data across multiple DB instances. When you do this, you lose much of the traditional RDBMS functionality such as being able to join or order. Without this, how much do we really need SQL anymore?<p>It also makes for a scaling nightmare for startups who's #1 scaling issue is typically DB related.<p>In this respect traditional SQL is starting to show its age. My prediction is it will begin to become phased out for most web application purposes in favor of more easily scalable cloud-based and services such as SimpleDB and BigTable.",1208817222

So, there's this somewhat smug notion that Mac users are arbiters of quality and taste and the only honest computer users in existence...but there are different means of valuing software than money.<p>And, saying that Windows users are universally pirates is simply disingenuous.

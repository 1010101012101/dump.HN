The developers decided that adding mechanism to it to prevent piracy is wasted money. And they were right because everybody I know bought it and the is/was a huge success.<p>Mechanism to prevent piracy are so expensive that it is not worth the money. Plus in the and the game will get cracked anyway and that means all the money you put into it was just useful for a short time.<p>Another thing about preventing piracy methods is that in most cases the paying customer are losing. I buy a game for 50 bucks from Capcom and can't play it cause they wanted to prevent piracy with a phone-home DRM. This is ridiculous.",1305187112

something good per se. It's just better than code generation tools in
Java. Well, monkey patching is even worse.<p>Why is this even needed? What is missing in the programming language

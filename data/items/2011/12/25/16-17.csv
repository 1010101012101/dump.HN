3391220,comment,3389678,3389678,2,0,mark_l_watson,,,"I was in Japan a year ago and it is interesting to compare things with my country (USA) as far as living conditions: in Japan I saw no homeless people. They keep their roads and parks in beautiful pristine condition. People there didn't seem so friendly to foreigners (but I don't speak the language) but the impression I got was that people in Japan had a contented look (sorry for the generalization, but that was a general feeling I had, being there). My only disappointment with Japan is that I thought that many people in Japan play Go (I love the game) and I talked to no one who played. I should have looked harder for a public Go club.<p>In my country, we are closing public parks, in many locations the roads are in very bad shape, the fraction of people in college has drastically decreased in the last two decades, many businesses are closing, etc. We have problems just like other countries.<p>It seems common to diss on other countries. I view my country as being as good a place to live as other prosperous developed countries. Thinking that we are ""special"" is a mistake. I think that the author's main point is that we have been ""propagandized.""",1324832335

I'm not totally sure about future changes in that regard. So far, all the 'ohhhh my god, we're killing jobs/innocent children' arguments fail to explain why a new way to regulate the internet is needed. I'm not allowed to download the latest movies, period. If I'd do that, I'm gambling. If I (since this tends to be conflated with theft a lot) go to my local video shop (yep, these still exist) and manage to steal a dvd, I'll be punished if you catch me. Just like - with the current anti-piracy legislation.<p>Writing this down I realize that I'd be hard-pressed to support this kind of legislation, really. This is coming from someone that buys a metric ton of things 'to support' people (currently I'm hunting for a decent site that lets me buy the remake of Another World, after the flashback I got from the discussion on HN).",1324831920
3391206,comment,3389678,3389718,8,0,dshaw002,,,"I lived in Japan for two years in a rural/semi-urban area. It was only about 2 hours from Tokyo, so I have seen the difference between urban and rural life.<p>Two things come to mind with this:<p>1) The huge divide between big business and small business. There are so many small businesses in Japan that don't scale. They run from small run-down shops run by old people to super-trendy, artisan shops run by young people. Most of these younger people just want to run a small artisan-type business, they're not interested in being a part of the next big thing, or going public, looking for investor backing, etc.. These businesses are essentially confined to a community and neighborhood. The largest I've seen is one that spreads across the prefecture.<p>On the other end, you have the zaibatsu/keiretsu, which are run by oligarchies (Mitsubishi, etc.). A lot of young businesses talent is driven to these companies because they run essentially everything. I feel like this is what's driving the economy, and it's also not a part of the consciousness of the everyday Japanese person.<p>2) Japan's global stance. Japan is very traditional and modern in very awkward and confusing ways. People may have high definition TVs, but they live in hundred-year old houses with antiquated heating systems.<p>A friend once told me that Japan may be inefficient or wrong in some ways, but Japanese people like it and want it that way, and they are willing to work hard for it.<p>I feel like maybe the whole Japanese economic boom was some type of fluke. It was an odd advantage that a naturally introverted society had, and the economy is just going back to the way it was always supposed to be. I don't know if they're supposed to have a large economy, or really want one if it comes with a certain price.<p>Do you guys get what I'm saying?",1324831873

3391199,comment,3389678,3390797,1,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>Japan has the highest suicide rate among youth across all industrialized nations</i><p>I'd like to know what source you have for this statement, because the last time I checked the issue with World Health Organization figures, the statement you just made was incorrect. The WHO figures are stratified by age groups (which, if followed over time in WHO annual reports, can be tracked as age cohorts), and although Japan has long had a higher AGGREGATE suicide rate than the United States, manifested especially in a high rate of suicide by the elderly (age cohorts born before World War II), it has often in my lifetime had a lower YOUTH suicide rate than the United States. Moreover, in many of the postwar decades the youth suicide rate in Japan was declining while the youth suicide rate in the United States was rising.<p>Here's a little snippet of a FAQ I prepared in the 1990s to show the youth suicide trend for the United States to that decade: ""In the United States, recent studies suggest that between 5 and 10 percent of adolescents have made suicide attempts . . . Suicide is currently the third leading cause of death among 15-to-24-year-olds, . . . Moreover, this incidence has increased threefold from the 1950s to the 1980s (Berman & Jobes, 1991; Fingerhut & Kleinman, 1988) . . ."" -- James Zimmerman, ""Treating Suicidal Adolescents: Is It Really Worth It?"" in Treatment Approaches with Suicidal Adolescents (1995).<p>As in all such matters, if any participant here can point to current officially gathered statistics by an internationally comparable methodology (for suicide, that is the WHO statistics) with age stratification and a time series for each country, I would be glad to check the details.",1324831674

3391192,comment,3388893,3390006,5,0,wpietri,,,"Hmmm. I think I still maintain my preference for bad Java over bad Ruby. The AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBeanImpl insanity is painful, but I feel like most Java problems can be solved with pruning shears. Ruby's metaprogramming, on the other hand, puts COMEFROM-style functionality into the hands of noobs, and its duck typing makes it very hard to answer basic questions about what the hell X is. In Java, I can always tug on something and figure out what it's connected to. But perhaps that's just a matter of my personal debugging style.<p>Broadly, though, I think you're right: it's irrelevant to the real problem. Java is the new COBOL because most large software development organizations are functionally insane. They can't tell good code from bad, and rig things in a way that bad code is almost guaranteed anyhow. So naturally they'd prefer a language in which bad code is merely painful, not fatal. Because that lets them cover up their failings for much longer periods.<p>My personal solution is yours: stop working with other people's shitty code. I'd like to see the problem solved across the industry, but focusing on language choice doesn't seem like it's getting us anywhere.",1324831282

I know someone (maybe multiple people) who works at a large financial institution. A particular department there is running on ancient systems using ancient processes, most of which can and should be properly outsourced to $BIGVENDOR. The fed agrees, and is constantly hitting them with MRIA's (Matters Requiring Immediate Attention).<p>But right now there are many managers of 50-100 employees who will become redundant when 49 of their employees are replaced by a few servers in NJ. These people tend to passive aggressively slow down the replacement, hoping to delay it until they retire. There are other people who have stable jobs, based not so much on competence as the fact that they hold lots of institutional memory. They don't want to help build a system that will make their knowledge obsolete.<p>When management fires these people, it doesn't do so because it doesn't understand their value. It does so because they are actively hindering the company from moving forward.<p>Sometimes this process fails as you describe. But when properly managed, this process results in a streamlined department half the size it was before, processes properly documented, everything automated, where people are fighting to improve efficiency from 99.7% to 99.9%.",1324828987

Apple software is absolutely full of inflexible, careless and/or poorly conceived anti-features.<p>Not to worry though, it only took them 20 years to decide that multiple-button mice, omni-sided window sizing and full-screen apps were at all useful. I'm sure that the removal of .DS_Store will be celebrated as a great new feature of Pious Puma in a decade or so.",1324828853

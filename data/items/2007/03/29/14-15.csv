7283,comment,7182,7182,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The problem with motivation for an undergrad is when you realize that everything doesn't need to be the way it is now.  Let me clarify.  Most of us have been raised our whole lives with the mantra, ""You have to go to college to succeed.""  I know that my parents didn't go to college, and they were always saying, ""You don't want to end up where I am, working in a factory,"" etc.<p>The problem with that model, however, is that a standard undergraduate education is beginning to become old-fashioned and irrelevant.  How many stories do you hear about students going to four years of school only to graduate and be unable to find employment?  While the problem is not nearly as bad in engineering as in other fields, it's still the case that more and more people are going to college, and as a result, a degree doesn't look nearly as great as it did 20 or 30 years ago.<p>I personally have started to become disenfranchised with the college model in the US.  As an undergrad, I have visited some undergraduate committee meetings and talked personally with a few professors, and the bureaucracy of the whole thing is somewhat disgusting.  Even if a professor wants to make a change to the curriculum (for the better), he or she must endure countless meetings and votes, even for something that is clearly a good idea.  It may take a year or more just to make a minor structural change in a few core courses.<p>Moreover, department heads are not much worried about the success (or lack thereof) of undergrads.  For whatever reason, national groups that rank colleges look mainly at entrance criteria, so as long as the college can successfully lock out those students with low ACT scores (which are largely irrelevant), they look good on paper.  Meanwhile, they hire new professors based <i>only</i> on their research and some interviews, without much regard for teaching backgrounds.<p>In the end, once you go off and create your own startup and work on your own projects, you start to see that college is largely not helpful to an undergrad.  The stuff that is stretched out over four years could probably be learned quite easily by most in two or less, if it was all restructured a bit.  College, in effect, is just another corporation, one that is in the business of paying professors and researching new ideas.  It just happens that most professors do not produce enough ideas quickly enough to justify their income, so undergraduate students make up for that by paying tuition.<p>Once you realize that you can be successful without completing (or even starting) your undergrad, the dedication, motivation, and finances necessary to complete college just don't look like such a good trade anymore.  Most courses follow a textbook, anyways, so just buy the textbook, study it yourself, talk to people online, and you will probably do just as well.  The only downside is that you'll be missing that shiny piece of paper.",1175180029

7280,comment,7253,7253,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The reason to start a startup when you're young and single is because you have no commitments.  Once you have kids, you can't afford to take that kind of chance with your life because you're also responsible for their lives.  But a spouse/significant other who's genuinely supportive is like a partner in the company who's sharing your equity -- if you make it big, he or she makes it big too.<p>On the other hand, a spouse or significant other who's <i>not</i> supportive -- or who means to be supportive but who doesn't actually offer much support, which is worse -- can put enough of a drag on things to make the company fail.  <p>And as brlewis notes, a lot depends on the pace you're trying to run the company at.  If you're using the traditional VC-funded web startup model and working 100-hour weeks in the hacking zone, your relationship with your spouse/SO is going to suffer.  If you're using the consulting/micro-ISV model and expanding the business gradually, it's likely to put a lot less strain on the relationship. ",1175179768

7272,comment,6926,6926,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Engineering can be a lifelong profession, but the longer you spend trying to be a good engineer the more likely you are to work for someone who just Doesn't Get It.  Once a company gets to be a certain size, especially if the people in charge aren't technically skilled, politics and perception trumps physical laws; an engineer who can't make the case for a solution on technical grounds (this is the cleanest way to solve the problem) or on business grounds (this is the cheapest way to solve the problem, and we save $200K a year by doing it this way over the way we originally thought of) but on political grounds (this is neither clean nor cheap, but it uses this buzzword-compliant tech and will increase your budget by $1.5M and require 2 people to support) is not likely to be a happy engineer.",1175178912

But it is really hard to judge them.<p>The really good tests would create a situation where any high value bloke that applies would have girls chasing him on his application stage, before he's even in. That would have good sides and bad; in the long run, it would obsolete the site. If you can find such a test, though, you can make a lot of money out of  site like this.<p>There still is a lot to say about communities that pick their members. Email me if you want to continue the discussion, I have one good idea that I'd happily share.<p>A ""dating site for geeks"", though, should be done completely differently. No competition, no pressure. No meat market. Just a nice, calm place to meet people, talk about actual subjects (""star wars is hot"", not ""you're s0 hut1!""). Modeled after geek conventions and get-togethers (D&D, hacking weekend, ... Geeks use the same recipe for all). It would even succeed. I'm pretty sure something exists, though.<p>Aur Saraf",1175178074

It seems like something totally irrelevant to relationship success, IMHO, especially at a stage where the parties don't know each other at all.<p>To tell the truth, I just don't like services based on limiting the user. I think that requiring the other user to accept a connection (like most IM services, LinkedIn) is good enough at filtering connections without forcing it on the users.<p>Are you a founder/involved person? You sound so. If you are, cool. Regardless, can I get an invite so that I understand better what this is about?",1175177191

Even though F'ton is a university town, and known as one of the more tech-centered places in NB, it is still seriously tough to find like minded individuals.<p>Consider that similar interests are just the first step in a successful collaboration. Finding someone you work well with, who also likes using the same technology, is difficult enough as is, especially in a small town.<p>I think it's a great idea to have a startup weekend.  You probably don't need funding for an event; a meetup at an apartment or even a library meeting room would be cheap enough.  Sites like <a href=""http://meetup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meetup.com/</a> can make the planning easier.  A good place to look would be your local universities and colleges.<p>That being said, I scratched my itch by moving to Vancouver. I couldn't be happier.  There is much of the wilderness here that you enjoy, and it's not uncommon to walk past a bar while overhearing whispers of yet another start up idea.<p>Good luck!",1250506091

767795,comment,766796,767745,0,0,pudo,,,"There certainly are a lot of areas in which the model you propose has been and will continue to be extremely successful: providing a specific group of people - preferably domain experts of some sort - with the knowledge they need remains a business model. In a way, this is also what the 'hyperlocal' people are trying to do; everyone is an expert on their immediate neighborhood and thus information about that should have a great value to them.<p>But there's another side to news: it's also the glue for society and this part depends on not being targeted at any specific group but at the ""mass"" as a whole. That's the part mainstream news has been trying to serve. But now that eyeballs are only worth something if you know who they belong to, this model is collapsing. In my previous post, I wasn't trying to argue that what these organisations are doing is sustainable, but thus far it seems to be the only pattern we have to commercially serving the whole of society. This mechanism failing is the real problem, because it's a central part of our democracy and culture.<p>Also, the quality criteria in this area are only tangentially related to factors like ""truth"" and ""depth of reporting"". A lot of the emphasis, instead, is focussed on aspects of commonality and actuality. Yet, when people argue that ""good reporting"" is what we need, this is often not what they mean.",1250505757

767793,comment,766796,767043,0,0,mseebach,,,"There are decisions and priorities in all reporting.<p>First, often there's no canonical truth. Was the Honduras ""coup"" a coup or a functional democracy? It's pretty hard to report on it without deciding. The more detail you include, the more you'll come out in favour of the democratic argument, the less, the more you make it sound like a coup (there's no point of including all the details of the parliament deliberating if the essence is that the military took over in a coup).<p>Second, there's deciding what news to report. There was some criticism of the media focusing much more on set-backs of US forces in Iraq, and only casually reporting progress - the media loosing interest in Iraq. How do you decide what to report from Iraq without letting your own opinion of the war influence you? I can't see how.<p>I also can't see how you can reliably report on complex political issues without having a deep passion for these issues - and I believe that no one can be deeply impassioned about e.g. the Iraq war without forming an opinion that will be at odds with at least some.<p>The solution: Quit pretending. Have an opinion. Care about what you write about, and let it show. Stop competing on ""most fair"" and ""least biased"", but on ""best arguments"".",1250505675

767787,comment,767776,767776,0,0,ErrantX,,,"I can see why they chose Facebook as a brand because that is the kind of site you associate with building relationships and making much more personal connections.<p>So when they say the ""Facebook of sex"" the idea is to infer a personal connection to excite punters. Sites like Suicide Girls rely heavily on the same tactics - though in a more traditional (some would argue more ethical) way :) I know blokes tend to claim they just ""follow their dicks"" or whatever but it's been well known in the porn industry that a more personal approach (one reason POV videos are so popular) gets more punters.<p>I think Facebook of Sex is a scam or rip off site though (or has something dodgy about it). Not checked it out but all the ads feature fairly well known images from other sites / collections (some of them actually borderline indecent imagery).

767778,comment,767559,767672,0,0,mattwdelong,,,"Though you say it's easy enough to pack up and move, there are numerous issues that come to mind. First, being in University for a few years and then living on the opposite side of North America for the purpose of playing rugby has not give me enough time to pad my resume - I know I can pretty much do anything I want, but I would have a difficult time actually proving that to someone with concrete evidence to back it up.<p>Faced with the problem of finding a job with my weak resume, so that I can support myself in a new area on my own, leads me to believe it is much easier said than done.<p>However, you may be right in saying that by staying here I am limiting myself to something I CAN do opposed to what I want to do. But what I am asking, or even suggesting, is it not possible to stay here AND do what I want? There happens to be tons of industry in the area as far as farming, forestry and trucking go, there is just no apparent 'tech-sector' in my area. It's not that I am entirely opposed to moving, it's just that it would take one awesome opportunity to force me to move, something I couldn't turn down. [offers accepted.]<p>So to better revise my question; I am more or less asking how I can find people like me who already exist in my area, without relocating.",1250505050
767777,comment,765387,765968,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"<i>A legitimately elected government providing services that its citizens may choose to use or not use is not communism. It's also not nazism or the boogeyman.</i><p>You seem to have a strange definition of communism, as well as the history of nazism. Rather, you seem to be buying into the American propaganda that ""democracy is the great good"".<p>A pure implementation of communism is necessarily democratic. Think about it. If all goods, and all production, are controlled by the body of people, then everything must be done by consensus.<p>And you'll recall that in Germany, Hitler was democratically elected to power, and later assumed complete control again by election.<p><i>You understand the the US is atypical in the way that it treats health care?</i><p>You're just using the eight-year-old's ""but johnny gets to stay up late"" technique. And the answer is the same: just because one party does something really has not connection to whether it's the right thing for a different party to do.<p>Anyway, the problem here politically is that the treatment of disease will immediately become politicized. In fact, it is already. People with mundane diseases will plod along, without any real progress made in cures.<p>But diseases having real political constituencies -- AIDS/HIV is the big example -- will get enormous research, despite the fact that they account for a relatively small portion of the populace. Today, AIDS gets many <i>times</i> more funding per-sufferer than does, e.g., breast cancer.<p>Today the government is the largest single funder of healthcare. But once they crowd out other actors, the entire medical profession will be political. That means that treatments will be put onto the approved list, and research dollars will be allocated, as a way of pandering for votes.<p>This isn't an abstract fear: the government does this <i>immediately</i> upon getting involved. For example, look at the recent GM takeover. Despite Obama's claims (continuing to this day) that they don't want to micro-manage GM, Congress <i>immediately</i> set out preventing measures to make GM financially viable, such as closing dealerships. Local car dealerships are a surprisingly powerful constituency, and they get the bureaucrats working in their own interests in no time.",1250505029

The 'web platform' is difficult to write for because there are many different browsers and operating systems.<p>2. The programming language environment for the web is immature and has sharp tools.<p>3. The people who write web apps are poor quality.<p>#1 is true enough. It is painful.  That why we write tests, use automated systems and are driving for standards.  Of course, he could help by persuading Microsoft to play nice with others on web standards.<p>Also, he's forgotten the days of programming in assembly language where you had to pick the processor and BIOS you were targetting.  That was really ugly, but that's where companies like Microsoft got started.<p>#2 is also true enough.  It is an immature environment.  But that will change.<p>#3 is totally true.  There are poor engineers working on the web, but that doesn't mean that there will always be poor engineers on it.  It's a virtuous circle.  The better things get the more the good people will move to it.<p>It strikes me that he's in real danger of missing an 'innovator's dilemma' situation.  Yes, programming for the web is 'crappy' compared to picking a single operating system with very mature advanced tools.  That could be the equivalent of the non-hydraulic backhoes and massive hard disks detailed in the Innovator's Dilemma.  Perhaps he just hasn't seen the change that's coming, coming.",1250504534

I'm sure most people would agree.<p>However this is not what happened. He faced up to 35 years in prison,  he faced being financially ruined by the case and he faced the option to unwillingly 'force' the people who love him (friends and family) to also face financial issues to help him fight this case.<p>This would cause problem in any reasonable person.<p>Why are you both you and the parent suggesting that it is crazy to kill yourself ? It is not crazy. Suicide sometimes is the best way out.<p>I would rather face death than 35 years in prison.\n I also understand why someone wouldn't plaid guilty when they are not guilty, in particular if that still means I have to do up to 6 months in jail.<p>I heard many times people saying I rather die free than live as a prisoner.",1358337559

Sounds more like an issue with the app than the platform. You can develop unstable code anywhere. The remark about Android being ""less intuitive"" is also a classic among Apple fans, but I don't really understand why people keep saying this. It's just not true anymore.",1358337522

With only a few iOS devices, you can test them all with your encoded media (in fact most media encoders have presets for iOS devices) and offer encodings that support all devices.<p>This simply isn't possible with Android. Either you lower the quality (because your video must all be H.264 Baseline 3 for compatibility) or you'll simply get pockets of oddball devices that can't play media (because they don't support the entire set of Main or High profile video features).<p>Additionally, the magazine is probably using HTTP Live Streaming to handle media (the ideal protocol for streaming to iOS devices). While Android technically supports this in Android 3 and 4, there are differences in supported features. Specifically, most of the features in version 3 of HTTP Live Streaming (which came out in iOS 5) -- including multiple audio tracks, closed captions, frame based indexes and more -- are not supported in Android.",1358337436

5066332,comment,5030803,5061930,1,0,dragandj,,,"OK, I'll try to be more precise this time, so I hope that you reconsider at least a few things:<p>First, I think that the main misunderstanding is, as you mentioned, your somewhat incomplete experience of Clojure.<p>Second, perhaps there is a tiny bit of a strawman fallacy in your argument. Why? Well, def is not for defining ""variables"". It does get mentioned many times in Clojure literature: these are vars, you can change them, but they are NOT there for the regular data, but to enable you to give names to your functions and the rest of clojure artefacts. The programmer does not need to use metaprogramming or macros to shoot himself in the foot using vars as ""variables"". How does that relate to the wikipedia definition of referential transparency? Well, only PURE functions are referentially transparent. Def is not pure, and it is not even a function - it is a special form. Of course, it could be confusing for a novice, but it has been clearly stated many times in the literature how and why, so to anyone ho has learned the basics well and is not trying to recreate Java/python/Ruby/C coding style in Clojure, that should not be a source of problems.<p>As for your macro example, the first part of your argument, ""First, I'll show that the argument that it takes must be the code itself, rather than the result of evaluating the code"" - that is something macros are for, so the programmer expects exactly what you described, although you did not need a macro for swapping arguments in a function call.<p>I hope that we agree that, if we know that there are two phases in Cloure compilation process, a ""macro"" phase and a ""regular code"" phase, then everything is fine and clear. I understand that your complaint is that the programmer might forget that so she might be confused in the examples that you stated, so I will continue with that assumption in mind.<p>Let's try referential transparency with the function foo:<p>1) Is the function foo referentially transparent?<p>user=> (defn foo [a b] (swapargs (mod a b)))\n#'user/foo<p>user=> (foo 7 5)<p>5<p>user=> (foo 10 8)<p>8<p>user=> (foo 10 8)<p>8<p>user=> (foo 10 8)<p>8<p>user=> (foo 7 5)<p>5<p>As we can see, ""the same function (foo) with the same arguments will always produce the same result, and that you can call it more (throwing away the result) or fewer (replacing calls with the result) times without affecting the meaning of the program"".<p>2) Is swapargs macro referentially transparent?<p>user=> (swapargs (mod 7 5))<p>5<p>user=> (swapargs (mod 7 5))<p>5<p>user=> (swapargs (mod 7 5))<p>5<p>user=> (swapargs (mod 10 8))<p>8<p>user=> (swapargs (mod 10 8))<p>8<p>Is ""the same function (swapargs) with the same arguments will always produce the same result, and that you can call it more (throwing away the result) or fewer (replacing calls with the result) times without affecting the meaning of the program""?\nWell, is swapargs a function? -No, but let's forget that for a sake of being fair. The proper way to resolve this is to read the documentation of swapargs. And the documentation would say that the argument to swapargs is a clojure form (something like (mod 7 5)), not a number (something like the result of calling (mod 7 5)). If we having that in mind, it is clear that swapargs is also referentially transparent, with regards to its argumens. We CAN replace swapargs with its result, s you can see in the aforementioned code. If we want our argument so be the results of (mod 7 5) we would use a function, not a macro!<p>With the rest of your post, I agree. Macros are not superpowerful, you can shoot yourself in the foot with them (and every lisp book warns you about that in many ways), and haskell is awasome in many ways.\nThere could be many pitfals with clojure and macros, but I think these pitfalls are not of the kind that your examples show :)",1358335438

From what I understand SCTP can be TCP and is more reliable but cannot be proxied via a TURN server since it&#x27;s UDP only. I am experimenting with WebRTC and I built a fallback over websockets but I find myself encrypting the data client side to avoid trust issues because I don&#x27;t have access to the encryption mechanisms baked into WebRTC. I think there needs to be a pluggable fallback mechanism when all the ICE servers are exhausted.",1396198730

To give people an incentive to invent new things:<p>No, the point of the patent system is not to incentivise invention. The point of patents is <i>to destroy trade secrets</i>. The word &quot;patent&quot; means &quot;open&quot;. The whole point of patents is increase society&#x27;s knowledge of how to do things.<p>People invent with or without patents. What they don&#x27;t always do without patents is to say how those inventions work. The bargain inventors make with patents is, tell us how you did it, and in exchange we promise to not compete with you for a while.<p>This is an awesome patent:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US5255452"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US5255452</a><p>This is what patents are supposed to be about: a magician revealing his tricks.

I don&#x27;t think we can fix that.<p>Lets leave aside economic implications for a moment. What is an invention? Is it really different to a discovery. There is no good way to distinguish between invention and discovery because they&#x27;re not distinct concepts. Distinctions are semantic, even in an archetypical example of patentable invention like Edison&#x27;s lightbulb.

7496813,comment,7494015,7495841,1,0,twic,,,"> If you&#x27;re pushing messages to a message broker, you can trivially regulate delivery on most of them by checking queue depth and throwing errors or reducing the delivery rate if they grow beyond a certain threshold.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean. Are you talking about regulating messages going from clients to the broker? I was thinking about regulating messages from the broker to the workers. I haven&#x27;t seen a broker which will let you regulate the flow on a per-consumer basis like that.<p>> I much prefer having the app adding itself - having the load balancer control delivery means it needs to probe for liveness, and the config needs to be updated whenever you bring resources up/down. If the endpoint can register itself, then that&#x27;s one less hassle.<p>It&#x27;s one less hassle in the control plane, and one more in the worker. I would prefer to have this stuff in the control plane rather than the worker, since it&#x27;s not something directly concerned with the work being done. Separation of concerns and all that.<p>> With an MQ, it will stop pulling messages if it&#x27;s not functioning. If it&#x27;s functioning enough to keep pulling messages despite failing a health check, your app is broken<p>Yes. Exactly. I would like the system to do something sane in the face of broken workers.<p>> why was it not doing sufficient checks itself to know that it is not working? Why is there not a monitor on the same physical server with the capability to kill the offending process?<p>That&#x27;s quite a bit more work than just taking it out of the pool. And killing the server isn&#x27;t necessarily the right answer - if the instance is locking up because it&#x27;s going a full garbage collection, for instance, the best thing is probably to let it finish and then put it back in the pool.<p>> What is the difference between monitoring for 500 errors and monitoring for errors from an MQ?<p>500 errors are thrown straight into the client&#x27;s face. The client itself can log that something went wrong. The closest analogue with an MQ would be for the broker to log when a consumer rejects a message. Can you configure them to do that? I honestly don&#x27;t know. You&#x27;ll struggle to have the logs tell a story which makes as much sense, though, because the MQ doesn&#x27;t have the context that exists in the sending app.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, i don&#x27;t think message queues are worthless. There are problems for which they are indisputably the right solution. But i think people should be aware of the operational challenges in using them. I have seen a lot of naive enthusiasm for queues which doesn&#x27;t seem to take this into account.",1396198519

They&#x27;re the result of a hundred million dollars of nation state level R&D by teams of PhD researchers and they&#x27;re still impossibly crude approximations of what real-life interaction feels like. The time-to-market on <i>just</i> this kind of device is expected to be 30 years at best. The expected cost in 2013 dollars when that happens is $150k-200k <i>per</i> limb.<p>Things have to be possible on the technology curve we&#x27;re already on and have to respect physics. You can&#x27;t waive your hands and insist that in your fantasy world it should just be possible. They have to be something that can be taken from nascent R&D to market at a cost consumers can actually buy. More importantly they have to be useful, non-fatiguing interfaces that don&#x27;t take up half of somebody&#x27;s living room.

It also doesn&#x27;t provide the necessary optics via <i>physics</i> to provide VR. If what you&#x27;re talking about are two Glass-like displays, positioned like Glass, no matter the resolution or latency, you are no loner talking about VR and we&#x27;re in a different discussion.<p>Here&#x27;s a even did a mockup for you <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/njToujz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/njToujz.jpg</a><p>Glass isn&#x27;t even capable of AR, let alone stereoscopic VR.

Physics is a ruleset we can&#x27;t wave our hands at and get around.<p>> or that real-time 3d face scanning is a potential advancement<p>There&#x27;s only two possible interaction models for the kind of virtual communication, the glass one which is trivial to demonstrate isn&#x27;t a good model and the fully VR model which then requires you to be modeled and your conversation partner to be modeled to you each have something to look at.

7496781,comment,7496231,7496231,11,0,jvilk,,,"> Who Maintains Type Definitions?<p>Hi. As a user of TypeScript in all of my projects, if I find a typing bug or a deficiency in a typing, I commit a fix to DefinitelyTyped. Or if a library isn&#x27;t typed, I create a typing myself and contribute it.<p>> Or, what if there are type definitions, but not for the particular version of the library you need to use?<p>Then you don&#x27;t use type definitions, and you &quot;fall back&quot; to untyped interactions with the library -- just like JavaScript. Or, you write those type definitions yourself, and contribute them to DefinitelyTyped. They are very open to PRs.<p>> How can you be sure the definitions are correct?<p>You usually figure that out through testing, and you either contribute fixes upstream, use casting as a hackfix, or cease to use the typing. They are never going to be perfect, but they are a <i>hell of a lot better than nothing</i>.<p>And all definitions are required to have valid code associated with them that compiles properly. Usually this is grabbed from documentation, if available. Thus, it&#x27;s likely that if a typing is broken, it&#x27;s in a small subtle way that won&#x27;t be encountered in common use-cases.<p>> If you love JavaScript, warts and all, but wish it had classes, modules, interfaces and static typing then TypeScript is the answer.<p>I <i>hate</i> JavaScript. But it&#x27;s all we have to work with in the browser environment, and there are many wonderful libraries available that I like to use in my projects. So, I program in it.<p>TypeScript makes it much easier to write large projects with multiple contributors, and it makes it much easier for new contributors to have confidence in their changes, as a whole class of JavaScript runtime errors are automatically found by the compiler through type inference/type checking. And the Visual Studio tooling is just dandy, with up-and-coming support in Eclipse and WebStorm/IntelliJ.<p>TypeScript is the answer for me.",1396198263

If you make a huge profit on each vehicle and you can cover your fixed/development costs then you&#x27;re golden, regardless of volume. At low volume that typically means higher profit margins, but that&#x27;s nothing new. Companies like Maserati, Aston Martin, and Lambourghini have sales volumes in the 1-2k per year range. Companies like Bugatti are lucky if they break 100 car sales a year.<p>Obviously Tesla isn&#x27;t quite in the same market as those companies but that still demonstrates the point.<p>If you have a sub-$100k car then you generally do want higher sales volume in a fleet. If you look at, for example, Audi they have a mix of cars at a variety of price-points, which enables them to amortize development costs of shared components. That effectively raises the profit margin on their luxury margins (since the development of stuff like the frame, most of the engine, etc. is payed for by sales of the down market models).",1396198187

Identical algorithms can be implemented in very different ways within and across programming languages, so there is no comparative value.

The former is &quot;obvious&quot; but all good implementations use the latter code design because it is much more scalable in real systems even though the algorithms are equivalent.<p>Most algorithm patents with code go for &quot;matches the high-level description of the algorithm&quot; rather than &quot;is an optimal representation of the algorithm given current computer science&quot;.

People can be well-rested and still have terrible ideas. It might go the other way. It could be that, because these ideas are so terrible, people throw insane amounts of effort behind them to avoid being blamed when they fail. When you have a death march (and most VC darlings are whole-company death marches) you&#x27;re going to see a split between those who disengage and drop out, and the &quot;A for Effort&quot; strategists who believe that 110-hour work weeks will be noticed above and have them &quot;rescued&quot; (promotion in a big company, EIR gig in VC) when their current project fails. Generally, founders are going to take the &quot;A for Effort&quot; strategy so that, if they fail, they can launch their careers in VC. Employees generally don&#x27;t have those exit options, but they can&#x27;t exactly leave before their bosses do in most of these companies.<p>What we have is an economy of asymmetric risk. Just as hedge fund managers share profits but not losses, and therefore have a higher-risk tolerance than the principals, the decision makers in the VC-funded world benefit disproportionately from obscene risk. Being able to say that one was in Facebook early is career-making for a VC, while 0x and 5x are essentially identical in the personal career calculus.<p>Founders share some of the risk (they suffer if the thing fails) but at least take part in the upside. Employees get mainly the downside: mediocre equity and no control, nonexistent career support, high risk of job loss and painful hours.<p>This leads to a risk fetishism (young people! fail fast! sleep is for the weak!) that doesn&#x27;t make for a good place to work, nor does it produce broad-based success (VC is an underperforming asset class). It produces terrible ideas, reckless business expansion, <i>and</i> the extreme long hours of the startup ecosystem.<p>TL;DR: the sleep deprivation is a symptom of a deeper problem (risk fetishism arising out of the principal-agent problem in VC).",1396197599

Within academic bioscience, I think there is great consensus on what Big Data is - I have not seen much argument at all; however, it is still very hard to define within that field.  The best I can do, over this cup of coffee, is to state that there is a clear distinction between the study of a gene, up to a few pathways vs. computational analysis of multiple OMICS (genomics, metabolomics and proteomics) datasets.  I know that definition is terribly lacking and I am fighting the urge to delete it for the sake of getting the post completed.  Anyway, Big Data is clearly changing the academic biosciences through the funding trend.  That is, grants with a computational focus, or sub focus, certainly seem to be doing comparably well.  I mention this because todays academic funding trends influence the direction of tomorrows startups as those being trained are disproportionally within the better funded labs, and draw upon their previous experience when forming companies.  So, I personally believe this Big Data thing, however it is best defined over all, or within a given field, is in some way something new, and will continue to shape the startup sphere for years to come, especially in the areas of genomics, metabolomics and proteomics.

I&#x27;m not claiming that Strangecoin represents the &quot;true value&quot; of our transactions; I&#x27;m simply saying that it&#x27;s another way to model our economic relations, and looking at the network in this way might reveal salient aspects of the network that are hidden from view with other currencies. So I think Strangecoin really is describing some aspect of our economic relations, and it&#x27;s a perspective that money often doesn&#x27;t give you. If you trade me money, I don&#x27;t know where it came from or what ties it has to the rest of the economy. But if you trade me Strangecoin, the trade itself gives me a picture of your importance and influence on the rest of the economy, and I can use that information to judge the value of the trade we&#x27;re engaged in.<p>The low transaction cost of money is partly a result of how deeply embedded it is in our social and institutional practices. I don&#x27;t think it is an essential feature of money itself; other practices might come to fill similar roles. I would also suggest that the opacity of traditional currencies to certain forms of value also has a crippling effect on our economy. Economics talks about these as &quot;externalities&quot;, but they are best understood as values that aren&#x27;t represented in our trades.

The problem with fructose is that the liver has only a limited ability to properly process it. This if you get too much the liver processes a lot of it through the wrong pathways, and that causes all types of chaos.<p>There are a couple of differences with natural fructose. First natural fructose almost always comes with fiber. The fiber if processed at the same time as the fructose allows the liver to properly process more fructose. This is because the fiber provides certain nutrients which allow the liver to process more fructose along the proper pathways.<p>Second, natural fructose is usually in plant cells. In order for us to process these, we much first break down the plant cells in our stomach. This takes some time, so the effect is that the natural fructose does not hit the liver in the same speed and concentration as refined fructose.<p>This all has scientific support by the way. Lustig mentioned a study in old Caribbean sugar plantations. There they tracked the health of the masters and workers. It turned out that while both the masters and workers ate mostly sugar, the masters had a lot of health problems associated with obesity and diabetes, while the workers did not.

With a lot of vitamins the argument is over absorbability of different forms, e.g. there are various forms of dietary calcium, and various kinds of calcium supplements, and they may not be equivalent. But my understanding was that fructose in fruit is pretty much just fructose, readily absorbable just like the isolated version is. The only plausible difference I can come up is concentration; there&#x27;s a limit on how much fructose you can get from fruits because the average person is not going to scarf down a half-dozen pears in a sitting.

I find it barking mad that you can get a 4 year degree without using C or close equivalent. How else you do <i>really</i> understand how the machine works, how do you debug difficult hardware problems, how do you.. you get the idea.<p>The counter argument is that University is not trade school. Sure, but you need to understand the fundamentals. While I intensely dislike how Knuth uses a made up assembly language for his books, he has an important point - we really do need to understand how things are implemented under the hood, either because we are the ones implementing what is under the hood, or we have to understand which of many choices to use, and/or to debug problems when they come up. And that is not a detail, it is a fundamental aspect of being an engineer.<p>I witness people, when I ask them &quot;why is X happening&quot;, respond with guesses. I don&#x27;t mean they say &quot;since Y and Y, I suspect Q&quot;, which is a reasonable utterance for an engineer. I just get &quot;Q&quot;. You press as to why, and like startled birds they flush and you get &quot;well, maybe R, or it could be P. Yes, it&#x27;s P&quot;.<p>Whether it is a &quot;science&quot; degree or &quot;engineering&quot;, we need to understand systems, and have experience with them. Reading a book about heaps only takes you so far. If you haven&#x27;t implemented, say, a simple file allocation system, debugged some pointers, stepped through the allocation and deallocation of memory, looked at the assembly generated from your code, and so on (these can reasonably be replaced with other, equivalent experiences of course), how can you really understand computers?",1396195682

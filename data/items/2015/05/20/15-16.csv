I understand the implications that financial assets can be tagged to colored coins and that those coins can be traded without the need for a third party.

Changes to theglobal resource are visible to other processes that are members ofthe namespace, but are invisible to other processes.  One use ofnamespaces is to implement containers.<p>Virtualization via hypervisor does a lot more than just namespace isolation.[1]<p>> The basic idea behind a hypervisor based virtualization is to emulate the underlying physical hardware and create virtual hardware(with your desired resources like processor and memory). And on top of these newly created virtual hardware an operating system is installed. So this type of virtualization is basically operating system agnostic. In other words, you can have a hypervisor running on a windows system create a virtual hardware and can have Linux installed on that virtual hardware, and vice versa.<p>> So the main basic thing to understand about hypervisor based virtualization is that, everything is done based on a hardware level. Which means if the base operating system (the operating system on the physical server, which has hypervisor running), has to modify anything in the guest operating system(which is running on the virtual hardware created by the hypervisor), it can only modify the hardware resources, and nothing else.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slashroot.in/difference-between-hypervisor-virtualization-and-container-virtualization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slashroot.in/difference-between-hypervisor-virtua...</a>",1432137235

Coughlin couldn’t do much about all the shooters in Southeast who got away with it. But he could enforce drug laws, gang injunctions, and parole and probation terms relatively easily just by driving around and making “good obs”— good observations, cop lingo for catching, at a glance, a bulge under a shirt, a furtive motion of hands. A chase might ensue, and sometimes ended with the cops shutting down whole neighborhoods as the LAPD “airship,” or helicopter, thumped overhead. Coughlin took extra risks to get guns— this was the gold standard.<p>Coughlin’s methods were guaranteed to look like straight harassment to those on the receiving end. After all, how important was a bag of marijuana in a place where so many people were dying? But Coughlin’s motivation wasn’t to juke stats, boost his department “rating,” or antagonize the neighborhood’s young men. He had seen the Monster, and his conscience demanded that he do something. So he used what discretion he had to compensate for the state’s lack of vigor in response to murder and assault.<p>This practice of using “proxy crimes” to substitute for more difficult and expensive investigations was widespread in American law enforcement. The legal scholar William J. Stuntz singled it out as a particularly damaging trend of recent decades. In California, proxy justice had transformed enforcement of parole and probation into a kind of shadow legal system, sparing the state the trouble of expensive prosecutions. State prisons, already saddled with sick and elderly inmates, were all the more crammed as a result.<p>But in the squad rooms of Southeast station, cops insisted that desperate measures were called for. They would hear the name of a shooter, only to find they couldn’t “put a case” on him because no witnesses would testify. So they would write a narcotics warrant— or catch him dirty. “We can put them in jail for drugs a lot easier than on an assault. No one is going to give us information on an assault,” explained Lou Leiker, who ran the detective table in Southeast in the early aughts. To them, proxy justice represented a principled stand against violence. It was like a personalized imposition of martial law.<p>Leovy, Jill (2015-01-27).

This actually perpetuate the unspoken racism, where people consciously or unconsciously associate black people with all the bad things happening in ghetto.<p>As a counter example, Asian Americans were also highly discriminated against in the past century, immigration from Asia were barred, those who were here cannot acquire citizenship, cannot own land, etc etc. Asians were generally viewed as poor uneducated labours, not too different from blacks. But today Asians are hardly viewed as that, largely thanks to large influx of educated and hard working Asian immigrants in recent years (due to immigration law preference), who changed the public perception of Asians, lifted Asian neighbourhoods from ghetto status and gave positive role model and connections to poor Asian kids (local or immigrants).<p>Conclusion?

Police are actually much more tolerant of open-air/street corner drug-dealing in black ghetto neighborhoods than in suburbia. If you read books or news articles about these neighborhoods, you see that the dealing gets ignored for months and months, or the dealers are harassed and arrested and then right back out on the street later in the day. This would never be tolerated the same way in suburbia. Then what happens is that there is a shooting, or a gang war with many shootings breaks out. Neighbors demand that the police &quot;do something.&quot; Since the police do not know who is responsible and witnesses refuse to talk, the police take the path of least resistance and lock up whoever they can on drug charges. I recommend the books &quot;Ghettoside&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot; for more on these issues.<p><i>Do you know what Ockham&#x27;s razor is?</i><p>The elephant in the room is that black ghetto communities do not self-police and have a dire problem of particular senseless and indiscriminate murders. For instance, <i>Ghettoside</i> recounted a story of a 13-year-old, black kid wandering through the back alleys of his neighborhood, stumbling across a gang of older youths, who immediately started shooting at him. That is just insane. Completely insane. And the book is full of examples like that, of street shootings that take out innocent bystanders because the shooter couldn&#x27;t be bothered to verify that the target was actually in an enemy gang.<p>If a community does not self-police, then there are two equally bad options: 1) outsiders can impose their own policing, which is always going to be fraught, brutal, and mistake-prone. 2) other communities can just try to contain the problem, ie, they can segregate themselves.",1432136648

This wasn&#x27;t without any debt but I went to a state university that cost about $10k/yr and paid for most of it by working part time throughout school and full time over summers (while living for free at home during breaks, foregoing the car payment, and skipping the pricey spring breaks and summer vacations).<p>That&#x27;s not to say I didn&#x27;t take out any loans but when I graduated, I owed the equivalent of a Ford Focus rather than a good chunk of a home mortgage.  Looking at the costs at the same state university, it&#x27;s now up to around $13k for tuition, fees, and a dorm room for a full year.  That&#x27;s a decent $3k/yr bump from what I paid but I also didn&#x27;t take advantage of cheap community college tuition for the first year or two so there are still ways to do it and not graduate with $50-100k in debt.<p>If anything, I think what&#x27;s missing (and was missing for me as well) is a real focus on the value of degrees and the real cost of debt.  Offers of loans and credit are thrown at students all the time and it&#x27;s way too easy to accept when you haven&#x27;t spent years of being truly broke and in debt.  Likewise, there was so much focus on just going to college because that is what you did after high school.  Just pick a major based on something you like and no mention is made of which fields are actually hiring and what they&#x27;re paying.<p>The idea of just going to college and paying $40k or $60k to spend four years learning about something interesting just &quot;because&quot; really only works if you come from wealth and can just pay for it.  As long as it costs that much, I think there should really be more focus on exactly what you&#x27;re getting at the end.  Too many young people think it&#x27;s &quot;college, then graduate, then get job in field, then use salary to pay off any loans while maybe saving up to buy a house somewhere down the line&quot;.

9576974,comment,9574907,9576790,0,0,this_user,,,"> Anyone with a large amount of Bitcoin mining capacity is implicitly incentivised to not mount an attack on the integrity of the Blockchain because doing so would probably dent confidence in Bitcoin, causing the price to drop. That would reduce the &quot;net present value&quot; that the miner can expect to receive going forward, likely by more than the short-term &quot;win&quot; they could achieve through a successful attack.<p>That&#x27;s the argument Bitcoin advocates always use, but it oversimplifies the problem. The assumption is that no one would do this, because it is not in their <i>long-term</i> best interest. What it leaves out that mounting one attack of a series of attacks in quick succession may actually make it worth the costs in the short-term. This is especially true when we talk about large amounts of real assets. Furthermore, there may be malicious entities that are prepared to pay the costs just for the sake of wreaking havoc. The argument that 51% attacks cannot happen has, in fact, already been disproven since there is evidence that the GHash mining pool did perform such an attack [1]. All it takes for something like this to happen is one rogue employee in an organisation that controls enough hashing power.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=327767.0</a>",1432135943

It operates on the same principle: arbitrarily execute everyone at the bottom of the perceived bell curve.<p>That leads me to a translation of a quote by Stalin: &quot;Those who cast the votes decide nothing; those who count the votes decide everything.&quot;  The counting method has a greater effect upon the outcome than the actual votes.<p>How you measure the worth of someone may have little relation to the value they can actually provide.  If you rank people by how quickly they can move 100m, and subsequently hire Carl Lewis and FloJo to manage Justin Gatlin, Tyson Gay, Mo Greene, Carmelita Jeter, and Tori Bowie, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed when they try to do the same 5m 20 times, or 100m up a vertical rope, or 100m across the surface of a lake, or 100m while carrying a 50 kg backpack, or 100m across ice and snow, or 100m across a tightrope, or 100m on a flat, straight, level track, at local noon, in June, in the Sonora desert, with only 1 L of water.<p>So that Gates quote sounds to me a bit like begging the question, defining an &quot;A person&quot; as &quot;someone Microsoft ranks well&quot;, a &quot;B person&quot; as &quot;someone Microsoft ranks neutrally&quot; and a &quot;C person&quot; as &quot;someone Microsoft ranks poorly&quot;.

It makes them the best people <i>by Microsoft&#x27;s method of estimation</i>.<p>There really are no 10x or 0.1x developers.

You cannot have any other trusted source of information about these bits except from the bits themselves. And there&#x27;s a plenty of reasons for someone to actively try to deceive you (&quot;active attackers&quot; as in &quot;hostile environment&quot;). You have no idea how many people are out there and how much they are connected and who is connected to you. You are just sitting in this blinded box with a radio station.<p>Your goal is to make sure that whatever bits you receive are exactly the same as everyone else is seeing. In other words, that it is practically impossible for an attacker to produce alternative bits satisfying your requirements and show them to someone else (and not showing to you). One way to make it is to make these bits fully predictable (like digits of Pi), but that&#x27;s not useful. Another way is to implement a gigantic ever-growing proof-of-work that implements the condition of &quot;practical impossibility&quot;. You receive some bits with such a big pile of PoW that you can be sure it&#x27;s not possible for someone to quietly build an alternative bunch of bits with the same PoW and unleash it on you or anyone else.<p>Protein folding and proof of stake do not help with this problem. You need abstract ever-growing scarcity implemented by converting energy into a short number.<p>You might ask: why should we be so strict with the security requirement? Well, because history of civilization shows that people always try really hard to build hierarchies of power to manipulate property and human beings.

Jackass driver loves it because he never has to reform his jackass ways.  Your own link details these criticisms:<p>Critics of no-fault argue that dangerous drivers not paying for the damage they cause encourages excessive risky behavior, with only raised premiums and a higher risk rating as the potential consequence, and no jury awards or legal settlements. Detractors of no-fault also point out that legitimate victims with subtle handicaps find it difficult to seek recovery under no-fault. Another criticism is that some no-fault jurisdictions have among the highest automobile-insurance premiums in the country, but this may be more a matter of effect than cause (e.g., the financial savings from no-fault may simply make it more popular in areas with higher automobile-accident risk, or high insurance rates may cause more drivers to go uninsured, increasing the attraction of a no-fault system).",1432134409

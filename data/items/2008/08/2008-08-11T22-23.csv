The business structure just had too big of an impact on the design.  If all the businesses you're trying to serve have a similar business model (e.g. shipping physical stuff, or digital subscriptions, or selling software downloads) then you might get some leverage, but as soon as you throw in anything weird (refunds, credit card holds, recurring billing, staged billing, payment by something other than a credit card, etc. etc. etc.) it can get very, very complicated.

I think that good unit tests test a lot more than type errors and although they are related to design patterns, in that design patterns allow easily unit testable code, and having unit tests in place allows easy refactoring.. unit tests would be helpful even if no standard design patterns were in use.<p>One main barrier to Unit testing that I have personally seen is that a lot of my work is GUI based or simple database CRUD applications.

It took Google 10 years for them to become a HUGE success. During this 10 years they probably have worked really hard everyday, and they're all brilliant people. For less talented people it probably takes even longer.<p>I guess your point is if you're just gonna do a declicious-scale success it doesn't take that long. YouTube even just took a year. But look at how much experience they have under their belt before that. It really depends on where you start counting that 10 years.<p>The article doesn't specify either, though.

273420,comment,273006,273265,0,0,strlen,,,"Hi,<p>I've setup a hadoop cluster for a start-up I am working in. Initial reason? The amount of incoming log data was getting too slow to process on a single machine and having had a single graduate course in distributed systems I knew a) what is required to go from a single script to a system distributed across nodes b) that I am not in the capacity (alone) to create this system in a time window that will meet business needs.<p>As a result, I saw hadoop as offering a solution to: implement a distribute process where by records are processes in parallel by multiple machines without having to worry about implementing locking and message passing; distribute disk seek times across a cluster of nodes, pool together disk space with ability to add disk space by simply adding new commodity machines to a cluster.<p>If you have these specific needs: 
a) need to rapidly and robustly process more data than a single machine can handle (think of it this way -- if you do data processing with a Perl script on a single machine, will the data be simply too old by the time the Perl script is done?) 
b) ability to add storage for new data without powering machines down 
c) the data is non-relational (i.e. you aren't exporting data from MySQL and then re-importing it again - if your data can be stored effectively inside a MySQL cluster and queried in a relational manner, you don't need to use hadoop).<p>Now, if you still think you need hadoop (in most of the cases, answer is ""you don't""):<p>To get hadoop going minimally to be useful right away is actually almost trivial.<p>However, as your dataset grows, the amount of jobs and the size of the cluster grow as well as the expectation of hadoop to also be a reliable data store grow, you will run into plateaus that you'll need to overcome.<p>To answer your questions directly:
- Getting it going is easy, trivial. Do it first on your desktop (if you run Linux directly, if not under VMWare). Process is straight forward.
- Peeking into the source is not required to get it going
- Pitfalls: 
    * Use enough memory, JVM is a memory hog. Always make sure you have sufficient swap (4x your memory)
    * Find the optimal size of input data for your task (if you are using compressed files for input).<p>(Yes, I will write these learnings up eventually).",1218492910

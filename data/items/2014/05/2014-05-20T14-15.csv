As for image quality, the output you get on the SD card doesn&#x27;t match the capability of the sensor- looking at the raw output from the microHDMI port vs the encoded files- there needs to be many more bitrate options. The top end GoPro models have that right. I don&#x27;t always need 1080p, and so most of the time I just use 720, but I really want an SHQ 720p mode that cranks the bitrate- that would be beautiful. I&#x27;ve also used it quite a bit for still frame interval timelapse, and have been similarly disappointed in the grainy over-compressed look of them.<p>verdict: good value, kind of pricey accessories for what you get, just adequate video quality, excellent audio for an action cam, good flexibility (video and timelapse options, HDMI out, mic in, decent waterproof case).",1400597891

7772840,comment,7771524,7772026,4,0,chewxy,,,"I could be wrong (and if so, pie my face), but I believe it&#x27;s mostly due to one of the many the inline cache optimizations that v8 employs.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the receiver (i.e the `this` value)  of Example 1 and 2. The receiver of Example 1 is Benchmark, if invoked normally. The receiver of Example 2 is the empty function object function(){}.<p>When you call makeKeyCodepointObj.makeKey() - the VM looks up the object&#x27;s prototype chain and finds the function. This call site is cached (think of it as a K:V store, where the key is &quot;makeKeyCodepointObj.makeKey&quot; and the value is the call site of the function.)<p>When you call makeKeyCodepoint(), the VM has to, for each call, look up the prototype chain until it finds the variable. The variable is then resolved into the function call site. Because of scoping issues in JS, I don&#x27;t think this is cached (or if it&#x27;s cached, it&#x27;d be invalidated a lot), and a lookup has to happen every time.  (I know in my JS engine, I tried to perform caching optimization for global object properties and I gave up).<p>TL;DR: Function lookups happen all the time when the function is a method of the global object. When a function is a method of an object, the lookup is cached.<p>If I am talking out of my arse, please feel free to correct me.",1400597765

Assuming it is still alive just reaching it would already be quite something, getting some useful readings from it would be absolutely awesome.<p>This may be something where talking to the HAM community will be more productive than talking to the hacker community, the first step would be to reliably track it using an antenna suitable for the frequency range and checking if it is emitting anything at all before attempts to contact it would make much sense (once you have a signal to home in on it is a lot easier to prod it rather than to prod blindly until something responds).<p>Keep in mind that this frequency band is not exactly unlicensed territory, you&#x27;re smack in the mobile aeronautical band according to ofcom.

This is the genesis of the effect where a bog standard boring off the shelf employee, when converted to &quot;contractor&quot; suddenly gets three times as much work done in a mere six hours as an employee required to be butt in seat for twelve hours can accomplish.<p>I think its a nearly universal truth amongst white collar employees that if they only had to be at work while actually working, they&#x27;d probably only be at work about four to six hours per day, but they&#x27;d get at least twice as much work done.  This is obviously a Fortune50 kind of observation more so than a startup.<p>In the pre-internet era it was pointless meetings and teambuilding activities and water cooler talk and especially smoke breaks.  Oh and extended lunch at desk, in addition to the actual lunch hour, plus extended breaks.<p>In the end, if not carried out to extremes, it works out for everyone.  The white collar workers experience something like a grade school playground or perhaps kindergarten classroom experience where most of their time is spent talking about their feelings, and who&#x27;s in or out of such and such club, gossip, and what they saw on TV last night, and the boss gets a promotion because obviously he&#x27;s more effective because he had butts in seats for 12 hours and his management competitors only had butts in seats for 10 hours and that&#x27;s all that matters because that&#x27;s all that can be verifiably documented and measured.

7772572,comment,7757788,7757788,1,0,luxpir,,,"Joining the party late, but haven&#x27;t seen my perspective offered yet...<p>I&#x27;m a little disheartened at the state of IM clients and usage. Since Google&#x27;s dodgy Hangouts and open XMPP slaying I&#x27;ve struggled to find a decent alternative to Gtalk. I liked the old client, the lightweight desktop one. Pidgin was a solid enough replacement, and apparently version 3 due soon ought to bring audio/video. That&#x27;s all well and good, but to reach a minimum level of real privacy it would make sense to leave the Google ecosystem.<p>Well. I opened a Dukgo account last year and had a few contacts added to that, hoping to grow the list over time, but few Gmail contacts (most of my contacts) actually receive or can accept the XMPP invites anymore (those who&#x27;ve moved wholesale over to Hangouts?) and any that are added have the conversations logged at their end anyway. The &#x27;Google owns most people&#x27;s email&#x27; problem applies to chat, too, unfortunately. Add to that the barrier of setting up a new IM client or XMPP account, most folks are just not interested in leaving the convenience of Google-world.<p>At the moment I&#x27;ve got Finch set up on the Raspberry Pi (running on tmux), to be connected to whenever/from wherever. It&#x27;s working quite well, but is obviously short on &#x27;features&#x27;. Nice to not have to disconnect/reconnect constantly though, and pick up messages at my convenience. I do the same with IRSSI to a lesser extent. I&#x27;m not connecting to the Google contact list with it.<p>I did try out Jitsi, but found it to be nearly as much of a resource hog as Skype, a client I&#x27;ve been trying to extricate myself from, but have been forced to re-install for certain clients/contacts. As I mentioned above, the new Pidgin will be interesting.<p>It&#x27;s really hard for me to understand how many people are happy to support Facebook/Skype/Google&#x27;s walled-garden approach in this day and age. Now that the momentum behind the privacy debate is waning, I&#x27;m worried (perhaps annoyed, more accurately) that there&#x27;s even less incentive for people to support an open and private IM client, be it XMPP/OTR or P2P-based.<p>So I&#x27;m left with a tiny contact list, mainly consisting of Google-based contacts anyway and wondering if it&#x27;s time to give up on going private. To accept that people just aren&#x27;t interested, and are happy to cede as much control as popular-company-of-the-day wants to take? The cost of not accepting that fact is a certain level of social cut-off. I do wonder if life is too short to worry myself about things like this. But life does go on after I&#x27;m gone, and I&#x27;d rather the future was open, or at least had open alternatives that people actually wanted to use.<p>Actual answer: Finch on RPi via SSH, back to email/phone for those who couldn&#x27;t be added to the Dukgo contact list.",1400594773

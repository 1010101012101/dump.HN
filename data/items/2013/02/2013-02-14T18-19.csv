The web is moving much faster than the Standards and their inaction has lead to their dwindling importance. The W3C hasn't even ratified HTML5 yet (their hoping to do so in 2014!).<p>Within the time frame of the W3C discussing HTML5 Google started Chrome and has shipped 24 versions. Not only that, but they aren't waiting around for the W3C to vote and have shipped a ton of emerging tech: WebGL, WebRTC, NaCL, Web Speech, Web Intents, etc etc etc.<p>How is this bad?

You can only pump so many fake video promotions into a market before it's completely saturated and people start to resent the constant assault of your ads. Not to mention the fact that every Tom, Dick and Jane with a camera is already pushing their own videos every chance they get.<p>Then there's this:<p>> “All [Jimmy Kimmel] had done was expose [the Double Rainbow] video to a couple hundred million people who would find this video interesting to them,” Debelov says. (Actually, [Kimmel] tweeted it to his 90,000 Twitter followers). “We’ve taken that process, and reversed engineered it. We can’t guarantee your video will go viral because it all depends on your content, but we can get it in front of a million, two million, half a million, whatever your budget is – we can get you in front of that audience.”<p>You've reverse engineered the power of celebrity? Highly doubtful. When a comedian with the clout of Jimmy Kimmel calls something the ""funniest video in the world""[1], his fans are going to watch that video. When those same people see a video advertisement at the bottom of a blog post or in one of their mobile apps, they're going to ignore it. Hell, even celebrity has its limits -- Kimmel's suggestions would be ignored if he started posting random videos rather than specific links of his own choosing.<p>Anyone born after 1980 has been conditioned since adolescence to ignore online advertisements. It's gotten to the point where you have two choices: 1.) Make your ad so obtrusive that it might actually cost you users, or 2.) Don't infuriate your users, and settle for a CTR of .01% on a good day. I can only see this service reinforcing that conditioning.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/17665533038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/jimmykimmel/status/17665533038</a>",1360868081

For example, the city of Chicago sued my town, because there was an obscure provision on our books that allowed a certain tract of land to be Section 8 housing. So the state jacked up our taxes to build cheap apartments and then literally bused people from Caprini Green (A project) to our sleepy little town.

The law was first passed in New York requiring Amazon to collect sales tax from NY customers.  NY claimed Amazon's NY ""associates"", affiliates earning commissions for sending customers to Amazon, represented a physical nexus.  Amazon agreed to collect the tax in this case, but it opted not to collect tax in other states who enacted a similar law.  Instead Amazon effectively ""fired"" all of the affiliates living in those states.  In one case Fat Wallet, a major player in the online affiliate industry, moved their company out of Illinois because they lost many of their affiliate partners.  Illinois didn't gain anything and lost a source of income tax.  This has been a major issue in the affiliate industry as it cuts off huge sources of revenue for affected affiliates.

It must be acknowledged that this complicated check on legislation may in some instances be injurious as well as beneficial; and that the peculiar defense which it involves in favor of the smaller States, would be more rational, if any interests common to them, and distinct from those of the other States, would otherwise be exposed to peculiar danger.""<p><a href=""http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/fed/blfed62.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/fed/blfed62.htm</a>",1360867905

My sister, who goes to school in Weatherford, OK finally decided to switch providers b/c she could not get any service while in Weatherford.  She was relegated to texting instead of calling because of the poor service coverage.  The most important reason she decided to leave of course, was safety.  She left our plan on Jan, 5 2013.  Recently, I noticed I was charged a $200 contract termination fee.  I cannot begin to explain how upset this makes me.  The only reason she left t-mobile was because she couldnt get a signal and we were worried about her safety.<p>When I called in today, a customer service rep told me that I was charged because the third line was included in my contract.  I was absolutely not told about this change when the contract was extended in August.  It was my understanding that the first 2 lines were held to the contract and any add-on lines could move with no penalty.  Ive been a happy customer with T-Mobile for over 10 years until today.  My request is that you waive the $200 fee.  I dont mind paying for the service for the remainder of the month of January but I absolutely do not think its just to charge me the $200 fee, especially when she left the plan b/c of coverage issues.<p>I told the CSR that this was seriously making me consider moving to another carrier.  It is my opinion that if you arent concerned/loyal to the customers that have been with you for such a long time, then as a customer, I should have no qualms in reciprocating that sentiment.<p>Please renew my faith in T-Mobile.",1360867845

OLPC, Ubuntu, Khan Academy, Coursera, solar panels, cell networks - the list goes on.<p>Startup folks and street punks have a lot of similar ideas about what we want, but really different aesthetics. The punks I've known are much more well-read and just as bright as the grad students I spend time with now. On the other hand, they're in denial about capitalism. Both groups have a lot to learn from each other, if only they can look over the other's smarminess/smelliness.",1360867520

There were several use cases that we could not have imagined when we set out on our path.<p>First, there was a case where a high school girl was equipment manager of her school football team.  She was gang raped by some of the players. She was talking about that in chat with her friend, talking about committing suicide, and talking about how she couldn't tell her parents. She was afraid of what they would do to her. To her! Our engine caught much of this, and flagged it for the parents. It worked out in the end. We found out about this after the fact when the parents contacted us to let us know how our software probably saved her life.<p>Then there was the situation where there was a father who was a community fire chief. His child installed the software on his father's computer because his father was abusing him, and was spending time in really really bad chat rooms. The kid was hoping we were monitoring the alerts. The child eventually reached out to us asking why we hadn't sent the police. It was heart breaking.<p>Lastly, there was a kid who was buying drugs from a contact online. Is this a sexual predator? No. But a predator nonetheless. Our software flagged it.<p>There are bad people out there. Some of them are the Chris Hanson predator types. They aren't all sexual predators, but they are still looking to gain access to children without parental permission.<p>Children and young people react with ""this software violates my rights!"" As a child, under the age of 18, in the US, has no rights. A parent is supposed to parent. They have no right to privacy.<p>The software was not meant to record chats. It worked as a sort of a sliding window, and only when there was a flagged issue would a parent get a notification. That notification would include some of the chat around the offending line to give context, but nothing more.<p>With regard to access to kids - parents can look into a living room and ask ""who is that?"" Well it's Johnny. He lives down the street. The parents can talk to Johnny's parents. When a child is in an MMO and has a ""friend"" list a mile long, parents can't really ask ""who is Fragg3rKill3r225?"" Worse, their kid may not really know who that person is either.<p>At the core, IMSafer was about helping parents manage the relationships their kids were building online. As a parent, it is your job to know who has access to your kids, and how they are influencing them.  Most parental control software is billed as keeping porn of the computers. IMSafer was about keeping the bad guys out of the kids lives.",1360867197

5221026,comment,5212543,5218970,1,0,lutusp,,,"> And your chosen simulation starting point highly influences the outcome of the simulation.<p>Yes, it does. The effect I am describing is real, and I simply haven't thought it through in detail until now.<p>1. The starting point for my simulation has both the cicadas and the predators hatching out simultaneously, in year zero. This obviously happens in nature as well as in my simulation (but only rarely).<p>2. Given that starting condition, what is the likelihood that the predator, with a range of reproduction cycles, will succeed in synchronizing with the cicadas again, or (the best of all worlds) over and over in perpetuity?<p>3. The answer is that, if the cicadas adopt a prime-numbered reproduction cycle, the predators are handicapped by the fact that a typical prime number has fewer divisors than a composite number, and divisors are required for synchronization:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_divisors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_divisors</a><p>4. For cases in which the predators and the cicadas are out of synchronization, the outcome for a random difference in years is neutral -- not advantageous, not disadvantageous. I've shown this by adding a loop to my program that tests against a range of differences in years between cicadas and predators. When I do this, the difference between a prime and a composite nearly vanishes (""nearly"" because the advantage of a prime numbered cycle is still present, but is almost completely buried by the much greater number of years where there's no advantage).<p>5. It is only when cicadas and predators hatch out in synchrony (for any one of a number of reasons) does this prime-number effect have any effect on the outcome.<p>6. In terms of natural selection, this leaves the prime-number effect, plus an initial synchronization between cicada and predator, as the only selection advantage, for which the prime-number effect works against the predators.<p>7. Nature, and natural selection, does something my simulation doesn't -- over time, by rewarding reproductive fitness, it amplifies the effect of small advantages, in some cases turning a chance, small fitness advantage into the entire population of a species in the future.<p>8. I could obviously write a more complex simulation that imitates natural selection, one in which a small advantage is eventually turned into a new species, but because of the complexity of such a simulation and the amount of tuning required, I don't think this would represent anything but confirmation bias.<p>My simulation greatly exaggerates the advantage conferred by a prime number, and it assumes something that's almost never true in nature -- that cicadas and predators hatch out in synchrony at the outset. But that set of circumstances does represent a small fitness advantage, and it probably explains the two primary reproduction cycles of the cicada species my paper describes (i.e. 13 and 17 years).",1360866644

They don't just decide to start putting ads up because one day they woke up and thought ""holy shit, we have a billion users! how are we going to support this? Quick! Pull out the ads!"". It's more like they intend to monetize in the future no matter what but the only thing stopping them is adoption. They need users to adopt the service first before its even monetizeable. I'm sure if ads or whatever model was profitable from day 1 they'd be using it. It's not a matter of purposely deceiving users, it's a matter of at what point do the different models actually yield revenue. Once they get to that point you start seeing the monetization happen. It can be from day 1 or 5 years down the road but all startups need to make money.<p>Also, they didn't do anything shady here. If you're following you'll know that they both provided ample notice <i>and</i> offered to share the revenue <i>and</i> you can even opt out. I mean, what do we expect here?

Equal representation of states was conceived of in a time when our nation was very different.  The Senate's current form was an acknowledgement of the fact that each state was sovereign.  The framing of our Constitution almost bears more similarity to the EU than it does to the US that we recognize today, at least with respect to the attitudes towards the relative independence of each state.<p>On top of that, the divisions that made a ""state"" anything more than an arbitrary administrative division based on an accident of history are largely gone.  The urban-rural divide is far more of a dividing line in terms of demography and ideology than state lines are.  Citizens of Los Angeles and Richmond, VA are far more similar to each other than they are to citizens of Shasta County, CA or Wythe County, VA.

5220890,comment,5220072,5220072,23,0,danielha,,,"Hi Jacques, Im Daniel from Disqus. Hopefully I can clear some stuff up.<p>As others in this thread have pointed out, we havent really been shy about what were doing here. You can see a progress update of how things are going on blog.disqus.com (its the second post down as I write this).<p>Weve put a lot of effort into being communicative around what were doing with discovery and advertising (we call it Promoted Discovery). I dont think bait and switch is accurate in describing how we approached this. It was about a year ago that we started talking publicly about the idea of a revenue-share ad product within Disqus.<p>As our ideas matured, we started sharing those details with our userbase. This was about 6 months ago. As with many of the things we do, Promoted Discovery was rolled out gradually so that we could learn and get better. Along the way, we blogged, sent out emails, and surveyed users. Weve done half a year of messaging and were still not done with the full roll-out. It sucks that our messaging didnt reach you, but you should know that you can configure how everything works, or opt out completely, on disqus.com/admin/settings. When new users sign up, they also are introduced to what Promoted Discovery is and have the choice to configure it.<p>As always, were learning through feedback. Especially with the product. Are we finished with the advertising product? Not yet  the product has plenty of room to grow and get a lot better. But its performing well for many publishers and theyre happy with the revenue thats coming in. We care about that because our core discussion product is going to get even better because of it.",1360865731

5220879,comment,5220072,5220448,2,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Like I said, I can totally empathize. No, it's not cool to do that without any notice or consent. You didn't get the notice so as far as you're concerned there was none. I get that, it's totally understandable.<p>That said, I don't think your example of Twitter is a good one. They're too different for that to work. But I don't think getting into that would be very productive for anyone so rather than doing that I'll just say this: while I get where you're coming from I think you're expectations are just north of being totally reasonable. The core if it makes total sense but it starts to unravel when you consider your expectation that you want to "" trust them with the responsibility of not altering our relationship in a material way relative to the terms of service of the moment when I signed up for their service"". That right there, the way I read it, means either ""I expect your company to provide the exact same service and follow the exact same policies that I signed up with <i>forever</i>"" or ""you can only change your service and/or policies when it benefits me"". That's unreasonable. No company on earth keeps its policies and services the same forever. They change every now and then. It upsets people and sometimes a change is negative for us but we adjust and move on.<p>I get why you're leaving but still don't think Disqus is in the wrong. They obviously need to change their service to continue to provide the service. For some, like you, that's not acceptable but its still not <i>that</i> big of a deal. One thing I think you're forgetting is that there's a huge gap here between what you experienced and what the reality is.<p>What you experienced what a major change in service without your consent or knowledge of it at all. That's certainly a reason to be upset.<p>But the reality of the situation is that your case is an exception. Disqus <i>did</i> provide warning <i>and</i> a way to opt out. Now, had you not missed the announcement about this would you still feel the same way today?<p>To be clear, I'm not telling you you're wrong to feel this way. What I'm saying is that it's wrong to characterize Disqus' actions as being sneaky or in breach of trust because they did provide a warning and a way to opt out - you, unfortunately, just happened to not get the memo.

When the patriot act was in affect there were opportunities to turn some of the data over to the gov agencies that deal with exploited children, but it was unclear.<p>In the UK they were allowed to more freely use what they found to put pedophiles behind bars...which they did on more then one occasion.<p>In some cases it appeared that children had installed the software as a desperate cry for help against their abusive family members.<p>In one particular egregious case the offender was involved in group chats where he would try to normalize the behavior to his child by having other sick individuals tell her it was OK.  Then, they would setup times for her to be online with them while terrible acts were perpetrated on her.<p>No one is acting as if this was common.  But, it did happen.  And we weren't selling the chat, running ads against it or in anyway trying to monetize the 'fear' or grief of our users.<p>A lot of people here do not have kids and don't understand how hard it is for parent's to talk their kids about all sorts of issues around sex and drugs and rebellion etc.<p>In many cases IMSafer was their last hope and it was very helpful to a lot of people.<p>We never started it because we wanted to spy on kids or know  people's gossip.  We did it because we realized that parents were ill equipped to deal with the new online world.<p>Porn was a not a concern.  To us that was your child viewing something.  What we were concerned with was someone coming into your child's world and talking to them without your permission.  If the child was having an issue with their parent's these kind of people would pick at that and try to show the child they were on their side to win trust.<p>Places where parent's thought their kids should be safe just weren't and still are not.<p>Also, some kids are susceptible to these kind of attacks by predators.  In some cases parent's had kids who had been sexually assaulted in real life already and they were very afraid, because of their child's mental makeup now, that they would make easier targets.<p>We had adults buying plane tickets for kids and working out details to get them to fly across the country to meet under the guise of some camp the kid was going to, etc.<p>It's real whether you want to deal with it or not.  We did our best to balance online privacy while helping people.<p>I feel like we did a phenomenal job and we didn't sell fear.  It was never part of our marketing or selling.",1360865576

5220831,comment,5215364,5218057,1,0,hosh,,,"The process of meditation is just that, a process. It's not that hard. You're focusing on experiencing things at the base sensational level.<p>So for example, you have a web of thoughts associated with meditation and things like ""You don't get it, until you get it"".<p>There are feelings underneath that. Perhaps a bit of anxiety, frustration. Curiosity. Etc. Your mind interprets those feelings into thoughts.<p>Each feeling then, radiates from parts of your body. For example, anxiety may be a tension that you feel in the chest. It has shape, it has texture. It has pressure. Whenever you get those sensations, your mind automatically interprets that as ""anxiety"". So you focus in on the sensations instead.<p>So now, you're paying attention to the actual sensations. You notice that it isn't a solid thing. That it moves. And if you start zooming into it, it isn't a solid sensation so much as made up of tiny bits of sensations that come in and out very fast, and your mind interpolates the sensation to give an illusion of a single, solid sensation.<p>So now you're there, at the ""bare-metal"", bare sensation level. This is where you are, observing those sensations and not attaching to any one of them.<p>A similar practice is called ""Noting"". You pick a concentration object, and pay attention to it. Things will come up. First will be thoughts. You Note the thought, and then you go back to to the concentration object. Eventually, something will shift and emotions will come up. You Note each as they come up and then go back to the concentration object. Then you get to the bare sensate levels, and you Note each of the things that come up. Then you go back to the concentration object.<p>That is it.<p>There really is not much more than that. The insights some of the other folks have mentioned here, that will come on its own. Your ""job"" while meditating is to Note each and every thing that comes up, let it go, and then go back to the concentration object.",1360865299

5220810,comment,5218288,5219983,9,0,secabeen,,,"Musk certainly didn't explain the drop in mileage.  As I understand it, that drop results from temperature management of the battery.  When stopped in very cold weather, the car uses power to generate heat in order to maintain the battery within safe operating temperatures.  In addition, when the battery is at the low end of that range, it under-reports the available mileage.  That's what generated the Tesla tech's suggestion that it might regain some mileage while driven that morning.  (You can see this in the graph.  The slope of the graph in the little section from miles 400-411 is less than at any other point, and the section after the Norwich charge is also lower, although speeds were also lower here)  However, after some time of driving or charging, the batteries will have risen to optimal operating temperature, and the range projection is correct.  Mr. Broder may have assumed that he was going to recover all of the energy lost overnight, not just the little bit of error in projection.  That may be why he convinced himself to leave with insufficient range to reach his destination.  However, that argument fails Occam's razor in light of his earlier attempts to drive the car to failure and his departure expressly against the advice of the Tesla tech he talked to at that time.",1360865151

All users of all software must make a constant trade-off between assuming abstractions are functioning properly and personally verifying their function, and all software must decide where the line between too little abstraction and too much obscurity should be drawn. When people talk about the ""magic"" in Rails, they mean that Rails has drawn that line quite far toward the abstraction side, which is true.<p>There are some abstractions that are a net positive for security, and some that hinder it. While I don't agree with the condescending attitude of your parent and the many similar commenters, who seem to think no software they've ever written or integrated with has ever had a security issue, I think it is fair at this point to say that the level of abstraction in Rails' handling of user data has been a hindrance to its security.

5220772,comment,5220171,5220663,8,0,sophacles,,,"Um, I think you may not be a native english speaker, so just a semantic note here:<p>inhabit breaks the ""in"" prefix convention (or the ""in"" is not a prefix) in that the meaning of ""inhabit"" is ""to live there"". So an ""inhabitable place"" is on where people could live. If you mean ""a place where people can't live"", the correct term is ""uninhabitable"".<p>Note - the word ""habitable"" means the same thing as ""inhabitable"".<p>It is just one of those confusing English language things, where all rules are more ""guidelines"" than hard rules, and there are exceptions to the exceptions.<p>Another word that follows a similar pattern: flammable and inflammable mean the same thing. Namely ""easy to burn or start on fire"".<p>So I think that to support the empty statement in your first sentence, your second sentence should read:<p>Japan - 4/5 of territory is uninhabitable. China - the same. Russia - Siberia is almost uninhabited.<p><i>edit</i> - The statement ""Siberia is almost inhabited"" is also a funny/sarcastic way of saying ""Siberia is almost uninhabited"".",1360864831

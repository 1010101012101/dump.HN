I could say a lot of bad things about the Danish tax system, and I do so all the time, but the Danish tax authorities are not known to be corrupt. It might be due to subsequent transactions that the article doesn't mention. Also, since the limitation period is around 5 years in this type of cases, the case may have been going on for several years. It's not possible to say from the article.",1362398249

You can audit who does what on every machine, and for stuff that requires root, sudo will log the things people do (of course, if you let people have root shells, that's harder).  The only people who get access to a local account (and/or root, but I still think root should just have a random password that no one knows) are a few sysadmins.  When someone leaves, you kill their account in the LDAP server.<p>Even better, if this is a possibility, put up a VPN, and only allow ssh access via the VPN (using a firewall).  Tie the VPN login to LDAP (and don't let non-VPN-admins ssh directly to the VPN server), and then you can be sure that without a user account in LDAP, no one can log into your servers.<p>Blind-updating systems in production is a terrible idea.

No excuses.<p>You should never even have a ""my first five minutes on a server"" type thing anyway.  Rolling out a new server should be fully automatically operationalized.  The first time you log into the server, it should be completely ready to go.  It should be ready to go without you needing to log into it at all.

If you're ever interested in additional freelance work, do let me know. I do business consulting/digital marketing work and occasionally have a requirement to outsource work to a developer. I have a project that needs quoting on today in fact although I kind of pegged another developer for it, but he hasnt confirmed his availability with me just yet. No promises, but if interested, let's speak.<p>My contact details are on my virtual business card which is in my profile.",1362395121

These are the basic jobs that exist in every country on Earth: Food workers (farmers, waiters, cooks), medical people, and personal assistants (beauty salons, clerks, holy priests, etc).<p>When a country exports a product or service that other countries want, such as cars or silicon chips, that country gains a robust economy and that industry thrives.<p>When a country ceases to export the desirable product/service, or is out-competed, then the industry weakens and jobs are lost.  The U.S. built its robust economy on innovations in many industries.  Now many of those industries have waned, and the computer industry is what's propping us up. The other tent poles have collapsed or weakened.<p>The only thing that can revitalize our economy (and job market) is more innovation from within. We need to export superior products and services, and/or create new industries.",1362394828

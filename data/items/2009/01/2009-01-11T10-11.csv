The startup scene is certainly uncertain at the moment - then again, uncertainty is its defining experience anyhow. Learn to live with uncertainty - balance your work life with things you know you enjoy and that are always there.",1231671446

Instead the language should teach the fundamental principles of programming (like control statements and the concept of subroutine) in a simple environment that is free of complexities.

429051,comment,428594,428704,0,0,jyothi,,,"Good advice. Live on bare minimum. Soon you would realize life isn't all that bad with half the expenses. At the same time, if you do enjoy spending or in other words for many these days getting frugal makes you feel inferior, insecure, might give a sense of failure in that case I would advice you get these feelings out first by speaking it out to someone as to why this is necessary and why this is good.<p>List down your expenses today, sit down and cut out everything that is not necessary. Scale down everything that can. And it doesn't matter if you don't sit in the Starbucks cafe or if your friends find you odd when you don't buy a fancy meal when you go out.<p>For rent see if you can pack it in a home office, or on a sharing basis.<p>Get all of these done in a month, if it gets dragged the feeling as i mentioned before gets too bad and pulls your spirit down as you would keep thinking of every penny.<p>Once you are lean, just put a expense plan and a plan for the company for the expected run way. Go crazy on execution. Good luck!",1231669738

429047,comment,428785,428855,0,0,metaguri,,,"Thank you for this.<p>I think that the field of game theory, and as the most simplistic example, the prisoner's dilemma, shows that libertarianism, as defined by the idea that individuals acting in their own self-interest will create the greatest common benefit, is flawed. Specifically, this will limit the benefit of each individual as well as the aggregate.<p>Individuals acting in their own self-interests categorically do not arrive at optimal solutions for themselves or for the whole society. It's a complete joke, mathematically provable, and thus ridiculous that it's still being argued. We need coordinators. All forms of government have been imperfect at achieving perfect coordination, which has inspired libertarians and objectivists and etc., but that doesn't invalidate the coordinators' work. Instead, a meaningful endeavor would be to improve the scientific rigor and quality of the policy-based coordination. This is what my research as an undergraduate was based around...<p>Libertarian, I invite you to go start an investment bank and act in your own unfettered best interest. I'd be hard pressed to see you not end up in a similar situation to investors in any of the past bubbles and collapses.",1231669238

When you are running out of gas 5-7 months will happen in a jiffy. Ensure you have more run way like get the 5-7 to 10-12 at least and then either do one of these:<p>a) Leave everything and bet on getting funds<p>b) Ditch funds and bet on execution to start breaking even on operations.",1231669169

429043,comment,428776,428776,0,0,antiform,,,"My pet theory is that playing a musical instrument is less common a hobby among programmers now than it was a generation ago, because now programming tends to be associated with ""Computer Science"" as its own discipline, rather than a subdiscipline of math.<p>Near the end of this interview [<a href=""http://tex.loria.fr/historique/interviews/knuth-clb1993.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tex.loria.fr/historique/interviews/knuth-clb1993.html</a>], Don Knuth says that one way CS graduate students have changed since the 70s is that they are less interested in music:<p>""What changes have you seen in the students coming into the computer science program over the years?""<p>""<i>Knuth</i>: There is a very profound change that I can't account for. In the 70s, the majority of our students were very interested in music. The first thing we'd ask them when they came in was 'What instrument do you play?' We had lots of chamber groups and so on. Now almost none of the students are interested in music. I don't know if it's because a different kind of people are enrolling in computer science, or because it's true of all today's students, or what. If you ask computer science students now what their hobby is, the chances are most of them will say 'Bicycling'. I recently had one who played a harmonica, but there were almost no musicians in the group.""",1231669104

429039,comment,428785,428924,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"European health care systems are a double edged sword for startup founders. I have lived in several european countries and researched the matter for some others as well because I like to move around. I'll spare you the details because they are mind boggingly complicated.<p>The issue is that in most countries there is no separate health care system. There is an integrated social security system, including pensions, etc. The problem is that there is a minimum charge that you have to pay irrespective of your actual income.<p>This ""standing charge"" varies a lot. It's negligible in the UK ($15 per month) and (I believe) in Ireland. But it's awfully high in most of continental europe ($300 per month). That increases the burn rate for self funded startups by about a third.<p>The reason why it's so high in some countries is that you don't get to choose what kind of risks you want covered. The assumption is that you pay for the older generation so that the next generation pays for you.<p>It's one size fits all, decoupled from individual choices. You must pay into the retirement system even if you decide (as I have) that you are never going to stop working unless you're unable to (which should be covered by a basic disability insurance which is much cheaper)<p>As a result, many people (including myself at this moment) have no health coverage at all. Either because they cannot afford it or because the rules are so complicated, inconsistent and inflexible that people with unusual CVs slip through the net.",1231668454

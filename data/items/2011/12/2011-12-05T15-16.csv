It shares the same flaw in thinking as the fine: you are attacking the problem from too many angles. Every single person has to alter their behavior for it to work.<p>I think a much easier to implement, less wasteful, and much more likely to work solution is single-source waste disposal and recycling. Charlottesville, VA has this: you throw away everything, and the city outsources sorting and recycling to a single-source waste disposal company. Their job is to recover as much money as possible from recyclables.<p>And the best part is that to improve the efficiency of single-source recycling, you only need to improve your sorting and recycling technologies. You don't need to improve the accuracy of every human who throws away recyclables, which the history of recycling tells us is highly costly while also highly ineffective.",1323100796

3315082,comment,3314676,3314952,2,0,dpark,,,"I would be shocked if the department of education were not tracking outcome at some level. The question is, what should they be tracking? My guess is that they track how scores are correlated with success at the university level. Personally, I think that's a reasonable metric. ""Learning how to learn"" would imply more success in an environment dedicated to learning.<p>""How useful is this in the professional world"" is a pretty crappy metric for deciding what to teach, because the common set of useful topics is pretty small. We could easily stop public education at junior high or earlier if that's the goal. I've never, not once, needed anything from history class, or biology class, or social studies, or literature class in my professional life. Most people have probably never needed algebra, geometry, or trigonometry.  But I'm pretty certain I would be worse off if school stopped at age 10, or if I just repeated the same stuff for 8 years after that.",1323100778

I remember reading about how much work went into each new version of Windows because of bugs and clever code in existing software. Otherwise people who upgraded and found their old software not working anymore would have blamed Windows instead of  their buggy software.<p>You can't boast about Firefox being extensible and then blame plugins because they break it. At least, Firefox should be warning about  troublesome plugins. The more people have to deal with Firefox being  slow and unstable, the more Firefox will be getting a bad rep. Sorry, but you can't fight human nature, you know. You can't change how most users think. If you want to increase market share, your software must be as much dumb-friendly as possible.<p>On my Linux box, Firefox is crashing lots of times a day without giving me any clues about what could have gone wrong. What am I expected to do? To become a Firefox developer? Switching to another browser is an easier path.<p>By saying this, I hope I don't seem unappreciative of Firefox developers' efforts.",1323100715

The solution would <i>appear</i> to be that drivers should be able to tell the kernel ""I can't let you go into deep sleep right now"" when they're active.  Say when the USB camera is actually capturing video, when it isn't it should be perfectly fine to let it go into the deep states.  A hard drive or something else bulk like that is certainly a different beast altogether.  So at least maybe preventing the deep sleep when something in isochronous mode is transmitting data should be fine, (I understand this makes the assumption that USB cameras are sane and drop the isochronous mode when not doing video, I don't know if this is a good assumption).",1323100674

He is on a public school school board. School boards have been known to have adverse selection for dullness for more than a century. Here is Mark Twain's harsh comment on that: ""In the first place God made idiots. This was for practice. Then He made School Boards."" -- Mark Twain, Following the Equator (1903) 2:295<p>Other than that, the author of the submitted article simply describes the school board member as a ""success"" who makes money. The genius of the American political and economic system is that people who desire money more than they desire deep understanding can often achieve that goal. America is a wealthy country, and by world standards a lot of Americans are more successful than what you would expect if you look at the success of people in developing countries who know more and who work harder.<p>The submitted article is by a guest author, but it is part of a regular column series in the Washington Post that takes the consistent line that criticisms of the United States school system for inefficiency and waste of resources are misplaced. As an American who has lived overseas, spending the first part of the 1980s in a developing country, I can't agree with that party line.

You'd register your cards with this company and pay them an annual fee (usually around $20). If your wallet or cards were stolen, you could call their number and they'd call to freeze all your cards. The business was a bit scammy for a few reasons: the way they marketed being a key one; most CC companies won't/can't hold the card holder responsible for fraud anyway because of consumer protection laws, so the service was largely unnecessary. There was a lot of drama in that market at one point.

I think there's real value here. I'm security concious. I use a password manager (1Password) and make full use of its features. I use a strong master password, but I still fear the day my laptop or iPhone are stolen. I worry that they'll find an exploit or some means to get to my password data, at which point I'm screwed. I would like to have the ability to lock down my most sensitive accounts in the event of a security breech.<p>The primary friction revolves around trust. In order to reset my passwords, you'd need my account info. That means my data would be in yet another centralized location. This is bad practice. My password manager is a necessary evil.

The author and subject are criticizing the standardized tests as having been put in place without evidence linking its scores to outcomes. Neither the test nor its champions have any accountability for it.<p>To refute this, we either have to come up with a way of measuring whether streaming students based on their scores is a benefit, or we have to come clean and say it's arbitrary.<p>Saying that high school doesn't teach you anything vocational but you learn how to learn is interesting, but to answer the OP directly we need some evidence showing that students are indeed learning to learn. Otherwise, it's just faith.<p>We should be especially wary of survivor bias hre. Most folks here are educated and pleased with their career arc. It's easy to assume from n=1 that our education is the reason. But many who took the same classes aren't doing so well.

After all, there's nothing to do, so sleeping is sensible. The issue, as I understand it, is that the C6 state in modern CPUs causes them to sleep so deeply that it takes a long time to wake up when an interrupt does occur. From the time of the interrupt to when the handler can run, the high-throughput device (such as a camera, but this also happens for external USB 3.0 hard disks and SSDs, it's just less noticeable as the data isn't realtime and unbuffered) fills up the available DMA buffer(s) and has to stall. So I guess the trick would be to detect when high throughput is expected and not to sleep quite as deeply in those situations. For cameras, that ought to be possible, as they use USB's ""isochronous"" mode, for which you need to decide the bitrate in advance. Storage devices typically use ""bulk"" mode, so the driver would need to detect devices which respond to requests quickly and avoid deep sleep when issuing a bulk command to them.",1323098850

We had been standardized on FF until they expedited their release cycle, which made keeping current too much work (this will change once it updates silently without breaking add-ons), but since we were a Google Apps shop anyway, this doubled our resolve to switch to Chrome.  We kept FF around as a fallback in case we ran into situations where Chrome didn't work (Juniper SSLVPN meetings in Windows, for example).  We actively try to prevent users from accessing IE (removed shortcuts from desktop & Start menu, etc), btw, except for the couple hundred users who actually need it to run legacy apps we have no control over.<p>Note: about 80% of our employees with computers don't have internet access at all, with the exception of a proxy rule that allows them to access Google Apps (and a few other select SAAS apps).

The ability to basically develop a skeleton monitoring UI that I can plug my own software into is fantastic.<p>My only thought is: why is this local to the machine I put it on?  I'd rather have a central repository that I send me data to, like getexceptional.  I don't mind having to set-up the process for each server I spin up, but I would prefer it if the information all aggregated to one source that I could browse through.<p>What I sort of imagine is registering for an Amon account and getting a unique key and identifier.  Whenever I install Amon on a machine or want to call it from my code, I use that unique key and give the hardware a unique name and register my software service (pulling the hardware name from some config file automatically).  Then, when I log into my central Amon account, I can browse through my exceptions and hardware details by machine name or software service.<p>Give me the ability to have multiple logging levels and I am in heaven.<p>Take it one step further: let fall-back be to either a local db or file-system and have a cron-job go through to try to fulfill the upload tasks.<p>That is definitely something I would pay $25-$50 a month for.",1323098298

That's vocational training, and there's nothing wrong with that. Academic education, on the other hand, is about learning to think, about history, rhetoric, science, and all sorts of things that aren't directly applicable to a particular job, but provide a necessary foundation for critical thinking and enlightenment, so to speak.<p>What our system really needs is two streams. An academic stream, for those who choose, and a vocational stream, which is what a large proportion of students and seemingly educators like this guy want.<p>This way, everyone gets what they want. Students truly interested in learning things not directly related to performing a job will have the benefit of a more supportive learning environment, and students who just want to get a job will also attain the required vocational training.<p>It's really win-win.",1323097276

3314806,story,,,2,1,dojomouse,"Ask HN: Good technology stack for IP based Distributed Control Platform?",,"I have a problem of needing to build something and not having a clear idea of the best way to go about it. People who are interested (and especially experienced) in distributed control systems using web platforms - read on! Would love to hear your thoughts and have some guidance through the fog of too many ways to skin a metaphor.<p>I am the lead-and-presently-only developer for a new distributed system control platform consisting of:<p>------<p>1.Distributed units: Initially few (<100) but eventually thousands (in a couple of years) of embedded systems which are scattered all over the place doing 'stuff'. Each unit has a (probably cellular) internet connection (though eventually we may try to use a local area radio mesh to cluster them to share a single connection... or piggyback on a nearby wifi). They are fixed installations. For development I'm using the mBed platform (Cortex M3) as there's an existing community, libraries, and hardware... these few being of far higher value than custom hardware or advanced debug tools at this stage.\nEach of these units has enough brains to look after itself in the short term when necessary/in event of unexpected outages (up to 1 min or so with no observable negative impact) but should generally be 'online' and able to respond to higher level commands (start; stop; rollover; reset; increase output to y; change parameters b, c, and d) with low latency (preferably below 100ms, but could live with 1s if this changes everything completely). They also need to be able to feed data up to the higher level controller, preferably also in soft real time (perhaps 20 variables of 16ish bit each, once per second... though in reality will only send when there is a delta).<p>2. Data connection: A connection/protocol able to reliably and securely support this sort of communication. As mentioned I'm not talking banks/trains/nuclear-plants reliability and security... but should be at least 'I want to read my email online when I feel like it, and stop curious and somewhat sinister people reading it at the same time' level.<p>3. Controller/Server/Database/analytics: Central controller that can aggregate all this incoming data and send out new set points etc based on decisions made at central level. Data should be stored for future retrieval and continuous analysis, preferably in some form that lends itself to various (somewhat simplistic to start with) 'Big Data' type analytical and optimization processes.<p>4. Some sort of browser based front end so curious owners of the distributed systems can log in and see how there flock is going.<p>-------<p>For my background - I'm an electrical engineer; have experience developing in C/C++ (though mostly from a control implementation perspective, and supported by much more capable software engineers for the tricky OS stuff) for hard real time systems. Have almost no experience at all with servers, clouds, interwebs, etc.<p>Since starting this project I've managed to hack together the framework of a rough demo with a LAMP stack server, reasonable facsimile of what we want for the front end (coded up from scratch in HTML/CSS, using Ajax for most of the server I/O - I'm so proud!) and as mentioned the mBed as the distributed target. Everything does not yet work elegantly, but most of the parts do, and I can more or less see how to get from here to 'working' demo.<p>The issue, and hence question (finally!): I'm sure I haven't built this in anything like an optimal way... and probably not even an adequate way for what I want the system to do in a few years. So where do I go from here?$<p>There are tens (hundreds) or possible candidates for the server, for the database, for the connection.\nDo I use MySQL? MongoDB? NoSQL? A big long text file?\nDo I use HTTP? Modbus/TCPIP? Carrier pigeons with a highly refined bribe system?\nDo I use Apache? Node.js? Tornado?<p>From playing around with the mBed I discovered Tornado and Websockets. Websockets at least seem to provide a lot of the functionality I want for the connection between 1 & 3 (distributed units and central controllers). So I'm beginning to dig into Tornado a bit and see if that's the right thing, but am painfully aware that I'm feeling my way in a dark room filled with things that I wouldn't recognize half of even with the lights ON.<p>So, if anyone remains after this too-long background: What would you suggest as a stack to build all this on? I guess my key question is about level 3 (the OS/DB/Server/Scripting/whatever), but also about whether secure-websockets are a good solution for level 2 considering the data requirements (1000 units+, 100 bytes data/unit.second during peak periods, some delays acceptable during peaks, bidirectional data flow).<p>For now I'll keep looking at Tornado/wss and trying to get them to work properly with my mBed (there are some reasonable walk throughs on the mBed website I'm following, so I'm not completely in the dark) but would very much appreciate some input from an wiser and more experienced soul (or just wiser/smarter - I'm not proud!).<p>Thanks in advance...",1323097228

I recently had the password requirements experience with quickbooks and their silly requirements (<a href=""http://imperialwicket.com/quickbooks-online-password-fails"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imperialwicket.com/quickbooks-online-password-fails</a>).<p>Like many have said, I have a 6-10 password bank of relatively complex passwords that I use for services I may need to easily use on alternate computers. For everything else, I use randomly generated values (usually 24 char, including alphanum, special, hyphen, underscore, and white space) which I store in a Keepass db.  I keep the Keepass db on a flash drive which I keep with me virtually all the time.<p>This technique is frustrating at times, but I like knowing that if a password is compromised, it's either something that can quickly and easily be addressed, or it's something that I really don't need to address.",1323097224

7095592,comment,7094927,7094927,31,0,kgrin,,,"Whenever these cases come up, we tend to look at it with a status-quo bias - assuming that <i>of course</i> this data exists, and it&#x27;s a question of whether it should be &quot;free&quot; (whatever your interpretation of that term). But in reality, things like YBB+ can impact the existence of the data in the first place - in this particular case, the evaluations existing in as comprehensive a form as they do depends on Yale&#x27;s explicit sponsorship (having professors hand out the eval forms, etc.)<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the policy implication is - there&#x27;s no easy rule here. But it&#x27;s worthwhile to keep in mind that &quot;information wants to be free, Yale can&#x27;t decide how it&#x27;s used&quot; (an attitude that&#x27;s a bit of a straw-man, but not too far from what some have argued here) ignores the reality that the next time the Yale faculty debate whether or not to collect and collate evaluations (or whether to have a numeric score component), they may well decide not to. (Which, of course, is a principle that applies to other cases of data collection - sometimes it&#x27;s best not to collect it, just because you don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll be [mis-]used...)",1390316354

Later one just re-uses ones own realizations and adapts them to new requirements.<p>Also I think that it should be not just linear bottom-up process, but recursive one, when you regularly &quot;call yourself&quot; with the old problem, but a &quot;new you, evolved with experience&quot;. Starting from the bottom, from basic building blocks is crucial.

On Spotify and Rdio finding good playlists is difficult. Spotify has been getting better at this but it isn&#x27;t great yet. Beats seems to have spent a lot of time crafting A LOT of really great playlists and they seem to be where I&#x27;m spending most of my time.

Having worked for 2 years at an adult dating/advertisement company, let me wake you people up.\nBadoo&#x27;s billing struck me as ingenious, but still a sham, like 95% of the online dating world.\nHowever, my line of work was in adult-dating so that&#x27;s a whole different ballgame of faking and scamming.\nThey hired me for doing &quot;billing&quot; . I was like &quot;ok&quot; yeah I have experience with implementing payment modules and such in e-commerce, been doing that forever...\nLike to these people, it was magic. And what they considered &quot;billing&quot; was basically acquisition or conversion through on-page shams and tricks.\nIt had little to do with connecting API&#x27;s:<p>A lot of fine print and cross-selling, up-selling. The same biller allowed to use different descriptors on the creditcard statement to reduce chargebacks....\nAPI&#x27;s in (adult)dating, like anything else seem to have come back from time in Marty McFly&#x27;s Delorean.<p>Still, the majority of dating sites are just a sham. Most of them copies (or.. &quot;white labels&quot; as they like to call them).\nDon&#x27;t you guys know &quot;Twoo.com&quot; ? iz like exactly the same as Badoo..<p>Actually, on-site scammers - they usually give you a phone number from the Philippines - are great because they provide the only &quot;real&quot; (as in human) interaction with the users.<p>Still Badoo relies heavily on fake profiles and automated actions. I myself have been implementing such &quot;angel&quot; features in an adult-dating platform. \nMorally abject, didn&#x27;t really like it except I took it on to learn NodeJS and hopefully get something out of the equity deal and use my money for something good.<p>Badoo (and any other of such) basically pleads with you when you&#x27;re not a subscriber:\nThey start mailing you profile visits (&quot;someone is checking you out&quot;) or you get random &quot;likes you&quot; from cute 18-19 y old girls.  \nIntermediately you get spammed with what we call the &quot;special offers&quot;. Discount ledgers or &quot;sign up before dd/mm and get x% off&quot; e-mails. Yes you&#x27;re a real popular guy at Badoo if you don&#x27;t have any cash.\nYou will even get some replies on your messages if you don&#x27;t pay.<p>Become a subscriber and bamboozle, all the mailings stop, interaction basically dies down.\nNow you&#x27;re such unpopular wow?? such amaze.. how did that happen.\nNow that they&#x27;ve made billing convenient for you, you start doing micro payments for popularity.<p>Alright, enough of this... I put $100 in this site, and not giving me any ROI. I get better ROI at the titty bar.... better unsubscribe...\nOh wow, why did I do that, seems like all the girls are checking me out just now that I stopped billing. wtf???\nseriously :P<p>The only real real dating site I&#x27;ve encountered in this age, is OkCupid!  And i&#x27;m pretty darn sure that they also juice up their listings (as far as activity goes). although they do not need it as much, and I&#x27;ve actually had some real interactions on OkCupid!<p>So who&#x27;s getting laid?

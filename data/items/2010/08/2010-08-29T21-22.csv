You're missing out on a lot of fun, it won't hurt you, and the sooner you start practicing this the sooner you'll get the hang of it.</i><p>I agree, but I would extend it beyond ""that girl"" and say that it applies to anyone that you think seems interesting. Everyone craves human interaction and almost everyone has a story to tell. Don't be afraid to say hello.<p>Another bit I would add is to avoid high debt. This will be hard because our entire society is set up to take on debt in your college years and then pay it off once you get a good job afterward. I'm 26 now, and I have nearly $60K in debt. I have to pay a minimum of $1000 a month on those debts, while my rent, utilities, and other costs typically come in under $1000. If I didn't have debt, I could bartend 10 nights a month and make enough to live on. Instead, I work 40-50 hours a week in a tech job that I hate, leaving me thoroughly uninspired and unmotivated to do personal programming work once I get home.<p>My grandmother gave me similar advice and I didn't take it to heart. All I thought was, ""I can work my butt off now at $5-8 an hour, or I can take on debt and pay it off after school when I'm making $50-70K per year."" Your future self will be pretty annoyed at you if you use this same rationalization.",1283119049

I would give the same advice to any startup: don't trust Facebook and don't give them any access to your startup or plans.<p>Period. End of story.<p>If an entrepreneur needs any evidence of the trustworthiness of Facebook, simply talk to folks inside of Quora, FourSquare, Twitter and Zynga (among others). I'm sure you've spoken to folks inside these companies, like I have, who are infuriated with Zuckerberg's blatant stealing (without innovation).<p>At every chance they can get, Facebook has simply stolen. Given their scale, bringing them inside the incubators is, well, mind boggling.<p>If you're a startup company you should be <i>avoiding</i> Facebook and their staffers.<p>I'm sure you have great intentions PG, and you know I respect all that you've accomplished, but don't dismiss me. I really don't need press because, to a certain extent, I <i>am</i> press.<p>Add to that the fact that I'm massively overexposed (especially here on HN), and you're claim that I'm link-baiting feels disingenuous.<p>Like you, I love startups and entrepreneurship. I only want to see folks do well and not get ripped off by Facebook, which I consider the most unethical company in technology.<p>One only need to look at the mountain of lawsuits they've generated for proof of this. Facebook's long list of lawsuits are not from ambulance-chasing law firms mind you, they are by <i>PARTNERS</i> and <i>FRIENDS</i> of Zuckerberg's! Oh yeah, a lot of the lawsuits and complaints are also by privacy groups and government agencies trying to protect citizens.<p>If Zuckerberg has no problem screwing his friends, partners and customers, what do you think he will do to a three-person startup that might innovate its way into being competition for him?<p>I fear you've made a big mistake letting the fox into the henhouse.<p>Startups: listen to PG on everything since he's brilliant--but take my advice on this one. :-)<p>best jason",1283118999

But so far, there's not a lot to show for it. Sometimes I've spent years not doing much of anything except looking at sunsets, walking in parks, reading books, and being creative, and all the things that are supposed to make life wonderful. These idle years weren't all a bowl of cherries (mostly it was due to depression) but it still wasn't so different from the slow sort of lifestyle exalted above. And I still find it lacking.<p>We only have a limited time here, and in our age, individuals have extraordinary leverage. Isn't that also a reason to try as hard as we can to make some kind of dent in the universe? If I forgo a few sunsets, but make a thousand people's lives better, did I really do it wrong?<p>When it comes to regrets, the literary image that stays with me comes from Charles Dickens' <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. This part is usually omitted from popularizations and films. Marley's ghost has delivered the warning about the three spirits, but also shows him a vision of spirits wandering the earth:<p><i>The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went.  Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.  Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives.  He had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below, upon a door-step.  The misery with them all was, clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever.</i>",1283118477

If you want to develop new algorithms, prove theorems about them, etc., there is a heavy math focus, although in terms of departments, you'd probably be more likely to do it in a CS department with a strong ML group, than in either a math or stats department. If you want to <i>use</i> ML though, the skills are quite different. A good handle on statistics is still necessary, so you know when to use which techniques, and how to interpret the results, but a lot of the math used in ML as a research area is used mainly to develop the algorithms and prove theorems about them, and isn't as relevant if you're looking at them mainly as predictive modeling or data-mining tools to apply to various domains.",1283118282

Destined to lose.  Nobody wins, not FB, not YC, not founders.   All three parties joined in making a mistake.  Oops.  Boring case.<p>1a. Destined to win barely.  Maybe YC finds a break-even exit.  FB is incrementally helped.  Maybe the founders are happy or maybe restless.  Boring case.<p>2. Destined to win big by unique, non-replaceable opportunity.   E.g., Founders have an exclusive contract with Bob Dylan and their product is going to go big... they can stay independent.  They've got an ""f.u."" contract with Dylan.  FB wins a little on the margins of the revenues of the new firm.  YC and the founders win really big.  The only problem is, such unique, exclusive opportunities are rare.<p>3. The start-up OR AN UPSTART COMPETITOR (most often Facebook itself or a better ""friend of FB"") will win big and it's winner take all.  This is half of the case that has Jason Calacanis' panties twisted.  FB can often (we presume, act as if we knew to be true) brute force the firm out of the market by replacement or force them into an early acquisition with the threat of replacement.<p>There are two sub-cases:<p>3a) Facebook's dominance as market-maker cum market-player is hostile towards YC and the start-up.   FB wins.  YC and founders essentially break even or worse.<p>3b) Facebook is in a cooperative mode (e.g., FB invests products and services in the YC firms and then dominates by friendly acquisition or similar).  FB wins big - low stakes and high return on their perceived value as market maker.  YC wins non-stellar but more reliable returns:  a respectable interest rate on 20K outlays.  That's a sweet spot for YC (they aren't playing the lottery, they're managing a fund).   Founders get, in effect, a very modest bonus and then either a (likely crappy, per Jason) job or just a nice bullet point on their C.V.<p>Uncompressed, Jason has a reasonable concern I think.  There's a new case where founders barely win and wonder if the struggle was worth it, while YC and FB are quite happy.<p>And, nobody asked, but I think YC's fundamental mistake is interest in funding FB-related start-ups at all.   The problematics of letting one particularly odd firm create and dominate a market like that are such that I think YC should generally shun the unfathomable risks and complexities.<p>I see the deal as YC submitting a bit to FB's domineering tendencies because by submitting on these terms, YC does OK and the founders aren't creamed.   A better solution (in my biased view) would have been to decide just to not fund anything that cares about FB's actions at all.",1283116950

Otherwise you would expect, all other things being equal, that older founders would be disproportionately represented in the selected teams, assuming likely success is one of the determinants of the ""best people"".<p>The higher risk and difficulty of maintaining a desirable lifestyle on a ramen income therefore likely have two impacts:<p>1) Fewer older startup founders apply as noted.<p>2) The perception of older founders as being more likely to succeed is offset by the perception, conscious or otherwise, that they are less likely to succeed on a ""just enough"" level of funding.<p>If this is true, I doubt it's a conscious selection bias, and there's nothing wrong in it.

You can guess the other way, as grandalf does, and most current minimum wage earners would be either entirely or near entirely unaffected.  Without numbers, either one is still a guess.",1283115931

My startup has been running with the traditional FB Page and built a small fan base through our traditional Facebook Page. After adding the ""Like"" button, we now have a new, second page that is mapped to our URL.  The issue is, we are starting from scratch with the new setup (the Open Graph URL generated Page starts at zero Likes and there seems to be no way to link the old Page to this new one). Can we tie the two together? Thanks.",1283115880

Today's social networks are simply fancy content aggregators.<p>2. Today's content providers have no standard way to syndicate their content while maintaining some level of control on how that content gets shared.<p>3. I'm introducing the concept of a Personal Digital Asset (PDA) as a potential tool in dealing with content syndication and sharing controls.<p>I'd love to get your opinion on this wacky idea I had on a lazy Sunday afternoon!<p>http://www.lanceramoth.com/blog/2012/05/social-networks-killed-the-content-providers",1337561996

It's like you don't even realize that there are third world migrant workers picking our fruit because every single one of those unemployed college graduates is, to put it bluntly, too spoiled and decadent to do the work. Or that the lifestyle of those unemployed college graduates is made possible by armies of Chinese factory workers.<p>I don't mean this as a personal attack on anyone. Frankly, I'm probably too spoiled and decadent to pick fruit all day too. But I'm willing to admit that's a weakness on my part, and I'm uncomfortable living in a world where I have to rest my weight on the backs of those who will gladly and happily do what I'm either incapable of or unwilling to do.<p>The one saving grace for us is that if we depend on people who do things we can't or won't do, then we can climb up the value chain and make them depend on us doing things they can't or won't do. Decadent as it may be to sit in an air-conditioned office and make stupid iPhone games for other spoiled, decadent first worlders to play, at least that guy living in the Foxconn dormitory and assembling iPhones all day might be grateful to us for making sure he still has work. I'm sure the guys who made ""Angry Birds"" boosted demand just enough to buy a few weeks breakfast, lunch, and dinner for maybe a couple thousand Chinese factory workers.<p>Pretending there isn't enough work out there and hence we should pay people to do nothing is just an excuse for cultural laziness. I can't imagine any social justice in subsidizing first-world people to contribute nothing and continue to live off the backs of third-world workers. Once those Chinese factory workers and Mexican fruit pickers are out of work because we can replace them with robots, then we can talk.",1337561738

On the other hand, Postgres's I/O scheduling -- while far from state of the art compared to proprietary databases -- is probably better than leaving it to the operating system entirely, particularly for writing.<p>500,000 small hstores should perform just fine.  We have tables with millions or quite possibly billions of not-entirely trivially sized hstores sitting around on a pretty unremarkable machine with a few indexes.<p>Hstore's storage format is probably not tuned as carefully (it's basically text) as bson, and yet its indexing can be richer (GIN/GiST).  Binary formats can be overrated, though, especially when the amount of meta-information is quite or people use them with strings.

4000755,comment,3997607,3999006,4,0,mkramlich,,,"The vast majority of dev workstations in the real world have far less than 8 cores and 32 GB of memory. Also it's not about ""bloat"" in some abstrance sense, I've found, but rather about the noticeably slower interactivity, the mysterious delays, the mysterious crashes, and the overwhelming surplus of unnecessary visual/cognitive vomit occupying the screen real estate at any time. Oh and Byzantine IDE configuration option panels. And the always-harder-to-automate nature of GUI interfaces. And the local drive bias. And every other ""feature"" they add that you're supposed to appreciate as some new gift from the gods turns out to be something you could already do, for free, on the command-line or with a vi/emacs-style terminal-friendly UI. I have a lot of experience working in both paradigms and I know which one I've found to be better. I think the last fast/simple/non-crashy/non-visual-vomit IDE I experienced was TurboC in the early 90's. It's been mostly downhill ever since.<p>I think a lot of shops that think they need 200 developers, and thus it's easier to get Java than Python developers and thus should use Java, etc., may have made a base assumption after which all following deductions are dependent. If instead of starting with assumption you need 200 developers you instead think we only want a few smart/elite developers, then you can have a smaller total headcount, a less enterprisey tech stack, and less mindless process and makework. I've seen and heard of small teams that run circles around large bloated enterprise shops for just these kinds of factors.<p>Also I guarantee you that in the vast majority of real world programming situations needed by large companies the software is mostly not CPU-bound but rather IO-bound, and any greenfield or maintenance development is mostly bug-bound or developer-hour-and-quality-availability-bound and bureaucracy-bound. CPU time is cheap and lots of ways to parallelize, defer and cache. Software developers are not cheap. Well, worse software developers can be ""cheaper"" superficially but end up being more expensive due to being slower, dumber or less knowledgable of implementation options, and needing much more of them. CEO salaries and their royal court are extremely NOT cheap.",1337561207

You put on the e-brake, and assess your situation. The nearest gas station is 20 miles away, and it's snowing, so there is no way you can walk it, and there is no other traffic on the road to offer you some help. Sucks to be you, but you should have planned better.  You could let go of the e-brake, and roll down the mountain in reverse, but there is just a deserted valley at the bottom - it would not improve your situation.  But, a ha! You realize that you are only 20' from the top of the hill. the gas station is still 20 miles away, but it's all down hill. If you can push your car to the top of the hill, you can then roll all the way to the gas station using gravity to power your car.<p>But, alas, a lawyer pops out of the woods, and hands you a document stating that you are not allowed to push your car up the hill and then use gravitational potential energy to get to the gas station, because Acme, Inc has been issued a patent on that process, and you are not allowed to use it without their consent. Coincidentally, you have an ongoing lawsuit against Acme, Inc, for a completely unrelated reason. They tell you ""Drop this lawsuit, and we'll let you use our push-up-the-hill process to save your car"".<p>That is pretty much what happened in this circumstance.<p>Yes, the engine failed to operate properly. No one is blaming the patents for that. The satellite got stuck in an unusable orbit due to the engine failure, but was otherwise still functional. Since launching things into orbit is very expensive, and the things being launched are very expensive, the company that owns the satellite will try pretty much anything within reason to recoup their costs. One option, popularized by Belbruno and Ridenoure from an similar incident in the past, involves using only a small amount of fuel, to send the satellite around the moon and back, which would make it possible to put the satellite into the correct orbit around the earth. THIS is what was denied them due to the patent on the low energy orbital transfer that Boeing apparently has. So, it is not the fault of the patent system that the rocket initially failed, but it is the fault of the patent system that the company was not legally allowed to recover it's still-functional property.<p>edit: I should add that, yes, SES Americom may have committed insurance fraud if they didn't disclose to their insurance company that the satellite was recoverable for $50M(the cost of dropping the lawsuit against Boeing). However, that doesn't change the fact that they were prevented from essentially running their engine at particular times due to patents.",1337560068

    b) It's sneaky. I don't really know what 
    information they have and how they use it. I just 
    have a couple of completely meaningless words 
    from their privacy policy.

    c) I don't know the price I'm paying.

    The last point is the most important one. 
    The value and the risk associated with a 
    particular piece of information greatly depends 
    on what other information it is combined with, 
    but I can't control that. The company could get   
    acquired tomorrow by some ad behemoth that knows 
    a lot of other things about me, so the price I'm 
    paying could change after the fact. That's not 
    the way payment works. I have to know the price 
    I'm agreeing to pay before I enter that contract.

Or do you mean it will <i>always</i> be 50 years in the future - like communism in the Soviet Union? Then it makes total sense.<p>> And then people with money to loan out can factor the coming jubilee into their credit decisions.<p>Can you venture a guess what that decision would be? If you have money and you know you debtor will be able to refuse to return your money in, say, 2 years - how willing you would be to lend it out? Now also consider that collection can take multiple years - and consider when credit markets would completely shut down? 5 years before the Jubilee? 10 years? 
Will the banks also be allowed to refuse to pay interest on deposits in Jubilee - or if they are not, where the money to pay interest will come from if everybody would be defaulting on their loans at once? In fact, will the banks be allowed to just refuse to pay out the deposits at all - since term deposit is nothing more than a loan you give to the bank? And if not, where those deposits are coming from since these money are already given out as loans and forgiven on Jubilee?",1337559488

When the student defaults, the government repays the note holder as a matter of course, then the government goes after the student. The bailout is already guaranteed. The students will not be discharged of their debt anymore than the homeowners got their mortgages paid. What happened is the feds bailed out the bank losses, AND allowed the banks to evict the homeowners AND allowed the banks to keep the houses and resell them. But all this was only a tiny amount of the cost. On top of this were the CDOs and CDSs totalling, according to one estimate, one quadrillion dollars, more than all the assets in the world. The banks/investors/speculators are still being bailed out of these ""losses"" which were never real losses and only represented losses to unearned and absurd gains they hoped to make as part of a pyramid scheme.<p>The people stuck with the debt at the bottom of the pile don't get bailouts.",1337559122

Looking at history objectively, I don't think it can be plausibly argued that technological progress now is slower than it was 60 years ago. And we are taking big new risks on a variety of fronts, including massive experiments in the genetic engineering of worldwide agriculture, smaller but even more dangerous experiments with genetically modified viruses, and experiments in large-scale decentralized automation of large segments of our financial systems, not to mention the ongoing global experiment in CO2 saturation that we are conducting unabated. You can argue for the benefits of all these experiments, but you can hardly say we've become risk averse.

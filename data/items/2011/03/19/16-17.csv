2344057,comment,2343776,2343776,0,0,originalgeek,,,"I sense a slight tinge of guilt in your post where you mention being selfish.  Choosing what is right for you is always acceptable.  If any of your co-founders cannot release you with love, then it is they who are being selfish.  I'm going through the opposite right now, losing one of my best employees to a better opportunity.  She has to choose what's right for her.<p>I would not rule out other, perhaps funded startups, during your job search.  You won't get as big a piece of the action as a founder, but that may be irrelevant, depending on where you land.<p>On the other hand, being an entrepreneur is not for everyone.  You seem to deeply desire autonomy.  The are two truths about autonomy.  First, one is never fully autonomous, there are always customers that will hold you accountable.  Second, autonomy has it's price.  The most successful entrepreneurs usually have a long stream of failures in their wake.  It's about taking and applying the lessons from the failures, redoubling efforts, sometimes living an austere lifestyle while figuring out how to keep the bills paid, and trying again.  Like I said, it's not for everyone.  I have many times considered leaving my venture for the stability of a steady paycheck at a ""regular"" job.  I would be much less concerned about the future for my family and children.  But I know that choice would be a choice to accept a mediocre vision for my children, cutting off access to the best toys/learning tools, schools, etc. and I want better than that for them.  I believe the same mediocrity would ripple through my career path as well.  That pressure has caused me to apply the past lessons, and take risks, some of which are paying off.<p>The bottom line, reward comes with risk.  At a corporate job, the big wigs and shareholders are taking most of the risk, so they get most of the reward.<p>Your CEO, from the limited information you have presented, sounds perhaps like he is more charismatic than he is in possession of the skills necessary to steer your venture toward profitability.  If he has time to check in on all the guys 2-4 times a day, it sounds to me like he has run out of ideas or has no real sense of direction for doing what is needed, securing customers or funding, or just choosing a vision for a product and keeping the lid on the feature set until v1.0 is achieved.  I am also wondering what kind of legal agreements you have in writing for your startup.  He sounds like he is setting himself up to be the lone founder, claim the lion's share of the spoils, and screw you and the other co-founders.",1300553906

Good science demands it.<p>Good science would also suggest Tumblr should get some experts to help them discover anything else that might be lingering, which they're planning to do. Much like a peer review process.<p>Your attitude is important for those in the security industry as it pushes things forward, but remember that not everyone has the time to spend on it that you might. It can either be an asset or the bane of your existence. As an asset, you get paid for the things you understand because others don't.

Not really something that 'launches' anyways.<p>As far as what he could do to improve it, here are some ideas:\n1. IRC is a solid and robust chat platform that has been around for a long time, you should really look towards what makes it strong and how it is used. Take that and apply what works towards the web app.<p>2. After building the foundation on solid chat technology, add in things people expect from a web app. I wouldn't mind seeing actual profiles with publicly available logs and what channels they frequent. You could add friends and what not and know when they login and what channels they frequent as well.<p>3. Since Node.js is so versatile, look at making it compatible with IRC so that IRC clients can connect to it and function as you would expect. This would be an added feature, but could be huge. Not everyone likes using their browser to chat, I know I don't.<p>Good luck with it, glad to see someone making some fun stuff with Node.js and showing it off.",1300553622

I have always had projects ""on the side,"" but those have (so far) never led anywhere, and I can only dream of joining a startup -- Why? Because the money in corporate work is good enough, the job is stable, and you are right that if someone takes you under their wing, you can go far.<p>On the flipside, upper management is usually not a good place for (ex-)developers (which means less money). Maybe it's just my perception of things, but it seems like you already have to be a part of the upper management club to join the upper management club, if that makes sense.<p>Another bad point is you have to deal with people that you will never be sure how they even got a job. This can be very frustrating at times because sometimes these people can hold a position of power, and you just have to learn to say ""yes sir"" in the face of an obviously-bad decision -- in fact, you may be experiencing this right now.<p>Finally, you there can be a huge amount of bureaucracy that you have to deal with and this can be frustrating if you're the type that just wants to get stuff done.<p>After joining corporate, you might not want to join a startup because your job is ""cushy"" and you don't want to take on that much risk.

2344032,comment,2343740,2343740,0,0,meowzero,,,"I think his post is a bit extreme. It depends on a lot of factors on whether to buy a house or not. I think most of his reasons aren't really valid for not owning a home.<p>I'll make some comments on his financial arguments:<p>A) If you pay off your home fast, you won't have anymore mortgage payments. And you actually own something that you might be able to sell later, getting some money back. If you rent, you won't see that money ever again. So technically your cash is good as gone if you rent. If you own, you can get something back at least.<p>This depends on the house you buy and the market. For example, I rented a lot until I found a good deal on a house. Now I pay less on my mortgage than on my apartment I rented.<p>The rent may increase every year too. At every place I stayed, they always raised the rent every year. At least with the home, you don't have to worry about that since you have the same mortgage payment every month.<p>B) Usually the seller pays the closing costs, especially at the current market. If not, negotiate so the seller pays. You don't usually have to worry about this if you're buying a home.<p>C) He's right on this one. The comfort of calling the maintenance person at my apt was one of the benefits over owning.<p>D) This is simliar to A). It depends on the market and the home you get. For me, the taxes + mortgage turned out to be simliar to what I paid in rent. Plus I now get a huge refund because of my deductions. So I paid around the same amount as my rent, and I got a bigger refund on my taxes.<p>E) I agree with the author. This is probably one of the disadvantages of owning a house.<p>F) I don't consider my home an investment. It's a place I bought to live in. I don't expect to make a profit from it. I have my stocks and mutual funds that I consider to be investments.<p>Now my comments on his personal reasons on not owning a home:<p>A) I agree with the author. This is same as E) above. I don't know why he put it twice.<p>B) I don't see how this is a reason not to own a home. The benefits of owning a home is that you can do whatever you want with it without worrying about the landlord looking over your shoulder.<p>C) I don't understand this argument as a reason for not buying a home.<p>D-F). Not everyone is same. Some people's hobbies are gardening and maintaining the home. They actually enjoy doing it. Some people like the sense of stability. But if you're like the author and like to change things up a lot and be mobile, a house is probably not good for you.<p>G) I got stressed when I rented because the landlord needed to raise the rent every year. Then I had to go through the stress of negotiating the rent increase. If I wasn't successful, I had the stress of budgeting for the higher rent or had the stress of packing all my junk up, finding a new place, and moving. So renting isn't always stress free.<p>H) This is true. But if you plan wisely, you should still have a lot of cash available for emergencies, even after buying your home.",1300553406

2343935,comment,2343740,2343740,0,0,frankus,,,"The man's got a point. And I say that as a homeowner of nine years.<p>The first point I would make is that unless you're independently wealthy, you're either going to be renting housing or renting money. All else equal, thirty years later you'll own some money or you'll own some property, respectively. The trick is in the ""all else equal"" part, because given rent versus price ratios, interest rates, and inflation expectations one or the other may be a far better deal.<p>Secondly, in a lot of desirable areas renting an equivalent  property is far cheaper than buying. A lot of that has to do with the fact that rentals aren't usually quite as nice in terms of location, condition, and accoutrements as owner occupied places, but the effect often remains after correcting for this.<p>Good reasons to own your house? If you have pets, finding a rental can be really hard. If you enjoy renovating and general handypersonship maintenance might be a feature as well as a bug. Finally, if market conditions make it a no-brainer.<p>Tl;dr don't pay more in mortgage than you'd be comfortable paying in rent, and don't feel like you need to own a place to be a grownup.",1300551623

He's really smart and one hell of a great guy but he wants to hold the power/control in his hands as much as possible-- a ""benevolent dictatorship"" of sorts. I also think he has a great vision and would be excellent in a lot of contexts.<p>My issue, personally, is that I am doing this to get to a position of high autonomy-- and that may never happen, I'm coming to realize. I figure that if I work to get rich, I'll probably be miserable and might fail and, even if I succeed, won't be for the better for it (though if I have kids, they will be). Or I can work toward autonomy and enjoyment, maybe get rich and maybe not, but at least have the rare privilege of actually <i>enjoying</i> going to work. I'm doing the startup because, if it pans out, I'll have a really cool job and lots of autonomy. Maybe. But if the CEO decides I'm ""just a developer"" and I end up answering to some hired-gun VP, then I'll have no choice but to quit and, if my equity doesn't do well, years of my life will have been lost.<p>There's a certain natural distrust I have of business people. Most of them don't mean to do any harm, but they waste others' time and ruin lives with their overconfident promises and their willingness to trample others' interests if they see it as the profitable thing to do. On the other hand, a dismal realist like me, one who acknowledges that failure is <i>possible</i>, can't inspire people in the way profound promises can, now can he?<p><i>three years and still no launch is an insane amount of time for a startup. Regardless of what the reason may have been, it should definitely not have taken that long.</i><p>I'm not sure how I feel about that one. First of all, there were definite (but forgivable IMO) time-eating mistakes we made in the process, and our first technical hire is brilliant but was a really bad choice for the first programmer, and we're still paying that down. As for time-to-launch, I think there are a lot of ""social"" startups that can be hacked together in a few weeks, but deep technology takes longer. Maybe not 3 years, but definitely 12 to 18 months.<p><i>As a developer, assuming you're good, the market is wide open.</i><p>I think I'm both too good and not good enough. ""Too good"" in the sense that I die a little bit when I have to use languages like Java instead of languages like Haskell or at least Python. ""Not good enough"" in the sense that I didn't become a programmer until age 24 and, despite natural talent, I feel like I have a <i>lot</i> of catching up to do. There's so much in software that I've never touched; it was only a few months ago that I learned HTTP and REST.<p><i>PS As a side note, if you're ever interested in joining another startup, I am looking for a cofounder (made a post on here earlier).</i><p>Thanks. I'll look at it. I'm actually not looking to move until mid-summer. Given that this is a tiny company, I'm more inclined to give 2-3 months' notice than the standard 2 weeks.",1300551188

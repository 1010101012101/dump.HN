At first it wasn't too hard to get around, using Google's cache, some web proxies and then Tor.<p>But the state is cracking down, cutting off more of these avenues. Google cache is now blocked, deep packet inspection is analysing traffic that comes from web based proxies and blocking anything... that's normally blocked. And finally Tor is being effectively tackled.<p>It's public list of access points to the Tor network is blocked, and now Tor bridges are being blocked hours and minutes after them being made available. Tor is being defeated.<p>Top this off with an ever growing list of useful websites and services being cut off; half of anything Google does, Dropbox, and now Zoho.com's services.<p>Just as I begin a small web development company based in China, we get our first customer in the U.S. and are about to start using Zoho to manage the project only to find that it's blocked (it was working yesterday dammit!).<p>What kind of damage is this doing to China's startups?

Are there any initialization functions that need to be called before calling scrypt?<p>Yes, I can figure all this out by reverse engineering the code.  But is that really what you intend people to do?  Even just a couple of sentences of documentation would save a lot of people a lot of head-scratching, e.g.:<p>""The scrypt key generation function itself is called crypt_scrypt.  Its signature is in lib/crypto/crypto_script.h.  The reference implementation is in crypo_script-ref.h.  There are two optimized implementations, one for CPUs that have SSE support, and another for ones that don't.  You don't have to call any initialization functions before calling crypto_scrypt.""<p>Or something like that.

1349828,comment,1349566,1349786,0,0,SingAlong,,,"Well, I upvoted them back to normal :)<p>Anyway here's my list:<p>Even if you don't watch this movie called Any Given Sunday, you can find Al Pacino's 5-min inch-by-inch speech. That's the best I've seen. You can look it up on youtube. Worthy 5min :) It sort of dopes you with inspiration.<p>My favourites (may mostly include lesser known movies):<p>""The World's Fastest Indian"" (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412080/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412080/</a>) It's based on the real story of Burt Munro, an old hobby biker, from New Zealand who sets the world's fastest land speed record on his Indian motorcycle beating all odds like an unfit, aging body (with prostrate and a  ticking heart) and very little money to spare. It's not known that much. But Anthony Hopkins is good in that movie.<p>This movie is a bit different, there are no bad guys and it's really awesome to watch. Gives you a very different perspective of the world (""everybody is good"" sorta thing). It left me in tears after he breaks the world record in the end.<p>Others: Dead Poet's Society (""Carpe Diem - seize the day""), Walk The Line and a 1990 movie called Chaplin (for which Robert Downey won an Oscar for playing Charlie Chaplin) and ofcourse Forrest Gump (""life is like a box of chocolates you'll never know what you get"")<p>Also Mongol (Story of the rise of Gengiz Khan told from a different perspective). Some other language. But you'll get sub-titles.<p>And if you like Bollywood (Hindi) movies, try ""Lagaan"" and ""3 Idiots"" (this is a must watch).<p>After reading a lot abt Chariots of Fire, I'm going to watch it this weekend.<p>EDIT: if you like watching action cartoons, you should try watching Transformers - Cybertron series. Although gets a bit repetitive after a few episodes (loop: ""beat villian. he returns again""), the ""we are a team"" quote echoes thru-out.<p>P.S: If you notice closely in Forrest Gump, when Tom Hanks is narrating that his friend put his money in a fruit company and it seems like he's looking at a letter for shareholders, you'll notice that the letter contains Apple's old 'colorful apple' logo :D",1273929215

If you do this right (and park far away enough/walk enough), by the time you get to the venue you will be lit up and locked and loaded. Bear in mind, the first hello will suck. Maybe even the next five. Ok, the first twenty.<p>But if you can get to twenty one or thirty, the energy will shift from why am I doing this to I <i>love</i> doing this.<p>Part of this is because you are warmed up but more importantly you will start to get people responding to you. Gets you over your fear of rejection because you're just being a social guy or gal. As always, use your best judgement, but this technique is platinum. For bonus points, increase your range - target people across the street by putting your hand up and waving and ""HI!""<p>The abbreviated technique is to greet, pause, and shake hands and/or touch on upper arm with everyone once you enter a venue - immediately.

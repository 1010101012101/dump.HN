Also, note in Germany the company has another 30-40% cost on top of your bruto (they pay the other half of your pension and health insurance, for instance). Don&#x27;t look just at what you get, but at your overall cost for the company.<p>Past experience? After World War II public spending has been trending up everywhere (also in US, but more in Europe). What did we get in Europe? Slow growth, huge public debt, 3+ times the unemployment they have in USA, should I continue? The thing is: government is just really, really, bad in any kind of productive spending. Government should take care of the ones in need* and should make clear rules for everybody, that&#x27;s it, everything else is waste (and we have seen it).<p>*And let&#x27;s be clear here: this doesn&#x27;t mean public housing in the city center. This means giving enough to keep your dignity, which means you need to accept to leave far from the city.

Few countries can just scratch something and say ok that didn&#x27;t work lets try something else - because 10s of millions of people are already working in or dependent on said system. There are however a handful of countries in the world that can actually do this, because of the wealth and relatively small populations they have. Finland is one of those, so this is exiting.<p>The same problem exists in city planning. I&#x27;m sure civil engineers could design much more environmentally friendly and efficient cities, free of cars and with optimal transit, waste, and housing systems. But you always have an existing city where millions already live and work, and you have to have 20/30 year plans to get anything changed.<p>Its like trying to build a new piece of software but having to mold it out of a 20 year old monolithic legacy app where everything is interconnected and you have to maintain full backwards compatibility.",1440064289

I&#x27;m 23 years old this year.<p>You&#x27;re still young, don&#x27;t worry, the sun is still rising in your life, but don&#x27;t just sit back and watch it.<p>> Graduated last year from a top university in UK with a Bachelors(Hons) Chemical Engineering. Right after I graduated, I went back to my home country Malaysia. I always knew I wanted to start a startup.<p>Congratulations, with an engineering degree from a top UK university, apart from whatever you learned and whoever you met,  migration to other countries is easier for you.<p>> In fact, I did try to start a couple of startups -Tripadvisor-ish for students, Groupon clone and some small &#x27;projects&#x27; during the summers like trying to sell &quot;pure fruit juice&quot; during carnivals and stuff like that. None worked out.<p>You&#x27;ve failed several times early, that&#x27;s good, failure is a good teacher and failing is much harder when you have a spouse and two kids. The important thing is to know why you failed and learn what you should and shouldn&#x27;t do next time. Hopefully there were people to give you feedback. You also need to look at your ideas in a more fundamental and original way. The desire to solve a problem and a way to the solution should come first, not the startup. Describing startups as &quot;Tripadvisor for students&quot; , &quot;Hackernews for ballet dancers&quot; , &quot;Mixpanel for paper trails&quot; betrays a wrong mindset. An example of doing it the right way would be  &quot;I have an idea for a case that allows you to use electronics with magnetic storage in places that have strong passive magnetic fields, I should start a company to sell this to the several industries in my state&quot;<p>> Last year when I came back, tried to start an online grocery startup but within 2 months, I just knew it wasn&#x27;t feasible unless I had some decent funding or some sort.<p>Be glad you didn&#x27;t have enough money to spend to setup an online grocery.<p>> For the next 6 months, I literally just stayed in my room trying to come up with ideas, but none came up.<p>You should&#x27;ve expected that, isolating yourself in your room isn&#x27;t the place to come up with ideas. You need to go out, look at what people are doing, talk to them, do things, be busy, go to events. Maybe some people have the ability to generate ideas upon request, but for me, it happens when you&#x27;re not looking, like at a party, in the shower, when driving. You don&#x27;t &#x27;come up&#x27; with ideas, you &#x27;get&#x27; ideas.<p>> Ever since then, I’ve been trying to sell an animal feed called rumen bypass fat(dad’s idea), but no customers so far.<p>Did you study the market? Were animals hungry and farmers broke and was your feed cheaper and better?<p>> If you asked me what I really want in life, I’d say I want to make a difference on a large scale.<p>Why so grandiose? Anyway, a lot of people seem to want that. What you want in life shouldn&#x27;t be what you want in a startup. In life, I hope I become a good father, a good husband, spread joy, reduce suffering. I could do that if I made sure my neighbor never went hungry, or by solving world hunger - win, win.<p>> I’d like to start a startup that solves hard engineering/science problem.<p>Good, so find the problem and the startup will follow.<p>> The local startup scene is still playing catch up at the moment. The hot stuffs are ecommerce, on demand startups etc...<p>You gotta catch up before you can lead, so are you bold enough to get into the local startup scene and move it forward?<p>> Hence, I’m not particularly excited about joining the startups in the local scene and I would like to avoid joining big corporate companies.

However, the latter is not going away anytime soon, and as long as Objective-C code has to be written and maintained, there is a need to produce readable and succinct code.<p>During the past year, I&#x27;ve basically worked full time with Objective-C. Since I use the excellent ComponentKit (Objective-C++) to build app UIs, it wasn&#x27;t really practical to switch to Swift. So I was sitting there, stuck with Objective-C, and coming from a Smalltalk background, I couldn&#x27;t help but notice the influences it took on Objective-C. But I also couldn&#x27;t stop noticing where brilliant design decisions didn&#x27;t find
their way from Smalltalk to the Apple world.<p>That&#x27;s why I created OpinionatedC.<p>The thing I was missing the most was the super-immersive and highly-consistent Smalltalk collection API. In Smalltalk, most of the time it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference if you work with an Array, an OrderedCollection, a Set or even a String. In ObjectiveC, it does. That&#x27;s why the focus of OpinionatedC is clearly on collection extensions at the moment.<p>P.S.: I&#x27;m aware of many of the alternative libraries that offer a similar feature set, like Undersocre.m or ObjectiveSugar (or even ReactiveCocoa - which is great but a really big dependency if you just want the kind of extensions offered by OpinionatedC). However, none of those did really convince me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are great libraries, and badmouthing them is the last thing I want to do. But ultimately, I decided to build my own alternative anyway ;)",1440063970

If you would lose it when you start working, that&#x27;s just basically your standard welfare system. Basic income is by definition given to everyone without discrimination.<p>To compensate, you adjust tax levels. In my country you don&#x27;t pay tax the first few thousand dollars. You can remove that. Then you can increase the tax rate a bit, especially in the higher brackets. Then you end up with most people getting the same net income after taxes and basic income. And you get a smooth and bureaucracy-less progression from unemployment to full employment.<p>I agree with your comment on people not being good with money or budgets.

There are some potential massive wins on long term unemployment that come from eliminating incentive issues, some answers to the &quot;living wages&quot; and other positive rights problems. Less bureaucratic micromanaging of people&#x27;s lives. There&#x27;s a reason it hold attention on HN, it&#x27;s a real interesting idea. But…..<p>Basic income is the type of idea that is very, very hard to implement within our current (possibly any) political systems.  There is very little room for compromise, half measures and gradualism. It does not lend well to caveats exemptions, and design by committee.<p>One of the big selling points is that basic income is funded largely by <i>replacing</i> different welfare state institutions: unemployment benefits, child benefits, housing subsidies, state housing, pensions… This allows (A) A big enough basic income (B) big savings on welfare institutions running costs, (C) the simplicity needed for a clean re-write of incentives.<p>Where do the &quot;efficiency savings&quot; come from? Largely they come by cutting salaries associated with managing a welfare system. Can a government reduce public sector employment to that extent?<p>The danger for any country implementing this is that once they get into the political procee, they will chop and compromise and water down the idea until it is just another item on the big list of ingredient in the social welfare soup  €212.13 per month that you qualify for while keeping everything else that exists.<p>Reforming the tax system and the welfare system as radically as required in a short time is a tall order. Maybe the Finnish can pull it off. They have a good track record. More broadly, I expect that this would have a high failure rate.<p>The best chance (IMO) is for very a small country to try it first.",1440062731

I suffered from Lyme disease for about 2 1/2 years until it was diagnosed properly and treated, and in addition to the reduced income due to being unable to work at times, and the extra cost of healthcare (despite the insurance it&#x27;s not exactly free) in Austria, they still expect you to pre-pay taxes and pension & health insurance contributions based on your earnings 1-2 years ago. In theory you can claim some money for a few weeks if you get sick, but (a) you have to completely shut down any business activity for that time and (b) you have to be declared unable to work by a doctor. (Unlikely, considering the doctors were all telling me there was nothing wrong with me and it was &quot;stress&quot;…)<p>A basic income would at least help deal with the reduced income due to sickness & extra costs due to healthcare.

Nothing fancy there.<p>You could make it loads more efficient by putting the RTG at the focus of a parabolic reflector. Now all the photons are being emitted in a single direction, which means you get much more thrust.<p>According to this article:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_photonic_rocket"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_photonic_rocket</a><p>...a perfectly collimated photonic rocket runs at about 300MW/N.

Now the basic income, so basically we want the State to manage even more of the economy. If past experience would prove this effective, then OK, but it just proves the opposite!<p>Let me do some back of the envelope calculations for you. In Europe we pay around 40% of income tax. On top we pay at least another 8% for pension, which we will never see, and another 8-10% for health insurance, which is not great at all. On top of that, companies have another 30-40% of cost, _on top_ of the bruto salary of an employee in taxes and similar to pay to the state. Bottom line: more than half of your cost to the company goes to the government.<p>It&#x27;s just incredibly bad. If you have a 10% unemployment the most effective way to help people is to bring that down to, say, a 3%. That will help most definitely. But for that to happen you need to bring down the cost of labor, which is just too high.<p>And don&#x27;t let me start with pension. Europe is basically starving an entire generation, you don&#x27;t see it now, you will see in 30 years when the young of today will start to go into retirement age. There will be no money to pay a real pension to everybody. You know how much you need to have a very comfortable pension? At a 6% rate, about 500 euro a month for 40 years. That&#x27;s it, that&#x27;s all you need. Right now we are paying close to this amount for a public pension, will we see that money? Absolutely not.<p>Bottom line: they have to fix the economy. That&#x27;s the only long term solution and the only way to bring people out of unemployment and poverty.",1440061240

281145,comment,280889,281021,0,0,aardvarkious,,,"The thing is that lowering the drinking age doesn't dramatically raise the availability of alcohol for 18-year-olds. I know that when I was underage, I had no problem getting booze. And I work with teenagers now: they still don't have problems getting booze. What the higher drinking age does do is drive the drinking underground. So 18-year-olds have to drive more so that they can drink at bush parties. Or when a friend gets alcohol poisoning, they are afraid to get help.<p>Also, I would say that 80+% of people have their first drink before they legally can. This means that their parents usually have no clue they are drinking, and so they are less able to give their children guidance.",1219201121

281137,comment,281046,281116,0,0,smanek,,,"The main advantage that I see is that his class transparently works with any function expecting a 'sequence', which spec only defines as either a vector (i.e., 1-d array) or a list (i.e., linked list) while providing a some (extremely simple) lazy evaluation. I, for one, never realized that you could extend the sequence type in this way in SBCL.<p>For example, if he created an instance of his interval-sequence class with (below 100000000), he wouldn't actually have to allocate the memory for a hundred million element vector (or a 100 million cons cells). Instead, it would just use a handful of bytes to represent the start of the sequence, and the length.<p>By itself, it's fairly trivial. But, this sort of manipulation isn't part of the ansi spec so this post was just sort of letting us know what was possible (a 'hello world' of sorts).<p>I already have a few interesting ideas on how one could use this same technique to provide slightly smarter lazy evaluation, and some sort of time/duration manipulation stuff.",1219200563

But most of them will also make exceptions (and in writing) on a case-by-case basis once you prove you're a valuable employee. Because obviously you're not going to actually do anything on your own time if it's going to be your employer's property, whereas if you convince them that there's a potential for good PR with no real cost, they'll go for it.

(He segments the market across 2 axis (medium - store/mail/internet/kiosk & method - rent/buy/subscribe)<p>But given that environment, his arguments are reasonable. They want to focus on the big market - Physical Store. VOD  subscriptions, he sees as a small market indefinitely. VOD buy/rent he sees as a long term direction so.<p>The point about new releases sounded a little more along the lines of:<p>The new release market is more substantial. We have chosen to focus on those. We can, if needed support the long tail.<p>It's a bit cheap taking shots at everyone & anyone in an anachronistic business.

281116,comment,281046,281046,0,0,kylec,,,"From what I can tell, this provides two operations: interval and below. I'm not a Common Lisp user so I don't know the intricacies of CLOS but it seems to me that these functions can be written much more compactly, albeit without the extensive error reporting (in Scheme):<p><pre><code>    (define (interval a b)
      (if (<= b a) '()
          (cons a (interval (+ a 1) b))))

    (define (below x)
      (if (<= x 1) '(0)

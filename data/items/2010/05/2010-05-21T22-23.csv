Of course, the theory is that since we are all judging your writings by their merits it is just as good to get that information you just wrote from an anonymous source as it would be to get it from a source that has an identity.<p>To me that would matter, for one when someone is attaching their name - and by extension their reputation - to their words they automatically have something to lose by saying it.<p>Second, it helps to verify that they are real people with relevant experience, instead of posers.<p>Anonymity on the net has its uses, for instance for whistleblowers and to ask embarrassing questions.<p>But for the most part it is used as a shield for cowardly attacks, sockpuppets and to create a persona with a reputation that is larger than the one the person is really entitled to and so on.<p>Being yourself is more than enough.

1369205,comment,1367940,1369159,0,0,benmathes,,,"Fundamentally I think startups overvalue the risk of coming up with a product vision and undervalue the risk of executing on that vision. It's arguable harder and more risky to go from <i>""lets make a social network""</i> to the entire product that is Facebook, and a majority of the people that bridge that gap get <i>relatively</i> shafted on equity.<p>As to your point about joining a post-YC company, employees #1-#5 are generally defacto cofounders and are often given similar equity. I'm not disputing that. I'm talking more about (roughly) employees #6 -> #30. At that point you have a product vision, but no concrete product. <i>Since the major work of a startup is discovering the details of what to build, a majority of the work isn't done yet, and the real risk hasn't been mediated</i>. However, a majority of the equity has already been passed around.<p>The risk and reward are certainly correlated. To say for certain you'd need a rather complex economic analysis that factors in opportunity costs to really say what the monetary sweet-spot is on the founder<->enterprise-employee spectrum. My suspicion is that the startup talent market isn't very efficient; As an industry we haven't really found a good way to judge technical skill other than working alongside someone for months. This hurdle means all the good jobs come via social connections. All the good positions are taken by the founder's network, and all the great devs already have a good gig.",1274482223

These posts are not so harmful in themselves. The problem is that they are too easy to upvote.<p>But it often happens that HN gets stuck in a rut of some particular kind of stupid story for a bit.  This causes people who haven't been through one of these cycles to say that we've jumped the shark.  (This belief is such a constant we should considering making it the site's tagline.)  And then things return to normal.<p>It may happen that one day things never return to normal, of course, but based on experience so far I'm inclined to give these runs of bad stories time to run their course before worrying about them.<p>I have been gradually adding protections against fluff posts.

I thought it was commonly known and accepted that it was in large part German banks that were being bailed out when bailing out Greece. Similarly, as I understand it - and have long understood it, since perhaps 2005 or so (I'm Irish) - the property bubble in Ireland was driven by historically low interest rates - only easily possible with an influx of foreign capital denominated in Euro. Inflation in house pricing was so extreme that relying on it became an accepted way of becoming wealthy. Now, in Ireland, lots of people are pointing fingers, blaming politicians, banks, property developers, etc., but the real theft was by the property owning middle class themselves. When people wonder where the money of the boom went, they need only look to people who owned houses.<p>And another problem with house ownership - especially in English-speaking countries - is that it is seen as politically damaging to enact policies that cause house prices to fall, because it reduces the perceived wealth of the middle class. But this very same dynamic is what causes people to be upset, screaming that teachers and policepeople can no longer afford houses on their wages, ergo wages must rise, first time buyer tax rebates / etc. and other stupid policies that just serve to push up house prices even further.<p>It's all pretty depressing, and makes one despair somewhat of democracy.",1274481048

It’s not like there's anyone around who designed the language to complain to.<p>Anyway:<p>Reasons 1-5 aren't about the many languages used in China (if French & Spanish are different languages, then I consider Mandarin & Cantonese to be different languages). These difficulties are due to the lack of a concise phonetic alphabet (like the roman alphabet used in English, French, Spanish…, or the hiragana alphabet used in Japanese). If the Chineses languages all used a common (small!) phonetic alphabet of some sort, many of those difficulties would dissolve (and there is no particular reason why that could not be done, technically, except that it throws out a huge part of their culture). Even if only Mandarin existed, those first 5 difficulties would remain.<p>Edit: OK, so using a phonetic alphabet would mean that each language would be written differently... except that this is already true, essentially. You can actually write in Cantonese in a way that a Mandarin speaker could not understand (using the same characters), and there are those who do this. I think he says this in there (I read this a long time ago), that the Mandarin writing system is just that; Mandarin. The whole country knows how to read it (without necessarily knowing how to pronounce it), so it's more about the non-Mandarin-speaking Chinese people having 2 languages that they use: their own for speaking, and Mandarin for writing. Using a purely phonetic alphabet may make this bi-lingual usage more difficult... or not. The existing writing system is already pretty painful, whether you're a native or not (though natives have more time to get used to it before they're expected to be able to use it, I suppose).<p>Reason 6: this isn't like reading Shakespeare (Modern English, though an earlier version of it), as far as I understand. It seems more like trying to read The Canterbury Tales (Middle English) or Beowulf (Old English, more like German than English, really). You're completely correct about it not being relevant to practical usage of any of the Chinese languages, though.",1274480879

This can be done if they recognize the radical (<100 of them). For example you can tell if a word has something to do with the sea, even if you don't know it means ""anchor"".<p>* Writing system not phonetic: Any other European language than English would have formed a much better argument, since English is notorious for its haphazard mapping of mapping phonemes to the alphabet, partly caused by the fact that early printers in England were Dutch with bare knowledge of English.<p>One can argue that languages spread ""hardness"" in different aspects. Moser doesn't mention that Chinese grammar is trivial, to the point of nonexistent. Compare with, say, Greek grammar which has baffling complexity or Lithuanian that still has noun 9 cases! Some exotic native Indian languages have 10-15 noun classes (German has three, which we call gender).

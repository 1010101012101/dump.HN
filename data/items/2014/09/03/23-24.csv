Companies don&#x27;t like paying an experienced employee 2-3x in salary what they would have to pay a new hire to do the same tasks.

So the dominant incentive is for companies to produce crap and then market the hell out of it, or develop connections and feed off public credit (&quot;you may qualify for state assistance!&quot;)... almost anything except for producing stuff people actually need and trying to sell it on its virtues. And then there is the lack of money, because student budgets are often directed elsewhere, such as to their expensive but ineffective accreditation programs and university classes.<p>This transforms meaningful work in the education space into an uphill struggle against funded businesses with predatory business practices, and while word-of-mouth can benefit you over them in the long-run, the viral loop goes slower in education than in other areas and it is very, very difficult to build effective placement in commercial sales channels like search engines.<p>More direct connections between education and employment would help, but the connection is often weaker than one would think from the political rhetoric thrown around, especially considering that education is often a proxy term for &quot;credentials&quot; or &quot;signaling&quot; in public rather than knowledge.",1409788486

But the belief in Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy was even more powerful:<p><i>&quot;The medieval followers of Aristotle, first in the Islamic world and then in Christian Europe, tried to make sense of the lunar spots in Aristotelian terms. Various possibilities were entertained. It had been suggested already in Antiquity that the Moon was a perfect mirror and that its markings were reflections of earthly features, but this explanation was easily dismissed because the face of the Moon never changes as it moves about the Earth. Perhaps there were vapors between the Sun and the Moon, so that the images were actually contained in the Sun&#x27;s incident light and thus reflected to the Earth. The explanation that finally became standard was that there were variations of &quot;density&quot; in the Moon that caused this otherwise perfectly spherical body to appear the way it does. The perfection of the Moon, and therefore the heavens, was thus preserved.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/moon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/observations/moon.html</a>",1409788352

As far as I understand how the system works, GPS signal as received on the ground is 20dB below thermal noise. We can still find and amplify it because we know the seeds and algorithms of random number generators on the satellites. But if you were an alien that just came to Earth, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to find those transmissions.

QB completion is meaningless without incorporating distance.<p>I had a similar thought;  seems that he should bucket at least by remaining yards to get the first down as well as field position.  Imagine an 8-yard pass completion after a 1st and ten:  many teams will attempt a deep pass, hoping to pick up the first down with a short play in case of an incompletion.  That deep pass is a very different play and probably has a different completion likelihood.<p>Likewise, consider passes from your own 20 vs their 20 (that is, 80 yards of field left before the end zone vs 20):  my intuition says that the latter pass has lower likelihood of completion, because the field is shorter and the defenders have less ground to cover.<p>So, it might actually be that &quot;rhythm&quot; exists, but only in long field positions or only on long drives.",1409787475

SpaceX and Tesla were not economically viable concepts at the beginning.<p>The thought I wanted to express is that our economic system is an optimization process that shapes (and is shaped by, in a feedback loop) the progress of technology. It&#x27;s the economy that decided we won&#x27;t be having moon bases or jetpacks anytime soon, even though we could. It&#x27;s the force that decides that a random photosharing app is worth more than feeding the poor or curing cancer.<p>Current economy as an optimization process was aligned with human values pretty well so far (though not perfectly; government regulations are one of the tools we use to try and fix that alignment). But as a greedy process (in the CS sense of the word), it often gets stuck in local optimas. That&#x27;s where Elons, Brins, etc. come in - they have enough cash and vision to <i>force us</i> out of the local optimum and help find a better one.",1409785423

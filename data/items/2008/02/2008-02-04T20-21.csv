109293,comment,108861,109157,0,0,jimbokun,,,"""Surely neural interfaces can render most coding obsolete eventually.""<p>I am skeptical of that.  I think that a good programming language can be a great help for making ideas precise and exploring their ramifications.  We may have some vague notion of what seems a great idea, but when we go to express it in a precise way find out that there are significant obstacles that were not at first evident.  So, the read-eval-print-loop of a good ""exploratory"" language might still be very useful, even in a world with neural-computer interfaces.",1202158667

You may learn the facts faster, and keep motivation up.<p>But to learn beyond the basics, especially areas that are less likely to be covered at your local community college, you should learn how to learn from a book (this <i>is</i> different than learning from books in other subjects).<p>Perhaps, if you take some lectures, you may want to read a chapter or two ahead of the lecture, to get used to reading a math book as a primary source.<p>Good luck!  Math is beautiful!",1202158604

109289,comment,109052,109248,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Trying to keep this non-partisan, it seems that big pieces of the base of each party came out with their own guy this time around. There was Huckabee for the evangelicals, Paul for the A/W Libertarians, and Obama for the black vote. I guess you could even count Clinton with the feminists. In the past, each of these goups were considered the bedrock of their parties. The primary was so open that each group had their own guy, but in general it didn't seem to matter much. Machines beat bases.<p>You are right that there is a huge difference between the way a politician runs and the way he governs. That's probably a good thing. I think with emotions so high over various issues people are going to be dissapointed when they don't get the simple answer they wanted, no matter who they choose.",1202158368

109286,story,,,1,4,DanielBMarkham,"Powerful Programming Languages, Take Two",,"So let's say it's 50 years into the future. You and your startup team get together for a weekend to crank out the next killer app. (Surely you haven't given up startups by now, have you?)<p>You all put on your neural helmets and begin to have a conversation about where the users are, what strategies you'd like to use, and the types of things you'd like to do in the future. At the end of this discussion, the computer creates a 10-minute neural ""video"" of your agreement along with a working application. Any newcomer to the team can ""watch"" the neural video and not only understand the application, but also understand what decisions were made and why, and how things should change in the future. The working application consists of 40K lines of assembly, automatically created during the discussion. To change the program, you just need to repeat the discussion process you did to create it -- ie, no assembler language knowledge is needed. Of course you _could_ go in and hack the assembler if you chose.<p>Conversely, at the same time, Arc++, The Next Generation is out. For this same amount of work, the code needed is this:<p>Floog()<p>Which of these is the more powerful programming language? Why?",1202157973

109272,comment,109100,109100,0,0,TheTarquin,,,"While it does bear some consideration I think that some of the first acts of aggression in both world wars were attacks against underwater telegraph cabling, I'd be a little hesitant to jump to conclusions too quickly.  There are a number of reasons why and how suchs cables could be taken offline.  Sosuke mentioned one in particular: power issues.  One of the first transatlantic telegraph cables was fried when the first operators, thinking it would take tons of power to ""push"" a signal all the way across the Atlantic, fried the cable and much of the equipment on the far end.  While these aren't telegraph cables, the principle is the same.  They may well have been taken offline because of recurrent power issues at one end or the other.<p>Then again this maybe a prelude to another country in the Middle East getting pummeled.  IMO, it's hard to say at this point.",1202155877

Otherwise writing in batches like you suggest could work too.<p>After looking at your post again, and depending on data volume, you might be ok with a purely SQL solution too (ie, finding nodes 1 or 2 steps away on a graph is easy in SQL if your adjacency data is all in the db).",1202155728

One book that was incredible and disturbing was a small paperback - giving a layman's guide to Godel's Proof (maybe by Nagel&Newman?). The topic is too abstract to ever apply to a real world problem. But it is so profound that it is hard to imagine going through life not knowing it.",1202155554

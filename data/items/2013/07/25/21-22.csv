6105265,comment,6098620,6104768,2,0,Groxx,,,"&quot;What <i>Made</i> Lisp Different&quot; - all true.  All intended as past tense.  I never see claims that Lisp is unique because it has GC, for instance.<p>Looking at the &#x27;setf&#x27; macro, since you have to use &#x27;defsetf&#x27;, I don&#x27;t see the difference between that and something in Ruby where you could do (errors aside):<p><pre><code>  class Object\n    def defsetf(name)\n      $setf[self.class] = name\n    end\n  end\n  def setf(class, *args)\n    class.send($setf[class], *args)\n  end\n  class Whatever\n    defsetf :set_something\n    def set_something; end\n  end\n  \n  # elsewhere...\n  setf Whatever, instance, value\n</code></pre>\nAdding arbitrarily-complex ways to let you specify how to transform the arguments to a call is as easy as accepting a lambda instead of a symbol, recursive setf-ing[1] is just a lookup on the arguments and then nesting lambdas.  I might be missing some deeper realization here though - defsetf seems pretty simple.  Certainly the <i>use</i> could be complex, but I see nothing that implies that its <i>implementation</i> is unachievable, even with nearly-identical syntax, so what remains is library support and community.  Again - specialization, not unique attribute of the language.<p>As to &quot;data-as-code&quot;, I think you mean the other way around?  If not, eval.  If yes, Ruby&#x27;s reflection is I think insufficient without heavy modification like e.g. running a ruby interpreter in ruby to read its own source code and &quot;reflect&quot; with the AST that generates (though this is possible[2]).  This is one spot where Lisp-likes certainly <i>excel</i> to a degree few outsiders achieve, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve seen outsiders, they&#x27;re just not as fluent or efficient at running it.  But few outsiders have real interest in optimizing it, or people label them as yet another Lisp-like, making the point sort of moot since it&#x27;s part of the definition of being Lisp-like (to many).<p>--<p>Macros in particular come up often, but I don&#x27;t see anything really interesting about them.  If you have the full AST available (a rarity, I&#x27;ll admit), then it seems like a strict subset of runtime modification - it&#x27;s just a self-eliminating runtime modification, done ahead of time for speed purposes.  Except for maybe C-style macros, which (via a horrible syntax) can generate <i>anything</i>, not just valid code, which isn&#x27;t always possible.<p>[1]: (setf (sqrt something) number) => (set-sqrt something number) => (setf something (* number number)) in here: <a href=""http://lists.warhead.org.uk/pipermail/iwe/2005-July/000130.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.warhead.org.uk/pipermail/iwe/2005-July/000130.h...</a> found via here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267862/what-makes-lisp-macros-so-special"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267862/what-makes-lisp-ma...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/1108988"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/1108988</a>",1374789510

The article just said they wanted to see if they can do it. Namely, to create a negative, fake memory.<p><i>it&#x27;s the best tool we have. Once we get a better tool we&#x27;ll use it</i><p>Tool for what, exactly? We <i>know</i> the brain is made up of stuff and that it can be influenced. The question is rather, what of that is even desirable to do. In the article I just see the fascination of playing God, there not even pie in the sky medical applications are mentioned. And personally, I can&#x27;t think of any. I tried!<p>Let&#x27;s say someone was sexually abused by red haired people as a kid. That is, they only knew two red haired people, those abused them, and now they have a very strong negative reaction to red haired people. Wouldn&#x27;t it <i>always</i> be more desirable for them to talk about this stuff and work through it, than just their association with red hair being &quot;reset&quot;? [I&#x27;m simply assuming that if you can make benign memory bad, it&#x27;s only a matter of time until we try making a bad memory benign, or even good] Okay, maybe it should be their choice, I can&#x27;t tell others what they need to be able to cope with. And my example is very bad, I just couldn&#x27;t think of a better one; though I am still keen to hear others, let&#x27;s simply assume there is a really good example, and a great medical use for good.. where there&#x27;s not so much faking going on, but correcting actual mistakes etc. where intellectually realizing them just doesn&#x27;t cut it for some reason.<p>As I said, I can&#x27;t really tell others what they should do or not do, especially since I am not suffering from any crippling anxieties or brain damage. I have only one argument why they should rather go the harder road, which may big payoffs in the way of personal growth, but also may simply not work at all: just like you supposedly can&#x27;t hypnotize people to do things that goes completely against their moral values, I think it&#x27;s harder to make someone believe the dog that bit them actually licked their hand with just a bunch of conversations. Yes, people can be brainwashed already, and I guess a bad but trusted therapist could also do a lot of damage; but compared to physically reaching in there and re-arranging things, it&#x27;s still like muskets to the nuclear bomb. And wether stuff like &quot;Bush Derangement Syndrome&quot; is a real thing, or just a dumb ad-hominem, is actually simply a consensus decision. Medical history, and that of the mind especially, is FULL of people being mis-diagnosed and made to fit. The world has been reeling with power grabs and raising awareness of them for many decades, so to invent such a &quot;tool&quot;, even the most simplicistic beginnings of it, &quot;just because&quot;, seems just nucking futs to me. That it&#x27;s &quot;exciting&quot; to the &quot;global neuroscience community&quot; doesn&#x27;t really cut it for me to get excited, too.<p>&quot;<i>If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable  what then?</i>&quot; -- George Orwell<p>^ You see, there is only one way to find out, and no way back from it.

My hunch is that that the existing open source systems out there that do the crowdfunding thing would suffice. Catarse[1] is one I can think of off the top of my head. I looked into using it for Watsi but decided it wasn&#x27;t going to work. My point is is that there is already software out there like ours. The fact that someone could use ours as a base is nice, but not motivation enough to open it up. Are crowdfunding platforms going to become the new CMS? It might already be happening.<p>> A sort of &quot;in-kind&quot; donation of their time and energy and expertise, right?<p>Yes, and we are already leveraging that, just selectively. Everything takes time, especially managing open source software. Even though the tools have gotten much better (does anybody remember what life was like before Githug, et al?) it doesn&#x27;t mean the cost of managing the contributions have gone down to zero. We want to leverage energy where we can, but in a way that works for us.

We shouldn&#x27;t be so cavalier when we are dealing with the foundations of life.  We don&#x27;t fully understand the genome and we require food to eat.

I&#x27;m not untar&#x27;ing things every day.<p>Now multiply that example across all sorts of commands.

Aliases are defined once and cast in stone - if there is a variable in an alias body, it will be evaluated once, on alias creation, and never again. Functions have no such problem. They also let you select process arguments, while aliases delegate this to invoked commands. Aliases are for very simple things, anything more complicated and you should write a function.<p>Also, you should set up a decent autocompletion. Zsh needs a bit of configuring and fish has it by default - the need for most aliases is eliminated by autocompletion and history functionalities of a shell. There is standard CTRL+R combo which lets you search your history and there is a &quot;up-line-and-search&quot; action in zsh which searches the history for lines starting with what you have on your current line. Set your HISTSIZE to some huge number and never worry about forgetting how to do something or having to repeat (as in re-type) a command.<p>Use fasd (<a href=""https://github.com/clvv/fasd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clvv/fasd</a>). A simple little script that records all paths, files and directories, you visit and sorts them by &quot;frecency&quot; (both frequency and recency).

There are often more reports than there are resources for the police to respond to. Additionally, if I report something that is obviously frivolous or not illegal, they don&#x27;t have to investigate. For example: I report to your local PD that you have harassed me with this comment online. It&#x27;s obviously baseless and frivolous, and they shouldn&#x27;t spend any time &quot;warning you that it <i>might</i> be illegal&quot;.<p>> &quot;they should probably investigate and determine if a crime actually happened&quot;<p>Sure, when the police report is made by the harassed party, they should ask the form that the harassment took place as. When the response is &quot;reviews on Yelp&quot;, the police should be smart enough to know that it isn&#x27;t harassment. It <i>could</i> still be libel or defamation, but neither of those are criminal activities, and shouldn&#x27;t be pursued by the police. There is no need for any investigation that goes beyond the report and maybe looking at the source of the reviews.<p>> &quot;I guess don&#x27;t really see the problem with the phone call from the police either&quot;<p>First of all, I think the officer had good and understandable intentions. I don&#x27;t think she was overtly threatening or malicious. She <i>was</i> just trying to diffuse a situation. Unfortunately, she was doing so by strongly urging a citizen to stop expressing their rights under 1A.<p>From one POV it&#x27;s a helpful police officer trying to defuse a situation; from another POV it&#x27;s an official agent of the government telling the citizen that they should stop doing an activity that they have every right to. An officer of the law telling you what you&#x27;re doing is borderline criminal <i>when it&#x27;s not</i> is going to have a significant chilling effect on speech.<p>I think this is expressed in quotes from the officer such as:<p>* &quot;is there any reason you posted those photos?&quot;<p>* &quot;If there is a violation and you want to show it to someone ... If they feel like there&#x27;s no violation then you should probably drop it&quot;<p>* &quot;You put your opinion out there once, twice, I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re hoping to gain&quot;<p>* &quot;You&#x27;re borderline criminal / civil harassment there&quot; (this isn&#x27;t true. It could be a violation of Yelp&#x27;s TOS, or it could be defamation, but it wouldn&#x27;t be harassment. Unless they prosecute the violation of Yelp&#x27;s TOS under the CFAA there is <i>no</i> criminal behavior implied in his actions)<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think the officer&#x27;s intent was bad. I also don&#x27;t think this was as big a deal as the article made it out to be. However, like I said, it seems perfectly reasonable to secure pro-bono counsel for the guy.

Linux becomes much more enjoyable when you can type `untar <file>` instead of remembering the magical incantation `sudo tar -xzvf <file>`. Make aliases for everything. nginx-reload. nginx-restart. alias z=&quot;vim ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc&quot;. I even abstract apt-get commands into ag-install, ag-update, ag-remote, etc.<p>One problem with this is you become a cripple when you have to use an outside machine or need to write a script for wide distribution.",1374786151

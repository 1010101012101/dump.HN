They're a model company, but in a 1.5 player market (Google being one player, Yahoo being .3 of a player and Microsoft being .2 of a player), you just can't allow the top two to collude together.  Unless the partnership is merely giving Yahoo a fork of PageRank, it's going to be crappy - and it isn't that.",1213297055

216173,comment,215828,216152,0,0,brianlash,,,"It's been my take that ""startup"" connotes something entrepreneurial, where ""new business"" (or ""small business"") connotes the start of something that's been done before.<p>That's a meaningful distinction to make because it involves different skills, a different assumption of risk, and a different level of tenacity needed to be successful in one or the other.<p>So startup = selling something different.  It's about pitching people your idea, and positioning a product creatively in the market.  New business is about being seen (e.g. consider starting a franchise pizza shop and advertising on local TV/in print).  It's ""new"" because people didn't know it was there before.  But it's not ""startup"" for lack of its differentiation along the lines of <i>how</i> that something is sold.<p>I like this defition because it permits that a new company that sells the same old product (e.g. Threadless and their tees) may be called a startup for its ability to creatively position their products.<p>Exactly when a company transitions from ""startup"" to ""going conern"" is another question.",1213296713

A degree from Harvard Business School would put her in a much better position for a high-growth starting job at a large company.  Big difference.  As much as this place likes to avoid the reality, the fact is that most businesses eventually need pure business types to efficiently run the company.  They may not be involved in strategic planning, product development, etc. (although many are) but you need those operations people to keep the wheels turning efficiently.",1213296455

We've seen the Silicon Valley darlings move from month to month... Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, for example, and I can find examples at each stage. If it did end up being too negative, my apologies. That's what I get for keeping it as brief as I did.

But they have also been in other businesses, and I would say that you could consider them like a private equity firm. They would buy companies of good value and build them out. They did it with furniture retail.<p>There is a difference between speculating and investing. Speculating is zero sum and about 80% of the people that trade will lose money.<p>Buffet actually says that diversification is a good idea if you don't know what you're doing. If you can value companies properly then you can have returns greater than the market (beta-weighted).<p>Investing is not zero sum. I'm not going to defend that, it just is. That being said, buy and hold is a dumb idea too. And equities historically beat inflation if you consider dividend payouts.",1213295447

Personally I've written code for the iphone and android. I'd avoid any of the older phones that don't provide some sort of API. Your initial users presumably will be techies with newer phones.

I've had other friends stay home longer than I did because their goals did not bring them the financial benefits of others and it took longer to become self-sufficient.

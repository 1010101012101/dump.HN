4492067,comment,4488682,4490726,2,0,utopkara,,,"""stick around ... to conduct usability tests, user research, and user feedback"" is exactly the pitfall that UX falls into when it fails. We've seen it happen so many times, and en masse. This process-driven design fails, because it tries to put the designer in the middle of development, while taking away the responsibility for good design. It is attractive, because the UX designer can blame the users' ""unexpected"" behavior. It is attractive, because it exchanges the experience, with experiment. If the design is incomplete, it is incomplete, period. If the users have to be observed, let it be done, the development can wait. There is nothing worse than a designer who makes blind guesses about the design hoping that some miracle during the ""usability test"" will reveal a beautiful solution.",1347072437

4492048,comment,4490591,4490591,8,0,robomartin,,,"Manufacturing is far more complex than most people imagine.  I laugh when I see commercials showing craftsmen lovingly making YOUR mattress or some such thing when you know damn well that it looks much uglier and far less custom/manual in reality.<p>Take the task of manufacturing and bringing to market an electronic product.  Here's an incomplete list of some of the tasks requiring attention:<p><pre><code>  - Schematic design\n  - Mechanical design\n    - Plastics\n    - Machined metal\n    - Sheet metal\n    - Wire harnesses\n    - Optics (for lights, light pipes, etc.)\n    - Label, decal or printing design (legends, etc.)\n    - DFM (Design for Manufacturing\n  - Component sourcing\n    - Staging according to lead times\n    - Strategy to ensure long-term availability\n    - Testing methodologies\n  - PCB Layout\n  - Electronic Assembly\n    - Surface mount\n    - Through hole\n    - Manual soldering\n    - X-ray inspection\n    - Automated optical inspection\n    - Device Programming\n    - Testing\n  - Packaging\n    - Packaging design\n    - Cardboard\n    - Foam\n      - Injection molded\n      - Cut and glued\n    - Box\n    - Labels\n    - International variants\n  - Regulatory testing\n    - CE\n    - TUV\n    - FCC\n    - UL\n    - Other countries\n  - Mechanical manufacturing\n    - Injection molded plastics\n    - Machining\n    - Sheet metal\n    - Stamped metal\n    - Mold making\n    - Jigs and fixtures\n  - Software development\n    - Embedded\n    - FPGA\n    - Workstation\n  - Documentation\n    - Manuals\n    - Website\n    - Brochures\n  - Support\n    - Develop testing and methodologies\n    - Support scripts\n    - Support systems\n  - And more...\n</code></pre>\nThe list is not complete of course, but it provides some idea of how complex it can be.  The idea of reducing this to an API or solving it via 3D printing is nice, but, today, a fantasy.<p>There are issues that are not obvious from simply reading this list.  For example, entrenched systems and software that does not inter-operate.  Disciplines that require massively different infrastructures (machine shop, plastic molding, packaging, PDB assembly, wire harness fabrication) and are sometimes islands in and of themselves.<p>Just looking at CNC machining is an example of how arcane things can be and how difficult it can be to change the way things work.  CNC machine manufacturers use G-code (which is older than dirt).  You'd think that by now this would be a smooth system.  It isn't.  Software vendors produce tools that require customization for each machine type and, even then, can produce g-code that is actually dangerous to run.<p>I had exactly this experience when I decided that we needed to have our own CNC machining in-house.  We bought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of (mostly) Haas equipment.  All g-code was generated with a CAM tool that ran inside of Solidworks.  I'll fast forward to the day that one of the machines --with a 20 Horsepower spindle-- happily churned aluminum with a one inch roughing bit like it was butter.  It was amazing to watch, and it sounded horrible.  The CAM program simply put out the wrong instructions because the engineers who created it in India decided to have their own creative interpretation of how G-code should work.<p>Anyhow, the point is that manufacturing is hard and complex.  That's why you don't see Y-Combinator style ""Here's $15K, go start a company"" incubators doing real hardware.  In the hardware world, outside of the trivial, $15K won't even cover the tooling.<p>Maybe in a few hundred years we'll have Star Trek style replicators.  How cool would that be.",1347071827

If you don't really care much about what you're licensing,  the license doesn't really matter.  Probably 99% of programs fit this category.  With ""99%"" of programs, no one gets wealthy, no one gets sued, the license has no real impact on anything, life goes on as if there had never been a license.  And in most cases no one even reads these licenses. Hence things like the ""shareware"" license, the ""beerware"", the ""dowhatthefuckyouwantto"" license, the GPL, ""Copyleft"", ""Ty Coon"", and so on.  These are mocking the entire practice of licensing.  There's a reason for that.<p>And for many years even the ones who do care about licensing, e.g. Microsoft, would have licenses that contained unenforceable terms. But how many Windows users cared about reading a license?<p>If you really cared about licensing your software (e.g. you thought someone might get wealthy from the software, or someone might get sued), then you'd spend a few bucks to have a lawyer draft a license for you, specifically.<p>And if users really cared about the licenses they were agreeing to, they'd probably complain.  Because some of the licenses, the terms they contain, are beyond unreasonable.  They are so one-sided as to be unenforceable.<p>It's amusing how programmers who post comments on the web are so tuned in to licenses, but in reality they spend little effort/money when it comes to licensing.  And that's OK, because with ""99%"" of software programs, it does not matter.  It's irrelevant.  No one gets wealthy, no one gets injured, no one sues.  It's neither here nor there.  Some cut and pasted text that no one reads is good enough.<p>But licenses do make a great subject for programmer chatter on the web.

Most of the manufacturers that you will recognize from a consumer standpoint are the former, but most of the ones that I've worked for and toured in the local area are the latter. Many automation systems are not cost effective for high product mix mfgrs.<p>- There is a ton of software used in manufacturing - not just at the ERP/MRP level, but all the way down to the production floor. Some of it is COTS, but much of it is custom.<p>- 3D Printing may be buzz worthy, but I don't think it's applicable to most manufacturing operations. Wherever you are while reading this, look around you and count the number of things that could have been made with a 3D printer, and then ask yourself whether 3D printing cycle times (and therefore cost) would scale to large operations.<p>- ""API's for Manufacturing"" sounds a bit nebulous. When you run a manufacturing operation, there are 4 main drivers for improvement: quality, cost, delivery, and inventory. If you have a single factory producing good on demand via an API, it sounds like a job shop, and would have a limited range of capabilities. If the API interfaced with a network of manufacturing operations, each with its own specialty, then those 4 drivers become significant hurdles.",1347070639

You'll get real numbers for both to as much precision as your equipment allows.  And I assumed that this was the definition of position and momentum -- the instantaneous values you get for the two measurements <i>are defined to be</i> the particle's position and momentum at time t.  So I didn't understand why everyone was saying you can't find both simultaneously -- from my definition, of course you can find them both!<p>But from the definition you've given me, I am guessing most other people define position and momentum as consistent quantities, meaning they have to have the same values upon each new measurement of the system in order to be called ""position"" or ""momentum"".

If so, that makes a lot of sense.<p>But I would think textbooks would clarify that more, because there are a lot of people who, like me, get confused by this type of wording.

I've heard from others that this is also the case in many of the other south american countries.<p>But I don't think we need to find people local.  I believe in telecommuting, and I think that talented people want to live in nice places.  For instance, I know one american company that has several employees in Thailand and asia, simply because that's where the employees want to live.<p>I think letting people telecommute will be a competitive advantage for us in hiring.  The office is such a mind numbing place to work, they seem designed to kill productivity. (we don't have an office, the founders share an apartment, having a larger apartment is still cheaper than having a separate office.)<p>But we're also working on businesses with a great degree of leverage.  I think many businesses see themselves as mostly selling the product of their employees productivity, and thus more employees=more business.  We're selling the product of ingenuity... and so a lot of places where other people would hire employees, we will outsource.  For instance, when we can't do support in house, we'll have an employee or two who is in charge of customer service, but the primary front line customer service people would be employees of a customer-service-as-a-service provider.",1347070113

It would be very difficult to hold a smile for that long, and especially in those early photography days when the smiling-for-pictures convention still hasn't been established.",1347070098

Much larger than anything approaching the scale of individual molecules.<p>Sound recordings on vinly are similarly limited by other factors.  To ""read"" the signal from a record groove a needle is dragged a needle through a v shaped groove.  This needle jiggles up and down and left and right, hence the two channels in stereo.  The time resolution of the signal (max frequency) is limited by the physics of the jiggling head.  It's inertia prevents it from reading signals over a certain limiting frequency.

My answer is a good way to do it.<p>2) Re: my direct experience...<p>If you're talking about writing C, that's not true.  But it has been a while because, frankly, I'd rather not torture myself. If you're talking about embedded programming, you're right, I haven't touched it.<p>If you're talking about applications where performance is very important, I've been dealing with quite a bit of HPC type stuff over the last year or so.  In general, the hardcore C/C++/Fortran guys are becoming less useful, for reasons I stated in my OP. Notice I'm not saying ""useless"", I'm saying ""less useful"". There are absolutely applications in which this just isn't possible, so use what works. But applications where C is your only choice are becoming rarer and rarer.<p>And while we're here, where exactly did I say that the linux kernel should be rewritten in some other language? I didn't.

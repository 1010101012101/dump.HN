Many editors have that feature, either built-in or via plugins, but it&#x27;s definitely an area where IDEs shine. If the editor/IDE has a way to infer scope, you get good completion, if not, you get mediocre completion.<p>But &quot;snippet expansion&quot; or &quot;templates&quot; as they are called in some IDEs is <i>very</i> easy and doesn&#x27;t require statical analysis or whatever.",1382083144

6570243,comment,6570026,6570026,1,0,lchitnis,,,"Hi there, I&#x27;ve been meditating on and off since I was 15 (I&#x27;m now 34). When I was younger I meditated very regularly, and now I try to get in 20 minutes about 3-4 times a week. I&#x27;ve noticed that when I meditate, the next day goes a lot better, in terms of mental clarity, peace, productivity, emotional stability, and the ability to grasp the subtleties of my own intuition. I longed for a guru when I was a teen, and by the age of 21, I found him, or rather, he found me. I followed him to his Himalayan ashram and had many wonderful spiritual experiences there, which were more than merely coincidental. I&#x27;m a healthy skeptic so of course nothing mattered to me more than the direct perception of the truths they talk about in meditation. I have experienced a few of these over the years, but they are difficult to attain and the toughest thing is that in order to experience them, you cannot want them. These experiences sort of play &#x27;hard to get&#x27; - it&#x27;s hard to explain, but I think the Universe designed it that way so we aren&#x27;t attached to such experiences and we don&#x27;t hanker after them -- to Hindus, that desire destroys the purpose of meditation, which &quot;should&quot; be done for its own sake.<p>I am currently reading Transcendence by Dr. Norman E. Rosenthal and wish to get involved with a TM practice once I am situated in the bay area. As with anything, meditation is a practice and I&#x27;ve found that only when I sustain it, do I experience sustained benefits.<p>My adi guru, or first guru, was my father, and he gave me my first mantra, which I repeated for 7 years. After that, I took initiation from my guru; however, I still repeat the mantra that my father gave me. Now I can get into a meditative state rather quickly without using the tool of mantra to get there, but some days it&#x27;s still a struggle.<p>I wish you well on your journey, which is 100% inward with meditation!

The reform mentioned in the article has a very bad reputation here and most experts, citizens and politicians would like to take back the changes. Education standards declined rapidly as it become more egalitarian.

6570211,comment,6569792,6569792,3,0,zmk_,,,"Having grown in Poland, I have to say I was very lucky to be born in 1985 which was the cut-off year for the reformed educational system. I managed to escape it. It is widely agreed that the system brought nothing but deterioration in the level of education students receive pre-univeristy, esp. in maths/physics/chemistry. So much so that when I was still studying in Poland, I often heard that &quot;new&quot; students are at a level comparable to &quot;old&quot; part-time students.<p>> He decided to keep all Polish children in the same schools until they were 16, delaying the moment when some would have entered vocational tracks.<p>This is misleading.  First of all, education is obligatory until one is 18 years old in Poland. There is no such thing as dropping out of school before that age.
The previous educational system was two-tier, with primary school lasting until 15 years old, and high school lasting the remainder 4 years (5 years for vocational high school, AFAIR). There were no electives in primary school, so the first real sorting of students based on ability was taking place at entrance exams to high schools (which had no obligation to accept a student based on their geographical location). What the reform implemented is it created a third tier in between primary (shortened by 2 years) and high schools (shortened by 1 year), the gymnasium. Gymnasiums do not have the sorting ability of high schools. With the end result being that what high schools were previously struggling to teach in 4 years now they have to condense into 3 years. So a lot of things are left out now. Plus the students they get at entry are also of lower quality -- I remember browsing through the first set of chemistry textbooks for gymnasium and being shocked that what the &quot;old&quot; system primary school students had to cover in two years was supposed to be covered in a lesser form in 3 years of gymnasium. So yes, the reform postponed the division of students into university/vocational tracks by one year, but at the cost of overall quality of education.",1382081045

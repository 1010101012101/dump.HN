6190631,comment,6188102,6188676,3,0,yrro,,,"You would configure your email server to reject the two following cases:<p>Case 1: SMTP client that knows nothing about TLS<p><pre><code>  S: 220 server.example ESMTP Greetings!
  C: HELO host.example
  S: 550 TLS only, thanks!
</code></pre>
Case 2: ESMTP client that knows nothing about TLS<p><pre><code>  S: 220 server.example ESMTP Greetings!
  C: EHLO host.example
  S: 250-STARTTLS
  C: MAIL FROM: user@host.example
  S: 550 TLS only, thanks!
</code></pre>
Sadly, a client that refuses to attempt TLS negotiation will always leak the sender address of the message it wants to send you. This happens in many protocols when TLS is bolted on as an afterthought. We&#x27;re actually worse off using the standardized TLS extension to SMTP here than we are with the non-standardized SSL: a connection to port 465, followed by immediate SSL negotiation won&#x27;t leak anything to a passive eavesdropper.<p>This only gets you so far however. An active attacker can MITM the connection with ease, since there is no convention for how to verify an SMTP peer&#x27;s certificate. I don&#x27;t see this changing until DNSSEC is deployed in every domain you correspond with, and the peer&#x27;s certificate is somehow authenticated with information from their DNS zone.<p>Aside: for a protocol that is designed even worse than SMTP with regards to leaking information over insecure channels, look at IMAP:<p><pre><code>  S: * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE STARTTLS LOGINDISABLED] Dovecot ready.
  C: 0 login user@example hunter12
  S: BAD [ALERT] Plaintext authentication not allowed without SSL/TLS, but your client did it anyway. If anyone was listening, the password was exposed.
  S: 0 NO [PRIVACYREQUIRED] Plaintext authentication disallowed on non-secure (SSL/TLS) connections.
</code></pre>
The stupid protocol design results in the client transmitting the user&#x27;s credentials in plain text as soon as it connects to the server.",1376131032

My main browser hasn&#x27;t had flash in that long or longer and I haven&#x27;t missed anything.<p>Most video sites revert to html5 video. You are also telling developers who track their flash install base to update their site to be compatible by voting against flash with your browser.<p>More important, i&#x27;ve been disabling flash on the computers of non-tech friends and they don&#x27;t seem to notice it either.<p>If you need Java for banking, setup a second or third browser where you only access that site, and by only entering in the URL directly.",1376129622

Plan 9 is a creature that was designed well from day one, but initially limited by restrictive licensing.

That is why I make all my businesses financial numbers public, too.

To draw conclusions out of them.  The conclusion you draw out of a downward-sloping sales graph is not ""Things are looking up!""  The long-term strategy, which is laid out in the blog post, is to repeat the tactics (advertising) that failed before, seemingly without regards to understanding why they failed the first time.<p>(Which is fairly simple: it is virtually impossible to achieve a conversion ratio high enough to justify that price point with a ten-cent ad.  You need to either charge much more or have a back end revenue stream.  The App Store is not conducive to either.  I pay six cents a click and sell an app for $25 and it takes significant work to make money and those numbers.)<p><i>He's in a much, much, much better position than half the gumball developers on the store now.</i><p>I agree with this assessment, which should be tattooed to the inner eyelids of anyone thinking of publishing for the store.",1229052448

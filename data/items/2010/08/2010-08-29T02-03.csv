1642996,comment,1641759,1642078,0,0,Vivtek,,,"If you're an individual, the same law applies if you count it as a business expense.  The usual disclaimers apply: I'm not a lawyer or an accountant, I'm just a sole proprietor.  There's no legal distinction between being a sole proprietor with a daytime job and one without - income from your sole proprietor activity is taxed on Schedule SE for self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare) and Schedule C for income tax from a business - and that's where this applies.<p>The ""I'm not really a business"" rule is really, really not one the IRS believes in.",1283050685
1642995,comment,1642309,1642470,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, it's one thing if they don't want to pay say $10,000 (just a round figure for example) up front, but they should be paying a minimum of $15,000 in agreed upon installments on a contract drawn up by a lawyer or paralegal (whichever's necessary where you are).<p>You're totally correct, when someone expects to pay you <i>less</i> for you assuming <i>more</i> risks and liability it's a shitty deal. The response should be along the lines of 'fuck you'. If they're genuinely interested, that means someone else likely is too, someone who probably isn't trying to screw you over.<p>OP: If you're asking us whether this is a good deal or not, it's probably because you already know it's a crappy deal. Add 20% to your initial offer and say you're willing to take say 50% of advertising revenues as payment for maintaining the site (assuming you're making a profit off of it now). If they really believe they'll boost your readership + revenue streams then this way will negotiate out good, however that's not what it looks like they're interested in.<p>This is like owning an apartment building and being made a buy out offer saying ""We don't want to pay the 15% down payment, would you be willing to forgo the total amount in lieu of increased pay as the super if you increase occupancy rates."" It'd be a retarded offer to accept.",1283050658

1642948,comment,1642790,1642790,0,0,AlexBlom,,,"Sorry guys, server has not crashed like this before even from HN traffic. Will look into it. Below is a copy paste (w/o the cool pictures):<p>------------------------<p>Several weeks ago I wrote that social media is not new. I only partially called out the pony, rainbow and unicorn practitioner's though. I’ve been ‘doing the Twitter’ for years now and social media gurus there is what teenage girls once were to Myspace. Worse, these gurus claim to be offering professional services.<p>If I had my say they would all be trampled by elephants. So, without further ado, here are my top 5 reasons your social media guy needs to be trampled by an elephant.
Ponies, Rainbows and Unicorns<p>Ask them what they do. The answer: I engage people, I create relationships, I add a layer of transparency. They may as well talk about ponies, rainbows and unicorns.<p>Now, my friends, is when we run screaming. I can put glass dividers in an office and add transparency. Engaging people is useless without anchoring it to a brand and a business goal. Ask them specifically what they do and who they target (i.e. I create digital campaigns to demographic x to inform them of product y). Gold star if they can hit 1/2. Sometimes the sun, stars, moon and seas are perfectly aligned somebody can answer this.<p>Perhaps one of my favourite past-times at conferences is to talk to these guys and constantly tell them that ‘engaging people’ is not something and ask for something more specific. Watch their heads explode, just like here. I see it as public service.<p>What’s a bottom line?<p>When talking to the next social media ‘guru’ you meet, ask them what bottom line impact their campaigns had. Note: bottom line is not engaged people, viral buzz or new followers; bottom line is the amount of sales their campaign generated, customer support queries it solved etc.<p>Don’t let them talk about ponies, rainbows and unicorns here. Maybe they just never did “math” in school so be really basic: You were paid this much by the big nice executive. In turn, you generated him this many dollars so he had this many left over.<p>Social Media is ‘it’<p>As I’ve pointed out before, social media is not the everything. It is a component of something bigger. Perhaps it is aligned with your recruitment strategy (run screaming if they had never thought of this). Maybe it is timed with other marketing activities. But when you meet one who honestly believes everything can be solved socially take pity, it is not their fault. Some people are not born as smart as others. You know, the ones who don’t move for the elephant.<p>I can’t afford a graphics guy<p>Yep, I thought the Myspacer’s were terrible but I think the gurus have taken the crown. We all put photos on our site but seriously guys, get a professional photo and photoshop it properly. There is no excuse to have white edges on your photos from a poor cut out nor should I feel like you just scanned last night’s DUI photos.<p>Don’t worry though, social media gurus, I get that these professional services are expensive and you can’t afford them. That’s because you don’t understand business and can’t charge for what you do. I’ve taken the liberty of doing some research, most Universities offer great marketing programs.<p>Wait, my Apple runs on Unix? or What’s a Unix?<p>Betting on a social guru with no technology training is like betting on the Mayans. No, they don’t have to be coders, engineers or designers but you need to fundamentally understand your field. Would you hire a plumber who didn’t know water went downhill?<p>If your guru lacks any technical knowledge it’s time to call the elephants over.",1283048802

   operators – savvy, confident, operators.""
</code></pre>
Furthermore, if someone sets out to find RR but looks instead for tough, you'll miss the set of people who are relentlessly resourceful -- but who are still ""young, sheepish technical founders.""  Not all rectangles are squares, etc.<p>Is that definitive?  Is it always true?  No, of course not -- we're talking about human properties that vary as much as humans.  But I wouldn't want to look for relentless resourcefulness by looking for toughness.<p>He's looking at confidence & poise as indicators of toughness.  He saw the demo day, and he's dividing people into operators and sheepish 'technical founders'.<p>You may say tough as a shorthand for relentless resourcefulness.  He's saying tough to mean the opposite of geek.<p>So the question, i suppose, is how do you, pg, evaluate people for toughness?  The OP seems to be using a mix of posture & anthropology combined with business benchmarks.<p><pre><code>  ""Wimps don’t really get anything done – they don’t release
  a product, they don’t make sales, they don’t raise money,
  hey balk at big problems, they quit before they should.""
</code></pre>
His definition of ""wimp"" seems totally irrelevant to actual performance under pressure, and would be a terrible litmus test.  Can you ship without ever pushing through low points?  Yes, you can ship crap.  Can you make sales & raise money without being RR?  Yes, you can be lucky.  Is it evident, or can you see -- from a demonstration day! -- when people have balked at big problems or quit before they should?  Probably not!<p>Finally, his definition of wimp/tough might be ""true"" -- whatever the hell that means -- but i find it useless, and maybe worse than useless if it leads you disqualify many people who are RR.  True/False is easy, but useful/useless is much harder to evaluate.<p>A useful statement about the mental traits of founders would be nice to have.  A useful test would be even better.  That's what i'm trying to get at.",1283048724

It is precisely because music is emotion/physiological/psychological that it gives us a great deal of insights into not only individual human beings, but the movements and ideas of entire societies.<p>Stravinsky, who's ""Poetics of Music""[1] is one of the more brilliant treatises on the importance of ""high"" music, once famously stated the ""music doesn't have the power to express anything at all""-- his entire belief is that music is a reflection of the people and societies in which it develops. He above all placed music in a higher realm because of what it uniquely taught about people<p>The belief that there is an objectivity to judging music isn't a popular one, but it is one that I believe to be rather self-evident. Certainly the depth of emotional response to the opening of Beethoven's 9th Symphony[2] should be dramatically different from the response to the latest Britney Spears single. Certainly Bob Dylan's music teaches us something far more complex and valuable about the culture in which it arose than does a jingle from a car commercial.<p>Indeed, looking through the major musical time periods, it is clear that the representative ""geniuses"" of each are are elevated as such precisely because their music <i>teaches us</i> something about that time period. Bach's music is unerringly rational, but always highly ornamented. His greatest works are often religious, and reflect the emerging force of Protestantism. Mozart's contrast greatly, with emphasis on balance and elegance, and are often more ""absolute"" (and thus ""secular"", although this distinction is somewhat artificial). Etc. Etc.<p>Simply contrast two symphonies: Beethoven 3[3] with Copland 3[4]. I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the argument that the boisterous triumphalism of the former doesn't crystalize the specific emotions, cultural trends, and overall ideas of the Napoleonic era, or that the latter could have emerged from any culture other than that of individualist America.<p>And this is just scratching the surface. I haven't even mentioned the dedecophonic serialism of Schoenberg and its clear roots in the modernist era, and I skipped completely the Romantic era from which Chopin, the original topic of discussion, sprung.<p>All of which to say, is: I think you are short-changing one of the single most powerful elements of human culture, and in doing so, genuinely short-changing yourself out of <i>both</i> greater pleasure and understanding.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Poetics-Music-Lessons-Harvard-paperbacks/dp/0674678567"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Poetics-Music-Lessons-Harvard-paperbac...</a>

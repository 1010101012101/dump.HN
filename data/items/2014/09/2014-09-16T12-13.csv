Even better if it is reproducible in something common like Windows&#x27; calculator.<p>Despite the fact that people think of FP math as &quot;inexact&quot; the truth is that it is theoretically exact in the sense that all the arithmetic operations are defined in terms of simple operations on bits just like with integer math (although with more complex combinations of operations), and there is no nondeterminism - the same operation on the same operands should <i>always</i> yield the same bit representations for <i>all</i> combinations of operands. The only inexactness comes from the use of binary fractions, but it is still deterministic.<p>I suppose for GPUs there is a line of reasoning that says &quot;if the viewer won&#x27;t notice the diference, then maybe it doesn&#x27;t matter and we can accept a quantifiably nonzero error rate&quot; but this would be absolutely unacceptable for GPGPU, and I very strongly hope designers of general-purpose FPUs (like x86 and ARM) never go down this dangerous path.<p>(Of course, you should rule out things like overclocked hardware causing these differences.)",1410871921

I can relate to this sort of exeprience.<p>I used to be moderately to severely depressed at least somewhat in part because I wanted to get something done by a certain date, but I didn&#x27;t have the focus or motivation to touch it. As the deadline creeps closer and closer and the dust collects on your git repo, you tend to feel a growing sense of despair that maybe you should just give up because you&#x27;re not good enough.<p>Then you say screw it, turn off the computer, go watch a stupid movie with your friends while talking about inane things like the upcoming World of Warcraft expansion. The sun sets, the pizza is delivered, maybe vast quantities of soda and/or alcohol are consumed if that&#x27;s your thing. The night wears on, everyone goes their own separate ways. As you lay down in bed, staring at the ceiling reflecting on how happy this evening made you feel, you realize you&#x27;re too stimulated to sleep. Then your mind goes back to your project. Not the deadline, but the reason why you started it in the first place. And for once, you focus not on the gulf between where you are and where you ought to be, but rather the next feature you can&#x27;t wait to implement. So you turn on your laptop and code until the early dawn hours. Then you remember you had to work the next day.<p>And that is why I have a severe coffee addiction. But it beats burn-out.",1410871408

So how annoying it is when you&#x27;re bootstrapping a company, you have your price-points carefully set, you&#x27;re doing a cracker job at concentrating on &#x27;how to sustain the company without investors capital&#x27; and then <i>boom</i>. Out of the blue some never-heard-of before company that does the same thing you do starts to hit your customers with a price point that you simply can not beat because they are able to &#x27;burn baby burn&#x27; or maybe even give away that identical product for free because they&#x27;re racing for an acquisition before the money runs out.<p>That&#x27;s real trouble. Sometimes it&#x27;s not just one.<p>But there is good news: they usually don&#x27;t survive in the longer term because they don&#x27;t have a business model. Once it&#x27;s free you can&#x27;t really go back to &#x27;old-fashioned&#x27;.<p>So once they&#x27;ve folded up, you&#x27;ve bought their Aeron chairs at 5 cents on the dollar and you&#x27;re re-connecting with your old customers and picking up the pieces you have a fairly clear field. Contaminated by an over-promising under-performing competitor that thought that &#x27;growth&#x27; is equal to &#x27;health&#x27;. (If that were true then cancer or a locust plague would be good news.) How you&#x27;re going to survive the interregnum of unfair VC funded competition is a really hard question for which I have no other advice than to cut every bit of spending and go into &#x27;cockroach&#x27; or &#x27;spore&#x27; mode, hang on to your core team at any price.<p>VCs should be far far more critical about the companies that they invest in, that the path to break even is clear and that they are not going to invest in a company whose business model is broken but where the cracks are paved over with marketing and growth by burning investors money.<p>That just spoils the soup for everybody and sometimes it kills entire segments.<p>Especially companies where investment is made in B, C or even later rounds should be looked at very carefully. A healthy company would survive and grow even without VC investment, it&#x27;s supposed to be an accelerator, <i>not</i> life support.<p>So burn, but burn with care and a very good plan. Concentrate on your bottom line taking into account that VC capital will not last forever and make sure that the transition from &#x27;supported&#x27; to &#x27;unsupported&#x27; is a smooth one and that your business model does not somehow depend on the &#x27;supported&#x27; bit in a hidden way.<p>If you&#x27;re partying like it&#x27;s 1999 you&#x27;re definitely doing it wrong and your bubble will almost certainly pop, the more VC money there is the more of it will be dumb.",1410871341

All of the language of the acquisition is that they will be using this tech to reinforce what they already do.<p><i>I&#x27;m excited to announce that we&#x27;ve agreed to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology.<p>Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we&#x27;re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences.</i><p>And that&#x27;s why people hate this acquisition, because OVR <i>could</i> have been so much more than just yet another vehicle for FB to push social. FB social could have been just <i>one</i> aspect of what OVR could have enabled, now it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> thing.",1396112360
7492891,comment,7486561,7492190,1,0,visakanv,,,"Allow me to clarify. The difference between a failed-state dictator and a benevolent one isn&#x27;t how much money they have in their banks at the end of it, but how much they grew their nation/state/company/organization/brand in the process. I think it&#x27;s fine for a CEO to be compensated in the billions if he does it by making his company billions more. It&#x27;s a question of the relationship the CEO has with wealth- does she help to create it, or is she just siphoning it into her pockets?<p>It&#x27;s not always clear, but I think it&#x27;s an important thing to consider. The size of a CEO&#x27;s bank account alone is insufficient information for a meaningful answer.",1396112345
7492890,comment,7491003,7491594,1,0,oxtopus,,,"In one of my previous roles as a software engineer at a local, independent office supply company, this would have been a compelling idea.  They ran a small fleet of leased delivery trucks, and employed drivers hourly, so as a company there is an incentive to reduce delivery costs, and the benefits.  At $29 per vehicle per month, it seems like optimized routes would pay for itself relatively quickly.  You&#x27;d need only to shave a few hours and miles off the routes per month to cover the cost, and then anything else is pure cost saving.<p>However, I think there are some caveats.  Drivers were given all items at the beginning of the day with a set of destinations and a deadline.  As long as everything was delivered by the end of the day, everyone was happy.  Sometimes there were exceptions, and multiple trips needed to be made, or certain customers needed to be given priority at the discretion of the sales rep.  Obviously, the drivers aren&#x27;t interested in optimized routes, as that would cut their pay, and other factors would override the initial route decisions.<p>Best case scenario, the company is at a point where they are having to turn away customers, and they are able to increase their revenue by adding capacity through optimized routes.",1396112341

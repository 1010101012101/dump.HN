I say no.<p>First of all, a 404 response needs to be sent regardless so that a script can check for 404 and handle that as deemed appropriate. If I got a 301 or 302 to what the server thought was what I was looking for, the script won't know that the server is now guessing at what I wanted. I assume this is important for bots like the google crawler.<p>Second, content with that 404 is very useful. It adds context to a user that cares. A well designed 404 will tell the user that the page/item/person/etc couldn't be found. Then it will offer an action such as suggestions of what it could be. Getting back to my ""userr"" example, there could be links to ""user"", ""users"", etc. There could be a prominent search feature or a way to report this to the company. Maybe a way to contact support, like a live chat widget. Further more, a 404 in your logs are very useful to look for what is commonly not found. Do people regularly try going to example.com/login even though your login page is at example.com/user_login? Apache access logs will show this very nicely and you can then decide to manually add a redirect.",1323291399

When users see ""Merry Christmas"" rather than ""Happy Holidays"", they might be more likely to just read the subject line and open the message without checking the sender, assuming it's from a friend.  ""MC"" also sounds (to me) more like an email that is being sent with a specific purpose (as opposed to just a reminder that the company  exists), e.g., maybe the company is offering you free bingo cards as a gift.",1323290710

That's all.<p>The dwindling great news organizations are like a good university -- you have amazing resources at your disposal, you are surrounded by peers who hold you to a very high standard -- so by that measure traditional journalists lucky enough to work at a place which still provides that infrastructure have a leg up. Internet journalism at its best has proven that that what those institutions offer at their height are merely great tools to get the job done, but they don't at all define what the job is. The medium, and even the resources available, don't make a good journalist. They can help, sure, but what makes a good journalist is being a good journalist.<p>Its a lame and simple point to be making, but it was a direct reply to the parent post.<p>---<p>To really get dicey... The parent post argued that the Internet has shown that everybody can be a journalist. I really strongly disagree, but I guess that's because it boils down to an argument about ""what is a journalist."" If ""journalism"" to you is ""telling someone what you saw,"" then yes we are all journalists, Tweeting about our sandwiches! Imparting information concisely to your audience, fact checking, treating the information you're handed not as the end of the job --as information to be straight-up regurgitated-- but instead as the beginning --facts to confirm, stories to investigate, quotes to react to-- is the stuff that matters to me when the word ""journalist"" is applied to someone. That is a real, complicated thing that few want to do, and even fewer are good at, let alone ""everybody.""<p>Anybody can copy and paste a press release, anybody can provide a tip on what's happening around them spatially, but not everybody can be bothered to follow it up and make sense of it. Journalism is taking a ton of information, coupling it with original research, and synthesizing it down to something people can understand. You don't need a newsroom for that, nor does being on the Internet magically make you better at it. That's all I'm saying!",1323290429

* Word marks such as Apple and iPad; 
* Logos such as the apple logo; 
* Sounds such as the ""Intel inside"" sequence of notes; 
* Colors, even (sometimes) such as pink for Owens-Corning-brand attic insulation.<p>(Trademarks are for products; service marks serve the same function for services.)<p>In a sense, the ""owner"" of a trademark is really just its government-appointed custodian or guardian.

I'd say look at LESS or SASS (they're basically the same) because that's what I'm most experienced with. Here's why it makes sense to use these languages:<p>First off, these languages help you write faster, and more efficiently. They mostly take a lot of the repetition and mental strain out of writing code. In my experience with LESS I'm always able to do things faster and don't have to remember color names or keep track of certain styles that I repeat many times especially if they include vendor prefixes.<p>Then once you've ""compiled"" the code it's the same as if you were to write it normally. Some may say ""so what's the point then?"" but again I must repeat that you are able to work more efficiently and still have yourself normal, totally compatible CSS, js, or HTML.<p>As far as performance goes, there really is no loss in performance as your abstracted code is compiled to the everyday kind with option to minify it too. I use LESS for all ky styling and on my Mac I use either Less.app or CodeKit which automatically detects changes to my .less files and compiles them on the fly to normal .css ones. The source of every page always asks for normal .css files and I really don't have to do any extra work besides making sure the app outputs my stylesheets in the right folder. As a bonus, CodeKit also minifies most languages, detects and syntax errors, and does some image optimization. On my Linux box, I just run a quick terminal command and the compiling takes a couple seconds. Barely any extra work at all.<p>The only time I'd see ant performance issues is if you were doing client or server side parsing/compiling of these abstraction languages in production. For example, you can use less.js and have your .less files linked in your HTML and it'll turn it into CSS on the fly. That would be a problem. Otherwise, as long as you're taking your HAML, CoffeeScript, LESS/SASS/SCSS, and whatever else and converting it to everyday js, CSS, and HTML then you have nothing to lose and everything to gain.<p>I used to believe like you that these superset languages were just a novelty and had no truly useful purpose. Then I tried LESS and still thought it was lame for a short time (I only grasped the concept of variables and thought the only benefit was being able to name colors) until I really understood it and now I can't live without it. Give one of these a try and I think you'll appreciate them.<p>Edit: I understand that not all of these work the same. For those that require server or client side parsing with no option to convert prior to production then you have a point. But most of these abstracted, superset languages can be compiled to normal CSS/HTML/js before production and those are the ones that are truly beneficial.",1323289557

1) Prepare students for participating in the market economy
2) Provide learning for the sake of learning<p>It's best to separate these two things.  First of all, doing (1) shouldn't take 4 years for most people.  And it definitely shouldn't be four years of classroom learning interspersed with summer's of ""real work.""<p>And doing (2) is something that shouldn't be tied to how we sustain ourselves economically (i.e. getting jobs).  Learning for the sake of learning really needs to be limited to those who:
(a) have an aptitude for it
(b) have the passion for it
Otherwise, you're pretty much wasting everyone's time.<p>How would this look in practice?  I don't know, but I bet will start seeing this pattern emerge.<p>The demand probably won't come from students.

3325725,comment,3325101,3325101,14,0,stephenjudkins,,,"This is the largest practical issue I've had with developing a Scala project.<p>One major cause of the problem seems to be that Scala is stuck with the ""precompiled bytecode in JARs"" model of software distribution; while this may be appropriate for Java (where core developers go through <i>great pains</i> to maintain compatibility between versions) it seems like a poor fit for Scala. Not only do the core library APIs change between versions, but the conventions used by the compiler to ""link"" Scala code together are also altered, for good reason.<p>An alternative distribution mechanism that's more resistant to these kinds of issues might make sense. Even just distributing source code and build files (like, say, Ruby) could be a better solution. Building dependencies might be slow at first, but centralized caching could address this. Another solution might be an intermediate representation (after type-checking and other compiler phases, but before ""linking"") that gives the Scala compiler the knowledge that's missing from compiled class files.<p>Even namespace-mangling or class-loader magic could be helpful here. Loading multiple versions of a single dependency should in theory be possible, since OSGi manages it.<p>Sadly, there seems to be a pretty large investment by the Scala community in the whole Java/Maven/JAR ecosystem. It'd take a concerted effort by many people to create a more robust solution.",1323288850

Without going very deep into its details, consider that many kind of identities are involved. They correspond to Object since I'm using a OOP language.<p>- There are <i>Guys</i> that inhabit the world simulated
- There are <i>Maps</i>
- A map has many <i>Lots</i>, that are pieces of land with some characteristics
- There are <i>Tribes</i> (guys belong to tribes)
- There is a generic class called <i>Position</i> to locate the elements
- There are <i>Bots</i> in control of tribes that move guys around
- There is a <i>World</i> that represents the world simulated<p>and so on.<p>If the simulated world was laid down as a database, the objects would be tables with lots of references, but in memory I have to use a different strategy. So, for example, a Tribe has an array of Guys as a property, The world has a, array of Bots, of Tribes, of Maps. A Map has a Dictionary whose key is a Position and whose value is a Lot. A Guy has a Position that is where he stands.<p>The way I lay down such connections is pretty much arbitrary. For example, I could have an array of Guys in the World, or an Array of guys per Lot (the guys standing on a piece of land), or an array of Guys per Bot (with the Guys controlled by the bot).<p>Doing so, I also have to pass around a lot of objects. For example, a Bot must have informations about the Map and opponent Guys to decide how to move its Guys.<p>As said, in a database I'd have a Guys table connected to the Lots table (indicating its position), to the Tribe table (indicating which Tribe it belongs to) and so it would also be easy to query ""All the guys in Position [1, 5]"". ""All the Guys of Tribe 123"". ""All the Guys controlled by Bot B standing on the Lot b34 not belonging to the Tribe 456"" and so on.<p>I've worked with APIs where to get the simplest information you had to make an instance of the CustomerContextCollection and pass it to CustomerQueryFactory to get back a CustomerInPlaceQuery to... When people criticize OOP and cite verbose abstractions that soon smell ridiculous, that's what I mean. I want to avoid such things and having to relay on deep abstractions and (anti pattern) abstract contexts.<p>The question is: what is the preferred, clean way to manage entities and collections of entities that are deeply linked in multiple ways?",1323288762

The other two are receiving and storing. :)<p>Even sending by itself is such a complicated beast that only a select few allow customers to do it properly, and to <i>properly</i> do sending you must have receiving end set up as well. Your deliverability goes up when you allow replies to the sending host.  ESPs see replies as participation and it makes a difference.  That's why we keep preaching: No more no-reply emails.<p>Another elephant in the room is spam. If you silently accept everything coming to your MX host, you're asking for it. That's how some email platforms do the receiving end. GMail can get away with this because they employ a small army of PhD's to deal with spam. To have manageable volumes of spam, you've got to be able to generate SMTP bounces for invalid addresses. The list of things to do in order to receive properly goes on and on. Hooking up incoming SMTP traffic to a Python function is the <i>easiest</i> part of receiving mails.<p>Long story short: if email is critical to your app, you have very limited options. Roll your own or sign up for Mailgun, which is basically a Gmail-like back-end which makes your application look and feel like a <i>real</i> email server to other ESPs, not a mass sender of $0.0001 emails. Mailgun also has other advantages like automatic cleanup of garbage MIME bodies - this always hits you hard in production, and standard MIME parsers for most languages won't cut it.",1323288107

You can learn everything you want yourself for free, instead of going to a college and pay an enormous amount of money for it. Especially now with the Internet, most materials you find online are multiple times better quality than what you get at college. Most graduates need to receive considerable additional training when they join a company. Bottom line is:<p>You don't go to college to learn; you go to college to get a paper certificate that you can show to others.<p>It's the problem of signalling and unfortunately, there's no easy solution for it. Colleges profit from the information imbalance and lack of trust in the job market. Some people recommend that instead of your certificates, your past projects should make up your resume. But then you get a catch 22 because others won't risk starting a project with you, unless they can see that you're capable from your resume. The only way to break out of this is the people you're going to work with must already know your abilities beforehand. Hence, you can start a start-up with your close friends or on your own, or become a vice president by knowing the right people at a company. For everything else, you need a resume for which Colleges are the gate keepers. And they won't give away that power for free. So enjoy your debt.<p>Signalling

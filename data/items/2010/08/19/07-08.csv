1616780,story,,,3,1,fredben,"What can I offer friends for investing instead of equity?",,"I've set up a company which looks like it will be receiving some angel investment in the next 3-6 months. In the meantime we need to raise a small amount of extra cash (3-5000) to push out a couple of features and keep us ticking over.<p>Friends and Family have offered to help out and keep asking if they can have a share in the company in exchange. I don't want to do this mainly because I know that having a number of small investors involved can put off larger investors as well as make things more complicated later on. Not to mention it's quite a lot of work just for a small investment. The alternative is obviously a loan but family/friends seem quite opposed to that as they've bad experiences and feel investing would be more fun.<p>So - does anyone have any ideas of how I could offer a reward system for small investments so that they feel involved and can benefit if we do well but without muddying the waters for future investors?<p>(To clairfy - I have no problem with giving up equity or rewarding people who have taken a risk on me - I just don't want to risk future 6-figure investment by having a whole load of small shareholders)",1282204677

Alternative computing architectures, such as parallel digital computers have not tended to be commercially viable, because Moore’s Law has consistently enabled conventional von Neumann architectures to render alternatives unnecessary. Besides Moore’s Law, digital computing also benefits from mature tools and expertise for optimizing performance at all levels of the system: process technology, fundamental circuits, layout and algorithms. Many engineers are simultaneously working to improve every aspect of digital technology, while alternative technologies like analog computing do not have the same kind of industry juggernaut pushing\nthem forward.",1282204499

When I was young my little sister was almost killed in a car accident because she was in the back seat of a station wagon when they were rear-ended by an SUV. SUVs don't have the same bumper level that other cars do, so instead of impacting the designed crumple zone, the SUV rolled up into the back window of the station wagon. Another foot and she would have been decapitated.<p>Subsequently, I've seen a couple sources which corroborate this trend -- in high speed accidents between cars and SUVs the fatality rates where higher than two cars.",1282204243

He went to the department head and said, ""Since I'm not doing research, why don't you just schedule me to teach more courses?""  He was turned down because the department head didn't want him to make the other professors look bad.  He made the offer repeatedly until he got tired of hearing the nos.<p>The end result?  He puttered around for 15 years after that.  His classes were always well attended.  Students who attended his section of the course always did better on tests.  But he never again got a promotion, and he was never allowed to teach any more courses than anyone else.<p>I think that a system without tenure would have forced him to make choices that made him happier.  A system that actually rewarded teaching would have both made him happier, and have served the students well.",1282204118

Proof is required, always. And everyone is bettered by an open an honest debate that patiently brings people around by convincing them with a sound argument backed by evidence. At some point it's important to recognize when an intellectual opponent is no longer worth debating, but that doesn't justify shutting down debate entirely, or of refusing to reach out and attempt to convince others who might be more open minded.<p>Indeed, this is quite critical, especially today. Because guess what? Atheists, and believers in, say, evolution, we are in the minority. Even in the liberal and intellectual modern western world. Far more so in the world at large.

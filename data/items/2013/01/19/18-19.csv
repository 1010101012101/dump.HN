""If you're young and think you're hot shit, and there's some reason to believe you are, you can go far, very quickly.""<p>When I think back at my time prior to going to University, I really did think this way. And I had reason to. Even during my time at University, that feeling never escaped me.<p>Once I entered full-time employment (almost by accident. I had started my own limited company at this point), my attitude changed completely. I was surrounded by so many people so unbelievably more clever than me, I was humbled. It wasn't just their abilities, but their ""maturity"".<p>Now I cringe to think of my attitude as little as 5 years ago. And I think I have reason to. Where I used to take pride in ""fixing your 6-month problem in 4 days"", I now realise I failed on a lot of aspects. I am now much more focused on doing things <i>right</i>. I focus on listening and understanding, on being tolerant and empathetic. I measure my work in quality, maintainability, measurable evidence. Every day I try my hardest to learn and to be a pioneer.<p>I do think this is a positive improvement. But when I come across an article like this one, and recall my youthful naivety and enthusiasm, I do worry if I haven't perhaps lost something more important.",1358621991

Then hitting ""Open PDF"" opens a new tab which stalls out and crashes<p>I would almost say its actually a PDF thing that is crashing Safari vs a JS thing.<p>At least, that's what has happened consistently on my machine with latest Safari and WebKit nightly.<p>Edit: However, taking the generated PDF from Chrome and dropping it into Safari loads it fine, so maybe it is a JS thing.<p>Edit 2: Upon further inspection it appears the new tab is being opened with just a data URL representing the entire PDF.

No one likes admitting they're fallible initially... it takes practice =) And I've had lots and lots of practice.<p>In grad school it sounds like it is not unlike his description of silicon valley (minus the piles of cash, dominance of Caucasians, and lack of women, of course). If you're confident, aggressive, and think you're good at what you're doing, you will probably end up being so eventually. At least if you are able to take your own fallibility in stride.<p>I remember trying to explain things to younger students (and often postdocs too) and asking often ""does that make sense?"" and ""do you know what I mean by ..."" and getting rapid nods. I wasn't asking because I'm trying to make them look stupid, I'm asking because the subject material is legitimately really hard, and no one knows all of it offhand. No one. And then this is followed up a week later by them clearly obviously definitively not having understood a word I said. Whereas if they had admitted to not knowing what I was talking about, I would have stepped back a bit further and explained it from an earlier stage with no problem.<p>One of my biggest domain examples of my own was when I was like ""oh, the melting point of copper is really high, surely it will work okay as a conductor at 500C"".

It's annoying that everyone who writes about the CFAA needs to provide a benediction. The Swartz tragedy does not want for sympathy, emotion, or action-spurring anger. But we can always use more (respectful) critical thinking.<p>It's especially annoying in critiques of Kerr's writing. Kerr's goals were to answer some basic questions. Did the prosecution stretch the CFAA to make a case against Swartz where none was warranted? Was the prosecution's conduct towards Swartz unusually cruel? Is there any legitimate public policy purpose animating the CFAA and wire fraud statutes? In discussing these questions, Kerr more or less stipulates that Swartz did what prosecutors alleged he did. But that's all it is: a stipulation. ""Assuming"", Kerr asks, ""that Swartz did all this stuff --- and it looks like he did --- let us take a clear-eyed look at whether and how any miscarriage of justice occurred.""<p>To berate Kerr for not adequately addressing the question of Swartz's innocence is to miss the point of the two articles.",1358620839

Pundits are fond of wagging a finger at the fact that 9x% of convicted offenders never had a jury trial while overlooking the fact that for the overwhelming majority of those cases, a jury trial would have been pointless. No court system in the world could handle the volume of cases that would result from a majority of charges being heard by a jury.<p>I submit that the real culprit here isn't misconduct stemming from overcharging, but rather from our careless and illogical sentencing guidelines.

The difference between $500 and $1000000 in damages in a CFAA case is a number in the middle of a for() loop. This isn't a novel challenge for the criminal code; other offenses have more reasonable sentencing and ""aggravation"" elements as well. Swartz's sentence should have involved the extent to which his intentions were commercial, how many co-conspirators he roped in, how much of a challenge he made it for the prosecution to investigate him, how much damage he caused, how recklessly that damage was caused. These are familiar elements of criminal and civil cases and could apply in CFAA cases too, had the law been written more carefully.",1358620510

This is wrong for two reasons. One, the hagiography is factually wrong, no matter how generously anyone uses the word ""genius."" Two, conclusions about prosecutorial discretion do not follow from it.<p>We need to distinguish between decisions made before and after Aaron's death. It is totally fair to say that Kerr's blogposts - or my attempts to remind programmers what they thought about Aaron when he was alive - lack ""sympathy."" But what exactly does Boyle think should have made the prosecutors sympathetic to Aaron when they brought their charges against him? His lawyers' claim that he might be psychologically unstable? His desire for attention from the geek community? His on-and-off friendship with Lessig or Doctorow? His history of writing code as a volunteer? His involvement in a sale of a company to Conde-Nast?<p>To use my example from another thread, let's say Brian Behlendorf gets arrested for DUI while on the way to a conference to talk about free software. Should we be sympathetic because he gave us the Apache httpd server (something a thousand times - maybe a hundred thousand times - more significant than any code Aaron ever wrote)?<p>By the by, I do feel like a jerk for not being more ""sympathetic"" to Aaron now that he is dead. But when the people around you turn your case into a political football and say the government killed you, it is fair game to try to put things into perspective.",1358619263

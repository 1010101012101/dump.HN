I made a habit of keeping a container of oatmeal (bought in large bags from costco - no steel cut, but good enough) soaked in soy/cow milk in the refrigerator overnight. Serve cold the next morning with dried or fresh fruit or whatever else you might fancy (yes, it's muesli). For cold mornings, I'll go with hot oatmeal instead and steel cut, otherwise it's too much work to serve steel cut oats cold. It's a really flexible food with (what is to me) an infinite combination when it comes to toppings, and best of all it's cheap and nutritious.",1242557810

Choosing a template, say 5_h_7_s_9_j, and replacing the _ with characters from the site's name works (and you could increment the characters or whatever), but if anyone gets two of your passwords it's pretty obvious there's a pattern and it's not particularly hard to work out the relationship between the site name and the password.",1242557267

There's just something so satisfying and delicious about making your own that I only buy from the store when I can't make and store enough ice cream for a party.<p>Here's two of my favorite recipes from my favorite David Lebovitz (he has the BEST ice cream recipes, I swear...):

They were.<p>There's plenty of stuff on the net, and you can compute it for yourself.

613262,comment,613101,613259,0,0,johnnybgoode,,,"That's my point. A big-budget film is a big risk. Film studios wouldn't take on the added risk of two or more big-budget movies at once without a good reason. The benefit is that it saves money in production, so they do it when the financial success of the sequel(s) is close to a sure thing.",1242556925

Digital distribution is easier than physical distribution.<p>But it is entirely dependent upon the source material being permissive-use. When it isn't, derivatives become illegal material, and people will subsequently choose not to make value-added derivatives because any profit motive that would have existed is gone; settlement and legal fees are likely to wipe out any gains.<p>This doesn't affect the consumers of media, however, because consumers are largely anonymous and hard to target by the legal system.

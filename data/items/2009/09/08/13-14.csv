810964,comment,810399,810930,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Respectfully, I disagree with you.  ""The Little Engine that Could"" says that if you want to do something, and you try hard enough, you will succeed.  That's simply wrong.  I want to run 100m in 8s, but no matter how hard I try it's not going to happen.<p>But that's not what he said.  He said you have to work hard, and without hard work you're unlikely/not going to succeed.  That's pretty much true, and it's certainly better than assuming you can succeed without hard work.  The probability of that happening is non-zero, but small.<p>Who was it that said ""The harder I work, the luckier I get.""<p>So I'm interested in which part you disagree with.  Let's see the bits I quoted:<p><pre><code>    But the truth is, being successful is hard.\n</code></pre>\nYup, I'd agree with that.<p><pre><code>    You won’t love every subject you study.\n</code></pre>\nThat's certainly true.<p><pre><code>    You won’t click with every teacher.\n</code></pre>\nThat's true enough.<p><pre><code>    Not every homework assignment will seem\n    completely relevant to your life right\n    this minute.\n</code></pre>\nHard to disagree with that.<p><pre><code>    And you won’t necessarily succeed at\n    everything the first time you try.\n</code></pre>\nThe conditional makes that hard to disagree with, but even so, it's pretty much true.<p><pre><code>    ... you can’t let your failures define\n    you – you have to let them teach you.\n</code></pre>\nThat's a philosophy I agree with through and through.  My failures - and there are plenty - are not me, and I have learned from them.<p>So, let me finish by asking this.  Correlation suggests - but does not prove - that the down-modding of my comment was done by you.  It happened at pretty much the same time as you comment, and your comment indicates that you disagree with its sentiment.  So let me ask:  Did you down-mod simply because you disagreed with the sentiment?  If so, with which part do you disagree?  Help me to understand you.<p>I thought down-modding was intended to be used when you thought a comment was of negative value.  Do you really think that quotation is of negative value?  I respect that you have your opinion, but I'd like to know what it is so I can choose to agree or disagree.  At the moment you simply seem to be wrong.",1252418153

It's a pretty nice productivity booster for flipping between different directories. It's quite easy to port to zsh, also.<p>2. Learn to use the editor modes on your shell. If you use Emacs mode in zsh, for example, things like transient-mark mode work with all the standard Emacs keybindings, and you can easily copy and paste pieces of your command line. vi mode also supports similar bells and whistles.<p>3. In zsh, if you are typing a command and then realize you need to look up its man page, move your cursor back to the command and hit Esc-h (or Meta-h or Alt-h, depending on your terminal). Once you quit the man viewer, your command line will be restored.<p>4. In zsh, if your command line gets too unwieldy to edit in zle, just hit Esc-e (Meta-e). It'll let you edit the command line in your editor (be sure your EDITOR environment variable is set).<p>5. zsh has an awesome buffer stack feature. Imagine you're typing a long command (call it command A), then realize that you need to run something else first (call it command B). Don't Ctrl-u or delete anything; leave your current command alone, and hit Esc-q. You'll get a fresh prompt. Run B. Once B executes, zsh will restore the command line from A. You can do this as many times as you want.<p>Anyway --- go and read ""From Bash to Z Shell, Conquering the Command Line"" by Kiddle, Peek, and Stephenson. I've never seen a better book on using shells with maximum efficiency (and I'm still only learning).

People like to put < and > on nil and think they're clever because they fixed their little routine that does a sort.  What they don't realize, is that they've possibly broken something else that depends on the Does Not Understand exception as part of its normal operation.  (Yes, remember there's only <i>one</i> nil object, and you have no comprehensive list of what implicit contracts it has to fulfill in the rest of the code base.  Certain proxy mechanisms can break.  I know of another mechanism in one Smalltalk's streams that would break as well.)<p>The correct way to replace your nil checks with polymorphism is with the MissingObject pattern.

For instance:<p><pre><code>    find . -name core -print0 | xargs -0 rm -f\n</code></pre>\nSince ""find"" doesn't know when your command is multi-file, it has to run the command once per file; whereas, ""xargs"" can run it as few times as necessary.  It works well for any command that accepts ""a list of files"".<p>In the example above, the -print0/-0 are a safety net to null-delimit filenames so that it doesn't matter if any of the paths contains a space.",1252414961

Yes, I was the piano salesman from the article. :)<p>Except -- I wasn't pushing a piano at the cost of a family vacation. I was selling a $5 for three issues ($25 off cover) re-subscription to a computer magazine. Experiencing how hard it actually was to push this offer gave me quite a bit of faith in humanity. 5 our of 6 said no and hung up before I got through my scripted pitch.<p>There's a certain sentiment against sales here. But where is that anger when someone is talking about their latest A/B test here? An A/B test is a test to find out which of two alternatives is better to make a visitor do what we want that visitor to do. Since the need for the A/B test, we can conclude that the visitor doesn't take that action be default. Thus, we're doing this design to manipulate the visitor to take an action that's not in his best interest? Because if it was in the his best interest, he should be doing it anyway, without the optimization, right?",1252414856

Often, the bad reviews just smell fishy to me.  My assumption is that there aren't really so many more somewhat dim pig-headed users who like to vote 1-star on the App Store than there are on Amazon.

I agree with everything the OP is saying.<p>My first point about ""flow"" is, I think, connected to this idea. Stupid wastes time. It breaks flow and replaces meaningful, objective feedback with noise. I also agree strongly that our happiness is correlated strongly with spending as much of our time on programming (I.e. real work) and as little time on stupid shit as possible.",1352505592

Lustre [1] or Dcache [2] or Xrootd [3]) to store these files across local storage on all the nodes of the cluster.<p>I think for big datasets some kind of support for these distributed filesystems will be necessary as most private (scientific) computing clusters use them. The complication is of course that to use these filesystems, one needs to build support for each access protocol into a python module (off the top of my head I'm not sure if they exist yet; perhaps they do). While most of these filesystems do offer standard posix 'mounting', this is usually not recommended for performance reasons.<p>Perhaps I'm outside of the intended use case anyway. To a certain extent this problem is solved for my field of research (of course nothing ever works all the time heh), as all LHC/OSG Computing Grid centers run the same Scientific Linux distribution with the theory being that any code that works on one should work on another.<p>But this sounds great for teaching classes and labs! I look forward to using it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Main_Page</a>

For example, Python's ""with"" statement.<p>In languages with macros, you don't need to wait for anyone to change the language because the entirety of the language is constructed from a few special operators, and you have the ability to continue constructing.<p>Like Python, Clojure has a ""with-open"" macro.  If Rich hadn't already added it, you could build it yourself:<p><pre><code>    ; Very simplified version
    (defmacro with-open [bindings & body]
     `(let ~bindings
        (try
          ~@body
          (finally (.close ~(first bindings))))))
</code></pre>
Thus this:<p><pre><code>    (with-open [in (reader ""/usr/share/dict/words"")]
      (count (line-seq in)))

Fortunately we don't do that.<p>When a filter is written in the client language it gets compiled into a protocol buffer which is sent to the cluster. This gets compiled into a query which is sent to each of the relevant shards for the table. This query has the filter baked right into it. The shards then go through their local copy of the data and filter out the rows which do not meet the query predicate. This data gets returned to the coordinating node and eventually to the user. Thus only the data the will actually be returned is ever transferred over the network.<p>Furthermore this process is done lazily. On the client side rather than getting back a huge array with the results of your filter you get back an iterator.

The biggest argument I've heard from other women on why they don't play more ""hardcore"" games is specifically that they feel like they aren't represented in the scenarios these games present and when there are females, they don't look (or act) like they should if they were really in those situations. You don't tend to get a history of how she got there and what she went through. She's just there, in a tight little number, ready to jump around and look pretty.<p>The second complaint is not wanting to deal with the gender targeting that comes with gaming, both online and off. Girls feel like they can't be themselves (or even speak) in-game without being seen as or treated like a lesser competitor and they feel like they can't talk about them in real life situations without being labeled as a try-hard or someone that only got into it because of a boyfriend/brother, not because they actually enjoy it. You'll hear a lot of girls recount situations in which they're asked what their favorite games are, and when they answer with titles that aren't obscure enough, are told they're not real gamers. This is not to say that  don't exist, but when you're treated like that's the norm, it's unsettling and makes you hesitant to bring the topic up in the future.<p>In having organized LANs for several years, I have dealt first-hand with the stares and questions dealing with my legitimacy in being there. Online, I've had entire teams target my player specifically and repeatedly with verbal assaults, kills and subsequent teabags despite having a gender-neutral name but a female avatar. It is not surprising at all to me why women would steer clear from this environment.<p>Third, a lot of women just don't talk about it because they don't see it differently from any other hobby they might have.<p>I think marketers just don't look hard enough to find who is really playing because they don't care.

Our results add IQ to the list of phenotypes that must be approached with great caution when considering published molecular genetic associations. In our view, excitement over the value of behavioral and molecular genetic studies in the social sciences should be temperedas it has been in the medical sciencesby a recognition that, for complex phenotypes, individual common genetic variants of the sort assayed by SNP microarrays are likely to have very small effects.<p>""Associations of candidate genes with psychological traits and other traits studied in the social sciences should be viewed as tentative until they have been replicated in multiple large samples. Failing to exercise such caution may hamper scientific progress by allowing for the proliferation of potentially false results, which may then influence the research agendas of scientists who do not realize that the associations they take as a starting point for their efforts may not be real. And the dissemination of false results to the public may lead to incorrect perceptions about the state of knowledge in the field, especially knowledge concerning genetic variants that have been described as 'genes for' traits on the basis of unintentionally inflated estimates of effect size and statistical significance.""<p>So my caution here would be that an unpublished working paper like this (a common form of preliminary sharing of speculative results in the discipline of economics) is very unlikely to be the definitive word on this interesting topic.",1352503355

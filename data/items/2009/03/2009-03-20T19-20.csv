Should I be donating to an inner city Charter school? Or to a public school run by the school district? The whole public education reform discussion is very complex, and even knowing several teachers (working in public and private institutions) I am having difficulty making up my mind.<p>My first hand experience in college gives me direct and clear insight into the benefits of that particular institution. So yes, it is not by coincidence that I'm donating to that institution in particular. Still, I would claim that this is also a good faith effort to ""support motivated students"" applied concretely.",1237579148

525478,comment,524837,524837,0,0,robotrout,,,"I quit my job with a baby on the way, 20 months ago.  In that time, the economy has tanked, so even if I wanted to go back to work, I wouldn't be able to find one anywhere near my old salary.<p>Am I sorry?  No.  I'm still very, very happy I had the guts to take the plunge and do it.  The fear of not having a steady paycheck is much worse than the reality.  Now that I know that, even if I do get another job, it won't have the same psychological hold over me.<p>However...<p>I had worked a lot longer than you have, before I made that plunge.  While I wish I had done it earlier, I think that 2.5 years is too early.  At 2.5 years into your career, you're still an apprentice.  You have a lot that corporate life can still teach you.<p>Here's what I did.<p>Every time I felt like you feel, I found another job.  I found it before I quit my first job, the safe way.  After about 2.5 years, almost like clockwork, I'd feel restless, and cranky with my current status, and go find another job.  I learned a lot that way and made a lot of friends.<p>When you think the time is near for you to take the plunge, do what I did.  Say to yourself, ""this job that I'm starting today will be my last job.  I will not allow myself to quit it to find another job.  No matter how much I hate it, I will not trade it for a new job.  I will only quit when I'm ready not to have a job at all.""<p>That vow kept me in my last job for an extra year or longer.  Time I would ordinarily have just hopped to a new job.  Finally, I decided my time was now, and I gave my notice, without even having any concrete plans on what kind of business I was going to build.  I just knew that I needed to be free.<p>To summarize, my advice is to job hop for a few years when you get unhappy, just like non-entrepreneurs to.  There's a lot to learn that 2.5 years won't teach you.",1237578993

It's safe to have it as a default choice. There's a good community, fantastic libraries, constant innovation, and people are really happy developing with it.<p>The notion that there's nothing wrong in choosing rails -- is now acceptable mainstream. Even the hard ass Java developers at my work can acknowedge that yes, it speeds up development to use a field tested full-stack framework instead of rolling your own framework for every project.

I've played games where the profile of a jump is straight-line up, straight-line down, with no acceleration concept relevant at all, which also eliminates ""terminal velocity"" as a concern... it's just velocity, period.<p>Unfortunately, the same is true of the authors of this paper, who assume with no evidence, or perhaps rather <i>against</i> the evidence, that standard Newtonian formulas hold and therefore they can compute ""accelerations"" and such. Newtonian formulas do not hold in the Mario-verse, or in platformers in general.<p>(In some cases the real formulas may be modeled on Newtonian formulas, but the full set almost never holds, ""equal-and-opposite force"" in particular. Please note that citing a single counter-example is insufficient to disprove ""almost never""; I can do that too, but it doesn't change the fact that most games use physics only loosely related to reality.)",1237578758

At that time two of the companies I worked for willfully jettisoned years of infrastructure in PHP based off the work some of the younger devs (including me) had snuck in with Rails (and Ruby). And it was quality, fast work.<p>If you had experience with Rails, you could stick out your thumb and get a fast train from the midwest to the Valley and get paid crazy money, too, because for some reason the business guys <i>needed</i> rails developers. The Rails conferences were a mix of pragmatic old school rubyists but also, many, many, young and talented devs, arrogant and quirky in the way young people are. Also there was a lot of free booze.<p>Of course, at the end of the day, we were all just software developers rallying around an slow language and imperfect framework, but it seemed like a lot of fun.

In my freelance experience, working with freelance designers, they are the worst when it comes to deadlines (even very loose ones).

He also seems to be saying, though, that ""dynamic higher order programming"" does not include closures, so I really don't know what it is.  If a closure is anything, it is certainly a function created at runtime.<p>He also seems to say a function composition operator is obviously bad, without any justification.  I guess if justification were required, it wouldn't be obvious.  I don't see the clear advantage of carrying around a data structure with multiple functions and a third function that composes them, versus just using a compose operator.  I suppose it's a little more opaque, but that is often a good thing (a kind of encapsulation).<p>""Of course, it may be slightly easier to optimize the result of dynamic code generation""<p>But maybe it's a lot easier?  Can we get a huge speedup, or just a little one?

525439,comment,524956,524956,0,0,mcslee,,,"One issue with data-driven design is that it can be incredibly inefficient for developing new behaviors. If you're changing hues, sure, it works. When it comes to building a novel interaction that might really push the needle, users typically won't learn it overnight. You can't test even two or three significant UI changes without incredible patience and inefficiency, because the data effects might not materialize for weeks, and the user re-education costs at each step are very high.<p>This effect is multiplied when you're trying to test design changes in products where users need to interact with one another (makes testing new design on only a subset of users incredibly difficult). Data-driven design in these contexts will likely just tell you to stick with what already seems to work.<p>At the moment, it's unclear if Google's really in the business of developing new user behaviors. They're operating a cash machine with reasonably well-understood dynamics, and will probably do pretty well just tuning it.

I've been looking at this problem from the point of view of distributed full text search, where I don't see any possibility of centralization in the manner you suggest.

Jobs would walk in and say ""yes"" or ""no"" and walk out. Took quite a few iterations. ;-)<p>(To be clear, this was the internal re-engineering effort to make the Aqua UI resolution-independent. Inside of 10.5 is a huge set of tools that accomplish that fact, but it still had to look the same at current resolutions, and also look good at higher, which we haven't seen yet. The good results is that they can deploy a whole new system-wide, resolution-independent look & feel by replacing some XML and PNG files in the Appearance internal framework, and with no code changes.

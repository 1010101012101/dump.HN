3693083,comment,3690481,3692952,0,0,drostie,,,"I guess in the pseudo-analogy (universities are government-like), there is also indeed a pseudo-analogy of the form, ""if you don't like your government and its tax system, move somewhere else. Oh, you don't like any taxes? Well what did you expect -- that governance would be a free lunch?"" -- and that ""oh, you can change your government, it is subject to competition in a quite-unregulated market of international governance"" and so on. The larger point is that there is an opposition to governments which isn't opposed more generally to government-like structures -- and that arguments which libertarians would support for government-like structures are ones they would confidently reject for governments. (""I shouldn't have to change governments!"" becomes ""I shouldn't have to change universities"", or ""I can't change the government, I'm not a senator"" becomes ""I can't change the university, I'm not a dean."")<p>It seems, as you say, that the only distinguishing feature is its <i>size</i> -- that there is no libertarian <i>ideological</i> opposition to big government, because it's the same things that they ideologically support at small scale, but there is just a <i>pragmatic</i> opposition to big government because it is big. So all of the stuff about Initiation of Force is at best inconsistently applied and at worst total crap.<p>Now that works for most modern libertarians, but I think it would not work for Ayn Rand. More interesting are the libertarians who take a <i>doctrinaire</i> opposition to the government, but it really requires, as I said earlier, an anarcho-socialist vibe of ""governments shouldn't enforce real estate regulations or trademark laws, those are already Initiation of Force in some fundamental sense, 'don't walk here or I'll hurt you', 'don't say this name without my permission or I'll hurt you'.""",1331553033

3693079,comment,3690481,3690481,2,0,pseingatl,,,"The solution lays not with the accused, but their lawyers. The lawyers can simply refuse to defend cases and the system will crash. And no one, no poor defendant, will risk jail. In the 1960's there were ""committed"" lawyers who took a stand against the Draft, as well as legal organizations that took a stand--the National Lawyers Guild comes to mind. Unfortunately, the idealism of the 1960's turned to drug defense work in the 1970's and by the 1980's the pendulum had swung back and hard.\nEven if only a small group of lawyers refused to handle cases, such as federal Criminal Justice Act attorneys (18 USC 3006A) the system would not be able to cope. \nUnfortunately, it's easier to herd cats than to get lawyers to act in unison. But this is a better solution than asking the first few defendants to risk life sentences: no one wants to be the Wildebeest that enters the crocodile-infested river first. But a work stoppage by these lawyers would carry little risk of consequences other than a serious reassessment of the broken US criminal justice system.",1331552832

3693070,comment,3692257,3692257,2,0,cheatercheater,,,"One aspect of the ""rabbit hole"" problem is when you're doing work and you find a detail you want to read up on a bit more. You're doing Lisp and you want to read up on the best way to do a specific thing, then the best way to do a specific part of that, etc. The good old argument of parsing an infinite tree (graph) of information: Depth-first or breadth-first? Let's assume ""breadth"" means getting things done, and every new level of depth is going into a (maybe tangential) detail.<p>The great thing about a teacher is that they can find cycles in such graphs of related topics. They can use your attention to detail to steer you back on topic. Reading up on the trigonometric identities leads you to hyperbolic functions which leads you to holomorphic functions which leads you to linear algebra which leads you to a simple proof of trigonometric identities. It's a great thing if you figure something like this on your own.<p>There are other strategies to following the graph around. In fact, there's a topic called ""computational strategies"", which is fairly popular stuff if you're into supercomputing. Then on the other hand there are organizational measures like Time-Division Multiplexing, prioritizing, QoS, etc.. It's all been worked out, we really make computers in our own image. They can teach us a lot about ourselves.<p>I can equate reading up on new things (e.g. following HN closely every day) to juggling. Every time I read something new and interesting there's a new topic up in the air. It's there for some time until I've made my peace with it and integrated it into my consciousness.<p>I find that in my brain there's a certain amount of resource that I can dedicate to this sort of juggling, after which I gradually start getting tired, and ""burnt out on news"". At this point I start doing some fairly mechanical tasks. It often involves cleaning my flat, sports, shopping. Those are things which in some way tick boxes and they are a change for me which is the next step in the cycle. (Compare this to hanging out with friends or watching a movie or listening to music, which are passive tasks that do not advance the cycle for me.) After doing some of this practical stuff, I usually slow down reading up new stuff, forget about HN or whatever I was parsing, get caught up in real life. At this point I save all links, close it all off, and shelve it away. One thing that helps is that I have a structured database of resources (ok, just some dirs in dirs in dirs) where I save notes or webpages. This helps a lot to offload me from the burden of feeling I <i>HAVE</i> to read those articles. It's good because in the end most of this ""catching up"" that I do on HN is just to cross-reference topics and get new ideas; if two files are in the same dir (e.g. an ""Parsers"" dir) then I will end up looking at them two at the same time the next time I am working with parsers.<p>I have never been on a drinking binge, but externally - and as a voluntary social worker I've been a lot around people who have had strong problems with alcoholism - such a ""research cycle"" is very similar to a drinking binge. It starts with one sip, just let me look at the headlines on HN. Then I start taking shot after shot of reading the articles. Then I do it so much that I forget about everything. I'm in the zone. I'm in the flow. The world does not exist, I am <i>GOD</i>, the clarity is amazing. Escapism at its very best. At some point the high becomes tiring and I am unable to keep up. I get real-lifed. I start sobering up. By moving into doing something constructive I completely mitigate the crash.<p>So the cycle is start -> get infected -> totally binge out until you can't go further -> sober up -> do real life stuff -> back to start.<p>Of course, that's just one of the layers of my life, but it's a fairly well defined one at this point.<p>The cool thing is that, unlike sucking on the juice, this actually gets me to places. Maybe we should teach alcoholics Agda as rehab: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/njf59.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/njf59.png</a>",1331552488

3693062,comment,3692257,3692931,7,0,ttt_,,,"I feel the same way, and I like to have an approach I call just-in-time-learning. If you focus on formal education methods you often end up with a lot of time spent in knowledge that's not very interesting to you or that doesn't fall within your work/hobby real needs. In a just-in-time-learning methodology, you roll up your sleeves at the first sign of a lacking area in your knowledge that you need to tackle right now.<p>Of course that isn't without it's own pitfalls. That lacking area might need a bunch of pre-requisite knowledge you also don't have and would do if you had adopted a traditional approach early on. It also may lead you further into the rabbit hole if you don't put a stop to it somewhere along the way and turn back to the original problem.<p>Right now I feel that you have to be able to mix and match the approaches. Reserve some time for just-in-time and rabbit holes, but also remember to reserve some time for fundamentals too, in order to prepare for future lessons. So it is important to do a bit of studying about the subject in order to understand if that's the right fit or not for you.<p>Actually, I think the real drive for any kind of learning is about the same for anyone: curiosity.",1331552157

3693001,comment,3692684,3692684,5,0,drostie,,,"It's a cool building, but I was a little less thrilled when I read about their tech. It's true that an isothermal process is a reversible process, and isothermal air compression is therefore a great way to get high efficiencies, but compressed air just doesn't seem like it will scale well. The work formula for isothermal compression of an ideal gas is:<p><pre><code>    W = -  P dV = - n R T  dV / V =  P V ln(P / P).\n</code></pre>\nA shipping container holds 38.5 m according to the Wiki. At atmospheric pressure this would mean P V ~= 1 kWh. Cheap hardware might get you to 10 atm pressure or so -- but let's go crazy and suggest that you could get 100 atm, since it's only logarithmic in P anyway. You would still store less than 5 kWh per shipping container, no? That could run a window-unit air conditioner for about a day, only. If you pay 15 cents per kilowatt hour, you could fill up the shipping container with under $1 of electricity, only. My cell phone battery stores an amp-hour at around 3.5 V, so if the above calculation is right, to store the same amount of energy in 100-atm compressed air you'd need 27 liters of air -- two backpacks or so. I'm saying this to guesstimate that it's about a factor of 1,000 less energy density than modern battery technology -- and that that's a fundamental limitation to the medium.<p>Given all that, I'm really interested to see how they'll scale compressed air up to handle the sheer amount of energy that they want to store.<p>(On the other hand, the factor of 1000 might not matter too much: it means that if they can build a shipping container air storage unit cheaper than electronics companies can build a battery the size of three backpacks, they could indeed be cheaper to store energy en masse.)",1331550448

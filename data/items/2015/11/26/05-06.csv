You&#x27;ve got it all. THANK YOU for making this. Can&#x27;t wait to dive in and learn it!<p>Do I have to use LESS to use Gridlex? Or can I just link a CSS file on my web page and start using it?

Funny enough, Google localization is one thing that made me switch to DuckDuckGo. Somehow, Google thinks if my IP is from Latvia — it has to speak Latvian to me (which I&#x27;m admittedly a bit less comfortable with than English), if it&#x27;s from Netherlands — it has to speak Dutch (which I don&#x27;t speak at all). And (aside from manually adding bizzare GET-arguments into url) it doesn&#x27;t even allow me to chose language myself. One evening it asked me to confirm some user-agreement in Latvian before I&#x27;m allowed to continue using search, I got annoyed and said &quot;That&#x27;s enough&quot;.<p>Yes, in some languages Google search is sometimes superior, but the difference isn&#x27;t huge and I always can type &quot;!g something&quot; into DuckDuckGo if I need to (and I don&#x27;t have to confirm any user agreements in that case).<p>In fact, what still makes me use Google search sometimes isn&#x27;t localization or some clever heuristic features like flight search, but &quot;search by image&quot; feature. I don&#x27;t know any other engine that would do that nearly as good as Google. TinEye is left far behind, unfortunately.",1448517372

In a place like Los Angeles both mass transit and carpool/toll lanes are useless.<p>Due to a contract I&#x27;ve been driving a pleasure-filled 100 miles per day on the lovely 405 freeway for a number of weeks.  I&#x27;m not in a hurry, so I chill and kind of watch traffic like I&#x27;m not there.<p>What I see ever day is, well, ridiculous.<p>The carpool lane is a complete waste.  It effectively removes 20% to 25% of the road&#x27;s capacity without any real benefits at all.  Why?<p><pre><code>    - Cars with multiple passengers were going to have \n      multiple passengers, carpool lane or not\n    - Those cars were not removed from the road thanks to the \n      carpool lane:  No benefit\n    - Business trucks with multiple passengers? Same issue:  \n      They were going to have multiple passengers anyway\n    - Buses:  They go slow and plug-up the carpool lane\n      and actually create traffic jams.  Today I watched an \n      empty bus with probably 50 cars behind it going well\n      below the speed limit.  Crazy.\n    - Cargo trucks (like 24 footers).  Again, same problems:\n      They were going to have multiple passengers anyway,\n      they are going slow and cause congestion.\n    - Tons of cars with a single person break the rules and\n      use the carpool lane because nothing is enforced, \n      particularly at night\n\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s needed is a shift in mission, focus and concentration by two agencies:  Caltrans and CHP.  Maybe the DMV too, in that they&#x27;d have to push and experiment with new rules of the road.<p>Their mission should be to make the roadways as efficient as possible.<p>Don&#x27;t pull over the guy doing 80 in the fast lane who is getting the hell out of the way.  Pull over the dude doing 50 in the middle of the freeway and the nutcase one lane over doing 49.999 miles per hour who form a virtual &quot;cork&quot; in the road and create a pile-up behind them.<p>And all those people who somehow can&#x27;t press on the accelerator going uphill?  We must do something about them.  It&#x27;s unbelievable.<p>How about the guy doing 63.9 mph on the left lane who absolutely refuses to move over, creates a pile-up and has an asshole behind him driving one foot from his bumper?<p>Ah, and one of my favorites:  Let&#x27;s get on the freeway at 40 miles per hour because we are afraid of the accelerator or we just don&#x27;t give a shit!  Cars pile up, swerve around and a huge potential for a nasty accident is created when these fine folk enter our freeways.<p>Yes, we do have too many cars on the road, but they are also being driven in really stupid and inefficient ways, our agencies do exactly zero to improve the situation and, on top of that, lanes are taken away and road capacity is reduced for this imaginary idea of carpooling.<p>I really don&#x27;t think our highways are being used anywhere near peak efficiency.  In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the exact opposite were true.",1448516062

One relevant set of articles is on Dinomania -- the sudden and unexpected popularity of dinosaurs, specifically with a short story called &quot;Bully For Brontosaurus&quot; (same title as the book). The story kind of disects how Brontosaurus was a fought over label, and of course the Appatosaurus advocates won. The story ends with &quot;I retreat not with a bang of thunder, but with a whimper of hope that rectification may someday arise from the ashes of my stamp album&quot;.<p>If Steven were alive, he would have been happy to know that indeed rectification did happen!",1448514650

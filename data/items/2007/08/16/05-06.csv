The crazy thing about the place is, every time I ride the BART or sit down at a coffee shop there's someone sitting next to me that's either works at Yahoo/ebay/google/etc or is also doing a startup.  <p>Its really easy to start conversations with these people upon noticing a Django error page on their laptop or an ebay employee badge.  The conversations are great.  <p>Also there are lots of meetups, lectures and parties for startups.  The place just breathes technology (can be frustrating as well if you additionally like other things such as frisbee or women).",1187243884

42933,story,,,26,63,ahsonwardak,"Why is it hard to startup a company outside of Silicon Valley?",,"This may sound like a dumb question to some, but I need to be edified.  I'm in DC, and it seems more and more that you're probably working in something government or defense related.  In other cities, like Dallas, it used to be telecom related (The Telecom Corrdior).  How do these clusters start, thrive, and/or die?  How does it continue to thrive in Silicon Valley after some 20 to 30 years of startup success stories?",1187243321
42932,comment,42508,42802,0,0,ahsonwardak,,,"SwellJoe - To give the argument a different twist, it's hard for most people to hold different perspectives beyond their best core ability.  For many hackers, they're so engrossed in it, and for good reason.  As you say, they are smarter than average, and programming affords them the opportunity to execute their ideas easily.  Once you get so good at anything,  including hacking or, more specifically, software development, it becomes hard to think about usability, design, business development, etc.  Then, there arises a need for systems thinking or other thinkers with different areas of expertise.  Would you agree?",1187242876

If I'm really lucky they will have invented a room temperature superconductor by then so my now nearly frictionless train can fall across the country at break-neck speed with near zero energy expenditure. <p>",1187242233
42928,comment,42729,42729,0,0,ahsonwardak,,,"I'm always a fan of the technology solution to any problem, but it's fundamentally a policy problem.  Until, the health care system changes in this country for universal coverage, then the system will react in a positive way.  Perhaps, this could occur in the next generation.  At the same time, there's a market opportunity - more people to serve.",1187242231

At least we know that they care about their image on the Web.  It shows Wikipedia's significance as a credible source for information and the Web as a host for that source.  Wikipedia is almost meant to be an encyclopedia driven by anarchy.",1187241709
42926,comment,42892,42923,0,0,ed,,,"Just for fun i calculated the worst-case state space for a network assuming that the average node has 150 peers -- out to 6 hops you have roughly 10^13 unique paths. Not impossible to work with, but you'd have to get pretty clever to reduce the computing time to something practical.",1187241525

42923,comment,42892,42892,0,0,ed,,,"Wonder if you'd have enough user data exposed through the API to actually map out the relevant network... computationally it'd be fairly trivial to verify the user's guess, but you'd have a hell of a time actually calculating minimum distance with a dataset as large as Facebook's. That's why for the most part you won't see a social network telling you how two users are connected beyond a distance of two hops.",1187241233

You can get a list of your friends, but you can't do get a list of their friends - the best you can do is ask if two people are connected. you'd basically have to keep an offline list of the facebook web of connections.\n",1187240972
42921,comment,42702,42890,0,0,BrandonM,,,"What other fictional book from the 1900s forward would you recommend?  Personally, I considered myself quite liberal until I began reading this book.  I just kept finding the themes resonating with me, and I realized that she was really describing my philosophy and half the reasons behind the messes in society today.  It hasn't changed my morals so much as realigned my politics to agree with them.  The book has been singlehandedly responsible for converting me from a liberal to a libertarian.  Perhaps if more people read it, they would be less inclined to ""ride the system"" and would do some good for society.  Or maybe that's just wishful thinking....",1187240434

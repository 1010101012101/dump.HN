If your hiring process is not impartial, then it&#x27;s introducing undesirable bias into the hiring decision.<p>The classic example is sexism in orchestras. Orchestra interviews used to consist of the candidate sitting on a stage and performing their piece for a panel of judges. The gender ratio of performers was terribly skewed, even worse than the software development field is today. Orchestra managers excused this by saying that women were simply not as good -- after all, the judges scores don&#x27;t lie!<p>But a funny thing happens if you put the performers behind a screen. Suddenly, all the factors of their gender and race and grooming go away, and new performers start being a lot more diverse. There actually was a bias, a serious one, and it caused orchestras to lose who knows how many excellent candidates.<p>The current state of the art for programming interviews at big companies is to have the candidate solve actual programming problems, including whiteboard coding. It&#x27;s not practical to put the candidate behind a screen or modulate their voice, so splitting up the tasks of &quot;interview candidate&quot; and &quot;review interview feedback&quot; is the best that Google has figured out.",1378345619

Basically what this lets you do is write a value and only successfully save the update if a given column is the value you expect.<p>So for example you could have a &quot;records&quot; table that has a column called &quot;check&quot; whenever you update a record you pull the old one, do whatever processing you want to do on it, set the &quot;check&quot; column to a new UUID and then save it with a checkAndPut where you specify the &quot;check&quot; column in hbase has to be the old check value you read.  If any other process wrote to this row then it would have updated the check value with a new UUID and so this checkAndPut will fail thereby detecting the conflict.

Yeah, so the iPad sold 100 million units. The DS sold <i>154 million</i>. <i>For a single purpose device</i>. The 3DS might be 20% behind its predecessor&#x27;s curve -- a ridiculously successful curve, if I might say -- but that&#x27;s still a cold 124 million units. The Wii was a fad, true... and it redefined the meaning of fad itself, selling <i>100 million units</i>; a <i>one model</i>, <i>single-purpose device</i>. When factored into this that Nintendo <i>profits from third party software</i> -- unlike Rovio, which has to pay its dutiful tides to petulant lovers by excellance Apple and Samsung -- one starts clearly seeing how Nintendo is pulling ass like Brad Pitt at a wet t-shirt contest. Absolutely insane. Not even Steve Jobs could dream of selling a gadget so well as the 3DS does.<p>Not to mention that, again, in this business if you&#x27;re a third party developer, either your name is Activision, or you&#x27;re into masochism.

We believe that students can use the tools weve built to extend their college application beyond its numerical limits. There are approximately 16 million high school students in the U.S., and there are only so many SAT-score GPA combinations. We want students to stand out because of who they are.<p>Students can use the site for many valuable profile-building features, including uploading work history, community services, experiences, and other notable accolades. Built in to the network is also an interface for students to share course related material and endorse each others profile.<p>Teachers can sign up, create online classrooms, and upload course related material. Teachers can also interact with students and cultivate an efficient learning environment. By creating software where teachers can interact with students in an effective manner, we can increase AP Exam pass rates, increase college acceptances, decrease college attrition rates, and improve the overall quality of education.<p>RecruitedForCollege.com is completely free for students and teachers, and it always will be.

About a year and a half ago I finally got sick of it and installed Kubuntu.<p>Kubuntu 12.04 + 2 monitors + AMD proprietary drivers = you get to choose between accelerated OpenGL and multiple monitor support.  You can&#x27;t have both at the same time.  (At least I couldn&#x27;t, with the video card and driver versions I had 6 months ago.  I spent many hours trying, then remembered I have more money than time and bought a $90 Nvidia card.)<p>Kubuntu 12.04 + 2 monitors + Nvidia proprietary drivers = easy.  The GUI worked, first try, no problems.  The only goofy thing was that my left monitor showed up on the right side, giving me a choice between physically moving the monitors or changing the default positions in the GUI.  I changed the defaults in the GUI.<p>Also, on my former work machine, Kubuntu 11.04 and 12.04 + 2 Nvidia cards + 3 monitors = easy.  (Some cow-orkers had 2 Nvidia cards and 4 monitors, also easy.)<p>I haven&#x27;t tried newer versions of Kubuntu on a multi-monitor box, so it&#x27;s possible (but not likely) they&#x27;ve gone backwards.",1378343409

Mechanical keyboards are quite good at bursty sprint speeds in my experience. Sustained speed is another matter, I can see where the power return of each key press would cause soreness (like wearing shoes with springs), but its not a problem I have as a programmer who mostly just sprints.<p>> It&#x27;s about not averaging 10wpm once you&#x27;ve finished thinking and want to materialize your thoughts or revert a mistake.<p>Yes, but you don&#x27;t have that problem on a mechanical.<p>> My work is typing, primarily code and email.

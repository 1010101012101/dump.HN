272807,comment,272776,272776,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Patents are largely bullshit.  The only thing looking at patents can do for a you as a programmer is to give you a nasty case of brain cloud.  A few years ago, I spent a lot of time a few years ago looking at ""Internet TV"" related patents.  Any area that might be hot is patent trolled to death, and this was certainly true for video over the internet.  Best thing to do is to ignore it until people start becoming interested in you.",1218433956

He said it took ten years to ""become a success"", but that isn't limited to just one company. Personally, I plan on trying and failing as many times as necessary over the next 10 years until I get to be really good.",1218433840

I believe I have the same screen - those Samsungs are really great.<p>I am currently working at home - but I still unplug the laptop daily to move around.  The extra screen is extremely helpful.<p>I have recently been considering getting a new desktop however - since I would prefer 3+ large monitors.",1218433684

272800,comment,272776,272776,0,0,micks56,,,"The short answer to how close you can be is you don't know till you end up in court. Now, for the longer explanation.<p>The Supreme Court of the US has ruled that patents can be obtained for ""anything under the sun."" Exceptions carved out by the same court are for laws of nature, maths, and abstract ideas.<p>So you can't patent F=ma, but things in web e-mail clients could be patented.<p>There is no way to tell if you are infringing without actually reading the patent claims. So until the patents are granted, you don't have anything to analyze.<p>Also, their patented claims do not have to be identical to what you are doing. If it is obvious to someone skilled in the art that what you are doing is a modification of what your competitor is doing, then that could also be infringement. This is why you see the language ""in one embodiment"" in patents. The drafters are not limiting themselves to the claimed implementation, but are trying to do a land grab that people skilled in the art would do after reading this application.<p>In legalese this is called the doctrine of equivalents. The United States section on the wikipedia page for doctrine of equivalents is currently accurate. You will see the standard there.",1218432350

272792,comment,272776,272776,0,0,chaostheory,,,"disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer, I'm not giving you advice, and you should talk to a lawyer.<p>Just remember one really important thing: letting people know that you have knowingly infringed on a specific patent increases the damages awarded to the patent holder. Never talk specifics unless you're talking to your own lawyer.",1218431200
272791,comment,272635,272635,0,0,neilk,,,"I have been on a project where the manager ignored Brooks' Law, and was well-funded enough to actually get away with it. He preferred to get lots (LOTS) of interns and first-time developers from top schools, presumably on the theory that they were smart and willing to work insane hours. But this team was also well-disciplined in writing tests and readable code, and did follow a lot of Agile processes. Pretty much every part of the codebase was accessible to every developer, and it was common to submit patches to other people's work.<p>So this was a good experiment to test the posted article's thesis; lots of good processes, Open-Source-like development style, giant team.<p>I wouldn't call the result a trainwreck, exactly, but neither do I ever want to experience that again.<p>It got to the point where some were openly calling for half the team to be fired; not due to incompetence but because we were digging ourselves deeper into refactoring debt every day. The ratio of ""code written to work around misdesigns"" versus ""code that achieves something"" approached 1:1, at least in my experience. At least two different frameworks sprouted up among the developers to work around each others' bugs.",1218431083

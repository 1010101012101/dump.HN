1831777,comment,1827928,1831292,0,0,kijinbear,,,"> it also prevents people with absolutely valid (but free) certificates from offering perfectly good encryption on their sites. This warning is misguided and does more to prevent the secure use of the web than anything else.<p>Accepting self-signed certificates would not be a good solution. Anybody can sign a certificate with ""www.facebook.com"" in the Common Name field. Your communication would be encrypted, but you'd be communicating with the wrong guy. SSL was designed to provide both encryption and identification. Self-signed certificates provide only encryption.<p>Besides, certificates are already quite cheap if you know where to buy them. RapidSSL costs as low as $12/yr, which is just slightly more than the cost of a domain name, and it's recognized by all browsers including IE6. I wouldn't consider it ""prohibitively expensive"" if it costs less than two lunches.<p>There are, of course, many other ways in which the existing infrastructure is inadequate. Take a look at the list of CAs that your browser automatically trusts. It's a mess. But it's not easy to implement an alternative that can provide both encryption and identification with the degree of reliability that the current infrastructure has. Some kind of social trust mechanism might work, but we're a long way from standardizing on anything of the sort.",1288043552

Nevertheless it seems that some people still do find it useful to keep a notebook with them, and are generally still interested in the process of writing things down—even while the majority seems to think that writing by hand is a skill as worthy of personal development as, say, horse-buggy skills.<p>For several years now I've been developing my own system of shorthand. It started as, simply, my own system of letter shapes, because I had terrible handwriting—I just devised a single, consistent, attractive character set for myself and then trained myself to use it exclusively and always, so that my handwriting was more attractive and even.<p>But as these things go—informed by a personal interest in historical text systems—I started to include extra-alphabetical characters into the mix. First an ampersand, then a couple special double characters, a dollar sign; quickly I moved on to ligatures—some pre-existing in the Roman alphabet, but some of my own creation. And then characters for common words, prefixes, suffixes. I started using superscripts and subscripts and drawing inspiration from historical scripts like old Anglo Saxon writing, Tironian Notes, the Abbreviationes of the Middle Ages, et cetera. And so now I've got a relatively sophisticated system with several hundred different characters in it, and a whole set of rules of composition.<p>Partly this is an exercise in efficiency—my writing is much shorter and faster than plain English—but it's also an aesthetic undertaking. I do derive a lot of artistic pleasure from it, from the system of it, and from the look of it on the page.<p>So my question is: does anybody care about this? Of all the people I've told about it, many of them thought it looked awesome when I showed it to them, but only one person ever expressed any interest in learning it for himself, and so I don't even know how learnable it is. I wonder if there's some geeky demographic out there on the web who would find value in my documenting the whole thing, writing a couple explanatory essays, scanning all the characters, etc., et cetera. If there isn't, by the way, that's ok. Like I said, I am quite proud of it for its own sake and it's fun to trot out at geeky parties. But if I thought that I'd get any kind of response from the web at large, I'd think hard about putting in the (non-trivial) effort to really document the whole thing and try to make it as learnable as possible.",1288043353

Then things like this wouldn't matter, no?</i><p>GNOME has never clearly defined the confines of what kind of differentiation is ""doing GNOME"", and what kind is ""breaking away from GNOME"". There's also no clear answer to the question of whether GNOME should be a complete end-user product, or a supermarket for makers of end-user products to pick and choose components from, or something in between, or something else.<p><i>Every</i> distribution patches GNOME. Just about nobody ever uses GNOME as it comes in the tarballs, except for development and bug triage. Moblin, Maemo (now together as MeeGo), OLPC, Nokia and others have shipped vastly differentiated systems meant for different niches built on the GNOME stack, without much anybody labeling them as infidels. If people suddenly hold Ubuntu to a different standard <i>solely on the grounds of differentiation</i>, that's not fair.<p>Differentiation or fragmentation are not going to be the actually problematic parts of the switch to Unity from a community standpoint. The two worst bits of news are: 1) that as an unaffiliated contributor who intends to fix or improve a major part of Ubuntu's default desktop environment, you didn't have to sign a disturbing contributor agreement that doesn't guarantee the freedom of your code in the future until now, but from now on, you probably will 2) Ubuntu's default desktop environment is now a single-stakeholder product that one company will exert very strong control over, regardless of how well they handle the community side.

You have to very carefully make sure the internal representations match up, and it's tricky enough that it's not done very often.

Probably more significant is the legion of Java developers that have been vocal proponents of Macs over recent years.  The numbers of such developers might not be so great in an absolute sense, but the amount of noise they create is disproportionate.

OK, that's pretty expensive.<p>1s (12 pence) gets you a dinner at a steakhouse with beer... yep, sixty bucks is a plausible price for a steak dinner.

(!)<p>So in conclusion, if you take the one penny to five dollars conversion, then some things (basic foodstuffs) seem expensive while others (labour) seem cheap. This is consistent with the fact that people were much poorer (in real terms) back then, and you'd have to chop wood for 40 minutes just to buy a loaf of bread.<p>It still seems like a weird way to use money, but I guess that's just because I've grown up in a world where it's entirely possible to undercut your competition by 1% on the price of a loaf of bread.

The advantage Typekit has is that it gives you access to a lot of font choices to use (which you wouldn't otherwise have access to) and hosts/serves up the fonts for you.<p>Sites not using Typekit are most likely just using their own @font-face solution and hosting the fonts on their own server (which can also be a faster solution than loading in 3rd party font solutions).<p>Never use fonts and just hope a user might have it. It's not too hard to roll your own solution for serving up pretty fonts using @font-face. You will need to read up on it to learn the ins and outs, and what sort of goofy idiosyncrasies exits that you need to deal with.<p>I would recommend using the @font-face generator from fontsquirrel.com (<a href=""http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator</a>).  This helps you take a font you want to use and prepare it for the web, creating all the different font file types, as well as creating the css you need to use to embed the font for use.<p>When you use the font, be sure to use it as part of a font-family, so that you can plan what fonts to use as a fallback in case your @font-face declarations don't work out.<p>Understand that your font will be rendered differently between various browsers and operating systems.  Sometimes using a css declaration like text-shadow (text-shadow: #FFF 0px 0px 1px;), and matching the text-shadow color to the background color the text is on, can help smooth out jaggies on the rendered font (works well for webkit browsers), YMMV. Definitely check out how your font looks in all the major browsers, as well as different OS platforms.  For instance, I have found Windows XP to render some @font-face fonts much worse than say Windows 7.<p>Just know that things aren't quite perfect yet with @font-face, so think long and hard about using it in a production environment, and really test all platforms, browsers, etc to see how it looks. Understand how your choice to use a custom font might hurt readability for large blocks of small-sized text (like a blog post) because of rendering issues. Also, Remember to use custom fonts responsibly, you really shouldn't need more than 1 (2 max) custom fonts on a page. Some people get a little carried away.<p>Some free fonts you can use online.

It is a strange situation. Your company will be worth more to investors during the hopes and dreams phase than it will be worth while you are crossing the chasm. So you should raise enough capital at hopes and dreams valuations to get across. If you don't, a down round is waiting for you as yet another challenge while you are crossing the chasm.<p>Companies with no revenues but big potential are worth whatever the market will bear. But once you have revenues and are heading towards earnings, the market will be able to better assess what you are worth. Revenues and earnings multiples will enter the valuation discussions. And most of the time, revenues and earnings multiples will result in a lower number than hopes and dreams, at least for a while.</i>",1288041050

Half a year later, you are supposed to write middle sized projects in Delphi and Java. Second-year student learns C++, and then chooses between further C++, Python, C# or CUDA/OpenCL classes. C is used in Operating Systems courses, Oracle and PostgreSQL on Databases, PHP, Javascript (JQuery) and Python (Django) on Web Applications. Prolog, Smalltalk and Haskell are used in Compilers classes. Students use language of choice on Team Programming Project.<p>These are all obligatory, one can additionally attend optional courses on Prolog, Dylan, Common Lisp and some other I do not recall now.<p>So yeah, learning C better would take time needed for all these courses and thus would narrow one's view. From my experience, most people do not like to use C for anything other than Algorithms classes, and even then they are more likely to use C + STL than plain C. Those who do can take Advanced Operating Systems classes and tinker with Linux kernel, or Microcontroller Programming.",1288041003

I was able to get the same data I could have if I statically programmed SQL queries onto my code, and I didn't care if I executed 1 or 50 queries for each page that loaded. Who cares if SomeGuyJoe's site does this. If what his site does works, who cares how it is done.<p>When I decided I wanted to learn more, I started to learn what the abstractions did, and hacked and changed it to be better for my particular use. Then I moved on to lower level languages, and now I have a decent understanding of how to write my own abstractions, yet I still use abstractions because they let me focus more on what I am wanting to do, instead of how to do the things that let me do it.<p>This post could be changed to say that anyone that learns a higher level language is harming themselves. The skills and syntax you learn from Python cannot be used in C# or Java, so you should just learn assembly. It is all machine code in the end and these languages are just facades. Only real men program by moving bits to registers.",1288040985

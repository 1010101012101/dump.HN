It's the one math book that I've worked out from cover to cover. The problems are high quality as well. I have fond (and frustrating!) memories of working them out.<p>I have his other 2 books as well - Adult Rudin & Functional Analysis. Sadly, I never really got into those (as my mathematical interests diverged somewhat from Analysis).<p>The only other book that I've read that comes close to Baby Rudin's exposition is Gamelin's Topology - an underrated classic.",1274523947
1370113,comment,1369878,1369878,0,0,_delirium,,,"I used it in a computational-media class a few years ago, where it was the main language used for the examples and projects. Since I was a CS student and already comfortable in a bunch of languages (much of the class wasn't), I wasn't really the target audience, but I thought it was reasonably well done for what it is. You can get some graphical stuff happening on screen in only a few lines of code, and the IDE automates building a Java applet that you can ship just by copying a directory to a webserver, both of which, I think, increase the satisfaction to someone just starting out with programming, because you can immediately see the effect of relatively simple programs. It's actually a <i>lot</i> nicer than Java for simple 2d graphics stuff, because it gets rid of a lot of the boilerplate, and includes some decent built-in primitives. And you can escape to Java if things get complex.<p>I've used it a few times since then as a rapid-prototyping tool for 2d graphics stuff, mostly interactive graphics toy type of stuff, and I think it's pretty good for that. HTML5 Canvas is getting to the point where it'll probably replace it for that purpose for me, but when Processing came out in the early 2000s, there wasn't much comparable when it came to getting some interactive graphics working in a web browser in <10 lines of code.",1274523866

1370110,comment,1368881,1370075,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> I work at a startup, love it, and will probably work at or start another startup in the future<p>Doesn't that sort of prove my point though? Why not stick around and grow it then?<p>Isn't the 'what kind of person you are' part the whole point of what I wrote ?<p>Some people are good at creation and the work that comes with that small team where you can wear a whole bunch of hats, they thrive in that environment, but they find that it is much harder to maintain that attitude in larger companies.<p>Suddenly there are procedures and forms to be filled out and all kinds of corporate stuff that will drag you down. You can only work on weekdays, you have to work between 9 and 5 (hey, I'm a night person), and so on.<p>I remember that when working for a large corporation (bank) early on in my career after I switched to the IT department someone came up to me and asked me not to work so hard because I made some of the others on the team look bad. They were actually trying to <i>slow me down</i>, can you imagine that sort of thing in a start-up?<p>I'd work for any start-up that has a technically challenging idea, even without pay if the idea was worthwhile enough in my opinion, but I'd have a really hard time joining up with some 200 employee company that does the same thing, or hanging around if the idea was received well by the market and the company needed growing to that level.<p>Sooner or later your tech days are over and you'll find yourself to be a 'manager', and not everybody is cut out to be one. The choice then is to hang on to the start-up that you helped found and manage people or to hang on and be managed by some guy hired two years after you founded the thing.<p>I'd rather move on at that stage. In the past this has led to school friends of mine that had also gone in to programming to be hired by start-ups that I helped found, 20 years on and they're still working there.<p>I could have <i>never</i> done that, compared to what I've seen in the last 20 years that sounds like being tied to the same disneyland ride for two decades.",1274523782

I've seen a few others and for the most part the attackers find themselves at -4 or banned pretty swiftly.<p>The only real 'celebrity posters' I can think of are PG, patio11, cperciva, tptacek and jgrahamc and their reputations are well established and deserved in the fields they write most about, for the most part their votes seem to reflect the quality of what they write on a case-by-case basis.<p>For example, it's rare to see PG downvoted because most of the time what he writes makes very good sense (and I've been on the receiving end of a couple of 'you disagreed with PG downvotes' but it does happen, and that, as far as I'm concerned proves that the problem if it exists is not that large.<p>So inspite of the research referenced above and personal experience, even if it does happen we don't have a cult of celebrity worship here as far as I can see, but at the same time we're talking about a bunch of counters in a disk file somewhere, so assuming that we do it <i>still</i> isn't a problem.
